Twyman I first heard of Nicholas de Vere on an internet chat group; typically anenvironment where people pretend to be something they are not, using theiranonymity as an excuse to behave even more boorishly than they do in real life.On this chat group, we had recently been discussing the theories presented inLaurence Gardner’s book Genesis of the Grail Kings. The list was suddenlyflooded with emails declaring that Mr. Gardner’s work was not to be trustedbecause he had once been involved with the unscrupulous “Nicholas de Vere”, or,as one detractor called him, “Tom Weir.” The gist of the claim was that Mr. deVere, who said he was a member of the “Grail bloodline” (the subject of thediscussion list) had fabricated a royal genealogy, invented a royal magicalorder called “The Dragon Court”, which he bogusly declared to be ancient, andstood to make lots of money by selling admission to this order, as well as thesales of his book, From Transylvania to Tunbridge Wells (now called The DragonLegacy)—a book which, according to the emails, was utter nonsense and not worthreading. Being the individualistic type that I am, my natural inclination upon being toldnot to read something by self-serving know-it-alls is to seek it outimmediately. This I did, easily locating Nicholas de Vere’s book, which was, atthat time posted for free in its entirety on the Dragon Court website—hardly theact of an unscrupulous con man wishing to make big bucks off of a bogus claim. Iprinted out the entire thing and sat down on my bed to read, highlighter in handto mark off anything important. A day and a half later, I had slept little,consumed lots of coffee, and was sitting in front of a manuscript half-coveredin pink highlighter. For the first in my life, I had discovered another personwho thought exactly the same way I did about the Grail, and the Grail bloodline.Everything within this book corroborated the theories, speculations, and ideasthat we had been writing about in a book of my own, many of them ideas that Ihad held for a long time, but never been able to prove. Yet here was a manclaiming to speak for that very bloodline and ancient tradition which I had beenstudying, and stating with assuredness what I had been hesitantly proposing. * The title of this essay comes from a song of the same name by the English bandDeath in June. De Vere painted a picture of the beginnings of the Grail bloodline in anantediluvian civilization, with a super-human, red-haired race of Grail kingsthat conquered and ruled over the primitive hordes of the ancient world, withtribes on each continent. It provided the royal houses which guided the destinyof all civilized man. They were overseers, “navigators”, directing the affairsof the world with the Solomonic wisdom inherent in their blood. They watchedover a perfect caste-ordered society, in which all people worked and livedwithin their proper station, creating a harmonious, inter-dependent andrespectful relationship between the classes. They created all of the traditions,customs and institutions upon which civilization depends, and of which ourcurrent traditions, customs and institutions are pathetic bastardizations. Infact, I would assert that the Dragon tradition has proven to be the verydefinition of “tradition” itself. As amazing as it was to find these ideas, identical to my own, in de Vere’sunpublished manuscript, what was truly astounding were the more metaphysicalaspects of the theory, again chillingly close to my own ideas. To de Vere, it isthe blood itself which provides the basis for the “divine right” of Dragons tobe the overseers of society, and this is what sets them apart from the rest ofhumanity, as gods are from mortals. This is the reason why, originally, theyrefused to mate outside of their race, and the reason why, later, they indulgedin blood-drinking rituals in which the sacred Grail DNA could be consumed. Butperhaps most amazing of all, de Vere states that Grail blood contains genesspecifically programmed for “magic.” Dragons, and only Dragons, can perform magic, and are therefore the onlyauthentic Witches, according to de Vere. For that reason, magic has always beenan exclusive, secretive, royal art, and those outside of the bloodlineattempting to perform such experiments are doomed to failure. We see thesefailures walking amongst us everyday, and we can smell the mixture of self-pityand patchouli oil a mile away. This book lays down for the first time the scientific principles behind theeffective use of ritual magic, and why some “magicians” are more effective thanothers. It explains the significance of the “Grail bloodline”, irrespective ofmodern pseudo-intellectual theories and religious doctrines. It reveals the trueimport behind age-old tales of Vampires, Elves, Fairies, etc. It gives areasonable explanation for the otherwise inexplicable course of man’s history,all the way back to the Golden Age of the gods, and man’s fall from the grace ofthe natural state of affairs. It lays down the principles behind a fair andordered society; something we once, during the Golden Age, took for granted. Itsets the foundation for a true understanding of man’s natural hierarchy, andissues a death warrant for civilization should this fail to occur. De Vere writes from the perspective of a lone wolf, a man who fears neitherdeath nor life, and lives for the purpose of being. He writes to satisfy hispersonal impulse towards self-expression; to put the truth as he sees it down onpaper—not to convince anyone else. He is a self-contained entity. He needsnothing and no one outside of himself. Yet he represents and defends theworldview of an entire race of men—or, shall I say, “overmen”—with whom heshares a genetic, familial relationship. To him that is the only humanrelationship that fully counts, that truly deserves the superior man’s time,effort and emotion. All else is the puerile sentimentalism of the degeneratemasses. Beyond his loyalty to his kinfolk, de Vere’s true fidelity lies with theorder of the universe, and that transcendental principle which ordinary men knowlittle of but refer to blindly as “God.” De Vere is an iconoclast, an eccentricgenius. He has all the qualities of the great writers and thinkers of history.In his philosophy I put him on the same shelf as Julius Evola, or maybe next toOswald Spengler. His historical perspective places his work amongst classicslike Ignatius Donnelly’s Atlantis: The Antediluvian World, or L.A. Waddell’s TheMakers of Civilization in Race and History. His encyclopedic knowledge of occulttraditions, their true meanings and origins, is superior perhaps to that of A.E.Waite, Manly Hall, or Israel Regardie. In the future, this book will beindispensable to all serious students of the true occult tradition. “Hekas hekas este bebeloi!” (“Begone, begone, ye profaners”) It is safe to say that nothing is sacred in the writings of Nicholas de Vere,except that which is, by nature, sacred, because it pertains to that which ispure spirit. He does not reserve any pity for the sensitivities of patheticliberalisms, and makes mincemeat of the modern pseudo-religions: The Cult ofChildren*, the Cult of the Goddess, the Cult of the Oppressed, the Cult ofEquality, and the Cult of Economy. Likewise ritualistically slaughtered are thesupposedly “right wing” and “conservative” cults such as those of Race,Religion, and Nationalism. This book is likely to anger people; namely: a. Liberals will not like this book because it dares to point out that not allmen are created equal, nor are all men necessarily members of the same species.It shows that nature has assigned a caste system to various types of people, andthat society works better when those castes are kept intact. People are happierwhen not forced, expected, or encouraged to live either above or below theirnatural station in life. b. Catholics will be upset by what de Vere has to say about their holyinstitution. They will also not be pleased with De Vere’s lax attitude towardssuch contentious issues as incest, homosexuality, cannibalism, blood-drinking,and human sacrifice. * It is well-known in the advertising industry that any product or idea can besold by implying that the “children of the world” will somehow benefit. Thisassertion is usually followed by the sickening catchphrase “children are thefuture”, as if every sniveling rug rat were somehow paramount to thecontinuation of time. In reality, “the future” may be found in only a fractionof a percent of those children, and feeding an out of control population ofdegenerates is not going to further any worthwhile goals. c. New Age people will be upset to read, from someone who clearly knows whathe’s talking about, that their incense, candles and figurines are nothing morethan a drain on their bank account. (This bank account undoubtedly came with apersonalized dragon-themed checkbook that says “The Goddess is alive and magicis afoot.”) The reason for this is because the vast majority of these people arephysiologically incapable of performing magic, according to de Vere. d. White supremacists will be upset because, as tempting as it will be for themto connect their cause to the Dragon heritage, they won’t be able to. De Veredescribes the kinfolk which these people come from as slave races fit mostly forfield labor. He also dismisses out of hand their precious \"Fatherland\" idea andtheir pathetic nation-worship. e. Finally, de Vere assures me that his work will be offensive to thoseupper-crust Englishmen and “tinker nobility” who still uphold the farce ofVictorian values and artistic tastes. Being an American, I am not exposed to“Victorian values” very often, so I cannot comment on this matter any further. “After a long sleep, the same theories reappear. Without doubt they returnricher and with new clothes, but the foundation remains the same, and the newmask which they wear should not mislead the man of knowledge.”—Le Serpent Rouge De Vere’s manifesto portrays a rather pessimistic attitude towards the idea ofsocial progress, implying that the Golden Age of Dragon hegemony is foreverlost, never to return. This is something with which I do not agree. In fact, Ican see de Vere’s book playing the role of the revolutionary harbinger,welcoming back a lost era. The word “revolution” implies revolving, returning ina circular pattern to the original starting point, like the labyrinthine spiralof history which Nick discusses later in this volume. All of the points inhistory therefore issue from, and are based upon the unchanging center, thatwhich is “a priori”, like the snake biting its tail which the Dragon Court usesin its insignia. Nature has a way of correcting imbalances, of restoringelements to their rightful place. Yet before that can happen, we must all bereminded of what the natural order actually is. Pseudo-intellectuals like to annoyingly quote the tired adage, “Those who forgethistory are condemned to repeat it.” I say that unless we are reminded of theGolden Age of history we will be unwilling, unmoved, and unable to replicate itin our modern era. This book is like a spell calling forth the forces that ruledthousands of years ago, calling them back to once again hold dominion over us. Within the pages of this volume we, as Dragons (and I consider myself amongthem), declare our intention to take back what is rightfully ours. If the powersof God and nature are on our side, how can we fail? “Might is right” is apopular motto amongst those who label themselves “Social Darwinists.” While theprinciple holds true, a more proper way to express it would be to say that“right is might”. That is, if you are acting righteously in accord with what isright for you, attempting to take hold of the power that is rightfully yours,nature will equip you with the might necessary to accomplish that task.Materialism is the lie, brought to the forefront by the mercantile class soloathed by de Vere, which has caused the decay of society to its current level. People have whole-heartedly swallowed the assertion that “money is power”(outdone only by the equally offensive “time is money.”) Even those who haveattempted to rebel against materialism, such as the Hippies of the ‘60s era, orthe Communists of the 20th century, have always fallen into the materialistlogic trap. They mistakenly believed that the problem of materialist elitismcould be cured by redistributing the material wealth of rich people, andpreventing the accumulation of wealth, as if wealth itself were the problem,instead of the people who own it. Foolishly they chanted slogans like, “There isno war but class war”, and made statements like, “Every war in history wasfought over money”, when in fact almost every war can be traced back to aspiritual origin, a conflict between deeply held beliefs, ideas, and culturalnorms. It may be true that, as a general rule, those with true power use that power toacquire wealth, and that those who are wealthy often use it to empowerthemselves. But the fact is that the two concepts—money and power—are twoentirely different things. Money is a tool. It can be a reward for goods orservices provided, a means of acquiring things that are needed, and a way ofenabling projects to come to fruition. If it weren’t for the fact that certainpeople have acquired large sums of money, nothing of any consequence would everhappen—no wars, no monuments, no research and development. But removed from thecontext in which it is being used, money is meaningless. It is a purelycontingent phenomenon. Power, however, is something transcendental. Unlikemoney, it is not something that was invented by mankind as a means to an end. Itissues directly from God, and from Nature herself. There is such a thing aspower for power’s sake; and power, in the civic realm, is based on sovereignty,which comes from the blood. Therefore, true power resides not in a person’s bankaccount, but in their DNA. There it rests within most of us, potential energywaiting to be converted into kinetic energy through actual use. But most peopleare too weak of will, too lazy and unimaginative to make use of it. Even manypeople of the Dragon blood have sunk into this abyss of uselessness. But the time for rest and relaxation is over now. We are charged with theresponsibility of saving civilization, as the only people who are clear-sightedenough and capable of doing so. “Cease to Resist!”—The Beach Boys, paraphrasing Charles Manson This book is part of a literary zeitgeist currently in manifestation that isdestined to usher in a new era amongst the intelligentsia of the Western world,something I have termed “the Renaissance of the Arcadian Mystique.” Already muchof the groundwork has been laid by the popular Laurence Gardner books Genesis ofthe Grail Kings and Dragon Realms of the Ring Lords. These titles share muchcommon ground with this book, The Dragon Legacy, which was completed in an earlyform back in 1997. But there is much work yet to be done. The job of writers,artists and philosophers such as de Vere and I is not to bring about thepolitical revolution which looms on the horizon. That is the job of the men ofaction who belong to our cause, the born leaders of the Dragon blood who havebeen waiting and planning in the shadows for centuries, patiently plotting andmanipulating in anticipation of the opportunity to act. They need no help inthat regard. Rather, it is the job of the literary and artistic set to effectthe intellectual revolution, which must precede the political revolution. It isour job to clear the path ahead, to prepare the hearts and minds of the populacefor what is to come, and to erase all fear, doubt, and resistance. We need not worry that the ideological climate is so seemingly hostile to thevalues of blood, spirit, and hierarchy that we promote. The masses have no willof their own, beyond that which is given to them by those who assert themselvesas their superiors. We live in a multi-national culture that considers taking ona new ideological system to be equivalent to putting on a Tshirt. They willattach themselves to any idea which is effectively marketed so as to takeadvantage of their frail psychology. The occurrences on the 11th of September,2001 proved that beyond question. Overnight, the American values of libertarianindependence, personal freedom, an inherent “right to privacy”, and a healthymistrust of authority gave way to state-worship, rabid religious moralism, pithysentimentality, and a general attitude of compliance towards “whatever’snecessary to keep us safe.” All that was necessary to achieve the result was topush the right buttons. A Blue Light Special in the Marketplace of IdeasWe have been told that our democratic society is a free “marketplace of ideas.”Since democracy is also capitalistic, it only makes sense that the “marketplaceof ideas” embodies the same principles as our economy. The laws of supply anddemand dictate what ideas are considered valuable, which beliefs are valid, andtherefore which truths exist. By right of popularity, even the laws of physicscan be accepted, rejected, or altered at will. But most ideas are cheap, worthless, crap; both the popularly-held ideas and themajority of the rebellious “counter-ideas” presented by the numerous“counter-cultures.” Better that the intellectuals of today all dedicatethemselves to promoting and exploring a single priceless, transcendental idea.They can then find the best ways to defeat all competing, inferior ideas, ratherthan wasting their lives trying to come up with their own original (they dream)bad ideas, or, worse yet, trying to promote a conglomerate of meaningless andcontradictory herd ideas which they regard as worthy by right of theirpopularity. A book like this is meant to penetrate into the intellectual, educated class ofsociety, sowing the seeds of Draconian ideals, on hopes that they fall onfertile ground, grow, and pollinate the popular culture a la “trickle down”theory. It is then up to the intellectuals who have been won over to our side tosolidify the ideological revolution in the popular mind. All that is trulynecessary for this to occur, once the literate set has been fully indoctrinated,is an eye-catching symbol, and a memorable slogan, then the constant repetitionof these two in conjunction until no one can remember a time when these ideashad not been accepted and understood. It is not necessary to argue, debate, ordefend these ideas, but only to assert them as the absolute truths that theyare. Wishy-washy discussion which considers the merits of opposing views merelyinvites attack and ridicule. However, truths spoken with authority andconfidence have the mesmerizing effect upon the populace for which we areaiming. Once they are willing to accept, even demanding a transition back to theold, true order, and Draconian traditional values, we can remove the tyranniesof democracy and capitalism, putting to bed once and for all this moronicconcept of the “marketplace of ideas.” There is but one real idea, and we musthold true to it unswervingly. When we vacillate, when we stop to consideralternative ideas, we lose. We must surpass the intellect of the populace andaim at the soul. Gustave le Bon wrote in The Crowd: “All founders of religious or political creeds have established them solelybecause they were successful in inspiring crowds with those fanatical sentimentswhich have as result that men find their happiness in worship and obedience andare willing to lay down their lives for their idols”. This is the effect we are going for, and this monumental text put forth byNicholas de Vere shall go a long way in promoting that cause. Thanks to him andto others like him (although there truly are no others like him), the future ofthe Dragon blood trembles with the awesomeness of its glorious potential. Ourdestiny awaits.

Editor, Dagobert’s Revenge Magazine "},{"pageContent":"[images/00055.jpg] The Imperial and Royal Dragon Court of the Dragon Sovereignty: Sarkany Rend1408; Curia Regis et Ordo Draconis The Imperial and Royal Dragon Court of the Dragon Sovereignty intends tocontinue to publish individual aspects of its history, along with references tothe classical folklore and mythic customs of Europe and Asia which are directlylinked to the Dragon tradition. We trust that readers of this work will find the given details sufficient tocement the facts pertaining to the “Dragon” peoples, the Dragon Sovereignty andits Court. As defined within the main body of the following text, the Imperial and RoyalDragon Court represented herein, legitimately recognised as the Sovereign Courtof The Sovereign Dragon Nation by the relevant and appropriate Government of aEuropean Member State, is a closed fraternity of individuals, representing thosewho trace their ancestry and affiliations back to the ancient Grail and Dragonfamilies. A Closed FraternityWhen the Imperial and Royal Dragon Court was reconstituted by King Sigismund in1408 as the Societas Draconis, it was based upon an ancient bloodline traditionwhich Sigismund assumed that he had inherited from his presumed Egyptian andScythian ancestors through the Pictish, Dragon Princess Maelasanu of Northumbriaand the Ancient and Original Angevin Royal House of Vere of Anjou, the ImperialDukes of Angiers. This line had descended through the Tuatha de Danaan (the Dragon Kings of Anu)on the one hand, and the Egyptian Dragon Dynasty of Sobek on the other. Thelatter strain included the bloodline of the Davidic House of Judah who marriedinto the descent of the Merovingian Kings of the Franks. Human VanitiesEmperor Sigismund (as he was styled from 1410) was a son of the House ofLuxembourg—dynasts who flagrantly altered their genealogy in order to be able toclaim a fraudulent descent from this Dragon Dynasty of Maelasanu and Anjou. Itis from this descent—from Maelasanu or Melusine—and upon her British, laterAngiers-Angevin, Dragon Court, that Sigismund claimed the right to base SocietasDraconis as a bloodline continuation of this ancient, prehistoric,anti-Christian, pre-Catholic, British Elven Institution. One of the most famous members of Sigismund’s misappropriated organisation wasVlad Basarrab or Draculea, the son of Vlad Drakul. After Draculea’s death, hisson Michael wrote that his father proudly claimed a linear descent from thePriests of the Dragon Court of Queen Sobekh Nefru of Egypt, whose predecessorAmenhemet had built the Dragon Labyrinth of Fayyum—dedicated to Sobekh—which waslater copied in Crete as the Labyrinth of the Minotaur. Dynastic DeceptionsThe genealogy of the House of Drakul, Dracula or Basarrab is well known andwidely documented. Descending from Atilla the Hun, this family was establishedin Central Europe by the sons of Ghengis Khan. No bloodline with which the Houseof Basarrab was associated or allied in marriage at that time had anyaffiliation with any extraction that was remotely related with the dynasties ofEgypt. It is obvious, therefore, that Draculea or Dracula must have been claiming anapostolic succession, a spiritual priestly lineage deferring to the EgyptianDragon Court of Sobekh Nefru through Sigismund’s assumed descent from Melusine.Her ancestry actually can be traced back to the Scythian Dragon Princess Scota,Queen Sobekh Nefru and the Egyptian Cult of the Dragon. Undoubtedly Dracula assumed erroneously that he had received this ancientmystical honour during his investiture into Sigismund’s Societas Draconis, andby virtue of Sigismund’s supposed descent from Melusine and the ancient AngevinHouse of Vere. In his own right, Dracula can claim no relationship to any earlyAngevins, nor to the later second Anjou House of Plantagenet, except via aneight link marital bridge which has no alliances that relate him by blood toAnjou. Sigismund assumed a personal entitlement to this legacy in 1397, the date uponwhich he sought to reconstitute Princess Melusine’s Dragon Court—as SocietasDraconis—in a manner that he deemed the most suitable to enhance his power baseand establish his royal claims. Following its subsequent formal inception in1408, the Court recruited members from a number of prominent royal and noblehouses. Historians have noted that these were not particularly known for theirreligious orthodoxy, including the later House of Vere in England, as oneauthority on Sigismund’s Dragon Court has asserted. Today, however, the Imperial and Royal Dragon Court itself exists as a closedfraternity, a collective of individuals, comprising those who, unlike Sigismund,can trace their ancestry and affiliations back to the ancient, preChristianElven, Grail and Dragon families via Anjou. The Court retains the traditionalthree tier degree system that Sigismund borrowed and to which he appended threeseparate representations of the alchemical Ouroboros emblem for the distinctranks of the Court. A fourth emblem, configured in the form of the Egyptian Ankhor Albigensian Cross, was used by the family officers of the Inner Temple. The tripartite system was peculiar to the Scythians and Celts, whose Druidsincorporated a similar structure within their orders and colleges. It laterfound expression within the Cathar fraternity of Languedoc and also with theWitches. It was developed within the Hierarchical Rule of the Knights Templarwith whom the Court had a strong historical connection. Blood RelationshipThe Inner Temple is presided over by the Vere Grand Masters, who are currentlyresident in Britain and Europe. Being essentially an organisation whichemphasises the crucial links between Dragon families, the rank system within theCourt takes second place to the sense of blood relationship and the natural bondof co-operation engendered by that relationship. Service, mutual support andrespect supersede those types of ambition and advancement which prevail in otherbodies which might, on the face of it, resemble the Dragon Court model in someways. Within such orders, sights are firmly set towards material gain throughsupporting establishments which themselves breed division and inequity. The tenets of the Grail and Dragon traditions are implicit in defining that weshould be at one with the earth, and cannot, therefore, presume dominion overit. Unlike those who wish to profit unjustifiably from dubious Merovingiandescent. This philosophy is embedded in the concept of individual gnosis, and lies at thevery heart of the Draconian culture. It is evident in all aspects of lifeitself. Emanating from the ancient lore of the Elven Lords and Ladies of theForest, this ancestral legacy forms the bedrock upon which this and alllegitimately related Dragon Courts were originally founded. The Tinker KingsIt is no secret that, through a process of calculated indoctrination, ourindividual decisions are often prompted by fears of non-conformity orinsecurity. As a result we are conditioned to purchase a variety of hyped goodsand services in order to redress personal inadequacies that do not, in fact,exist. In reality, the prevalent forms of fear-based merchandising are littledifferent from straightforward protection rackets, and yet they are sanctionedand encouraged by our governing establishments. For centuries, western state authorities and their Churches have enjoyedcontinued power over a subordinate majority, by presenting a facade ofsacrosanct jurisdiction which has seemed inextricably linked to some form ofroyalty, nobility, or government by divine sanction. By virtue of this, it isnot surprising that so many people now consider royalty, nobility and westernreligion to be archaic components of a system of class and privilege which hasno place in the modern age. What few recognise, however, is that for centuries the perceived representationof royalty and nobility has, to a large extent, been a fraud perpetuated by adressed up merchant class elite who have no real entitlement to their positions.This farce, with its inherent tyranny and social abuse, has been endured throughthe ages, while the true bloodline families have been suppressed and supplantedby traders and brokers disguised in crowns and mitres. In practice, there is nothing noble about these tinker kings, since the word“noble” relates to gnosis or wisdom. However, they have long been defined as“aristocrats” (meaning “best rulers”), and have thereby retained gratuitousstations of power and influence in a self proclaimed higher echelon of society. These tinker kings and their emissaries have plagued the western scene forgenerations, leaving all to wonder how it is that our supposed guardians andambassadors are so often an embarrassment, and are rarely representative ofcommunity requirement. They refer to all and sundry as “subjects”, “commoners” and “flocks” using suchpatronising terminology as “the ordinary people” or “the man in the street”, asif they had some predestined right of supremacy. In reality, the fact is thatthe individual establishments of these said aristocrats (be they state heads,provincial overlords or clerical governors) are frequently very questionable,and their personal roots are often more ordinary than most. Mother EarthPrior to these distortions, the nature of kingship was entirely different. Therewas no requirement for Church sanction through coronation by parvenu popes orarchbishops. Kingship was founded upon the ideal that all people were adherentsof the earth, and that the earth bestowed sovereignty upon its first bornpeople, the Elven Tribes. They were represented by a Dragon Queen, and sheempowered the Grail King, who could not be a king without her. In this environment, the right to kingship emanated from the female, sinceMother Earth was herself deemed to be female. The overriding function of a kingand queen was to maintain a spiritually transcendent intelligence within therealm, thereby enabling the organism (the kingdom) to function and develop insymbiosis with its surrounding environment. If a change of governmental practice is deemed necessary, then there is nothingto gain by swapping the merchant class nobles for lawyer class presidents. Thereis, however, much to be gained by considering the advantages of properly definedGrail kingship and the Messianic code of princely service within a sociallyorientated constitutional framework. This is the most logical route towards ensuring that true democracy prevails for“Democracy” and is correctly defined as “Government for the people by thepeople”, as opposed to the all too familiar and oppressive “Government of thepeople”. Opportunists and OratorsAs a result of a general disenchantment, many now suggest that royalty andnobility should be marginalized in favour of republican style government. Somedetermine that such changes replace privilege with a more acceptable form ofmerit advantage. However, this perception is equally untenable in practice. All that happens is that headstrong merchant class opportunists are replaced bypolished lawyer class orators, thereby creating an unwarranted new elite, withthe same destructive hold on society. Government of the majority by an exclusive clique, which uses intimidatingtactics to manipulate a consumer based economy, has nothing whatever to do withthe time honoured spirit of Grail kingship and the Dragon blood. Any shift frommonarchy to republicanism is simply a matter of different packaging. In theevent, we are still captive consumers enveloped within faiths of fear. Ourlegacy from all this is an inbred contempt for anything which does not conformto a system of venerated sale values. This leads to the loss of our relationshipwith the ecosphere upon which all species truly depend. The GrailThe practical application of the Grail Code of service and guardianship wasgeared to the hermetic principle, “As above, so below”. It recognised that nosane mind would, for the sake of short-term profit, disenfranchise the body uponwhich it depends. From medieval times, however, this is precisely what has happened, with theChurch installing dealers and merchants as puppet kings, traders who had noknowledge of kingship, but who have spawned dynasties which, in turn, haveappointed their own colleagues as hereditary puppet nobles. The Church and its appointees (be they monarchs, bishops or pseudo nobles) haveproclaimed the Messianic legacy to be heresy. By doing this they haveunderwritten and promulgated tyrannical systems of elitism, separatism andenvironmental domination to the detriment of the many. Out of EgyptThe Dragon Court can first be identified in Egypt under the patronage of thepriest prince Ankhfn Khonsu in about 2170 BC. It was subsequently establishedmore formally as a pharaonic institution by the twelfth dynasty Queen SobekhNefru (c.1785 BC). The Court pursued the teachings of Thoth, which had prevailed from the time ofNimrod's grandson King Raneb, a pharaoh of the second dynasty. He reigned c.2852 BC, about three centuries before the Gizeh pyramids are considered to havebeen built. In those far off times, the priests and temples were not associated withreligion as were their later successors in other lands, but rather more with theduties of preserving and teaching the old wisdom. The temples incorporatedal-khame workshops. It was the obligation of the priests to maintain thespiritual welfare of the pharaohs, while ensuring the purity of a continuingroyal bloodline which progressed through the Dragon Queens of the matrilinearGrail succession. Dragon sovereignty had evolved in Egypt from old Mesopotamia and its traditionwas vested in Sobek, the sacred crocodile (the messeh or mus-hus). It was fromthe practice of kingly anointing with the fat of the messeh that the Hebrew verb“mashiach” (to anoint) derived, and the Dragon dynasts became known as Messiahs(anointed ones). In 525 BC Egypt was conquered by the Persians, whose kings were subsequentlyousted by Alexander the Great's Macedonian army in 332 BC. This led to the Greekdynasty of the Ptolemies and the well-known Queen Cleopatra VII. Her liaisonwith the Roman general Mark Antony caused the final downfall of the pharaohs,and Egypt was subjugated by Imperial Rome shortly before the time of Jesus. Atlength, as the Roman Empire collapsed, Egypt fell to Byzantine governors andthen, after AD 641, to the sway of Islam. The PenDragonsBy that time, the Grail Dynasty from David and Solomon had progressed into theWest, notably to the Merovingian kings of Gaul, while related branchesestablished kingdoms in Ireland and Celtic Britain. These lines were linkedthrough marriage to parallel Dragon strains from Ham, Japhet and Tubal Cain(which had survived as the royal houses of Scythia and Anatolia). The familieshad forged their own marital links with the early princesses of the Egyptiansuccession. The first PenDragon (Head Dragon) of the Britannic Isle (Pen Draco Insularis).From this stock was King Cymbeline of the House of Camu, who was installed inabout AD 10. The Celtic PenDragons were not father to son successors in aparticular descent, but were individually elected from reigning family branches,by a Druidic council of elders, to be the overall Kings of Kings. The lastPenDragon was Cadwaladr of Gwynedd, who died in AD664. At around that time much of Britain fell to the Germanic influence of theinvading Anglo Saxons and Angle land (England) was born, as distinct fromScotland and Wales. This coincided with Byzantium's loss of Egypt to the Caliphs and following thelast Roman Emperor in AD 476, a completely new governmental structure evolved inthe West. Its ultimate overlords were the Popes, and outside the preservedCeltic domains they appointed kings not by any right of heritage, but to suitthe political motives of the bishops and the fast growing Roman Church. Itappeared that the days of the Dragon heritage were over. However, the truedynasts of the original Grail stock always upheld their positions and the spiritof the Dragon Court continued in influential circles throughout Europe and theNear East. The Dragon and the GrailAs the generations passed, the ideal of dynastic kingship spread through theMediterranean lands into the Balkans, the Black Sea regions and Europe. But, inthe course of this, the crucial essence of the old wisdom was lost, and thisgave rise to dynasties that were not of the true kingly race. Instead, many wereunrelated warrior chiefs who gained their thrones by might of the sword. The sacred culture of the ancients was, nevertheless, retained in the Messianicline of King David of Judah (c.1008 BC), whose significance was not in hisgenerally portrayed descent from Abraham and the Shemite strain, but in hisPharaonic heritage. It was through this particular Dragon inheritance that Solomon the Wise, someeight centuries after Queen Sobeknefru, was enabled to recreate the Royal Templeproject in Jerusalem. This led to a Holy Land revival of the pharaonic RosiCrucis (dew cup) movement at a time when Egypt was beset by foreign influences,first from Libya, Nubia and Kush, and then from further afield. As a result, the traditional marriage arrangements of the pharaohs andprincesses gave way to diplomatic alliances. The symbol of the Rosi Crucis hadidentified the Grail succession from beyond 3000 BC, and its graphicrepresentation was a red cross within a circle. Societas DraconisIn 1408 (when Britain was in her Plantagenet era), the Dragon Court was formallyreconstituted as a sovereign body at a time of wars and general politicalturmoil. As we have seen, the Court's dubious re-emergence was instigated bySigismund von Luxembourg, King of Hungary. Having presumptuously and erroneouslyassumed to have inherited the bloodline legacy in 1397, he drew up a pact withtwenty-three royals and nobles who swore to observe “true and pure fraternity”within the Societas Draconis, a style subsequently misidentified as the OrdoDraconis (Hungarian: Sarkany Rend). Although the original Court was by no means an Order in the recognised chivalricsense, the misnomer was strategically retained for the purposes ofidentification. Along with Sigismund and the twenty-three nobles, Sigismund's second wife,Barbara Cille (daughter of the Austrian Duke Hermann of Styria), was jointsovereign. Barbara was a Vampire who was taught by Ibrahim Eleazar, the keeperof the Sacred Magic of Abramelin the Mage, and it is she who is the model forthe beautiful Countess Carmilla Karnstein in le Fanu’s novel of the same name. Sigismund’s daughter Elizabeth was also a member of the Court, and the inclusionof the entire family thereby achieved the traditional overall standard of twentysix members or two magical circles of thirteen. Others prominent in the SocietasDraconis were the Kings of Polandand Aragon, the Duke of Lithuania and theunrepentant heretic, the Duke of Split. The founding document of the Court confirmed that members might wear theinsignia of a Dragon incurved into a circle, with a red cross, the originalemblem of the Rosi Crucis, which had identified the Grail succession from before3000 BC. Members were required to wear black attire on Friday—the day ruled byVenus—and to all intents and purposes they were to hold property in common. The Society had no patron saint, it had no chapel or chapter house and observedno feast or holy days. Members were expected to have been ennobled prior toentry and were only elevated within the Society in recognition of theircontributions to the welfare of the Crown. Sigismund never knighted anyone intothe Society. This ignored completely all the expected rituals and affectationsof chivalry prevalent at the time. At least the Luxemburgundian got that right. Imperial Status Shortly after this foundation, Sigismund was crowned Holy Roman Emperor and, asa result, the noble fraternity achieved a heightened status as an imperialedifice. Although the Court's ancient origins were steeped in pre Christianlore, Pope Eugene IV was obliged to approve his Emperor's non Catholicestablishment, for the nature of the Dragon, even if you fake it, is such thatits kingly tradition surmounts the mundane constraints of denominationaldispute. After all, King David, Solomon and even Jesus were all preChristiandynasts of the line. There were, of course, those staunch upholders of the Church's articles of dogmawho openly opposed the pre papal concept of Grail kingship. These bishops pronounced the Arthurian romances heretical and blacklisted thewritings of Merlin in 1546 at the Council of Trento in northern Italy.Everything that was magic to the ears, and all that was fresh air to thesubjugated, became denounced as sinister and occult. The great enlightenment of the “Grail Code” of service was condemned in a seriesof brutal Inquisitions from 1203, and anything remotely connected with thefemale Draconian ethic was justifiably dubbed Witchcraft. The following series of essays, which could be alternatively titled The Historyof the Dragon Peoples, are extracted from archival and research material. Theauthor derives its contemporary synthesis from a 30 to 40-year period ofscholarship, teaching, revelation, and ceremony. The following collection ofstudies reflects the nature of the author's final conclusions in 1993 and at thetime of publication in 2004, respectively. This is the first book in a series of works covering the history of the ElvenTribes and the Dragon Tradition. Further works, due to be published hereshortly, will include archaeological and historical studies of the DerkesthaiCulture from 10,000 BC onwards, further material from the Dragon Archives, anongoing series of novels and a series of scientific papers. The ethos of the Dragon Culture encourages an intelligent, but above all aruthlessly honest appreciation of the matters presented. We hope that this mayexpose the establishment’s historical fabrications and deceptions throughouthistory which have harmed society immeasurably. We want to change the attitudesof the many who have been manipulated for the gain of a few for over onethousand years. "},{"pageContent":"PART ONE Foreword Although it may appear elitist, when the old families observe that the Dragonsare being misrepresented to the extent that everybody wants to become one, thetime-honoured consensus of feeling among them is compounded. They see that itinevitably leads to a gap in the market being filled, resulting in yet anotherimpudent impertinence being perpetrated. A good example of this is the detritusof Gerald Gardner which he presented in the1950s as the “definitive” and “original” expression of the “Old Religion”.Inauthentic Witchcraft emerged in the 1950's, principally at the instigation ofthis retired clerk in the Indian Raj named Gerald Gardner. It is from thisparticular source that the ridiculous notion of Witchcraft being primarily afertility cult gained its credence. He sanitised what little he knew about Witches with exactly the same pecuniary,sexual or social motives that his descendants use for peddling their equallyuseless rubbish today. One can't “initiate” into the old blood or teach the oldways to the “mahoum”. It is a pointless and fruitless waste of time that doesn'twork. They inevitably get the wrong idea and discard its most valuable tenets.Alternatively, they add to that history or knowledge their own misconceptionswhich then become carved in stone and published in faddist popular books as thesacred wisdom of a faddist culture. Naturally it would be appreciated if people identified sympathetically with thecharacters in the Dragon tradition, but not to the extent where every readerthinks that they are one, or can aspire to be one. Most of them could never be. The courses or “initiations” which are on offerfrom the exploiters of the “New Age” money machine are sanitised to obliteratewhat could be termed a “dark” and hence possibly “evil” tradition. Suchexercises will also inevitably lead to the discredit of the Dragon ethos. Whensuch courses or “initiations” are found not to work, it is because the majorityof participants either won't have the right blood serum or the right connectionsin their cerebral lobes. We live in a world in which all people are encouraged to think of themselves(somewhat hypocritically given the way they treat each other); in homogenous,egalitarian terms. Therefore the foregoing statement is tantamount to heresy. Itis unacceptable in ordinary society to suggest that people are not equal orphysiologically and anatomically the same. But nevertheless they are not. One might counter such an unreasonably deluded and elitist sounding statement byarguing that because of the out-breeding of the old families, there must bemillions of people “of the Fairy blood” living today. However such a statementflies in the face of the following accepted historical facts: a) The genuine old royal families rarely outbred at all, whilst the later, fakeparvenu, tinker nobility with whom people now confuse them often did; b) Most of the Scythian, Royal-Druidic, Fairy population in Britain and Europewas wiped out by the Romans in the Battles at Mona and at other Druidic sites; c) The Celts (and what was left of the Scythian Fairy Families who served astheir lords and protectors) were decimated by bubonic plague, starvation and theSaxon invasions in the 6th century. Following this, in Britain and continentalEurasia, the Church and the rats spent another three or four hundred years,during the medieval and Reformation periods, dispatching the survivors of theprevious epidemics, famines, wars or persecutions. d) That the Aryan Scythian Overlords—the Fairy High Kings and Queens—maintaineda caste system that, although eventually became corrupt and overrun by thewarrior caste, was arguably still in place (as the European Class System) untilthe Second World War. Even up until the First World War the manorialrestrictions on the movements of rural labourers, other than during holidays,were still enforced and thus unhindered mobility, either geographically orwithin the class system itself, was extremely rare. Throughout the period preceding the modification of the Witchcraft laws (nowcalled “The Fraudulent Mediums’ Act”) the remnant of the Scythian, sacral-royaloverlords who were left were destroyed by papal decree. In the meantime, in Britain, in addition to the persecutions, many of thewealthier and more powerful overlords whose families had survived up to thatpoint were killed off and/or replaced in both lands and name, by thosemerchant-class new tinker families. They, in turn, paid the corrupt ersatzroyalty of the Tudor and Stewart Houses enough money for the titles and estates. Following this sequence of events Oliver Cromwell continued the good work andmassacred the nobility and allowed their estates to be usurped by even moremembers of the merchant-class. Considering the sum of this state of affairs, it is extremely unlikely that anyof the people in those classes whose descendants now patronise the “New Age”fads would have made contact with or intermarried with what was left of the pureElven Blood-Royal. Therefore to say perhaps that it doesn't matter whether a fewmercenary fly-by-nights open up preposterous courses, making ludicrous, falseclaims to be able to train and initiate “probationary Elves” or “grail maidens”,is a denial of what the Fairy blood and the teachings are all about. The descent and the doctrine of the Elven Families are based upon truth andhonour. The comparison shows in sharp relief to what extent people today havealready been betrayed enough over the centuries by their own kind. If one presents people with the Dragon history in an over attractive candysweetwrapping or in such a manner as to make it seem as if anyone can belong to it,then one becomes a deceiver oneself. This would lay others open to psychologicalabuse, financial exploitation and manipulation at the hands of the “New AgeMoney Vampires”, thereby adding yet another element to the mass psychologicalignorance and confusion over identity that already contributes to so much socialdisquiet and unrest. Unscrupulous advertising executives, politicians and manufacturers lead peopleto believe that they can be whoever they want to be and achieve anything theywant to achieve. The only conditions are that they have enough money and workhard enough for the establishment's corporate elites. The object is to producemore efficient consumer-producers. Class barriers have been relaxed only slightly for a couple of generations. Itis likely that the vast majority of those who would like to prop up their egosand empower themselves (in a world that only encourages such in the financialsense) by becoming Elven Magicians, Grail Maidens or Vampire Overlords are goingto be in for a big disappointment. It's no use saying that people don't thinklike that because they do. Literally thousands of people in Britain and America have the impudence to callthemselves Witches. Hundreds more join “magical orders” or associations.Thousands more annually sign up for mystical, “New Age” workshops in a plethoraof inappropriate foreign disciplines unsuited to their cultural backgrounds. Itcan be guaranteed that none of them were ever asked about their family historywhich, after all, from an endocrinal point of view, is the most importantcriterion. People don't realise that they have only just emerged from a social system whichwas corruptly used by the Church-State for centuries to engineer them intohaving specific brain physiologies which are not suitable for application toDragon Subjects. If they were, then the majority of people would havetranscended naturally by now anyway and the world would be an entirely differentplace. They haven't, they can't, it isn't, and under the present circumstances, itnever will be. Even if society were to interbreed more with the Dragon Familiesthat are left—if there are any at all—then the Dragon DNA would eventuallybecome weaker. In this case the Dragon ability would then be lost, leaving uswith exactly the same social result anyway. The modern idea that potentially anyone can be “initiated” either as a Witch ora Druid is pretentious and arrogant. It has been, it is said, (in privatelycirculated Witchcraft documents*), a source of offence to many ancient familiesfor over half a century. Unless a full, genuine, known pedigree can be produced, demonstrating anunbroken line of descent from a royal, Archdruidic family, no modern aspirant orso-called priest or priestess has the right either to call themselves a Witch ora Druid. The same applies to those who would call themselves “Aryans”. The modern concept of “initiation into Witchcraft” is an insult to those whosefamilies, over the period of the Thousand Year Elven Holocaust, died at thehands of the Church. Like Elven royalty and nobility, to which Druidism andWitchcraft are inextricably linked, both are aspects of the High Aryan Mana, themystical maja or maia, the genetic memory of a unique race that is carried inthe blood. This cannot be bestowed by any form of nonsensical neo-pagannonsense. The Royal Windsor Coven and many others, reputedly old hereditary family groups,were the custodians of traditions which had, by their own admission, little ornothing in common with the modern neo-pagan revivalist movement or itsreconstructed rituals. The latter had been invented by Gerald Gardner andrevised by Sanders and other “initiates”. These gentlemen, The Marshmallow Papers related, were, along with Crowley,rebuffed by Pickingill or by other covens that descended from those East Angliansepts which themselves descended from either the historical British covens orthe Flemish weavers. Here it must be noted that Aleister Crowley was actuallyinterested in Witchcraft. Isn't that a surprise? Considering the fact that hisgeneration of “magicians” usually tended to repudiate it. Or did they? Undoubtedly many “magicians” have justifiably poured scorn on modern Wicca butnevertheless, it still remains a recorded fact that Crowley attempted to joinGeorge Pickingill's group. Furthermore, one of Crowley's close associates,Austin Osman Spare, was involved in Witchcraft himself. We can perhaps see fromSpare's work, The Anathema of Zos, why Crowley was so interested in Pickingill'spre-revivalist doctrine of the “Craft of the Wise”. *During the late 1970's and early 1980's a series of privately published paperswere circulated which contained material that originated from old NorthernCovens and the “Royal Windsor Coven”. One in particular—The MarshmallowPapers—contained a damning criticism of so-called Gardnerian and Alexandrian“initiatory” Witchcraft. This was followed by criticisms made to this authorthat stemmed from the leaders of the Baphometic Orders in London and the BlackCountry, who emphatically asserted that the only genuine form of validWitchcraft was passed down through the blood. In Spare's essay on traditional Witchcraft, or at least by his time, a latecorrupted form of it, he describes it as an ecstatic, transcendent philosophy.He was familiar with, and variously employed, the strategies anciently used inso-called “high magic” to encourage the body to transport itself into statesthat were old territory for the Magi and the Druids, the Maenads and theBacchantes. Spare's account clearly demonstrates that Witchcraft had Tantric elements andwas, like Crowley's system of “Magick”, in the business of making “Ubaids” or“Overseers”. This is poles apart from Gerald Gardner’s mediafriendly product ofmodern Wicca. In examining Spare's work, we might learn why Crowley was so interested inPickingill and then be tempted to ask where the Africans got Vodun or Voodoo, asit is known to us. “New Age” paganism or Wicca repackages old hypocritical Christian moral valuesand symbols, and attaches products, services and books of no value whatsoever.These are promoted and marketed by business people whose only interest is inbuilding up a captive client base of weak-minded individuals who are programmedto buy the next “soul-saving” product from them. Soon “Les idiotes dans la queste pour la verité” discover that the lastphilosophical tin of beans or cheap crystal they bought from the High Gurus ofthe “New Age” does not work. Then these peddlars of kitsch “truth” tell themthat their karma is wrong, or they “don't believe” it enough, or that they havea hostile attitude or lack of focus or some such excuse. This deflects the blame from them and lays it firmly at the door of the lucklesspunter—following which they then recommend that the sap buy from one of these“Irreproachable Wise Ones” yet another Mystery of the Ancients (“at only$29.99”) which will undoubtedly work this time. And it never does and so they go back for another try. Real magic is at workhere. A group of secretly initiated individuals are turning dross into gold.Fools give charlatans good money in exchange for utterly useless rubbish. Nowthat's alchemy! The papers originating from the northern covens clearly revealed that Witchcraftprior to the Wiccan revival of the 1950's bore no resemblance to what passes forformulaic Witchcraft now, and was not pagan, fertility based or necessarilyGoddess-led. Essentially it was and is the same as the Witchcraft sponsored bythe Baphometic Orders who trace their lineage back through the Templars toJesus' original teachings and the culture of the Druids. The nearest approximation or identification in this particular instance would bebetween late 19th-century Northern British ritual and the French medieval,Cathar-sponsored Witch movement. In both these instances the central figure wasthe Baphomet and the highest sacrament of the “Sabbat” was the Black Mass. Thishad nothing to do with Satanism, which in itself, was and is a late, halfunderstood non sequitur—manufactured by the Roman Church—that has nothing to dowith the Dragon tradition. Many so-called aficionados of the Occult, and especially those who like to callthemselves Witches in public, maintain that “The Black Mass was Satanic”. Theygo on to say that white Witchcraft or Wiccecraeft—as they like to call it—“hasnothing to do with Satanism and the Black Mass, which are a parody ofCatholicism and the Catholic Mass”. They squawk—off pat and by rote—like trainedparrots, whilst the Church Fathers grin gleefully when they see how well theirpropaganda has taken root. The Wiccans' or neo-pagans' agenda here is to try and convince as many people asthey can that they are mysterious and somehow superior to others withoutactually saying as much. They themselves think—and would like other people tothink—that they belong to an ancient tradition or fraternity with knowledge towhich the public isn't party. They want to impress upon people further—beforethose people are tempted to start throwing big bricks through witchywindows—that Witches are really nice people and that true “Wiccans”—(whilststill trading off the dark and slightly dangerous allure evoked by the wordWitch)—deal solely with “white” magic. In this way the attention seekers hope to become more popular or respected bybeing surrounded by some aura of mystique that they consider in their own mindsto be “cool”. They've seen Witches on television no doubt. They believe that byjumping on the bandwagon and choosing that particular persona, out of the manythat are on offer at a price, it will make people think they are special andhence attractive. The big stumbling block here is that Royal Witchcraft, or Witchcraft proper,from the early Dark Ages onwards owes as much to its clearly Christian, as itdoes to its direct Druidic, origins. Both in their original form, in thepublicly disseminated opinion of the Catholic popes, were and are Satanic.Jesus' heredity—and the descent of the Druidic dynasties—both derived from anidentical Dragon nascence that the Roman Catholics decided was devilish, becausethe descent of both bloodlines was from the Sumerian Enki who was the AkkadianSamael: the Roman Lucifer and thus the Catholic Satan. In Jesus' case the Roman Church, as do all outsiders who know they are on to agood thing, sanitised his rituals and concealed his descent. All those whocontinued to follow Jesus' original teachings—like the Witches—they burned as“heretics”. This notwithstanding, the Wiccan apologists still try to tell usthat Witchcraft has nothing to do with Christianity but is a preChristianfertility religion. However, the word “heretic” was only used by the Inquisitors to specificallydefine those heterodox Christian beliefs which were at variance with the RomanChurch's orthodox teachings. To call a Witch a heretic meant that the Witch wasa heterodox Christian. The Inquisitors—whatever we may think of them—werenobody's fools. They were aware of whom they were targeting. They also knew that Witches were“original Christians” whose knowledge of the true, Druidic nature of Jesus'liberating Christianity had to be quashed at any cost if the Church were toachieve the political and pecuniary supremacy they desired by replacing it withtheir own enslaving dogma. All the time Witches existed, they were a testament to the fact that RomanCatholicism was nothing like Christianity, and was nothing more than a pack ofusurping lies made fragrant with the incense of the suffering of the Dragons,whom the Roman Church had murdered in their pursuit of ultimate world power. The author has had first-hand experience of what happens when outsiders, eitheras “media commentators” or as “supporters”, become involved with the traditionsof the old families. It doesn't take long before both types start to demand thatthe tradition be adjusted to meet the middle class expectations of a purchasingpublic that has been fed on sanitised, smug “New Age” moral crapulence. This isso that they, either the commentators or supporters, can attract even moreadherents or readers and thereby increase their envisaged profit margins. After a while, in order to ensure maximum profits, the outsiders set abouttrying to silence and marginalize the very people who were born into thattradition and upon whom they formerly depended for their wisdom and knowledge.This is just in case the now somewhat bemused custodians of the blood “dosomething out of keeping with what WE are trying to achieve”. As Mr. Kenneth Grant, O. T. O., has pointed out, money and Magick don't mix. Theauthor echoes this sentiment when he states emphatically that the Dragon Courtis a closed body which is kept sacrosanct for members of the blood; and is not apublic, profit-making organisation. As for the Black Mass that so-called New Age Wiccans disown, this ritual was nota “Christian parody born of frustration with, or rebellion against, the Churchof the day”—as they repeat faithfully from the formulae printed in theirbite-size tomes of “New Age” dogma. It was the original Christian Mass of Jesuswhich the Catholics later stole and sanitised for public consumption in the sameway that Wiccan apologists are doing withWitchcraft today. Anyone with average intelligence can interpret the Black Mass properly. Prior tothe attaching of the Church's “satanic” label during the medieval period—and itsdecadence and misuse by outsiders throughout the Renaissance andpost-Reformation eras—it was one of the most profound and poetic family ritualsever conceived. Its hermetic and alchemical symbolism delved deep into theKabala and High Magic. If so-called “Wiccans” in fact actually were real Witches, they would know this.But they don't and they're not. The hyperbole that they indulge in is no morethan a regurgitation of books written by equally misinformed writers who, overthe preceding decades, have managed to get their seriously flawed ideaspublished. Whether perceived from the point of view of either its Christian orits Druidic aspects, Royal Witchcraft was never devotional. So much forWitchcraft being a fertility religion. The Black Mass had its roots in the ancient alchemical lore of Solomon and wassimply a momento of teachings long past and an aide memoire for futuregenerations, a mnemonic which was intended to remind those to come from whencethe power and the wisdom derives. If the reader looks carefully at the Aziluth scales of the sephiroth of Binahthey will see what is meant. The Sabbatical Goat of the Black Mass wasChem-Zoroaster, one of the early ancestors of the ancient Dragon Families. Hissymbolic presence at the Mass reminds one that Royal Witchcraft was strictly afamily affair. Witches actually called their “god” the Antecessor, meaning “the ancestor”. Thisillustrated to later generations of readers that “Satan”, also called by theWitches “Christ, son Dei” or “Jesus Christ, son of God”, and was in fact a fleshand blood being. He was not a fallen angel invented by commercially-mindedCatholic priests. If the Witches of the Royal Covens honoured Jesus as an ancestor-god, then theymust have been Merovingian by descent and thus custodians of the Sang Royale.Here we enter in upon the realm of the Holy Grail. Royal Witches were Elven byblood and everybody contemporary to them knew this. Professor Murray made thisassertion in England and was followed by Jules Michelet in France who recordedthat the epithet “Fairy” was attributed by the French to the ancient GallicQueens. This also means that The Holy Grail itself was Elven as was Jesus himself,complete with his Crown of Fairy Thorns, depicted as the headgear of Godfroi deVere de Bouilllon in the 12th century. Throughout the generations, ignorantoutsiders have distorted the history of the ancient families and the ancientRoyal doctrine. The fact that most of humanity is engaged in activities based upon greed, andwhich are destroying their world is actually seen to be good. Those who disagreewith first, this modus operandi, and second, hold an historically differentperspective, are perceived as evil. New Age Wicca members perpetuate thislogical imbalance for their own nefarious, selfish ends. They have nothing to dowith Witchcraft, but everything to do with the selfish motivation of those whopromote a “white” Wicca for their own financial, social or sexual ends within asocial environment which is still morally conditioned by manipulative medievalprejudices. Modern Wicca, much like other aspects of the 21st century, is a cheap imitationof what has gone before. Thus it is little more than a fashion statement forthose who want to take part in the “born-again Christianity”. These views are due not to any particular bad experience with Wiccans or NewAgers – other, that is, than any experience with such people is likely to benegative. It is simply the conclusion reached after thirty years of activeinvolvement in the Dragon tradition. This has shown again and again that thosewho are attracted to the manufactured trappings of the so-called New Age andWicca, are social inadequates providing perfect bait for unscrupulouscharlatans. The British Trading Standards Office demands of the manufacturer or serviceprovider that any goods or services offered for sale by them should be “Fit tobe used for the purpose for which they were intended”. The New Age Movement,Wicca and indeed modern revivalist Christianity all fall below this definitionand furthermore, and therefore technically fall foul of the British TradesDescriptions Act. All—including Revivalist Christianity—should be investigated in these terms andalso in relation to the British Fraudulent Mediums’ Act. They will not be,because they make money. As far as the Security Services are concerned, they areimpotent and harmless. Besides, they keep the consumers quiet in theirsemi-detached cages. To the sociologists who advise governments we have become categorised into“numbered social units”; to those governments' military tacticians we are“expendable civilian collateral assets” and to the tradesmen who control thosegovernments we are “consumers”. Do we wish to continue to be labelled socynically, and only according to our relative value to any given elite or itsagents? -The inverted pyramid of diminishing human value “Expendable Civilian CollateralAsset” “Numbered Social Unit”“The Consumer” “Pawn”“0” If the planet is to survive, social groups must become smaller and ordered byeconomic necessity, not by the so-called Democracy of Consumerism, championed,anything but “free” West. People learn by suffering and fundamental change comes through the stimulus ofradical pain. At present many people in the western world have not experiencedenough adversity to make them demand change. Any call for the adoption of sanesocial and environmental policies still sounds to them like the insane rantingsof isolated idealists. Social Alternatives?The Dragon Court exists as an organisation solely for the bloodline descendantsof the ancient Vere family—the senior bloodline successors of theScythian-Merovingian, Elven House of Princess Maelasanu—and for those whosebloodlines are extracted from this descent and its ancient Dragon Court. Such is the nature of its enforced exclusivity that the Dragon Sovereignty hasbecome the only sovereign body in existence today that demands a DNA test as aprerequisite of membership. The reason is that being a Dragon is and always wasa matter of race and never a matter of “lifestyle choice”, regardless of marketpotentials. Being of the Dragon Blood is exactly like being a member of the AmerindianPequat Tribe which, like the Court, also demands such rigorous proofs ofaboriginality. After a thousand years of persecution would anyone dare accuse usof racism? We are fighting for our racial identity to be restored to us and inthis we are no different to the Jews or the American Indians or any other Tribeor Nation which has suffered at the hands of the European Church-State. Do we accuse them of racism or conversely, do we approve of their efforts inattempting to restore and cultivate their cultural distinctness and uniqueness?Like the Indians, the Dragons are also sick of having their culture adopted anddiluted by the very races and nations that spent so much time and effort tryingto eradicate them and other indigenous populations from both the face of theearth and the pages of the history books. Nevertheless, the Dragons are committed to furthering the cause of socialequity. And whilst desirous of promoting spiritual and scientific education tothose who genuinely seek change, ultimately the Dragons' concerns lay in therestoration of their own Tribes, their own Nation and their own Homelands. Ultimately and unequivocally the Dragons have a love for truth and strive tore-establish their own tuadhe based on veracity, honour, liberty and social andenvironmental equity, according to the Dragons’ ancient lore. They don't want to wedge their toes in your doors and they don't want to preachtheir truth at you. They certainly don't want to “convert” you! Instead they are working towards the re-foundation of their own distinctsociety, utilising the sovereign national rights that the ancient Imperial andRoyal Dragon Sovereignty historically already has. By re-introducing their oldsocial structures and values the Dragons hope to establish a naturally ordainedsystem of socio-economic interactions between the Dragon people, based onclarity of vision, honesty of spirit and material necessity. By avoiding greed and concentrating upon a far richer spiritual and culturalexperience derived from the ancient racial memory of the Dragon, it is envisagedthat its society will be governed by innate conviction. Achieved through teaching the timeless psychological skills that facilitateaccess to this infinite realm, it is hoped that the community might continue asan example of what real “royalty” entails. Furthermore it will demonstrate howcommunities can work fairly and efficiently, with a hundred-fold increase incultural quality, spiritual significance and personal empowerment. This dependsupon them being based not on idealism, materialism or patriotism, but on sound,realistic principles which are structured organically, according to theoutworking of the Draconian consciousness. The Dragons have no interest in politics and no desire to “Rule the Planet” ascertain named fools have suggested. Not least because history teaches us that inpower-brokering terms, the “top dog” is in fact “the exposed duck” and inpolitical arenas it's duck season all year round. Egotism seeks power through rule, but the Dragons' transcendent perception, theDerkesthai or clear sight, is attained through relinquishing egotism. So Dragonscouldn't “rule” anyway, the two concepts would be mutually self-negating. The office of the ancient Druidic or Dragon Queen or King was that of a Magus(hence majesty), Seer and Guide. The idea of a King as “ruler” or even themodern President or Premier as “ruler”, is outdated warrior class nonsense, thedisastrous consequences of which can be witnessed across the entire planet.Ultimately we do not want to be chained to your hamster wheel. The wheel mightstill be turning, but the rodent has long since died and the carcass isbeginning to stink. In tune with the Dragon Court and the old covens, many other groups did not andstill do not initiate outsiders as new members but, echoing Merovingiantradition, only acknowledge family members who have reached a certain age. The overly complex and unnecessary initiation rites found in Wicca or modernWitchcraft were and are entirely absent from the rites of small hereditarygroups which practiced the old craft. If one knows one is a Witch because one isborn into a Witch family, one doesn't need excessive pomp and hocus-pocus toconvince one of the obvious. Similarly, it is unnecessary to wear the entiresilver standard of a small nation around one's corpulent neck in the form oftasteless pseudo-Wiccan or occult jewellery in order to reinforce the idea—tooneself and to others—that one is a “Witch”. The structure of the historical covens will be dealt with later. However, theDragon Court itself is not now and never was a “Coven” in the way that this wordis accepted today. When reading this book, this should be borne in mind. Recruitment in times of hardship did occur and “listeners” were expected todrink the blood of the Officiate. This classical, pre-Christian practice wasintended to act as a Eucharist where recruits would take on the nature of theLeader by infusing their own being with his or her genetic material. This form of pact lasted 7 years, the approximate time it takes for the body torenew its cells entirely. After 7 years the recruit would have to drink theblood again as none of the Leader's essence would remain with them after theircellular regeneration. In this way they were made footsoldiers. However, it wasn't an “initiation” orfor life, as modern “Wiccans” have perceived induction to be. Anyway it isdoubtful whether they would agree to a Vampiric ritual being included into theirrepertoire, as it might damage their respectable image as “white Witches”,whatever that is supposed to mean: beyond being misinformed, fraudulentpretenders. This is not elitism. For centuries the ancestors of today's would-be Witches,magicians and New-Age gurus raped, tortured, burned and hanged the Elven people.Now they take their names, their titles and their culture and use it to enhancetheir own social kudos, when they cannot even prove that they are of the Dragonblood. In the GenesHaving said that, anyone who genuinely believes they have the right to beacknowledged as a “Draconian”, a member of the ancient Elven, Dragon race, iswelcome to submit a genealogy which devolves back to either the Scythian orMittani Royal Houses before the time of Christ. That is at least 80 generations. Unlike self-styled gurus, the Dragon Court, therefore, always seeks to supportits claims with substantial, scientific evidence. We have been brought up in a scientific age where we are conditioned to demandand accept scientific proofs as the benchmark of validity for any conceptpresented to us. This is no bad thing and the Dragons themselves have maintainedthis attitude for centuries. Indeed, such an approach is at the foundation ofsome of the most poetic and romantic tales in the Dragon culture which, at theirheart, reveal themselves as pure science. The interaction between mind and brain can be psychosomatically suppressed orenhanced by belief. If people are presented with scientific proof of theexistence of Dragon genes in their own blood, the abilities which accompanythose genes and their genetic memory will become accessible in a strange kind ofconsensual way. Once they believe that it is “acceptable” to believe what theyfeared society would condemn as fanciful, they are free. They also experience apreviously unperceived sense of clarity. When they do, they will see that most of human endeavour is pointless. They willsee a cleaner way to live life and will find that a common, natural socialmorality will accompany their every waking thought. They will have need for neither man's petty laws nor authorities and masters.The innate laws of life will arise from within accompanied by a love of truthand a contempt for falsehood, pretence and deceit. They will allow themselves tobecome what they already were and what the corporate elites fearmost—integrated, transcendent, detached, truly intelligent and creative beings:Overlords unto themselves—the members of a separate race—a “Royal Priesthood, aPeculiar People and a Holy Nation”. Mere belief is what fuels mere religion. From absolute proof however, there isderived absolute certainty in one's condition and one's heritage. Quietlybelieving or hoping to oneself that one is of the Dragon Race is one thing. Inmost cases the belief, when it wavers, causes numerous blockages to thefulfilment of any potential as the negative spiral circles downwards with everywaver and every failed attempt. “You shall know the truth, and the truth shall set you free.” Knowing beyond any doubt, however, that one is of that Blood opens wide thedoors to the infinite. The planet needs its Elves back, so the saying goes. Itneeds the people for whom order and empathy come instinctively. It needs thosewhose love of the natural world comes before all else and arises spontaneouslyfrom the depths of their eternal souls. Above all the planet needs its firstbornto know who they are themselves. It should be said that the symbolism throughout the entire book is not part ofsome occult, mystical philosophy. If it appears mystical now, it is because wecredit our ancestors with little intelligence or knowledge. Experts say thattechnology, and hence man's understanding, was primitive, regardless of the factthat the Greeks discovered the atom and understood the basics of jet propulsion,whilst the Kabalists were amongst the first mystics to present the “Big Bang”theory. We believe that they couldn't have known about endocrinology or psychobiology.We view their obscure writings and symbols as primitive scribbles. We are notencouraged to relate it to a scientific basis because our culture dissuades usfrom attributing such to these predecessors. Nevertheless, if you strip away the deliberately planted establishmentcombinations of superstition, fear and devil worship engendered by centuries ofRoman Catholic hatred and envy, you will find that the Dragon people weren't“Occultists” but scientists. This is the most threatening aspect of theirculture as far as the Church is concerned. Dragon philosophy is based ontangible assays whilst Catholic dogma is based on manipulated nonsense, thephilosophy of which is totally ungrounded and illogical. The logic of Dragonscience was the threat. In any case the Church's priesthood was neither of theblood nor privy to it, and therefore not in control of these secrets. Even ifthey could understand them, they were unable to utilise them for the followingreasons. As discussed, Dragon philosophy is appropriate only to Dragons. In the case ofvampirism, and those who would play the ersatz bloodsucker, understand that theessences cannot be taken by force. They are only given in love. If one plays theHammer House of Horror Vampire and abducts young females: a) their systems will react by producing chemicals during one's assault uponthem that will completely knock out the chemicals traditionally required, andb) one will rightly and inevitably end up in Broadmoor Hospital or some othermaximum security psychiatric unit. Kenneth Grant stated in his book The Magical Revival that he felt that peopleneed to be initiated and gradually educated with regard to this matter. TheDragon families would echo his caution, but for purely sociopathic reasons.Namely that an outbreak of Vampire related attacks and murders has been reportedin recent years both in Britain and the US. Two young men in England were jailed in 1994, one for slashing the neck of a 15year-old boy and drinking his blood. The other, a 29 year old, was incarceratedfor 9 years after attacking a 15 year old girl and drinking the blood from thewounds he had inflicted. When police eventually tracked him down, a thoroughsearch of his house revealed a book that someone had actually published, inwhich readers were “encouraged to drink the blood of young girls for youthfulpurposes”. The young man, labelled “The Vampire Rapist” was said to be a DevilWorshipper. Let's bite the bullet here. It may appear exclusionist when it comes to thefeelings expressed about people prancing around calling themselves Witches orVampires. However, one sees often the sociological results of the kind of mediaencouragement and advertising that tells people they are all the same and thuscan achieve anything they want. A proportion of these people end up subscribingto this and assume it to be a licence that extends itself to their becoming adanger to other people. One might then appreciate that a restrictive attitudehas some good purpose. Society is encouraged to do what it wants in order that the controlling elitecan make money out of selling goods related to conditioned aspiration. We thenhave a situation where society becomes disaffected and disintegrated because thepeople themselves cannot achieve what the “American Dream” says they canachieve. Mostly this unrest arises as a consequence of the majority simply nothaving the money to spend on fashionable, useless rubbish. However, if peopletranspose this aspirational mentality into changing into people that they cannotbecome, there will be a build-up of resentment and social tension. It is calledthe Politics of Envy. The 29 year-old mentioned had apparently read a book written by someone who hadno knowledge of his subject. This self styled guru of the occult suppliedinformation publicly that resulted in at least one serious maiming incident thatcould easily have resulted in murder. And what's the point? Young girls today are encouraged to behave like loutsbecause loutish girls buy fashionable clothes and alcohol and do a roaring tradefor the music industry. If you removed the abrasive and unattractive exteriorbrainwashing of this modern female fashion victim, deep down inside you wouldprobably find nothing more than a conditioned breeding machine having a “bituvva larf” before it settles down to the next stage of its existence as anefficient consumer-producer. What you would not find is the spirit of theancient of days, the essential genetic makeup of the Dragon princess and theGrail maiden: that rare living goddess whose sacred essences were shed joyouslyin the service of the ancient Vampire Queens and Overlords. These days, any solicitous behaviour either violent or wheedling therefore, isnot going to result in any would-be Vampire extracting anything of value out ofthe modern young woman. She lacks the brain chemistry and the intender lacks thebrain physiology or anatomy to process the chemicals. The whole transaction orincident is therefore a waste of time. The young man cited here was described as a devil worshipper, and he got thatcompletely wrong as well, as we shall see. It is all and only a matter ofchemistry. If you go attacking people their bodies discharge heaps of poisonslike adrenaline, noradrenaline and histamine. Keep attacking people to drinktheir blood and you will drink yourself into stress and an early grave. The process actually ages you so “drinking the blood of young girls for youthfulpurposes” by hacking their necks open in a surprise attack is not particularlybright thinking, is it? Any Vampiric interaction only worked withenthusiastically willing females of pure royal blood who were virgins of acertain age and head over heels in love with the “Vampire”. This precludes any potential advantages that might be anticipated in hangingaround in dark alleys with a questionnaire and a blood testing kit. It couldtake years to find the right victim. In summary and final reiteration one cannot utilise Dragon essences unless onehas the same complementary, genetically inherited brain wiring as the Princesswho donates them. If one doesn't have Dragon synapses, Dragon blood won't makethe connections. One cannot obtain these essences from just any female.Therefore any form of play-acting, poseur vampirism practised by the bored,inadequate chattering classes today is just a manifestation of Freudian sexualpsychosis. Rare is the woman one would worship, but nevertheless all womendeserve respect. "},{"pageContent":"[images/00046.jpg]Chapter 1 A New Age Critique The etymology of the word “Dragon” comes to us via the Latin but is derivedfundamentally from the Greek, though the origin of the word and its definitionis probably much older. The word in Greek is drakon, as in edrakon, an aorist ofDerkesthai, which means “to see clearly”. A Dragon was one who saw clearly, and clarity of vision engendered was alwaysclassically associated with wisdom, which itself produced power. Today we saythat knowledge is power, so nothing has changed in that respect, except that itis actually wisdom—the ability to predict or intuit and synthesise knowledge—aprerequisite of Druidic or Fairy neuro-physiology, that actually affords thegreatest power of all. In a progression of logic that naturally suggests itself, we are thereforeentering in upon the linguistic territory of the Seer, the Witch and the Magus,with whom the foregoing qualities have always been closely identified, a stateof affairs with which etymologists concur. From there, in the Gaelic realms, weencounter the Merlin, a name which, like Dragon, literally means “seer”, and whofurthermore, were of a class of Druid priests or philosophus or magi, as theywere also known in classical times. Anciently the foregoing regional epithetswere all attributed to one royal, priestly tribe originally known inIndo-European as the Arya: the “race of the wise ones”, a caste which wasdescribed in Latin as the nobilis, which is a name that originated from theGreek root gno, meaning “to know”. Similarly the word king is derived from the related Gothic word kuningzam,meaning both “knowing one” and “scion of the noble (meaning wise), race”. Inaddition we have the associated word siddhis, meaning “the powers” and from thisword or vice versa, was derived the tribal name the Scythians, the Arya-Sidhe orSidheans. The siddhi were a range of psychic or paranormal phenomena whichmanifested themselves as the attributes of those Tantric priests in Eurasia whohad attained samadhi or “enlightenment”. These people, coterminously the Aryans or Scythians, who are thought to havedeveloped Tantra in Sumeria, were known as the legendary Tuadha d'Anu (tribe ofAnu and by a traditional, widely known derivation—“people of the stars”) ordaouine sidhe (meaning “people of the powers”) in the Gaelic countries. Theywere the “wise ones”, the Elves or Fairies. From this we can conclude that bycorrect definition, a Dragon was originally (by blood descent from the race ofthe wise) an overlord, an Archdruid or bruidhina, Magus and a seer, an Elvengoddess-queen or god-king. Such are not to be confused with the warrior kings ortinker dynasties installed by the Roman Church over the last 1500 years, norwith any modern royal family. The Druidhe were kings above kings. The Dragon or Fairy gene was very rare and true Archdruidic, royal Dragonfamilies were rarer still. Persecutions excepted, if this were not the caseanyway, then perhaps many Fairy stories of the popular genre which originatedfrom outside the Dragon culture would never have taken hold. The reality of thestories would have been everywhere in everyday life. Traditionally and consistently, the symbol of both wisdom (Sophia) and healingwas the serpent or, as it was also known, the Dragon. In keeping with this, thekings and queens of pre-Catholic history were noted for their healingcapabilities and as such, in Judaic mythology, were called, perhaps, after thearchangel Raphael, the Repha'im or Rapha'Elohim; the healing gods of theAnunnaki. Raphael was the Prince who appeared to Adam in Eden according toMilton. No mention of this is made in Genesis and one suspects that of the two entitiesthat did appear to Adam, Enlil and Enki, or if you like, God and the CatholicSatan, Raphael (the Angel of the Rising Sun), who must have been Enki. It was hewho gave Kingship to man in the form of the Elven Overlords and after whom, byvarious related epithets, including “The Repha’im”, the Elven Kings are known.Authorities believe that these people were identical to both the Nephilim andthe Anakim of Idumea and Canaan. The Anakim are ancient ancestral kings found inthe Old Testament, and it would appear that they originate from peoplesdescended from Black Sea migrants. There is a large number of Scythians in theMiddle East region. In early heraldry, derived from ancient sources, the Dragonwas depicted as a serpent with the wings of a Swan. This image was also giventhe wings of a bat. The Dragon nevertheless was humanoid and so the symbolism in the Dragon glyphshould rather be interpreted to substantiate the etymology of the word itself.The serpent stands for the wisdom and healing powers of the sacred king or queenwhose regalia often consisted of serpent-like scale armour and whoseconsciousness soars above that of humanity as if carried on wings, which wassymbolised by shamanic Swan's feather cloaks. The nocturnal habits of the Dragon people, typically those of the CimmerianScythians, who are a sub group of the Skoloti or Scythian peoples from theSouthern Steppes region of what is now known as Greater Scythia, were noted bytheir contemporaries. The Swan's wings of the Dragon glyph attributed to themwere either interchangeable with, or substituted by, those of the bat to signifythis. One of their earlier names—Anunnaki—suggests “heaven meets earth”. Lots offanciful notions have been put forward to suggest that the Anunnaki were fromouter space, but a far simpler way of understanding the name is to ask a simplequestion: “when do the heavens—the An or Stars—meet the Earth?” The answer is ofcourse—“at night time”. When considering the nature of the Elves or the Anunnaki, rather than believingthey came from a different planet, it might be worth considering that theyoccupied a different dimension. If this sounds equally as fanciful andimplausible, consider this. A multitude of different animal species on thisplanet can be perceived by human sensory capacities and therefore, to allintents and purposes, the physical aspect of their being occupies the humandimension. However, because of their anatomical and physiological make-up, these species’experiences of the same material reality are different and these differences arecaused by, amongst other things, variations in the respective synapticconnections and hormone levels. Consequently these variants are known todifferentiate between the perceptions of their universe and that of humanity.These species actually live in another dimension and at a higher or variantfrequency, where the subjective qualities of time and the environment for themare totally different to the way in which humans perceive them. The level to which the Fairies experienced life was far deeper than the level towhich humans experienced it. In real terms the Fairies inhabited an entirely alien world but occupied thesame planet. In this sense they were from a different dimension, characterisedand regulated by their body chemistry which enabled them to see more in theenvironment than humans could. In this they were no more remarkable than anyother non-human species we are able to study today. Flies, sharks, dolphins anda host of other life forms have attributes and abilities humans do not possess.As a consequence of this, the way in which they interact with the planet iscompletely alien to the way in which humans do. For a fly, time is completelydifferent and for a shark, any warm blooded creature glows with a blue,electro-chemical haze or aura, proving to some extent, the veracity of thetheory of Kirlian photography. The concept of dimension is entirely subjective, as is any concept of reality,which to the greatest extent in humans, is manipulated not only by theirinternal constitutions, but also and largely by external environmentalconditioning and attachment. This training forces humans to subdue and modifytheir internal constitutions in order to align themselves with arbitrary socialexpectations. The consequence of this is to create a dichotomy—an endlesslychattering, self-flagellating, hateful monkey in the human forebrain whoseceaseless din, which humans call reality, prevents the individual from enteringany other form of perception or, if you like, stops them from changing theirdimension. Humans cannot perceive the monkey. However, by virtue of a different chemicalconstitution, the Fairies could, quite naturally, and were able to put it in itscorrect perspective. Once silenced, the monkey which creates the illusion oftime and substance is unable to keep the doors to other dimensions, so securelylocked. The Fairies were Dragons and this means that they “saw clearly”, they sawsubtler emanations than man could. In order to be able to do this the Fairieswould have to have their senses tuned into a higher frequency than man.Therefore the Fairies were tuned to a higher frequency of perception andactivity generally. In cybernetic terms, any system that is faster and consequently higher than agiven base is called a nautonnier or navigator. In cybernetics these systems areset over and in control of the slower functional operations within any givenmechanical or organic arrangement. If we transpose this theory onto humansociety we get leaders and followers. The leaders are supposed to be able tofunction at a faster rate than the followers, and thereby anticipate any givendirection the system might go in and plan sensible strategies that the systemmight adopt for its well-being. Today this is ludicrous. Self-seeking, middle class incompetents more often findthemselves voted in to control what are now vast, unwieldy, outof-control socialsystems which, once upon a time, no one would have trusted to anyone but theElves. In the past therefore, because the Fairies were, for millennia,physiologically bred and exhaustively trained to operate at a higher level thanmen, humans often invited them to become social navigators or nautonniers. TheSumerian word for a navigator is a Gall, which sounds a bit like a Gael, doesn'tit? The language of the western Royal Scythians was Gaelic and the RoyalScythians were the Fairies, the Elves: the Dragons. The Dragon's fiery breath symbolised the pneuma, the spirit of the divine, whichcoalesced into the Torah or cosmic law that the Dragon queens and kingsdelivered as their pronouncements in the affairs of man. Thus the image of theDragon of myth and legend is complete, as a set of symbolic attributes belongingto an ancient magical race of praeter-natural beings, the vampyr overlords orFairy overkings. Although humanoid, Dragons were not Homo Sapiens but decended from the far olderElven race, sometimes called in literature the Elda or Eldar. This was probablysuggested or derived from the name of an ancient queen and her ancient, formerhabitation in Mesopotamia and possibly intended, in its attribution as a similefor Elder perhaps, to imply some form of racial primogeniture. Reflected upon within the context of early Sumerian historical records, such asynonym would indeed seem to be apposite, inasmuch as this ancient andmysterious people claimed that the Dragons, with Queen Hawah Elda's assistance,created mankind. Homo Sapiens?From the OED (Oxford English Dictionary, used often as a reference in thiswork), we learn that the prefix homo has two meanings. There is the Latinmeaning (from whence comes “man”), and the Greek meaning, as in homo-genous,which means “common”, “the same” or “the same as”, “average”, “mediocre”. The word sapiens is itself derived from the Latin word “sapienta” meaningunderstanding. However it was also a word which was used in a solely pejorativeand derogatory context—from as far back as the Middle English period—explicitlyin the sense of artful, deceitful, contrived or would-be wisdom; meaningsophistry or low cunning and hypocrisy. From sapienta we derive the slangderogative sap, which has been used throughout the Englishspeaking world totaunt idiots and fools. Hereto, jocularly, in contemporary currency the phrase homo sapiens could,therefore, define a common, undistinguished hominid species. Its members wouldact in the same manner and think the same self-deluding thoughts, relating toeach other through a veil of deception, within a limited field of consciousresponses and conditioned reflexes, rather like sheep. Taken in relation to what man has done to the planet and to his fellowcreatures, the author doesn't think that this is an unwarranted orunsubstantiated attack, but a justifiable observation. Man aptly named himself:homo = mediocre + sapiens = cunning. Therefore man could be defined by the Oxford English Dictionary, the recognisedauthority on, and arbiter of the English language, as being uniquely, thoroughlystupid and dim-witted, and his species description has incorporated within it aclear indication that this condition is genetically inherited. Nurture seemsunable to ameliorate what nature has here ordained. Here the idealist might argue that a eugenic solution, mediated through geneticengineering could produce a more passive, thoughtful population by weeding outthe stupid gene and replacing it with something that would make us all lesswasteful, aggressive and acquisitive. Take a look around you, who runs the planet? That's right—the multinationalcorporations. And what is their raison d'etre? To force people to producerubbish for the same people to buy. Where does the funding come from forscientific research grants? From the multi-national corporations or viagovernments who are subservient to, because they are paid for by, those samecorporations. Would either support any form of research that would make peoplerefuse to fight their wars for them or consume less of their pointless rubbish?No. At present, genetic engineering for the most part is becoming yet anothermanifestation of human megalomania within a world socio-economic system thatowes its very existence to the continued cultivation and promotion by thecorporate elites, of mass psychosis on an international scale. This is a sadindictment upon the entire human race. The evidence speaks for itself and afterseveral millennia of wars and destruction, culminating in the present series ofsocial and ecological disasters, it doesn't seem that homo sapiens will ever beanything other than what they are. Furthermore, this is a profitable, andtherefore a protected and encouraged, irremediable and irreversible, geneticcondition. In contrast the Dragons or Draco Sentiens, according to the most ancientdefinitions, were, once upon a time, long ago, genetically “clear sighted”members of the elder race, the “race of the wise”. It therefore follows inconclusion that, because of the neurophysiological, and consequently thecognitive and psychological differences between the two, neither was of the samespecies as the other, and the ancient Sumerian texts would uphold this viewwithout question. Grail Code—What Grail Code? A Personal ViewPeople enter relationships that serve their own interests or the interests ofthe “extended self”. In the end, therefore, all human endeavour is self centred,and all is “egotism”. Beyond the facile exterior, there may be something ofgreater merit dwelling in the depths of the silence, but it is often notevident. However “bigger” any greater, non-personalised aim might be, it isstill serving itself and its own interests through the drives it instils inpeople. The universe eats the universe as a manifestation of a larger cosmicegotism which cares nothing for the “rights” of Man. The Universe has no contract with humanity, and therefore no contract men havewith each other has any valid basis in reality either. In times past they wouldspeak of the “Covenant with God”. Now certain individuals pontificate vacuouslyabout “The Grail Code”. Both—then and now—can only be seen as fraudulentcontracts which no party can uphold because neither party can fulfil theobligations or restrict themselves to the limits implied within them. Abiding,externalised, imposed contracts are not a part of natural law. Individuals tolerate each other's peccadilloes if they have something tocontribute to each other which is valued. The “Grail Code” of service to othersis prominent in its absence because the relationships people have are driven bya financial imperative. This makes the statements of collective high idealismjust that, a hollow mockery of something that died out long ago. The Grail Codetoday is just another clichéd phrase, a meaningless piece of “New Age” verbosityaimed at selling contrived, pseudo-intellectual, academically amateur jingoismto frightened, greedy fools. Religious coercion is now replaced by jargonistic phrases, which try to promoteweak, “New Age” philosophies that, like religion, are engineered to appeal to orcoerce (for selfish motives) a higher sense in man that simply doesn't exist.For the Grail Code to work as it was envisaged or understood, everyonesubscribing to it now would have to think with one mind and not considerindividual gain before the welfare of the group. This is simply not happening.Nor will it. Service to others without thought of self requires others to serve you withequal dedication and devotion if you and the group—collectively—are to survive. The Grail Code in the distant past was neither a contract nor an ideal. It wasthe manifestation of a type of behaviour which was subsequent to a particularform of consciousness. How Did It Work?Hierogamy or enthea (the marriage or union of the gods) between the DragonPrince and the Swan Maiden resulted in the creation of an extended mind, thedevelopment of an interaction where the bounds of individual consciousness werebroken. Two people joined together with an intensity that created a beinggreater than the sum of its parts. In alchemy this was called the breath ofRavens from which resulted the birth of the red-gold Phoenix, conceived in thedeath of Dragons and born in the ascent of the white star. The way these twoindividuals treated each other was called True or Courtly Love. If thisphenomenon happened on a wider scale within the genome, then it, along withother universal phenomena, was a part of the Web of Wyrd, the unseen connectingthreads of the underlying matrix of life. Its child was True Love manifestcollectively, which was called the Grail Code. Jesus called it “the Law of Godwritten on the hearts of men in tongues of fire”. Genetic righteousness. The Grail Code was the behavioural manifestation of an attuned group of empathicindividuals working towards the common good of that group. This required a “HiveMind”—a collective consciousness—or at least a heightened capacity towardssensitivity and the anticipation of the needs of all within the genome, thattranscended common consciousness. Therefore it was a manifestation of theoutworking of the Siddhis within the web of interrelated and interconnectedpoints of consciousness that are manifest throughout all levels of life. The Grail Code, therefore, was a set of behavioural patterns that arose fromwithin in response to a particular psychological condition that has detachmentas its hallmark. It was not imposed from without by people with vested interestsfor their own ends or for the ends of any other disassociated group ofindividuals. Without the “Hive Mind” (symbolised in the Dragon Dynasty by the MerovingianBee, the Phoenician “House of the Gods” and the hexagonal figure of the Tree ofLife of the Kabala) the Grail Code is a meaningless set of unattainable socialaspirations. To the “New Age” authors and devotees—the people left outside the group whodon't have the wiring or chemistry to participate and understand the collectivemind—the Grail Code is just another set of rules. However prettily andromantically packaged, these rules will inevitably be broken, and are thereforeno better or worse than any other meaningless regulations. The universe has features which are prime constants. The behaviour of materialsis one example, which we call the “laws of physics”. These we can term truths,because they don't vary under a given range of circumstances. Even down at thesub atomic level, the peculiarities are constant, inasmuch as they areconstantly peculiar. Without these prime constants the universe would cease toexist. The Grail Code, as a worthy set of regulations or aspirations for the governanceof people's behaviour in relationship to each other is, quite frankly, anidealistic load of nonsense. It isn't that the Grail Code is a fantasy or a lie.It is simply a fact that it was and still is misapplied, and to the wrongpeople. Relatively and contextually speaking, the Grail Code is not a truth, because itis not a constant, and it cannot be applied to regulate human behaviour in humansocieties. We know this because it caused, in part, the manifestation of a setof social conditions which were required in order to allow to occur the 1000year genocide which is referred to in the Family as the Elven Holocaust. Thisresulted ultimately in the abandonment of the Grail Code itself. What was the big mistake the Family made? They did unto others as they wouldhave done unto themselves. In other words they used the transcendently inspiredGrail Code they anciently applied to their own mystical race to order societiesthat were founded not upon transcendent perception, but upon animal instincts. The Grail Code was applicable only to the Grail Blood. Elsewhere the only thingthat worked was the law of the jungle and terrorism. The Family was seen as asoft touch because their empathy was extended to peoples who had no empathythemselves—only the desire to satisfy their own greed and assuage their ownfears. These peoples' selfish, individualistic motivations stood in direct oppositionto the Grail Code of “royal communism” and community service. Desire is a greatmotivator in any society and the Elves' desires were motivated by theirtranscendent consciousness, which could only operate in an environment of truthand empathy. The more one sees, the less one desires for oneself and the less attached onebecomes. If one desires truth and sees only truth and gives instinctively forthe common good because one can feel the common need, one becomes the target foropportunists and deceivers. Faced with the violence and hostility of a group of myopic animals hell bent ontheir pursuing their own interests and unable to see the bigger picture, theElves had no chance of survival anyway, whatever the other circumstances mighthave been. This alone was enough to destroy them. In a sense then, the GrailCode was a death sentence to the Dragon Families. This, perhaps, is how theMayors of the Palace took over, through exploiting what they perceived as theinnate trust, complacency and weakness of the Merovingian kings. One can appear dark or harsh in one's attitudes towards human beings and humanbehaviour and one may make people wonder how one could possibly preach about theGrail on one hand and despise humans so much on the other. After all, isn't theGrail Code all to do with being nice to each other? Isn't it about being fair toone's fellow man? Doesn't it fit in with the overall ethos of the “New Age”? Theanswer to all these rhetorical questions is an absolute No. It isn't and itdoesn't. The Grail Code is the perfect example of an ill-advisedly applied series ofinnate laws arising from the profound depths of the genetic constitution of onespecies, applied to and completely misunderstood and abused by another. Look around you and judge for yourself. After a thousand years of tyrannicalmisrule, European society is finally beginning to throw off the shackles ofmerchant class stupidity. Unfortunately this new found dissent and “freedom” hasno direction either, and the path society is treading will inevitably becomelittered with the corpses of the fallen. People aren't naturally “nice” to each other. They are simply conditioned tofear the consequences of not appearing to be nice to each other. Even so, thisbarrier is now breaking down and at the grassroots level, society is becomingmore violent as individuals embrace selfish opportunism and disregard theirconditioning. There is a stark difference between the two concepts and conditions of naturalempathy and social fear. One comes from within, the other is applied fromwithout. If people were naturally co-operative and naturally empathic, the GrailCode would be a universal behavioural constant in an ordered world of ecologicalsensitivity and social harmony. This, plainly and manifestly is not, and neverhas been the case, and certainly not since the Church came to power. The GrailCode arises naturally from, and is pertinent solely to, the Grail Blood. The Grail Code is the behavioural benchmark by which those of the Grail orDragon Blood might be recognised, but it is not the code that efficiently ordersthe behaviour of the Dragon Families in their dealings with those not of theGrail Blood. In Genesis of the Grail Kings Laurence Gardner commented on the love that theAnunnaki had for social order, which was echoed in Transylvania where Vampireswere said to have a reputation for pathological meticulousness and where nearby,Dracula ran his kingdom with the precision of a well oiled machine. In the earlier days of the Anunnaki it is quite feasible that the collectiveempathic consciousness was particularly strong and we might see here thefoundation of the Grail Code within the family of the Gods. Nevertheless, laterthere were still incidents of internecine strife. However, where outsiders wereconcerned, the Grail Code was only applied inasmuch as it related to maintainingorder for the benefit of the Overlords. Was there any question of the Gods being“nice” to man or applying the Grail Code solely for man's benefit? There was adifference between the Grail Code for the Grail Blood and the Grail Code as itapplied to man. One has to say that Enlil was right, concerning his rivalry withEnki and their differing views on treatment toward man. As the Blood weakened, the capacity to apply empathy and co-operationappropriately weakened. This resulted initially in family wars, and latterly inthe kind of mental weakness, confusion and cultural misapplication which endedin the genocide of the race by Catholic opportunists. These are pertinent lessons that the Bloodline would do well to learn if it isto rebuild itself again. It doesn't necessarily mean, because the Bloodline isat the end of the seventh millennium of its recorded history, that it is toolate to turn back the clock. However, if the Dragon is to survive at all, itmust learn the lessons of history, redefine its identity and strive to enrichits Blood once more. If it doesn't, its culture will die completely. An old saying from British folklore asserts that if the land loses its Elves,the land dies. In two thousand years the face of the countryside in Britain andIreland in particular has changed completely and there is now nowhere that manhasn't manipulated, exploited or raped. Compared to what it was, the land isindeed dead. Its spirit has almost gone. The spirit of the land, its innate magic and mystery, has died because the Elveshave all but died as well. The land consequently has no real voice anymore, nochampions and no orators. Without the Dragon Queens and the Elven Overlords tointerpret the will of the Earth (and without Brehon Law to protect it fromfools) man himself fails to hear the deeper message the land gives him. The ancient forests of giant Oak and Beech are no more, and the sacred placeshave been either built on in acts of blasphemy by an evil religion or torn up bythe mindless merchant-class ancestors of today's mindless, middle-class consumerpopulation. In the theory of critical mass, sometimes called the “99th Monkey Effect”—basedon Jung's theory of Collective Consciousness working through Rupert Sheldrake's“Field of Morphic Resonance”—the collective mind of a race creates a spiritualand cultural archetype whose field of resonance can be felt in the materialworld. In the case of the Elves, that Archetype was manifest in the Age ofMagic. Simply put, when the Elves lived, they created a field of magic aroundthem, the power of which arose from the very sovereignty of the earth itself.However, when the Church killed the Elves, the Earth was silenced and the magiclargely died. Having assisted the Church to kill off the Elves, man now stands alone against abeing he uses with contempt for his own gain, but whose power against him islimitless and whose patience with him is not. The highest socalled authoritieson Earth have finally realised what they have done and even they, the UnitedNations Organisation, say that the clock is ticking and time is running out. The spirit of True Romance and Magic is all but dead. It diminished when theChurch enslaved the spirit of mankind to a material, hateful god. However, theSundered Tribes can be reborn, the Dragon blood can be restored and enriched,and the Dragon Queens and Elven Lords can rise once more to restore to people asense of wonder, a sense of hope and an Age of Magic.

Here must The Mark remain as witnessto such love as nothing can remove, or blur, or hide, save Suicide. —Robert Graves Some of the earliest evidence of Ritual Vampirism comes from Tartaria inTransylvania and stems to the fifth-millennium BC. Remains of a human body werefound buried in a fire pit along with clay tablets upon which were inscribed thenames of the Sumerian god Enki and the ranking number of Father Anu. Thelanguage was subsequently termed proto-Sumerian and represented some of theearliest written artifacts yet to be found. The descendants of these early Vampires were the sacred Ubaid race who, onemillennium later, settled Mesopotamia and founded the Anunnaki religion of theSumerians in 3500 BC. Their Transylvanian ancestors were the Anunnaki Godsthemselves. Various suggestions have been proposed in an attempt to explain the origin andmeaning of the word Vampire. One recent suggestion was that it was applied to agroup of “Watchers” (Seers-Derkesthai: Dragons) who had occupied a settlementnear Lake Van, in Urartu , Armenia. The original location— Greater Scythia—isfaultless, the association is without error but the etymology is unresearchedand the philology is completely absent. Although that author's suggested identification between Watchers and Vampires isabsolutely correct, the word Vampire does not in any sense relate to theirformer geographical location or origin. It relates rather to the Vampires'social and spiritual identity and status within a given cultural framework,which in this instance was Scythian, overlaid on Celtic. In the journals of the 17th-century cleric, the Abbe Calmet, the word Vampire istransliterated into its most common, and its earlier, central European formwhich is spelt either oupire or oupere. These spellings are common in literatureof Calmet's time and represent the original form of the word Vampire. When the word migrated into Latin from Anatolian the u became a v because, as wewill recall, there is no u character represented in the Latin alphabet. If therehad been, then the Latinised western European construction of the word wouldhave been uampire. By now bells should be ringing in the readers' heads as theyremember hearing about wampires somewhere or another, perhaps in a humorouscontext. The Romans didn't have a w and this letter appeared in clerical Latin during themedieval period as v v, as presented in the ridiculous text book Latin phrasemortvvs svm. The vv being used then as a long vowel sound to differentiatebetween u and v sounds which were both represented by the Latin v. So to recap, let's have a look at the linguistic migration so far: oupere—oupire—owpire—ovpire. At this point we must remember that the word migrated fromone language into another at a time when the most commonly used form oftransmission was oral. This was bound to lead to confusion when the word waswritten down for the first time, as it has in numerous other instances. By now we should be asking “If the word Vampire was originally spelt oupire,where on earth did the “m” come from?” All the author can say is thank heavensfor the anomalous “m” because it is this component that really confirms theorigin and meaning of the word Vampire, according to currently acceptedscholarship. Philologists would agree that the word Vampire, as oupere, in its present formoriginated from the Turkish word uber, which means “Witch”. This would appear topresent even more problems because in addition to an anomalous “m”, we now alsohave a “b” to explain away! Nevertheless the author promises you that tenacityand perseverance will bring its own rewards. Leaving the “m” aside for a moment, there would seem to be a serious linguisticproblem in that oupere is spelt with a “p” and uber with a “b”, which the readermight suspect would undermine the connection between both words. Especiallysince Vampire or oupere is European and uber is Turkish and thus from a separatelanguage group. However, this is not so. As the Turkic-Uralic language is very different from Indo-European, it wouldappear that the word Vampire in its original form is not IndoEuropean, but anAsiatic word that has changed in spelling and pronunciation during the passageof time and its migration northward. It might then appear that the central Asian word for a Witch—uber— would meansomething entirely different to the European meaning of the word and wouldtherefore bring with it an entirely different set of cultural and mythicassociations. However, what the reader might not realise is that modern Turkeyand its language is, like any other, an evolutionary compilation of historical,linguistic and cultural influences. Prior to being named Turkey, Asia Minor, or Anatolia, it was the centre of theeastern Roman Empire of Byzantium. At the heart of Asia Minor, contemporary withRome but originating from an earlier period still, was the vast region ofGalatia. In the centre of this was a region occupied in the Persian era by theCimmerians of Scythia, at a time when Galilee, Gilead and Gaulatinis in northernIsrael were Scythian territories named after their language. As Galatia spread northwards it bordered upon Phrygia and Troy and reached outfurther still to become Galati as it crossed the Bosphorus and encompassedTransylvania. On its westward marches Galati assimilated both Bulgaria and Gaul. In consequence of this, a massive proportion of what is now called Turkey was infact, along with most of Europe, Gaelic or properly Goidelic speaking, aScythian/Celtic civilisation, comprising of independent tribal groups who spokea number of Gaelic dialects. Amongst these and most notably are what we now knowas the so-called “P” and “Q” or “K” Goidelic language variants. The P and Q variants in Brythonic-Cymric (Welsh) and Goidelic-Scotic (IrishScots), as an example, mean that the word “son” will be spelt map in Cymric andmac in Scotic. Furthermore there is a sub variant in this language group where“P” and “B” sounds also become interchangeable. For example, the Welsh pen as inthe mountain—Penllithrig'y'wrach—meaning “the slippery hill of the Witch” inSnowdonia, and the Scots ben as in Ben Nevis in Scotland—both of which mean“head” or “peak”. The Cymric language was originally Cimmerian or northernScythian, whilst Scotic is a southern Scythian dialect. The Galatian word uber is from the Scythian Goidelic group whilst in Russia andPoland, which was influenced by the Cimmerian or Brythonic group, the same wordfor Vampire is spelt upyr and upior respectively. There have been numerousScythian migrations over the millennia and the Gaelic language has been carriedacross the Eurasian continent to influence the languages of many peoples. TheTrojans, who lived next door to the Galatians and were themselves Scythians,moved to Italy and became the Latines. In Latin therefore, we can find both uber—rich or fruitful—and s/uper— “over” or“above” as in umpire (no peer) and supervisor. In Northern Germany (low German)and Holland (middle Dutch) upper means “situated higher than or above another orothers”, whilst in modern German we find uber, again meaning over or above,having the spelling variants ober, uberi, ubar, and associated with “superiorityin power, position and station to others”. As we can see by this example, the b has consistently become a v and this is howwe know that the word for a Vampire uber, is not a Turkish word at all butGaelic or Galatian. Remember the anomalous “m” in Vampire? Well, it just sohappens that in dialectic Gaelic the consonant group Mh is pronounced V. The “h”became discarded over time and left the “m” in Vampire where the “u” or “v”should be. If spelt literally, Vampire would be uavber, uauber or uaupir, whichis the central European oupire or oupere. These variants stem from the Sanskrit upari (Up-Ari or Up-Arya, meaningOver-Lord) for which the Greek is uper—which, as we have already seen, is acomponent of super in Latin. Over (ME—ouere) began as a graphic variant of uuerewhich translates into the dynastic name Vere with the Latin V beinginterchangeable with the double U or hard Germanic W which became V—renderingVer or Were. This is pronounced as a soft F, which we find in the Norse Yfariand the old English Uffara or Yffera. The Turkish, or properly Galatian word Uber, meaning “Witch” thereforelinguistically corresponds to the foregoing variations found in Gothic, German,Dutch, Norse English, Greek, Latin and Sanskrit, where finally, as Upari, wediscover that originally Uber—Vampire—meant Overlord. In the followingparagraphs we shall investigate the cultural background behind the word “Witch”as uber, and discover that what holds true linguistically is supported bycultural and social evidence. Contextually, when applied to an individual as a “Witch”, the word uber wouldsuggest that the person referred to was in some way “over” or “above” others, asin the German übermensch or überherren. The Germanic languages, as with theothers sampled here, are all Indo-European and the Sanskrit in particular, beingof Aryan or Scythian origin, is closest to the Galatian, and we shall see thatthe argument for overlordship is exactly the case. From a cultural standpoint, we read the word “Witch” and with it comes a largetrolley of baggage that we have inherited from the popularly reinforcedunderstanding of the word, influenced heavily by Fairy stories and biasedhistories told from a protagonistic point of view. Today the specifically Saxonword “Witch” tends to conjure up images of old hags prancing about on dark,spooky moors and cackling into cauldrons. Witch is derived from the Saxon root word wicce (feminine) or Wicca (masculine).The Saxons used it to describe a class of persons whom they thought wereinhabited by an intelligence or spirit—a daemon or genii, usually evil—theSaxons took up Catholicism pretty early on in their careers and wereconsequently biased. Conversely, some people today would like us to believe, however, that “Witch”meant a “wise one” and say that Witchcraft, or in Saxon—wiccecraeft as they liketo call it—means craft of the wise, failing completely to realise that the wordwise in Saxon is wita, not Wicca or wicce. Wicca is actually related to both “wicker” and “Viking” or Wiking, as the Norsewould pronounce it. In Russia the word Vikhr, meaning whirlwind, is a title ofthe Zmei Dragons, sons and daughters of Zmei-Tiamat. This confirms that the linkbetween Sumaire, Zmei or Zumei and Sumeria was also known in Russia, once aViking province. It also demonstrates that the Danish Vikings, Witch lords, were sons of theDragon and the Scandinavian Tuadha d'Anu. In Ireland the Zmei Lord or Vikhr isknown as the Dark King—the Whirlwind—meaning he was sumaire or Vampire and viaUber, a Witch Lord or Wicca. As the Willow (wicker) bends and yields to thewhirlwind, so the Witch (Wicca) yields to the Sumaire, the ancient Vampirelegacy within him or her; a legacy that is awakened during the Mass of thePhoenix, when the primordial ancestors rise from the dead to take possession ofthe Witch's soul! Wicca, derived from the same Saxon word as Willow, means to “bend or yield”one’s spirit to that of a daemon (Greek, meaning preter-human intelligence orinspiration), giving the Christian idea of possession, though erroneously. TheWitch was indeed possessed by a daemon and that daemon was certainlypreter-human and not of this world. Any spirit, including the archangels, conjured by the Witch or magician (thedistinction, like that between pagan and Christian, is fallacious), as inceremonial magic, was actually the ancestor (antecessor) of the Witch herself(or himself). It was a denizen of the ancient Dragon itself—but carried in theWitch's blood which, the purer it was through unbroken descent from the Dragons,the stronger would be the return of the ancestors within. The stronger the bloodthe stronger the invocation and the more complete the possession. With mixedblood there was weak inspiration and little discernible presence. “The Blood isthe Life”. The Witch was possessed by this daemon, because the Witch by descent andheredity was that daemon itself. It was his or her genetic inheritance and partof his or her racial consciousness. To that the Witch would yield, when occasionnecessitated, placing the Witch and the words wicce or Wicca firmly in thetradition of the trance seer (Derkesthai), a practice rooted in Scythianshamanic culture. This is confirmed in the word genius, meaning inborn intellect or inspiration.Closely related to this word is genie, meaning a spirit, as in genius loci—“aspirit of place”. In Arabic the jinni is a spirit of fire or inspiration. TheLatin genius, in Greek, is a daemon or inspiring intelligence and the root Latingens signifies birth, origin and especially blood. The daemon or genius of theDragons was inherited through the blood. Witches are born. Not made by sillyplay-acting initiation rituals. A seer in Gaelic was called a Merlin and in the tripartite Aryan-Scythian castesystem which overlaid that of their clients, the deeply religious Celts, theMerlin was a Druid Prince. Either side of the Druidic caste were the castes ofthe warrior aristocrats and the craftsmen and, although they all tended tobehave as equals in this king-tribe system, the Druids were senior in rank. Each caste attended to their allotted tasks. The study, teaching and practice ofshamanism and magic were strictly the province of the Druids and Druidesses,forming part of a vast storehouse of knowledge and experience in the crafts andsciences, and in statesmanship and lore. The Druids were responsible for bringing into being gods for the Celts toworship. Though they were not religious themselves, scholars agree that Druidismwas the “religion” of the Celtic world. So we can see that although the Celtshad their own caste system with their own burgh kings or chieftains, above themwere the Scythian kings, and above the Scythian kings were the Elven Druids, thePriest Kings who stood above all others, the ultimate Overlords of Eurasia. In the Scandinavian countries, the craft or ability to gain wisdom or power(Sanskrit—Siddhi) by yielding to daemons or intelligences (ancestral god spiritswhich were part of the practitioners' own genetic inheritance and make-up)through trance or dream states, was considered to be shamanic and was calledSiddir, whilst those who practiced this art were themselves called Siddirs. TheSiddir knotted together the web of dreams and loosened those knots to releasepower and knowledge. In other words, they brought together and spoke orgesticulated a series of mnemonics that would trigger off precontrived,imprinted states of consciousness that acted as doorways into deeper seats ofconsciousness. In Gaelic Scythian this ability and the name corresponding to itwas called the Sidhe, a term used to describe and name the Irish Fairies, theTuadha d'Anu or Tuatha de Danaan as they were later called, a race of priestkings or Druid princes. The Web of Dreams relates to both the Witches' knotted ball and the Web ofWyrdor Fate (fata-Fairy). In the Scythian and Celtic cosmology, the powerassociated with it was thought to reside in the Otherworld. This was the realmof the gods (Druidic ancestors) which was entered via trance or dream states,achieved whilst the Druid or Druidess occupied the Fairy hills, the mortuaryraths where the forefathers were buried. The Witch, as a seer or Merlin in Scythian culture and society, consequentlybelonged to an exclusive genome within a distinct holy and royal caste ofoverlords. This is reflected in the Gaelic word for a Witch— Druidhe—which ispronounced Drui and is related to Draoi and Dracoi, meaning a Dragon. Druiitself means Man (or Woman) of the Tree (not men of the oaks, as some havesuggested) and is also related to the Sanskrit dru, meaning to run. This isassociated with the ritual of running the labyrinth, with which we will deal indue course. Therefore in Galatia, which had its own Druids and was the site of the Nemeton,the largest regular gathering of Druids in Europe, the term for a Witch wasUber, meaning Overlord, whilst in the Gaelic west the term for a Witch wasDruidhe, which meant the same as Uber—an Overlord. In summary, Vampire in its earlier form—oupire—derives ultimately from theGalatian Uber, which itself is derived from the Aryan Upari and linguisticallyand contextually the Vampire—the Witch or Druid—was a Scythian High Queen orKing: an Overlord. Calmet was an official Vampire investigator accompanying imperial officers andsoldiers throughout the Austrian Empire in the 17th century. It is interestingto note in this context that he found no evidence whatsoever to support anynotion that vampirism was a supernatural phenomenon committed by preter-naturalbeings—which he utterly refutes. Neither did he find that it ever occurred inany form, either as a cult or in any isolated incidents, amongst the lowerstrata of society. Without exception the enlightened Abbe was able to discover perfectly ordinaryexplanations for the incidents he had investigated, which in his day was quiteremarkable, as the Church in past times had actively promoted Vampire paranoia. As Professor Margaret Murray discovered herself, vampirism was not theprerogative of the merchant or peasant classes, but was a cultic observanceconfined to the environs of the nobility, often as an adjunct to rites of theNoble and Royal Witch Covens of Scotland. We can say with confidence then that real vampirism was indulged in by livingbeings who, unerringly, were members of the pre-Christian and antiChristian highnobility and royalty. The most famous Vampire stories, those of Dracula, Bathoryand de Rais, support this conclusion. The historical evidence therefore supportsthe etymological origin of the word “Vampire”—an Overlord. Vampirism, up until the early 1700's, by which time it had been in decline forseveral centuries, was not merely or solely the practice of a few isolated,high-born opportunists seeking some form of personal advantage or satisfyingprivate perversions. Vampirism took two forms and the bloodline descendants ofthe ancient Vampire lords had, in Britain, set the practice within an overall,multi-faceted social and cultural framework, stemming from the Iron Age, thatnever gets an airing in the Gothic novel. Vampires weren't just Vampires, as popular literature would have us believe.They were individuals and families who used the practice to achieve specificaims and thereby fulfil those specific social obligations which, since theScythian-Celtic period of the High Dragon Kings, were equated with their rankand position as leaders and overseers. The ScythiansThroughout this discourse it must be borne in mind that when we speak of theScythians as “Fairies”, “Dragons”, “Vampires” or “Elves”, we are not talkingabout either the client races of the Scythians, or the ordinary Scythiancitizenry, but of “Royal Scythians”. As we have discovered that the Vampire—as a “Witch”—belonged by geneticinheritance, to a distinct royal caste in Scythian-Celtic society: that of thepriest-king or priestess-queen, the prince and princess-Druids. They had evolvedvery early on in human social history and belonged to a Eurasian-wide hereditarypriestly community which had originated with the Scythian-Aryans. The nameScythian was originally spelt Sithian in 16thcentury England, and it is fromthis tribal name that we obtain the word scythe, denoting a curved bladedagricultural tool, so-named because of its similarity in shape to the Scythiansword. The Scythians were not, however, named after their use of a curved sword. Thename Sithian is related to a group of words that appear in IndoEuropeanlanguages which are found as far apart as Eire and Northern India, indicatingthat they had a common Aryan origin in Scythia. These include Sithia, Sidhe,Siddir and Siddhi. In Cymric “dd” is pronounced “th”, whilst in Irish and Scots the “th” is speltdialectically “dh” whilst the “s” beginning a word is pronounced “sh”. As wehave related, the Siddir in Danish society were Witches who practiced the art ofknot tying and loosening. These Siddir were directly related to the mythic Norns, the Mori or Fates whowere said to be responsible for the fate of mankind by the patterns that theywove and in the way that they tied and loosened the knots of the Web of Wyrd.The Siddirs, as well as being seers, could control such power as to influencethe outcome of human affairs. In this respect their name reflects theirabilities which, in India, were called the Siddhis, a word used to describe thepowers of the Yogi who had self-realised. The curious Irish word—Sidhe—pronounced “shee”, “sheeth” or “sheeth-ay”,attributed to the Fairies and meaning “powers”, is therefore identical to Siddir(sheeth-eer) and Siddhi (sheeth-ee) and is derived therefore, from the people ofthe powers—the Scythians or Sidheans (sheetheeans). In Scotland the royalFairies were called the Seelie or Sheelie and their princesses were related tothe sculpted Sheelagh Na Gigs over Church doorways, who do NOT depict ancientgoddesses of fertility, but were the royal Grail Maidens of the Elven kings andqueens. The Sheelagh na Gigs were goddesses of sovereignty and transcendence. Theirplace over the doorways of Churches, many of which were built on the sites ofancient sacred groves, indicated that in entering these buildings one wasentering through the vulva of the maiden into the Otherworld, the realm ofElphame and the Kingdom of Heaven. They were permitted above Church doorways because the early Church itself wantedto be identified with the old ways. Firstly this was because it was in fact, atleast in the beginning, part of the old ways and later, when Catholicism tookover, the Sheelaghs remained in place—in order to attract and convert “pagans”. Along with the Irish Sidhe, the Seelie and the Seelie Court of Scotland had adistinctly royal origin in the Tuadha d'Anu who, when asked, like their Pictishdescendants in Scotland, said of themselves that they were Scythian, as CanonBourke himself has insisted. Some people tend to think that the word sidhe means a hill and therefore thatthe Irish Danaan, as the Sidhe, inherited this name as a consequence of fleeinginto the hills after their defeat by the Milesians. As we can see, this is notso and the Fairy “hills”, where the Aes Dan or Danaan, the gods of the Irish,were said to live, were not all Sidhe hills. These—the power hills—were the sacred temple-mortuary raths and barrows, thecreachaires or tomb-sepulchres, that the Danaan priest-kings were wont toritually occupy for millennia before moving to Eire, and centuries before theirIberian kinsmen, the Milesians, came looking for a fight. The Sidhe, theFairies, were the “controllers of the fate of mankind” and so named inremembrance of, and in identification with, their ancient Anunnaki (Anunnagi)ancestors. In pre-Christian history, although some practiced agriculture for a while,according to Murray-Hall, they abandoned it for their traditional way of lifeand many of the Scythian clans remained solitary and insular nomadicpastoralists—horse lords who ranged across large tracts of Europe and Asia forcenturies. Others opted later for a more settled existence and mixed settledagriculture with pastoralism, a system that can be found in both Takla Makan,where they built fine cities, and in Ireland, where they became know as thetrooping Fairies. In general they were usually tall, pale skinned, with golden red hair and greeneyes, unlike the Celts, who were stocky and squat, with ruddy complexions anddark hair. They practiced settled agriculture from a very early period. The recent and rather unfortunate propagandist depiction of the Aryan (Scythian)as a tall, ruddy complexioned blonde racist yeoman-farmer-warrior-god has nobasis in truth. In pre-Christian history an Aryan was a High King, a warrior wasa warrior and a farmer was a farmer and “ne'er the three e'er met.” The realAryans of fact were red-haired and green-eyed. Their hired military help,derived from their lower Ksatriya caste, were not Aryan and were sometimesblonde and blue-eyed. The Aryan royal families didn't intermarry with other tribes or castes but,despite this, with the development by many of their clans of settled citystates,they became urban multi-racial and appreciated cultural diversity. The Aryan Hittites in particular were close allies of the Jews whose Draconianroyal family, the House of David, made the Israelites, in a cultural sense, anearly Aryan nation. The Scythians and the Aryan Scythian Gaels had numeroussettlements either in or adjacent to Israel and Judea. The comparatively early use of the horse and of horse related technologyseparated the Aryans from the other tribes that occupied the Middle-East andEurasia. In Mittani, Mesopotamia, Akkad and Anatolia, the Hurrians (whom in the1920's B. Hrozny described as the earliest Hindus) were the absolute Overlordsand their supremacy is credited to their early use, like the Kurgans, ofhorsedrawn chariots. The Hur syllable in Hurrian has been asserted by scholars, including G. Contenau(La Civilisation des Hittites et des Hurrites de Mittani) to be Har or Ar,meaning that the Hurrians, like the Scythians, were Aryans with an Aryan Vedicroyal-sacral family of gods. They bestowed these upon the Hittites whose culturethey dominated, the Hurrian or Aryan Mittani did in Mesopotamia. The Hittites,in turn, provided the Greeks with these red-gold haired gods, including Zeus orDyas Pater—the Jewish Jehovah, whose ancient symbol, shared with the sacreddynasty as a whole was, ironically, the Swastika. The early “Scythians”, the people of the powers, occupied a region spanning theBalkans, Transylvania, Carpathia, the Ukraine and later, Siberia and Takla Makanwhere the Tocharians, as the Elves were mistakenly called by early linguists,spoke a ritual language. This is now called Tocharian “A”, but originated inThrace in 1800 BC. Thus it had connections with the Fir Bolg and consequentlywith the Tuadha d'Anu as a whole, who began migrating from Central Europe toIrelandat that period. Over the centuries, from 5000 BC onwards, the Scythians had also migrated intothe Middle-East and had provided ruling families for many tribes and nationsalong and beyond the eastern Mediterranean coast. In the Annals of Irish History the Scythian “Tuadha d’Anu”, who had migratedfarther still, to the islands of the north, were described as a tribe of deificqueens, kings, princes and lords, and were noted for having Druids of their own.In Japan's northern islands, there lives a shamanic tribe called the Ainu whoseearly writing style has been identified as being Gaelic Ogham! The Aryan-Scythian horse lords were a noble tribe, a sept of the Aryan peopleswho, during various migrations, had also wandered east several centuries beforethe d'Anu displacement. On their reputed first journey to Eire in 1500 BC, they,were described by their contemporaries as being highly feminine and flamboyant.They travelled south-east via Persia (Iran) from 1800 BC onwards, and hadentered the Indus Valley and intermingled with the Dravidian population. This migration was to lands already formerly under Sumerian and consequentlyUbaid control. The westward migration of the Scythians or Sidheans also includedthese very same Dravidians who, so British traditions state, were the messengersand summoners or “fetches” of the Merlins. These curious and delightful beingswere also known as brownies, for obvious reasons, and adopted the habit of bodytattooing in emulation of their Scythian lords, who in Britain and Ireland wereknown as the Pixies, which is a name derived from Pict-Sidhes or paintedFairies. The confusion which arises when the Picts are described as being short and brownmay be clarified when we remember that the Scythian caste system consisted ofthree closely interknit, co-operating races. Their traditions and practiceswould inevitably become, to a certain extent, common to all within the system bya natural process of social osmosis. From this encounter arose the eastern branch of the Aryan, Vedic “Hindu”religion, with its Druids or magi—the Brahmins—and a pantheon of gods who werevirtually identical with the Sumerian, Egyptian, Hittite, Irish, Gaulish, Danishand Greek. All of them stem from this early family of Elven goddess-queens andgod-kings whose first home was to be found in the Balkans, Transylvania,Carpathia and the Caucasus regions of Greater and Little Scythia. Within the Brahmin caste, special Tantric rites were and still are studied andpractised. Evidence suggests that these ancient rites were brought to India fromSumeria. This accords with the assertion that Qabalah itself originated thereand the author has long maintained that Tantra, particularly the Kaula Vama Margand Esoteric Qabalism are simply variations of each other. The Tree of Lifesymbol and its hidden meanings appear in Druidism. Given the evidence to date,we can confidently say that Tantra and Qabalah are descended from ancient UbaidDruidic philosophy. The right hand path version of Hindu and Buddhist Tantra concerns itself withstudying and practising sexual rites that one might find associated with theKama Sutra. This form of Tantra promotes penetrative intercourse as a method ofchanging consciousness and has, attached to it, various commentaries onright-living and right-thinking. This was thought by some Indian scholars tohave originated with those who were depicted by one sub-continental academic asthe over-sexed Dravidians. The left hand path however is somewhat different. This discipline can be found in both Hinduism and Buddhism and concerns itselfwith the practice of vampirism. This alone is sufficient evidence to allow oneto ascertain that the “Black” or Left Hand or Kaula Path preceded the laterright hand path which, though joyously tactile and self indulgent to begin with,appears many centuries later to have been somewhat sanitised for publicconsumption. The yogic disciplines associated with the Kaula Path, originatingwith the Scythians, are intended to lead the practitioner to what one might call“union with godhead”. This psychological condition is manifest in mystical Christianity as being theperception by the devotee of “the kingdom of heaven”. That few Christians everachieve such a state is not to be wondered at, as Christianity is also a royalblood tradition, exactly like its brother and sister, Druidism and Witchcraft. Many Christians are ignorant of this aspect of Jesus' teaching and are in anycase not encouraged to explore its possibilities because such union leads tophysical and psychological freedom. This is the very last thing that theestablished Churches wish to encourage in the masses, even though Jesus himselfpreached it. Union with Godhead, dwelling in Elphame, realisation of the Buddha or whateverone likes to call it is accompanied by a range of powers which were cataloguedby the amazing Edwardian lady explorer Alexandra David-Neel. She witnessed theperformance of these remarkable powers or Siddhis by Buddhist monks in Nepal andTibet, whose ritual and philosophy owed much to the indigenous religion Bon-Po,which ethically followed the same path as Kaula Vama Marg. In the west we call it magic but, as we have seen, it was also known as theSidhe. Kaula Tantra is dedicated to the Goddess Kali who is associated with bothcreation and destruction in the Hindu pantheon. Kali is a lunar deity who, likeTantra itself, moved east from Sumeria. As a moon goddess she is associatedparticularly with moon blood and the essences of the female organs ofgeneration. So what can we say of the nascence of Vampirism so far? Principally that itoriginated, not surprisingly, in Transylvania and the Central Eurasian regionknown as Scythia and that its practitioners were of a distinct race, the Elves,the high goddess-queens and god-kings of the Arya or Aesir. Vampirism was the central feature of a philosophy based on endocrinology, ratherthan occult mumbo-jumbo, and used the consumption of female blood and mumae toenhance awareness and lead the practitioner to union with godhead. The powersaccompanying such an elevated state of consciousness were called the sidhe orsiddhi and were, with vampirism, the foundation of the cults of Druidism,Tantric Kaula Yoga, Qabalism, Alchemy, Rosicrucianism and Witchcraft. Kali, like all the Ubaid deities, was a flesh and blood being. She, Kalimaath orKali Marg, was a daughter of Lilith and Samael, son of Anu, who appears in theAryan pantheon as Ahura Mazda and in Iran as the Medean god Zoroaster. Anuhimself was the god who gave his name to the Tuatha de Danaan and, as Sitchinhas suggested, the definition of the word god itself is “descended of Anu”.Based on the spelling of “Tuatha de Danaan”, some have suggested that theseIrish Elven folk derived their name from an Irish mother goddess named Dana. Ifthey had checked the earlier spelling—Tuadha d'Anu (Tribe of Anu)—they wouldhave discovered that the Scythian Sidhe were the sons and daughters of Anu andthe Ubaid gods and goddesses. To recap, we have a clear connection between the words siddhi and sidhe, both ofwhich originate from a Scythian or earlier proto-Aryan-Ubaid root. TheScythians, as the Aryans of Persia and Asia, provided the people then with theirreligious and social structures and spread their wisdom and overlordship, mostlyby invitation from prospective client tribes, throughout Britain and Europe. The Scythian Aryans, as the “Danaan”, settled in Eire and Scotland, whilst inWales they were known as the House of Don (Dan) or the House of Gwynnedd. Thishouse sired the line of Llewelyn Princes, whilst in Scandinavia the Danaanbecame the Danes or Vikings and produced a junior cousin line—the Svei orSwedes—from which descended the Ruotsi clan that founded Russia. In Denmark theSidhe was present as the Siddir, a class of seer or Witch which was laterseparated from the Godthi or Gothi, the Danish Druids. The Scythian Danaan in Eire, as in the rest of Europe, were a race apart, aruling caste within which, like the original race of the Gods from whom theydescended, there were further caste classifications. In Denmark these were later named the Jarl, Carl and Thrall castes whilst inEire they were broadly speaking of the Druids, the Kings and the Warrior Smiths.In India they are still defined as the Brahmins, the Ksatriyas and the Sudras. The original castes of the Gods were a) the common gods—gods of Earth; b) thegods of Heaven and Earth and c) the gods of Heaven. The first class was what wemight call jobbing gods who became the genii locus or pagan spirits. The secondclass—the gods of Heaven and Earth—was the Titans, the Repha'im and Morrigans,the Angels and Valkiries who interceded between the transcended gods, the divineancestors—the gods of Heaven—and man. Heaven was the Otherworld. Not a place up in the stars, but a state of beingwhich was adjacent to our own dimension. It was most competently described, morethan once, in the Mabinogion, as the Mirrorworld. It could be entered and leftfreely by the gods of Heaven and Earth, the Portal Guardians. In this place,also known as Elphame, Hades, Hel, Caer Glas and Tir Na n'og, there dwelt theessences of the previous gods of Heaven and Earth who had passed on to becomethe transcended ones, the “antecessors” or ancestors of the later Witches. Bydwelling in tombs, the gods of Heaven and Earth, the Danaan Queens and Kings,made contact with their ancestor Gods and passed their wisdom and edicts on tomankind. Today we might call this process invocation. These gods are carried in the blood and by invocation. We bring their qualitiesand identities to the forefront of conscious being and give them voice. TheseDruidic gods and goddesses of Heaven and Earth were effectively the highestoverlords on Earth, the Elven rulers of the human kings and queens who ruledbeneath them. Often we find mention of the Fairy blood in the medieval era in connection withthe ruling nobility of the time. We might then be tempted to come to the logicalconclusion that all nobility and royalty was thus of Fairy origin. This issimply not the case. Despite the usurpation of the original Fairy families bythe Church sponsored new nobility, the previous kingly and noble dynasties wereessentially human anyway. The Fairy blood at that time, the dark ages and the medieval period, was carriedby the descendants of the Archdruidic dynasties who formerly ruled over thecontemporary Celtic and Eurasian kings and lords. It was not carried by any orall of the royal or noble families of the time simply by virtue of the fact thatthey were the heads of their castes. The castes of the Elven godkings themselveswere positioned directly over such class distinctions. The gods of Heaven and Earth—the Archdruidic caste—dwelt in Barrows and Bergswhich in Eire were called raths. The word Rath means a “royal seat”. These rathswere the holy shrines and sepulchres built by the Danaan— the original Gods ofIreland according to the Annals of Irish History—to house the mortal remains oftheir ancestors and act as royal palaces for the Portal Guardians. In specificcases these Gods are named, and we learn, for instance, that Newgrange was theshrine occupied by Nuadha and later Oengus. The devotional and holy nature of these places has led some scholars andcommentators to believe that, because they were tombs and temples, those said tooccupy them must be purely spiritual entities, gods of an ethereal nature.Originally nothing could have been farther from the truth. Both Nuadha andOengus were kings of the Danaan and contemporary descriptions of them and theirkin leave us with the picture of the Danaan as a race of people with prodigiousand very earthly appetites. From their kinsmen in Siberia we know that, by our dubious standards, they werecomplete junkies and imbibed any form of drug they could get hold of. Thesewould have included cannabis and cocaine, prevalent in Egypt and the Levant atthe time, as well as the drugs classically associated with the Druids and theElves, such as Amanita Muscaria and Psylocybin, the Fairy mushrooms ofchildren's picture books everywhere. The Danaan were hardened drinkers and unscrupulous womanisers, whilst accountsof their princesses relate that they often mated in public with the highestnobles of their clan, to prove or reiterate their social standing to onlookers.(Heroditus: The Histories) Counterbalancing this view of them, born of our own hypocritical conditioning,the Danaan, whether in Eire or mainland Europe or Asia, were the finest smiths,jewellers, poets and musicians of their time. They were the Lords of fearlesswarriors and gifted horsemen and, despite what we might think of the foregoing,they were a righteous, meticulous people who maintained standards of conduct inareas of their social life where such standards were considered essential forthe harmonious order of society. Great emphasis was laid upon honesty and truth in one's words and one'sdealings. The maintenance and conservation of the natural environment wasparamount, and infractions, such as the cutting of trees, could mean death.Emphasis was also laid on hospitality and courtly behaviour to one's peers orguests, the honouring of one's ancestors and heroes, and the maintenance ofextended family ties through fostering. Although unaffected by the petty morality with which we view our sexualbehaviour, they would kill a man for breaking his word or lying. They were anheroic people. Compared with us today, they were a far more moral race whosestandards of conduct, not invested or centred on our kind of childish taboos—butplaced where it matters—puts us to shame. They were a race centred on their spirituality which itself was centred ongnosis and transcendent consciousness. This made them, like their later royalViking cousins, a fearless people much loved and also much feared in turns, byall who knew them, whether in Eurasia or the British islands. In about 500 BC, the Milesians entered Ireland from Iberia. Having defeated theDanaan tribes they put many of them to flight. It was during this period thatthe Danaan became known as the Daouine Sidhe—the people of the hills—anerroneous use of the word sidhe. One group, the tribe of the Danaan king of Ulster, Bruidhne (mistakenly calledCruithne by the Romans), fled to Caledonia where they became known as theremnant of Cruithne or the “Cruithainn”. Other Danaan clans fled to Wales andthe southwest of mainland Britain. Several centuries later, when the Romans wereunfortunate enough to encounter them in Scotland, they referred to these Danaanas “Picts”. It is this word that has adapted itself to become one of the nameswe use to describe the Elven peoples—the pixies— or properly the Pict-Sidhes aswe have already seen. These beings also came to be known as the Leprechauns and the etymology of thisword, though thought to mean “small-bodied” actually means “scaly-bodied” fromthe Latin word lepra as in leprosy—scaly skinned. The scaliness referred to was derived from the fish-scale style of armour whichwas common to the draconian Dacians, the Zmei, the Danes and the Danaan, all ofwhom originated in the region now known as Greater Scythia. The scaly, twin-pronged tail of the wouivre or mermaid was also derived from theuse, by grail maidens, of fish-scale plated leggings. When worn with the Swan'sor Raven's feather cloaks, we have the classical image of the Harpie, reproducedin medieval depictions of Melusine. Pict or Pictish means “painted” and the Danaan earned this appellation by virtueof their use of tattoos or woad to decorate their bodies with totemic or magicalmarkings, the favourite being the labyrinth or spiral whorl. The ancestors of the Irish Danaan—the UbaidDanaan—had been using tattoos andwoad since 4000 BC. Examples of it can also be found in depictions of theEgyptian god Osiris or Asher as he is also known, and in the depictions of theHindu gods Vishnu and Siva. Kali herself was also known as Kali Azura—the BlueKali. The spiral or whorl—the labyrinth—is the subject of a later essay in which itand its painted or carved symbol, lie at the centre of Vampire and Elventradition. The spiral can be found carved into the rock at Newgrange in Irelandand also featured as a sacred design associated with the dwellings of therelated Kassite Danaan clans who migrated to Britain. In the Gaelic language we find two words specifically defining “Vampires”. Thefirst—Creachaire—means a sepulchre, a tomb, a shrine and a temple, indicatingthat the character we later become familiar with as the “Vampire” of Gothiclegend was in fact a “dweller in the tombs”, a Druidic priest-king orpriestess-queen—an Uber or Witch Overlord. In Eurasia, particularly in the permafrost of Siberia and the arid wastes ofTakla Makan in China, the mummified bodies of Scythian Chieftains and Shamankasor Priestess queens have been found. In Siberia the frozen remains of a malewere unearthed. He had been tattooed with animal designs reminiscent of thetotem Pictish salmon often found carved on stones in Scotland. In the same region a shamanka had been unearthed who had been tattooed with thespiral labyrinth design. She, like her counterpart in Takla Makan, wore theconical headdress of the Anunnaki gods of Sumeria that is also associated withmedieval Witchcraft. This same headdress is depicted in basrelief on the wallsof the palace of Darius as being worn by those Scythians who brought him giftsin 500 BC. The Takla Makan mummy, excavated by the Chinese in the 1960s, had red-gold hairand was buried adjacent to a cache of tartan plaid cloth and spiral paintedpottery, similar to that found at Al'Ubaid in Syria. In the same region, caveshave been discovered where the walls are painted with devotional Buddhistpictures featuring the Tocharians, as they are known, conversing with Buddha. Geoffrey Ashe states that the western Druids were interviewed by Buddha. Heclaimed that they, the Druids, had established Shangri-La in the west. Thisshould give the reader some hint as to the general thrust of Druidic philosophyand of the hidden nature of that promoted by Jesus, whom St. Columbus clearlystated was also a Druid and Magus himself. "},{"pageContent":"[images/00077.jpg] Chapter 3 Scythians and Druids The Tocharians, depicted in the cave shrines of Takla Makan, are red haired,like the Merovingians, and wear the same conical hat, sometimes called aPhrygian cap. A variant of this was worn by Mithras, the intermediary godadopted by the Persians and featured in the Indian pantheon of the Asuras. Inmonarchical Dualism he is depicted as balancing the forces of increase anddecrease, represented by the gods Ahura Mazda and Ahriman. Some classicalauthors identified him with Jesus Christ. His headgear is also depicted as thehat worn by gnomes and dwarves. Accompanying the depictions of the Tocharian Lords in these cave temples areexamples of the language attributed to them—Tocharian “A” script—which looksremarkably like one of the scripts that Tolkien attributes to his Elven peoples.Like Tolkein’s Elven language, it is a Gaelic tongue influenced by Finno Ugaric.That the Tocharians are Scythian-Aryans themselves means that the devotionallanguage used by their High-Kings and Queens might justifiably be called anElven language, the tongue of Tolkien's Sundered Elves of the East. The second Gaelic word for “Vampire” is Sumaire, which is pronounced shimarie,with the accent on the middle syllable—shim AR ri. Sumaire is translated as“vortex”, meaning a whirlpool or spiral, a labyrinth: a sucker, a reptile(serpent or Dragon). There is a clear link here with Sumeria and Anu's mother Tiamat, the Dragonessof the deeps, and with Anu's children Samael and Lilith, the forebears of theFairies. Various pictures of the latter two depict them as entwined around atree. Often the tree is Lilith herself, with Samael as the serpent or Dragonresting in her branches as in Hebraic Iconography where Lilith is the Tree ofKnowledge in the Garden of Eden. The Sumerians appeared first in Mesopotamia in3500 BC. Prior to their emergence they were preceded by the Ubaidmigrants fromwhat is now southern Romania, and from Carpathia and Scythia. They had fledsouth to escape the Black Sea flood of 4000 BC. Archaeologists working inTartaria in the Ubaid territory of Transylvania discovered a “tepes” or Rathunder which they found a fire-pit dated to about 5000 BC. Buried amongst theashes were the human remains of a cannibalistic sacrificial victim and two claytablets. On these were inscribed the name of Enki (Samael), the number ofAnu—60—and the image of a goat, Enki again, and a Tree—Lilith. The pictographicnature of the inscriptions convinced the archaeologists that the language wasthe forerunner of Sumerian and so they called it proto-Sumerian. This made itfairly obvious that the first Sumerians were originally Ubaid Overlords fromCentral Eurasia. Tocharian LordsSadly however, a group of right-wing Hungarian nationalists then claimedSumerian roots by virtue of a spurious discovery they claimed to have made,subsequent to the discovery in the 1960's. Following this claim, no academicwould validate the proto-Sumerian theory. Quite rightly, they had no desire toaccommodate the views of a neo-nazi group. It is unclear what a group of Mongoloids thought they had in common with theAryan race. Having invaded the region as the Magyar at so late a period inhistory it is impossible to see how any claim to Sumerian or protoSumerianorigins could possibly hold up under even the most cursory scrutiny.Nevertheless the attitude of those academics who opposed the definition wasobstructive and misleading. This is especially so as it is now conclusivelyproved that the culture responsible for the production of the Tartarian claytablets and the Rath structure was Ubaid—the founders of civilised Mesopotamia.As it turns out, they were also the Overlords of the Indus valley civilisationof Mohenjo Daro and Harrapa where Ishtar reigned as Queen. Further east of Transylvania similar discoveries were made in the Ukraine orgreater Scythia and the peoples who had settled the area were named after theirdwellings, which in Russian were called Kurgans. They were mound houses ofexactly the same style as the tepes of Tartaria and the Tells that the Ubaidbuilt all the way down through Anatolia to Al'Ubaid and Sumeria. The invention of the chariot was attributed to the Kurgan peoples, clearly thered-haired Aryan or proto-Aryan (if you must) horse lords. The axle dimensionsof the chariot were copied on all horse drawn vehicles right up until theVictorian period, when they were incorporated into the axle width (4 ft. 8 in.)of the standard gauge railways still in use today. The influence that Vampireshave had on European culture should not be dismissed! They inspired modernwheeled transport, invented large-scale tourism, and lent their images and theirkilts to the lids of every shortbread tin you've ever seen. It seems fair to suggest, given the wealth of archaeological and anthropologicalevidence, that the Sumerians or Ubaid as we should call them, along with thepale-skinned and red-haired Lilith and her descendants, were the early Elven,Aryan-Scythian Dragon Overlords of what we know now as Transylvania and GreaterScythia. This is particularly clear in the light of the discoveries of bat-winged, serpent-god statuary found in Dacia and Tibet (not too far fromTakla Makan!) which is said to date back at least 5000 years, putting it intothe period of the emergence of civilisation in Sumeria. Such figures we would readily identify as the Dragon or, in Gaelic—TheSumaire—whilst the Kurgans/Tells/Tepes that these early Transylvanian/ScythianSidheans or Ubaid occupied were clearly duplicated in the Irish raths of theDanaan, such as Newgrange with its spirally engraved stones, the Zigurrats ofthe Sumerians, and the Pyramids of the Egyptians. Whilst these ancient structures bore the marks of the Sumaire, the spirallabyrinth or vortex design, thus emphasising the creachaire—sumaire theme of theDragon—Witch—Vampire—Overlord theme, the Egyptians too adopted the labyrinth andused the spiral as a hieroglyph which they termed the “Mer”. This was a symbolof irrigation associating it with water and, via “weir” spelt Vere and Mhaior,rendering Muir, returning once more to the Egyptian Mer—the fish trap orfish-woman trap, the enclosure of the mermaid, the maze or labyrinth andintimations of the wild hunt. (Muir and Mhaior name variants courtesy of Dr.Hugh Vere.) So at long last, having trudged through the backwaters of obscure knowledge, wecan now say that we know exactly who and what the Vampire was and is. A veryrare individual, a God-King amongst the race of human kings, the Vampiredescends from the supernatural Dragon Royalty of Sumeria back to the UbaidOverlords of what was to become known as Transylvania and Greater Scythia. The Vampire: the Dragon King or Queen was an Archdruid, a Witch Queen or King, aFairy Princess or Prince amongst the race of Elphame. Consequently the Vampire,the Fairy, the Dragon and the Witch were all the same individual. Far from beingthe characters of fable they were in fact very powerful, very real beings whoseVampiric natures and rituals sustained their superconsciousness and transcendentvision which, in its turn, maintained their positions as the overlords ofmankind. These gods of flesh and blood were the only gods that ever actually existed:myth, however, transformed them into the ethereal deities whom we areconditioned to think of as Gods now, and who came to be worshipped worldwide.Nevertheless, flesh and blood they were and their bloodlines descend to thepresent day. The DruidsThe word Druid is said to be Greek in origin, as “drys”: means “tree”. Someauthorities like to think it means “oak tree” but no evidence exists to confirmthis irrefutably. As we shall see later, Druid is also related to “dru” meaning“run” in Sanskrit and to Drys meaning a Wren—specifically the Goldcrest—one ofthe birds most sacred to the Druids. For the present however, we willconcentrate on the Greek version of the word. The Druids are associated with groves and, as some will insist, with oak trees.However, it is feasible to suggest that in the light of their Sumerian andUbaidorigins, the Druids as priest kings of the Dragon, were connectedspecifically with the Tree of Life and the Tree of Knowledge, rather than withany mundane or temporal shrubbery. Accepting this we may further suggest that, as priests of these pre-eminentTrees of Life and Knowledge, they may be further identified with those magiciansand scholars whose Transylvanian descendants were the Scythian Aryans orSumerian Anunnaki—the Dragon God-Kings. They were instrumental in establishingthe Chakric system of Hindu and Buddhist Tantra and Hebrew, Arabic and GreekQabalah whose magical systems, as we all know, contain a glyph called the Treeof Life. Generally speaking this Tree is a system of pathways both macrocosmic andmicrocosmic in nature. It links the various subtle energy centres which are saidto exist both in the universe, as levels of density and emanation relating tothe manifestation of cosmic power and being, and in the human body—on themicrocosmic level—as energy centres corresponding to the glands in theendocrinal system. In Qabalah the spheres which do not relate to the glands maybe seen as points in the meridian system adopted by the Chinese. On anotherlevel, the Qabalistic Tree of Life is a genealogical chart of the Gods. The magical Tree is a universal symbol. As in the early Sumerian depiction ofthe Tree of Life; the abode of Lilith, many of the subsequent Arabic, Indian andEuropean Holy Trees share common attributes. All have residing in their topmostbranches some form of bird. In Tantra it is the Swan, whose head rests within the Ajna Chakra whichcorresponds to the pineal and pituitary glands and the corpus callosum. In WelshDruidic lore the bird is represented as the eagle, a typically shamanic, totembird which symbolises the ascendant spirit. Here the eagle is the god Lleu (inIrelandhe is the Danaan king Lugh), the father of the Elven Llewelyn Kings ofGwynnedd. In Arabic Sufism the bird is a peacock, whilst in Viking lore theSacred Tree Yggdrasil has at its base a coiled serpent by a pool and in itshighest boughs the bird of the released spirit accompanied by a white hart. What a deer is doing up a tree is anyone's guess, but use your imagination forthe time being. Yggdrasil is called the Axis Mundi and is seen as the tree whichcontains within its branches and roots the nine worlds of the Vikingphilosophical system, including their version of the Hebrew Qlipphoth orunderworld. Immediately the similarity between it and the Qabalistic and TantricTrees becomes quite apparent. This is no fluke. In actual fact the Druids’ most sacred tree was not the oak. It was the appletree, and linked to it is the blue boar, both of which came originally, it wassaid, from the Otherworld. For this reason the Tree of Knowledge in the Gardenof Eden was always depicted as the apple, but could be interchanged with thepomegranate for reasons which will eventually become apparent. The Mistletoe Bard, whom we will encounter later, cut the golden bough from theApple prior to descending into the underworld. It has been suggested that theberries of the mistletoe represent the sperm of the Great Oak God(Jupiter/Thor/Jehovah/Enlil) and thus his fertility and lifeforce, but this isnot in fact the case. The Mistletoe grew mainly on Apple trees which, as we shall see, are exclusivelyfemale. Therefore the berries of the Mistletoe represent the female andconsequently the Goddess' fluid. Not the seminal fluid of a male deity. The boar is sacred to both Mars and to Arduina or Diana. This link between theapple and the boar; and the boar and Mars and Diana or the Moon is identicalwith the association between the Apple Tree of Eden as Lilith (of the Moon) andSamael, the Serpent or Dragon, who embraces her. Essentially the symbols of theBoar and the Dragon have become interchangeable. The Blue Boar is a Druidic symbol of office and the Dragon is a symbol ofbloodline descent, a clan badge of the Druidic race. In the Scythian DragonTribe, the individual totem animal badges vary from region to region and reflectthe local fauna and the status of the clan or sept. As an example, a high orArchdruidic family badge would be the boar, whilst a junior sept of that clannadwould have as its totem the hedgehog, which is rather amusing. The symbol of Samael the Serpent reclining in the Branches of Lilith's AppleTree in the Garden of Eden actually depicts the concept of the Dragon eating thefruit itself. This can also be found slightly more abstractly but conversely andparadoxically more graphically at the same time, in the Tantric equivalent ofthe serpent entwined around a female figure. As the apple is also the favourite fruit of the boar in the wild, it isdoubtless that the adoption of the Boar as a badge was because of this.Furthermore, the identification of the boar with the Dragon was through theirmutual, actual and symbolic love of what the Irish Druids called the apples ofred-gold. The boar was also called Le Solitaire and for this reason has linkswith the Merlin which will be dealt with later. The Apple Trees—either Lilith or her descendant scarlet priestesses— bore thefruit which symbolised the Sephira and the glands of the female body. These, theapples of red-gold, produce the enriched virginal womb blood that was consumedby both the male and female Druids—the Boars in the Orchard and the Serpents orDragons in the Trees. Red-Gold is also the Tantric Kaula term for womb blood:the Rtu or first flow of the womb. In reinforcing the Uber-Oupire link—the identification between the Witch(Druidhe) and Vampire—it is worth taking a look at the totem system ofMithraism, a close cousin of Druidism. In the Mithraic initiatory grades thereare 7 degrees. The Highest is the Dragon and the penultimate is the wolf. Also included is theRaven. With variations across Europe these animals, along with Swans, Geese,Bears, Vipers, Hawks, Eagles and so on, served as the tuadh or kingdom emblemsfor the various Scythian groups. In Romania however, these grades with their animal totems or badges make up thedegrees or conditions of vampirism. The most potent Vampire is the Dracoi orfemale Dracoica, from whence the House of Drakul obtained its name, meaning“Satan” or “Dragon”, whilst Drakulea or Dracula means “son of Satan” or “son ofthe Dragon”. Lying at a close second place comes the Stregoi or femaleStregoica, a being that manifests itself as either a wolf or a Raven. We can seewhere this is leading, can't we? The Stregoi or Stregoica represents both the Morrigan or Morgana, the Valkirieand the Werewolf or Verewolf, which is simply another manifestation of theVampire. Typically and especially where wolves were scarce, the werewolf wasrepresented variously by the bear and the fox; and elsewhere by the crocodile(the Sobekh of Egypt—patron and protector of Royalty— whose fat was used as theMessach or anointing oil of the Pharaohs, the Messiahs or priest kings). In this area of the world it was also common to replace the werewolf with thePanther, who was sacred to the lunar goddess Diana and also to Bacchus. Pantherwas the clan name of Jesus, and much earlier, the Ubaid priests wore the skinsof Panthers as their totem animal. The Panther's feeding ritual involves itopening the jugular vein in its victim’s neck, and drinking the blood prior toeating the carcass. The association between werewolves and the moonlight which drove them “loopy”,according to fable, is repeated and reinforced by the traditional belief thatWitches (also known as Vampires) were sacred to Diana and worshipped her by thelight of the full moon. The link between the full moon and the Vampire of theGothic Romance is also well represented in tradition. The reason that moonlight drove werewolves mad and elicited devotion fromWitches was because the full moon was seen as the menstrual moon that signalledthe impending flow. It was worshipped particularly by the Witches of Italy andthe surrounding area. These ladies were called Strega, that is the Italian namefor a Witch. Rather than worshipping the full moon they were celebrating whatthe moon and Diana stood for—food for the soul—the blood of virgins! Give it achance—it isn't as gory or unsavoury as it sounds. This was the secret foundation for the High Romance and Courtly Love thatinitiated the exoteric Medieval Romantic Movement itself, so don't getjudgmental or picky. According to an eminent Professor of Sexual Medicine, ifyou are health conscious and take supplements like HRT you should know that itcomes, in many cases, from the urine of either mares or French nuns. Melatonin was the primary hormone extracted in the blood rites of Diana, so it'syour choice. Would you have preferred the blood of beautiful virgins,romantically celebrating and giving joyously of their feminine power and statusby moonlight, or the urine of papists—in a pill? One type of melatonin is livewhilst the other is stone dead and useless—guess which is which. And melatoninis only the beginning of the story. Others included oxytocin, prolactin, seratonin, adenosine triphosphate,dopamine, telomerase and retinol. Richard Dufton has also been workingindependently on identifying the same chemical presences for some years. When heand the author met in 1995 they began to work closely on the melatonin basis forthe Holy Grail. Out of this joint research the author discovered the widerimplications of the discovery and restructured the Kabalistic and Tantricsystems with precise chemical indices for each sephiroth or chakra. The association between Scythian Totem beasts, Romanian animal Vampire types andMithraic grades of Initiation indicates clearly that vampirism, far from beingrandom or opportunist, was in fact part of an ancient system of Elven ritesmanifest in Tantra, Mithraism and Druidism. Having said that, the symbols of the panther and the werewolf were apposite, asthe Scythian warrior nobility were literally bloodthirsty at times. Romanreports from the early part of the first millennium state how the Pictish Danaanhad been witnessed eating the flesh and drinking the blood of their defeatedfoes following victories in battle. Undoubtedly this was a corruption of earlier ritual practice as we shall seelater. Certainly going out and “eating Italian” had a unique and disturbingmeaning for the Roman soldiery of the day, as the Ninth Legion in Albanydiscovered to their cost. Drinking the blood of friend or foe in battle was acommon practice in Eire and Scotland, the former in remembrance of fallencomrades, the latter to obtain the strength of the enemy. Contrary to RoyalVampirism, the whole point of Martial Vampirism was to clog your arteries withsomeone else’s adrenaline. Another ritual familiar to those who have read Bram Stoker's Dracula was thehauling of soil from the Scythian homelands in boxes. The Scythians initiatedthis practice with the idea that the earth was the source of sovereignty andpower and that one’s soul was linked to one’s homeland. This should not be dismissed outright, as we are what we eat. What we eataffects the “soul” (the biochemically derived and mediated collection ofresponses and attachments called “ME”, the ego, personality or whatever,dependant for its existence on the continuity of the mind-brain interface)through the body, as both body and soul are inextricably linked. What we eatcomes from the land where we are born and thus the soil of one’s country and itsinherent sovereignty and identity literally flow in the blood that coursesthrough one's veins. Up until the 19th century, the displaced Scots who travelled to America wouldslip a little soil from their former crofts into the soles of their boots inorder that, wherever they went they would always be walking on the earth oftheir homeland. The Scythian Overlords brought the Dragon culture with them as they traversedthe many regions of Europe and finally settled in the British Isles. All theirkings, indeed all Scythians of the royal caste were Dragons, particularly theDruids. Their high kings were called PenDragons or chief Dragons and were pickedby their Druidic peers from Druidic families. Variant spellings for the name Druid include “Draoi”—thought to meanDragon—which is close in spelling to the Romanian “Dracoi” and “Dracoica”. Ifrelated to “Drys”, it is associated with wood nymphs or tree spirits. Thissuggests that the “Drys” or “Dryads” were the female Druids who were symbolisedby the apple tree of Lilith whilst the “Draoi” or “Dracoi”—the highest degree ofthe male Druids—were represented by the serpent entwined in the branches ofthose apple trees. The Priestess Queens and Priest Kings, as we have seen, dwelt in the holyplaces, the royal raths that served as both temple and tomb. These subterraneanpalaces mimicked the bergs or mound houses of the Scythians' “proto”-Sumerianancestors, who originated in Transylvania and Carpathia. Similarly the Mithraic underground temples resembled places like Newgrange, inthat they had an aperture above the doorway that allowed a shaft of sunlightinto the building. This ray would hit the back wall of the temple where, in thecase of Mithraic rituals, there were placed figurines, the sequentialillumination of each in its turn, as the day progressed onwards, would tell aninitiatory story, bathed in the dying light of the midwinter sun. Beneath the doorways of some of these buildings have been discovered the remainsof headless corpses whose skulls would have been secreted within these SidheMounds. Their functions were to serve as Guardians of the Portals, spiritdefenders of the power and sanctity of these shrines—the dwellings of theDragons—the Goddess-Queens and God-Kings incarnate. The cult of the severed head, as part of Celtic religious practice, originatedwith the Druids, and therefore the Scythians. Examples of the head as the seatof the soul and the source of mystical wisdom, a bestower of gifts or cornucopiafinds expression both in the legend of the head of Bran the Blessed or BendigaidFran, Archdruid of Britain. This is retold in the Mabinogion; and the Trialpapers of the Templars, who owned a head which was said to speak words oftranscendent wisdom. This head, along with that of Bran, have both been cited asbeing aspects of the Grail with whom both Bran and the Templars were connected. The Knights Templar, restructured by Baldwin of Bourcq in 1118, appended totheir name “and of the Temple of Solomon” whilst the members of the originalOrder of Templars, a Vere foundation which emerged in 1100, were called“Guardian Princes of the Royal Secret”. However the original Temple Guard wasfounded 1500 years earlier in Jerusalem. A close examination of the Song of Songs attributed to Solomon will reveal tothe reader certain esoteric references to the Grail. It has been furtherrevealed that Solomon's bloodline had Scythian Dragon origins and thereforeconnections with the Cult of the Head. That a head, said to be that of theMagdalene, successor to Sheba, turned up in the inventory attached to theTemplar trial papers should therefore come as no surprise. The Scythiansbelieved that the head contained the immortal soul. Descartes, writing in the 1600's, was of the same opinion and elaborated thetheory by asserting that the seat of the soul was the pineal gland. Others,writing later, have suggested that this organ is the mediator of inspiration andthe translator of intuitive or cosmic information. In Indian Tantric Yoga the pineal is the physical seat or anchor of the AjnaChakra which also corresponds to the pituitary. In this philosophy the Pineal issymbolised as being the head of the Swan, whose body comprises the various areasof the rest of the brain. As we have seen, the Dove and the Raven also fulfilthis symbolic function. The pineal gland is specifically associated with Grail Lore and closely aspectedto manifestations of the Grail in the forms of a cup, a stone, a cauldron, awell, mere or lake; a fountain, (such as that found in certain qabalisticrituals) and an underground stream. Within the theme of the severed head we also find the dressed head of Llewelyn,King of Gwynedd, which was severed from his body and garlanded with Ivy (sacredto Bacchus) before being dispatched to Edward I following the victory of hisarmies over the Welsh in the 1200's. "},{"pageContent":" Some two hundred years later, on his death in 1477, Prince Vlad Draculea's bodywas taken to an Abbey he had built on an island in the middle of a lake inSmyrna in what is now the Republic of Romania. Such a sanctuary has distinctArthurian overtones and associations with the Isle of Avalon, upon which therewas also built an abbey of the quasi-Druidic CeltoScythian Church. This replaced the early Rath temple, grove and sanctuary of the Morganas, theladies of the lake who were the Swan Maiden-Valkiries of the Scythian world,Vampires and head hunters. In such sanctuaries headless corpses, as we haveseen, were placed as portal guardians. It is in just such a condition that wediscover that, according to local tradition, Draculea's head was removed fromhis body and his corpse was buried beneath the stone flags beneath the doorwayof the Abbey's chapel. A similar incident is reported to have occurred with the establishment of theCeltic Christian Shrine on the Island of Iona. Here it is St. Columba who issaid to have severed the head of one of his disciples and buried the blooddrained corpse beneath the doorway of the chapel. The blood of the victim wasthen consumed as a Eucharist in thanksgiving for the monks' safe arrival to theisland. Here we can see that early Christianity was indeed tied up with the cultof the head, as was the collateral Johannite Cult of the Baptist, who himselfwas a sacrificial king of Dragon descent. As we have seen, Draculea's name means son of the Dragon, and his burialreplicates the Scythian burials in the Holy-Royal Sidhe or power mounds found inEire and Scotland. In Draculea's case there are a number of symbols associatedwith him that connect him directly with the Scythian Druidic tradition.Furthermore these symbols, some of which we obtain, surprisingly enough, fromStoker's novel, lead to the conclusion that Stoker knew a great deal about hissubject. Much of the information in Dracula the novel is of an esoteric andhighly specialised psycho-biological nature, which does not detract from orconflict with, but rather elucidates upon, the character of the Draculea ofhistory. Bram Stoker was a close friend and associate of the Welsh magician and writerArthur Machen who wrote numerous works, including a paper on the alchemicalsignificance of the Dragon and a novel on the Twllyth Teg—the Fairies of Wales. It is a common device to convey esoteric knowledge via the medium of supposedfiction and it appears that both Stoker and Machen involved themselves in suchventures. Stoker was also acquainted with Aleister Crowley and MacGregorMathers, both of whom were leading lights in the Hermetic Order of the GoldenDawn. Machen and Oscar Wilde were members of this organisation which, it issaid, had its roots in the ancient Rosicruciana Anglicae. Oscar Wilde was one of only four people associated with The Golden Dawn and thelater breakaway group: the Ordo Templi Orientis headed by Crowley, who himselfundertook to perform the rituals leading to the accomplishment of a variant ofthe ancient “Mass of the Vampire”. The amazing Jack Parsons OTO, attempted it in the 1940's and joined Wilde insuccumbing to the ruin and degradation that accompanies it. Jack died in aninexplicable explosion in the garage of his home in California. Whilst Crowley accomplished the rite and walked away virtually unscathed,eventually dying of old age in Hastings, Wilde's fate is known to all. Havingsaid that, “Death in Hastings” has none of the romantic je ne sais quoi of say,Death in Venice, or even Paris. Perhaps Wilde, vilified as he was, had thebetter of it after all, at least in terms of style! It has been suggested that Stoker was either a member of the OTO or the GoldenDawn. It would therefore appear that the cohesion and integrity of the symbolismin his Dracula must therefore point to Stoker having a source of esotericinformation far more informed in historical and alchemical terms than any thathe might have obtained. It is more than could be gleaned, as has been suggested,purely from the folklore of Romanian peasants or from contemporary literarysources. Historical accounts of Prince Draculea's life confirm that he was bornin and became Prince of Wallachia, not Transylvania. In linking Draculea withTransylvania however, Stoker suggests to the reader that the origin of theVampire tradition was indeed linked to the Ubaid Homeland. Recent research hasuncovered the fact that Draculea did indeed, like his Scythian Warriorancestors, drink the blood of his impaled and decapitated victims. Decapitation is distinctly a Scythian practice and although it has beensuggested that Draculea learnt the custom of impaling from his Turkish captors,this practice had been used as a punishment by the Aryans of Persia as early as500 BC. Although Stoker has Dracula impaled and decapitated at his castle when in factDraculea was beheaded at the Abbey where he was buried, Stoker is rightlyattempting to associate Dracula, via these rituals, with an entire Vampiriccultural tradition of which his character was destined to become the definitivearchetype. This is no bad thing, because the picture of Dracula and his accoutrements andbehaviour is not far from the actual truth of the matter. The finer details ofthe novel confirm that Stoker was probably being prompted by others in thewriting of this work, which contains secret information that is still generallyunknown outside certain circles. It was generally thought that the only way to kill a Vampire was to impale thebody through the heart—in order to pin the wandering body to the earth—removethe head and cremate the remains. At that time cremation was forbidden inChristian Europe because it was believed that the bodily remains should be leftintact to rise again on the Day of Judgement. Obviously the Church thought that reconstituting the fetid and rotting remainsof sinners on the Last Day would be a simple task for God, whereas he would bepowerless to reconstruct the former human being from a handful of dust.Typically stunning Christian logic in action here. Cremation was practiced by Hindus, a race of people originally descended fromthe Aryan Horse Lords. Considering this as a funerary practice in relation todecapitation and impaling, which was reserved as a royal punishment in Persia,perhaps the peasant memory, prompted by the Church, recalled the link betweenroyalty and these rituals. They then assumed that the only way to kill a Vampirewho was, after all exclusively a member of the Fairy or Royal Race, was to putthe body through a series of ritual processes, some of which had been,variously, components of Scythian royal sacrificial or funerary practice. We can read of royal decapitation in the stories of Bran and Llewelyn. AlthoughCelts buried their common dead, we might suggest, given the earliest evidencefrom Tartaria and other later sites, that Royal Scythians, like their Viking andHindu cousins, cremated the sometimes decapitated remains of their sacred dead,depending on the requirements of specific ritual necessity. Perhaps to thepeasantry, impaling was seen as poetic justice in dispatching one assumed to beof a race for whom impaling was a common punishment. We have seen that impaling was thought to nail the body of the Vampire to theearth. Perhaps when the body was not burnt, impaling was considered sufficientto keep in its grave the body of one belonging to a race that the crows incassocks said was so terrifying and seemingly so indestructible. It will be remembered, though, that many of the stories concerning Vampires werecontrived by the Church to encourage the flock to remain in fear for its lifeand thus faithful to its only means of protection and salvation, the ChristianChurch. It was immaterial to them that vampirism was rarely committed againstoutsiders except when they were opponents in war. Nevertheless the Vampire scarewent on longer than the Witch craze and was just as effective in keeping thepoor peasants in bondage to the evil doctrines of a lying Church. As a Scythian custom, impaling would have been as common in Galatia, laterTurkey, where the Cult of the Head thrived in Roman times; as it was in Persia.Here it was reserved for one royal in particular – Bress. He betrayed hisbrother, Darius, following the successful invasion by Alexander. Essentially Stoker's Dracula is as much a part of the Grail Cycle as the Druidicstories of King Arthur and of Eschenbach's Parzifal. In these stories as in mostDruidic teaching fables, the Bards delighted in presenting material that couldbe read on several different but related levels which often have hermetic, macroand microcosmic components. In particular where Stoker is concerned, an extract from Solomon's Song of Songsfeatures in a couple of obscure lines in his Dracula. These refer directly tothe central alchemical theme of the Grail Cycle and put the seal on the book asbeing an esoteric work, rather than just simply a Gothic novel. Historically Draculea himself attended the “Solomon School” in Hermanstadt, analchemical, hermetic college in Transylvania that taught magic to the sons ofRoyalty. One other school like this existed in Europe, in Toledo in Spain. Atthe “Solomon” only one person per class ever graduated, or “rode the Dragon” asit was termed. Fanciful Christian theory says that the rest of the students ended up with Satanin Hell! Reminiscent of a Druidic “Bangor” or university, the “Solomon School”finished Vlad's education. It suited him to become a Romanian counterpart of theBritish PenDragon, with all the brutal wisdom of his Fairy ancestors andpredecessors who, as God-Kings of the specifically intermediary, guardian-classof Anunnaki deities, were buried in the same manner that Dracula himself waslaid to rest. Draculea, the prince of Wallachia, was little different in actuality from theDracula character of Stoker's novel. This Sacred Prince was a Hermetic scholarand initiate, a student of magic; Magus, Witch Lord and Dragon Prince. Hecounterbalanced the bloodlust of his forebears with a refined knowledge andadvanced practice of Grail procedure which, shining forth radiantly from thepages of Stoker's little masterpiece, echoed the teachings that the historicalDraculea would have received at the “Solomon School”. These teachings wereencountered in the Dragon Court of which he was a member. They were teachingswhich were held in common by Archdruids, Alchemists, Tantric Yogis, Hermeticistsand Qabalists alike, each discipline originating from one ancient FairyTradition in Sumeria and Transylvania— the heartlands of the Dragon Kings andQueens of the Sacred Danaan Peoples. In Draculea's day Christian kings sent their sons to Christian universities.However, true kingship, the Sobekh or Messiah kingship, symbolised sinceantiquity by the Dragon or Sacred Crocodile, required that the true kings' sonslearnt priest-kingship. In Draculea's case, this education was still clearly ofa Druidic nature, even as late as the 15th century. In the Celtic British Isles after the Romans had decamped, princes were requiredto become priests or Druids. As late as 660 AD we can find references concerningthe education of the Merovingian Prince Dagobert at Slane University inIrelandwhere, up until the year 664 AD, Celtic, Druidic Christianity still heldsway. In those days, and as late as 751 AD, Kings still came exclusively from the KingTribe who supplied much of the Celtic world, as well as Eurasia, with Draconianoffspring to serve as Royal Priests. This King Tribe, the Arya or Sidhe—theScythians—included the Merovingian dynasty. Although it was an amalgam of Jesus'Egyptian and Aryan blood, it was also closely related to the Irish and ScotsRoyal Danaan. The Druidic castes integral to these Houses still educated thisdynastic progeny up until the Carolingian usurpation and the ascendance of theChurch of Rome in 664 AD. Gradually at first, the Roman Church replaced the true royal, Elven blood withits own bloodless puppets and made Christian education the norm for the sons ofthe new Christian kings and nobles whom the Church had created. The Solomons ofHermannstadt and Toledo became the hidden leftovers of an ancient, originallyDruidic educational system which necessarily went underground. It became thesubject of myth and Fairytale, along with the bloodlines it once educatedopenly. The Dragon Colleges produced the “Uber”, the Overlords who, in Britain, werecalled the PenDragons and in Transylvania the “Dracoi” or “Dracoica”—the“Vampires”. Only the highest graduates of the Druidic bangors would be thoughtof as true men or women of power, true Sidhe or Fairy Royalty. Thus it was onlythe prince who “rode the Dragon” who could be said to fit the same criteria forinclusion in the bloodline of the Vampire, the Witch and the Fairy families—theDragon Kings. "},{"pageContent":"[images/00052.jpg] Chapter 4 The Thousand-Year Elven Holocaust The study of history is as much the study of etymology as it is the study andinterpretation of actual events. Both are often a daunting task. Ultimatelyhistory is always written by the victors and the meaning of language and thesignificance of historical events are invariably decided by those whose handshave taken a firm hold of the tiller that steers society's ship. The word “Fairy”, as we have come to understand from our educators (ordeceivers), suggests one of a variety of mythic or imaginary beings whose shape,size, habitat and customs differ according to geography and ethnic or aboriginalfolk tradition. Lately, a Fairy has also come to mean a homosexual. A real Fairy, would not care at all about anyone's sexual orientation, and wouldjust think, “it's all bread and bread after all”. The latter definition would beno doubt dismissed entirely, and s/he would nevertheless take extreme exceptionto the former definition for the following reason. Apart from the Jews, no racein history has suffered more brutality and racial prejudice than the Elves. For over a thousand years the Church initiated a consistent policy of genocidethat was and still is unrivalled in human history in terms of itsrelentlessness, violence and hatred. The word genocide is used withjustification. In 1944 Raphael Lemkin formulated the term to define “an attemptat the destruction of the national group as an entity, and the actions involvedare directed at individuals, not in their individual capacity but as members ofa national group”. The United Nations elaborates by saying that genocide includes “the systematicmoral debasement of a group, people or nation”. The Jews have suffered justthis, except in one particular respect. If you were asked your race ornationality today and you replied “Jewish” no one would think twice about it. Imagine, however, asking Mr. Green or Miss Leibowitz what race they were andthey replied “Jewish”. What would be the reaction if you then burst into fits oflaughter and replied “Don't be stupid. Jews don't exist, they're just a myth”?Isn't that what genocide or ethnic cleansing is all about—eradicating all traceof a culture from the human consciousness? This is what has happened to theFairy Race. Certainly the Germans tried it with the Jews, and if they had been given thesame amount of time the Church has had to achieve what they have achieved, nodoubt in a thousand years from now the Jews would have also become a myth. Butthis has already happened to the Fairies. Little trace of their culture oridentity exists outside a handful of the old families or beyond the covers ofsanitised storybooks for children, or tomes on rustic folk tradition, in whichhints of the old lore still remain hidden. Mr. Green and Miss Leibowitz can go about their business in relative freedom,and can be openly proud of their nationality and cultural heritage. For athousand years, the Fairies have had to conceal their identities and live inhiding for fear of being torn to shreds or burnt alive. For a thousand years ithas been a crime to be of the Elven race. You may be surprised to learn that itstill is. Today, whilst the Jews, by the Grace of God, enjoy the acceptance of their racewon through the backlash of public opinion against the Nazi Holocaust, theThousand-Year Elven Holocaust has been forgotten. Still the Fairies have toremain in hiding contemporarily for fear of ridicule and ostracism. In 1736 the Witchcraft Act was repealed. However, it was replaced by theFraudulent Mediums’ Act which is still in force and simply says in one way whatthe Witchcraft Act said in another. According to Christian doctrine no one can contact departed spirits. If this isadmitted, then inevitably all mediums are fraudulent because the Englishlanguage defines a medium as being a person who has commerce with the souls ofthe dead. By Dragon definition a Witch, meaning a Fairy, is a Medium and the law wouldn'tlay a fine distinction upon exactly what the Witch mediates with or how, if theydecided they wanted to win an argument. It will be noticed at this juncture thatby definition, in their prayers to—and visions of—Christ, the Virgin Mary andthe departed Saints, all those who currently call themselves Christians are infact indulging in mediumship. This is the very act which the Church says isimpossible and by which edict they render their entire following heretical. Thishas always been the case and during the Witch craze, all things considered, itwas actually the heretics who were burning the orthodox Christians. If the Witch mediates with ancestors, she claims to be able to contact the dead.As the Church says this is impossible, the Witch is a fraud and is breaking thelaw. Ergo to be, or claim to be a Witch, and consequently a Fairy, on that countalone, is illegal. The Witchcraft laws are alive and well and living in astatute book near you. Further by implication, it is possible for a Fairy to betried under the treason act as well, on two counts. Firstly Her Majesty the Queen is a Christian and head of the Church of England.No Fairy aware of his or her history and the atrocities committed against theirpeople could ever be what is contemporarily thought of as an orthodox Christian.In this sense they run the risk of committing an act of Treason by denying theChristian faith, because in doing so, like others following different paths,they refute and insult the faith of Her Majesty. Secondly, the Fairy families stood in absolute opposition to the Donation ofConstantine, this being the document that was used to usurp them and initiatethe Elven Holocaust itself in the first place. The Donation of ConstantineThe Donation of Constantine first appeared during the 8th century and was adocument which purported to recognise the Roman popes as Christ'srepresentatives on Earth and to donate to Pope Sylvester and the Roman Churchall those Imperial powers formerly invested in the Throne of Byzantium. The Donation, the Church claimed, was written in the 4th century at theinsistence of the Emperor Constantine. The Church said that he was so gratefulfor having been cured of leprosy by Pope Sylvester that he gave into theChurch's hand the entire power and wealth of the unified Roman Empire, includingthe right to crown and dethrone kings. Now that is what you call expensivemedical insurance. Supposedly written before 337 AD—the year of Constantine's death—the Donation ofConstantine actually didn't make an appearance on the stage of European historyuntil four hundred years later. So far-reaching are the powers bestowed upon theChurch by this document, one would have thought that it would have been madepublic at the time of its bestowal. Not centuries later. The provisions of the Donation were enforced in 751 AD. The Merovingians wereshortly thereafter deposed by the Church and replaced by their sycophants, theMayors of the Palace, who later became known as the Carolingians. The Church hadmade a compact with the Mayors and offered to “recognise” their legitimacy asrulers if they would dispense with the true Dragon Kings. The deal was done andthe Carolingians were made the puppet rulers under the Roman Church. The Donation, because it was made by a Dragon King, Constantine, legitimised theChurch's right to take this action. To all intents and purposes they had theauthority of Dragon Kingship given up to them by this Charter. No doubt theMerovingians knew this to be a fraud, which is why they refused to recognise theauthority of the Church to meddle in affairs of state. What do we learn fromthis? We can see from the Church's choice of “benefactor” that the Church was wellaware that universally, only those of the Dragon Blood would be recognised astrue kings. Therefore they chose Constantine as he was known to have beendescended from both the Britannic PenDragon House and the Dragon House of David.Furthermore he was a member of the desposyni— the heirs of the Lord—the blooddescendants and legitimate representatives of Jesus Christ. In the Donation itappeared as if Constantine had relinquished his hereditary spiritual position asa Messiah and invested it in the Papacy. By suggesting they were the representatives of Christ, the popes were claimingDragon descent for themselves. It was well known that Jesus had descendants andthat they were part of the only Eurasian dynasty which was authorised to bekings—the Elven Overlords or Dragons. It would have appeared to the public then,that in the displacement of the Merovingians, one Dragon dynasty was beingreplaced by another, albeit a paper one. This reduced any danger of mass unrest. As time passed however, it becameuncomfortably clear that the function of kingship under the Merovingians hadbeen entirely different to that under the Carolingians. Whilst the Merovingianshad formerly assumed the role of overseers, sages and wise counsellors, theCarolingians and their successors, prompted by the Church, became deliberatelypoorly educated, pig ignorant, insensitive tyrants and territorial tradesmen. Dragon Kingship and the Grail Code had died to be replaced by a corrupted formof feudal totalitarianism and brutal, economic slavery as the Church carefullyand strategically replaced the old dynasties with its own merchant-class clientfamilies who, from that day forth, became vassals of the Vatican. Lastly we learn that from 751 AD the true Dark Age began in earnest. The ElvenHolocaust was initiated and would run its course for another thousand yearsuntil, in England at least, the Witchcraft laws were repealed in 1736. North ofthe border in Scotland, however, the persecution of Witches in the 1700's was atits fiercest until the end of the century. During this time, history has witnessed the rise of the Church of Rome and itssuccessful struggle for power. In time no dynasty ruled in Europe or remained inpower unless the Church sanctioned their reign. The Church chose the royalfamilies, it crowned kings and deposed its detractors. In short, the Church,under the auspices of the Donation of Constantine was the sole and supremetemporal power in Europe and the known world. Without this purported imperialbenefice however, the Church would have remained a marginalized Mediterraneancult contesting for patronage along with a host of other gnostic Christiandenominations. The royal dynasties, sponsored by the Church and crowned by its Divine Right,instituted their courts and parliaments, passed laws and employed agents to acton their behalf. To all intents and purposes it seemed as if the Church had theabsolute right of Dragons and wielded power by the very sanction of Jesus Christand God. No monarch reigning today and no government under the monarch or instituted intheir name would enjoy their position if the Church, empowered by the Donation,had not given them permission to rule in the first place. Without the Donationof Constantine, European history today would be totally different and none ofthe dynasties past or present would have had the right to have reigned. Norwould they reign now and none of their governments or agencies would haveexercised power. One slight problem, though. The Donation of Constantine is a complete and utterfraud and the Church was never given any temporal powers at all, let alone theright to found dynasties, crown kings or institute governments. The wholedocument was a lie from beginning to end and has been known to be a fake sinceLorenzo Valla applied the methods of historical criticism to it during theRenaissance. How do we know Valla was correct? The New Testament references incorporated intothe wording of the Donation were taken from the Latin Vulgate version of theBible. The Vulgate Bible was compiled by St. Jerome, who was born more than twodecades after Constantine was supposed to have signed the Donation. The actualVulgate Bible wording that appears in the Donation didn't exist until St. Jeromeinvented it, fifty years after the document had supposedly been dated and signedby the Emperor. By this time Constantine had been dead for decades and couldn'thave signed the Dragons’ rights away anyway. The language of the Donation is eighth-century clerical or dog Latin, whilst theLatin used in the 4th century Empire was late classical Roman. The Imperial andPapal ceremonials described in the Donation didn't exist in Constantine's timebut were developed some centuries later. Several documentary instances of the Church's use of the Donation to asserttheir authority in the medieval period still exist, including the letter of PopeGregory IX entitled Si Memoriam Beneficiorum, dated October 23rd 1236 andaddressed to the Emperor Frederick II. Pope Gregory writes,“...that as the Vicar of the Prince of Apostles (the Roman Pope) governed theempire of priesthood and of souls in the whole world, so he should also reignover things and bodies throughout the whole world; and considering that, heshould rule over earthly matters by the reins of justice to whom—as it isknown—God had committed on earth the charge over spiritual things. TheEmperor Constantine humbled himself by his own vow and handed over theempire to the perpetual care of the Roman Pontiff with the Imperial Insigniaand sceptres and the City and Duchy of Rome...”. People in the medieval and Renaissance period, confronted with this document,did not generally criticise the Donation on the grounds of its veracity. Theyjust exclaimed aghast that they could not believe that Constantine would havebeen stupid enough to have given the Roman Church everything. From the Donation we understand that Constantine offered the Pope all the robesand Crowns of office but the Pope, being such a humble man, gave them back tothe Emperor. This lets the Church off the hook should some malcontent turn upand ask for sartorial evidence. If the readers peruse the Donation forthemselves they will be appalled at the pretentious egotism, arrogance and sheermaterial greed of the Church, as authors of the document. The fraudulent imperial power of the Vatican to create kings by“coronation”—derived from this faked 8th century Donation of Constantine—waslater adopted by the Archbishops of the Church of England with the complicity ofthe Tudors, who were Catholics themselves. When he split with Rome, Henry VIII still retained and later ratified andre-established in the Anglo-Catholic Church of England the fraudulent right ofthe Church's clergy to create by coronation, a succession of British monarchs.This was an illegal act. The Donation of Constantine was proved to be acompletely fake document. Therefore no Royal Elven House that knew its originsand cared about social justice could possibly bring itself to recognise aChristian British monarchy or any of their Church sponsored, Church crownedpredecessors or any of their regnant or formerly regnant, European cousinHouses. Because the Donation was a fraud and no subsequent priest of any Catholicderived denomination ever had the right to crown kings, Britain has had nolegally reigning monarch for 900 years. As a consequence of this, all the lawspassed by these monarchs were and are illegal and worthless and all thegovernmental agencies set up by or derived from these monarchs or their laws arealso illegal and worthless up to the present day. When considering this, the reader might like to consider the fact that all thearrests ever made by the police in Britain and Europe are acts of kidnap andhabeus corpus. Equally, any man who has taken up arms for the Crown and killedfor his country is unprotected by law and guilty therefore of murder. However, paradoxically, as the entire British legal system is illegal, there areno laws, and so the crimes of habeus corpus and murder as we define them today,simply do not exist. Subconsciously, people know that their politicians andmonarchs have no legitimate authority to rule over them. They manifest thisknowledge in an increasing disrespect for these optional, arbitrary and illusorysocial conventions, which is yet another reason why social order is breakingdown. If the UN is right, we may face chaos in the near future—and all because of astupid fraud, perpetrated by a group of myopically greedy, maniacal peddlers offalse religion who are now long dead. Again, for asserting this kind of view the Fairies are implicitly guilty ofTreason, even though all British laws are constitutionally illegal and the actof treason itself is a non sequitur. Think of the implications of this. It applies to any nation state in the Christian world today is still a monarchyor which has evolved as part of a successive, developing political processoriginating from a monarchy, by virtue of its continuing sanction from, orsponsorship by, the Church of whatever denomination. It is unauthorised by anytemporal or divine power to coerce anyone to obey any law originating at anystage of that government's evolution. In effect Britain, Europe and America are ruled by the sword, and that sword isbeing wielded by people who are no more than short sighted, selfseeking robberbarons. They have no constitutional right to rule even in America, where in the19th century the libertarian commentator, Lysander Spooner, demonstrated thatthe consensual nature of the original document, upon which the subsequent,consecutive clauses are founded, was being flouted, thereby making the entireConstitution illegal. Pierre Proud'hon called them all “Tyrants and Usurpers”.Next time you are tempted to eulogise Western Democracy, bite your tongue andlet your brain select first gear before you open your mouth. Flawed orotherwise, the idea that the English speaking world has any democracy at all isa joke. At the beginning of this work the author stated that the people have been connedenough. He now hopes that the readers might appreciate for themselves theprecise extent to which the people have actually been deceived. They haveaccepted a state of affairs where they and their ancestors have been enslaved bya chameleon-like corporate body that has destroyed their creativity and robbedthem of their psychological liberty and freedom of conscience for over athousand years. The entire moral basis of our society is founded upon a massive historical liewhich has twisted the minds of generations of individuals until they have becometerrified of the natural drives of their own bodies and souls. The resultant taboos that have been created have been used to divide the mindsof the people and make them dependant on the Church-State for solutions to theproblems of resisting Satan and fighting temptation and sin when thesecontrived, nonsensical whimsies never existed in the first place. As a result, western Christian society was turned into an open air lunaticasylum packed full of lost souls who weren't lost at all and had no need of acure for diseases of the soul that they weren't actually suffering from in thefirst place. The Church created the confusion and the division and then offered the solution.In fear, the population invested its trust in the perfidious Church and inreturn for their confidence the Church turned the people into slaves and anentire civilisation into a manufacturing plant to service their own greed forluxury and power. For a thousand years the Fairies have remained silent about theiridentities—formerly for fear of their lives—latterly for fear of becoming socialoutcasts and objects of mirth and derision. Still however, a shadow of menacelies over the ancient families. Greed will go to any length to ensure thecontinuity of its satisfaction and the same motives that prompted the Church tomurder and lie in the past, still prompt their merchant-class puppets to killand deceive today. Whilst people therefore now understand the Fairy to be either a gossamer wingedsprite or an effeminate male, both are considered harmless jokes. Such acontemporary opinion flies in the face of the facts where the Fairy of historyis concerned. In studying the Fairy in the context of both Celtic and medieval history it mustbe remembered that the tribes to whom the Victorians ascribed the appellation“Celtic” were not a homogenous or integrated racial group and the Celtsthemselves never saw themselves as a cohesive, pan-European nation of peoples.Furthermore, like their medieval descendants, they had, within an indistinctcollection of tribes, a patriarchal, misogynistic culture, which stands incomplete opposition to the popular view that the matriarchal “Celts” promoted apolicy of sexual equality. (M. Green: Celtic World) The modern myth concerning the Celts, promoted by “New Age” racketeers who arerehashing earlier popular trends, tends to set these rather ordinary people intosome kind of “Golden Era” of cultural expression and heroism, punctuated by theachievement of a state of high spiritual awareness. In fact, they were average,workaday farming folk who treated their women like dirt. Nymphs and Shepherds... Go Away!The Georgians and Victorians, for socio-political propaganda purposes, hadvarious revivals and retrospectives. These were intended to celebrate themerchant-class era of industrial prosperity and the British Imperial oppressionand destruction of the cultures of other peoples, by having the audacity toequate such dubious ventures with various “Golden Ages” of the past(paraphrasing Sir Ernst Gombrich). Principally it was these individuals who patronised the artistic movements whoseSvengalis, seeing that the parvenus were only too willing to advance and buy thelie, produced the kind of sentimental, heroic nonsense that plugged the gap inthe nostalgia market. This was created by the desire of the newly rich to feelthat they were justified by history in the exploitation of the poor in the millsand the mines. They wished to equate their “victories” in the marketplaces withthose of the “warrior king” or “noble savage” on the battlefields of classicalantiquity. By sponsoring flamboyant painters, they felt they could becomeidentified with the highest artistic and cultural achievements of the variousages whose elan flattered these imperialists' and industrialists' egotism. Inthis way, they furthered their exploitative, propagandist aims. However, in Newtonian terms, where every action engenders an equal and oppositereaction, the patronage afforded these artists and sculptors, by magnates whosecultural tastes only ran to jingoism or sentimentality, led to a calamitous passwhere artistic standards plummeted. In the words of the art historian Sir Ernst Gombrich, “There is no such thing as‘Art’......there are only artists”. And by God: By their fruits ye shall knowthem well enough. Culturally vacuous steel barons and cotton magnates would often display framedfamily charts—tracing the kinds of instant, purchased ancestry purchased by anancestor—that any genuine self respecting nobleman would shun outright. Their“miladies” would hold soirees, for the local cognoscenti and well-to-do, wherethe cultural a la carte invariably offered copious helpings of moronic, Byronicneo-classical claptrap garnished lavishly with choruses of criminally insane,musical atrocities like “Nymphs and shepherds come away”, sung by fat falsettoaunts who hadn't a clue what Nymphs were, customarily renowned for getting up towhen they actually did “come away” with or without the rustic parties of thesecond part. And these arachnid recreational activities were namely: Cannibalism(“fancy another helping of Shepherd's Pie, Myrtle?”) and—as their nameunavoidably suggests—Nymphomania; which found the outworking of the expressionof its inner, emotive rage and lust to be manifest in such acts as oral sex,buggery, simultaneous multiple penetration and bestiality; with a wide varietyof domestic livestock, and an equally varied selection of naturally occurringregional fauna—including wolves, dogs, donkeys, wild goats, rams, horses, snakesand—purely for betting purposes—ferrets. Such sexually epicurean piquancies were practiced with gay abandon alongsiderampant homosexuality (amongst the shepherds who'd managed to survive lunch),Sapphism, drug abuse, alcoholic debauchery, Travel Scrabble, and a range ofother delightfully civilised, lubricious distractions. (Riley-Scott: PhallicWorship) At that time, the true nature of Celtic culture was censored, sanitised andidealised so much that the view we have had of it up until recently reflectedmore our predecessors’ confusion, chauvinism and wishful thinking concerning theperiod than it did the reality of the era they lauded. Modern archaeology coupled with a realistic interpretation of the information,less coloured by the concern for moral rectitude, has uncovered a picture of“Celtic” society that is clearer than it was in our grandparents’ day. Indeedwith the wealth of new knowledge we find it difficult to apply so liberally thegeneric term “Celt” in the same way our forebears were wont to do. Scholarshipconcerning what previously we might have thought of as the “heroic era” ofCeltic civilisation, conveyed in modern popular works that owe much of theirsentimentality to the erroneous and prim historical view of yesteryear, isgarbled and confused. The images of the noble Celt: the tall blonde warrior chieftain, or theflaxen-haired Swan Maidens of Lyr are not Celtic at all. We still seem to thinkof all Celts in that way because we are sold the image by people who, inaccepting as fact the Victorian delusion, think that this distinct caste wasrepresentative of the Celts as a whole. In fact, they represented a tinyminority of individuals who were foreign to and essentially divorced in racialand cultural terms from the people we now know were the real Celts living inthat era. When we look at the stories contained in the Annals of Irish History, the IrishBook of Invasions or the Welsh Mabinogian, we are inclined to think that thesedocuments were about the Celts. They were actually about a strange race offoreigners who reigned alongside these dark-haired, swarthy, stocky littlefarmers for nearly two thousand years. From these stories we obtained our ideaof what the “Celts” were like when, in fact, they weren't Celts at all. Theywere Scythians, the Elves, the Fairies, the Aryans. These Scythians were a tightly knit, insular group who practiced Phoenician andPharaonic marriage customs to keep the blood pure and in all other respects theytended to remain detached from the common swell of humanity. Differing greatlyfrom the customs of the patriarchal Celtic peoples they reigned over, theirs wasa society that appreciated the position and power of its women andcorrespondingly favoured the idea of matrilinear descent. The Scythians came to reign across Eurasia and normally we find them attached tovarious indigenous populations, but occasionally they were an indigenouspopulation in themselves, such as the Danaan of Eire and the Ainu of Hokkaido.Unlike their Celtic clients, whose caste system, based on kinship, wasmale-dominated and hierarchical, the Scythian caste system, which operatedamongst their own people, was egalitarian. Though individuals’ functions and tasks varied, all nevertheless were royal andtherefore equal. Proof of this is to be found in the Brehon Law concerninginheritance. This social structure became superimposed onto the Celtic systemand produced the sort of divisions we find in Hinduism where the people areseparated into three distinct classes: Brahmins or Priests Ksatriyas or Warriors Sudras or Smiths Beneath these are settled the untouchables or slaves. The Scythian system had the same three divisions but these were arranged on thehorizontal plane and did not proffer any superior status in relation to theother castes. If one overlaid the Elven, Scythian system onto that of theCeltic, which is virtually identical with the present Hindu system, we wouldhave the following social configuration: Gods of HeavenGods of Heaven and EarthGods of Earth or Druidic Royal Ancestors, the transcended onesRoyal Archdruids, Druidesses and PenDragons (Vampires)War Kings, War Lords, Craftsmen, Metalworkers, etc.Caucasian footsoldiers and Dravidian “Brownies”Burgh ChiefsMen at ArmsFarmers, Tinkers, TradersWomenSlaves (Celtic source—Miranda Green, Celtic World, Routledge, London, 1995.) It will be noticed that, contrary to contemporary misconceptions, Celtic womenwere in fact just above slaves in terms of their rank and were regularly boughtand sold or exchanged by their men for cattle, along with the slaves. It is not a popular view but sadly—given the contemporary academic discoveriesconcerning the real nature of Celtic society—it is an accurate one. Although wewould love to blame the Church for everything, including the oppressivepatriarchy that subdued women, the fact is that the Celts were already treatingtheir women like chattels before the Church reared its ugly head above theblood-stained meniscus line of history. The conversations or entreaties of love we see recorded in the “Celtic” Sagasbetween “Celtic” lords and ladies, were in fact the exchanges between Scythianmen and women. That which is reported as being the love poetry of the “Celts”was instead the love poetry of the Elves—the Royal Scythians— not that of abrutal farming folk who had neither lords nor ladies. Who in history, if he had the rare gift of writing, would bother wasting such atalent, do you think, by eulogising the sexual peccadilloes or romantic longingsof a bunch of turnip farmers who wouldn't have spoken to women on such equalterms anyway? Romance in any case didn't come into it, the Celtic woman justgrinned and bore it. The art of male wooing and flattery arises when the woman has the freedom tochoose to say no. The only women who had that choice then were ScythianPrincesses. Because of the mysterious composition of their blood and itsconsequent magical powers, they had a lot more to offer their Elven menfolk thansexual intercourse, which is all that nondescript Celtic women could hope tohave had in their favour. The beauty and exquisiteness of the magic that a Scythian Princess had to offercould not be taken by force. She had to give it willingly. Otherwise, in the actof coercion, her magic would be tainted and become either useless or poisonous. Occupying a position higher than the Elven male was Goddess incarnate. Elven menwere pleased therefore to treat her with deference and honour and to offer hercourt in a manner that would secure her voluntary participation in their sacredcongress. From this obligation of service to such Earthly Goddesses arose themedieval tradition of Courtly Love which, by no means and under nocircumstances, was ever intended to be offered to the female descendants ofeither Celt, Norman or Saxon. Today, after hundreds of years of oppression, the female descendants of thesepoor, downtrodden Celtic and later Anglo-Norman women have managed, during theclosing years of the millennium, to wrest from their men the equality thatevaded their mothers for centuries. Now they demand to stand on an equal footingwith their menfolk but, like their sisterly ancestors, when push comes to shovethey have nothing more dynamic or magical to offer than sexual intercourse. However, the male descendants of the Celts and the later AngloNormans—theexamples of manhood living today—have in turn nothing better or more magical tooffer their women either, and never have. Therefore, equality between the sexesseems to be quite an equitable and logical arrangement whereby the mediocre donot differentiate between, nor discriminate against, each other's mediocrity onthe basis of gender. Passing on from the politics of sex originating in the caste system, we nowreturn to addressing the system as a whole and notice that the figure above is ageneralisation which encapsulates the main divisions between each social level. As time passed and the population increased, technology developed anddiversified and the main castes became sub-divided into classes within classes.At length the castes themselves eventually became overturned and the WarriorClass gained the ascendant, later to be upturned, in the last 1200 years, by theMerchant Class, whom the Hindus call the Sudras. In the twentieth century we also saw situations where the untouchables becamethe rulers, as in China and Soviet Russia. Presently we have a situation wherethe Elven Race, at the bottom of the pile, have become the untouchables, whilstthe increasingly and frighteningly acquisitive Peasants and the Merchants are atthe top, having wrested their positions from the block-headed Warriors. The endproduct of this fiasco over the last millennium and a half can be smelled in theair, tasted in the water supply and seen in the eyes of diseased, starving,third world children. Its results can be heard in the screams of animals gratuitously tortured inexperiments aimed at testing the toxicity of vanity products, or of medicinesintended to make money for these extortionists whose worthless over-inflatedproducts titillate, save or prolong the lives of a race of peasants. At its inception, the caste system was not an arbitrary set of divisions orinequalities established through main force by a varying collection ofsequential oppressors. It was a reflection of the fact that there weredifferences in the capabilities and capacities of the different types of humanbeings alive at the time. Some were ingenious artists, builders and artisans,some were naturally gifted traders and negotiators. Some had been bred to havean overview and some were fearless, heroic soldiers. Each group had its part toplay in the functioning of society. Whilst some peoples—like the Celts—had green fingers and could make carrots growrose blossoms in Hell, most Scythians could not even grow the equivalent of aninfants’ school size tray of mustard and cress. However, the Celts were unableto organise complex societies and depended on the Scythians for foresight,guidance and protection. Centuries earlier similar arrangements developed in the east where the Aryansand the Dravidians, having been frequently at war with each other, finally cameto an amicable social arrangement whereby all parties ultimately benefited. Likethe Celts, the Dravidians could get dinner from dust and their expertise andpracticality was the backbone of the Aryo-Dravidian symbiotic culture. Suchsymbiotic relationships are also commonly to be observed amongst differentspecies in the natural world and work brilliantly within what must be admittedis a hierarchical natural order which, nevertheless is not a system ofinequality or self conscious elitism, but one of necessity. From about 1800 BC onwards, with the increase in Eurasian populations, theoccurrence of a variety of natural disasters and the diminishing of rangeterritory through foreign conquests, the Scythians and the Aryans were forced toseek more settled lives. However, being mainly predators and rangers, theylacked the skills to make farming work. They needed the Hobbit-like peoples ofthe Celtic and Dravidian cultures to tend the land and in times that werebecoming increasingly more violent, these cultures needed the Aryans andScythians to protect them. This tolerance and co-operation continued until the emergence of the warriorlords, literally the middle class of their day. Their elitist, hierarchicalgovernmental structures—based on the right of might—became entrenched in westerncivilisation as the feudal system during the years of the Roman Church'sascendancy and totalitarianism. From this point onwards the exploitation of the caste system as an ideal toolfor breeding elitism, division and inequality became rife. The Roman Church,comprising mainly sudras and peasants, saw a chance to claw its way to power.Its hierarchy upturned the original caste system by ninety degrees, turning itinto a ladder to enable them to climb to what they conceived to be the top ofthe pile and the easy life. Only humans would seek to differentiate and assert their superiority based ontheir position within a social structure that, founded on natural law, wasoriginally intended, in contrast, to be for the benefit of all and to functionthrough co-operation. In their egotism, humans abused a natural and beneficialorder to the detriment of all those subscribing to it. In the 20th and 21st centuries the audacity of usurpation continues when theignorant middle-classes, shopkeepers and their vapid shopkeeper sons, joingroups of white supremists who idolise the image of the blond-haired, blue-eyedAryan. This particular genotype, the warrior, who also occupied the middle classor caste, seems naturally to appeal to this middle class today. Unaware of thefact that Aryans had red hair and green eyes, they have, as a result of theirlack of education and intelligence, elevated the usurping warrior to the statusof a true Aryan king. In reality the blond-haired, blue-eyed ideal, so belovedof the Germans and for good reason, was bred, like your average white racisttoday, to be fundamentally stupid. A warrior could never have manifest the attributes of Aryan kingship in amillion years. Kingship took spirit, wisdom and brains. The blond warrior hadnone of these qualities, and wasn't bred to have them. In the feudal period thewarrior was called a baron. This word stemmed from the earlier Latin word baro,which was in circulation at a time contemporary with the rise of the warriorclasses. Baro literally means “thickhead”. It is typical of the racist working and middle classes that they would pick sucha figure to emulate. Aryan means wise king, not dumb blond. The adoration by theGerman National Socialists of the blonde warrior god-king and the assumptionever since by successive generations that he is an Aryan, must have been heavilyinfluenced by the 13th-century Royal Poet, Snorri Sturleson. In his Sayings of Har, he defines a corrupted Scandinavian caste systemconsisting of Jarls, Carls and Thralls. The Jarls, says Snorri, were blonde, theCarls were red-haired and the Thralls were black-haired. Everywhere else the royal colouring is red and this tradition goes back in theAryans to Radamanthus, Ariadne and Minos, and through them to Lilith herself.Even Jesus and Magdalene are regularly and invariably portrayed with red hair inthe Renaissance masterpieces. A reversal has taken place here where warriorsusurped or replaced kings as leaders of the people. The warriors were hired Caucasians, not bloodline Aryans. The upheaval andresultant inequity and iniquity within the caste system occurred when theirsociety’s War Kings legitimately displaced many Aryan queens and kings in timesof trouble. They were never to return to their thrones because the conflictsoften carried on for decades. Sometimes however, having had a taste of power, treacherous and greedy warriorcaptains decided they would either go it alone or take over permanently by forceof arms. Following this, however, an even more stupid class of people managed totrade and poison their way to the top. And who were they? That's right, the settled warehouse tinkers—the cheatingpeasants with money who were the ancestors of the upper and middle classes oftoday. You might think that they were genuine aristocracy because they have inheritedtitles like Earl or Duke or Lord. What you wouldn't realise is that they onlyinherited these titles because their ancestors were traders who had had enoughmoney to buy them from Christian kings who were also elevated peasants. And youwonder why the Earth is in such a state? When the world is run by tinkers, as it is now, the tinker mentality leads toeverything being seen as having a price tag attached to it. Everything thenbecomes a “marketable commodity” and its significance or importance becomeslinked to its “marketing potential”. We have become so used to such values andthe buzz words that accompany them that we no longer see the inherent immoralityor dangers implied therein. We now have a situation where profiteers callingthemselves “doctors” can visit indigenous peoples, take blood samples and patentthose individuals' genes. In effect, it would then be possible for the doctors of the Humano Gene Projectto file a complaint in an international court and prosecute those sameindigenous populations for the theft of the doctors' patented property.Essentially this is slavery under a different guise, where various ethnicpeoples belong to an American Medical Corporation, run by a government-backedelite who are—as Americans—a nation whose leaders have it in their power todestroy the world. The ancient, egalitarianism of the Scythians’ own social order manifested itselfin such concepts as the democratic system of voting for Archdruids andPenDragons. The “family”, comprised of the regional divines and princes, wouldelect both chief priest and high king—sometimes one and the same person—forpriests and kings were interchangeable. In many ways this system was replicatedin the Saxon Atheling Pool, where prospective rulers were chosen from the mostsuitable candidates available. (Richard Dufton) This royal reserve, from whence were chosen kings from a race of kings, alsoextended itself to mediate in matters of marriage. Where election to high-priestor priestesshood and kingship were concerned, only the very best and mostqualified would be picked. In the case of a king he had to be without physicalor spiritual blemish. The successful candidate was the most spirituallypowerful, learned, and showed the most gracious of manners. (Annals of IrishHistory) Such criteria were also applied when princesses or princes were selected formarriage to each other. These were arranged by the Druids between the very bestfamilies within the various tuadhes in the kingdoms. This ensured that the fruitof any such royal union would represent an enhancement of all the most admiredand required attributes necessary for a royal dynasty, thus reinforcing theperfection of the royal race itself. Both Hindu and medieval marriage customswere derived from this Scythian practice. (Hall) For the Scythians the ability to perform magic—to manifest the Sidhe— was innateand hereditary in very much the same way as we view other skills as being today,such as Fine Art, for instance. Selective unions gave the race the opportunityto breed outstanding magicians whose gifts of natural perception andunderstanding, and whose ability to access the “Otherworld”, helped to produceand guide brilliant kings who reigned with elegant aplomb. The ability toperform magic was carried in the blood and if that blood became watered down bymarriages entered into with outsiders, the genetic strain was weakened and sowas the ability to perform magic. The Aryan-Scythians were not colour-prejudiced. Even though they were whitethemselves, they did not marry other whites. The purity of the Elven blood wasabsolutely necessary in order to enable the Dragon Kings and Queens to maintaintheir magical abilities and the quality and depth of their perception. The Elveswere relied upon by their client races to be able to see things and performfeats that these client races couldn't. In this way they could fulfil theirobligatory roles as the Seers and Guides that their clients had required themfor in the first place. These clients acknowledged that they were naturally unable to have an overviewor to perform higher magic. Therefore it was not in their best interest to allowthe Elves to dilute the Elven blood by intermarriage with members of that clientrace. This wasn't racism but a mutually acknowledged understanding that theElves were originally of an entirely different subspecies, rather than justbeing of a different race. This separatist custom was still vigorously upheld by the British rural workingclasses up until the first half of the 20th century when they themselves stillconsidered intermarriage between the castes to be an outrage and a danger tosocial order. Although something of a misguided view, given the arrivistebackgrounds of most of the contemporary aristocracy, it is a clear example ofthe way in which custom, however inappropriately applied, arises from ancientracial memory. If a white person refused to mate with black people, you might be tempted tocall the individual a racist. However, if anyone of any colour refused to matewith other primates, you would not for one moment think of accusing them ofracism, whatever their colour, as the other primates are of a different species.The Holy Bible refers to the sons of Samael as goats and the sons of Jehovah assheep. Here then we have a classical acknowledgement that it was understood fromancient times that there was in fact a difference between Elves and Men. According to Genesis of the Grail Kings by Laurence Gardner and Nicholas de Vere(Introduction), this difference is also recorded in the Sumerian cylinder rollsfrom whence the biblical material was extracted. These same cylinder rollsrecord the assertion that the Elves made man by a series of processes thatresulted in the Elves being only a quarter related to man at the time. It is known that in antiquity the Nephilim, the Elven sons of the Anunnagiinterbred with human women who were the result of this experiment and who intheir turn produced the Naphidim. However it is recorded that these halfbreedswere destroyed long before the Black Sea Flood, and the slate was wiped clean. The next experiment produced a lineage of pure-bred Elven queens and kings whowere to supervise a race of quarter breeds who were originally created formanual labour. The quarter breeds, nevertheless, were eventually to gain theirfreedom and elect their own chieftains. They were helped by the Elven dynasty,the people whom Christians now think of as the spawn of Satan. This kind ofattitude goes a long way in determining exactly what the Church feels abouthuman emancipation. These people interbred with anyone and we know them now as the biblical race ofAdam whose Elven blood today is so diluted as to be infinitesimal. The pureElven Queens and Kings however bred with no one but themselves and so throughoutthe past five or six millennia, the blood was kept more or less pure in severalunbroken lines of descent until as late as the8th century AD. From that time however, only one bloodline descent is recordedas being pure and unbroken. Only that one single named dynasty driving from anhistorical Elven Royal House contemporarily described as such, still existstoday. As human blood diluted however, the need for Elven Overlords increased, and fromthe second millennium BC the Scythians, as they came to be known, were in greatdemand as Queens and Kings, Seers and Magi. This continued up until about 751AD, when the Elven Holocaust began in earnest. From 500 BC onward, during thedecline of the increasingly insular Elven population in Europe, it was not thecase that they, at that time, were “higher” than the other species as they hadbeen previously. They were simply different from them. In a world that was becoming increasingly more structured, the Elves needed manas much as man needed the Elves. One should understand that during the variouslater periods in history when these social arrangements were entered into, theywere seen as being complementary. Not competitive or hierarchical. Such separatism then was born of pragmatism and necessity. In those days it wasknown that hormonal levels were influenced by genetic inheritance and thathormones affected the individual's perceptions, psychological indivi-Dualism andthe subsequent ability to transcend and perceive the intricacies of the workingsof the cosmos. Elven blood was rich in these substances. Maintaining the purity of the blood therefore was of paramount importance.Intermarriage between the Scythian reigning houses and members of the Celtic, orany other race, was strictly forbidden and greatly lamented if it did occur.However on occasion we read in folktales or histories the stories of the mutualtheft of brides from each camp by both Celtic chieftains and Scythian kings. Many of these stories are suspect and were written during the period of theRoman Church's ascendancy. The motive for these stories was to propagate themyth that the Fairy blood was being watered down. The Church, by spreading thisrumour, hoped to persuade the peasants that their traditional friends andprotectors, the Elven Queens and Kings, were losing their power along with thepurity of their blood and were thereby becoming ineffectual and thus redundant. If the people could be convinced of this, then they would believe that the ageof magic was dying and invest their support in the Church instead. A clever lie.In most instances, if not all, these so-called Celtic chieftains were not, infact, “Celtic” at all but Milesian Scythians. Such misrepresentations occurthroughout the monkish reworkings of Gaelic history. An apt example of this isin the Christianised story of Lugh and the Queen of Sovereignty in which Lughadmits to having once being a mortal king. This is untrue. Sometimes we too read the stories of the love between Fairies and humans,representing the marriages between Scythians and indigenous families. In latertimes, far more unpleasant tales emerged concerning the decline of the Elvenfamilies who had had to go into hiding from, the Church fathers said, the CelticMilesians. At this point, in Eire, the Danaan became the Daouine Sidhe, the people of thehills. This would have occurred from about 500 BC onwards. This didn't actuallyhappen with the ubiquity, rapidity or finality that the Church reports. Scythianprinces and princesses of the Tuadha d'Anu or Danaan were still at large, upuntil the Battle of Clontarf. Why did the Church bother with the weak blood yarnif they had all been wiped out, unless they were adopting a double safeguardpolicy? If anyone drove the Elves into hiding and instigated their “final” (?) decay itwas not the Milesians, but the Church itself. From this period in time arose thetale of the Fairy changeling. It is asserted that after waves of invasions andthe decline in Fairy numbers following wars with people such as the Milesians,though now living in virtual isolation in the forests, the Fairies stillmaintained their taboos concerning marriage between the races. The result of this, said the Church chroniclers, was continuous in-breedingresulting in deformed and sickly offspring. When an enclave of Elves had becomeso inbred, they reported, it was often their custom to steal local children andraise them for breeding purposes in order to inject some fresh DNA into theFairy gene pool. However, that, apparently, was not the only reason for suchthefts, it was intimated darkly. As has already been pointed out, the Fairies practiced Phoenician and Pharaonicmarriage. The former is the union of father and daughter, which in thehorse-breeding world is acclaimed for producing the finest, healthiestthoroughbreds. The second is union between brother and sister, an arrangementthat, according to geneticists at Cambridge University, can continue for up tothree hundred years—ten generations—before any genetic problems are madeapparent. As they didn't suffer from the moral stupidity encouraged by theChurch, they had ample scope to vary the types of alliances they made in-caste,and thereby prevent hereditary problems from occurring too often. However, leaving that to one side, allow for the probability that at least athousand Elves survived the various calamities reported to have befallen them,prior to and following the first millennium AD. If those thousand Elves cameperhaps from six loosely related clans, you have at least six varying gene poolsfrom which to choose partners, before resorting to intense incest in any case. From the time of the Milesian victory and the flight of the Fairies into thehills in 500 BC, and the emergence of these Church sponsored stories of childkidnap and incestuous deformity, there must have lapsed about a thousand years.This form of ecclesiastical propaganda began in earnest after 751 AD. The Milesians and the Danaan had settled their differences some time before andwere interbreeding. They were both Scythian Tribes, and the occurrence ofdeformity and the consequent necessity to steal peasant children to breed from,as the Church hinted, was negligible. In the context of accusations of wilfuland unnecessary perversity, where the Church accused the Elves of stealing humanchildren to eat, this is misinformation. Nevertheless, during times of hardship, such as the medieval period, whendisease and death were rife, necessity sometimes forced human communities toresort to cannibalism simply in order to survive. Instances of peasants beingdriven by circumstance to eat the flesh of condemned criminals are unequivocallyrecorded. The Elves did maintain the cult of the sacrificial king amongst their own adultpopulation, but the stealing of human children for these ritual purposes neveroccurred because they were of a different race. Nevertheless, here we have anexample of the kind of ecclesiastical deception that, in order to furtherbrainwash simple folk whom it had already conditioned by deception and terror tobe gullible, priests would use the idea of evil beings preying on children.During any period of history it seems that the “send five dollars and we'll stopthis man from shooting the puppy” approach to such a concept is alwaysguaranteed to elicit a highly-charged, emotional response from a poorlyculturally developed and badly educated public. In sheer terror they wouldtypically close ranks, toe the party line and reaffirm their loyalty to theestablishment and its easily digested morality. And what was the purpose of this kind of scapegoatism? To ratify social identityunder a specific ethical, cultural banner and thereby keep the charlatanpriesthood in full and gainful employment by using psychological terrorism toensure that they and their riches continued pouring in. The fascinating aspect to this kind of propaganda is that today it still worksjust as insidiously and effectively on people who like to think of themselves asmodern, intelligent sophisticates living in an enlightened and educated society,as it did on a medieval population. To all intents and purposes this kind ofindoctrination is fascism. Those familiar with the work of George Orwell willremember the scenario he presented in his novel 1984, where a totalitarianregime maintained social cohesion by pitting one social group against another. Now transpose this entire situation back to the Middle Ages and imagine how itmust have felt for the Elves who suffered exactly the same kinds of accusations,abuse and persecution for identical political aims. And now add to that theinevitable institutionalised rape and physical torture, and top the whole lotoff with a mandatory death penalty. The Church had instigated just such a relentless and insidious programme ofmilitant, psychotically hateful propaganda and persecution against the Elves. Itwas a rabid war of lies that attacked every level of their presumed behaviourand twisted every Fairy custom into an act of abomination ordered by theirsupposed master Satan himself. All the efforts of the Elves, the Church bleated, were ranged against the poorpeasant. Because of the abominable traditions of these evil and wicked Fairies,who had been the peasant's former friends and protectors, the poor peasant livedin fear for his very life and soul, and could only rely on comforting, forgivingMother Church for his physical protection and spiritual salvation. And what little recompense, what mere trifling consideration did the Churchexpect for so great a favour? Merely that the peasant should:a) manifest an appropriate amount of gratitude—and an appropriate amount ofguilt—for having the audacity to exist on a planet that, in belonging to “their”God, was therefore by association also the property of the Church,b) be ravaged by the fear of his own natural inclinations which, the priestsinstilled into him, were dirty and sinful.c) Lastly that he work a fifteen hour day, six and a half days a week, allowingtime off to go to Church, fifty two weeks a year. Furthermore, much of what little he had he paid in tithes, taxes and portablegoods to the priesthood who, though peasants themselves, were in fact making thepeasants' life more unbearable than any Fairy could. If Jesus could have seenthe atrocities and social injustices that these blood-soaked carrion wereperpetrating in his name, he would have turned in his grave. The Scythians didn't prey on peasants, merchants, human nobility or socalled“royalty” for reasons intimated previously: namely that in comparison, those notof the Fairy race had dead blood trickling through their veins. In their heyday the Fairies practised familial vampirism. In tandem, this, withtheir tradition of living with the remains of their ancestors in tomb or templeRaths, established the folk tradition which tells that the Vampires returnedfrom the dead—rose from the tombs—to feed from the blood and life force of theirliving relatives. During the Medieval and Reformation Periods this tradition was gleefullyexpanded upon and misreported by both the Roman and Protestant Churches, who areboth Catholic, and equally to blame for what has gone wrong. They gave theerroneous impression that Vampires, or indeed werewolves, could occur in anyfamily, peasant, merchant or otherwise, and that those families therefore wereconstantly in danger from their own departed. What kind of twisted mind would think up such a story and, not content to turnthe living against the living, brother against sister and husband against wife,would also turn the living against their own ancestors? This is deliberatealienation and disenfranchisement on a grand scale. On the death of a relative, life was sad enough. If the person was abreadwinner, life was precarious and uncertain enough in those days withouthaving some parasite propagating the kind of story that invested tragedy andgrief with menace. As one mourned someone once so dearly loved in life, in deaththey were then to become an object of loathing and dread. What we have here is a very disturbing group of people who will say or doanything for power. Even more disturbing is that they are still manipulating theminds of the people in Europe and America with variations of the same nonsensethey have always propagated, either themselves or through sympathetic orsycophantic governmental elites. They may have taken a back seat, but they'restill in power. Who will rid us of these pestilent priests? The king tribe, in much the same way as they selected their rulers and Druids,from an “Atheling Pool” of Brehon Families, also selected from this same group aclass of females who became known as “Grail Maidens”. These sacred, royalprincesses, virgins of High Birth and Pure Blood, at an optimum age would bechosen to act as feeding females. Giving willingly of their blood, fluids and energy, these girls were notmutilated, sacrificed or murdered during the process, but were worshipped andcherished as incarnations of the nurturing Dragon Goddess. Dea Vulna Gnosis—theGoddess Gives the Blood of Knowledge. In fact they were perceived as, and treated like, goddesses themselves. Theirrank was second only to the High Queens who, on attaining the traditional age,they themselves became. Women today should be so lucky. When fully mature, theGrail Maidens became Dragon Princesses and were encouraged to pick the cream ofthe princes and warlords for their pleasure. When contracted into lease marriages with their own kin they became the DragonQueens and the matriarchs of their people, the mothers of the next generation ofElven Queens and Kings. Such is a far cry from the treatment a Celtic womanmight expect to receive, who having but one office open to her and far lessphysiological capabilities than a Dragon Queen, was treated with less respectthan a brood mare. Status quo? The Fairies, though now thought of as obscure nature spirits, were at theforefront of Eurasian civilisation and included the PenDragons and their cousinsthe Merovingians. The decline and obscurity of the Fairy race was caused, as wehave seen, by the Roman Catholic Church who, unlike the now defunct CelticChurch, were the sworn enemies of the Grail or Fairy blood. The Celtic orDruidic Church was a priestly variant of the Middle Eastern branch of the Grailrace, the Dragon Kings. The word “Church” actually derives from “circa” and theold highland euphemism for going to the Kirk was “going to the stones”, meaningstone circle. The Messiahship, the rulership of the Christian Church was invested in Jesus asthe appointed son and rabbi and was intended, like Dragon Kingship, to descendin his bloodline. This it did through the Merovingian kings and the CelticChurch. In Britain, Jesus' granddaughter married the Archdruid Bran the Blessed,cementing a blood alliance between the Dragon and the Grail branches of the onegreater royal family, guided and protected by the Druidic Priests of the CelticChurch and the indigenous Druids of Britain. For reasons outlined in other works, Jesus' other brother James attracted afollowing consisting of Paul of Tarsus and Peter the Fisherman. This factionsettled in Rome with Paul and established itself eventually as the Roman Churchunder Constantine, which boasted Peter as the First Bishop of the ChristianChurch. However, as Vatican records show, Prince Linus of Britain was descendedfrom Jesus, and was therefore the First Bishop of the Christian Church followingChrist himself.Nevertheless, since then, the Roman heresy, the Catholic Church of the Dogma andnot the Blood, vied for ascendance. After its final victory in 664 AD at theCouncil of Whitby, it did everything in its power to steal authority andleadership from the rightful bloodline descendants who held it. As part of thisprocess in Europe, agreements were made with the Mayors of the Palacesaforementioned, and the Merovingians were either murdered or incarcerated as theChurch established these Mayors, the Carolingians, under them as puppet kings.After the Dark Ages the Roman Church became a ubiquitous and brutal power whichattempted the utter destruction of the true kings. Because of this relentlesscampaign, as the centuries have progressed we have been left to think of theFairies as the Church would wish us to think of them, as being anything otherthan what they really were. Hard pressed and in decline at this period, many in the outlying regions whocould not adjust to the new regime or assimilate themselves into a camouflagedposition simply took to the forests during the periods of the Church's worstexcesses. In their place and in the places of those the Church murdered, theyappointed farmer chieftains and tinkers from the Sudra class of Celtic Society,thus confusing the identities of the Scythians and the Celts. This allowed, inretrospect, a situation where it appears that the Celts trade off the earliercultural accomplishments of the Fairy race as if they were their own, therebypaving the way for glorious ersatz “Celtic Revivals” in the centuries to come! So whilst some members of the Fairy race of kings took refuge in deceit, manyothers took to the forests and lived in the obscurity and insularity of theGreenwood. This reinforced the ancient association between Fairies and thenatural world in folk memory. Such an association finds further reinforcement in the old Druidic lawsconcerning the reverence due to trees and nature in general which, to the Fairyqueens and kings with their transcendent perception, contained life in all itsmanifestations, a life of which they were the custodians. In the days of their ascendance the Fairies operated a system of landmanagement. It consisted of nomadic pastoralism and hunting, interspersed by thesettled agriculture of their Celtic clientele who tended the farmsteads inrotation. They accompanied their Fairy lords and ladies as they themselvestravelled seasonally between a central Sacred seat and three out of foursatellite Raths and their burghs or brocks which were arranged in a nomen, ormark of Cain circle-and-cross configuration. The advantage of this system, which gave rise to the folk tale of the “troopingFairies”, was that the regional game stock, the vegetation and the soil itselfwere allowed to recuperate and restore themselves in times allotted as beingfallow. For one year in four a whole region would lie fallow. A hangover fromthis tradition can be seen in the old “Norfolk Strip” style of crop rotation.The difference was that instead of resting strips of land in turn, the Fairiesrested whole districts, moving themselves and their clients from settlement tosettlement in turn as the year progressed. The traditional times to move were May Eve, Midsummer, Samhain and the return tothe centre was at Yule, revealing a quarturnal rotation when the Fairies couldbe seen and heard traversing the forests, hills and dales in joyous musicalprogressions filled with light and laughter. Such tales, surviving the brutalityand oppression of the medieval period, came down to us through folk tales untilthe last century. In Eire and Scotland, they were still common currency amongstthe rural communities who were wont to comment, as we have seen, that “if theElves die, the Land dies too”. To the Dragon Queens and Kings—the Fairies—were attached numerous epithets, someof which are included here, but are also the subject of another essay, wherethey are dealt with in detail. "},{"pageContent":" [images/00028.jpg] Chapter 5From Transylvania to Tunbridge Wells “The Fair Folk”Members of the Scythian Royal House were said to be of great beauty. We rememberthat they practiced selective breeding and that only the fairest and purestcould be selected as queens and kings. Tall in stature and with the palest ofcomplexions and the reddest of red gold hair, framing faces in which were seteyes of emerald green, these beings were magnificent to look upon, admittedly,but beauty is not just skin deep. Except to the fool. Beauty is a condition of the psyche. Where those who have suffered a life ofstress and tension, of bitterness and regret are concerned, we should not besurprised that they age more quickly or look uglier, and are more mean of spiritthat those whose lives have been led in truth and grace. Added to their stunning symmetry, the Elves were naturally transcendent ofspirit. Their queens and kings were insulated from the common round of nuisancesand petty concerns by minds which were bred for deeper matters. Add, then, aninner state of being whose grace and equilibrium is reminiscent of the grace ofthe gliding Swan, to a physical form of beauty attained by centuries ofselective breeding, and you obtain a being whose elegance and poise is nothingless than Otherworldly. Indeed, the Swan in Fairy culture not only represents an anatomical andphysiological condition within the Fairy brain, it also represents that veryserenity of being which neuro-physiology effects within the Fairy mind.Consequently, it is seen manifestly in the visage and deportment of that race'squeens and princesses and kings and princes, the Swan Maidens and Swan Knightsof legend. From Transylvania to Tunbridge WellsIn folklore such intimations of beauty come down to us in stories of Elf maidenswho, in reflecting such poise and charm as could only be manifest in enlightenedbeings, are portrayed as Swans on the evening waters of moonbathed lakes whoenthral the onlooker and captivate his soul forever. A perfect example of sucheulogised beauty is the story of the Leanaan Sidhe, an Irish female Fairy whohas developed in literature as being part muse and part Vampire. She representsthe state of grace and perfection of the Elven Princess. Memory, however, prompts those who tell of her to relate that her embrace isdeath. In Transylvania she is Stregoica; in Greece she is the Lamia; in Persia,Arabia and Israel she is Lilith and An, and just outside Tunbridge Wells she is“La Belle Dame Sans Merci”, immortalised in Keats’ poem of the same name. La Belle Dame Sans Merci Oh what can ail thee, Knight at arms,Alone and palely loitering?The sedge has withered from the LakeAnd no birds sing! Oh what can ail thee,Knight at arms,So haggard and so woe begone?The Squirrel's granary is fullAnd the harvest's done. I see a Lily on thy browWith anguish moist and fever dew,And on thy cheeks a fading RoseFast withereth too— I met a Lady in the Meads,Full beautiful, a faery's childHer hair was long, her foot was lightAnd her eyes were wild— I made a garland for her head,And bracelets too, and fragrant ZoneShe look'd at me as she did loveAnd made sweet moan— I set her on my pacing steedAnd nothing else saw all day longFor sidelong would she bend and singA faery's song— She found me roots of relish sweetAnd honey wild and manna dewAnd sure in language strange she saidI love thee true— She took me to her Elfin grotAnd there she wept and sigh'd full sore,And there I shut her wild wild eyesWith kisses four. And there she lulled me asleepAnd there I dreamed, Ah Woe betide!The latest dream I ever dreamtOn the cold hill side. I saw pale Kings and Princes tooPale warriors, death pale were they all;They cried, La belle dame sans merciThee hath in thrall. I saw their starv'd lips in the gloamWith horrid warning gaping wide,And I awoke, and found me hereOn the cold hill's side. And this is why I sojourn hereAlone and palely loitering;Though the sedge is withered from the LakeAnd no birds sing – —John Keats In England, during the 1300's, this Vampire maiden was to be found in the HomeCounties. Her name, the “Maid of Kent” identifies her as being, according toJohn Ferguson, the Countess of Salisbury. At a summer ball in Calais, she wassaid to have let slip her Garter. King Edward III retrieved it with haste and,lifting the accoutrement into the air, pronounced “Honi Soit Qui Mal Y Pense”. As to her wandering around near Tunbridge Wells, when the unfortunateknight-in-armour met her, she no doubt looked upon him as the medievalequivalent of tinned meat. She, like him, was returning from the Calaisfestivities when he must have caught up with her on the leafy track that has nowbecome the well-known A21. We will meet them again in a minute. Scholars once dismissed Professor Margaret Murray for several things. One wasthat the Garter incident elicited an over-reaction from Edward, assuming theGarter to be of no ritual significance. But however scholars may dismiss theincident, the question will not go away. In a period not noted for its moral rectitude, why would the King botherthreatening anyone in connection with their possible attitude towards an item ofwomen's underwear? Murray has already pointed out exactly how significant theGarter actually is and has given numerous instances to support a concept thatgoes beyond mere theory. There was no point in making a song and dance about theCountess' Garter unless the item had a dangerous connotation attached to it;which indeed it had. The Garter or Gartier was a small, buckled belt worn by women around the top ofthe left thigh or just below the left knee on men. Apart from being a menstrualbadge and a semantic symbol of the womb and the Grail, it was also arepresentation of the serpent eating its own tail. The Garter therefore was thealchemical symbol of the Orobourus, the serpent who, in consuming itself, hasbecome a Dragon, a Vampire. Here we will remember the opening prose at thebeginning of this collection of essays. The Garter was the “Witches belt”, the Devil's badge and a dynastic emblem ofthe Fairy race that descended from Lilith and Cain, who were the enemies of theChurch and Mankind, according to the Church, if not according to the Fairiesthemselves. The subsequent founding of the Order of the Garter by Edward III was followed in1399 by the re-emergence of the private foundation of the Dragon Court inanother related Angevin line under King Sigismund of Luxembourg. This underwentits public investiture in 1408. Both the orders of the Garter and the Dragonused the Orobourus as their emblems. The Garter, as the alchemical Orobourus, is still an emblematic component of theold Angevin Imperial and Royal Dragon Court today. Under the Grand Mastership ofits Vere heads is a senior heir of the senior Houses of Anjou and Lorraine whois himself a gartered knight of the Orcadian Clan Donnachaid. This demonstratesthe ubiquity of the Garter symbol amongst the ancient families. The Garterdenoted rank in later Witchcraft which, as we have seen, originated as Druidism. The Orobourus, the reptilian symbol of completeness is the Sumaire, the serpentthat encircles and spirals to create an inhaling vortex, a black hole that drawsall energy and life into it. Sumaire is pronounced shimmarie, as we have seen.In being reminiscent of the word shimmer, it suggests a relationship with thatword which means to glow radiantly as with a light that perhaps had the power tofascinate. It is a pertinent meditation when one remembers that from the dawn of time theElven Gods were called the Shining Ones. Here there is also a relationship withthe words Shaman and Shamanism, a practice rooted in Northern Asia, the homelandof the speakers of “Ar Sidhe Cantu”, being the Sundered Elven Tribe who wenteast. Like the legend of the fascinating allure of Fairy Gold, the Leanaan Sidhe andthe Countess of Salisbury appeared so beautiful as to disarm their prey with anenthralling inward glamour of glowing radiance. Having disarmed their victimsthus, they drew either the blood or the life force or both from them, leavingthem to wander forever, as Keats suggests, like living corpses in vain pursuitof a love and beauty so splendid, so transcendent and so complete. Fairy fascination is a universal theme. In this respect it suggests an innateability to hypnotise people, though this isn't the whole story. In the talesconcerning people's encounters with Elphame, there is a quality of transcendenceabout their narratives which will be dealt with later. Love on a Four Lane BlacktopThe element of translucence and light that is attributed to Fairies can also befound in the stories relating to the shamans and kings of Eldorado in SouthAmerica, where these individuals are also referred to as the “Shining Ones”.This is a common epithet, as we know, for the Elves of Eurasia. Jesus is said to have manifested this capability in the presence of thepatriarchs and such an ability is closely connected with the Qabalah in itsnumerous manifestations and variations. Both Jesus' mother Mary and his wifeMary Magdalene were called the “crystal wombs from whence shined forth the lightof god”, a description which suggests strongly the Tantric and Qabalisticconcept of Starfire. We return to the eulogised dual carriageway on the outskirts of TunbridgeWells—the A21—and our tired but patiently waiting traveller, the “Maid of Kent”,the Countess of Salisbury and the packed lunch she nestles so lovingly to herpale and perfect breasts. In her role as the Vampire we also find her, like theLeanaan Sidhe, described as a Fairy lover and, as the Garter Queen, a Witch intothe bargain. The Garter intimates that she is of the Dragon Clan and hence we have the Fairy,the Witch, the Vampire and the Dragon in one unitary identity manifest in avision of fatal and deadly beauty. We will leave this Shamanka to “steal the edge” and leave, consigning herportion of Corned Beef to wander the Earth looking for her and the return of hismortal soul. He had not understood the implications of true love, which laterbecame hideously distorted in Gothic novels and films. Such characters as the English Countess of Salisbury and the Irish Leanaan Sidhein historical accounts are sometimes remorseful and cursing of the nature thatcondemns them to utter loneliness. Sometimes they are unrepentant, predatory andwithout remorse. It depends upon the motivation of the chronicler as to who does and feels what.It has been pointed out that the Knight in the poem, which Keats obtained from afar earlier source, might have transcended himself, and looked the way he didpurely to outsiders, whilst living in an entirely different dimension himself.Having said that, the pain is all too real and the act of “stealing the edge” byDragon Princesses is actually what does awaken the Vampire in the Fairy. It isdoubtful in the very rare instances where this still can sometimes happen, thatthese females know what they are doing. Instead they act archetypically, liketheir ancestors, as an unconscious but necessary catalyst in a process ofspiritual development. For anybody's money, this could lose nothing of itsimpact by being a bit more gentle. One might imagine that seven years of livinghell and a hunger unquenched by raw steak, pastrami or Carlsberg Special Brew ismuch too much to have to pay for enlightenment. However, the author, amongst others, has always insisted upon a biochemicalbasis for magic and transcendent states, and the psychobiological basis for suchphenomena. This includes vampirism and the enlightenment that is itsconcomitant. It can be explained scientifically, without relying on such oldfavourites as Iron Deficiency Porphyria or on any of the other nonsenses thatoutsiders have suggested. “The Shining Ones”If you are a cheery Elf and you have managed to avoid the excesses of behaviourand perception brought about by contact with your female counterparts inElphame, you might qualify for the epithet of “Shining One”. If you haverealised to any extent that you are of the Clan, you will know that from thevery beginning the Fairies were called the “Shining Ones”. This stems from the Sumerian era when “The Controllers of the Fate of Men” wereknown as both the Anunnaki and the Anunnagi. The former means “those who aremanifest when Heaven meets Earth” and the latter means simply “Shining Ones” or“Star Children”. They mean the same and refer to the nocturnal habits of ourancestors as much as anything else. These habits are directly related to theproduction and maintenance of certain hormones, which then relate to the coremeaning itself. In particular the epithet “Shining One” was appended to Prince Shimash, brotherof Erishkigal, Queen of the Otherworld. Shamash was the uncle of Lilith and wasalso called the “Prince of Justice”. The Fairies from very early on were much infavour of law and order. This is a trait which manifested itself in an attentionto detail in social and legal matters that has earned them, as Vampires, areputation in later centuries for being pathologically meticulous. "},{"pageContent":" In Transylvania it is said that if you dropped grain in front of a Vampire, itwould stop to count the individual seeds, thus facilitating your speedy escapefrom danger. We may put this down to the wit and wisdom of peasant sarcasm, butwe note the point all the same. Shamash was therefore of the family of Sumerian UbaidGods who sired Cain andKali Azura, and the race of Dragon Kings who were the keepers of the “Tablets ofDestiny” or Fate. In their turn Cain and Lilith Luluwa were the father andmother of the Fairies: the Elven Grail Queens and Kings of the Dragon race sohated by the Church. The ability to “shine”, a phenomenon which can still be subjectivelyexperienced, is the result of a transcendent, balanced state of mind related tocertain processes connected with cellular rejuvenation. The ability is rareenough and is an innate genetic capacity manifested in the outworking of certain“shamanic” exercises related to “climbing the Tree of Life”. “The Gentry”Gentry is a word which specifically means “of the blood” and is derived from theLatin gens. In this case, as in all cases, gentry strictly used to mean “of theFairy blood” or of the Dragon family. By misuse, the word gentry has becomerelated to a class or station, particularly in British society, and iserroneously associated, by attribution to the characters within that class, witha style of behaviour and a code of conduct that bears no resemblance tohistorical actuality. In its most basic sense, the word “gentle” as in gentleman or gentlewoman, inBritish society, refers to individuals who are associated with, and gain statusthrough and erroneous recognition from, their support of a hierarchical valuesystem. This had been established illegally by the Church through the Tudorusurper Henry VIII, under the auspices of the earlier Roman doctrines oftemporal supremacy expounded within the fraudulent Donation of Constantine. However, the British establishment, either through its Courts of Protocol,College of Arms or its academic or judicial establishments, has absolutely nolegal or legitimate customary right to recognise or refute anybody or anythingand their qualification, via such institutions. Its right to determine who is oris not royal or of the blood is non-existent, as they are not “of the blood”themselves. However, their blanket refusal to recognise any European titlewhatsoever has some redeeming element to it. The House of Vere doesn't recogniseanyone else either! This includes the Crown, its Court of St. James and itsCollege of Arms. There is no reason to do so. A prime example of the concept of nobility being affected by the merchants canbe seen in Renaissance Venice which, for all its splendour and seeming nobility,was no more than a fancy but rather damp, giant warehouse, run by self-elevatedtradesmen who called themselves “Patricians”. In 1998 the transient public servant Mr. Blair wished to scrap hereditaryprivilege and replace the hereditary peers with new lords, doing exactly this inNovember 1999. Seventy-five percent of the old lords obtained their hereditarytitles from ancestors who were the settled merchants who had bought their titlesfrom impecunious monarchs like Henry VIII or James VI. The remaining twenty-fivepercent were descended mostly from the bully boys who accompanied the usurpingbastard William of Normandy. He had been recognised by his own nobles only underthe duress exacted upon them by his father. The remainder of the entourage present at the Hastings debacle were comprised ofFlemish and Breton nobles, some of whom had lived in England for many years.Assessing the risk of backing their friend Harold Godwinson, they resignedthemselves to the unpleasant but inevitable fact that he would lose, and wentalong to ensure that the ignorant Norman buffoon did not give away their Englishlands to his marauding henchmen. Amongst these was Eustace de Vere, Jarl of Essex and brother-in-law of Edwardthe Confessor. On Harold's death, Vere was pronounced King of England by theWitan. This made Eustace's right to the English throne unquestionable underSaxon Atheling Law. The illegitimate invader was so frightened of Eustace thathe took hostages prior to the invasion in order to ensure Eustace's complicity. The de jure Kingship of England has, therefore, descended through the Veres forover 900 years. In 1560 Edward de Vere gave the Tudors a timely and friendly,though somewhat esoteric reminder of this fact. No one wanted William de Normandy. All he did in seizing the throne of Englandwas commit an act of theft and treason accompanied by torture, rape, murder andyet more theft and treason. And what are the “new lords” now that this Blairperson has got his own way? More scrap dealers, bully boys and warehousemen,elevated in payment for their political sycophancy and installed as partyYes-Men. Why bother making the change? What's the difference? The codes of conduct and styles of behaviour developed over the centuries bythese misfits and usurpers have come to be thought of as the manners of the“gentry”. Such etiquette and standards of behaviour are, however, rather of thenature of a complex set of rules and protocols which have evolved from thenecessity for these individuals to reinforce to themselves and each other theirsense of identity. This need is born of the insecurity of the usurper and theposeur. The party games were initiated to ensure that those who refuted suchmores or refused to adopt them were “excluded”. In recent history Nancy Mitford assisted in the development of a list of suchstyles of speech, patronage and behaviour which one of her nephews published ina book entitled Noblesse Oblige, which this author has looked through. Withinits pages were lists of the “U” and non “U” words, affectations, preferredschools, clubs and so on. By their patronage or utilisation by others, the fakearistocracy could determine whether any individuals they encountered were “oursort of people”, i.e. whether they were “U” or non “U”, meaning “Upper-class” or“Non upper-class”. What a cheek! This does not sit particularly well with thefact that the British Fascist leader, Oswald Mosley, had strong connections tothe Mitford family. Situations similar to the foregoing represent yet another example of how thechattering classes, the sons and daughters of arriviste tradesmen masqueradingas gentry, hide behind their sham rituals and money. They hope that, as theyears drift languorously by, people will forget that they were all descendedfrom those whom the Scythians, the real nobility and royalty, despised for beingliars and cheats. When interviewed, Mitford said that the book was just a joke. Surprising thenthat these ridiculous social rules were rife amongst her “class” before shewrote them down and that they were indeed used to determine whether one was fitcompany for their pseudo-aristocratic “society” or not. Today sociologists are doing exactly the same thing by using classificationnumbers to determine one's social status. One could be anything from say—an A1category “social unit”—all the way down to a G3. These numbers are appended toone according to one's job and income. For instance, hilariously enough and for no good reason the author can think of,a film star is an A1 “social unit”, whilst a dustman is something like a G2. Interms of social value and input one would have thought that the dustman wouldhave been somewhere up in the high B's at least, by quasiMarxist sociologists'standards. If film stars went on strike for six months would you suffer more than ifdustmen went on strike for six months? Of course not. If dustmen took the sameamount of time out the country would be swimming in bacteria and disease. Iffilm stars went on strike, you would just watch repeats on television or buy atalking parrot or a performing monkey. What difference is there in terms ofskill or in terms of social contribution, after all? Whether they are Marxist or Weberan sociologists or whatever, they are the worstmanifestation of middle-class attitudes, because it is only the middle classeswho would differentiate between themselves and other classes. This is how youknow they aren't Gentry. The ancient gentry knew the value of a person's contribution to society andrespected the person for making it. The true gentry weren't above grabbing ashovel when the need arose and mucking in and mucking out with everyone else.Only the elevated tinkery would expect someone else to do the work. Only thetinkery would think that, because they had risen so far in their own estimationof themselves, the world owed them a living. The Elven Queens and the Dragon Kings, the real gentry of history, had noparticularly complex hierarchy with which to stratify or differentiate rankamongst themselves. They simply knew that they were all of the Fairy blood andwere thus equal. This is apparent in both the social structures of the d'Anu ofEire and the Royal Danes of Scandinavia as late as 900 AD. The present scheme of things, which descends from the medieval feudal system,was developed by the succession of various dynasties of tinker royalty inBritain and Europe. We can see this insulating, snobbish mentality at work withits “layers” of rank, determining “layers” or “degrees” of nobility or royalty.In the Merovingian and Pictish Danaan cultures, one was a king or princess andthat was that. All shared the Sang Real and the San Graal, that is the HolyBlood, from which Holy Grail is derived. Whether or not you reigned wasimmaterial. Nowadays the British throne is occupied by the descendant of a foreign familyalmost arbitrarily selected for a task in which, to all intents and purposes,they find themselves merely an impotent figurehead. Under this individual thereis stratified a complex series of ranks, orders and accolades which,historically, were anyone's for the taking, as long as they had money; and whichtoday you can still buy into at the lowest rung by paying the College of Arms£1,800. If you can prove to them that you have “made a contribution to society” eitherby getting a university degree or by having been trained to kill people, a nicecoat of arms is yours for the asking. You will then be an official Esquire.Henceforth (though not beforehand, one assumes) you will be considered to be “AGentleman” because you have a pretty piece of paper saying as much. In Irelandthe Chief Herald's Office formerly issued applications for armorial bearing uponwhich it was stipulated that the supplicant must be considered by the ChiefHerald to have reached “The Portal of Gentry”. How can anyone “reach the portal of gentry”? How can there be a “doorway toblood”? This is yet another instance where language is eloquently engineered tobecome completely ineloquent nonsense. Every year the arguably unqualified monarch hands out knighthoods and orders, tounworthies who are chosen at the fawning whim of some transient, jumped-uppublic servant. They go mainly to self-seeking individuals who have been thoughtto have made a “contribution” to society. Many of these knighthoods go toaverage actors, football managers and industrialists. Both the former havealready been paid a more than adequate amount of cash for their dubious andineffectual contributions. The latter have likewise also been paid adequatelyfor their self-seeking contribution and have also assisted, by their greed, inturning the planet into an orbiting swill bin. Why are these people being rewarded for serving themselves and how can theypossibly be thought of as behaving like “gentry”, when the most that they do isproduce useless consumer junk, infotainment and pollution? They have become richby creating jealousy, envy and enmity. Through the media their dissemination ofdouble standards has created a level of moral confusion which has inevitably ledto further social and economic division and environmental damage. And for thisthey get an “honour”. One of the most lamentable investitures of the Most Noble Order of the Garterrecently went to Margaret Thatcher, a grocer's daughter. Another went to EmperorHirohito, the head of a country whose government refused, for forty years, torecognise their nation's responsibility for the treatment of civilians—whom theyused in chemical warfare tests—and prisoners of war whom they forced to work totheir deaths in military building operations. In the first case, how can a grocer's daughter be thought of as suitablematerial for inclusion in an order that was so strictly intended for those ofthe royal blood. In the second case, how can one of the most hated enemies ofthe British people in recent history qualify either? The Most Noble Order of the Garter had already been defiled down through thecenturies by its association with a motley assortment of pseudoroyal dynasts whohad no right to belong to it. It was bad enough that the Windsors had no rightto confer it on anyone else. However, membership reached its lowest ebb whenthose two individuals were awarded it. The Most Noble Order of the Garter is Britain's premier Order of Knighthood. Infact, heraldically speaking, it's actually the second in rank to the ancientCaledonian Dragon Court that spawned it. The very word “knight”, stemming fromthe Saxon cnecht, means “to serve” or a “servant”. It was and still is an Angevin and hence an Elven bloodline institution. On thedeath of Richard III therefore, all rights to continue to own the Order of theGarter died out in his line and by the Laws of Sovereign inheritance the Orderthen belonged to the senior heirs of the House of Anjou. Neither Hirohito nor Thatcher did anything to deserve to be invested withBritain's most senior rank of knighthood. It is an exercise of the worstmanifestation of the bourgeois mentality to direct Her Majesty to give out suchdegrees. In Thatcher’s case it appears to be to pay off a favour to a fellowmember of the bourgeoisie. In Hirohito’s it appears to be to kow-tow fordiplomatic reasons to a nation simply because it has become economicallysuccessful. This is especially so when the present dynasty, it could be argued,appear to have no historical right to give the Order in the first place. Her Majesty's intelligent son Prince Charles has publicly lamented the declinein standards in the English language for years. Even he would no doubt alsoquestion how can anyone “become” a gentleman, a member of the gens—the SanGraal, and how can a piece of paper instantly make one into a member of aseparate race. The real “gentry”, or to give them another familiar epithet—the Lords andLadies—were just that. They were by blood alone, the members of a geneticstrain, the Dragon and Grail families—the Fairy Blood. One could not and cannot“become” a member of the gentry any more than one can “become”, by initiation orotherwise, a “Witch”, a “Vampire”, a “Magus”, a “Dragon”, a “Fairy” or an “Elf”. These are all terms which described the “gentry”. The latter—Elf—is a word whichoriginates from albi, meaning a white or “shining one”. From albi derives theFrench Cathar name Albigensian (Albi + Gens), meaning “of the Elven blood”—etquid erat demonstrandum. The PhariseesThis curious and delightful name for the Elven race is a common English ruralfolkword probably created by the addition of an extra syllable to the wordFairies, thereby making a double plural suffix. Pharisees is simply Fairies-es,a bit like Tolkien's double plural “pocketses”, attributed to his character“Gollum” in Lord of the Rings. A more obscure possible origin for the Pharisee epithet however, may be found inthe nature of the Elves themselves. Some of their families were from mixedPictish and Merovingian bloodlines. Where the latter is concerned, it descendedfrom Jesus and had a Pharisaic origin. The word Pharisee itself stems from theHebrew parush, meaning “separated”, which by blood the Elves indeed were. In this particular context we should also remember the Celtic Church which wasNestorian and Pharisaic in its doctrine and structure. The Celtic Churchsupported the Fairy bloodline of Jesus. At the same time it had strong Druidicassociations, to the point, in fact, where Jesus himself was considered to havebeen a Druid and a Magus by his British kinsmen—the Elven PenDragons. The PlantagenetsAccording to their own account of themselves and the accounts of subsequentchroniclers and historians, including Professor Vivian Green, the Plantagenetswere descended from the Fairy race. Certainly they shared a common Scythiantrait when riled, and that was a vile temper! The Plantagenets, whose name was thought to derive from “plantagenista”—the“plant of generation” or “Tree of Life”—used a sprig of the Broom, the“plantagenista”, as one of their earlier family badges. The seeds of the Broomplant are hallucinogenic and were a well-known part of the Witches'pharmacopoeia throughout the Dark Ages and the Medieval Period. It was said that the Plantagenets had two ancestral grandmothers, one namedMelusine, the daughter of King Elinus of Albany, and the other the daughter ofBaldwin du Bourg, King of Jerusalem. The Plantagenets derived their name from a princess named Plantina (possiblyderived from Plantanu or Planta-Anu). She was actually the younger sister ofMaelasanu des Scythes or Melusine McLean. This obviously means that thePlantagenets were not actually directly descended in the male line from Melusineherself. In a matriarchal Pictish system of inheritance, she was the seniordaughter of King Gille Sidhean of Albany, and the heir of her mother, QueenPressina, or more formally The Queen BruidheAnu des Scythes. Melusine certainly was the matriarch of the Angevin or Anjou dynasty. However,her senior heir and the first Count of Anjou was Maelo de Vere, not Tortolf deRennes. This means the Plantagenet dynasty descended from the younger sisterPlantanu, a junior branch of the Imperial and Royal House of Vere. The Veres left Anjou in 800 AD and the Comite of Anjou was divided and, atlength, settled upon the heirs of Tortolf. This gave the erroneous impressionthat they were the first and therefore senior branch of the Angevin familywhich, according to the records, is simply not the case. The second Melusine was in fact called Melisend. Therefore the Plantagenets hadno direct male connection with any Melusine at all, despite the attempts ofsubsequent royal genealogists and amateur historians to make it so. Neverthelessthe Plantagenets, our younger Vere cousins, were still of the Blood Royal and ofElven Stock. The discrepancies in their story add to, rather than detract from,their claims or the claims made for them. The popular, chronicled descent claimed for the Plantagenets from Melusine wasin fact via a cadet female Vere line—that of Ida de Vere—a member of anotherjunior branch of the Vere family, specifically the Imperial and Royal House ofVere of Constantinople and Jerusalem. Ida de Vere was the aunt of theinaugurator of the Knights Templar, the Swan Knight Godfroi de Vere de Bouillon.She was also the ancestral granddaughter of Prince Maelo de Vere d'Anjou. Hismother was the much-coveted Princess Maelasanu McLean de Vere des Scythes, viaAdolph de Vere de Guisnes. The Plantagenets could however claim a line of unbroken male descent from thelate 800's until the sad death in 1485 of Richard III—argued by some to be thelast true King of England. This junior branch of the family managed to survivefor about 600 years, which was a respectable length for an era. Since then, theBritish have suffered a succession of nondescript Church puppets who, out ofgenerosity, one might call eighth-breeds at best. With the death of Richard III the Garter died out in the junior Plantagenetline. It became, as a dynastic family, the Order of the House of Anjou, and thelegitimate property of the already Gartered Imperial and Royal House of Vere ofOxford (the legitimate kings of England by the will of the English peoplethemselves). It was later to descend to the Scottish and Irish Branches, thelatter whose seniority, on the death of the Vere Clan Chief, Lord AdrianHope-Vere—Laird of Blackwood—became confirmed in 1973. Melusine's father, Elinus or Gille Sidhean; was a descendant of the Ulster RoyalHouse of the Uilidian, the Fir Bolg Druids. Her mother was a bruidhe orjudge-poetess of Pictish royal descent from the Bruidhainn or (by Roman error)Cruthainn remnant of the Tuadha d'Anu or Tuatha de Danaan, as they were latercalled. These were the Aes Dan or Aesir Danaan, the Elven Gods of Eire and the Lords ofthe Calle Daouine of Caledonia or Northern Pictavia. Melusine was a DragonPrincess, a Lamia, and we will tell her story later. The Plantagenets or Angevins became, after their demise, a much sought afterbloodline to be descended from. It was as if it were implicitly understood thatreal Dragon blood made real queens and kings. Queen Elizabeth I, the greatgranddaughter of a Welsh farmer and Margaret, Countess of Anjou, had broom podmotifs sewn onto one of her gowns in celebration and assertion of her Anjouancestry. She is known to have had two coronations, the first and most important of whichwas a pagan, “Fairy” coronation held in public on the Mayday prior to her Churchinvestiture as Queen of England. Following this event Edward de Vere, 17th Earlof Oxford, staged the Windsor Stag Ride incident and killed the beast before theQueen as a gentle reminder of who the real Kings of England and the Greenwoodwere. Even today the biographers of the present constitutional Heads of State ofBritain proudly boast of that family's Anjou descent. The author thereforesupposes that we, the senior heirs of the senior branch of that dynasty, shouldbe flattered, despite the fact that such a descent is tortuous in the extremeand traces a line therefore, that looks as crooked as a donkey's hind leg. Boasting something like 2000 connections to Edward III, who was only a member ofa junior Anjou line, the present British Royal family that is originally aGerman farming family, is outranked in terms of blood even by the Spencers.Their daughter, the late Princess Diana, could claim 4000 connections to thesame character. Furthermore, one geneticist recently working with the bloodsamples of German royal and noble families couldn't find one whose male linereverted any farther than the early 16th century. "},{"pageContent":"[images/00016.jpg]Chapter 6 Dragon’s Deep Edmund Spenser is said to have flattered Queen Elizabeth I by writing a poemdedicated to her called “The Faerie Queen”. However it is equally possible thathis was a veiled reference to the Fairy wife of the alchemist, the Earl ofDesmond. Spenser and Sir Walter Raleigh resided at his seat—Castle Matres—duringan expedition to retrieve the Wizard's library from a war zone on behalf of Dr.John Dee. Castle Matres or Matrix, as it is now known, was said to have been named afterthe Matres or triple goddess. The castle rests on the banks of the river Deal inCounty Limerick and the library which was housed there is said to have containedsingular works on Magic and Alchemy. These were works that Dee didn't want,under any circumstances, to fall into the Queen's hands. The reason for thiswas, as Laurence Gardner has pointed out, that Dr. John Dee, Edward de Vere,Francis Bacon, Edmund Spenser, and William Shakespeare et al were well awarethat Elizabeth's house was full of badly bred usurpers. Also, despite thedescent from Margaret of Anjou, the blood was not pure. I wonder what the boyswould have made of the successive generations of farmers made monarchs. Plantagenet descent, and the Fairy blood that ran in the veins of Edward III inparticular, appears to have been greatly desired to legitimise the subsequentclaims of the dynasties that superseded them. However, the Plantagenetsthemselves, and Edward I in particular, looked to Scotland to legitimise theirown claims to kingship. Scottish and Irish Dragon Kings were invested on theStone of Scone. This Stone—the Lia Fail—the Stone of Destiny (or Fate) of the Tuadha d'Anu oncerested at the summit of the Hill of Tara, the ancient seat of the Elven HighKings in County Meath. When the Milesian Dalriada left Eire for Scotland it isbelieved that they took the Lia Fail with them. Edward I used his best efforts to conquer the Scots and wrest from them the LiaFail—the ultimate symbol of royal legitimacy. This confirms, one suspects, hisright to Fairy kingship which, retrospectively he had anyway. He was thuswasting his time. The Stone of the Elves never once rested under the gildedcommode in Westminster Abbey. Because the Raven-Stone of the Phoenicians wasn't the Stone of Scone that EdwardI stole, this fake lump of rock that the English thought was the Lia Fail wasnonchalantly and unceremoniously driven up to Edinburgh Castle in the back of aLand Rover. Even select members of the Order of the Golden Dawn knew this over ahundred years ago and descriptions of the Lia Fail can still be found in theliterature of their successors. Part of the later Plantagenet ancestry included the descendants of the DanishJarl, Rollo Duke of Normandy. The senior Angevin dynasty—the Vere—also have theViking Rollo as an ancestor in the female line. The word “Viking” has been explained in various ways. Originally spelt “Wicking”it was thought to derive from the word “wic”, meaning the inlet or mouth of aFjord, whilst the earlier meaning of the word from the Old Friesian and OldEnglish had “wic” as an encampment. In Russia, however, the “Vikhr” was awhirlwind, a manifestation of the Zmei or Dragon king which is dealt with later. The Vikhr is a character which is common to both the Russians and the Irish. Itwill be remembered that Russia was actually founded by the Viking Ruotsi Clan,intimating that the actual definition of the word “Viking” is the same as theIrish word “Sumaire”, a Dragon and a Vortex. Anciently, the Danes and the Danaan were closely related and an examination ofthe Royal Clan in both cultures will reveal the same egalitarian system ofself-regulation that distinguished the Danaan from the rest of Celtic society.The similarity does not end here. Like their Fairy cousin defenders in Irelandand Scotland, the Danes warriors were utterly indifferent to death and foughtwithout mercy. Their overall belief system engendered behaviour that appears tohave been almost nihilistic and devoid of any moral conflict. This system, based on the “Nine Worlds” or emanations of being, was duplicatedin earlier or contemporary variants of the Qabalah and Kaula Tantra. As with theformer, where the spheres or Sephira were incorporated into the Hebrew “Tree ofLife”, the Viking spheres or worlds were thought to rest within the branches ofa tree which, in the Norse, was called Yggdrasil, the World Ash Tree.Yggdrasil's roots were embedded in Hel or the Underworld, whilst its branchesbrushed against the stars of Heaven. Yggdrasil is a shamanic glyph which represents the macrocosm—the universe bothsubtle and material—and the microcosm—the human body. The tree glyph itself inall cultures represents the path the shaman takes, from the roots, embedded inmatter, up the trunk and into the branches and the stars, to the rarefiedspiritual spheres and beyond, to unite with godhead itself. Such a journey inevitably must transcend mundane care, fear, greed, opinion ormorality, and he or she who embarks upon and completes such a journeysuccessfully becomes united with the One Unmanifest, the True Will and the TotalSelf. As we shall see later, the Tree is actually a woman, a goddess incarnateor Avatar. The individual who completes the journey is beyond mortal conditioning or theshort-sighted relativity upon which is based human moral law. This system andits results duplicate themselves in many other mystical systems and in earlyWitchcraft in particular. Perhaps therefore, when considering the behaviour or attitudes of theindividuals in cultures such as those of the Danes and the Danaan, it might bemore apposite if scholars took more into account the effects that philosophicalsystems like these actually had on people like the Norse. They could thenrethink the etymology of the word “Viking” or “Wiccing”, before settling on ananswer that smacks of over-specialisation. In tandem with their Aryan Hindu cousins, the Vikings used the symbol of theSwastika. An example of its utilisation by the Norse can be found in Iceland,whose early inhabitants emblazoned the blue Swastika sacred to Kali Azura or“Blue Kali”, the sister of the Sumerian Cain or Qayin. Variants of this figure,the hammer of Thor, <fig 1>, earlier a copper, single-headed labrys or tomahawkcommon to the Ubaid, which is the shape of <fig 2>, spinning and creating thevortex, the spiral storm or tornado, can also be found at numerousarchaeological sites including Newgrange in its early spiralised form, <fig 3>.This is the spiral design of the Sumaire of Sumeria. In its variant form, <fig4>, the Swastika, represents the curved Scythian sword reaping the whirlwind. The Swastika is also found reversed, <fig 5>, and both forms respectively arethought to be moon and sun symbols. As the author will continue to reiterate,when reading on such subjects, particularly in relation to the philosophy of theDruids and other Indo-European, Aryan philosophies, it is wise to bear in mindthat the teachings and symbols operate on both the macro and microcosmic levelsat the least. Often the symbolism is in fact multi-faceted. In the case of the Swastika, the moon and sun symbolism applies inasmuch as thesun radiates or pushes energy out whilst the moon draws energy to it in the formof the sun's rays. Its gravitational field also pulls the tides. The <fig 6> ofKali is the Sumaire, the whirlpool which is the sucker-in of blood and energy,and like the moon it draws the suns rays and sucks up the tides, whilst <fig 5>, the solar Swastika, symbolises the donor or benefactor who gives willingly oftheir essence. [images/00074.jpg]<Fig 5> Exhale <Fig 6> = Inhale If we look closely we will also notice that the circular Swastika is the mark ofLilith given to Cain and also the mark of Kali. In their original form, theyrepresent the scythe of the reaper <fig 8>, the Golden Sickle of the Druidsspinning on its hilt. Therefore <fig 8> is also <fig 9>. The Swastika hasanother three-armed form which appears again at Newgrange and also as the badgeof the Fairy king Manannan Mac Lir, Lord of the Isle of Man, <fig 10> and Lordof the Waters of the Sea. As <fig 11>, it compares to the Dragon's eye of thesouth , <fig 12>, and also <fig 13>, the Dragon's eye of the north. In thenorthern hemisphere, mimicking the pull of the whirlpool, the rotation of thesedevices is to the left as you look at them, or clockwise from the point of viewof the one summoning the Sumaire in themselves. If we think of the Swastika as being a turbine, the position of the arms, either<fig 5> or <fig 6>; or <fig 11> or <fig 13>, indicates not the direction ofrotation, but the angle at which the blades are set. The difference between thefour and three armed Swastika is that the four armed essentially represents thesowing or reaping of “the four winds”, the pneuma, the spiritual or morphicenergy, whilst the three armed cross, the Swastika of Manannan of the waters,represents sowing (donating) or reaping (removing) the blood and waters of theFountain of Life—The Holy Grail. [images/00054.jpg] The pineal gland is so-called because it is similar in shape to a pinecone. TheDragon's eye of the north <fig 13> looks similar to the plan view of athree-sided pyramid and also represents the pineal gland that controls thesecretion of the mystical fluids. In relation to the pineal gland the Grail issymbolised by the sacred head, the Baphomet or source of wisdom. [images/00048.jpg] Related to the Solar disc and the Ajna Chakra in Tantra, in Mithraism this stageof the Grail process is represented by the Dragon of the sun. Therefore here thethree-armed Swastika is the Dragon's eye of the north <fig 13>, representing thepine cone shape of the pineal gland and also the 15th letter of the Hebrewalphabet, Ayin <fig 14>, the 15th path of the Tarot—the Devil— and the number ofIshtar or Venus in the roll of the seniority of the Gods. The Ayin is the “AllSeeing Eye of God” (Enki or Samael), peering both in and out of the void. At the end of their journey from the brain, through its third ventrical, downthe spinal column to the womb, Graffenberg gland and urethra, the fluids resthere until naturally or manually discharged. The womb becomes the Grail Cupcontaining the waters of life, the Cubic stone of the Philosophers. The Dragon'seye of the south <fig 12> = <fig 15>—the Cup. Thus the Grail, amongst otherthings, is both the Head and the Cup, and both “eyes” of the Dragon—north andsouth—are the eyes that contain “The light that illumines the human spirit”. Itis also the pineal gland, the Delta or Hebrew Daleth or Tau—The Doorway to theeternal. In any form the Swastika is an emblem of life, of breathing (the breath ofRavens) and of self-sacrifice. As such, therefore, the Swastika is one of theprimeval symbols of Priest-Kingship and Dragon Maidenhood. Greatly to beabhorred, then, is the fact that the Nazi Party of Germany hijacked the Swastikaof Kali and, along with numerous other Fairy symbols, made it the most hated andfeared glyph on the Planet. The Death's Head of the SS is the head of wisdom of the Templars—theBaphomet—whilst the Sig rune itself is the path of the serpent of wisdomdescending the Tree of Life. The red banner, with the white circle and blackSwastika, represents the bloody funeral ground of the Aryan saints. They gavethe last drop of their life's blood to Kali, represented by the white disc ofthe moon amidst the crimson field of the banner and whose Swastika is theSumaire, drawing life into it as the Moon draws the seas to her. The red flag isthus intended to represent the self-sacrificing Tantric priests of the KaulaVama Marg shedding the last vestige of their egos and their lives, to be leftdrained. As empty vessels, they were then ready to be filled with the wisdom ofthe Cosmos and with the power of the Siddhis. In practice, however, the Swastika represents the suffering of four millionpeople sacrificed to the stupidity of a nation duped into thinking that adysfunctional Yiddish house painter and a disaffected chicken farmer, leading adoomed race of potato peasants, could really be the vestige of the AryanPeoples: their so-called Master Race. And as I have already said here: theJudaic Culture, at its very root and heart, is Aryan in origin. Its ancient godsand goddesses were Aryan, its iconography is Aryan, its mythology is Aryan andits Royal House was Aryan. Even the hated so-called Star of David (properly theShield of David) is a form of the Swastika. From the following chart,demonstrating the Grail Myth of the Lady Marcella, the reader will see that theDeath’s Head, beloved of the Nazis, is equal and identical to the Shield ofDavid in a precise Hermetic sense. [images/00008.jpg] Those recalling the Templar myth of Maraclea will remember that the Skull isMale, whilst the Crossed Bones are Female. In much the same way as the Triangleon its base is the Male alchemical symbol of Fire, the Triangle on its point isthe Female alchemical symbol of Water. Combined, we see that they comprise theexoteric, international symbol of Judaism. Now, the Swastika in exoteric Hinduism is split into two arms, one being femaleand one being male. They too represent the magical elements of fire and watercombined and thus the Swastika is exactly one and the same as the so-called Starof David. And here lies the utter stupidity of racist ideology and jingoism. TheJewish Holocaust replicates exactly what happened to the Elven families for overa thousand years and for exactly the same reasons. Money and power. The Fairy progeny, in small pockets, spanned the Earth from as far distant asJapan* to Scotland. They rarely mixed with the indigenous populations whoinvited their rule and their wisdom. Germans, like any other tribe would havehad their Aryan caste to guide them but that doesn't entitle a whole nation toconsider itself Aryan. *The Ainu of Hokkaido or North Island are a tall, fair-skinned Caucasoid people,thought to have been the original inhabitants of the Japanese Islands who weredriven north by waves of immigrants from China, Korea and South Asia. The Ainu(pronounced: Eye-Noo) are animistic and shamanic and share many beliefs with theAmerindians and the Scythian Druids concerning the nature of life. Theirprincipal divine totem is the Swan. During the 12th century the Ainu were almostextinct following continued hostilities with invaders. Their mythology tellsthem that their race was saved by a Swan which descended from heaven and matedwith the last living Ainu Lord. This coupling produced the Ainu who still occupyHokkaido today. The Swan Maidens are the Dragon Princesses of the Grail, the Scythian DruidQueens and the Nordic Andvarinauts. In Irish lore they can transform from Swansinto maidens and so, anthropologically speaking, it would appear. The assertionis supported by academics that the Ainu, born of the womb of a Swan Maiden, areof the Royal, Elven Dragon Blood—the Blood of Anu! The Ainu have dark hair andalmond eyes and are distinctly Asian despite their complexions. Nevertheless,the remnant of the Ainu who retain pure blood, of which no more than seventeenthousand are left, are of Aryan extraction. So much for the 20th centuryblue-eyed, blonde-haired German fantasy. The pure, insular Ainu have more rightto the epithet Aryan than any German chicken farmer ever had. Sacred Wells and Well-dressingThe Serpent-Dragon Jormangr, the encircler, coils about at the base ofYggdrasil, the Tree of Life of the Viking Kabala or Nine Worlds system. AtYggdrasil's roots there is a pool. In Ireland, Scotland and Wales this symbol isrepeated as the hazel tree by the well, in which lives the Salmon of Knowledge.Atop the branches of the hazel tree there sits an eagle who drops a blood rednut of wisdom into the well 13 times a year. There it is consumed by the Salmonof Knowledge. Not all Sacred or Fairy “Wells” were actually water sources. Archaeologistsworking at numerous sites around Britain have discovered that sites which areoften called “Fairy Wells” are, in fact, nowhere near the water table. Closerinvestigation revealed that these boreholes, as in the case of Mine Howe inOrkney, were actually Bronze Age ritual chambers on or adjacent to what thelocals would term a Fairy Hill. These chambers were entered via a spiral,flagged stairway descending a stone-lined cylindrical flue or chimney. In this connection, what does that tell us about, say, the Well of Nechtan, orSt. Anne's Well, situated next to the Robin Hood's hill labyrinth? In allprobability for ritual purposes we might conclude that a maiden priestessactually resided in the chamber beneath the hill. She was, we can conclude, therepresentative of “the Salmon of Knowledge” or Persephone and her pomegranatewine, or the queen of sovereignty and her dergflaith, the red beer of kingship.In this respect the connection between the womb and the underworld is clear, anda host of associations and reinforcements present themselves to the reader.These might lead us to consider what might be buried beneath the tower of St.Michael’s Church, which rests atop the Glastonbury Tor, under which is said tobe the palace of Alberich or Oberon, the Elven King. We might also wonderwhether such chambers were a feature of those sacred hills, which are associatedwith the ritual of king-making. Real wells and trees eventually became the focus of devoted rituals that we knownow as well-dressing. This was a misunderstanding of the idea that the tree andthe well were figurative and that their curative properties were obtained notfrom well water, but from something entirely different. Because these waterswere considered therapeutic and rejuvenating, the wells were blessed andvenerated. One supposes that in order to make the forgotten approximation closerto the reality of the symbol, the trees adjacent to these wells were decked incoloured patches of cloth. These symbolised the Chakras or Sephira of the Treeof Life of the female body, which the Druids were really symbolising in theiruse of the tree and the well glyph. In the case of the Gaelic form of Yggdrasil, the nut of the hazel represents thepineal discharge. As discussed, dropped by the eagle, representing the spirit orthe Sun God Llew (the Ajna Chakra or Kether Sephiroth), it descends through theTree of Life (like the lightning bolt of inspiration) and falls into the well orwomb. Here it is consumed by the Salmon of Knowledge. In the Irish story it isNechtan (meaning “pure one”), the God of “Waters”, who catches and eats thesalmon, a euphemism for cunnilingus. Repeating the entreaty of the grail storyhowever, it is only the “pure one” who may see or benefit from the “Grail”,which is here, as anywhere else, the female genitalia and the mysteriousessences they bestow. This story and its variants can be found across Europe in one suppressed orhidden form or another. Whilst the eagle represents the spirit, we are clear onthe nature and identity of the secretions represented by the nut. The spirit wassaid to be located in the pineal gland by Descartes, who was repeating anancient Gaelic belief. The salmon however represents the vulva, resting at the“bottom” of (e.g. beneath or below) the womb. Both in contemporary and in classical and historical colloquialism the fishrepresents the female vulva. This usage is universal. If eating fish is said tobe good for the brain, then eating Nechtan's salmon takes on a whole new meaningfor us. The fish crops up as a Christian symbol, that of Ichthys (meaning “fish”in Greek) which Christians believe means Iesus Christos Theos, or “Jesus ChristGod”. And on the subject of fish and fish women or Mermaids, we enter thelabyrinth. The LabyrinthThere was a Crooked Man,And he walked a Crooked Mile,He found a Crooked Sixpence,Against a Crooked Stile.He bought a Crooked Cat,Which caught a Crooked Mouse,And they all lived togetherIn a little Crooked House. We have discussed the nature and identity of the Dragon Queens and Kings asWitch Lords, Vampires, Elven Queens and Kings, Fairies and Seers. It is now time to place them into the context of their true “homeland” and takea closer look at their “mystical realm”. In German Hermetics, the Kabalistic Tree of Life, usually a hexagonal figure, isalso depicted as a series of 11 concentric circles. The outer circle representsMalkuth, whilst the inner circle represents Kether. Within this last circleshould be inserted another, representing “Ain Soph Aur”, the eternal wisdom orthe “Limitless Light”. This penultimate sphere—Kether—as Kabalists willreiterate, is also Malkuth on a “higher” or “purer” level. What this means simply is that once one has attained enlightenment, oneunderstands that the beginning of a journey is also its end and that Paradise,Eternity, Heaven, Elphame, Bliss or whatever, is and always was, right here onEarth. In Mithraic terms one slays the World Bull of finite perception andreleases the fertility of eternal life from its corpse. It is the slaying of theMinotaur in one's self and the attainment of the maiden Ariadne, or moreproperly Sophia, at the centre of the labyrinth. This is also the case with theBrea More labyrinth in Hampshire, where the centre of this turf “Troytown”figure is said to represent “paradise”. At the centre of all labyrinths therewaits the Dragon Maiden and her Holy Blood who are the physical manifestationsof, as well as a doorway to, the anima and the eternal. If one appreciates the Sephira of the Tree of Life as circles within circles,then the paths on the hexagonal Tree of Life figure, which join the Sephira toeach other, when laid out within the circular figure, become the winding pathsof the labyrinth. In the Chartres labyrinth: the “Jerusalem Mile”, whose patternis repeated across Britain and France, one can see the concept ofMalkuth-in-Kether-in-Malkuth laid out in the pathways. The labyrinth is agraphic representation of the mile long “Crooked Path” that leads to the truerealm of the Elves: Eternity. Later we will study the concept of the hexagonalKabalistic Tree of Life as both the realm and the genealogy of the early ElvenGods and a representation of the hive or group mind. Here the hexagonal shape ofthe Tree of Life of the Rabbis is reminiscent of the earlier “hive”configuration of the genealogical, Phoenician Kabala; a shape repeated in thedomed, beehive shaped hermitages of the early Irish monks. The Crooked Path to the Land of Elphame: the Kingdom of the ElvesThe Crooked Path from Malkuth to Kether also represents the lightning bolt ofinspiration that courses through each Sephira on its way from Kether, down theTree of Life to Malkuth, the Earth. In the Kabala the path is the lightningbolt, the origin of the Norse Sig rune, often depicted as the Serpent of Wisdom,spanning and joining Heaven or Kether to the Earth, or Malkuth. The Serpent orDragon eats its own tail and, in completing itself, becomes the Oroborous, theNix, Naga or Zero—the Fool of the Tarot—in which is contained everything andnothing. Its tail, which is heaven or eternity, contained and manifest in itsclutching mouth, is also made manifest upon the Earth and transcendence iscomplete. Also known as the Alchemists’ Ring—it is the ancient symbol of theAnunnaki whose name implies “When Heaven meets Earth”. In the story of Holger Dansk and Morgan le Fay, the Oroborous unites the figuresof the ancient Tree of Life as the Tree, the Dragon Maiden, the Ring, the Grailand the Labyrinth, in a symbol of Hierogamy so complete that it tolerates noidle interpretations. The word labyrinth has an etymology of which there are two interlinkedvariations derived from: i) labrys, a pre-Hellenic word said to mean “double headed axe”,ii) the Latin labia meaning “lips” or “folds”. The double-headed axe was sacredto Zeus; the Grecian Thor, whose hammer was a variant of the labrys. Thespinning hammer was thought to form the shape of the Swastika as it flew throughthe air, whipping up the whirlwind. This whirlwind and the spiral Swastika that symbolised it were the figurativeprogenitors of the stylised maze or labyrinth. Nevertheless the hammer, shapedlike two opposed crescent moons was, like the labrys, a female emblem. At thehighest level the labyrinth symbol works on several different but interconnectedstrata such as: the Folds of Time, the Spiral Cosmos, the Folds of Human SelfDeceit, the Journey of Life, the Brain and Spinal Column, the Womb and Vagina,the Tomb or Creachaire, the Vortex or Sumaire. We will be concentrating upon theVampiric symbolism in relation to samadhi or transcendence. As the Romans, formerly, and anciently the Scythian Trojans, continued to followHellenic customs, the word labrys would have been known to them. Consequentlythe construction of their Latin word labia would have had incorporated into itany of the original suggestions intimated by the preHellenic word labrys. This assertion is borne out by an inspection of the glyph representing thedouble-headed axe. It is constructed in an hourglass configuration by placingtwo equilateral triangles of equal dimension together point to point, with thepoints meeting on the vertical plane, equi-distant from the two horizontalplanes. From the central meeting point of the two triangles, a horizontal line extendsout, twice the length of the horizontal sides of the triangles into the plasterof the walls of the labyrinth at Knossos and it is this figure, the labrys,which authorities present as giving the Knossos labyrinth its name. With the handle removed and placed upright before the double triangle, we havethe figure 18. When the numbers are merged into a monogram, they form thecaduceus of Hermes, the “phallus” of Baphomet, the fennel stalked thyrsus ofBacchus-Dionysus, the fennel stalk in which Prometheus gave the gift of “fire”to man and the flying reed-stalk of the Witches (the original Witches’ broom). It is also the ribbon entwined maypole, the serpents Lilith and Samael entwinedaround the Tree of Life and the rise of kundalini up the helix encased spinalcord to the ajna Chakra of the brain, all of which the foregoing also represent. The Witches flying reed stalk suggests soaring consciousness in the same waythat the caduceus does, which has wings attached to what is thought to be thesolar disc. This is actually the Sephiroth corresponding to the brain. The firegiven to man by Prometheus might be thought by some to have been the fireserpent Kundalini, who features as a maiden in the service of the evil Klingsor,in the stories relating to Amfortas and the knights of the Holy Grail. Klingsor represents the perversion of the Vampire rite into an act of basesexual lust. He is the aspect of male human nature who, like the Minotaur,represents the danger of capitulation to sexual drives when the knight, likeTheseus, is presented with the true quasi-erotic nature of the Grail in the formof the virgin vulva. However, Kundalini promotes the production of noradrenaline and the sexualhormones which work in direct opposition to the Grail, and if the pilgrim allowshis baser nature to prevail, the “Grail” will destroy him by producing in himthe opposite hormonal response to that which engenders wisdom and spirituality. In the story of Amfortas, Kundalini realises her true function and dies tobecome a former physiological capacity in which she was ever active in theservice of “Klingsor”. Therefore she becomes passive and receptive to her other,deeper spiritual role, and capitulates to the service of the Grail, symbolisedby her expiry at the Fisher King's feet. This simply means that she, the spinal column, accepts her role as the conveyorof Grail chemicals from the pineal to the womb, instead of only sexual ones,from the genitals to the brain. With the expansion of knowledge in the scienceof endocrinology, it is possible now for the informed outsider to restore thesestories to their original meaning. So the fire of Prometheus is not the fire of Kundalini going up the spine to thebrain, but the fire of wisdom going down the spinal column to the womb to becomeStarfire, which is shed from thence and drunk in the “Rite of the Vampire”. The double triangle labrys design, identical with the one found in the labyrinthof Knossos but without the handle, was used up until medieval times to denotethe womb and vagina. One of the medieval sexual talismans incorporated into theClavicula Salomanis includes this axe-head glyph as a representation of thefemale principle, encircled by the Latin phrase “Exeat et Replete Terrum”, takenfrom Genesis. The talisman cited was used to attract female lovers, one mightspeculate for what purpose precisely. Certainly no purpose that would serve aVampire. The genital symbolism is therefore quite clear and whether the word Labyrinth isderived from either labrys or labus, it strongly indicates that the maze orlabyrinth was originally a graphic representation of the womb and vaginalchannel, at least on one level of relationship to any attendant symbolism. The labyrinth of Knossos is thought to be a later version of the templelabyrinth of Amenemhet (ca. 1818-1772 BC) built at Faiyum. This was a mortuarytemple complex consisting of some three thousand rooms and halls resting beneaththe shadows of the Pyramid of Hawara, a name which itself is reminiscent of theancient Sumerian Dragon Queen Hawah of Elda who was an ancestor of the builder. The Hawara labyrinth was adorned with carvings of the Dragon god Sobekh, towhich the labyrinth was principally dedicated. This is not surprising when onelearns that Hawara, formerly Arsinoe Ptolomais, was also named Crocodilopolis,the cultic centre of the veneration of this Egyptian Dragon god of sovereigntyand the protector of the royal caste. This was also the Sumaire of Sumeria andthe Scythians. The 22 kings of Egypt of the XIIth dynasty met there and it iswithin the precincts of this palatial labyrinth that Amenehemet's daughter,Sobekhnefru, held the Royal Dragon Court. Although vast in size, it was not unique, as many pyramids themselves hadlabyrinths built into their structure. We are reminded of the nature of pyramidsas sacred mountains, echoing Egypt's cultural origin in an earlier mountainousregion of Eurasia, and we will also remember the sacred hill of the Ogdoad andthe links between the pyramids, raths, sidhes, tells, tepes, kurgans andziggurats. The labyrinth, like the pyramid and its collaterals, is thought to be adevelopment of the idea of the mountain cave itself and examples in support ofsuch a theory are to be found in the intricate passages and designs ofPalaeolithic sanctuaries. As we know, each of the pyramids and their relatedstructures had funerary and living quarters and were representations of the“cave in the mountain”. From the kings’ or queens’ habit of living in these funerary buildings, weobtain the myth of the Vampire as one of the undead. Labyrinths have beendiscovered as far afield as Siberia (north-east Russia) and Wales. This suggestsstrongly, because of the locations, that the concept was of a Fairy origin. Insupport of this theory we find in Iceland various turf mazes and labyrinthinestone structures called Volsunghausen or “Wayland’s Homes”. Wayland or Alberich (Aubrey/Oberon) was also called Laurin and this name,meaning a Bay tree, has a double entendre when it is translated as “passage” inrelation to the maze cult. A spiral path can be trod to the top of GlastonburyTor, which is said to be the home of Oberon. Frequently these structures are associated with barrows. Atop one of theseoutside St. Anne's Well (a sacred site dedicated to Black Annis) inNottinghamshire there is a turf maze named “Robin Hood's Race”. It is virtuallyidentical with another which was sunk in a depression at the top of “TheFairies' Hill”, a barrow outside Asenby, Yorkshire. The custom of treading theAsenby maze in the evening and sitting in the centre to hear the Fairies singwas recorded as late as 1908. The design of these mazes, which are ofconsiderable antiquity, some say Bronze Age, have lately been called “ShepherdsRaces” (many with a distinct spiral pattern towards the centre of thestructure), and were copied by the Church during the medieval period. Thelabyrinths at Chartres and numerous other Churches in France, Germany, Spain andGreat Britain, are of an identical design with these far more ancient mazeswhich invariably were placed adjacent to or in the midst of originallyprehistoric sacred sites, often forming the centre of the Groves. The labyrinthof Chartes Cathedral, built by the Knights Templar in the 13th century, likemany ritual mazes, has no blind alleys or fake routes. At its centre there is asix petalled “Plantagenet” or wild rose, carved into which there seems to be anM figure reminiscent of the symbol of Virgo which is the M for “Our Lady”, theVirgin Mary Magdalene, to which the Ichthys or Salmon of Wisdom has beenappended, denoting the genital nature of the whole glyph itself. As the maze issituated in a cathedral dedicated to Notre Dame, it seems appropriate to thinkof it in these terms, as the womb of the virgin. The Rose Garden symbolism ofthe core of the labyrinth of Chartres is an echo of the Garden of Solomon andthe Rose of Sharon, meaning “Blood of the Virgin Princess”, and also of thelater forest labyrinth of Melusine, with its fountain, mentioned in medievalFrench literature. The Labyrinth of Solomon is in fact a medieval alchemical symbol doubtlesslydenoting the “scented fountain garden” of Sheba. In the French stories, Melusinelies in hiding at the centre of her maze garden, waiting to prey on victimsreturning from the pilgrimages to the Holy Land. She would draw them in anddrink their blood. Conversely she also lay at the centre of the maze, as theprize of the quester for the Grail. The centre of the maze incorporated a black cubic stone from which spurted thewaters of life, la fonteine de soif, and the blood of the virgin womb. AtChartres, the Rose in the centre of the maze can be seen bathed in the sanguinelight of the sun beaming through a strategically placed pane of red stainedglass, making the combined Grail symbolism apparent. Gematria is a system whereby attributive numbers are added together to give thelowest figure and thus reveal the essence or spirit innate in any particularbeings, words, higher numbers or objects, to which there have been traditionallyattached a numerological component. It was an integral part of Hermetics andKabala, which was used extensively as part of sacred geometry in many Templarbuildings. The Chartres Maze was also called the Jerusalem mile and was used as a symbolicsubstitute devotion in place of an actual pilgrimage to the Levant. The mile,though here only suggestive, is 1760 Roman yards which, when added togethergematrically gives 1+7+6+0 = 14. The multiple component of the mile is x 3, asthe mile is measured in yards or 3 feet spans. In order to calculate the numberof feet in a mile one multiplies 1760 by 3 which gives 5280 feet. In reality themaze path is far shorter, but the inference is implicit. It actually measures 150 yards, which was a Gaulish measurement of 1500 paces,called a leuca, leuga or leuva. This term is remarkably close to Lucca.Professor Margaret Murray states that this god was the one that the reputedroyal sacrifice, William Rufus, invoked in oaths. Lucca is related to Loki andLucifer, the bringer of light, also known as Mazda or Ormuzd. The cult of theMistletoe Bard and his journey to the Elysian labyrinth of Persephone is clearlydocumented in the author's notes on Cai ap Emrys and the Vere dying kings. If one multiplies the gematric sum of a mile (14) by the number of feet in ayard (3) one obtains 3 x 14 = 42, the diameter of the maze. In the medievalperiod three types of calendar were used: Solar, Lunar and Terrestrial. Thecalculations of both Solar and Lunar calendars are well known. Gematrically thesymbolic Chartres “mile”, if it actually were a mile in feet, added togetherwould give 5+2+8+0 = 15. This is the number of the path of the devil orBaphomet, the head of wisdom, the skull and crossbones, the androgynous god ofthe Templars (Mercury-Venus or Hermes-Aphrodite) whose combined male and femalegender celebrates Enthea: Hierogamy or divine union. However, it is 150 yards which added gematrically amounts to the same thing: 15.150 yards is 450 feet which adds to 9: N'H'sH, the tripartite triple goddessesof “The Love that is Death” and the Vampire Sumaire: the Spiral Serpent of theVortex. When the Catholic faithful walked the symbolic 5280 feet of theJerusalem mile, as the maze is called, kabalistically and gematrically they werefollowing the path of the Devil (15) and walking down the road to Damnation. The actual measurements used vary from modern scales but the componentmeasurements remain the same. The scale used was medieval and the diameter was42 old feet, each comprising of 11.5 inches per foot, which still relates toVenus and the cubic stone, Melusine, and so forth, without actually changing themeaning of the design. This measurement also seems to be a regularly occurringstandard for early turf mazes in Britain.The Chartres Maze was probably based itself on earlier patterns associated withMelusine and Sheba, which themselves were based on the Swastika, the pre-eminentglyph of the Vortex or Sumaire, the “sucker-in” and source of life and life'sblood. Associated with this is the concept of the maze as a dance pattern which,similar to the original sacrificial sword dance of the Danes and the Scots, wasan echo of the spiralling Witches' dance around the vortex and a celebratoryrite of the Wild Hunt. For some, entry into the maze would result in their life being drained away bythe virgin occupant, whose repast she would pass on to her kind, as she acted asthe fountain of thirst and fed them in turn from her holy blood. In a sensethen, where the Minotaur at Knossos is concerned (who is frequentlyinterchangeable with the Scythian Centaur in classical art), he is alsorepresentative of the Vampire king. Thus at the highest level, as a whirlpoolattracting and distributing life and life's blood, the Labyrinth was both tomband womb, life taker and life giver. In that order. On at least two occasions inEngland, labyrinths have been euphemistically referred to as “fish traps” orVeres (Norse: “Ver”). "},{"pageContent":"[images/00002.jpg]Chapter 7 The Jewel in the Crown The fact that it was a Druidic device can be ascertained by its 6th-centuryassociations with the bard Lwarch Hen. One will recall that Melusine was a“mermaid”, half fish (or rather Water Serpent) and half woman, and that Mer isthe Egyptian Hieroglyph which, shaped like a square spiral maze, denotes waterand irrigation. As an Elf Maiden she would have been the ritual quarry of the Wild Hunt and thus“a fish for the fish trap”, a blood offering for the Vere King. It appearstherefore that the maze is the Bower of the Virgin and indeed some mazes havebeen named just that: Maidenbowers. The symbol of Virgo, the M with a fishappended, denoting the virgin vulva and womb, is pertinent here. As the cubic stone is the Lia Fail, the emerald tablet, the vulva of Venus andthe jewel in the crown of Lucifer, then it relates also to the Sumerian Inanna,the Akkadian Ishtar. Like Melusine, she was said to consume her lovers, andHathor who, like Persephone, was the vendor of “deadly” Otherworldly “food”(which, like its counterpart, Fairy food, compelled one to remain in Elphame).Its sacred emblem was the Ankh from whence was derived the name of the Druidicdeath cult, the Ankhou or Anjou, of which Morgana, and Melusine (the Fountain ofThirst) of the Labyrinth, were high priestesses. The Ankh was also used by the Albigensian Cathars, thought by scholars to beeither the descendants of, or to have been influenced by, the PersianManicheans, the Arians and the Bogomils. This suggests a further reinforcementof the link between pre-Nicaean and thus gnostic-dualist, or originalChristianity and Druidism. The Maze is associated with the root word from whence we derive the adjective“to amaze”. This itself probably has associations with the name Mazda, theprinciple of light, suggesting that whatever was at the centre of a Mazerendered enlightenment and that ecstatic amazement, or wonder, accompanied it. As Ormuzd, it might even be associated with the Spiral Serpent of the vortex:the Sumaire. Some dictionaries have suggested in the past that maze was derivedfrom the Saxon word for a whirlpool, mase, and although scholars later insistedthat no such word existed, like it or not, the early maze was indeed afigurative vortex; a tornado or whirlpool. At the centre of the Knossos Maze there dwelt the Minotaur, the bull-man whodestroyed all who entered his environs. From previous notes we will recall thatthe bull, Jehovah, represented the unregenerate man and his world view. OnceMithras or Mazda slew the bull, from its veins poured forth all fertility. The bull's head also represented the female organs, one will recollect. Again asource of fertility on both levels. The Theseus story therefore is a typicalrendering of the central mystery of the dualistic cult of Mithras, which isrepeated in Sleeping Beauty, Beauty and the Beast, and the Tale of Holger Dansk.Theseus learns that 14 victims every nine years were sent to Knossos to appeasethe Minotaur. This has echoes in the popular medieval story of Melusine's Maze. The number 14 is, as we have seen, a strong component of the dimensions of theChartres Maze, which is 42 feet in diameter, being 3 x 14. The radius of themaze is 21 feet which is 3 x 7, representing the three fallow weeks of themenstrual cycle. The week of menstruus would be represented by the point at thecentre of the maze, which is, on certain days, illuminated red, as has beenrecorded in other works. The fourteen children, 7 virgins and 7 youths, sacrificed at Knossos, representtwo 1 week periods each. Of these there are, symbolically at least, 21 of eachin the terrestrial year, which, as 7+7+7 and 2+1 (3) connects the Labyrinthstory once more to the triple goddess and Persephone. The total days of theearth year of 42 weeks add up to 294 which, added together, gives the number 15again, the path of the devil which, added again, gives six and thus the hexagramof the Labrus, the womb and vagina of the virgin priestess. The Seal of the Temple is 777 and the number of Venus, as Netzach on theKabalistic Tree of Life, is also 7. The three components of the Seal representthe three aspects of Venus, Freja, Persephone or the Tantric Kali. In themselvesthey encode the three stages of the Vampire ritual. That is, a component of anentire hidden culture that, resting upon the universal archetypes of commonhumanity, forms, as Jung would argue, the distinct tribal or racial memory (mynote: of a unique and separate sub-species). This culture, its icons andrituals, is emotionally understandable and psychologically relevant andaccessible for them alone, as is the case for any given race. Diana and the Moon symbolise Virgin Blood. Venus-Aphrodite represents divineunion with the Maiden priestess (symbolised by Iduina-ArduinaDiana) and thetaking of her blood, whilst Hel-Hecate-Kore-Kali as the last aspect of the Earthand death, represents both the death of the mundane soul and the fertility ofthe super-consciousness that displaces it. Less familiar are the numerical values attributed to the earth or terrestrialcalendar, which operates using a 42 week system with extra days dispersedthroughout the weeks of the year. In this context, the maze therefore has a linkwith the horology of the earth and in particular to the myth of Persephone. Someauthorities claim that Persephone spent half the year in the Underworld, whilstothers state that her sojourn in Hell was for only a third of the year. Inancient times there were only three seasons in any event and it is likely thather Underworld semester was therefore for one third of an earth year. The earliest known calendar used to calculate the earth year was dug up at Clunyin France and dates back to the Celtic Bronze Age. It is therefore Druidic inorigin. Persephone is dealt with elsewhere in these notes, however it is worthnoting that she is said to emerge at the end of winter, thus representing thereturn of Spring and youthful fertility to the earth. She is therefore thefertile maiden. This is fertility of the blood in the rite of Enthea, not thefertility of bestial or vegetal congress and sexual increase. Her association with the labyrinth as a Swastika is confirmed by Knossian coinswhich bear her head on one side and the fylfot maze with an eightpointed star inthe centre on the obverse. An example may be viewed, with similar maze designvariations in the British Museum's coin collection. Like the Norse Freja and theAryan Kali, Persephone is a tripartite Goddess whose three aspects themselveshave three aspects, pointing to a distinctly Scythian origin and to the Celticbelief in the sanctity of the number Nine, gematrically associated in the Hebrewwith N'H'Sh; the Serpent or Dragon. Forbidden FruitsPersephone herself has three main aspects: Diana the Maiden, Persephone-Venus,and Kore as Hecate. The Norse equivalent, Freja, also has three correspondingaspects, Iduina-Freja of the Apples of eternal youth (Gaelic: Arduina-Diana ofthe Nine Fires and of the Blue Boar), GamlodFreja and Freja. In turn, Freja herself is one third of the team who made up the Witches ofMacbeth, these being Freja, Frigg and Hel. At death, the Norse believe, thechosen hero is welcomed at Valhalla by a Valkirie bearing the Drinking Horn (seebelow; Horn Gate) that contains the beautifully and suggestively named “Mead ofInspiration”, which in Gaelic is the Dergflaith of Sovereignty and in Greek, thewine of Persephone. The iconography is relevant here. Mead is the fermented juice of Apples (theGraffenberg discharge of the Royal Princess), flavoured by honey, whichsymbolises the polysaccharines and glucosides which are now thought to beproduced during the enzyme reaction (at a specific point in the menstrualcycle), that creates serotonin from melatonin. The “honeyed sweetness” of thefluid would indicate a high melatonin presence during the hours of the eveningand the night, which are ruled by Ishtar or Venus-Persephone, as the Goddess of“Love”. It is claimed that mead dates back 10,000 years. Therefore, it is probably theearliest manufactured beverage known to man. It is another of the archetypalrepresentations of the essence of the Goddess-Priestess, representing the flowof the priestess, sweetened by the nectar (ambrosia or “food of the Gods”)collected by bees who are the sacred animals of Binah, the mother ofUnderstanding. Nevertheless, if you cut an apple in half across the core, the seed chambersform the pentagram that appears on the brow of the Baphomet, symbolising thecubic stone. The seeds themselves contain cyanide in such a quantity as to make25 grams sufficient an amount to kill a man. The apple was chosen to representthe goddess but, as we can see and as tradition testifies, the goddess and herGrail maidens have a symbolic down side. Again we encounter the love that isdeath and the concept of death to one form of perception and the reawakening toanother. As Kali, Ishtar, Diana, Hecate and Hel, these Goddesses represent the deadlypotential of the sacred Elven female. The essence of the Grail maidens and theirchemically generated morphic energy can heal much, but there is a price to pay. One draught stimulates dormant centres in the Fairy brain that, in becomingsensitised to, and instinctively acknowledging these chemicals, it develops adependence on them and the subtle sweet energy they produce. Such is theintensity of the experience, as a pathological dynamic it is much likealcoholism. Because of this, although the maidens are indeed the Grail, they arealso called the fountain of thirst. Like La Belle Dame Sans Merci, the GrailMaiden, the Leanaan Sidhe, can leave her victim like Keats' palely wanderingknight who no longer sees the world in which he once belonged but sees, andconsequently inhabits, another world altogether. His has become a world of infinite wonders but, at her inevitable departure, ithas also become a world of unbearable longing, of intense hunger and thirst.Like “La Belle Dame” these beautiful living goddesses come as softly and asunawares as spirits, to open the door to the rose garden and initiate theirchosen prince. Having united with him in enthea and “removed” his soul, they inevitably departfrom these “chance” encounters as softly and as swiftly as at first theyarrived. Like bees they are put on the earth to pollinate the flower of Fairyconsciousness but invariably, like bees, they also suck dry the nectar of theFairy’s soul. Bees however, are the badge of the Merovingian descendants of King Solomon. HisSong, or at least the one attributed to him, is packed to the gunwales withVampiric references to the gathering of the nectar of maidens in an apiarinefashion later eulogised allegedly by Shakespeare, but no doubt by Edward deVere, who was a descendant of Solomon and a veritable son of the tradition. Bees live as equal entities in hives under the rule of one Sovereign who ischosen and created from their number by the administration of “Royal Jelly”(Dergflaith) by and from the body of the previous Queen. In this respect theclans of the Danaan, the Elven King Tribes of the Western Aryans, oncereplicated in their social structure the organisation of the hive. Furthermorethe hexagonal construction of the bees' incubation chamber, their place oforigin or birth, is repeated in the hexagonal shape of the Kabalistic Tree ofLife (the Planta Genista, the [family] tree of Origin). This was intended to beidentical in its shape and layout with the hexagonal web of relationships on thediagrammatical family tree of the Sumerian/Scythian Dragon GoddessQueens andGod-Kings, from whom the Fairy Danaan and the Merovingians are descended. Bees suck the nectar from the flowers in the garden and in like fashion theVampiric Fairy kings and queens drank the nectar of the lily and the rose fromtheir virgin goddesses, in the maze sanctuary of the sacred groves. The beesymbolises understanding, and in history so do the Fey, whose legendary powerand eternal wisdom, like that of their cousin Solomon, was phenomenal, such wasthe efficacy of the “Mead of Wisdom” distilled by the Elf maidens, the Valkiriesor Ladies of the Forest. With the canny dance of the Bee forming the figureeight, which in human terms represents infinity and is the glyph of Isis, wereturn once more to the subject of the triple goddess. In the triad of Diana-Persephone-Kore the individuals are represented by theMoon, the planet Venus and Earth respectively and reflect the qualitiesassociated with each. In Dragon terms, these aspects represent Potential (theBlood of the Moon), Union (the enthea of Baphomet as Persephone-Venus) andRelease (the winning of spiritual sovereignty and fertility) after reaching thecentre or Nix, the love that is death. This is symbolised by PersephoneKore, thefruitful Earth, which is both womb and tomb. Kore itself means virgin, and the image of Kore as Hel or Hecate as crones, isonly valid on an exoteric, popular mystical level which concerns itself withnature worship. However, the symbolism still hidden in nonrevivalist Witchcraft,as it has come down to us today, continually points to a high magical purposewith strong connections to the death and blood mystery cults of classical andpre-classical times. The symbolism is often interpreted as being concerned withvenal fertility because of the rustic allegorical images, which were employed tohide the esoteric information being conveyed. It has been forgotten that doctrines were split into three layers, eachcorresponding to the needs, interests and capacity for understanding of theintended audience or participants. In the mystery of Diana (Iduna orArduina)-Persephone-Kore related to Chartres, we have seen that we have anexample of the maze or labyrinth as both womb and tomb. In the myth ofPersephone and the pomegranate, the Dianic Mistletoe Bard of Arduina must enterHel or the Underworld to draw the wine of the fruit of life from her, which inthe Gaelic is called dergflaith, the red beer of the queen of sovereignty. Alsoreminiscent of this journey to the underworld is the fate of the potential loverof the mermaid who is destined to be drawn into her realm and certain death. Itmust be remembered that this is only death of the ego. According to trial transcripts the Templars kept a preserved head in a silverreliquary carved with the figure of Virgo , the Virgin-and-Icthys or Vulvafish.This head, it is said, they called the Baphomet, or head (source) of wisdom, orFather Mitras. The Baphomet or Bafomet of the Templars, according to Fr. EliphasLevi, was an androgyne figure which, with a bit of consonant wander no doubt,incorporated the Mithraic element suggested in Vatr Mitr, which has a distinctAryan ring to it. Virgo relates to Iduna and Arduina, Diana or Artemis thevirgin huntress, as well as Mary and Persephone. Related to Persephone isOrpheus or Bacchus-Orpheus in the cult of the Elysian Plain which, like the roseat the centre of the Chartres maze, lies at the centre of the Otherworld.Bacchus was also called Liber, which in Latin means a) liberty or release, b)Tree, c) Wine, d) a book, wisdom or secret knowledge, the Hidden Torah. Orpheus in the UnderworldBacchus-Orpheus, it will be remembered, was crucified, hanged on a tree likeOdin and Christ. With Dionysus, he was a god of the blood and death cults of theMediterranean region. This correlates with the Elysian mysteries, introduced tothe inhabitants of Greece and Crete by the Scythian Danaan of Troy, who hadsettled in Carthage and Egypt following the fall of their city. The ElysianPlain corresponds to the Irish Tir Na n'Og, the Land or Tree of Youth, whichitself has associations with the Ankh. In recounting the Elysian story of Aeneas and the Trojan rout, Virgil explainsthat Aeneas travelled to Italy to seek out the Sibyl or Shamanka of Cumae, togain knowledge of how to enter the underworld and obtain an audience with hisdeceased father. In order to enter the door of Dis and descend to Averna (cf.Avalon), the shamaness explains, he must first bury a friend and then pluck theGolden Bough. However, she warned him that although many may enter, few exceptthe children of the gods (my note; The Elven race) may leave again (this denotesa ritual involving Fairy food). On leaving the Shamanka's cave, theTrojan-Scythian lord buries a fallen comrade and plucks the Mistletoe. As in thetale of Gilgamesh, the Shamanka accompanies him on the journey and both descendinto Hades where they meet Orpheus on the Elysian Plain. They accomplish thetask they set out to do, after which Aeneas (being the son of Assaracus byAphrodite and the descendant of Electra the daughter of Atlas the Titan, son ofIapetus or Japhet, the Lord and father of the Elven race), was permitted toleave. Next to the doorway to Hades, Virgil locates a representation of the labyrinth,as a map of the underworld with, as we discover as the story unfolds, Elysium:Avalon, at its heart. As a teaching, the story of the underworld questincorporating the mistletoe can be found in the epic of Gilgamesh, giving aBabylonian and, no doubt, an early Sumerian, middle eastern origin for thelabyrinth concept. This, as the spiral vortex, is related to the decorativemotifs employed by the Ubaid culture of Scythia and Carpathia, from whence theroyal Sumerian culture itself originated. In support of such a view it is pertinent that in Scandinavia, labyrinths weresometimes referred to as “Babylons”. In the Roman Empire, the figure of thelabyrinth formed into jewelery was worn exclusively by the emperors, because itwas considered to be solely a royal insignia. At such a time the explicitinference would have been to directly connect the labyrinth concept to that ofKingship and thus, in classical memory, to the ancient Dragon cult of Sumerianpriest kings. In the story of Theseus and the Minotaur, by the time Theseus is said to haveturned up, the tribute to the Minotaur in youths' and virgins’ blood had beenpaid twice in 18 years. Gematrically this gives a total of 28 victims or onelunar cycle of 28 days. The youths' blood represented the fallow part of thecycle. The 18 year period represented Isis and Osiris, Keshalyi and Locolico, or Nergaland Nin-Kursag. Osiris was the Blue-Faced God of the dead who was thecounterpart of the Aryan, blue-faced Shiva-Vishnu, the blue boar. Osiris'brother Set first tried incarcerating him and throwing him in the Nile, but Isisand her sister Nephthys found him and revived him sufficiently to father Horusfrom Isis. Secondly, (Set was not a quitter), Osiris was ripped to bits by his fratricidalbrother and his members were scattered. Again, Isis, and Set's wife Nephthys,went around picking up the bits but couldn't find his penis. This is the symbolof his creative force or sovereignty and another symbol for the spinal column,as emphasised by the serpent-entwined “phallus” of the Baphomet, which is toppedoff by an orb, representing the brain. In consequence of this, Osiris is acandidate for identification as the first Fisher King, crippled “in the thigh”,as the proprietous euphemism puts it. Osiris's “organ” is represented by thefigure one or I. Isis' figure is infinity or the number 8, which was often drawn as the doubleaxe-head figure found in Knossos or Cnossos, a name derived itself from theGreek root word gno, which also renders gnome, gnomen (judgement) and gnosis orwisdom, from whence derives (self) kno-wledge. The phallus representation in exoteric Tantra suggests a symbolic link betweenthe rush of ejaculation and the release of energy when the kundalini is aroused.This kundalini serpent is said to course up the spine from the base Chakra, likesemen rushing up the urethra, inundating the brain in a phenomenon described asa psychic orgasm. An apt analogy. The phallus symbol here refers to the spinal column that carries the neuronalpathways of the brain. Consequently it carries its vital essences, via the thirdventricle and the nerve helix, it leads to the Graffenberg gland, the womb, theurethra and the bowel where certain corresponding essences are manufactured andfind their way back up to the brain, much in the same manner as the kundalini. The kundalini differs, however; in that it is the process whereby a rush ofaggressive, sexual, electro chemical signals are forced up the brain stem to thebase of the corticospinal tract. It is suggested that the kundalini effect issimilar to that of stimulatory drugs like MDMA and amphetamine, and that thesignals incite the brain stem to release substances including dopamine,noradrenaline and acetylcholine in a violent cascade reaction which arouses thesophisticated sensory centres of the higher brain. These are not the chemicalsassociated with transcendence but with processes that reinforce the desire forand attachment to material gratification, the very obstacles that stand betweenthe individual and “spiritual” release. Despite constant references in the ancient teachings to the conflict between thedifferent forms of body chemistry, it is often thought by some that sexualintercourse is the primrose path to the Kingdom of Heaven. It can lead so far,inasmuch as it introduces the beginner to altered states of perception. That isundeniable. However, biologically, one endocrinal process inevitably dominatesthe other, and it is the subtler process that causes transcendence. It is notthe one driven by the desire to achieve more intense, longer orgasms. It’s fun,but it’s not the real thing. Consequently ancient Aryan, Draconian “sex magic”,unlike the type envisioned by a few modern authors and the western gurus ofright hand path Tantra and the eastern mysteries, has little to do withpenetrative sexual intercourse. Therefore Osiris' One or I represented not simply the phallus, but both thetongue and the spinal column, and the eight thus represented Isis' womb andvagina. Under the principle that a king isn't a king without a queen, Isis andOsiris are shown together as the figure 18, or 666, the mark of the beast, orthe Knossos Axe Head: 8, where the I is horizontal. Theseus, like Orpheus, must travel through a subterranean realm to find his loveand, like the Mistletoe Bard, at the centre of Hades he will win the Chalice ofPersephone's pomegranate wine. Theseus decides to tackle the Minotaur and armedwith a sword given him by Ariadne he enters the labyrinth with a golden threadtied about his waist. This sword is firstly the straight-edged weapon of focusand purity of intent. The symbol is working on two different levels at the sametime here. The golden thread relates to the Golden Fleece and also the Grail, itis the rivulet of womb blood on the biochemical level, whilst on thepsychological level it represents the path of logic and truth. As the golden thread is given to Theseus by Ariadne, it is emphatically a femalesymbol. A question that immediately springs to mind is whether the Theseusversion of the story was at variance with others, or with the primeval Grailtheme itself, by suggesting that the golden thread was not already laid out onthe path. In Rapunzel the golden thread is her hair and the maze is substitutedby an equally daunting but related structure. A tower. Nine Pieces of GoldSymbolically, Ariadne is at the centre of the maze, just as Rapunzel is at thetop of the tower and, as Rapunzel lets down her golden hair to assist the knightin getting to her, Ariadne in another sense, assists Theseus. A tablet at Knossus describes Ariadne as the “lady of the labyrinthe” to whommoney offerings were made. In developing this theme, Michael Grant (Myths of theGreeks and Romans) says that Ariadne was a goddess of the underworld. Thisrelates her to both Persephone and Melusine and, strangely enough, to St.Nicholas of Dumnonia or Cornwall. He, as a Mistletoe Bard and traveller to theunderworld, a horned Merlin and an Odinic priest, is said to have offered threegold coins each to three poor virgin sisters to prevent them from becomingprostitutes. There appear to be three girls who have the same relation to Santa Claus asthere is to Theseus. They also appear to symbolise the tripartiteDianaPersephone-Kore or her priestesses. The nine Byzantine, imperial gold coinsthat the Druid Nicholas or Nicassius gave to the holy virgins became the nineheraldic “bezants on a field sable” which variably were the arms of his, theEmrys family, and which eventually became the arms of the duchy of Cornwall. The apocryphal story of St. Nicholas/Nicassius offering money to the impecuniousvirgins probably relates to St. Nicholas' family as the DruidicPriestlyadministrators and Keepers of the Sacred Grove, its holy temple and its virginpriestesses. Like Magdalene, they came to be thought of, utterly erroneously, asprostitutes. Cassius was the name of one of the Roman rebels but has links alsowith, and was possibly a re-expanded diminutive or affectionate form of the nameCaspar, which is of Persian origin and is said to mean treasurer. This meaningwas probably derivative and like Nicholas, Caspar, probably a temple official,was the Syrian Magus or Druid who was said to have presented gold to the childJesus. The link between St. Nicholas of Dumnonia and the bezants would suggesttherefore that this is the more likely secondary meaning of his name which isitself ultimately related to Nisse or the Nix. In a way it can be said that the golden thread in Theseus is a rivulet or rtu ofAriadne's essence, a sutra that leads Theseus to the centre of the mystery andthe Grail. One might suggest that symbolically the golden thread was spun byAriadne from the wool of the Golden Fleece. This artifact is a classic variationof the Grail symbol which, guarded by a Dragon in the heart of Greater Scythianear to where Prometheus was chained, had the same healing properties attributedto the Holy Grail and the blood of the Elven goddesses. In relation to the theme of the Grail as a panacea and physick, is the WhiteCross of St. John or the gnostic Iao (Jao), related to the sephiroth ofTiphareth and closely linked with Isis and Persephone. The question must be asked, “How on earth is a thread tied about Theseus's waistgoing to help him find the Minotaur?” Quite simply it isn't, and yet the storydoesn't say he spent six weeks wandering around in circles getting tangled up inwool before he found the monster. If the Labyrinth were a Maze, the thread wouldbe fine for helping him find his way out, but equally difficult without a goldenthread to guide him, would be the task of finding his way to the centre in thefirst place. However, the structure at Knossos is described as a Labyrinth andlabyrinths—unlike Mazes—are single paths which inevitably lead to their goalswith no blind alleys or fake turns. This would render Theseus' need for anactual golden thread redundant, whilst on the psychological level the labyrinthwould cease to exist once the Minotaur had been slain, thereby rendering thethread pointless anyway. G.R. Levy explains that the thread (Sanskrit: sutra as in Kama Sutra), or rope,or “clue”, and the winding path appear as components of European tales of entryinto an actual or subjective spiral maze. Many of them were found in medievalChurchyards or grave/grove-yards, signifying that the ancient groves were placesto meet with the dead. Furthermore the word dru (as in Druid) in Sanskrit means“run”, as in run the race or “dance the maze”. The Llans were special geographical locations where the groves were built. Thesewere on the intersection between Dragon Lines (not ley lines) where a) the powerwas thought to be strongest and b) the site occupied a kind of in-between placewhich, like crossroads, were neither one direction or another and thus were saidto be in-between the worlds. As such they were doors to Elphame and later,crossroads (invariably with their gallows poles) and graveyards became themeeting places for Witches. Gallows were often placed at cross-roads, doorwaysto the Otherworld, in order to facilitate the criminal's speedy journey to Hellor Elphame—life after death. His or her ghost may then be encouraged to leavethe mortal realm immediately, thus discouraging him or her in death from furthertroubling the living, as they had done in life. Grant continues by saying that the maze relates to the life after death andgives initiation. The author emphasises that life after death is more properlylife before death or transcendence, being the life of superconsciousnessfollowing the death-in-life of mundane perception. Such a teaching accords with the message of Jesus and most other mystics. Grantrelates the thread to the spindle of Sleeping Beauty, making her a Fate or Mori,a goddess figure like the golden-haired Scythian princess Ariadne. In SleepingBeauty's story the thread is in the Castle which, surrounded by a thicketrepresenting the labyrinth, is the centre of the maze itself and thus the rosegarden and the Elysium. Sleeping Beauty occupies a tower in the castle in the undergrowth, or a CaerGlas (Verrieres) in the Forez, if you like, in similar fashion to Rapunzelelsewhere mentioned herein, who lets down her golden hair to admit the knight toher tower chamber. In the course of time, stories change and become corrupted byvarious admissions and omissions. This is the process whereby history becomesmyth and legend. It can be suggested therefore that Theseus' story likewise appears to haveundergone changes and suffered the ravages of time. To facilitate a meaningfulinterpretation of these stories, it is necessary for the student to compare themtogether by genre and settle for a common sequence of events and a commonobjective. For them to make any sense at all, they must relate to human physiology andpsychology and be grounded in empiricism. If the stories are subjected to overmystification by those who are unaware of their inner workings or of theavailable esoteric knowledge or the intention of the stories' creators,confusion sets in. On the Grail or biochemical level, Theseus must follow the rivulet to attain anddrink from its source, having battled with his own common lust in such asituation. If he does he wins Ariadne as the Virgin Grail, intact andappropriately related to him. If he does not and the Minotaur (Arthur'sKlingsor) within him prevails at the source, then Theseus will defile thatsource for base gratification and the Minotaur, his own sexual lust for Ariadne,will consume him. Theseus is a wily lad however and unlike Arthur's Druidic saw, which is anadaptaion of the story of Theseus and Ariadne, his is a story of success.Theseus attains the source of the golden-red fluid, the heart of the labyrinth,and with Galahad-like purity of heart (focus and insight) he sees the Grail inthe form of the Minotaur, the bull instead of just Ariadne's sex organs. Thisact itself is enough to slay his Minotaur and he exits the labyrinth to unitewith Ariadne, the virgin source of sovereignty. However, now he must enter oncemore and face another Minotaur on a different level of being. In the story, bothMinotaurs are one and the same and are slain at the same time, but I amanalysing the story level by level and it is in this sense that Theseus repeatsthe two-fold exercise. Having attained and consumed Ariadne's blood, she has become his Sheba, hisRhiannon, his Guinevere and his Viviane. Armed with the sword of her sovereignty(creative energy, [non-sexual] libido), he now enters once more to trace hispath through the avenues and back alleys of human self deceit and confront thevery power source, the very foundation of his own delusion. This he does and in slaying his Minotaur once more, he wins Ariadne, theSleeping Beauty, his Anima, and her sword of sovereignty is the straightedgedblade of his purity of mind, his focus, clarity of vision and singularity ofpurpose. Having reached Hierogamy or Enthea and individuation or personal sovereignty,Theseus left Ariadne to Dionysus, the bull-headed child of Zeus, the GreatWorld-Bull of delusion. In the French versions of Arthur's tale, Guineveredecamped from Camelot with Lancelot. In all these tales, the “marriages” werenot sexual in the sense that we would understand and they weren't built to last. Because narrators don't know the real reason for these alliances, a socialtendency towards post-Victorian morality interprets the separation of thecouples as betrayal and marital breakdown. In reality, the contract had come toan end with the change in blood chemistry and the females were then ready toleave and pursue other interests. Axe LordsThe Minotaur has been said to be a version of the Phoenician, bull-headed God,Baal Moloch, the son of Enlil. This might be partially right in a ritual contextwhere, it is thought, sacrifices were made to the Phoenician King enacting theritual role of the god by wearing a bull's head as a mask. It is suggested that the Minotaur was Minos himself or some other Cretan king inmasquerade, fulfilling some ritual role. Said to represent the virile principle,the bull symbol appears on other Aryan artifacts as far away as Harappa in theIndus in 3000 BC. If the virile principle is seen in context as the workings of various hormonesin the human physiology, it will be understood that those hormones are thereforealso the chemicals responsible for many human delusions and anxieties. Initiallythey suppress the production of melatonin and serotonin which themselves play aprofound part in the attaining of transcendent states of consciousness. Thisbrings us back to the symbol of the human mind as the World Bull of Deceit, andto Mithras as Theseus and so on. Theseus was the son of Neptune, king of the waters, an Otherworld symbol, whilstAriadne was the daughter of Minos, king of the dead, another Otherworldcharacter. As a king of the dead or “Dead King”, Minos was ritually associatedwith the Repha'im. The axe-head carving in his labyrinth suggests that hispeople had some association with the Scythian Axe Lords of Idumea and Mittani,from whence came the cult of the Kings of the Dead (Osiris or Orion), theRephaim or Angels. The chronology is flawed in the original tales and the characters are mostlikely to have been the lineal descendants of the major deific personages, butremoved by relationship to a further degree than the stories allow. Consequently, Minos was the son of Zeus (Enlil), or of Zeus' royalpriestlyofficiate or descendant, and Europa, who was the daughter of Phoenix, whom weassume was the historical Phineas Farsidhe, the Scythian King of Phoenicia.Minos' brother was called Rhadamanthus, the red-haired, according to MichaelGrant, so we can safely say that this genetic strain was present also in Minosand Ariadne, both of whom therefore were Scythian. Thus we have a strongScythian component in the Labyrinth concept, both in Egypt and Crete. Ariadnewas a form therefore of Lilith, who was the daughter of Nergal, whose namesuggests Naga'el and the Naga or serpent gods of the deeps who, as the Avatarsor Shining Ones—the Anunnagi—form part of the Aryan Hindu pantheon. The Axe Lord epithet has more to do with the Grail than with the axe as the“tree” or “man hewer” (in Hebrew—Nefilim), as the Grail is often drawn in theform of a Labrus or upended, double-headed axe. There are similarities betweenTheseus and Ariadne and Samael and Lilith. Where Theseus is the son of the kingof the sea, Samael is the Lord of the Waters. Ariadne is the daughter of the King of the Dead and so is Lilith. Lilitheventually became the consort of Enlil-Jehovah and the substitute matronit orLady Sabbath. She was likened to Sophia, the Shekinah and the Holy Spirit orWisdom. Likewise Ariadne left Theseus for Dionysus, the son of Zeus. Ariadne wastherefore also a source of divine wisdom. In a sense, Dionysus' attainment of Ariadne from Theseus and EnlilJehovah'sAttainment of Lilith from Samael is symbolic of the way in which divine wisdom(Lilith) was purloined by the usurper. This has repeated itself in the claimthat Rome has made over Mary and the Chartres Maze. The Chartres Maze is circular and has a central path leading from the outercircumference to the rose in the middle. On either side of this channel are theturns of the inner paths arranged to look like the ridges of the walls of thevagina, as depicted on the Mycenaean Grail chalice. Again Rome has sequesteredthis anciently inspired symbol and profaned it by what they considersublimation. Today the faithful flock to Chartres from all over the world to walk a Mazeinspired by vampirism and laid down in stone by “Satanists”. By doing this theythink they will get closer to God by an “Act of Faith”, repeating the endlesstheme that the maze itself wished to warn man against. That is that theLabyrinth can represent the dominion of empty form over substance and that man'smind is a vast cavern of paths that fold back on themselves endlessly. Mankindattempts to hide from man himself the central mystery of his own unjustifiedmisery and terror, that at the centre of his being, cloaked in delusion andfear, lies nothing. The folding paths of the maze are the paths of deceit and dogma, of ritual andhabit that must, like the Gordian Knot, be rent asunder if man is ever toglimpse what is real. The habit of walking the Chartres maze merely reinforcesthe very stupidity that prevents man from ever actually reaching the maze'strue, hidden centre. That man can reach peace and “salvation” by mindlessly walking round in acircle, just because a priest says he can, is yet another fold of self deceit inthe maze itself. Symbolically the Chartres maze is so configured as to inviteyou to ignore all the folds of the pathways and walk straight up the vaginalchannel and into the centre of the symbol. Nevertheless it is characteristic ofhomo religiosus that nobody ever does. The Chartres maze was not created for Roman Christian ritual but for ameditation alien to its tenets and foreign to its culture. Like much that is ofvalue, much that has meaning and the potential to transform consciousness, theChurch has wiped away the dynamic and replaced it with safe, empty party gamesthat ensure that none break free from the grip of tyranny maintained throughmindless conformity and mimicry. Such a sad parody is endemic in all religionand religious thought, not just in Christianity. A tradition which repeats the theme of the Sacred Virgin at the centre of thelabyrinth is discovered in rural British custom where the Vampire symbolism ofthe original iconography became reduced to rituals for fertility and games ofsexual licence. On village common land throughout much of Merrie England it was the custom tolay out a maze and on Sunday afternoons and at other leisure times, the maidensof the parish would gather at the maze and one would elect to stand at itscentre. The local village lads would then race each other round the maze to seewho could win the virgin first. The winner was awarded a barrel of beer, and thevirgin, of course. This custom also appeared in Finland and Iceland and, as elsewhere, echoes theoriginal pursuit of the Wild Hunt. The beer was a folksy, rustic reminder of thewine of Persephone in a ritual involving peasants trying to imitate themysteries of their ancient superiors, the meanings of which they had absolutelyno idea. Those who adhere to Christianity or modern Witchcraft and occultismtoday—all of which are the low versions of the quest for the Grail andEnthea—where such mindless dogma or ritual and bestial copulation have no place,are exactly the same. In many mazes, thought to be the “Core” of a “Llan” (cf. Avalon or AvaLlan) orsacred site, there were once erected pillars upon which were situated theeffigies of doves. These sites were the apple groves where the Mistletoe Bardsgathered with the sacred virgins to conduct the secret blood rites of Arduinaand sing into being both the Gods and the noble characters of the Kings. Llanalso appears as lawn, originally meaning a clearing in a wood. Lunn means asacred grove/enclosure/lawn/clan. Taken as a whole concept, the Llan was asacred sacrificial grove. "},{"pageContent":"[images/00072.jpg]Chapter 8 The Cors The sacred virgins were the cors (cf Kore or Persephone of the Pomegranate, seeprevious notes) who sang in choirs and who, like Ariadne at Knossos, performedthe sacred spiral dance of the “choros” which, in ancient times, were also thechorus of narrators of religious ritual, ballad and tragedy. This chorus, in later Rome comprising of only the cream of noble youth andmaidenhood, danced the maze around a central core or “Cor”. In effect this wasthe eye of the storm or whirlwind, symbolised by a column or pillar, upon whichroosted the Dove of the spirit, the Magdal, which represented the corpuscallosum, and the wings of the grey matter of the cerebral hemispheres of thehuman brain. As late as 1660 a turf maze in Hilton, Huntingdonshire sported justsuch an obelisk capped with a sphere, placed there by its builder, a WilliamSparrow. Similar to Chartres, but in a more direct fashion still, the path to the centreof the maze is straightforward. At Saffron Walden, prior to the turn of the lastcentury, the centre of its turf maze was occupied by an Ash tree or Aes tree(Na'Nuine), symbolic of the Goddess of sovereignty and reminiscent of the FairyAes Dan, the Danish Aesir or first gods, the Asher of the Egyptians (Isis andOsiris) and the Asuras or Shining Ones of the Scythian Aryans. Merlin Emrys wasmarried to Ninian or Na'Nuine, replicating the union between Odin and Yggdrasil. Also pertinent to the maze, as the genitalia of the Cor or virgin (OED), andvariously therefore the Triangle of Daleth in which is set the All Seeing Eye ofGod, is the Cor, as the pupil of the eye. The graveyards, in which are locatedthe barrows or bergs of the high Kings of the Dan at Uppsala, are triangular. Further linguistic relationships include Cor: a Horn, as in Hearne or Cernunnos.This is related to Keras; the Horn of the Horn Gate of true visions which is oneof the portals of the Underworld. Keras is related to the verb Krainousi,meaning “to attain fulfillment”. Possibly fanciful, though tantalising, is theidea that the “Horn Gate of True Visions” was originally the arch of the openlegs of the Meremaid, attired in her Scythian, horn-plated ritual armour. However, Michael Grant suggests, in his commentary on the Aeneid, that thisrelates to cornu, the eye with its horny tissue, the cornea, whilst the othergate, the Ivory Gate of Falsehood, corresponds to the teeth and the mouth. Heelaborates that what is seen first-hand is truer than that which is related inspeech; a pertinent observation well fitting the magical idea that Gnosis isgreater than belief and initiation is more powerful than faith. Nevertheless, inrelation to the Horn Gate, it is still poetically and charmingly supportive ofCor, as the Eye in the Triangle. In elaborating on the concept of Cor as cornu and in further pursuing the Hornand Ivory symbolism, we should look at the twin pillars of the temple: Boaz andJoachim. One is black and the other is white, corresponding to the Horn andIvory Gates of Hades in Virgil's Aeneid. Bull's horn is often black in colourwhilst Ivory is obviously white. The major arcana of the Waite Tarot, with its wealth of organo-alchemical,Solomonic symbolism, could well be termed the Tarot of the Vampire or the “a lacarte menu” of the Epicurean. The second card, the High Priestess portraying thevirgin Isis, is seated before a veil decorated with Persephone's pomegranates,which is suspended between the two pillars. Partly concealed beneath her bluerobe she holds a scroll on her lap bearing the legend Torah, or Law. Onerecollects the Welsh story of the virgin's lap and its association with thefemale organs in the story of King Math. Here it is indicated that the law resides within her womb and that she and itare situated between the pillars and thus represent and occupy the point of Zenbalance or stillness derived from divine union. This is symbolised in BritishWitch tradition by the seesaw and the candle. Kabalistically speaking she sitsat the Core of the Llan, the inner sanctuary of the temple in the labyrinth,before the invisible middle pillar of the Tree of Life. It is in this position,in ceremonial magic, that initiates position themselves psychically inanticipation of a final communion with their Holy Guardian Angel. This for themanyway, is the Ende-Werk of the Hermetic process, as envisioned by modernoccultists. On her head the High Priestess wears a crown comprising of the discof the Ajna Chakra or Sephiroth of Kether positioned between the draconian hornsof divinity. On her breast she wears the Johannite white cross of Iao or Thymusthe Healer (see endocrinology section), and at her feet rests the crescent ofthe new moon. The classical symbolic link between the feet and the genitaliaderives from the empirically obvious, explained by modern neurological anatomylinked to recent studies of the compensatory adjustments made by amputees whodevelop ghost limbs. Neuro-surgeons locate the nerve terminals for the feet immediately adjacent tothe nerve terminals for the genitals. This delightful discovery also goes someway in explaining how the body's meridian lines work. Again, in this particularinstance the High Priestess Icon demonstrates that the middle pillar, thePerrone of the Tree of Life, represents the spinal cord of the Swan Princess andthat she and her sephira, the Apples of Iduina, are the Daleth or doorway to theunderworld. Cor as Kore or corn, as in John Barleycorn and the Barley Mow, is associatedwith the circular field, a variant or adjunct of the sacred Llan grove, in whichthe sacred grain was grown for the cakes and ale served at preChristianceremonial journeys to the Other/Underworld. Human sacrifices were stronglyassociated with the Barley Mow and the blood was sprinkled as a libation acrossthe field. Further to this, the word Hospital, or Ysbyty in Welsh, is associated primarilyand anciently with hospitality. The Ysbytys were Druidic houses, rather likeTemplar Preceptories or small monasteries or Bangors where local people ortravellers could go to refresh and heal themselves. The sign outside such anestablishment was usually a Druidic Blue Boar and it was a part of Brehon Lawthat any given region should have a certain number of these establishments towhich were attached the Barley Mow adjacent to the Sacred Grove nearby. The ritual function of the Barley Mow and the public rites in the Grove can beviewed as an intentionally pagan (pagani—a Roman social numerical unitcorresponding to a Sept) or popular derivation of the higher rites of Enthea.They were probably devised as devotional ceremonies for the Celtic peasantry ofthe rural septs, or pagani, by the Scythian Druids whose Bards, one recollects,also sang into being gods for them to worship. From this we discover the origins of the rustic games which parodied the questfor the grail in the common mazes of Merrie England. Lastly, Cor as CorvusCorvidae (see OED), the Raven or Morgana whose position in the story of HolgerDansk, was under a tree at the centre of a circular garden protected by aserpent or Dragon. (On one level the serpent also represents the Nidhe Hogga,the spiral serpent of the Cosmos.) As such, Morgana is, like Ariadne, Melusine and Sleeping Beauty, the Virgin atthe centre of the labyrinth. The Corvus of Morgana was interchangeable with theDove in Hebrew Kabala, as a bird of divination (Cor: the eye: “to see”) and theunderworld or Qlipphoth. The Raven was originally sacred to Lilith. Etymologyderived from OED. (The serpent-necked Serpilion Dove is interchangeable with theSwan and is related to the Solar Caduceus). In parody of the sacred ritual dance, in later ages, maidens and youths dancedthe Maypole and Morris Men danced the ring around the Maze at whose centre theMaypole was often erected. The idea that the Maypole was a phallic symbol isonly true on one level. At its highest level the maypole was the Tree of Life and thus the SpinalColumn, at the head of which rests the Dove of the Brain. The true significanceof the Maypole dance can be observed by watching what happens as the girls andboys (see sacrifice to the Minotaur above) weave the web of coloured ribbonsaround the pole. With each step the maidens and youths get closer to the poleitself as if drawn into the Maze. The interlaced pattern of the woven ribbonsrepresents the web of Elphane or Arachne, the web of the Fates or Fairies(Mori-gans), in one sense drawing them closer to the maze's centre and theirdoom. As they dance closer, the woven ribbons around the pole itself tighten upand begin to symbolise the helix pattern of the nerve channels that encase thespinal chord, on their way down to the base of the spine and ultimately thewomb, the central point of the labyrinth. The Tree of LifeThis spinal column or Core Pole, the Ankh shaped Bethel Stone, is not simply orsolely the penis of some god of mundane fertility, but the main trunk of theTree of Life that is Diana. It is the backbone of the Virgin Goddess, huntressand protector, and any virgin royal priestess, or Cor, who represents her. On a smaller scale, the Maypole is the Thyrsus of Dionysus, topped with itspinecone. In Scandinavia the maypole relates to the Axis Mundi, the lynch pinwhich was said to hold the sun in place and whose foundation lay buried beneaththe world. The Axis Mundi is The World Ash or Aes, and the Trunk of the Ash, the Maypole,represents the spine of the Goddess or priestess. Thus the sun represents theAjna Chakra, the halo of Christianity, whilst the Earth represents the virginwomb. This symbolism is repeated in the Ankh cross, dealt with in a furtheressay. The maze or spiral dance around the Maypole is a development from the earlierchorus around the stones and the later Witches’ spiral and ring dance. Theorigins of this are to be found in the dance around the Core or Perron stone atthe centre of the Labyrinth within the ancient Grove. Sometimes these Perronstones had pinecones carved at the top, as a variant of the Dove but which areidentical in their symbolism. It must be remembered that the virgin at the centre of the maze, the Melusine,was also a Morrigan who fed on virgin blood. This practice is echoed in thestory of the blood letting of Parcival's sister and the symbol of the healingblood of Christ (properly the blood of his mother or wife). The web of Fairy magic drew maidens and youths in as sacrifices. However, if therite was reversed and they were drawn in to feed themselves, then they were tofeed on Fairy “food”, of which priest-ridden, terrified humans said that at thefirst taste, one remains in Elphame, damned forever. The “food” stills the chattering monkey in the head, changes consciousness anddeepens perception and one can no longer see the mundane world of petty mortalcare, where the trivial is of such import. One sees instead a realm of wider,deeper meaning that in other cultures is called the Kingdom of Heaven. One ishealed and “saved” by the Blood. Amen! In other traditions the condemned were forced to tread the labyrinth on theCommon before being hanged from “The Gallows Tree”. In some distant memory, theexecutors of the condemned man's fate believed that in walking the maze first,the convict's spirit would be loosened from his body and more readily set freeupon execution, in a similar fashion to those who, it was believed, were hangedat crossroads. This is dimly reminiscent of the more profound idea of the maze concealing atits centre the truth of enlightenment and the freeing quality that transcendencehas upon consciousness. In this idea, as in religious observance, the centralmystery and its mechanics have been lost, to be replaced by superstitiousmimicry. Nevertheless, as evidence, it reveals historical ideas about the nature andfunction of the labyrinth.* At the end of the maze lay death on a tree. At theend of Theseus' journey through the labyrinth he slew the Minotaur, himself.Having died to one state of consciousness, Theseus united with Ariadne and wasborn into another state of perception altogether. We have dealt with the conceptof death on a tree where the tree represents the female for and upon whom thehero sacrifices his life and through whom he obtains wisdom. * The maze as Time, related to the spinning of the web of fate, is a veryinteresting concept and by its design implies that time folds back on itself inlayers. Depending on what time width one imagines, instead of time being solelylineal, it might be suggested by the maze design that periods are folded on topof one another. This can be compared to the skins of an onion or the web of aspider, so that the Greek classical period might lie just beneath the medievalperiod, which itself might be covered by the Victorian age. This might go someway in explaining why some ages seem to wish to revive the former glories ofother particular ages past. If they are adjacent to each other in the time fold,then it seems likely that they may influence each other, just as they do inlineal time. The corollary of this is the shamanic concept of chronologicalfilaments or spirals packed against each other. In another sense the labyrinth represents the ever moving, spiralling vortex ofthe galaxy and the cosmos at whose centre there is utter stillness as in thecentre of the maze, the journey's end; death of the lesser self, stillness andrelease. Thus the centre of the maze is the nix, the nil point, the womb and thetomb, where the worm of fear dies and is reborn as the embryo of newconsciousness. "},{"pageContent":"[images/00071.jpg] PART TWO Chapter 9 The Cult of Ankou IntroductionIn Scythian warfare, the mounted warriors had one or several amongst theirnumber who rode backwards and naked, painted black from head to foot. He or theywould carry a pig’s bladder on a pole. These men would ride headlong, so tospeak, into the opposing ranks and select individuals whom they would beatacross the head with the bladder. As they rode back to their own ranks they grimaced at the enemy and poked outtheir tongues. The enemy often viewed this behaviour with a degree ofconsiderable alarm, borne in response to a belief system which was commonly heldby both sides, even when one side was Roman. This practice has been named“counting the Kou” (possibly also related to the Persian kuh: mountain, perhapsas a sacred hill, place of the gods and hence ka; the spirit, double etc.). Itwas a method employed to select the most useful spirits for captivation afterdeath, which must have been a terrifying prospect. It was likely that one would die horribly anyway, that being the nature ofclassical warfare, especially against the Lords of Death, the Vampiric,cannibalistic Scythians. However, if one were selected (Valkirie comes from theword “to select”) one’s soul, post mortem, was destined to become either thefood of savage gods or the slave of foreign chieftains. The poking of the tongue is also seen in medieval pictures of demons which wasprobably inspired by these Dragon Warriors. They select, capture, and condemnthe souls of the damned. This is related directly to the symbol of the tongue asthe lingham, the utterer of the Word of Law, Fate and the Pneuma or Spirit, theKa. These black warriors were probably the counterparts of the black Morrigans orBruidhinas, the female judge-bards whose word was law, whose “spells” were“fatal” in the proper sense. To be struck by one of these meant certaindamnation after life with no chance of avoiding the inevitable. In a sense these warriors were male Valkiries, the dark Repha'im who, like theMorganas, did a bit of moonlighting (literally!) and doubled up as Swan Knightson their days off. The tongue pointed at one intimated that the act of one’sselection was inevitable and irreversible, and meant also that your enemy, bydoing this and thus “revealing his spirit” his Kou or Ka, after taking your own,considered you to be no threat at all. Is it any wonder that the Church drewupon such images to populate their demonologies? It seems entirely appropriate to model the fiends of the pit (OFr. Kou) of Hellupon such terrifying characters who claimed to be able to take the fallenwarrior's very soul, having first tortured the body briefly but neverthelessunspeakably in life, on a field of battle that must have seemed to the observerto be the opening up of Hades itself. It was in such battle conditions that theentire Roman Ninth Legion, after crossing the Antonine Wall were utterlydefeated, eaten and, one suspects, spiritually enslaved by the Pictish Scythiansof Caledonia. Not one Roman escaped the carnage. Related to the word Ankh are: Anjou, Angouleme, Anschau, Ankou. The cult of theAnkou or Ankh involves consonant migration. It is shown in changes in phoneticaccentuation, regional pronunciation, fashion, the vocalisation of the words bynon-native speakers and the copying of manuscripts by foreign scholars or thescribes of subsequent generations. In this case it appears that the original word Ankh has developed into Anjou viaa linguistic path influenced by Goidelic. Spelt “Ankh” the H in Gaelic wouldhave become aspirant which would have been pronounced Ank-Huh or Ankuh. Verballythe K became mistaken for a hard G, giving Anguh. In due course the G becamenon-Goidelic and soft, as in “germ” and, with the emergence of the letter J as asofter variant of the soft G, the Word Ankh, via Ankhu, Ankou and Angou (as inAngouleme) became Anjou. The Cult of the Ankou in Brittany and Anjou, the Cult of the Spirit of the An,derivatively, therefore the Cult of the Dragon's Breath, prior to itsintroduction to the continent, is asserted to have been of immediate Britishorigin. However, it was strongly represented in the island now known as Irelandin pre-Christian times, where it was probably originally introduced first by theEgyptian Princess Scota, the wife of the governor (or king) of the Red Sea nome,Niall of Scythia (see charts). It is said that it was introduced into Brittany during one of the migrationsfrom Albany in the first millennium AD. Described as a cult of the dead, therites and symbols associated with the characters who were claimed or appear tobe its royal priests and priestesses reveal that it was also a cult of blood anddeath, as well as ancestor veneration. In lowland Scotland the spoken tongue wasNorthern Cymric and in this language “angev”, it is said, is one of the wordsused to describe death, possibly suggesting “going to the Dragon”, the Church's“Devil”. It is significant linguistically because those of the later house of Plantagenetwere called the Angevin Kings, emphasising, along with the name Angouleme, theconsonant migration described above and adding some veracity to the Angevinclaim that they were descended from the Devil. “We who came from the devil mustneed go back to the Devil. Do not deprive us of our heritage, we cannot helpacting like devils”—Richard Coeur de Lyon. Or, as the Monkish sponsor of theKnightsTemplar, St. Bernard of Clairvaux put it when describing the Angevins:“De Diabolo Venit Et AD Diabolum Ibit”. The syllable Ang in Angev is also to be found in Angel and derives from theGreek aggelos—aggelos which is reminiscent of Agg or Ygg, the Odin priest as anangel, a Repha'im or priest of Nergal. Freja, as a goddess of the Earth and theunderworld, was the proud owner of a heron or crane-skin bag and a Merlinfeathered cloak. Odin wanted to borrow these from her from time to time, makinghim a Merlin figure and linking her to the sacred and sinister bird of theDruids. One of the explanations for the name of the Fir Bolg was “Bag Men”.Related to the crane-skin bag, the Fir Bolg are Merlins or Druids and thus Fir“Bog”, “Men of God”. The Merlin itself was described as a “bird without a nest”, a solitary wandererin exactly the same sense as was the magical boar, “Le Solitaire”. The boar asthe “The Hermit”, the solitary Archdruid, the lonely wanderer, is the Merlin wholikewise ranges alone, thus indicating that Merlins, Odins and Archdruids weresynonymous. On the island of Delos the dance of the labyrinth was called Geranos, the “Danceof the Crane” and is suggestive of the Druidic ritual of “Crane pointing” as aform of related magical observance. The Crane Dance, known in Britain as the“Dance of Troy”, was also performed by the Ostiak peoples of Siberia up untilthe 18th century and was so-called because they wore crane skin clothing for theoccasion. Principally the Ankh or Ankou in Brittany were described as being a collateralcult of the Morrigan which was particularly prominent in the Breton coastalregions. As such this would suggest that the Ankou had some influence upon theArmorican cult of the Ferryman of the Dead, particularly as Morgana herself isassociated with the Swan Barge of Avalon, which transported the dead Mordred tohis final resting place in the sacred grove. In Eire the Cult of Ankou was associated with Sidhe mounds, Raths, hills andBarrows, and hence labyrinths. Known as Mari in the Basque region and associatedwith the Morias or fates, Ankou was the original model for the Black Madonnasthere. The goddess Ankou, Black Annis, was derived from the Greek “Anku-Kis” whowas a form of the earlier Egyptian Goddess of the underworld—Anu Ket. In theSemitic-Ugaritic texts found in Ras Shamra in 1928, Ankou is called Anat, aWitch goddess and regeneratrix who shapeshifted into the form of the Morrigan orMorgana, a black predatory bird. We are here in the presence of “An”, the ancient Dragon Mother who is both asustainer and a reaper, a Phoenix figure whose Raven-like attributes link her tothe Kershalyi and Locolico of the first Dragon homeland of Transylvania. InBreton Churches her priestess Morgana is portrayed as a wouivre, ordouble-tailed mermaid, or Dragoness and in this respect she is identical withanother Priestess, Ygraine. The Cult of the Ankh or Ankou was the Court of the Dragon of Ankh-fnKhonsu andhis successor Sobekhnefru, whose most sacred inner symbol, historically, was thewinged Orobouros with a pendant Greek cross. It was also the Court of the Dragonof the Ankh of Nin-Kursag or Hathor, and her daughter Innana or Venus. Intracing the history of one, via Egypt to its ancient Sumerian roots, weinevitably therefore recount the story of the other. They are, therefore, thesame thing and represent The Realm of the Dead (or more pertinently, preciselyand poetically “The Undead”), Tir N'an Og, Elysium, the Court of the Kingdom ofElphame, the Grove of the Swan Maidens and the Hall of the Dragon Lords of theRings, the Repha'im or Rapha Elohim. Later on, following Ygraine, the Fairy Melusine of Anjou who descended from her,was also portrayed in this manner as a wouivre, especially and also in medievalreligious architecture. Related to this theme, in the cathedral of Le Mans onthe Anjou-Maine border near Rennes, there is a carving of two serpent-taileddoves, called Serpilions and derived from the Persian “Smenda”. Anotherrepresentation of the Dragon is the serpent-necked Swan. The Dove is sacred to Venus and is particularly associated with the Virgin MaryMagdalene, whose name “Magdala”, according to some writers, means the place ofdoves, e.g. the temple of the cult of Hathor or Venus —Ishtar. In Albany the“place of doves” was Camlann or Camelot and the association with Morgana andMelusine and the Ladies of Avalon, and thus the priestesses of the cult of theAnkh (of Hathor or Venus), is apparent. The Ankh of Hathor, according to Gettings, is generally believed to be thesource for the astrological symbol of her daughter Inanna or Venus, whosemagical colour is that of Elphame. In addition, Emma Jung reminds us that whenthe Grail appears as a “stone”, it is presented on a green silk cloth, whichreasserts the link between the stone and the emerald of Venus. The colour green in alchemy is the Benedicta Viriditas, the colour of the HolySpirit or Sophia, the wisdom gained by the hero who, on completing the “questfor the Holy Grail”, is awarded the Green Cloak or Greenmantle. Green Stags (theRobin Hoods) are one of the Grail badges or totems of the lords of the forestwhich entered heraldry in the armorial achievements of some families. The GreenStag amongst other things represents the transcendent king, the Fairy lord ofthe forest, blessed of a Fairy queen. Stags drinking from Grail Chalices arequite common subjects for bas relief sculpture. The links to green as the Elven colour are obvious and indicate that: a) the Holy Spirit is immanent within nature or the cosmos, i.e. that theuniverse and God are One Being andb) the Fairies already possess the Holy Spirit of God by virtue of blood andbirth, not through the consent of some priest. Therefore they are naturallyeternal beings and in no need of forgiveness of sin, because they, the sons ofthe Repha'im as the true Children of God, don't and can't commit any sin. The Key of LifeIt can be asserted that the Fairy or Dragon cult of the Goddess Ankou, althoughnot originating there, was, in any event, maintained in Albany, where Morganawas born and ritually active. Having established this, it is likely that thelater kingdom of Anjou, formerly known as Pictavia, derived its name from apriest or priestess, or a court of the Ankh which settled there from the Bretoncoast. If this was Melusine, the founder of the Pictavian House of Anjou, then Melusinewould have been known as “Melusine d'Ankou” or “Melusine of the cult of theAnkh” prior to moving there. That in itself is almost certain, as it would befor the other Avalonian princesses. However, the idea that she actually foundedthe kingdom itself is not certain. The realm of the Anjou, as stated, was passeddown by inheritance it seems, from the reigning Vere Tigherna “Vortigern” to thegrandson of Merlin Emrys III; Guy de Marys, who was already a prominent figurein Breton legend. Guy de Marys, reputedly a Vere ancestor, was also know as Kai, Cai or Kay, thelatter spelling meaning both Quay and Key, in relation to which the Ankh wascalled both the Key of the Nile and the Key of Life. Guy was a Merlin and aDruid or Magus, specifically a Bard of the Golden Bough who descended to Hades,by classical Greek description and definition, and as stated, he would have beena revealer (anschau) and binder of mysteries. As a “spell” master, a binder andloosener of lives, a male Fata or Mori, one of the Fairy Race. The presence of the cult in Brittany suggests that the Anjou or Ankou, as theOtherworld kingdom of the dead was moved, as a rite, from northern Pictavia tosouthern Pictavia in Gaul. Here it gave its name to a region which then becameits cultic kingdom, years before either Morgana or Melusine were born. It is more likely therefore that Emrys II—Ambrosius Aurelius—introduced the cultto the region when he decamped to Brittany sometime after the defeat ofRhydderch, which would then help to explain Melusine's later presence there. Sheis said to have fled to Gaul from Northumbria with her Dragon Court, after theritual killing of her father in the same manner that Morgana killed Merlin.(Elinus' spirit was later deified, it would seem, and given symbolic giftofferings of milk, after a manner associated with the live “Dragons” who weregiven the semen or “milk”, and the blood of maidens; and were thought to inhabitcaves, or labyrinths, throughout Europe.) However it was unthinkable that aroyal Pictish princess would flee and wander through someone else's kingdomunannounced, as this could be construed as an act of invasion and war. Such astory seems to be a later justification of her presence there. But as a priestess of the Ankou in Scottish Pictaivia, she would have beenwelcome in the other land known as Pictavia, where her cousin Rainfroi, thethird great grandson of Ambrosius, reigned as the Archdruid of the Golden Bough,the hereditary, ritual king of the dead. As it is, they, who were bothpatricides, were destined to marry, which would strengthen the dynasty, and thusthe migration was a planned event. In any case the cult, with its ancient Irishassociations predates Vortigern, and we should be looking back further still forits origins. Essentially the British-Gallic Cult of the Ankou is related to a symbol sacredto Horus' supposed wife: Hathor-Venus, and to Isis and Nephthys— the Ankh. Thesedeities appear to be related to each other in the same triple goddessconfiguration found in the rest of Europe and the Levant. The draconian Ankoucult is a regional variant therefore, perhaps the origin, of the Greek cult ofPersephone as described in the foregoing essay on the labyrinth. (Isis andNephthys are also both, amongst other things, goddesses of the dead.) In the Funerary Cult of Egypt, the nobility employed Ka-Priests to tend thedead. This is linked to a strong thread of ancestor veneration which is alsofound in Scythian culture. Though the Faiyum Labyrinth has long since beenreclaimed by the sands, the massive labyrinth complex of funerary palaces in the25-26th dynasty necropolis standing next to the temple of Hatshepsut in Deirel-Bahari is still in existence. At the centre of the complex is situated thesacred sanctuary which has an adjoining cell which is commonly recognised as theutmost Holy of Holies, the singular feature of which is the carved Ankh Crosswhich dominates its facing wall. In the Papyrus of Ani dated 1300 BC, Isis and Nephthys are depicted as standingon either side of the Ankh and holding aloft, above its loop, the solar discwhich relates to the Sephiroth of Kether, also called the Ajna Chakra,symbolised by the “thousand-petalled lotus”. This lotus in Egypt was associatedwith the psychotropic Nile Lily; and the generic symbol of the lily in all itsnational variations, was associated with the Grail and Dragon Families. Thesubject of the lily will be studied in some detail later on. In pre-Christian Gaul it appears on the carved heads of chieftains whoseeffigies were incorporated into architectural columns and at a very earlyperiod, prior to its adoption by the Comité of Paris, the lily or “fleur de lys”was the badge of the early Kingdom of Anjou. The shape of the fleur de lys seemsto have been influenced, in its present form, by a very important Gallic magicalrune which was within a group of symbols derived from, or related to, theprototype of the Ankh. The lines of the fleur de lys' basic structure pass through two planes and twoangles to form a St. Andrews Cross overlaid upon a Greek Cross in the manneremployed to create the Norse binding runes. From the evolution of this figure itis thought that the Chi Rho was developed as a later form of the Ankh. Thiseight-armed cross appears in the Canary Islands cut into the bottom of the bowlrecesses which were carved into the top of stones outside sacred caves,duplicating the concept of the cup and ring stones one can find throughoutBritain. As was the case in the offerings made to Melusine's father outside the cave inNorthumbria, in the Canary Islands, milk was also poured into these depressionsand left to trickle away down the side of the monolith. The eightarmed figurewas believed by the islanders to be sacred to Isis, the virginal High Priestessof Waite's alchemical Tarot. It was said to be her “milk”, the dew of the fleurde lys or rosicrucis, that flowed from the eight-armed cross to form the MilkyWay, the spiral vortex or labyrinth of the “cosmic” Dragon, the Orouborus whichfeatures in the cross of the Dragon Court. The fleur de lys itself is so configured as to contain within it both the Ankhand the Chi Rho. The figure of the fleur de lys, as a Gallic rune, comprises inthe Norse of Nyd as +, an equal armed cross meaning both need and death, Gifu asX meaning union and Wyn as a loopless P meaning victory. Translated, this forms the ritual process encapsulated in the rite of thelabyrinth. The P lost its loop during symbol migration, a phenomenon documentedby the Count d'Alviella in his book The Migration of Symbols, some components ofwhich I will draw upon later and reproduce the figures for. In essence there are several related crosses that, although thought to havedeveloped from each other serially, belong to a very ancient group of symbolsemployed within the royal Dragon culture. Within this culture, the rites ofancestor veneration and communication associated with the central mortuary themeof the cult of the Ankou form an integral and timeless component which is wellknown. The Sacred AnThe Chi Rho, which is suggested should be the symbol for the Swan Knights, isdeveloped from the Ankh itself which in turn forms the basis for the fleur delys. In Melusine's time, the field of lilies, the arms of Anjou, represented thePictish virgin princesses coveted by other dynasties, which are the liliesfeatured in the earlier Song of Solomon. These lilies or Anjous/Ankhous/Ankh maidens, sacred to the various Goddessesmentioned herein, are the Bruidhinas, the Morrigan/Valkiries and Swan princessesof the Dragon Dynasty which the Swan Knights were sworn to protect. Their symbolIS the Chi Rho Ankh which, instead of just representing the XP, the firstletters of the name of Christ the Man, latterly conceals the true nature andgender of the Christos itself, which is of the rtu, first flow of the womb, ofthe Ankh, the Goddess. Consequently, the Chi Rho itself is a female Dragon symbol related to bothMorgana and Melusine, as well as all the other Ladies of the Lake: mermaids,naiads, nixes, virgin priestesses and so forth. The earlier history of the ChiRho, the Ankh and the Haegl rune which forms the fleur de lys can be found inthe development of Mesopotamian cuneiform from earlier Sumerian pictograms. In Sumerian the symbol represents “An”: the Star. The star pictogram laterbecame cuneiform with the wedges forming the ends of the top branch or ray, andthe subsequent three rays going down the left-hand flank of the glyph. At thisstage the symbol came to represent the “Heavens” and its final cuneiformrepresentation was as an equal-armed cross with a wedge at the end of the topray and two wedges on the left arm which represented the gods. This figure isclose to variant representations of the Ankh in medieval black magic where thetop arm is an enlarged triangle whilst the other arms have smaller wedge ends. The common translation of the word Christ is “anointed one”. Libatio, from theroot libare, meaning “to taste”, “to pour” (as Mary of Bethany is said to haveanointed Christ) is, however, closely related to this concept. Libare is relatedto the Greek leibein, to pour, drop by drop, translated as “to pour out (wineetc.) in honour of a god.” (OED.) Wine is not uniquely specified, but any liquid is—meaning that Libare andLibatio are not solely confined to the act of the libation of wine to a god. Ithas been suggested that some Greeks would argue that “Christos” meant gold andthat would then intimate that the idea of anointing, in relation to the Grail,was derivative and attributive. In the Greek Orthodox Bible, Christ is described as the “Golden One” fromCrusos—Gold; rather than Cristos—to anoint. Here we are, back to Christ as the“red-gold” flow, an anointing or libation of virgin blood of the Labrus orLabia. Libare is also related to Liber or Bacchus the god of “wine”, and here weare reminded of the later Christian doctrine of transubstantiation and theirsubstitution of wine for blood. In Mithraism the blood of the bull was poured from above onto the supplicants asan anointing chrism and a libatory eucharist drink. Therefore the idea oflibation being solely TO a god is incorrect, as often the gods, or indeed thegoddesses' blood, was shed as both an anointing and libation for their flock.Further on, we shall encounter “anointing” not as Christos, but as murizeinwhich has its own surprises. Jesus' surname is ben Panther, meaning the Leopard, which is the totem steed ofboth Bacchus and Diana and is repeated in the arms of the House of Plantagenetas three (originally one) heraldic leopards “Or” on a field “Gules”, or threegolden leopards on a field of blood. The archaic spelling for Leopard is Libardand this night-stalking animal is renowned for drinking the blood of its victimsprior to eviscerating and consuming the carcass. Here again is a variant of theword Libare and quite a pertinent one at that, as again blood becomes a Libationassociated with Christ the son of the Libard, as the anointed anointer, thelibater, the initiator. Christianity is substantively a prime example of the reversal of libation and inthis it attempts to mimic earlier Bacchanalian ritual. Royal anointing in postCarolingian Christian ritual uses the oil of the chrism, representing the HolySpirit. The Vatican uses this right to create kings from peasants and merchants.One assumes that by transubstantiation, royal anointing is treated as though itwere delivered in obedience to the will of God by proxy through his chosenpriesthood, who intended it to take the place of royal blood in the veins. It is suspected that the etymology of the name Christ was tampered with in orderto accommodate this anointing ritual and to derive the usurped social power thatattends upon it. Along with the service of communion this is another Catholicversion of reverse libation with blessings being showered upon the grateful by abeneficent priesthood. Libare is related, via “to taste”, to labia—lips and libant means “tasting” or“touching lightly”, obviously with the lips. Lake or Del Acqs, sometimes writtenas Lac, represents the lily and the rose: the Roman dye “Lac”: the crimson flow,and Lac or Lactose: the white “milk” of the maidens. Within the cellular andgenetic fabric of these substances was retained the Ankh'a or Ka of the An, theHoly Spirit and power of the Dragon Gods—the ka of the An: the soul of theHeavens. The crimson flow and the “milk and honey” (Nectar or Ambrosia; cf. the name ofthree generations of Merlins above) of the priestesses can be adequately andcorrectly described as their sacrificial libation. This is the “blood of theChristos” shed for the remission of sins (Hebrew: “Sin”—“falling short of themark”; perceptual blindness, the living death). The spurting of “milk” relates to La Fontaine de Soif, so called because it“sprays out”, like a fountain, from the cubic stone. This symbolism is derivedfrom the ejaculatory propensity of the Graffenberg gland which ejects itsseminal fluid, the sacred “milk and honey” or nectar, like a jet. Poured ontothe Ankh figure in the cup stone by the sacred cave or labyrinth, the substitutemilk of Isis is perhaps not symbolic breast milk, but an allegory for herseminal fluid, inundating the symbolic vulva, the Ankh, from whence itoriginates. It should also be noted, however, that breast milk itself containsTelomerase, a sort of bicycle puncture repair kit for infant DNA. One issupposed to see a connection here, I think. The Ankou cult and the ancient form of the Ankh are therefore associated withcaves and thus labyrinths and with the holy female essence. Both Morgana andMelusine of Anjou or Ankhou are closely associated with such elements, as HighPriestesses and ritual representatives, in a line of succession which goes backthrough the Pictish Fairy Princesses or Swan Maidens, beyond Sobekhnefru and theEgyptian Ankh Goddesses to the Sumerians and Babylonians. Their goddesses Ast(Isis) Nebt-Hat (Nephthys), Nin-Kursag (Hat-Hor) and Lilith, from whom Melusine,Morgana and the Ladies of the Lake are descended, all bear the symbol whichforms the loop of the Ankh, which was first entrusted to the god Thoth, who wasthe Sumerian Nin.Gish.Zi.Da: the Lord of the Artifact of Life, son of Enki andEresh Kigal (Persephone-Demeter). Likewise Magdalene, the daughter of the Jireh Priest of the Temple of Jerusalem,was a Priestess of this lineage and the matriarch of the Ankh Priestesses inAlbany. Known as a Scarlet Woman, she was so-called because of the colour of theLac-dyed ceremonial robes she wore as a senior officiate, the blood tinctureindicating her ritual obligation. The term Scarlet Woman became associated with prostitutes because Magdalene, asa temple priestess, in her relationship to Jesus as a Pharaonic, Dragon Messiah,or God-King, fulfilled the role of the goddess Hathor or the Judaic Astaroth,the Sabbath or Matronit in the esoteric, Kabalistic aspects of Jewish spiritualphilosophy. This role involved her in forms of ritual “congress” or Enthea, ofthe type specified in the Song of Solomon, which are also found in the TantricKaula Vama Marg and repeated later by the Avalonese Virgins of the Holy Blood. Astaroth was the Goddess of the Shekinah, the divine presence of the Eternalwithin the Solomonic Temple of Jerusalem. To the early Gnostics she was recordedas representing the Sophia or Holy Spirit, the (feminine) principle of DivineWisdom. Later, Astaroth (a denizen of the Devil in the medieval demonologies)continued to be recognised by the Cathar Christians as a symbol of the HolySpirit. During Jesus' life, Astaroth was therefore manifest in the person ofMagdalene as Christ's consort in accordance with Apocryphal doctrines, in muchthe same way that Ishtar, Matronit and Lilith, as early priestesses of theShekinah began as the consorts of Enki, Enlil, the Dragon God-Kings and laterJehovah. In this Mary too, fulfilled the role of the Anunnaki blood mothers who fed theDragon God-Kings. As the physical embodiment of Astaroth, the Sophia orShekinah, within the Egyptian Therapeutate she was Hathor-Venus, whose crossderived from the Ankh, and as Ishtar, the morning and evening star, shepersonified “war” in the mornings (Seratonin) and “love” in the evenings(Melatonin). After Ishtar's example, the progeny of the Anunnaki dynasty, the Rephaim orAngels, who became the Elven, Dragon Maidens and Knights of Albany, Eire andGaul, fulfilled two roles, that of destroyers and reapers, and that of divinelovers and healers. Under the patronage of Ishtar or her mother—Hathor (Nin-Kursag) of the Ankh orAnkhou, (and later, under two of the principal Astaroth matriarchs, Magdalene ofthe Green Dress and Anna, her granddaughter, who migrated to Albany and marriedinto the colateral PenDragon dynasty)—the Rephaim of Pictavia and Eire, wereboth the Swan Princesses. They were vessels of the benedicta viriditas, and theMorganas and Valkiries, the Priestesses of the Ankou and the Guardians of theCult of Blood and Death. In this way the Cult of the Ankhou gained a collateral line which descendedthrough the posterity of the Druidic families to the Mistletoe Bards andPriestesses. From the Letter to Ceretius we know that Jesus performed a sacredrole as the central figure within the circle dances that, in conjunction withhis secret teachings and his rituals of initiation (Morton Smith), he conductedat night. In the Letter, Jesus is recorded as saying at one night-time gathering “TheEight Are With Us”. These are the Egyptian Ogdoad or eight Great Spirits ofGnosticism which are also found in Taoism. The Eight Spirits are the second waveof creators (after the Cosmic Twins) that appeared tilling on the sacredmountain of the “rising land” that emerged after the flood. They appear in anillustration in the Book of the Dead of Khensumose: Third Intermediate Period,21st dynasty circa 1075-945 BC. Evidence for the existence of this belief priorto the pre-Ptolomeic period is derived from its worship site at Hermopolis whose“Eight Town” quarter existed at the time of the Fifth Dynasty: 2498-2345 BC. “The Eight” when reflected upon in relation to Ubaid or Sumerian traditionrepresent the Anunnaki, the original gods of Egypt, salvaging the remains oftheir civilisation after the Black Sea inundation. The story has been transposedto Egypt, like so many stories that travel with their tribes, and becomes thecreation myth of the Pharaohs. The Ogdoad, also found in China as we have noted, are some of the sons anddaughters of Enki-Samael (Ptah) and Ninkhursag (Hat-Hor). Enki sired Ningal fromNinkhursag, and Eresh Kigal from Ningal, it would appear. Eresh Kigal, mother ofLilith, gave birth to eight deities—Abu, Nintulla, Ninsutu, Ninkashi, Nazi,Azimua, Nintu and Enshag; (Sitchin). That Jesus, as an initiate, invokes them,suggests that he had a firm Egyptian, gnostic ritual background which has itsorigins in Dragon kingship, manifesting itself later in medieval Witchcraft.This reinforces and supports an argument for the role of Jesus' wife as hisPriestess of Hathor-Astaroth and points to her lineage becoming a contributivebloodline to the pre-existent cult of the Ankou in Albany and Pictavia. It is significant that the Ogdoad are also known in Scandinavia, where they arecalled the Aia. The Norse have a diagram of the sacred mound as a square whichalso shows the compass points and the migration of the eight tribes of the Godsfrom the Holy Mountain. This is of some interest because people are used to the Anunnaki being presentedas a small council of deities. In fact they were a race of people who were stillknown as the Anukim in Canaan in 1200 BC, 760 years after Enlil's Anunnaki courthad apparently fled Babylon in 1960 BC. Corroborating the migration myths of theDanaan in the Irish Liebhar Gabhala, the Aia migration glyph suggests thateventually at least one of the tribes of the Anunnaki settled in the north,whilst another, the Danaan, headed west following “a flood”. The location of the sacred mound would then seem not necessarily to have beenEgypt but, given the broad dispersal of the Ogdoad story, it would probably havebeen a site from where the gods originally migrated. The most obvious locationis Aryan Scythia, near the Black Sea region. It is quite possible that the timeframe for this migration was 4000 BC, when the Bosphorus collapsed and the Ubaidfled south to Sumeria. Later they became the gods of Egypt and it is feasiblethat the story of the “tilling of the sacred mound” migrated there with theAnunnaki—Ubaid deities. Venus or Venal?The Druids welcomed the Culdee into Britain as brothers in spirit and fellowDruids. Columba called Jesus a Druid (of the order of Magi) and the linksbetween primal Christianity and Druidism are quite apparent. Jesus (a harrowerof hell like Orpheus-Bacchus), Odin and Theseus were born in caves. Like Merlinand Elinus, Jesus was buried in one, in a garden which was arguably aNecromaniton, or Druidic sacred grove with a funerary cell. Jesus initiated MaryMagdalene into the Egyptian Therapeutate. She was twelve at the time and he was, according to the Bible, about thirtyyears old. The ritual employed was similar to that in which Lazarus partook, inthat it involved symbolic death and resurrection. See Luke 8: verse41-56. Following her initiation and during the period of her early adolescence,as was common practice, Mary would have acted as Jesus' handmaiden or grailpriestess. Botticelli's “Birth of Venus” is described by Graham-Dixon as an analogy of theVirgin Mary. In the depiction of the red-haired Venus, however, there is asupposed sexual analogy represented in the various folds of fabric and hairwhich are arranged by the painter to suggest the vulva which remains covered byher modesty. It isn't likely that the darling of the Roman Church would havebeen depicted in this manner. Botticelli wouldn't have got away with it in aperiod when Galileo was being threatened with death for suggesting that theearth was an orbiting sphere. One could do virtually anything with the Magdalenehowever. Common sense would, in any case, suggest that the Mary depicted was in fact theMagdalene and that the painting was a deliberate though esoteric attempt torecord what was commonly known about her race, her position and her function,amongst alchemists and Rosicrucians during the Renaissance period. Thesuggestive folds were made in red cloth festooned with flowers and here we mighthave an intimation of the spiritual fertility of the vulva in menstruus. Commentators have stated that Magdalene was a sacred prostitute, or priestess ofIshtar (daughter of Hathor). This can be explained by this particular phase ofher spiritual life where a certain type of congress, a secret outside the Cult,would have led to her being suspected of being a prostitute in some orthodoxJewish opinion, as she was not married at the time. It is very probable,however, that the so-called Rites of Venus she ritually engaged in with theMessiah have been confused with other definitions of the word venal, whichpertains not only to sex, but to payment for any service or goods. The confusion between the words Venus and Venal has led to the error where itwas thought that Magdalene was a prostitute, who was “paid” for “Venal”services. In the Egyptian tradition of Jesus' ancestor Solomon, however, Mary—apriestess of the rites of Hathor within the Egyptian Therapeutate—would, likeSheba, have been a young Shunnamite, a donor of womb blood and the “Water ofLife”, a Lily of the Valley and a Rose of Sharon. After Jesus’ death, Magdalene went to the cell and found it open. Rather, Iwould argue that in accordance with the traditional ritual that accompanied herstation, she was expected to stay in the cell and commune with the Ka of Jesusin the underworld. Few people actually knew the real reason why she went. Thereason people might have assumed would be that it would have been expected of aPriestess of an Egyptian Cult. In Celtic countries and in Egypt this was commonpractice, as in the cases where it has been demonstrated that tombs had livingquarters in them. That she went to heal him of his non-fatal wounds was a secret known only to aninitiated few, among whom the apostles, it seems, were not counted. In any caseshe was the first to “see” him, and in this she fulfills precisely the role ofthe Sibyl or shamanka, the Druidess of Cumae, Medea of the Golden Fleece,Ariadne, and numerous other females, including the Witch of Endor. In Revelation22: v. 16 Jesus, clothed as a Repha'im, proclaims himself the Root and Branch ofDavid, the Bright and Morning Star. Amongst other things, including being the Priest-King of Lucifer, Jesus alsoproclaims himself as a High Priest of Hathor, who is the mother of Ishtar,Astaroth, Shekinah, Sophia and Venus, the Star of the Morning. It becomesincreasingly difficult to see Mary Magdalene therefore as anything less than acentral character in a collateral Druidic cult of the dead, a priestess of theAnkou of Ishtar. In such a capacity, as with the various cavedwelling shamankasin mythology, she would have acted in a twofold role both as a visionary andalso as a guide and companion, a facilitator whose blood allowed access to theunderworld or Cosmic Consciousness. Her essence and elan was the Dergflaith of sovereignty, the pomegranate wine ofPersephone that gained the Bard of the Golden Bough, the Hero of Mythology,entrance to the land of Elphame, the Kingdom of Ankou. In this ritual capacity,Morgana, Melusine and La Fille du Lac et la Fonteine; followed her example anddemonstrated a lineal descent as living goddesses, from at least one of the Ankhcults of antiquity. In the Bible, the narrator writes that a sword will separate the quick from thedead. The sword is the Spirit and the Spirit, as we have seen, is alsosymbolised by the tongue, and by fire. In Latin a sword sheath is called avaginum. It is the use of the “sword” which separates the quick, the livingspirits (the Elves), from the dead or the dead in life. In other words it is therite of the Maiden, the “christos of salvation” that gives life. References to the Sword as the Holy Spirit in the Bible include Revelations 1:v. 16— “Out of his mouth went a sharp, two edged sword. In his hand he heldSeven Stars”, said to represent the seven Churches of Asia. It is interesting tonote the association here between Bacchus and the Pleiades. In John of Patmos'vision, the Alpha and Omega figure: Jesus, is dressed in the garb of an Angel orRepha'im. Hebrews 4: v. 12— “The “word” (pneuma/spirit) of God is a two edgedsword”. Ephesians 6: v. 17— “Take the helmet of salvation and the Sword of theSpirit”. According to the story of the Pentecost, the Holy Spirit descended upon thedisciples like “tongues of fire”. This is a symbol which, connected to theforegoing, is especially relevant in relation to the Dragon, whose fiery breathis a symbol of the Holy Spirit, the “Word” of God, the Torah; or the Law ofDestiny determining the progress of mankind's fate. The sword is an Ankh symbol with the blade representing the tongue, the guardrepresents the Grail dish or womb, the spiralled grip symbolises the spinalcolumn, and the pommel (from Fr. la Pomme, the little apple) represents thepineal and its chakra. In the medieval Grimoire, The Clavicula Salomanis, the guard of the magicalsword is constructed of two crescent moons back to back. The sheathed sword,symbolising Peace, represents hierogamy and balance, oneness and union. The story of Arthur and the Sword in the Stone is translated by some to meanthat Arthur became king because he knew how to extract iron from stone. Assmithing was a part of alchemy and thus a king’s science, some scholarsconcluded that in order to become king, Arthur would need to convince peoplethat he knew where iron came from. The Iron Age had been extant for over a thousand years before the Druids firsttold this story. In a pre-industrialised society that depended on iron foreverything and where nearly every moderately sized village had a smithy, Arthurwould have already known how to extract iron from rocks and other people wouldhave known that Arthur knew. The age of secret metal magic had long since passedby his time. It has to be emphasised that a fascinating new theory has arisenthat associates the Sword in the Stone motif with the far earlier skill ofcasting bronze weapons in stone moulds. Nevertheless, in relation to Arthur thissymbol would be irrelevant, and so we are still left seeking an alternativeexplanation. The Sword-Stone tale operates on two levels of organic (not metallurgic)alchemy, and refers to the enthea resulting in transcendence, leading tosovereignty. The stone is both the cubic stone of the Ankh Goddess-Priestess andthe Lia Fail, the Stone of Destiny, a representative symbol of the macrocosmiccubic stone of the Earth as the anthropomorphised Goddess of Sovereignty. The sword is both the tongue in the first instance and the sword symbol ofderivative integrity, cosmic consciousness and resultant personal sovereignty inthe second. From such personal sovereignty comes the wisdom and creativity toadminister the sovereignty of the nation, thus qualifying Arthur to be a king. That he performed the job badly in the end is another matter. Even goddesseshave off days. They're only human after all. The sword in the stone says thatsovereignty rises from the womb of the Grail Maiden, the virgin Dragon Princess. The Sword as Tongue implies the method by which sovereignty is obtained.Elsewhere the pendant T bar of the Ankh glyph corresponds to Tau, the Law. Moreprecisely it is the Utterer of the Law, the Hindu Lingham or in Hebrew, thetongue of the Repha'im, the Fairy Bruidhe Bard in Gaelic, whose spells, or wordsof cosmic law, bound men's fate and, like the Morrigan warrior or Valkirie,represented the Holy Spirit. In the foregoing examples the symbolism sometimes tends to overlap because ofthe adaptation of the glyphs over the passing centuries. Pure symbols like theankh naturally evolve to become more complex with the addition of othercomponents, whilst still retaining the originals, which can double up sometimes,as in the case of the addition of the T to the rounded orb. On its own, the T isalready the lingham and yoni combined. Add this to the upper orb as the womb andthe symbol becomes reinforced, as in the following breakdown. To qualify the T component, we have to separate this symbol into two parts.Being specific, the upright corresponds to the tongue as utterer whilst thecrossbar, anciently dish-shaped like the new moon, represents the womb oruterus, also the utterer. The Tau was given to the priest-king by the womb. He passed it on as spells orlaws, with the tongue which drank the wisdom of the cosmic law from that womb.The cup/dish and stone, the moon or womb and pineal in this instance, being heldby a statue of Melchizadec, is situated outside the door of Chartres Cathedral,along with a figure of the Magdalene. This comes as no surprise. The Tau symbol can be found in Scandinavia associated with Tir, the God of Lawand Judgement whose rune became, in this century, the familiar crow's foot orupright arrow. The Tir mark was specifically the property of the king whose wordwas binding on all. Therefore the Tau or Tir element of the Ankh is, like theOmega from which it feeds, a royal symbol, intimating again the holy-sacralnature of the Grail ritual. The symbol of the Chi Rho of these Swan Princesses, as a derivative, later formof the Ankh, was known before Christ Jesus' lifetime, as was the IHS of Bacchus,whose story is connected here via the Ankh Cross as a crucifix. "},{"pageContent":"[images/00029.jpg]Chapter 10 The Wheel of Fate The adoption and modification of the Chi Rho Ankh by the Church was a late eventand it is said that the Chi Rho symbol was based on the six-pointed Gallic runebecause, as we shall see, the symbol had such tremendous influence. As we know, this rune was the Sumerian symbol for the gods. It invariablypreceded the name of any deity. Therefore, as the Chi Rho, in relation to Jesus,it was used to imply his divinity, not as the son of the Jewish storm and cornimp Jehovah, but as a God-King in his own right, as a descendant of the DragonGods of the Egyptians. The Church was and is a past master at assimilation for political ends. The useof the Chi Rho, like much else, must be seen as another way that the Churchsought to be identified and adopted by non-Christian Europeans. The six-pointed Gallic rune, similar to the Norse rune Haegl, would originallyhave been eight-spoked, like the Buddhist Wheel of Life or the Tarot's Wheel ofFortune. In this guise it is the Web of Arachne, the Web of Fate and the planview of the ribbons of the Maypole dance. The missing horizontal spoke of the Chi Rho is accounted for in its having beenoften carved into wood. Inevitably one spoke would always follow and disappearinto the grain, and so rune masters omitted it. According to Count d'Alviella, the Chi Rho is sometimes to be found in the loopof the Ankh itself. In Egypt the Chi Rho was known as the Chrism of Philae, orthe anointing of pure love. This indicates the Entheal nature of the symbol,particularly in relation to the Ankh itself, which in some creative work hasbeen thought of as the “Vampire cross” being, as it is, the symbol of eternallife and youth. Other examples have been discovered with the loop made of the Dragon Cross ofCain. The Ankh was said to have migrated into the Christian crucifix. This seemsobvious when one remembers the Celtic Cross, which would seem to support theforegoing, as does the pre-Christian cross of Bacchus and the Albigensian (orGaulish Fairy) use of the Ankh in relation to heterodox Christian belief andritual. The Bethel stone was shaped like an Ankh and had associations with the variouspine cone or Dove capped pillars, the Perrone of the sacred groves. At latertimes the Perrone were capped by crosses and the name seems to be reminiscentitself of Persephone. Later still, in European Heraldry, one can see the pinecone column in the Pyr of Augsburg. In particular these columns were associatedalso with barrows and bergs. In Belgium they were known as the Stones of Justice, which again links them withthe Tir or Tau and the Ankh, whilst in Scandinavia, according to the Saga ofGudrun, they become the white stone pillars (Gita/Cita) on the barrows whichwere venerated by the peasants. The white stone, as a portable panacea, featuresin the story of St. Columba and King Brude of the Picts. The Goddesses of Death and the Underworld are again prominent here, in thetranscendent sense, as with Persephone, but one also remembers Mithras and theWorld Bull or Minotaur of Theseus. One can imagine the presence of the BethelStone, as the Perrone of the Ankh, in the midst of the Necromanitons (a variantof the Druidic grove of the Nemeton in Galatia, relating to Nemesis or Justice,the Tau or Fate), such as that built in Greece at Ephyranus. It had buried atits core a subterranean cell for the rites which invoked the dead from Hades. When thinking of Greece and Galatia, it must be remembered that these wereoriginally under Scythian (Sidhean-Aryan) overlordship, manifesting Draconianculture and subject to Druidic law. These influences also helped to shape theHindu, Sumerian, Egyptian and Judaic traditions, beliefs and iconographies. Itis therefore understandable that we find many themes and symbols which theseseemingly disparate cultures hold in common. Within all these crosses and figures are held layers of meaning that can beinterpreted to represent a close knit variety of rites or anatomical attributeswithin the strict parameters of their genre. Consequently, to settle for onesimple explanation for any given glyph is simplistic and at variance with theintentions of the Dragon Culture which invented them. The upturned crescent moon features in the following figures. This should beremembered in relation to the galley or moon barque, which, accompanied by thelion, is a prominent badge of the Scottish clans and features in the heraldry ofLeith, near Edinburgh, where the ship carries the figure of the “Virgin Mary”(Magdalene), another Ankh variant. The Moon Boat is also said to be the originof the Genesis Ark and with the symbol of the Templars’ Anchor, the crescentmoon becomes the hull of the boat which carries the Ankh as its mast and sails. The key to understanding this symbol is to refer back to the notes and rememberthat the virgin womb (the crescent or new moon), carries the Ankh, The An-Ka orPneuma. This was the secret of the Benedicta Viriditas, the Green Blessing ofthe Mouth—“The Fairy Gift” (also “the Dark Gift”, “the Thirst”, “The Hunger”) ofeternal life in this life (transcendence) and youth, the blessing of thevirility of life regardless of age. It was said of anyone “seeing the Grail”,that although their hair might turn grey, they would not age from that day forth(Eschenbach).

The Lily and the Rose “There is a Garden in her Face” There is a Garden in her FaceWhere Roses and white Lilies grow,A heavenly Paradise is that placeWherein all pleasant fruits doe flow.There cherries grow which none may buyTill “cherry ripe” themselves do cry. —Thomas Campion (1567–1620) The Dragon TreeBeing pertinent to the appreciation of the contents of the following essays, theauthor here includes a brief word on the Dragon Tree or Dragontree, which is amassive plant that grows in Persia and Gran Canaria. Its Latin name is DracaenaDraco and it belongs to the genus Lillaceae or Lily. Its resin is called Dragon's Blood and was used as a dye which the Romans calledLac. Poetically therefore “the blood of the Lily is the blood of the Dragon”,giving it special ritual significance as a tincture for ceremonial robes, and asan epithet for the branches of the bloodline, as in a popular spelling of delAcqs as Du Lac. In relation to the Greek word Derkesthai there is, in Gaelic, a reminiscentword, dergflaith, which means “red beer”. The word dergflaith is used todescribe the Otherworld drink which conveys sovereignty upon a king. It is quitepossible, therefore, given the Greco-Gaelic connections in history, that oneword has influenced the other. Derk and Derg might derive from a similar orcommon root and Flaith might be related to the Gaelic fola, which is used inrelation to the family and blood. In which case, Dergflaith actually mightoriginally have meant Dragon's Blood, being rather the blood of a Dragonprincess, conveying the Derkesthai ability. The Lily of the ValleyIn relation to the discussion herein, the following is a brief discourse on thesubject of the lily. For the purposes of this essay we will be concentrating onboth the Lilliaceae and Nymphaea Lotus varieties which are regional variants ofeach other in Dragon Lore. The former, the Iris family, include the Lily of the Valley, whilst the latterare the species known as Blue Nile Lilies. Furthermore, for the purposes ofproviding an illustrative narrative, we will concentrate here on “Hylas and theWater Nymphs”, a portrait by the pre-Raphaelite artist J. W. Waterhouse, whosedepictions of water nymphs and Grail characters are somewhat prodigious. Inalchemical lore we know that the lily represents the virginal seminal fluid ofthe vulva and the rose represents the womb blood. However the white lily of thevalley produces red berries in autumn that are reminiscent themselves of thedroplets of Virgin blood. The lily of the valley is highly toxic and can befatal—a reminder of the love that is death. The virgin vendors themselves, like Melusine et al, are often described as waternymphs or naiads and in Waterhouse's picture the naked, pale skinned,Otherworldly ladies in the woodland pond are surrounded by and are wearing intheir hair specimens of the Nymphaea Lotus, the “lily sacred to the nymphs”.Hylas (Helios—the Sun Dragon, representative of the Sephiroth of Kether or theAjna Chakra) is a crew member of the ship Argo. Captained by Jason, it had beensculling around in Scythian territorial waters looking for the Golden Fleecewhich, like the Ark of the Covenant, is a symbol of the Holy Grail. Having been at sea without a break for some time, it had been decided that, nowthat they had sailed back through the Hellespont, they would put to shore on theisland of Chios and seek for provisions and water. It fell to Hylas to wanderoff alone into the forest to look for a fresh spring. After a protractedperegrination Hylas entered in upon the scene where Waterhouse's nymphs werebathing. He is depicted crouching on the banks of the woodland pool. Here we nowsee Hylas being tempted to enter the water and avail himself of the tender butfateful embraces of these emissaries of death. Waterhouse painted his model of Hylas wearing a blue-black robe tied about witha red thread. This, the dreaded “little thread of the Cathars”, was a memorialof the Old Testament, Hebrew scapegoats, one of which had a red thread tiedabout its horns, prior to its being pushed into the scorching desert to face itsultimate death, whilst the other was sacrificed. This double ritual was enactedbecause the Jews thought that the goat sacrificed to Jehovah was insufficient totake away the sins of the people. The Goat was called Azazel, a figure who was said to have been a fallen angeland whose name has several etymologies derived from its ritual functions but whois certainly “Satan” or Samael. The red thread represented the sins of the Jews. The symbolism is simple, the Jews ultimately laid all the responsibility forpurging their sin upon Azazel/Samael, when in the first instance, the sinbelonged not to him who was their true creator, but to the usurper Jehovahalone. For this reason, as a memorial and to express their true allegiance, theCathars, the Witches and the nobles of the blood wore the red thread. The Cathars wore it as a belt about their black robes and the latter two groupswore it as a garter or “points”. In this manner, for them it also representedthe womb blood, the “Rtu” or “red-gold flow” of the virgin priestesses of theKaula Vama Marg. On the Aziluth or imperial scale of the Kabalistic Tree of Life, red and blackare the empress and emperor colours of the Sephira of Binah, the “sphere ofunderstanding”. Binah is ruled by Saturn or Chronos and its sacred plants arethe lily and the cypress, whilst its sacred animal is the bee. Cypress was usedin the Levant as an incense to celebrate weddings and mourn the departed, whilstthe lily traditionally represents virginity and death. Here we have the symbols of Enthea and the love that is death, with the beedescribing the manner of such congress. In Waterhouse's beautifully evocativepainting the nymphs are immersed in water, the element which is a Scythiansymbol of the Daleth, the door to the Otherworld, and Hylas is about to undergoa profound process of alchemical initiation. The girls, whose watery embrace is said to spell death, are the Shunnamites, thelilies or virgins who are portrayed in the Song of Solomon. In their connectionwith water, the nymphs are thus depicted as the embodiment of the wells ofliving waters. Their deathly embrace is but the death of the ego, of the willand of desire. In uniting with them, Hylas' soul will die and his mind, oncestilled, will “understand” and give way to the transcendent spirit of thecosmos. Such is the nature of this mystical process. The nymphs are priestesses of Lilith, Diana and Persephone, they representMelusine, Magdalene and the La Belle Dame Sans Merci: the Maid of Kent who wasEdward III's “Queen of the Witches”. They are the Leanaan Sidhe, the GrailMaidens who, as perfect representations of the Goddess and the Muse, are theexternalisations of man's longing for Anima. Enthea, divine union with these meremaids, is intended to facilitate theexultant union of the animus and anima. Via this external hierogamy oralchemical marriage, comes the death of the finite, isolated being, from whenceemerges as if reborn, the universal spirit, unattached, undesiring and immersedin eternal love and life. In such terms the essence and the embrace of a GrailMaiden end all desire. Hers is the embrace of death because her spirit and her energy enliven the tiredspirit of the pilgrim and her beauty and completeness, her stillness and poise,are the sum of all that the initiate might seek. Her quiet, matter-of-factacceptance needs no striving for and is not gained by worldly show. It infusesthe stillness of the journey's end into the lover who, having to achieve nothingmore to attain her transcendent love other than just to be, melts in her embraceand without barriers, melts his being into hers. Her love is then his death, beyond which is Daleth, the door to Elphame, Onenessand eternal, silent understanding. Such is the watery grave to which Hylas haswedded his fate. The story of Hylas and the water nymphs links the pineal andwomb chakras, giving a complete teaching picture of the Grail Process. The Lotus EatersIn Greek myth the lotophagi—the Lotus Eaters—to which Hylas' story is related,experienced a similar phenomenon in consuming the Nymphaea Lotus and losingtheir desire to return to homes which they had forgotten, along with all thoseemotional trinkets and fond memories which once possessed their hearts. (Homer:The Odyssey, IX-90ff) As an infusion in wine, the petals of the Nymphaea Lotus are narcotic and bringabout psychotropic effects similar to certain mystical states. In Waterhouse'spainting the nymphs are surrounded by and are wearing these flowers in theirhair. Their immersion in the lily-bedecked water implies that their “livingwaters” or seminal fluid, the “dew of their lilies”, had similar transcendent,psychotropic qualities. The wearing of the lily on the head signifies that the source of the divineessence represented by the lilies in the pool originates with the pineal glandand the “thousand-petalled lotus” of the Ajna Chakra, which energises it and theother cerebral glands. The water these Swan maidens are swimming in is the “Seaof Binah” and they are thus the daughters of understanding, Witches of thewaters of wisdom and the children of the Hive. The nymphs are here seven in number and represent the Pleiades, the Fairydaughters of the Titan Atlas who were pursued by the Boeotian Orion or Osiris inan ancient, ritualised form of the Wild Hunt. They became the seven stars of theconstellation that bears their name and which, in a superimposed arc, adorns andsuggests the Ankh-like Cross upon which Bacchus was crucified. Waterhouse's nymphs therefore were also the wild Bacchantes or Dionysic Maenadswho themselves hunted for and drank human blood in rites whose central featurewas that of union with the divine. Associated with these nymphs is theRomano-Celtic goddess Coventina (coven, covenant or union), who was depictedeither alone or as a tripartite figure, bathing in a pool, surrounded by lilies.She is pictured in the act of pouring a jug of water into the pool itself. Herother name is Dea Latis, meaning both Goddess of the Mere and also BrightShining One, which links her with the Elves. In this she shares the attributesof the cult spirit of the river wharf in Teesdale, whose name was both Verbeiaand Latis. Related to the nymphs are the Biblical Miriams or Marys, and the Tamarises whosesymbol was the Palm. This represents the Sufi Tree of Life. Theirs was also thePomegranate of Persephone, with which the Palm appears in mystical symbolism andthe pool or oases adjacent to which the sacred Palm itself grows. Miriam or Mary and Tamaris were the names of females who occupied specificdynastic offices within the Royal Dragon bloodline in Israel. In Hebrew the nameMiriam is represented by the consonants M'R'Y'M and means “bitter” (defined hereas sorrowful). From this we obtain Mary, Mari, Marie, Marion, Maryon or Marianand all these examples contain the M'R'Y or M'R'I consonant group. In thefollowing passages we will encounter the Myr syllable group relating to myrrh,which is relevant here, particularly in relation to Tamaris. From Marion we obtain the “Maid Marion” of the Robin Hood cult, whose name andtitle equate with that of the Virgin Mary (Magdalene), to whom Robin and hisband were devoted. In Egypt the name is Mery, as in Mery Ataten. The name Mary,or properly Mari, is Indo-Aryan and means several things. The component Mer, Ma or Mar means—1) a mere or pool; 2) the sea. As Mari, it isassociated with the Mori or fates and is the An or Ankhou of the Basque Witches.Mari is also Mar Righ, meaning royal pool or royal waters, where Righ definesroyalty or kingship. Where king further relates to knowing and understanding,Mary as Mar Righ becomes1) the waters of wisdom;2) Binah, the primordial sea. In Marian the syllables break down into Mari and An. Mari as we have seen meanspool, whilst An, the root of the names of many of the earliest Dragon Queens andKings, relates to the Grail and means fire or spirit, and so Marion means“chalice” or “pool of fire” which then renders the “pool of the spirit”. The sacred cups, pools, wells and fountains we have so far encountered allrelate to the womb and the vulva. In this manner Mary or Marion means “spirit inthe womb” or “womb fire”. It is in the latter instance that we have a directreference to the Tantric, Kaula ritual of enlivening or inflaming the chakra ofthe uterine region to produce the “waters of life” or, as the Song of Solomonputs it, “The Well of Living Waters”. Mary's symbol is the white lily of the valley, the fleur de lys. In relation toMary Magdalene as the Virgin Mary of Robin Hood's devotion, this is particularlyrelevant. In this cultic cycle there appears “The One Ring that rules themall”—the Draupnir or Andvarinaut—the “Gold Dripper” (or source of Rtu, thered-gold thread or flow of the Valkirie womb) that belonged to Robin's fatherAubrey or Oberon, who is Alberich or Andvari. As “The Well of Living Waters”, Mary's relationship to Jesus becomes clearer asthe child handmaiden of the Messach, the Dragon God-King. Marie is an ancientform of the word Marry, meaning to join or unite with, as in alchemicalmarriage, divine enthea, hierogamy, the sacred marriage ritual of Solomon'sSong, with which we will deal shortly. The Hebrew meaning of Miriam is “bitter”—transf. “attended by pain or suffering:grievious (OED), hence of a state: full of affliction, mournful, pitiable(1485), expressing or betokening intense grief or misery” (OED). Here we arereminded of Mr. Keats's “palely wandering knight” and nanny Melusine as LaFontaine de Soif and “the cup of sorrows”. In many Dragon and Grail stories, the maidens inhabit or frequent pools orfountains in forest gardens. Waterhouse's water-babes inhabit a forest pool.Janet March encounters the Fairy knight Tam Lin by a rose-covered well inCarterhaugh forest, in a genealogical variation of Beauty and the Beast. Solomonhas his Sheba, a well of living waters in a labyrinth garden bedecked withsacred Pomegranate trees and Melusine is the fountain and well in a garden mazein the Forez. Relating these symbolic representations of the virgin priestess-goddess withworks such as Sir Richard Burton's Perfumed Garden and Francis Israel Regardie'sGarden of Pomegranates, gives a clear picture of the forest as the pubis whichis conceptually broadened by the maze in the dell on the hill, as the entranceto the Otherworld, hidden within the mons veneris. In the Song of Solomon we encounter the pubis as a lock, which, like the well,is an old but well-known European euphemism for the vagina. In Chapter 5, verses4-5, “My beloved put his hand by the hole of the door (the “lock”), and mybowels were moved for him (contractions): I rose up to my beloved and my handsdropped with Myrrh, and my fingers with sweet smelling Myrrh upon the lock”. Whilst earlier in Chapter 4 verses 12 and 16, “A garden enclosed is my sister,my spouse, a spring shut up, a fountain sealed: A Fountain of Gardens, a Well ofLiving Waters...” Throughout the Song, Sheba, who is “black but comely” i.e. anAnnis or Persephone figure likened to Lilith, remains a virgin. Sheba wasdescribed as “the lily of the valley” and thus, as her forest garden equateswith the pubis, then the lily of her valley is the water lily in the valley ofher vulva. Naiads or mermaids are described as being semi-divine and the handmaidens of thegods. This is aside from their usual mythic, pantheistic interpretation orsymbolic representation as nature spirits, elementals or energy complexes. Sucha description applies to the era during which these stories emerged, which wasdescribed by Euhemerus as the age when mighty men became deified and the godswere born of flesh and blood. The Irish descriptions of their “gods”, the Tuadha D'Anu, mix the qualities ofdivinity with some very human sounding foibles, whilst the descriptions of thenaiads or mermaids present us with the qualities of human femininity, butblended to a much greater extent with those of the divine. As we have seen, ashandmaids to the gods and essentially young goddesses themselves, the naiads ornixes were the Dragon Princesses of the Grail, the Ladies of the Lake, waterWitches and meremaids. They were the avatars, the Sybils who supported the elder goddess queens and godkings; they fed them, guided them to the Otherworld and, in the embrace ofdeath, empowered their beings with the integrity that gives birth to vision andwisdom. That is, the wholeness that is sovereignty over self, and consequentlysovereignty over all things. Such a condition releases creativity, but such a quality is not a product ofordinary human thinking. Rather it is a phenomenon which lies beyond thought andbeyond the capability of mundane knowledge to encapsulate or describe, both ofwhich are processes bound by time and limited by definition. It is the stillmind in union with the infinite, or, more precisely, that which knows nodistinction between it and the infinite, and that which becomes truly fertileand creative. Such was the nature of true sovereignty, the state of mind that, in kingship,affected the people and the land through good management and foresightedhusbanding. If the king was of the tinker or warrior variety, then he was byvirtue of his birth and cerebral physiological capacity, barren and infertile,and incapable of transcending his nature. In consequence, the land and peoplesuffered by virtue of their having a king who was no king at all. "},{"pageContent":"[images/00015.jpg] Chapter 11 The Rose of Sharai (Sharon) and the Song of Solomon Sharon is a level fertile plain between Jaffa and Mount Carmel in Israel. InHebrew the name derives from Sharai, a princess, from whence are derived Saraiand Sarah, which again were ritual offices in Judaism. With regard to the word rose, some dispute exists over exactly what that means.Authorities on the subject describe it as i) a crocus. ii) a polyanthus. iii) anarcissus. iv) a cistus. However, if you consult a gardening encyclopaedia youwill find that the rose of Sharon is described as the hypericum or St. John'sWort which, interestingly enough, produces a red dye and is related to thecistus. It is likely that in order to be described as a rose in the European translationof the Jewish bible, it would have had to have looked something like a rose. Inkeeping with such an identification the cistus comes quite close in its foliateresemblance to the western red and white Plantagenet rose, which we foundgrowing unabated around Janet March's well in Carterhaugh Forest. Furthermore,the cistus is called the Rock Rose in southern Europe and north Africa. The cistus is white with deep, blood red blotches, like the dappling ofmenstrual blood. The cistus belongs to the family cistacea and is also known asthe gum cistus, whose botanical genus is ladanifer from which is obtainedlaudanum. This is the dream-bestowing prize of poets and visionaries acrossEurope and the Middle-East, including Thomas de Quincy who, having taken it,were transported into the darkest, most terrifying realms of the Underworld orthe highest reaches of Heaven, both being the deepest recesses of their ownpsyches. Sheba, as the Lily of the (Nile) Valley, the nymphaea lotus and the rose ofSharon: the ladanifer, was likened to a living, narcotic pharmacopoeia. Asneither of these plants grows in Northern Europe, we have contented ourselveswith the nearest familiar symbols, those being the virginal Fleur de Lys and thePlantagenet or English Rose. The Rose represents therefore the magical menstrual flow of Solomon's beloved,whilst the name Sharon or Sarah means princess. The Rose of Sharon is thereforethe Royal Blood, the Sang Real; and the San Graal, the Holy Blood of the HolyGrail or rosi-crucis. As the Latin Ros-Sara or rosary which is devoted to theVirgin Mary, the pure white Lily, is itself the “dew of the princess”. (OED) The word Rose in Germanic means Horse, from Hros, a deity who is identifiablewith the goddesses Rhiannon and Epona, who were symbolised by the white mare andimmortalised in chalk hill carvings across Britain. By a lucky stroke of fate, or under the power of “the single poetic theme”, asRobert Graves would have it, the Hros, like Slepnir (Yggdrasil), Rhiannon, Epona(and the Hindu Breghi Moru) was a goddess who conducted the King to theOtherworld and to the goal of sovereignty. This was exactly the job of Sheba, the Rose of Sharon, and all the other waterynymphettes in history. So the Rose of Sharon, whilst referring to the flower ofthe royal menses, also refers to the function of that fluid as a method oftransport to the Otherworld. Again, death is implied by Hros because Epona and Rhiannon—but especiallySlepnir—are symbols of the white-draped funeral byre carried by four men who,like Slepnir, have eight legs. Slepnir, the white horse of Odi, is Rhiannon, the Elven mount of the Welsh Arawnor Death, the Grim Reaper (who, like Jesus,* “brings a sword to separate thequick from the dead”), scythes the spirit from the flesh. Arawn, Lord of Annwn,in the story of Pwyll Lord of Dyfed, leads a pack of red-eared, red-eyed houndsin the hunt for the red-eyed white hind. She is the virgin, Elven princess who,as in the stories of Odin or Hearne the Hunter and the Wild Hunt for Elf womenat Samhain, is the source of truth. *The image of Jesus as the Grim Reaper or Repha'im is consistent with his culticrole in the Egyptian mysteries. Significantly the verse that this passage istaken from refers to Jesus as coming with a sword, the spirit or Torah, toseparate the “quick”—the divine, immortal spirit, from the dead— the materialsoul or “dead flesh” of the unregenerate mind created from the “flesh” of mortalexperience. In vampirism the process of awakening the cerebral centres is called“the quickening”. In Indian love poetry the vulva has been referred to as “the footprint of thedeer” and we may equate both the Hind and the Hros respectively with thephysical and spiritual aspects of the Virgin. The Hart, or properly the Hind inthe thicket, so beloved of Graves, is the poetic truth hidden by the pubis, likethe tangle of thorns that hides the castle, the enclosed fastness of theprincess's virginity in Sleeping Beauty. Rapunzel's tower, her inaccessibility, is likewise a symbol of the princess'svirginity. The hounds of Arawn, Odin and Hearne, consistently in all thesestories, represent the retinue of Elf nobles who, in later times, were mimickedin the Wild Hunt by the race of the rustic youths around the maze for the virginprize at its centre. Card 13 of the Major Arcana of the Rider-Waite Tarot is entitled “Death”. 13 isthe number of the Moon and specifically of the menstrual cycle. Riding Epona orSlepnir, the red-eyed white horse of elphame, the skeletal figure of the GrimReaper rides across the field of life in a black cloak and full armour,trampling the noble and the humble alike under his horse's hooves. In his handhe carries the banner of the white rose of the spirit on a black field. However,this is not a funerary plant. The white rose, like the red rose, symbolises love, but which in this case isphilea rather than eros. The horse's reins and livery are black and adorned withskulls and crossbones, which we understand to be representations of the Baphometor Holy Grail. Behind him in the distance lie the twin towers that feature inanother major Arcana card—“The Moon”. Beyond the towers the sun is shining abovethe dark horizon. The towers, the horns of the Sabbatical Goat, represent the open legs of thepriestess-goddess and the glow of the sun. As in the case of the Hallowe'encandle on the seesaw, or the candle between the goat's horns, it is the glow ofthe red-gold of the virgin menses and the Chakra or Sephiroth of the womb. Thissymbol is replicated in the second card, “The High Priestess”, dealt withearlier. This again is a card of “the love that brings death” and the Reaper symbolises,not physical mortality, but the victory of transcendence over mortal pomp andmaterialism and the life-that-is-death. In such a context therefore—Death asInitiation—the white rose of the spirit and pure love, is identical with the redrose of Sharon, inasmuch as the red rose does not herein symbolise sexualpassion. It represents the menses-smeared rose of the vagina's foliate aperture,contact with which brings the spiritual purity symbolised by the pale flower ofDeath's banner. Like doves, roses are sacred to Venus who as Ishtar and Lucifer, the “bright andmorning star” is the bringer of light and enlightenment. Venus' emerald jewel,the hermetic tablet of destiny (also the Lia Fail of the Scythians), is calledthe jewel in Satan's crown. When it “falls” or is reversed, it becomes thehidden “cubic stone”, the dark, oozing monolith of the hidden Grail, concealedin the recesses of the body of the Swan Princess, the naiad, from whom one mightobtain “blood out of a stone”. The reversed emerald tablet, the cubic stone darkened by its concealment, is thesubject of two 15th-century paintings—“Livre du Coeur D'Amours Epris” and“Melusine by the Fountain”. In both these paintings, the image of a black marbleblock from whence flows a curious fluid, is repeated. In French legendMelusine's well and fountain are the source of both joy and sorrow, much likethe Croix de Lorraine. This sentiment is repeated in Livre Du Coeur D'Amours Epris, which warns thatmisfortune will befall him who drinks from the water that issues from beneaththe stone. The knight in the picture, as in all stories connected with Venus'Jewel, is further warned not to pour water over the stone itself. Such would constitute Christian baptism, which was viewed by the Bloodline as adefilement, and a debasement of their pure spirits by an invasive and hostilealien culture. As with Melusine's black stone, the one depicted in “Livre”engenders the “Heart's longing for Lady Grace”. Consequently, like Melusine's,it is a fountain of thirst because after one taste of its “waters” the ego'slonging for material peace or security ceases. However, it is then replaced bythe spirit's longing for enthea, its westward journey home to the love that isdeath. The Song of SolomonThe authorship of the Song of Songs is attributed to King Solomon, probablybecause the subject matter dealt with has an underlying Hermetic, esotericcharacter which accords with what is known of Solomon's ritual practices. Less probable is the reason that he originally compiled it in its entirety.Nevertheless it is quite possible that he wrote certain aspects of the songwhich perhaps were added to later by subsequent poets or scribes. The overallsyntax of the manuscript form of the Song of Songs, compiled circa 450-400 BC,is Aramaic and was deposited in the School of the Temple of Solomon inJerusalem. The original piece is said to have derived from early oral sources and belongsto the genre of ancient Egyptian love poetry. The song also bears a strikingresemblance, from a secular point of view, to Near Eastern love poems. The Temple School was probably destroyed and its teachers dispersed during thedestruction of Jerusalem by the Romans. A number of Christian nobles were saidto have fled Palestine at that time which led, it is further attested, to theintroduction of vampirism into Central Europe. This isn't strictly true, but anew wave or variation of the cult could have been reintroduced then. It is alsovery likely that many kabalists and rabbis also fled and settled in less hostiledistricts in Europe following the destruction of the Temple. In this way could be explained the appearance of “Solomon Schools” in placeslike Hermannstadt, Toledo and Carpathia, which one assumes were outposts orexiled cells of the original Temple of Solomon School in Israel. It was from one of these institutions, renowned for alchemy, kabala and Hermeticlore that Dracula was said to have “ridden the Dragon”, meaning that he was theprincipal graduate. Following this illustrious academic career, Dracula, whoclaimed to have derived his name from his apostolic priesthood of the Egyptiancult of Draco, embarked on a reign that was marked by his overt practice ofvampirism. Solomon was what some might call a pagan and a great deal of Fairy lore and manygods from Eurasia filtered into and influenced Jewish culture during Solomon'sreign. The Christian Bible tends to blame this state of affairs largely onSolomon's choice of wives, who were said to have brought these strangeabominations with them. This explanation doesn't, however, take into account thefact that Solomon himself was deeply committed to and involved with Hermeticsciences and dark magic. Solomon had, as wives, 700 royal princesses gathered from all over the NearEast. In addition to these he had a further 300 concubines and these comprisedhis Harem. A rather excessive and self-indulgent amount of women, simply for thepurposes of providing one man with a variety of copulatory partners. We are then obliged by our own curiosity to ask why Solomon kept so many femalesaround at such a large cost. If we take another look at the word herem we willfind the answer. From the OED we learn that the English word “Harem” is takenfrom the Arabic haram, and means a sacred or prohibited place. The term “sacred” could only be attributed if the “haram”, the building, or moreappropriately the institution within the building, were in some way spiritual orreligious. According to the Oxford Companion to the Bible the word “harem” has acognate in the Hebrew “herem”, which is translated into the English “ban”.Specifically, the herem or Harem, as a ban, was something set apart for culticuse, to be used only by priests, and thus a Harem is understood to be spiritualand holy, not simply a royal bordello or an amusement arcade. Such a reflection brings into question the actual purpose of Arabic and NearEastern herems in general, particularly in light of the fact that, in Arabicmysticism, the Sufic “Tree of Life” is a Tamaris or Palm tree, beloved of thePhoenix. Its leaves comprise of the many-eyed tail feathers of the Yedzidicpeacock god of Mesopotamia—Shaitan, who was worshipped in rituals of blood. “He feedeth amongst the lilies”, Song of Solomon, Chapter II, verse 16: Shebaenjoins Solomon to feed amongst the lilies until the break of day, like a younghart on the mountains of Bether. A lily is a virgin and thus Solomon by nightfeeds amongst the Virgins, the virgin princesses of his “Harem”. The medieval kabalists proposed a sacred code as a key to translating thehermetic secrets of the Song or “Canticle of Canticles” as it was also known. Atthe same time, some commentators have asserted that the work was derived from(Egyptian) cultic origins and was part of a rite of sacred marriage, a fertilityceremony and a ritual to ward off death. (James M. Reese) These three components together adequately describe, in its entirety, theorganic-alchemical rite of vampirism. This is itself a sacred marriage, a unionof enthea, intended to open the mind to creativity and transcendent perceptions,thus stimulating spiritual fertility and increasing longevity, or warding offdeath. The Song of Solomon is a blood rite, a communion where the wine, the blood, ofthe virgin goddess is drunk. This rite remained in the House of Daviduntil thetime of Jesus ben Panther, when he reinstated it as an exoteric ritual for hisdisciples. Solomon's harem was a blood farm and the females in it were there tofeed him, to increase his wisdom and lengthen his life. Sheba seems to have been the first lady amongst many and throughout thediscourse she continues, like them, to retain her virginity. In taking a closerview of the evidence we will inspect the following passages. Chapter II verses16-17; Chapter IV verses 12-13; Chapter IV verse 15; Chapter V verse 5; ChapterVII verse 9 and Chapter VIII verse 2. Chapter II verse 16: “My beloved is mine and I am his, he feedeth amongst thelilies”. Verse 17: “Until the day break and the shadows flee away, turn, mybeloved, and be thou like a roe or a young hart upon the mountains of Bether”.As we have seen, feeding amongst the lilies is feeding from the blood and waterof the young virgin brides. The hart on the mountain symbolises the young king in his glory and the medievalsymbol of the young stag drinking from the Grail is directly related to theseverses. Chapter IV verse 12, “A garden enclosed is my sister, a spring shut upand a fountain sealed”. Sheba is a virgin throughout the Song and her maidenly attributes attractvarious epithets. In this verse we find the three main Grail symbols associatedwith the priestess: the garden, the well and the fountain. Here these are enclosed and sealed indicating Sheba's maidenhood and herguardianship of an “underground” (hidden) stream or source of arcane vitalityexpanded upon in the next verses. Chapter IV verse 13, “Thy plants are anorchard of pomegranates (Grove: cf. Avalon) with pleasant fruits; camphire andspikenard”. Whilst the Indian spikenard (spica narda) was used by Mary Magdalene to anointJesus, the pomegranate is a standard symbol of the virgin vulva and womb, andSheba's garden of pomegranates has in its midst: Chapter IV verse 15: “A fountain of gardens, a well of living waters...” whichcause those who are asleep to speak as we shall see. The living waters in otherscriptural references are related to the Holy Spirit, as is fire. Water as weremember was the element through or over which one travelled to Elphame inCeltic lore. Elphame here equates with the Underworld or Otherworld, the Kingdom of Heaven orSamadhi, and the living waters contain in their droplets the secret of eternalwisdom and the gift of transcendent awareness, god consciousness. The HolySpirit, the Shekinah, is of the feminine gender and a female gift therefore. In alchemy blood and semen are the primae materia or first matter of the greatwork. Sadly however, many think that only men have semen (an ignorance of femaleanatomy and physiology that has caused a great loss to our womenfolk). In factwomen also have it, and this semen, from the well of living waters, is whatalchemical texts are actually referring to. Those who are familiar with the Templar story concerning their Lord of Sidon,will recollect the skull which comprises the skull and crossbones motif. This isbecause the symbol of the Baphomet—the Holy Grail—is derived from the skullwhich was placed between the thigh bones of the Templar's dead wife, butting upagainst where her vagina once was, nine months after an act of knightlynecrophilia. The wife's name in the story was Yse de Maraclea or Isis (of theclear waters: Mara-Clair). The skull, the Templar's “son”, represents ancientwisdom from beyond the grave. In its positioning between the woman's thighs, itindicates that such wisdom is obtained by uniting in hierogamy with one of theGoddess-Queens of the death cult of Ankou—Isis. Such a union, similar to that expounded by the Scythians in relation to Epona orRhiannon, results in the birth of the Templar's son: the skull; the wisdom frombeyond the mortal realm. This wisdom is directly related to the feminineprinciple, hence the proximity of the skull to the vulva, denoting theinterconnection between the pineal gland and the womb, the well of livingwaters. Chapter V verses 4-5: “ My beloved put in his hands by the hole of the door andmy bowels were moved for him”. Verse 5: “I rose up to open to my beloved; and myhands dropped (dripped) with Myrrh, and my fingers with sweet smelling Myrrh(vaginal mucus), upon the handles of the lock”. The hole of the door is the keyhole, the opening of the vagina, whilst thehandles of the lock are the labia. The door itself is daleth or delta : the doorto the mysteries and the triangle of the “all seeing eye of god” (that looksinto the darkness) which in Hebrew is called Ayin or “The Devil”, whose numberis the same as the numerical rank of Ishtar or Venus in the assembly of theAnunnaki gods—15. In verse 4, the beloved manipulates the maiden and her “bowels” (a common wordused in classical literature which referred to the deeper internal organs, notjust the intestines) are moved for him. In other words she orgasms, her wombcontracts and in so doing she rises and opens her vulva for him to drink theblood or seminal fluid discharged by the spasm. In references to the Fisher King, it is said that he drank the contents of theGrail through a golden straw. Very importantly, when thinking of theconstruction of this device, we should remind ourselves of the shape of both theAnkh Cross and the Crux Ansata. Such a device would have been inserted into thevirgin's urethra to the depth of about one inch. The partner in the riteinserted his or her finger into the vagina and massaged the “roof of the mouth”or the uppermost wall of the channel nearest the opening or “mouth” of thevagina, behind the pubic bone. After a few conducive minutes perhaps, orgasm would occur and the fluid from thegland would discharge itself through the straw, either into the waiting mouth ofthe recipient, or into a “Grail Platter” or dish held next to the vulva. In onepublication the dish and the straw were confused with surgical instruments thatthe author thought were used for castration. This is not the case. The symbol ofthe Grail as a Dish is related to its use as a collector of blood or femaleejaculate and is sometimes symbolised by the crescent moon (see above). If we read Chapter V verse 5 literally, the maiden has been asleep with herhands in the spice jar and her fingers are covered with myrrh oil as a result.She then hears her lover at the door and, rather than noticing her mistake andwiping her hands, she goes straight away to open the door and covers the handlein grease. Such an interpretation makes no sense whatsoever. If she had been asleep withher hands (plural) in the ointment, she must have either been a contortionist ora devotee of an odd form of nocturnal skin care therapy. In any case, if it werenot a pertinent symbolic aspect of the narrative, there would be nojustification in mentioning it. Therefore by its very inclusion in the text, weare obliged to look for a meaning that transcends the literal interpretation. Myrrh (Latin: myrrha. Greek: murra) is a gum resin produced from several speciesof the commiphora balsamodendron, also known as commiphora myrrha. The oil ofmyrrh is produced from the seed which is known as myrospermum pubescens, and theetymological link here to female ejaculate should be meditated upon. Myrrh orthe “myrrh tree” is also a name for the plant called sweet cicely or myrrhusodorata (related to chervil), but as a name it is further applied to any treeproducing this type of resin. We should bear this in mind as we look at myrrh as a word in itself. Althoughthe Latin species classifications are late, deriving from Linnaeus, in manyinstances the original names from whence they came are Greek. We notice that theword myrrh begins with the letters myr and there is a group of plants andsubstances whose names begin with this syllable that are relevant to thisdiscourse. Firstly we encounter the plant tamariscus and remember the nameTamaris, which was applied to princesses of the House of David. Tamariscus or tamarix grows in sandy conditions in west Asia and is known by theLatin name myrica, a name which also applies to the bog myrtle: myrica gale. TheMyrtle Tree is found in a medieval Italian story about a Fairy lover who is thespirit of the plant. This lends itself to the idea that the story was extractedfrom far earlier sources, and that the Tamaris Princess was the original “Fairylover” or, in Gaelic, the Anam Cara or Leanaan Sidhe. Myrica-tallow or myricawax are produced from myrtle trees, whilst the substance myricin is theinsoluble component in the wax that bees produce to construct HIVES. In the Tudor song “The Nut Tree” the tree in question will only bear a silvernutmeg and a golden pear. The nutmeg is known by its Latin name as myristica,from the Greek word—murizein, meaning “anoint”. Nutmeg contains the chemicals which, when refined are known as MDMA or“Ecstasy”. In trials conducted on the Nile Lily or nymphacaea lotus, the plantproduced similar euphoric, but less strident effects to those experienced byusers of MDMA. Nutmeg produces an oil containing this drug, and the associationwith anointing and the Christos is quite telling. The golden pear on the “NutTree” is a pomegranate which was often called by the former epithet. In Old French, pomegranate was spelt pome grenat, meaning “apple of many seeds”from the Latin malum granatum, and here we return to the Avalon connection andthe pomegranate as the original, perhaps of the later regional and literaryvariation—the Druidic and Edenic apple trees. The pomegranate belongs to thefamily myrtaceae, whilst its partner on the legendary “Nut Tree”, the nutmeg, isof the family myristica fragrans, the “musk smelling nut”. Musk is a name givento any group of scents which are produced by the sex glands and used as sexualattractants. Returning to the Song of Songs we now find that the pomegranates and myrrh inthe narrative are related via Myr, to a whole series of plants and substanceswithin grail lore which are associated with the Sephiroth, with psychotropicstates and with the sex organs. Perhaps the myrrh of the Song of Songs is theoil of the “Musk Smelling Nut”, the ejaculate, which then becomes associatedwith the sweet wine of the pomegranate, the menses, thus forming the partnershipbetween the rose of Sharon and the lily of the valley. Again we are reminded here of the Irish story of the blood red nut that fellevery 28 days into the Well of Nechtan (the pure one), to be consumed by thesalmon of wisdom—the Ichthys of the New Testament. From there we travel back tothe Orchard of Pomegranates in the garden of the Well of living waters. In Chapter VIII verse 2: Sheba says to Solomon “ I would lead thee and bringthee into my mother's house, who would instruct me; I would cause thee to drinkof spiced wine (nutmeg?) of the juice of my pomegranate”. Notice “my” and the singular pomegranate, as opposed to the fruits plural. Sheis not inviting him in for drinks and she is not referring to a beverage here,but the blood and mumae of her vulva. Pomegranate flowers, seed cells and juiceare red, like blood. In Chapter VII verse 9: “And the roof of thy mouth like the best wine for mybeloved, that goeth down sweetly, causing the lips of those that are asleep tospeak”. The euphemistic “roof of the mouth” is the region by the opening or“mouth” of the vagina. It is behind the pubic bone, where the semenal duct islocated which secretes ejaculate through the urethra. The chemicals in thesesecretions increase perception and wisdom, enabling those who were “asleep”,meaning unregenerate or untranscended, to speak with the words of the quickenedor resurrected Spirit. Sheba, the rose of Sharon and the lily of the valley, describes herself as blackbut comely. In so doing she has initiated a tradition where many scholars downthe centuries have confidently stated that she was from Sheba in Ethiopia. However, the constant, relentless reference to “my sister, my bride”, whateveranyone says about terms of endearment in Biblical times, indicates that Shebawas the daughter of Bathsheba and as a consequence, the sister of Solomon. Thisis hardly surprising as he descended from a pharaonic bloodline wherebrother-sister marriages were de rigueur. The reference to her being black relates to her other epithets as ShebaLilithand Sheba-Venus or Ishtar (Inanna), which associate her with her ancient Dragonancestry and to her forebears Lilith (Diana), Inanna, Kali Azura, and Hecate.Her other forebear, Black Annis, like Sheba, is associated herself with wellsand labyrinths, and who was a principal figure of veneration in the Cult ofAnkou. Solomon, conversely, is described as having skin as white as marble. Inexoteric, uninitiated and therefore “best-guessed” Vampire lore, it is said thatsuch a complexion is equated with their being bloodless. Nothing could befarther from the truth. Recent laboratory tests confirm the ancient innertradition by showing that any animal injected with large amounts of melatoninturns paler in colour. Solomon's complexion, like that of the Vampire of legend,is as white as marble because, like they, he fed constantly from melatonin-richroyal, female virgin blood. A lot of the additional etymological associations here are retrospective andpoetic. Nevertheless the central theme of the story stands up to a classicalalchemical interpretation whilst the Latin and Greek word relationships add aquality of resonance to the picture. They further echo Graves' concept that theCosmos has meaning and intelligence, expressing itself through a single poetictheme of interconnected meanings, the like of which inspired the ancientHermetic Table of Magical Correspondences. George Riley-Scott (Phallic Worship) points out, and is supported in his view byother academics, that the Bible has been altered down the ages to suit theambitions of the translators of the day. This being the case we must rememberthat much of the Bible has been cleaned up and passages dealing with incest,along with various other unseemly practices, have probably been given anarrative reworking to suit the sensibilities of various pious audiences andpatrons. An example of this might be found in Chapter VIII verse 1 which says, “Oh thatthou wert as my brother, that sucked the breasts of my mother!” Wert is printedas an italic—wert, denoting a translator’s insert. Remove this and you get adifferent picture. Chapter VIII verse 5 claims that Sheba was born “Under the Apple Tree” andsuggests that she was spoken for when she had no breasts. If she were a virgin,“a wall”, says Chapter VIII verse 9, Solomon would build a palace of silver uponher, but if she were a door, he would board her up with cedar. Sheba replied bysaying that she was a wall and her breasts thenceforth were the towers of thepalace that Solomon built upon it. The edifice of Solomon's glory, the palace ofhis wisdom, was built upon the virginity of Sheba and the essence of the womb ofthe princess born under the apple tree, reminiscent of Avalon and sacred to theDruids. Let’s assume that the Song of Songs is seen as a deliberate contribution to thepoetry of the Dragon culture, which has at its centre the maiden's labyrinth,the Garden of Love. In this case, the Song of Songs begins to make sense as anHermetic, alchemical Vampire allegory of the love of the Dragon prince for hismaiden, a sacred chemical wedding which is the source of his power andsovereignty. "},{"pageContent":"[images/00053.jpg]Chapter 12 Who's Who in Heaven We turn our attention now to the weighty problem of identifying the gods. Somemistakes have been made in the past when people tried to cross match thepantheons of contemporary civilisations. For example the Egyptian goddess Hathorbecame identified with the Roman goddess Venus and so on. The mistakes are easy to make because the Goddess Hathor was, in fact,originally the Sumerian Nin-Khursag, the mother of Inanna, who is also known asthe Akkadian Ishtar, the Semitic Astaroth, the Greek Aphrodite, the Norse Frejaand finally the Roman Venus etc. As we know the positions of the gods in the various pantheons and theirattributes and relationships to each other, we can re-identify who they reallyare. Surprisingly we find that the separate pantheons of the Aryans, Sumerians,Egyptians, Greeks, Romans, Vikings and so on, all appear to be derived from avery ancient family genealogy of “gods”. These gods furthermore seem to stemfrom the early Sumerian pantheon. However, recent research confirms that the original Sumerians were descendedfrom the Ubaid, a proto-Aryan, Pictish culture which originated in the regionencompassing Carpathia, Transylvania and the White Mountains where the Greekgods originated, which later became known as Scythia. It is suggested therefore that the Sumerian gods (the ancient deific royalfamily) were imported with the Ubaid Picts from Transylvania, Carpathia andScythia. Scholars relate that the name Sumer is pronounced Shumer, the sh for s,indicating a linguistic relationship with early Goidelic. Thus it is closelyrelated by pronunciation to the Gaelic Sumaire, meaning, as we know, a Vampireand a “reptile”—a Dragon. Reminiscent of the racial term “Gallic” (Gaelic), the word GALL in Sumerianmeans “navigator” (nautonnier) and implies guardianship and overlordship. InBarker's theory of Cybernetics, (management systems), the entity or mechanismcontrolling any system, be it social or mechanical, must operate at atechnologically (or genetically) higher frequency or capacity than the systemthat it controls, otherwise chaos will ensue and the system will spin out ofcontrol. This guiding entity or facility, is termed in cybernetics thenautonnier or navigator. Gaelic is the language of the Nautonniers, stated by many scholars to be, in anearly form, a precursive language of the Aryans. In this language the dialecticu is pronounced i when it follows a consonant at the beginning of a word, and sothe first syllable of both Sumaire and Sumer would then have been pronouncedShee, directly related to Sidhe and the Sidheans or Scythians. Both would thenbe pronounced the same—Sheemar. And indeed evidence for just such a case lands in our laps from the pages of theBible's Book of Genesis, where it states that “the cities of Babylon, Akkad andErech are in the land of Shin'Ar”. Shin'Ar is Sumeria and so our Sheepronunciation finds credence in the very word of God itself! Furthermore, if welook at Shin'Ar with “our Vampire eyes” (apologies to Anne Rice) and rememberthe Ubaid origin of Sumerian and hence, via Akkadian, the “Gaelic” origin ofHebrew as well, we will see Shin as Sidhean and Ar as Arya. Sidhean was the nameof King Elinus of Albany in the 7th century AD. His full name was Gille Sidhean(Jille-She'en), meaning Steward of the Fey. Sidhean was pronounced with the dh remaining dialectically silent as it sometimes does in Sidhe or Shee, giving usSheen for Sidhean. The Ar component can be found in Takla Makan. Here it forms part of the phraseArshi Cantu or Arya-Sidhe Canto (Tocharian “A”), the devotional, “power-wisdom”language of the Aryan Scythian inhabitants of western China (Aryan Sanskrit:China [soft ch—as in the French word—chat] or Shin'Ar!) who were named theTocharians. It would appear then that the “Ar-shi” phrase used by the easternScythian-Aryans to describe their spiritual language is reversed and repeated inthe Hebrew name Shin'Ar, or Sidhean-Arya. And what does Shin'Ar mean? Exactlythe same as it means in Sumerian—SU.ME.—Lord of the Powers. In addition the Sumerian SI means righteous, pertaining to a god (related to theGothic—guth [and hence the Goths and the Godthi Druids of the Danes]—one who haspower over the fate or destiny of others, a Fairy). SHU in Sumerian meansSupreme, also used in relation to the gods so SHU.MER would, in any case, meanSupreme Lords, which is the same as Power Lords (Arya-Sidhe), whilst the wordsupreme is related to Uber and therefore denotes a Vampire and an Overlord—aGuardian. If the m in either Sumer or Sumaire was originally intended to be mh, then bothSumer and Sumaire would have been pronounced Shiva or Sidha, both of which areconnected with the Elves, the Aryan god “Siva the Destroyer” and the siddhis—thepowers. Sumer is thought to mean “land of the guardians”. A guardian—a“Watcher”—is an overseer, and from this meaning we obtain the Scythian worduber, meaning a Vampire or Overlord (by association, we also obtain from“watcher” the word Nefilim, which relates to the Anunnagi or Anunnaki). Here we remember again the proto-Sumerian Ubaid Pictish culture which migratedin about 5000 BC from Scythian Carpathia, a land which had a Dragon Culture alsoas early as 5000 BC. Monumental stone carvings of winged serpents from this datehave been found in Transylvania, along with a “proto”-Sumerian script datingback as far as 8000 BC. The figures incorporated on the clay tablets found atTartaria in Transylvania are almost identical with Sanskrit and early Egyptianpictograms. Tantalisingly, the Goidelic mh couplet is exactly the same as the Goidelic bh,both of which are pronounced v. It isn't fantastical to suggest that both bh andmh lost their h's and have been substituted and re-substituted arbitrarily, onefor the other over the course of the centuries. It has happened everywhere else,why not here? Further, the mer and maire syllables in Sumer and Sumaire arerelated in the Sumerian Me and the Gaelic Mor. In Sumerian, ME means Lord or Master (an Overseer or Overlord). In Gaelic Mormeans “high” (also related to mountain and thus “dweller on the mountain”; onewho soars to the heights—a Druid or Merlin). It is used as a suffix to the namesof Scotic chieftains or kings as in—The Conor Mor—the High King (or Overlord) ofthe Clan Conor, for example. If Sumer means guardian and thus overlord, then so does sumaire and the SUcomponent thus means “the Power”—the Sidhe or Siddhi. ME is also, it seems,specifically related to wisdom and knowledge (the Aryas) and in both senses,therefore, the “sumer” or “sumaire”, being one and the same thing— is aDerkesthai, a Dragon—a fact born out by every other piece of evidence you mightcare to mention. Sumer and Sumaire mean therefore—Lord of the Powers—SU.ME. The Ubaid culture was named after the place where in 1919, H.R. Hall discoveredthe ruins of an ancient settlement. Since then, archaeologists made significantfinds of blue-spiralled or labyrinthine decorated pottery and, up to the late1960's, stone tools had also been found. This “Ubaid” people who had been “cast down” (Nefilim) from their lofty abodesin the mountains of the North, fleeing south to Sumeria in about 5000 BC are nowconsidered by academics to be the founders of Sumerian civilisation. Accordingto Zechariah Sitchin, in 1852 the Reverend Charles Foster (The One PrimevalLanguage) proved that all languages, including early Chinese and other FarEastern languages, stemmed from one primeval source—thereafter shown to beSumerian. This is palpably untrue, as we now know, as the Ubaidbrought Sumeriancivilisation and its language to Mesopotamia. They were early “proto”Scythian-Aryan migrants who fled the Black Sea region at the onset of the firstFlood. It follows therefore that all languages stemmed, not from Sumerian, but from the“proto-Sumerian” language of the early Scythian-Aryan Homelands, examples ofwhich we know were discovered in Tartaria in Transylvania. This language, called by most scholars “proto Indo-European” (and I wish theywouldn't), was called Gaelic by Canon Beck and other respected academics whowere contemporaries of Charles Foster. The Very Reverend Beck quipped that thisAryan Tongue, the mother of modern Irish, was the language of the Garden ofEden. Proto Indo-European is thought to come from an earlier group calledDene-Caucasian, which tends to stress Canon Beck's point even more. Recent archaeological discoveries prove that there is many a true word spoken injest! The present and seemingly vast differences in the varied languages thatdeveloped from “Gaelic” can be explained by one phrase— ChronologicallyDiversified Dialectics. In the last four hundred years, the English language has changed so much thatthe majority of the resident British population would not be able to readChaucer in the original script. Imagine what happens to a language over, forexample, one millennium and several thousand miles. From northern Mesopotamia to the foothills of Zagros, archaeologists working inthe area from the 1970's onwards have ascertained that the Ubaid people hadbuilt cities which were the first to use: clay bricks (cf: the Aryan,Mohenjo-Daro and Harrapo settlements of the Indus Valley: 2300 BC, which werecontrolled by Sumeria), plastered walls, mosaic decorations, cemeteries withbrick-lined graves, copper mirrors, beads with imported turquoise, copper-headedtomahawks, cloth, houses, and above all, monumental temple buildings. However, south in Eridu—the first truly Sumerian city according to the ancienttexts—nothing could be excavated from beneath the foundations of the temple ofEnki that was any older than 3500 BC. This is clear enough evidence that theElven queens and kings of the Transylvanian Picts founded Sumeria, and the mostup-to-date academic studies and archaeological discoveries from the Departmentof Archaeology of the University of Wales corroborate this fact. In the 1990's it was revealed by academics that the Ubaid priesthood woreleopard (panther) skins (cf. Jesus ben Panther!) and tattooed themselves in asimilar fashion to the British Picts and the Tocharian “A’ryans of Takla Makan”.The pointy shamanic headdress (worn by the god-kings and queens of the Induspantheon as well), was also of Aryan origin, with or without the horns. Moving from Romania, via Anatolia to Mesopotamia, the Ubaid left a trail ofTells or Raths, wall decorations, spiral-decorated pottery and brick builtstructures. In northern Mesopotamia, which has very little workable stone, theycontinued to use clay and plaster, whilst in the south, where rocks areplentiful, they built the Ziggurats or sacred mountains that reminded them ofthe holy peaks of their Carpathian homelands. When the Sumerians took over Maganor Egypt, their Ziggurats became Pyramids. In very little time at all after their arrival in Mesopotamia they had found andwere working copper—centuries before other people's bronze ages. Their chiefgod-king Enki had been an adept at mining (earning him the epithet “The Lord ofMining”—Bel Nimiki) and had, according to the later Sumerian texts, inventedbrickmaking, the planning and building of cities and metallurgy, which earnedhim the name Nidimmud—“He who makes things”. His Fairy descendants since then have all earned epithets associated with minesand alchemy, such as Dwarves, Goblins, Kobelins, Trolls, Gnomes, etc., and, asin the case of the Tuadha d'Anu, they have always been renowned for their skillin many crafts and arts. The place was called Al'Ubaid and was located justnorth of Ur, or Eridu as it was once called. The article Al in Al'Ubaid denotesthat the location was named “of the Ubaids”. Rather than the culture merelybeing named after its site of discovery, the actual site itself was named afterthe Ubaids in the first place, who had migrated south via Anatolia and Galatia,from whence we originally derived the word Vampire—the Uber. Although the meanings are self evident and the implications thereof are quiteplain, it might be educative to meditate on the further implications of Sumerspelt Subher in connection with the Scythian (Ubaid) uber and the possiblecommon European migration of the consonants b and p, which give rise to our wordsuper—as in supervisor—a guardian or overlord—an Ubaid. From the above, we can conclude that the so-called Sumerian gods, repeatedlysymbolised by serpents or Dragons, are an Aryan-Scythian import of the earlierUbaid settlers whose gods were the Dragons incarnate themselves—the Uber orVampire queens and kings—the Ubaid Overlords. The overseer or one who sees overor “beyond” is one who sees above others and one who thus sees clearly. One whosees clearly is a Derkesthai, a Dragon. It seems fairly conclusive that these serpent gods were later referred to by theSumerian people themselves as the Anunnagi from whence is derived naga, aserpent or Dragon god of the Vedas. That the Nagas themselves were Devas—meaningshining ones—repeating the meaning of the name Anunnagi as shining ones(shimmerers—Sumerers) squeezes one into a corner. Archaeological discoveries in the 1960's of what was to become known as“proto-Sumerian” script, dug up from ash pits in Transylvania, should becompared with Tartarian traditions there. They assert that Lilith and herbrother were born in Transylvania as a result of a mating between the“Keshalyi”, the queen of the mountain Fairies, and the “Locolico”, the king ofthe dwellers of the underworld mounds, situated in the forests and plains. Thisis echoed in the marriage of Nergal (Nagal—Naga) of the underworld and EreshKigal, a netherworld goddess in whom one can see the prototype of Persephone. Aswith all ancient tales, the plot becomes confused but by looking at comparablestories, some light can be shed on the truth. Eresh Kigal was not a lady or queen of the mountains, but Ninkhursag hergrandmother, was. It is interesting to see how the identity of the grandmotherfiltered down to the granddaughter, however. This indicates that the myth of theregion once included all the characters who elsewhere still feature inrelationship to each other. As interesting, though, is the possibility that we might find a clue to thetriple goddess concept in the very grandmother-mother-daughter theme suggestedby the muddling of characteristics in the Transylvanian story. It is quitefeasible that triple goddesses are not solely depictions of the three stages ofwomanhood, the moon, earth or whatever identities are assigned to them, but thehalf-forgotten relationships of a holy dynasty. As I have indicated above, in Greek mythology there is a relationship betweenDemeter, Persephone, Kore and Diana-Hecate. If we transpose this series into theSumerian, we have Ninkhursag, Ningal, Eresh Kigal and Lilith as lineardescendants. In Transylvania, the Keshalyi queen becomes Eresh Kigal, and the Lilith of theTransylvanians and the Sumerians becomes the Diana-Hecate of the Greeks who, asa moon goddess, one might be tempted to turn into the Egyptian Isis. But stayyour hand I say, and read on! If we read descriptions of the “Sumerian” Lilith, taken from Hebrew sources, wediscover that she, like her Grandfather Enlil (Zeus) and her uncles Minos andRhadamanthus, and her cousin Ariadne of the labyrinth, had red hair and paleskin, and was called the Alien Queen of the North. This indicated both by hercomplexion and her stated geographical origin, that she was a proto-Aryan orproto-Scythian. So the indications are that Lilith, along with the entire holyfamily of gods, was a Ubaid import from Carpathia who later became a Sumeriangoddess. It would be fair to say therefore that if Lilith were born in the mountainousregions that stood next to where Zeus and Prometheus battled (who were alsoidentified with “Sumerian” gods), then so were her kin. It would then besimplistic to say that the gods of all the pantheons were descended from theSumerian. It is more likely that they all, including the Sumerian, originatedfrom the proto-Scythian Aryan culture. As each group migrated and their descendants settled in their respectivedomains, changes took place. They became isolated from the source of theiroriginal spiritual culture by geography, and the passing centuries. Also thenames of their gods changed because of the inevitable influence of the beliefsystems of the aboriginal cultures that the migrants either vanquished orcohabited and integrated with. In some historical comparisons of the various pantheons, and indeed in thepantheons themselves, there will have been mistakes made because there was nounderstanding or overview of the relationships between the deities. In the caseof the Vedas, as Sitchin remarks, consistency and precision are not thehallmarks of this Sanskrit literature. Such an observation holds true for muchof spiritual literature worldwide, as memory fades and the gaps are filled in tocreate myth out of history. By a comparative study of the pantheons and beliefs, we may discover aconsistent vein by which we may adjust all the pantheons, where such stem from arecognisable common source. One example is the case of the Aryan God Kasyapa. He was the father of theAsuras, the elder gods. One pantheon has him down as Dyaus Pater and identifieshim with Zeus. Zeus or Enlil was the father of the younger gods. These were theOlympians who in the Aryan pantheon are called the Adityas. Kasyapa fatheredthem, as well as the elder gods, which Zeus did not. Thus there is an anomaly which, I am pleased to report, is easily resolved whenwe learn that Kasyapa means Sky Father and so does Anu! In Sumeria the elder andyounger gods are called the offspring of Anu—hence Anunnaki—and the elder godsare led by Enki, whilst the younger gods are led by his brother Enlil. Enki'sfollowers are the Asher, corresponding to the Asura of the Aryans, the Aesir ofthe Danes and the Aes Danu—the Tuadha d'Anu of the Irish. "},{"pageContent":"[images/00041.jpg] Chapter 13 Children of the Stars Anu's father was Asher. Marduk was called Asar or Ra, the grandfather of Osiriswho himself was also called Ashur or Asar (As-Ar: “Seeing Lord”, a Naga orDragon, A Merlin or Druidhe). These and their variants, including the NorseAesir and the Gaelic Scythian (Aryan), Aes Dan, mean “he who sees” (Ashshur—hewho sees—[again: Ash Shar—“Seeing Lord”] from segment six of an Assyrian claytablet formed as a disc of eight segments, copied from an earlier Sumerianoriginal. This had been excavated from the ruins of the Royal Library ofNineveh), which is the very foundation and meaning of the Greek word Derkesthai,from whence we derive the word Dragon. In Aryan, Samael or Ahura Mazda (Ash-ura?) is called Tvashtri or TvAsh-Tri andrumour has it that he, the elder brother, actually sired Indra who, when thepantheon is streamlined, turns out to be Dyaus Pater. This has certainramifications when converted into Sumerian because Tvashtri “the Fashioner”converts, as we have seen, into Enki-Nidimmud “The Craftsman”, whose brotherisn't Ninurta (Indra), but Dyaus Pater or Enlil. The conflict between Enki and Enlil therefore, might have been more deep-seatedthan at first we realised, because it may not have been just simply the rivalrybetween two brothers, but the rivalry between a father—Enki, and his forbiddenbrother-son—Enlil. Such a conflict was played out between Zeus and Cronos (whohad led a rebellion of the Titans against Uranus), but also between Zeus andPrometheus. In Aryan (ancient Scythian) the Asuras are also called Devas, meaning “shiningones”, and this epithet also becomes applied to the members of both the Anunnakiand the later Fairies who descended from them. Earlier scholarly sources havethe name Anunnaki translated also as the variant “Anunnagi”, meaning “shiningones”, and here we have a relationship with the Vedic Nagas. From the Sumerian Chronicles we learn that the children of Anu were “theAnunnaki who decree the fates”. This meant that they themselves were also themori or fata, the “Fairies”, the scale-armoured leprechauns—the Dragon kings.They appear in the Aryan Vedas alongside their divine companions and arereferred to as the Nagas, who became the snake deities of India who guard asubmerged treasure, echoing the central theme of the grail and ring cycles. The Grail and the lake represent the womb. The Magic Ring hidden in the lake andthe red gold flow and dew of the Grail both represent the life-giving blood andmumae, the “submerged” or “hidden” treasure of the serpentttailed andSwan's-winged mermaids, the Naga goddesses of the north. Their wouivre, ordouble-ended tails and wings, are also to be found in representations of theancient “Aesir”—the Titan* or elder god—Typhon, son of Gaia and Tartarus. Theirother children included these Vampiric Lamias—the meremaids or naiads, and theirname is closely associated with Tartaria in Transylvania, the original home ofthe Dragon Queens and Kings. Several thousand years after the contest between Typhon and Zeus, Typhon's Fairydescendants, Ygraine, Morgana and Melusine were still portrayed in medievalChurch architecture with Typhon’s wings and double ended tail. A depiction ofMelusine with these physical attributes appears as a supporter in the arms ofthe Imperial and Royal House of Vere. In Typhon as a Dragon God, we remember Odin, who himself was often portrayed asa Dragon or serpent, a Naga, and that he too was an Aesir, a member of the old,warlike order of gods. Odin is always associated with Yggdrasil orYggd-Rad-Aes-Hel, the World Ash of the Norse. Here we will recall that thetree's name means Steed of Yggd or Odin and was a goddess who performed the samefunction as the Queens of Avalon. As a serpent he is often seen entwined aroundthe Aes Tree, echoing the depiction of Samael as the Serpent (N'H'SH), entwinedin Lilith's branches. Subtext—The NagaAt this juncture we must break off and study the Aryan Naga—the serpent devas,guardians of treasures “hidden in water”. We will do this by first looking atthe Hebrew word nahash. This word means serpent (and thus Dragon) and derivesfrom the consonant root N'H'SH—a snake. *Titan derives from the Sumerian TI.TI.AN which means:1) The breath of life of Anu (the Sons of Anu—the Nefilim)2) The Spirits of the Stars (the Star People) In Hebrew Qabalah and particularly, and rather oddly, in relation to the Jewishpractice of divination by birds or Ornithomancy, the serpent or Nahash is onewho discovers hidden secrets or wisdom from the Raven, the Dove or the Swan.(Warburg Lectures, Universtity of London, private dissertation on Qabalah andJewish Ornithomancy, 1996.) The N'H'SH is Enki-Samael the SU.HUR.MASH (Capricorn—the GoatHeaded Sea Serpent)or A.LU.LIM (Ram of the “Glittering” [or Shining, as in Elven] Waters),associated with Lilith of the Qlipphoth or “Abyss” (the APSU or watery deeps –i.e. lakes, wells, vulvas etc). Closely associated with the relationship between Lilith and Samael, as outlinedabove, are the Raven and Dove as birds of divination. In this context it becomesclear that these qabalistic, symbolic animals are meant to represent theValkiries, the Morganas and Magdalenes—the Ishtar priestesses who are theMaidens of the Ring and the Grail. The Dove, specifically the Turtle Dove or Barbary Dove; is a soft brown colourand has a ring around its neck that lies open at the throat. This Dove,specifically sacred to Venus, is a symbol of love and devotion, and is the birdreferred to in the name Mary Magdalene. Magdal or Migdal means a Dove. The ring around its neck is a torque, which, in Gaelic lore symbolises, as doall rings, Kingship and therefore wisdom and seership—the Derkesthai or DragonNature. That Mary is named Magdalene, “of the place of the doves” which aresacred to Venus and thus Ishtar, and mistakenly Hathor, means that she, Mary,was a priestess of this Goddess of “Love”. The link between the Raven, known as the Phoenix, the Dove and Samael isalchemical. At one level the Raven and the Dove are female and interchangeable,the Dove or doves (in Magdal: the place of doves or temple of the priestesses ofIshtar/Hathor/Venus), being the priestess or priestesses of Ishtar; theother—the Raven—being the priestess of Morrigan. The qabalah specifically says that the Raven and the Dove are the same bird andin the northern hemisphere the brown singing Ravens of the Druids are obviouslythe Turtle Doves or priestesses, brown Morrigans, equivalent to Swan maidens. Samael, in his congress with them, obtains the “wisdom of the qlipphoth” or theabyss—i.e. the waters of the deep. The Barbary Dove or Migdal links the ringcycle to Mary Magdalene and thence Jesus. Both are then linked again to Hathor,the Raven Goddesses of the Druids, to An and the Phoenix of the Scythians, andthence the Ring and the Dragon Orobourous, called Janus by the Phoenicians andJormungar by the Danes. Jormungar—“The Earth Spanner” : “the encircler” or Vala of the Vedas, lives inthe watery deeps and once upon a time long, long ago, Thor and the giant (Titan)Hymir went fishing for him. As bait they used an ox-head which, as we have seensymbolises the ovaries, fallopian tubes, womb and vagina of the virgin goddess. Here again is a link between water, Samael the Dragon and virgins. The BrownRaven or choral priestess of the Druidic cult is the Turtle Dove and the Swanmaiden because both animals are used in alchemy and Tantra to symbolise thebrain, the pineal gland and the Ajna Chakra. In Vala we have the original root of the words Valhalla and Valkirie. It is nowknown, as we had suggested, that the Valhallas were forest halls. There were infact built on mounds and displayed giant Dragon heads at each end. These werethe dwellings of the Vala Aes, the Dragon Overlords of the forest and beneaththem, lying in the Creachaire tomb-raths, were the remains of their ancestors,the Gods of Heaven. The Valhallas were the dwelling places of the Gods of Heaven and Earth, theserpent queens and kings. The Great Hall on the summit of the mound of theOtherworld was identical to the temple at the peak of the ziggurat. These Hallswere where the Valkiries, the singers of the Gods assembled. In this capacity,these were sometimes called the brown Ravens, meaning that they were still theMorrigans, but assumed the magical, Grail role of brown Turtle Doves, the loversof the Phoenix or Dragon God. Hence the Valhalla was also a variant of theJudaic Magdala or House of Doves. The Swan-serpent caduceus and the descended Dove originate here, and in placingthe paten into the Grail, both symbolise this love of the Turtle and thePhoenix. The serpillion is a Swan or serpent-necked Dove depicted in medievalarchitecture and the link here is clear. In the association of Lilith with theAbyss of the Qlipphoth and the Raven and Dove who symbolise Ishtar, we haveanother link between Diana and Persephone and a clarification of the nature ofHades. As the watery abyss, it is identified with the Gaelic Otherworld reached bywater. The masculine nature of the Raven is echoed in Machen's alchemical riddlewhere a serpent eating a serpent becomes a Dragon (a serpent which eats its tailmakes a circle and completes itself: it transcends). A Dragon eating a Dragon (atranscended one drinking from another transcended one, Samael drinking Lilith)becomes a Phoenix—a Raven King, Swan Knight/Prince, Dragon Queen, Rephaim etc. The Phoenix in its final transcendent glory becomes a flaming, leaping star, anAn, or Shining One. “The Nahash is taught by the Raven or the Dove” means thatthe Dragon Kings drink from Grail Princesses of the Abyss or Qlipphoth, the Treeof Life of the Left Hand Path—Kaula Vama Marg! That is, the pool at the foot ofYggdrasil. In The Phoenix and the Turtle by William Shakespeare (I don't think!), arementioned the Turtle Dove, the Phoenix, the Raven, the Swan and the Screech Owl(Lilith). It is said that out of the Phoenix myth, Shakespeare (I don't think!)created a myth of his own. Not so. What he did was to expand the myth and fillit with its proper alchemical symbolism and demonstrate the purpose of theoriginal story, that being divine union. For the full text of the poem, refer toAppendix 2. The Phoenix of myth is the only bird of its kind. It symbolises the Oneness ofthe All perceived by those who become united with the All, and thus are alone.It travels from its eastern paradise and makes a “nest” of “spices” (see Song ofSongs) in an Arabian Palm Tree. This is a Sufic symbol and emblem of the TamarisPrincesses (refer to Lily and Rose again, back a few pages). Having burnt up in its own fire (been consumed in the energy generated byenthea), it takes the ashes to the temple of the Sun at Heliopolis and lays themon the Altar. Other birds (ranks of Druidism aforementioned) and men gather torejoice. In chorus (Cor) they accompany the singing Phoenix as it soars toheaven and returns to its lonely paradise e.g. Samadhi, Bodhisatva, Heaven,Transcendence, Enlightenment, Divine Union, Scythia! Summary: the transcended Dragon King needs to drink from a Dragon Princess, aFairy lover. He travels to Arabia, meets his Tamaris and drinks from her “Nestof spices” and she bestows stillness and ecstasy upon him. He is consumed byfire (the spirit or combined energy). He is then reborn and takes the ashes ofhis mortal body, and lays on the altar of the Sun. This is symbolised by theDragon, Lion, Hawk and Bull in Persian Mithraism (Mithras the mediator orBalance) to symbolise his achievement of the balance or nil point and subsequentoneness with the Cosmos. Everyone is happy that he has managed to regenerate andwill not behave destructively now that he has refreshed his sovereignty with aliving goddess. He can now go back to Scythia/Heaven and carry on reigning andbeing the wisdom and fertility of the land, and that is the end of it. Shakespeare's version describes beautifully the emotions of enthea, and anyonewho has experienced this divine union with another of the blood will not fail tobe deeply moved, both with joy and sadness. Again this is another Solomonic,Vampire rite and proof yet again that vampirism is born of a love so deep thatit tears the soul from the body, as this tale suggests. It also implies that therite has to be repeated and that feeding must be recurrent. The OTO call the “Rite of the Phoenix” the “Mass of the Vampire” for goodreason. The Phoenix, along with the other birds in Shakespeare's poem are calledBennu Birds and are identified with each other by Kenneth Grant (MagicalRevival) and this is because all classes of Druid are Vampires and need to feedin order to remain transcendent. The Bennu Bird or Bird of Return symbolises a being that regenerates or mustregenerate itself at regular intervals and the Vampire itself bears anappellation that is named after this process. In folklore, however, the Vampire,as “one who returns” is mistaken for “one who returns from the grave” instead of“one who MUST return to feed and regenerate”. The Phoenix is symbolised in Transylvania by the double-headed Raven, brother ofLilith. This bird was adopted by the Hittites and came to symbolise the HolyRoman Empire in the corrupted form of an eagle. This DoubleHeaded Raven, thePhoenix, is the penultimate symbol of the Dragon people. In the last process ofits regeneration, the Phoenix becomes The Star, the An of the Anunnagi, theElves or Shining Ones: the ultimate symbol of the Dragon Race. The Serpent N'H'SHIn translating the word N'H'SH, firstly we will take the Hebrew consonants back,via Phoenician, to their Sumerian roots and remember also that, in Sumerian,syllable groups could be reversed and yet still render the same meaning in anoverall phrase. So, the N is Nun, the H is Heth (as opposed to He) and the SH isShin (as opposed to either Sade or Samekh). We check these through the Phoenician to ensure a continuity of shape in thecorrect pictograms as we venture back into the Sumerian and discover thefollowing: Nun = Nag, Heth = H.A. and Shin = Salmunuz. Therefore from the HebrewNahash we derive the original Sumerian Naghasalmunuz, Nagha Salmunuz orNAG.HA.SAL.MUNUZ., which translates as Drink (NAG)— Fish (HA)—Vulva (SALMUNUZ). If this sounds a bit odd, the author explains that a fish is “of water” and soin Sumerian the equivalent to our letter “A” means water, whilst the “H” is thearticle which stands for of. So the Hebrew N'H'SH—the Serpent—translates intothe Sumerian One (a Dragon) who—Drinks of (the) Water (of the) Vulva. One notices that in this phrase—Nagha Salmunuz—two things stand out. Firstly wehave the Aryan word Naga spelt Nagha which would be pronounced with the ghsounding like a nasally, softly gargled ch (as in the Scottish word loch).According to the OED, “H” which in Sumerian was H.A., evolved into theGreek—(h)eta which was originally pronounced kh, which was pronounced as definedabove, as an Iberian (Aryo-Scythian Celtic) x or ch. In this way we can also justifiably spell Naga as Naxa, and we then begin tounderstand the profound relationship between the Naga guardians of the Aryanpantheons and the Nixes or Nixas of western Europe. They were, likewise, thefemale guardians of watery treasures, and like the Nagas or Naxas, thesemeremaids or Swan Maidens were Devas or Shining Ones (Anunnagi). The second thing we notice is that the Sumerian word for a vulva is Salmunuz.Immediately the poetic connection between the “Sacred Vulva” (the Well ofNechtan [Nixtan]—the pure one, the Nix or Nothing) and the Salmon (Salmunuz) ofWisdom that swims in the well should spring to mind—as should the Ichthys—asbeing the vulva of the Virgin Mary Magdalene. Praise the Lord for the SinglePoetic Theme! In remembering that Sumerian can be reversed, we can look at the Hebrew N'H'SHagain. We will see that if it is reversed, as was the custom in Hebrew Qabalahwhen rabbis were experimenting with language looking for hidden meanings, itbecomes SH'H'N which is pronounced She'an, “of the Powers”. Furthermore thenumerical or gematric value of N'H'SH in Qabalah is 9, which is the number ofYesod, the Sephira of the Moon, whose Phoenician God was the Sumerian SIN orSHIN—She'en. The symbols associated with SIN included the Axe, the Labrys which is a devicewhich, as we know, depicts the Vulva. The Axe symbol, prevalent in Mittani andMinoan Cretan culture, became the spinning Hammer of Thor (the Swastika) who, asZeus, was the wielder of the lightning bolt. This, in northern Europe, wassymbolised by the Norse “Sig” Rune. Sig—the lightning bolt of inspiration (cf.Mead of Inspiration)—is the Greek Sigma which is the Hebrew Shin, the lastconsonant of N'H'SH, and SIN—Sumerian god of the Moon. Sig is the serpentine lightning bolt that courses down the Qabalistic Tree ofLife. In one sense it represents Enki-Samael entwined around Lilith. Theupturned crescent moon is also said to be associated with Samael (SumaireEl)and, in an ancient Sumerian picture reproduced by Langdon, the moon as a dish isdepicted next to the Star of Anu, below which is the serpent N'H'SH entwinedaround the tree, symbolising Lilith. Finally we must consider Tiamat. Her name—TI.A.MAT—means lifewater-maiden. Thistranslates as “maiden of the waters of life” and it is then clear that her nameindicates she was both the first known matriarch and virgin priestess—the “feeding mother”—of the Vampire Dragon queens and kings. The mother of the Elvendynasty, she was the generatrix of a Vampire lineage of goddess-queens andgod-kings spanning seven thousand years. She was a Nagha or Nixa and it is from her that Lilith, and all the ensuingGrail Maidens, including Sheba and Morgana of the Apple Trees, Tamaris, MaryMagdalene, the Princesses of Avalon, Melusine, Niniane and Ygraine owe theiridentifications as “Trees of Life”. Consequently we can say that Tiamat, thefirst Tamaris—the Maiden who gives the Waters of Life—was also the Tir Mat orTir Mata, the first “Tree Mother” of the Lords and Ladies of the Forest, theDruids and Druidesses—the People of the Trees (of Life). Two of the younger gods of the Aryans, the Adityas, Tara and Bhaga, stand outprominently. As we have seen, Ulick Beck and several other scholars have tracedthe origin of the Scythian-Irish Tuadha d'Anu to the same region as the Aryans,and have gone as far as saying that they were one and the same. Interestingly wefind that the goddess Tara—wife of Rudra, Indra's charioteer, appears in Eire asTara, the Hill or Rath of ghosts in County Meath, Eire. Tara was the sacredcentre of the united Irish kingdom and was the seat of the Danaan Kings of Taraduring the Iron Age. Some scholars attribute the name of Tara in Eire to some complicated soundinggod name which I find implausible in light of the fact that a Goddess Taraalready existed in the Scythian-Aryan pantheon. Whether it be Asura or Aditya,Danaan or Milesian, all of the ancient Goddess Queens were the source ofsovereignty associated with sacred mounds. It therefore seems entirelyappropriate to name a Sidhe Rath, a portal to the Otherworld and thus the sourceof sovereignty, after a goddess who would herself have represented sovereignty. In the case of Bhaga, or Vaga, as his name would have been pronounced in Gaelic,scholars think that he became the Slavic god Bogh, a word which came to mean“god” in Thrace, where the Danaan Fir Bolg were once exiled prior to theirreturn to Ireland. In Fir Bolg we either have the title “men of God”, meaningDruids, or we have, as is commonly thought, “men of the bags”. This means “menof God” anyway, because the “bag”, specifically the “Crane Skin Bag”, was anaccessory of the Godthi's and the Druid's: the “men of the gods”. "},{"pageContent":"[images/00022.jpg] Chapter 14 Myth or Reality?The World of J.R.R. Tolkien Considering the foregoing, it is interesting to note that in Tolkien'sSilmarillion—the background mythology that supports his Lord of the Rings—wefind a vocabulary and etymology that includes the following words—Ainur, Ainu,Vala, Maiar, Eldar, Ea. Tolkien's word Ainur means the “Holy Ones”, of which the singular is Ainu. Thereare two orders of these gods in his mythology—the Valar and the Maiar. Theplural Ainur and the singular Ainu are clearly derived from the Sumerian fatherof the gods—Anu and the Anunnaki, whilst Valar appears in the Aryan pantheon asVala “The Encircler”, reminiscent of the Orobourus, the alchemical Dragon Ringthat Tolkien wrote so much about. We will also remember the Val-Kyrie at thisjuncture. The word Maia is spelt Maja in Spanish and denotes a female line of nobility androyalty. The “i” was originally “j” and came, along with the word majesty, fromthe Latin majes or majus, a variant of which is magi or Magus, from the Greekmagos—a bloodline member of a caste or genetic strain comprised of individualsheritably steeped in magic. (OED) In other words, it was the Arya—or ScythianDerkesthai—the Dragon Goddess Queens and God Kings. At this point we return to the concept of the Derkesthai and the bloodline ofthe Dragon god-kings—the Asuras and the Anunnaki. In the Silmarillion, Maiabecomes Maiar. It accords with the ancient concept of deific royalty—Maia—which,related to Mana, is the “spirit of the gods carried in the blood”. This is theattribute of a goddess-queen or god-king of the Dragon who are in themselvescollectively an “order of the gods”—the “Elves” —the shining ones—or “godsincarnate”—the Devas and Avatars. The “spirits of the gods—the ancestors—carried in the blood”, we will remember,are the spirits summoned from the “deeps”, the subconscious, by the Witch(Vampire or Druid). He gains her or his name—Wicce or Wicca— from the ability toyield or bend to, or rather to draw to the surface of consciousness, thesespiritual intelligences and their wisdom from her or his ancestral, and thusgenetic, inheritance. In other words their waking consciousness is pacified or“yields”, to allow the older spirit, or racial memory, to give voice. Avatar is a word Tolkien included in his Silmarillion as Aratar, the eight mostpowerful of his Valar or order of old gods. It seems obvious that these wereintended to mimic the Egyptian gods of the Ogdoad, the eight Anunnaki who tendedthe Holy Mountain after the Black Sea flood. Another of Tolkien's words, similar to Avatar (Avathar to him) means “TheShadows”, which he uses as a name for a land near his “Bay of Eldemar”.Comparably, in our world, an Avatar is a “god made flesh”—a Dragon King or Queenwho often occupied tombs and would have been thought of as a “shadow”, a spiritof the Otherworld, from the realm of the Shining Ones. Therefore in the Vala and Maiar we have two orders of gods taken from the Dragontradition itself. Bearing this in mind, according to the legends of Tolkien'sElves, the word Eldar became used as a name for the three Elven kindreds, one ofwhich Tolkien named the Vanyar, who appear to be the Vanir Gods of the Danes,cousins of the Tuadha d'Anu. Tolkien's largest variety of wicked Orcs he named the Uruks. Uruk is aCity-State of the Anunnaki. The Orcs, he said, were once fair Elves who had beenimprisoned and tortured in the Land of Mordor. “Eldar”, explains Tolkien, means “People of the Stars”, echoing a traditionalGaelic epithet for the Tuadha d'Anu and also one of the original meanings of thename Anunnaki—People of the Stars. Of men, Tolkien concurs that they are the second, younger race which his Elvescalled the Atani (Adamae), a name, says Tolkien, that later became the Edain,obviously the children of Eden. Again we have a borrowing of Dragon Lore wherethe Elves, the Children of Anu, the Anukim or Repha'im of the Old Testament,appeared first, followed by our Adamae, or the Atani as Tolkien would have it. Edain is obviously Eden, whilst he uses Ea as a name for the Earth which inSumerian is the name for the Dragon god of the “Earth and Waters”— Enki-Samael,the leader of the elder “Eldar” gods—the Aesir. Tolkien, in his epic works, withtheir plethora of borrowed names and borrowed linguistics and their elder andyounger races, is obviously writing about the family. This is particularly sowhen one peruses his vocabulary and discovers the name Avallónë, a haven andcity of the Eldar—the Elves—situated on “the lonely isle”—Tol Eressea. This wasdrawn across the ocean and rooted finally in the Bay of Eldemar, adjacent toAvathar—the land of Shadows: our Avalon or Otherworld. The various names by which our planet is known all stem from the word Eridu,which was the first city founded by Enki-Samael in Mesopotamia. As a variant ofEridu, in the Silmarillion, Tolkien has Eriador and his Elven word for Earth isArda, which is also derived from Eridu. The Origin of the Dragon Lords of the RingsThe following are technical support notes to the essays included in this work.As such there will be numerous repetitions of the subjects covered, however, awealth of extra material follows which could not be drawn in detail into thenarrative of the essays. The Sabbatical GoatThe symbol of the goat's head in the inverted pentagram is said to be thetraditional glyph of medieval European Satanic Witchcraft. Since that time theSabbatical Goat has become ubiquitous throughout the left-hand path ofoccultism. The letters around the perimeter, usually displayed in Hebrewconsonants in common usage, spell L'V'Th'N: Leviathan. In apocryphal Jewish holyliterature it was Lilith, fleeing to the Red Sea, who became identified with theLeviathan, a sea monster, often portrayed as a giant serpent or Draken. The colours used in representations of the above are invariably red on black.Although thought of as Satanic, these colours on the Aziluth or Imperial levelof the Cabalistic Tree of Life are not Satanic at all, but are Sacred to Binah.The Emperor is red, representing dynamism, and the Empress is black,representing the primordial sea of Understanding or Being; i.e. Space/Time. Redand Black were used by Cathars, who tied their BlueBlack Robes (cf. Sufi cloaks)with the hated “little Red Cord”. This also appears as the Garter or Points inScottish Witchcraft. The use of a red cord has a twofold symbolism in that it isalso identified as the woollen cord that was wrapped around the horns of theScapegoat of Jewish history. The Scapegoat was identified as Azazel, an angel orNephilim/Watcher, a prototype of the later sacrificial God/King. The Red Threador Rtus, placed around the goat’s horns represents the menstrual flow. Thisacknowledged that the goat’s head represents the goddess. It also represents theapplication of the menstruus on the mind of the sacrificial king who would thentranscend and take the prayers of the people to the underworld. The later ritual of the scapegoat, where one goat is sent to wander in thewilderness, is a precursor to the actual killing of a priest king who would alsobe expected to take the supplications of his tribe and present them to the gods.As with all religious ritual, the substance becomes lost and is replaced by theform of obsessive, habitual activity which, wrongly, is considered in itself tobe efficacious. Binah is ruled by the Planet Saturn or Chronos. This takes us into the Titanicperiod of civilisation which preceded the Jehovan or Olympic age. The sacredflower of Binah is the Lily and its tree is the Cypress, used for both funeralsand weddings (i.e. both destruction and creation). Its sacred animal is the bee,the Sacred Mason and the drinker of the nectar of the Lily. Uniting the conceptof marriage (sexual union) with death (negation) is Tantric/Proto Cabalistic andtherefore Aryan; and therefore Ubaid in origin. The sex-negation concept iscentral to the theory of hierogamy, divine union and Courtly Love which isexpressed in alchemy and inextricably linked to the drinking of the “nectar” ofthe Lily and the Rose. This is the true meaning of the Merovian Bee, which in its use by them was alsointended to link them with the forgoing concepts and the Primordial Sea, thewaters of Chaos or Tiamat as well as Lilith. Saturn (Anu) and Lilith's sacred colour is purple, which is the origin of itsuse by Emperors and kings. Displaying this colour denotes their descent fromLilith and also the Titans. Saturn is the predominant planetary sphere ruling Capricorn, whose planetaryarchangel or nephilim was Azazel. The Sabbatical Goat developed from Khem(formerly Azazel) whose cult was centred upon the Temple of Mendes. LaterGrecian expressions of this cult cast the Khem as Pan who, by the medievalperiod, had become Pan-Khem: the Solar-Goat deity of the French Witches. Trainedby the Templars and Cathars, they provided, in a very basic form, a plebeian andreligious variant of the more complex scientific and genealogical tenets ofthose whom they supported. To them, “Satan”, the Sabbatical Goat, was the “GoodGod”, the liberator from Church oppression and the iron grip of their otherChristianised overlords. The principal figure at these Sabbats was a figure with a shining gold torso andthe head and legs of a goat. It was revered as the Black and Gold Sun, echoingthe origins of Khem as a solar deity but also embodying the Draconian symbol ofSirius, the Black Sun or eight pointed star. In England Khem-Pan was known as Puck, the son of Titania (Titans) and RobinHood or Robin Goodfellow. Goodfellow is reminiscent of “The Good Folk” andprovides one of many links between English and Scottish Witchcraft and theFairies, who are also called the Gentry (because they literally were the lordsand nobles of many districts) and “Shining Ones”. British Sabbats were overseen by a “Man-in-Black”, usually the local Lord orBaron who was worshipped as the God of the Sabbat, i.e. Robin or Satan, Pan orKhem. Witchcraft in Europe and Britain was run by the Templars and Cathars andprovided the groundswell of support at the grassroots level for the Fairy, alsoknown as Grail, also known as Dragon families and the doctrines which made themdistinct. Witchcraft is original Christianity, practising Christian gnosticDualism and providing, in their tens of thousands, an army of support for thescions of Christ. The Church persecuted Templars, Cathars and Witches equally as heretics. IfWitchcraft was, as the more modern apologists claim, a pagan religion, it wouldnot have attracted the animosity of the Church, who only prosecuted heterodoxChristians. A final note on Chronos/Saturn/Anu. He was the inventor of Agriculture and thusmay be identified with the Annunaki of Sumeria who also developed advancedfarming techniques and settled agriculture. Wherever one travels in the world,the figure of Saturn is invariably depicted as an old man with a beard leaningon a staff. This occurs even in societies where the members don't grow facialhair themselves. He was the Grim Reaper, the god who controlled the fate of man.As such, he was in the fullest and most precise terms the God-King of theFairies, the Fata or Fates. Pan was the son of Hermes. Hermes was an intermediary between the gods and man,a prototype of the Pontiff or bridge, the God-King. As Mercury he is alsoidentified with Odin, another sacrificial god, whose totem animals, the Ravenand the wolf, both feature as grades of initiation in Mithraism and are specificgrades of Vampire in Romanian tradition. The Stregoica or wolf-Vampire(werewolf) of Romanian tradition derives from the root word Strega, which isLatin, and where Stregoica is a Vampire in Romanian (which is a Roman language),in Italian a Strega is a Witch. The Turkish for Vampire is Uber, a Witch. Notethe German, Übermensch, meaning demi-god or superman.. Mithras is a balancing factor between good and evil, an intermediary very muchlike Hermes. Odin, as the one-eyed God, mediates between the worlds and to gainthe wisdom of both hanged upon Ygdrassil, a Lilith-Samael symbol of the Tree ofLife/Knowledge. As a blinded god, he is reminiscent of the blind serpent whomediated between Lilith and Samael at their union. Chem-ZoroasterHam is known traditionally as Chem. In Hermetics and Dualism he is known asChem-Zoroaster, “a great and venerable Magus”, the 10th Archon of the Age ofCapricorn. As Archon or representative, he is identified with Capricorn as itsphysical manifestation, i.e. he is Capricorn. Originally the symbol for Capricorn was a creature half goat, half sea monster.This takes us back to the inverted pentagram of the Sabbatical Goat encircled bythe word (also meaning issuing from the space or womb of) Leviathan who is theSea Monster (Lilith), and Sea Dragon of primordial chaos (Tiamat). Therefore theSabbatical Goat is Capricorn the Sea Goat. As the Egyptian God, the Sabbatical Goat is Khem, the solar deity of Mendes.Khem is a variant spelling of Chem who is Ham, the Archon of Capricorn andCapricorn incarnate. Ham, the accursed one of the Christian Bible, moved toEgypt. As a Dragon God-King of the Line of Annunaki, the originators andDraconian Patrons of human kingship, Ham or ChemZoroaster—became Khem the firstSebekh. The Sebekh is the Crocodile (water/sea Dragon or Leviathan) God, who isthe Patron of Kingship. He wears a solar (cf. Khem) disc upon his foreheadsuspended between two (goat) horns. Ham or Chem is Sobekh 1st; T'Ham'Pthis, thefirst Dragon king of Egypt to use the Sebekh title and thus proclaim his rightto create kings, and was the first God King of the Egyptian Cult of Draco. The Sobekh title may distinguish the grafted line of the immigrant Dragon kingsof Sumeria from the indigenous Semitic, Nubian and other dynasties. Ham asChem-Zoroaster and also as Khem and later Pan, son of Hermes, is closely linkedto the concept of Aryan Dualism and its symbol—the entwined serpents, Mazda andAhriman, light and dark. Mazda is Ormuzd and Ahriman is Enlil or Jehovah. Ormuzd derives from theIndo-European Orm, a worm or Dragon and Masd, white or light, hence white worm(see Vampire mythology) or Dragon of Light. Ahriman is thus the Dragon ofDarkness, hence the Satanic inversion “Good is Evil and Evil is Good”. Theentwined serpents or Dragons appear as the serpents of the caduceus of Hermes,who is father of Pan, the Goat-headed solar deity Khem. The caduceus is crownedwith a solar winged-disc and the entwined serpents are reminiscent of thedouble-helix ribbons of the thyrsis wand of Dionysus, which is crowned by thepine cone, depicting the pineal gland. The symbols are variants of each other ina Hermetic sense. Dionysus was the son of Zeus. The worship of Dionysus was brought from India bythe Alexandrian Greeks. Zeus, his father, was known as the Indian or AryanDispater, which translates as Deus Pater or father god, also known as Enlil orJehovah. If Hermes can be identified as a variant of Mithras, who was descendedfrom the Aryan Zirvan, then Hermes is either an uncle or brother of Dionysus.Zirvan is Time. Saturn or Chronos is Old Father Time. Therefore Zirvan and Saturn are identifiable. Consequently Mithras is Hermes,son of Chronos, who also fathered Zeus. Hermes and Zeus are brothers. If Zeus isEnlil, then Hermes is Enki, Samael, Masdoa (Mazda, i.e. Mazda is Mithras).Hermes is the father of Pan and Zeus is the father of Dionysus. Pan and Dionysusare always featured in the same retinue and, as Bacchus, Pan's rites duplicatethose of his twin, Dionysus. The totem animals of Dionysus are the Panther (cf.Jesus ben Panther), the Goat and the wolf (Stregoica, werewolf, Mithraic totem,etc.). Other symbols include the basket with alchemical eggs and serpents. TheDionysic Rites were cannibalistic and Vampiric and echo the era of cannibalismand vampirism of the sons of the Nephilim (the era of Titans). If Zirvan is the Titan Chronos, father of Zeus-Enlil, then Chronos is Anu, whois the son of Apsu or Uranus. The union between Hermes (Samael) and Aphrodite(Venus, as in Venus-Sheba-Lilith) included the nymph Salmacis with whom theyenjoined much, as with Samael, Lilith and the blind serpent. Hermes is the uncleof Dionysus, who is the cousin of Pan. The BaphometIn Draconian Tradition (see Kenneth Grant) Baphomet is translated as Bapho Mitraor Father Mithras. Baphomet is also rendered as Head or Source of Wisdom. IfBaphomet is rendered Father (or Source) Mithras, and Mithras is identified asSamael the Dragon, then one has the Source or Head Dragon, the origin ofPenDragon. Baphomet, the “Deity” of the Templars, was described as being both the Head ofWisdom, which has Celtic and Galatian origins, and the Sabbatical Goat. TheSabbatical Goat, in the form of the Templar glyph also used by the Cathars, themedieval Witches and later generally by satanists and left-hand path occultists,was more complex than the simple pentagram. Baphomet was pictured as across-legged figure (cf. Cernunnos and Krishna, both Lords of the Forests andidentifiable with Herne the Hunter. He is Annwn and Odin, who led the Wild Huntin search of “Fairy Women” (sic) with the head and legs of a goat, the scalytorso of a Dragon, the breasts of a woman and the phallus of a man. Baphomet has Angel's Wings (Swan’s feathers) and a torch between its horns. Itsright arm is raised with index and forefinger extended. On the forearm iswritten the word Coagula. The fingers point to the new moon. Its left arm pointsdown and to the side and the index and little finger are extended to form thehorns of the goat. The fingers point to the old or black moon (Kali). On theleft forearm is written the word Solve. Solve and Coagula are alchemical terms;spiritual death and resurrection played out in the perennial concept of Enthea. On its forehead there is displayed a pentagram with its single point uppermost.In the simpler form, the goat's head traces the figure of the inverted pentagramand thus it is to be understood that one pentagram equals the other. Therefore,if the single-point pentagram represents the Goddess, then she and the Goat areone, as is represented by the combining of male and female sexual attributes inone symbol. Such a thorough union of the two sexes negates the individuality ofboth. On the magical level this again represents death (of the selves) throughmarriage of the two, leading to the alchemical, tantric concept of illumination.This occurs through hierogamy facilitated by the cubic jewel (Emerald of Venus)depicted in the inverted pentagram where the conjunction of the geometric lineswith those of the crutch of the horns forms the “Jewel in the Crown of Lucifer”,the cubic stone or Grail. Again, when reversed, the simpler pentagram representsthe goddess. The goat's chin becomes her head, its ears her arms, and its horns her legs. TheJewel, the emerald cubic stone, then becomes her vulva and womb. Baphometreflects this idea with the conjoining of the goat head and upright pentagramand enlarges upon the idea by displaying a flame between the horns. The Flame isWomb Fire or Starfire, enlightenment through the fluid of the womb. The sex and death idea, as we have discovered, belongs to Binah and the variousattributes and symbols of that Sephira should be recollected in relation to theBaphomet symbol. The wings of Baphomet are Swan's wings. This immediately speaks of the SwanPrinces, Grail Princesses and Fairy Queens which symbolise the Dragon blood.Baphomet is a Nephilim. Its legs are the legs of Pan. Its head is the head ofKhem, which conjoined to the serpent or Dragons torso representing Leviathan.This indicates the same as the Sabbatical Pentagram. The figure represents Hamor Chem or Khem-Zoroaster the Sebekh, Archon and incarnation of Capricorn, thegoat-headed Dragon of the Sea. Entwined around the phallus of Baphomet are the serpents of the type representedon the caduceus of Hermes. This also reinforces the Zirvan-MithrasAhrimanidentification. The Phallus as staff or Tree of Life is the Plantagenista in onesense which, in being capped by an egg, is the symbol of potential whichqualifies the image. Conclusion: Baphomet is a type of Chem-Zoroaster who is theQuinotaur associated with Meroveus. Baphomet and the Mendes pentagram are genealogical badges—early forms ofheraldry—incorporating the symbolism of the blood rites. Note: We have shown theconnection between Merovingians—Bees—Binah— Primordial Sea—Chaos—Tiamat—DragonQueen. Therefore Merovingians = Dragons. The inverted pentagram and goat symbolis not Satanic, it is a dynastic marker. Satanism, as devil worship, is justCatholicism inverted. The PictsWhilst the Picts endured internal exile in Scotland, their distant cousinsfaired less well in England and Wales. Foreign encroachment had been intense inthese countries and forestry had been decimated. Both populations north andsouth of the border were less technologically advanced and adaptable than theincomers, being essentially nomadic Priest Kings and not farmers. However thePicts in Scotland managed to survive longer than those on the rest of theisland, who were forced to live in less and less space as time went on. Bothcultures became even more insular because of their inability to cope with livingoutside the forests. Instead they retained their kinships and their cultureseparately from the outside world, venturing out to steal in order to supplementthe dwindling resources in their own wooded kingdoms, or waylaying travellerswho dared to trespass on their greenwood domains. With the marriage of King Kenneth MacAlpin to Princess Uistnecc of the Picts inthe 9th century, the Pictish and Scottish Kingdoms became united and many Lordsand Princes of the Dalriada sought magical Pictish Princesses for themselves. Inthis manner, many Picts slowly became integrated within Scottish society andleft their Forest Kingdoms forever to follow their Ladies and Lords. However notall succumbed to life outside the domain of the ancient woodland and asufficient number remained to sustain both kingship and culture in the manner oftheir ancestors, against a new encroachment and a far more insidious threat—therise of Roman Christianity. By MacAlpin's era, the Catholic Church had enacted the Donation of Constantine(312 AD) for some centuries and had attempted to divest all but their own ClientRoyal Houses of the right of Kingship. By implementing policies of regicide andcontrolled marriage, the Church had attempted to breed out the pre-Carolingianroyal bloodlines that stood for genuine kingship, and thus posed a potentialthreat to the stranglehold that the Church had gained over the monarchy. By the medieval period a new weapon had emerged from the Vatican arsenal—theInquisition. As the Grail and Pictish Royal and Noble Houses followed a separatespiritual path to that laid down in 325 AD at the Council of Nicaea, thosehouses and their retainers and supporters were subjected to several hundredyears of persecution and terror. This was done ostensibly to purify theChristian Faith of heresy and rid the world of Witchcraft. In fact it was simplyto thin out the opposition. Pictish and Merovingian spiritual doctrines varied but were born from the sameroot tradition that Jesus followed, that being the Indo-Aryan Priest Caste, theMagi or Druids. This set of doctrines, so at variance with the Church'spretend-version of Jesus' teaching, was labelled Witchcraft and heresy.Countless people died as a result of believing in it and supporting the Royaland Noble Houses who were its hidden Priests and Priest Kings. In Scotland and France many noble houses of Merovingian and Pictish descent weremassacred and the Inquisition took on the proportions of a “holy” crusade, whichoften destroyed whole towns and villages. In England the Kings from WilliamRufus' time were far less inclined to indulge the Pope. The Angevin Houses werebarely Christian themselves and had far more than “just a smattering” of bothDanaan and Merovingian blood. Consequently, up until the Tudor period the Witch craze in England was bycomparison quite a sedate and subdued affair. Indeed the very “Fairy Kingships”that the Vatican were so scared of and were trying to eradicate, were actuallyrecognised, lauded and supported by a succession of English monarchs. Theseincluded Richard I, Edward III, Henry VIII and Elizabeth I, despite thequestionable provenance and claims of the two latter monarchs and theirinstitution of illegal constitutional practices. These ancient Kingships were ritually observed in the old families within whichthe right descended. The pre-Christian King in a late post-Christian setting wasoften called Robert or Robin Hood or Goodfellow. Often associated withWitchcraft, his realm, like his Fairy ancestors the Picts, was the Greenwood andhis subjects were the pagan rustics who inhabited every district across thecountry. The stories of the coven meetings by dead of night in the forest deepor in the open moor are stories of the survival of a culture and its kingship.It precedes the coming of the Romans, the Saxons and the Church with itsfraudulent and thus spurious form of Christian Monarchy. Though two reasonably distinct but related lines, the Pictish and theMerovingian cultures amalgamated in Britain symbolically in the merging of theFrench and Scottish Arthurian legends and the Pictish tales of the Forest Lordsand Ladies. A close study of the characters and some of the events in bothtraditions will reveal that not only are they similar to each other but theybare a striking resemblance to the story of Jesus who, in Celtic Christianity,is termed a Magus and Druid. This appears to be the problem as far as the Churchwas concerned. Having broadcast the idea that Jesus, the rightful King, had no descendants, theway was left open for his “appointed” apostles, the Roman Bishops to assume therole of kingship. However, there still persisted the stubborn insistence in somefamilies that they and not the Church were the rightful kings of the people byblood descent from Christ. In the matter of both Robin and Arthur, theMerovingians and the Picts, it was well known by Roman clerics that the line ofJesus and the line of the Tuatha de Danaan originated from the same Royalbloodline. They realised that all the time that line remained in existence, theChurch was in danger of being toppled by a popular movement led by one of thesedynasties. Therefore the Church demonised Robin and pronounced the Grail heretical.Nevertheless, in the late medieval period in Scotland, England and France, the“Witches” still met and the Local Noble of the Blood Royal would preside asRobin Hood, Robin Goodfellow, Samael, L'Homme Noir or the “Devil”. He wasaccompanied by his Queen and Priestess, the Diana or Marian. In Tudor England,Henry VIII reconstituted Priest-Kingship and his daughter, Elizabeth the “FairyQueen”, was excommunicated for refusing to allow the Catholics back into power.A case of right action, wrong actors. The Stag of WindsorBefore Elizabeth was crowned by the Bishops, she underwent coronation by thepeople. Attending the ceremony were a host of “Wild Forest Dwellers” who hadcome to bless the new Queen. Later in her reign she attended a curious ceremonyin the Forest of Windsor Great Park. "},{"pageContent":" Seated before a pavilion in a clearing one spring morning, Queen Elizabeth, withher complicity and consent, presided over one of the most ancient Druidic andshamanic ceremonies in Eurasian culture. A ceremony that harked back to the timewhen much of Britain and the continent was covered by massive forests, namelythe trial and accession of the King of the Caille Daouine, the Lord of theForest. The King of the Forest is the Stag of Nine Tines. In the lays of Robin Hood,Robin himself is revealed as the Green Stag and the Totem is repeatedlyinterwoven into the fabric of ancient northern Kingship. In pre-Christian andnon-Christian Europe, to claim the Kingship of the vast Greenwood, the pretenderwas obliged to ride and kill whilst mounted, the great Stag of Nine Tines. This task was possibly one of the most dangerous stunts anyone could pull.During the Spring Rut the Stag is vicious, belligerent and half mad with lustand territorial rage. Getting anywhere near him was a feat of courage in itself.However, to be rightly invested with the true kingship of the Forest Peoples, itwas first necessary to depose the reigning monarch, the Great Stag. On the spring morning in question one of Elizabeth's favourites, the Queen'sChamberlain, Edward de Vere, charged into the clearing mounted upon the greatStag of Windsor Forest. Its throat had been cut by the rider, and he and theStag came to an abrupt halt at the Queen's feet. Edward de Vere was the premierCount of England and the senior Peer of the Realm. His lineage was far superiorto that of Elizabeth, he descended from the House of Anjou, from Melusine andthe ancient Pictish and Danaan Druid Kings of Gaul, Albany and Eire. A necromancer, anti-Christian and libertine, Edward had contempt for the Tudors.He was a scholar under Dr John Dee and it is still insisted that Edward was thetrue William Shakespeare, whose work is teeming with stories of Elphame andMagic. Edward de Vere, Christopher Marlowe, Francis Bacon, Sir Walter Raleigh,Edmund Spenser, Edward Kelly and John Dee comprised the Secret ElizabethanMagical Cabal immortalised as the “School of Night” in the Bard’s “Love’sLabours Lost”. Shakespeare’s Oberon is Alberic, whose name literally means ElfKing, whilst his Titania is Diana, whose Druidic, woad coloured Boar wears hercrescent Moon upon its flank in the crest of the ancient family of Vere. Three of Edward's recent ancestors had borne the name Alberic. The first of themin England had adopted also the falling star of Lucifer as a badge to denote, asVerily Anderson expresses it, the Vere's “near divinity” as descendants of theline of priest kingship that originated with the first Elf King— Samael orLucifer. What the Queen had attended and approved was the investiture of an ancientForest King who, in her time, would have been the spiritual custodian of thehidden royal blood and the true cultural legacy of the British people. For centuries the tales of Robin Hood had circulated around Britain. The ritualinvestiture of de Vere can be added to the corpus of that spiritual traditionwhich, apart from the obvious confusions between the ceremonial Forest Kings,the real Robin Hoods, and the plethora of common or garden murderers, villainsand kidnappers, has thrived everywhere there has been a Grail family supportedby the People, assuming their regional roles as the ancient Priest Kings andPriestess Princesses of the Dragon and the Greenwood. Some one hundred and fifty years after Edward de Vere, a Scottish cousin of hiswas the hereditary chief of the 13 covens of Mid-Lothian. A Consort of the Queenof Elphame (a descendant of the early Pictish or “Fairy” Princesses), MajorThomas Weir, Laird of Kirkton and the infamous sorcerer of Edinburgh, hadhimself conducted the ancient rite of Druidic Kingship in the ceremony of Epona.Major Weir is Byron’s Mannfred and is celebrated by Sir Walter Scott. Professor Margaret Murray insists that he was, like his cousins and ancestors, aPriest King of the Elven Line of the Grail and the Dragon. In 1670 he and hissister were convicted of Witchcraft and burned at the stake. His trial recordsshow that his conviction for being a Witch depended entirely upon whether or nothe (and his sister) had been servants or consorts of the Fairies. They had, andthey died for it. The Earl of Bothwell is said to have replaced him in 1690. Attempts have often been made to identify “The Real Robin Hood”. Numerouscharacters have been put forward as likely candidates and perhaps the nearestanyone has got to pinning him down was Professor Murray when she identifiedRobin Hood as a collection of composites from many regions and many times. Atthe heart of her theory is the assertion that Robin was a god figure that was atthe centre of the cult of Witchcraft. Indeed this is the case, as is her discovery that the Witches’ god wasrepresented at the Sabbats by one or other individual who, regardless of theregional or cultural variation of the period, invariably descended from a Grailor Dragon-Fairy family. The rituals of Witchcraft were varied and containedsyntheses of Catharist and Templar Dualism, Druidism and Bacchanalian practices.The Dianic rites were observed by the Royal Covens, and generally the “religion”of Witchcraft more closely resembled Jesus' own doctrine than the Church itself. This is borne out by the Druids’ ready acceptance of Celtic Christianity, andthe fact that Jesus' original, undoctored Gnostic teachings were founded onEssene Magian philosophy amalgamated with the mystical doctrines of Mithras andDionysus. Alchemy, Cabala and Hermetics were the centre of Christ's philosophy.All the foregoing are components of that Eurasian “religion” we know as Druidismwhich, for the Indians is Hinduism and for the Persians is Zoroastrianism—and,in the West, eventually became our Celtic Christianity. Robin Hood or Robert Hod or Od is Odin—the Blinded God “Samael”. As Master ofthe Wild Hunt, he is Herne and Cernunnos, the Lord of the Forest. In Hinduism heis also the Lord of the Forest as Vishnu, in his incarnation as the Blue Boar.As Samael he is also Pan and Khem, ChemZoroaster and Mazda. The Son of Anu is aDragon King of the Danaan. He is Herne—The Great Stag of Nine Tines—the King ofthe Ancient Eurasian Forests. Jesus played his part as evidenced by St.Augustine's letter to his disciple Ceretius in 400 AD. Augustine states thatJesus often sat cross-legged in the middle of a circle of his followers in themanner of Pan or the Templars’ Baphomet, and he would play an accompaniment totheir ring dances, invoking aloud the Ogdoad or Eight Great planetary Spirits ofthe Gnosis. English and European Woodcuts of the Reformation period show Pan or“Robin Goodfellow” engaged with his Witches in identical firelit, woodlandfrolics. If he were alive during the medieval period, Jesus Christ our Saviourwould have been arraigned by the Inquisition and tried and burned at the Stakefor both heresy and Witchcraft! "},{"pageContent":"[images/00011.jpg] Chapter 15 Jesus Mac Art The word Jesus used to describe his assembly was “Church”. The word derives from“Circa”, a Ring or Circle. In the Celtic Christian period, going to Church wascalled “Going to the Stones” or Stone Circles. Jesus was a Messiah or DragonKing. Those who followed him by blood descent, either through the DavidicMerovingian lines or through the Scythian descent of the Dragon Kings of Anu,both of which lines have a common origin and share many historical dynasticalliances, often assumed, as Jesus did, the role of the “Robin Hood”. Perhaps the name varied from country to country or from region to region but theidentity was essentially the same, and the figures of the pageant of the ElvenKings of the Forest were perennial. Even Charlemagne, who wed an eastern FairyPrincess, belongs in the cycle of stories celebrating the continuity of theblood of the Dragon Queens and Grail Kings. His wedding to Frastrada was blessedby the appearance at the feast by a Dragon bearing in its mouth an Alchemist'sRing of Power, which it dropped into Charlemagne's chalice of blood red wine. One might suggest that the Dragon Bloodline had forgiven the treachery ofCharlemagne's fathers, and reconciled his House with the Merovingian Kings whohad established it, by which they had effectively been betrayed as a result ofthe cunning wiles of the Roman Church. I doubt it though. Charlemagne was a Merovingian caught at the back end of a dynastic reshuffle notunlike many other Merovingian dynastic reshuffles. Essentially his wasfractionally the blood of the Grail and the Dragon, but the spirit of his housewas slowly being twisted and condemned to servitude under a religion whichclaims him as being one of its greatest champions. Similarly it claimed that hispredecessor, Constantine, took a timely baptism on his deathbed. It should benoted that history is written by the victors, and in retrospect the victors,from our point of view, have been the Church who rewrote history time and timeagain to suit their own ambitions. Charlemagne belongs, if anywhere, to a variation of the Grail myth known as theRing Cycle. Although Charlemagne is hailed as a hero of the Catholic faith he,like others who proceeded him, has what the Church might consider to be a darkundercurrent to his nature. On the surface he is a Christian emperor but evenso, he accepts from a “Dragon” the gift of a Ring which, not unlike those ofSolomon, was regarded by the Church as a symbol of Satan. The Ring of Power, the Alchemist's Oroborus, was the figure of a Dragon orSerpent encurved into a circle and set in the act of biting its own tail. It wasthe symbol both of eternity and, as the symbol of primordial chaos, the DragonRing also represented Tiamat, the mother of Anu, the Nephilim and the Titans. From these ancient Deific Rulers descended Lilith and Samael and the Race ofCain and Ham, the archenemies of the Church and, as they would have it, thearchenemies of Man. The story of Charlemagne's Dragon Ring, rather than beingallowed to stand unmolested, has become something of a morality tale. To removethe dark undercurrent and remove any doubt that Charlemagne was the Church'sbiggest supporter, the tale features a Merlin/Friar Tuck/Judas Priest figurecalled Bishop Turpin who, seeing that Charlemagne has become obsessed with thering, steals it and throws it into a lake. This he does for Charlemagne's owngood, you understand, and not in any way to: a) pervert Charlemagne's attention from his true origins in order that heconcentrate more on being a Christian, or b) rob Charlemagne of a traditional Druidic source of power and divination,which were the functions of Solomon's Dragon Rings. Of course not. Turpin was thinking solely of the good of his friend and actedentirely out of altruism for the Emperor. Having thrown the ring in a lake, thestory twists upon itself again and recounts that Charlemagne was led, as if byspirits, to the very same lake, with which he became inexplicably obsessed tosuch a degree that he built a palace next to it. If anything, the story illustrates that those of the Dragon Blood cannot denytheir heritage, which eventually will find them, despite what they believe orwhere they are situated geographically or socially. Even if that heritage is“stolen” or discarded, it will still be there in the pool of the subconscious.Because it is genetic, once it is switched on it can never be completelyswitched off again, however much ridicule, disbelief or hostility it engendersfrom within or without. The Church heard about Charlemagne's ring and stole it, but he never abandonedit or the heritage it represented, so the Church recounts that this Evil Ringobsessed him until the end of his days. Canines and feeding troughs come tomind. This story belongs to the Ring Cycle which inspired Tolkien, whounfortunately has inverted the Ring in much the same way as the Church did. Tolkien's characters nevertheless are taken from the Dragon and Grail Familieswho, like Robin Hood, actually existed in one form or another. The Ring ofPower, the Dragon and the Grail are exactly one and the same female symbol ofsovereignty, nurture and subsequent transcendence, hence the never-ending circleof eternity and the joyous chaos of the unlabelled, unnamed and undefined thatTiamat really stands for. Language creates structure, relatedness and psychological order which we thinkof as reality. The sequential nature of language and thought create time, buteternity is beyond time and consequently beyond thought. If eternity is beyondthought and its paranoid obsession with order, then eternity must be chaos. The Ring equates with the well and the fountain deep within the maze hidden atthe centre of the dark, mysterious forest. Guarded by a water nymph or DragonMaiden, the flow of this fountain and the waters of this well bring union withthe eternal, heal the divisions within the mind and bestow revelation. With astill mind the supplicant of the Maid feels the surge of power released and thegift of wisdom revealed. At one with themselves and consequently with the Godhead and the source of allpower, they understand themselves to be the centre and source of all things. Inthis revelation there is obtained absolute Sovereignty over selves, which itselfbecomes Sovereignty. The Dragon that bestowed the ring on Charlemagne was Frastrada the Fairy. LikeTiamat, Lilith, Tamaris, Sheba, Diana, Arduin, Brigid, Lamia, Janet ofCarterhaugh, Gwenhyfar, Pressina and Melusine, Frastrada was a Dragon Princessand a Grail Maiden. She is a Mary Magdalene and a Maid Marion. Without these Queens and Princesses, none of the Kings associated with themthroughout history would have been fit to reign. It is only she who can bestowthe gift that brings sovereignty. As transcendence and creativity, it bestowsblessing and fertility upon the kingdom through a wisdom and depth of visionthat anticipates difficulty and initiates productivity through activity. Forany, apart from the King and Queen, it would appear totally uncausative. Throughthe ability to see situations several steps down the line, they are able to planahead and bring blessings upon the land and the people. For this reason patriarchal religions hate women. Like little boys trying to befree of Mummy's apron strings, they deride the female for her authority. TheChurch is fully aware of the regal identity of the Dragon Kings and of the powerof the Grail Princesses through whom and by whom those Kings reigned. For thisreason the Inquisition was particularly directed against specific females. Puffed up with male pride and misogyny, the Church fully knew and hated the factthat beneath the symbol of the Lamia lay the truth of a distinct neurologicaldifference between not only Fairy women, but Fairy men as well. The DragonPrincesses produced a chemical that acted on their own physiology to produce astate of mental composure and grace that history symbolised as the Swan, notonly because of their elegance, but also to denote the origin in the anatomy ofthat chemical. The consequent state of grace produced by this chemical and the energy itafforded, uninhibited or wasted by any preoccupation with stress or innerconflict, appeared to make the female glow with an inner serenity and beautythat many people described as Fairy Fascination. The state of peace that they enjoyed was, to an ordinary careworn observer,utterly alluring and charming, a quality to adore because in proximity to herthe energy could be felt like soft electricity which had a calmative affect onthe mind. As it slowed down and became still, it began to perceive the joy andsense of oneness that has no beginning, no cause and no ending but lies hiddenbehind the internal barriers, taboos, fears and attachments that we use all ourmental energy to sustain in our minds. Usually this, when quite exhausted, hasno energy to spare to see beyond the tired struggle with imposed illusions. Inher company the observer would partake of her abundant morphic energy whichcould provide the observer with enough energy to see beyond and begin tounderstand that mortal care is unimportant. A mind thus stilled glimpses theeternal and this is one aspect of Hierogamy and the Love that is Death. The chemical also has a physical affect when transferred to the observer. Thesame stillness occurs and produces psychotropic effects. The problem was,though, that the observer would have to have sufficient numbers of the correctaxon membranes in the right type of synaptic receptors and an increased numberof dendrites connecting the appropriate brain cells across both hemispheres. Inother words the Dragon Princess had round pegs and Dragon Kings had lots ofround holes, in contrast to non-Dragons, who seemed to have different shapedpegs and holes, and less of either. The Church hated the fact that they couldn't use the “Magic” so they attemptedto destroy it so that no one else could use it either. This they hoped wouldresult in a level playing field where the glaring stupidity of their ownmonarchic clients wouldn't be noticed in comparison to the hopefullyexterminated and thus unobservable wisdom of the true Fairy Kings. It would also appear that the Church knew that the Fey, or Fairies, because theyparticipated in the eternal spirit of the One, were themselves eternal, needingno forgiveness—for sins they transcended—and no priest to intercede for them toa god whose spirit they were at one with. The Fey knew salvation was chemicaland physiological, being determined on the ability of the mind-brain to perceivethe eternal mind of the Cosmos and join with it. With their inherited naturalbody chemistry they were predisposed towards the ability to negate the ego. Theycould see beyond time and tide and understand that their individualconsciousnesses or spirits weren't individual or personal at all, but aspects ofthe one consciousness, which was eternal and did not require the salvationalministry of a Church that was run by the living dead. Worst of all, the Dragon Queens and Kings, not being descended from Adam andEve, completely bypassed the absolutely farcical doctrine of “Original Sin”, thelinchpin of the Church's contrived raison d'etre. Without Original Sin therecould be no subsequent Sin and if there was no subsequent Sin there was no needfor salvation. If there was no need for salvation for a people who could seebeyond the contrived notions of good and evil and therefore could not beblackmailed into paying into the Church's spiritual protection racket, thesepeople and their culture represented a threat to the profit margins of theprelates. The Church couldn't exploit what the Fey had and they feared what theFey instilled in their client tribespeople and communities. Therefore the Fey had to be eliminated in order for the Church to take over thecommunities and instil into them the kind of guilt and fear that encouragesconverts who can then be transformed into a pliant, captive consumer workforce.The Church recognised the problem and began a gradual process of demonisation,marginalisation, genocide and finally academic ridicule and incredulity.

Every month a nut drops from a tree that growsover the well and this blood red fruit is consumed by the Salmon.” The Druids who concocted these riddles were wise enough to know that Salmondidn't live in wells. If they'd meant “underground river”, they would have said:“the Salmon of Knowledge occasionally happens to swim to exactly the right spotto catch a fruit that isn't even part of its normal diet. However, all the same,it will navigate thousands of miles just in order to flounder about in the dark,waiting under a bore-hole, for an alien and indigestible titbit”. The Salmon ofStupidity? Anyone who seeks a plausible answer to this riddle based on matter of fact,reasonable explanations has probably eaten a sizeable lunch portion of the veryfish whose behaviour and habitat they are attempting to rationalise. The Salmon of Knowledge therefore is not a fish. If one takes a whole salmon andcleanly slits its belly open and removes the lights, then spreads thereddish-pink flesh apart to form an oval shape, it is reminiscent of somethingor another, I'm sure. As the fresh meat bleeds under the knife, one also bringsto mind the Blood Red Nut that the Salmon purportedly finds so irresistible.What is a nut? It is a seed, a beginning to new life, very much like an eggwhich, coloured red, is the object being held by a beautiful Mary Magdalene,whose pretty lips are slightly upcurved into a subtle, knowing smile which, itappears, is fully intended to taunt and infuriate! By wisdom a Fish may become aFlower that begets a Flower. The allegory of the well appears in the Song of Solomon, the Annals of IrishHistory and the Story of the Winning of the Elven Lover—Tam Lin (ThomasLindsay), by Lady Janet of Carterhaugh. It is fascinating that the Scythians and Jews have so many symbols andallegories in common with regard to the Holy Grail. The Scythian Gaels sharewith the Jews not only the symbol of the Well in the Garden or Forest with theFountain, but also the Salmon which, in the Judeo-Christian tradition becomesthe Christ, the Ichthys. By this means, Christ, his body and blood, shed for theremission of sins, becomes altogether a deeper allegory and his virgin birthfinds echoes in the Lily of the Valley and the Rose of Sharon. There is no doubt that Christ existed as a living being. However, he was aDragon King of the Grail Bloodline and many of the stories associated withChrist are Rosicrucian and Alchemical. The salvation that he preached to hisdisciples was not obtained through faith, but knowledge or gnosis, and thatknowledge is woven into the parables he told and the stories associated with himand with his close Royal cousins, the Sidhe of Ireland and Albany. Indeed the Grail stories of the Gaels precede Christ by centuries and indicatethat Christ was one amongst a long succession of Priest Kings whose teachings hetoo, in his turn, expounded. Jesus' teachings and the stories surrounding himdid not come into being with his arrival into this life but were part of anyalready extant corpus of secret knowledge which had been held in common by theHoly and Royal families of Eurasia for millennia. There are corresponding subtexts and symbols beneath the stories of Jesus'virgin birth, his life and death. Rather than being part of a lineal account ofhis unfolding qualities and exploits, they are references to the nature andquality of his, but more particularly, of his mother's blood and its dynamic. Inthis manner Christ himself becomes an allegory of the blood's qualities andpotential. a) If Christ is the Ichthys, related to the Salmon of Nechtan, then the bloodof Christ shed for the remission of sins is the blood not of Jesus, but of theMessiah, the Messe or Dragon Kings, shed by the Salmon. b) This Salmon lies at the bottom of a well which in the Gaelic and Frankishtales (cf. Melusine) is guarded by the Dragon Maiden. However, in the Song ofSolomon it is the Maiden herself who is identified as “The Shunnamite”, Sheba,the virgin child bride and sister of Solomon, who corresponds to both the VirginMary and Mary Magdalene in the New Testament. c) The virgin birth of the son of God, “the seed of David” is symbolised by theMagdalene presenting the blood red egg. The egg is the son of God and the seedof David which, as the nut from the tree over the well, is consumed and retainedwithin the salmon which represents the vulva that resides beneath the womb orwell. “Christ” simply means anointed one and derives from Messe, the act ofanointing a Dragon Queen or King with the fat of the Sobekh or Water Dragon(crocodile). By understanding the dual meaning of Ichthys we comprehend thatIchthys as both Christ (anointed-messe) and salmon (fish) means “anointed Vulvaof the Dragon Princess”. This means that her womb gives issue to the seed of godwhich is held in the virgin vulva (christ) which sheds its blood, and the seed,for the salvation of man. The body (ova) and blood (menses) of Christ (thesacred womb). d) The anointed vulva can be found in the Song of Solomon. “My hands are on thelock of the door, my fingers drip with Myrrh”—Sheba. The act of anointingsignifies sacredness and holiness, that someone or something is set aside forsome sole Holy Purpose. The anointed Vulva/Womb that itself anoints is set asidefor a higher purpose than mere procreation. It is the Holy Virgin Grail whichcontains the Blood of Christ, the Blood of the Messiahs or Dragon Kings andQueens. The Virgin Birth was not a child, but a seed of a child. Christ’s (theVulva's) sacrifice of its body and blood for the salvation of man was the“birth” or flowing forth of the spent ova in the menses which, in the Eucharist,is symbolised by the Bread and Wine. This, as we all know, must be consumed. "},{"pageContent":"[images/00034.jpg]Chapter 17 The Little Nut Tree The nut or seed which falls from the tree is properly the release of thechemical melatonin by the pineal gland. It overrides oestrogen and causes the“seed” to be discarded in the menstrual blood. This contains a naturallyincreased level of that chemical, which is what the story is really getting at.In the Song of Solomon, Sheba says that she will give Solomon the juice of herPomegranate to drink. This is a symbol used repeatedly to represent the virginfemale organs of which juice: Blood, is the red wine of the Pomegranate. “I had a little nut tree, nothing would it bear,But a Silver Nutmeg and a “Golden Pear”,The King of Spain's daughter came to visit me,and all for the sake of my little nut tree”. Beneath the political allegory concerning the proposed marital alliance betweenCatharine of Aragon and Henry Tudor, there lies another alchemical message. The Badge of Aragon is the Golden Pear or Pomegranate. On Card II of the MajorArcana of the Waite Tarot: The High Priestess, is a veil symbolising the virginhymen. Printed on the veil are rows of pomegranates which in turn also symbolisethe virgin vulva. The High Priestess is the guardian of wisdom and the“mysteries”. The palm fronds interspersing the pomegranates on the veil represent the palmtrees that grow next to the pools in desert oases and equate with the nut treein the story of the “Well of Nechtan”. These palm trees lent their name to aspecies of Holy Virgin Princess who bestowed upon the King the right to rule.Their category was “Tamaris” and Jesus' daughter bore that name and title. InSufism the Tree of Life is represented as a palm tree atop of which is perched apeacock. In the Welsh and Irish Tales the bird is an eagle, whilst in HinduTantra the bird is a Swan. In the popular nursery song quoted, the nutmeg symbolises the pineal gland whosecolour silver equates with the Moon and Diana, representing the virginhuntress's “moon” or menstrual blood. In Ephesus, Diana is depicted riding apanther. This means that the Panther clan carries her qualities—holy andtherefore very special “Moon” blood. Jesus', and therefore, in anglicised form,Mary's family name was Ben Panther, or “sons of the Panther”. In mythology thisis interchangeable with the werewolf and was born by the Plantagenets as theirfamily badge. The nutmeg itself is known to be a powerful psychotropic drug. This has recentlybeen synthesised as MDMA or Ecstasy. The story relates that the chemicaldischarged into the bloodstream by the pineal gland has psychotropic propertieswhen processed via certain exercises relating to the Tree of Life. The nut tree, the palm tree and most other fruiting trees can be said torepresent the Tree of Life, but the sovereign of all these is the Apple ofAvalon. If the well and the salmon symbolise the womb and the vagina, belowwhich is the vulva, the tree growing next to the Well represents the lower andupper torso, the head and the arms of the Virgin female. The twigs and branchesof the tree symbolise the veins and arteries of rich, Holy Royal Blood and thefruits of the tree represent the endocrinal glands that correspond to theChakras in Tantrism, the Sephira in Cabala and the Nine Worlds in Vikingmythology. The tree is Jacob's Ladder or the Ladder of Lights. "},{"pageContent":"[images/00011.jpg] Chapter 18 The Rite of the Vampire The tantric/hermetic, Royal Rite of the Vampire can never be predatory orsexual. It does not indicate any form of Freudian psychosis and, although it isan expression of True Love, this does not correspond to any mundane romanticexpectations. Human love seems mostly needy, arising in response to a variety ofchemical and emotional deficits. Rather than transforming the couple involved,it simply seems to reinforce old complexes and prejudices, being entered into inthe hope of fulfilling preconceived expectations. Starfire cannot be achieved by partial individuals seeking some form of sociallyconditioned notional completeness through the other person. Both individualsmust have personal integrity in order to transcend the possibility of simplybecoming each other's other half. The whole realm of Starfire in its varyingmanifestations should be entered into without preconceptions and withoutemotional inadequacy. If there isn't a degree of prior individuation, then it does become just anothervariation on the theme of Freudian domination and the desire for personal powerthrough the sexual victimisation of another person. In itself, Starfire isDeath, the journey's end. Its symbolic expression is best appreciated in Waite'sTwo of Cups. It is a “Love which is not in Nature, but by which Nature isSanctified”. As the Rite of Quickening, it often happens at its greatestintensity when it is least expected to happen and the individual/s involved haveno foreknowledge of it. The endocrinal glands tend to be multi-functional, with more than just one glandbeing responsible for the production of a single hormone or neurotransmitter.The endocrinal system is fantastically complex and operates on a feedback loopof constantly changing levels of hormones, interacting and affecting each otherin order to maintain a delicate balance. It would require a separate book to attempt to give a full explanation of theStarfire Ritual in anatomical and physiological terms. Therefore, I shallrestrict the discussion to those glands and organs directly associated with thepsychosomatic Sephira system. This stimulates the production of the hormonesmost closely identified with Starfire, the Holy Grail and Vampire Lore. Firstlyhowever it is worth defining the objectives of undertaking the Rite of theVampire. These are: 1) To enhance intelligence2) To promote longevity IntelligenceIntelligence in cybernetic terms is defined as “The ability of an organism toexist and develop in symbiosis with its environment”. The Rite of the Vampirewas, in classical terms, a Royal prerogative which was undertaken on a regularbasis with selected partners in order to promote within the reigning Queen orKing a sequence of events leading to transcendent intelligence. Originating in Scythian Royal Families, the Rite of the Vampire enabled theQueen to maintain and the King to obtain sovereignty, firstly over themselves,and secondly over the destiny which affected the people whom they served andguided. Whilst the Queen could reign independently, it was thought by theancients that a King could not be a King without a Queen. In modern everydayterms this idea has a sound basis in the difference between male and femalephysiology, which difference in part is reflected in, and was balanced out by,the Rite of the Vampire. In the ancient world the caste system defined the tasks of every individualwithin society. The Royal family was the nation's spirit, soul and mind, thewarriors were its arms, the yeomen and artisans were its torso and its legs.Each caste performed its specific tasks and relied upon the other for direction,sustenance and defence. Each caste was considered as vital as the other in thetask of maintaining the nation as a whole. Today the nations are being run byfools. The task of the Royal Family was to guide and direct the efforts of the othercastes. It could only do this efficiently if it was psychologically healthy andpossessed of a considerable degree of wisdom and farsightedness. Its specifictask was to foresee future problems and benefits and direct the nationaccordingly. To be able to exercise this amount of sovereign control over destiny, they firsthad to ensure sovereignty within themselves. This entailed adopting a practical,consistent method of integrating all the aspects of the psyche, by uniting andenhancing communication between the various areas of the brain contained withinthe general divisions of the left and right cerebral lobes. This task was notachieved by lengthy selves-analysis or psychotherapy, but simply by ingestingchemicals which would encourage a greater sense of union within selves. In thisway a transcendent appreciation of the selves' union with the Mind of Godhead orthe Universe came about. Thereby true sovereignty, the will of the One, could beintegrated into the mind of the Royal seer and followed. Within the mind are a host of barriers, many of which are caused by the brain'schemical and physical inability to communicate efficiently with itself. Thiscauses a sense of confusion and isolation which encourages the spectrum ofvarious forms to appear, from attachment to comforting delusions. Sovereigntyover selves is attained by accepting the selves for what they are. In so doingthe individual, dispensing with the energy-consuming need to erect and maintaindefensive mental routines, allows the truth to prevail instead, without regretand without judgement. In this manner the mind becomes detached and observant. The energy formally used to sustain defensive mechanisms and constellations ofdelusory complexes is freed from its shackles and can be used to enhancealertness and perception. In focused attention, there is discovered truth andthis is the greatest manifestation of intelligence. Symbiosis is— above allelse—harmony and harmony is transcendence. As a result of the Rite of theVampire, Scythian culture itself was rooted in the love of truth and honour. Theharmony they experienced within themselves as a result of their personal honestyaffected their relationship with the natural world which they adored.Correspondingly they lived in harmony and symbiosis with the natural world. Forthe Scythian, who had an almost childlike love of life, dishonesty was the enemyof joy and the death of clarity. In consequence it was said of the Scythian Royal caste that they hated usurers,merchants and tradesmen and abhorred the deceit of the marketplace. Above all,the Royal Scythian knew transcendent reality, and was able not only to read hisor her own heart and mind, but those of other men. Therefore anyone attemptingto lie to them or deceive them was proffering the greatest of insults andappeared to be turning the universe upside down and perverting the Harmony ofthe Natural Order of life itself. In Gothic romance we have a particularly apposite example of the Scythian hatredof liars and cheats. It depicts the Scythian “Vampire” as living in terror ofthe Christian cross and holy water. Therefore we are fooled into believing thatthe Vampire was an evil denizen of Hell who cannot bear to look upon or comeinto contact with the greatest of all the symbols of virtue and righteousness.However the reverse is actually the case. Because of the intent of those whohave stolen it, the Christian cross to a “Vampire” was the epitome of everythingthat is evil, malicious, selves-serving, deceitful, dishonest and corrupt. Tothe “Vampire”, the Church consisted of individuals who were no better thanracketeers and murderers. They were tradesmen and usurpers. The Vampire's reaction to the cross was not holy terror but disgust andcontempt. This was compounded by insult if the cross were wielded by a cleric,because to the Vampire the cross was also associated with the martyrdom of oneof the Family. To use a Vampire family symbol to ward off a Vampire was theultimate insult to the Vampire's intelligence. Likewise with holy water. In themedieval romances dire warnings are issued to those who would pour water uponthe cubic stone of the Holy Grail. Such an act would bring down thunder and lightning on the head of thetransgressor. This symbolism indicates that the stone that pours forth thewaters of life, namely the Grail Maiden, should not be baptised. Such aChristian act is an act of usurpation, which is viewed by the Dragon Bloodlinesin much the same way as anyone else would view the person that writes graffition an historically significant building. Christian clerics are usurpers and the act of sprinkling with holy water istaken as their arrogance and audacity in attempting to make their own, somethingthey can never possess or use to further their own selfish, materialisticdesires. The Vampire race did not live in fear of idolatrous trinkets, it viewedthem with anger and contempt as a form of utter stupidity that insults theintellect. To return to the central theme of the narrative, the achieving of internal unionwas a fairly straightforward and predictable event. This is because the RoyalScythians, the Vampire or Elven Kings and Queens originated from a bloodlinethat had specific physiological differences in comparison to other humanspecies. Principally, as stated, they were in possession of a greater number ofmelatonin-sensitive synaptic receptors on both sides of the brain than ordinaryhuman beings. Secondly, they possessed also a greater number of axons uniting the right andleft lobes of the brain via the corpus callosum. This allowed for an enhancedtrans-lobal communication potential. Thirdly, both male and female “Vampires”had larger pineal glands than other people. In Vampire culture these assertionsare reflected in the symbolism they used. The synaptic and axonal connections via the corpus callosum were represented bythe image of the Dove of the Holy Spirit descending, holding within its beak apaten which it intends to insert into a Grail Cup. This was a medieval Templarsymbol. The wings of the Dove represent the axon branches of the limbic systemof the left and right cerebrum, whilst the body of the Dove represents thecorpus callosum which joins the two halves together. Similarly, the Aryan symbol of the Swan displayed also takes the trouble toemphasise the same assertion but rather uses the Swan's head to distinguish theposition of the pineal gland. Both birds are used to convey a sense of grace andserenity and the observer is encouraged to associate such states with thepsychic condition of the Dragon Grail Bloodline, arising specifically fromneurophysiological differences between that bloodline and the rest of humanity. Differences in sensitivity to psychic or physical stimulus between the ancientScythian Royal caste and other castes is emphasised in the West by the tale ofThe Princess and the Pea. This story has a variant in Hinduism which itselfshares a common Aryan cultural root with the Scythians. Here the differencebetween a Brahmin and a Ksatriya attracts comment, and it becomes clear that atendency towards heightened physical sensitivity distinguishes the Royal Priestfrom the Noble Warrior. One is quite clearly encouraged to associate castedifference with physical difference and conclude that caste was not a matter ofsocial status but of physical and psychological function. The Priest was bred tobe physically different to the Warrior. The “Vampire” was born with a higher potential for perception, transcendence andintelligence. Although operating on a higher base line in these areas than otherspecies, the Vampire race in their own perception of their everydaypsychological and physiological condition, occupied a functional norm. Theywalked a tightrope between their own mundanity, which for others would beperceived as being transcendent, and an even higher state of being. Because of the neurophysiological variations, achieving such a state would bequite a straightforward matter of ingesting certain neurotransmitters andhormones within the correct environmental conditions. Having so many moresynapses and axons to accommodate these chemicals than other human beings, justa slight push could send them over the edge of their accepted reality and intoanother level of the universe. A homeopathic dose would allow them to achieve critical mass, whilst in others,much larger doses would have no affect at all because there are not the numberof axons connecting the two lobes anyway. A simple example of this oddphenomenon is that many devotees of various faiths follow gurus, attend seminarsand retreats, or take drugs. Despite this, however, even after years ofstruggle, yearning and discipline, they get nowhere near attaining any state ofmind that might be termed transcendent or intelligent according to theparameters defined herein. Society encourages us to believe that we are all a homogenous mean, we are allbuilt the same and we all share equal and similar attributes and potentials. TheChurch in particular is still very keen to push this particular piece ofpropaganda. This is, of course, blatantly untrue but those who are unaware ofthe physiological differences may strive for years in a state of utterperplexity, attempting to fulfil the desire to become enlightened. Such perplexity is compounded when they meet others who make no attempt at allto achieve such a coveted state but simply live in it daily, having been born toit. Transcendence isn't a matter of getting a load of exercises right. It's amatter of being born with the kind of brain, endocrinal system and geneticmemory that allows the mind to perceive such a state of being. Being a Witch, magician, Vampire, Fairy or a Royal Dragon is not something thatcan be bestowed through rites of initiation or by adopting the pose. Such beingsare of a different race, a race into which they are born. It is not a club thatpeople can join and there are no human equivalents or substitutes. Even thoughthe Church has attempted to usurp the status and power of these beings, theutter mess they have made of life on Earth just goes to prove my point. They have usurped the positions formerly occupied by the transcendent. Lackingboth the tools to perform the task and the innate desire to accept the “Oblige”which goes with the “Noblesse”, they have stupidly and callously raped theplanet and wiped out thousands of its precious species, bringing the worlditself to the brink of disaster. The “Vampire” was bred, with man's collusion,to be man's natural overlord and was born with that transcendent potential whichwas an essential part of the employment requirement for Kings and Queens. LongevityThis aspect of the Rite of the Vampire has two subtexts, the physical and thespiritual. The former, in social terms, was intended to establish a sense ofcontinuity and consistency to the reign of a King or Queen. The latter isdetermined by the phenomenon of transcendent understanding. By performing theRite of Starfire regularly, it was possible to extend the normal span of life upto about one third. Although the legend of the Vampire having eternal life canbe said to be true, it does not relate to physical life. The Vampire is to allintents and purposes dead in one sense but far more alive than ordinary humanbeings in another. There are two types of life. Both depend upon one’s state of perception fortheir true appreciation. In Stoker's Dracula we are introduced to the idea thatDracula's image is not reflected in any mirror. Later on, towards the end of thetale the Count says to Mina Harker, “There is no life in this body”. The formerincident explains the latter statement. It is expressed eloquently elsewhere: “Be dead to the old nature and alive tothe new.” Jesus taught that there were two types of life, one mundane and theother transcendent. The old nature, the old life, is lived in relation to itsenvironment and the opinion of those around it. It is bound by taboo andmorality and considers itself the only reality. This is the ego, the individual, unregenerate personality. Being a component ofthe brain's function, it dies with the body. The ego or personality is a safetyfunction, a minor form of selves-awareness that is formed by memory. In a sense,like memory, it is a quality of the past and in its functioning it relates allnew experience to past memory in order to quantify the threat or potential ofany newly experienced phenomena. In so doing, it does not observe the new but makes of it the old, by comparingit to the nearest similar previous experience. Therefore as the ego isessentially memory, and memory is the past, and the past is dead and gone, sotoo is the human personality. Human beings are, to all intents and purposes,machines, and they are truly the living dead. The ego or personality, that is,all that human beings think of within themselves as being alive, is founded uponfear. During the process of quickening the transcending mind, fear begins toappreciate that it is beginning to disintegrate. It is dying. As fear dies, the memory, which formerly prevented the perception from seeinganything new, suddenly sees all things anew. As memory is also the principalcomponent of time, then what the perception also observes for the first time isthe end of time: eternity. What is left after the mind dies is the eternal, thegreater being, the spirit of the universe: life itself. From that point onwards memory is founded not on fear but upon understanding.What lives from then onwards is the eternal perceiving itself through the sensesof the Vampire. The former “personality” is dead. In terms that human beingswould understand “There is no life in this body”, that is, no fixed or immutablepoint of reference. This was why Dracula cast no reflection in the mirror. Theface, the body, is what human beings think of when they affirm to themselvestheir selveshood. Being shaped by the personality, the body becomes the ego, theI. The symbolic absence of a reflection is intended to assert that Dracula, and“Vampires” in general, are “dead to the old nature but alive to the new”. Thisis the foundation upon which Jesus' entire message was built. It is only theVampire that can truly say, with the voice of the eternal, “I AM THE TRUTH, THEWAY AND THE LIFE”. For it is only in the blood of the Vampire that there can befound the secret of eternal life. Did Vampires have eternal life? Well, yes they did. They were born Eternal inthe sense that they were born to be transcendent and their Rites afforded themthe ability to “yield” to the transcendent dynamic and perceive eternity. Fromthat point on, time becomes less relevant and they never departed from theeternal now that is perceived whilst in this physical life. Time is created by the mind, which is fear. Without fear there is no time.Whilst living in the physical body, Vampires perceive their mortal lives asimmortal. So in the time it takes for a mortal to live out his natural life, theVampire has already lived an eternity in the same space of years. When a Vampirebody dies, the spirit lives on because it is the spirit of the eternal. The greatest heresy of all for the Church is that it cannot ever achieve foritself or bestow upon others the ability to attain life after death. Thegreatest heresy is that humans die, whilst the Vampire and the Fairy liveforever. The greatest lie that the Church has ever uttered is in trying toconvince people that faith or transubstantiation in communion will grant eternallife. Even if the blood in the Eucharist Chalice were the blood of Christ or theVirgin, it would avail Man nothing because he is not anatomically equipped toprocess the chemicals that allow the brain to see the eternal. Mortal man isequipped to live his allotted span and then die forever. Individualreincarnation of the personality is equally as spurious a lie which, like theChurch's teachings concerning life after death, is propagated to inducebehavioural conformity. However, there are still Grail Maidens on the Earth andthe spirit of Kali has not yet completely passed into oblivion, despite the bestefforts of the Church to breed her handmaidens out of existence. We are all encouraged to conform. We have our expectations regulatedaccordingly. In particular, no one in the West is taught that there is a dynamicpotential within human relationships which transcends the mundane desire toassuage loneliness or greed, to propagate the genes, replicate the selves orachieve selves-worth through sexuality. In consequence, those who have beentaught that Dragons, Vampires, Witches, Fairies or Druidhes do not exist, andfurthermore that all are sons of Adam and thus born equal in the sight of God,can be surprised by the startling effects on the soul of Starfire, as theQuickening. A new reality manifests itself. The brain becomes sensitised to the chemicalphenomena that accompany the revolution in perception and this new state becomesthe norm, the base line. To maintain it, Starfire, as a ritual, must becontinued. There is now a new physiological requirement that must be met that isbeyond human understanding, because human beings are blessedly bereft of thedormant brain function that is now fully operational and has become addicted toLa Fontaine de Soif. It should be explained that Starfire does not necessarily have to be theconsumption of blood in the first instance. As the Quickening it can sometimesoccur in the Grail Bloodline spontaneously and unexpectedly. It can involvesomeone in a situation in which they become aware of a tremendous level ofenergy in a person they meet, and become close to. This energy field, in closeproximity, does something to the subject's perceptions. There can be a feelingof tremendous stillness and peace and a cessation of desire. It is like Death. The only way to explain it is to say that it appears to rewire the brain whichthen subconsciously expects a continuity of that selvessame stimulus. Without aregular fix there can be problems. It all sounds like the nonsense we read inGothic novels, like some form of stereotypical motif that wouldbe Vampires woulduse to justify the idiocy of being seen in public with orthodonticaugmentations. However, La Fontaine de Soif does exist. The best way of understanding it is tothink of the alcoholic who, before the first drink doesn't even know that s/heis an alcoholic. However, afterwards s/he needs that chemical fix regularly ortheir life goes to pieces. In alcoholism the chemical deficiency is, I believe,for a neurotransmitter called neuropeptide. In vampirism it is for melatonin,but that in itself is only one component. Prolactin, oxytocin, vassopresin anddopamine could also be implicated in the dependence. A happy Dragon can go through life without any of this and without any of theGothic overtones, just as long as they never meet another one of theirbloodline. If they do though, there is a chance that they will discover aseparate reality which they will find painful to lose. When talking of Royal Vampirism, one should be aiming to associate the phrasewith the evening scent of nightstock, with moonlight and starshine, and the songof the nightingale in the forest behind the rose-walk. “In the centre of the chamomile lawn there stands a black marble plinth frombeneath which trickles the waters of life, whose sparkling melody harmoniseswith the plaintive haunting song of the beautiful, Elven girl, the beloved who,leaning against the monolith, stares into the starlit western sky, as ifsurveying a vast abyss, a realm of infinite depth that no man could ever hope tosee with human eyes”. She is the journey's end and the fulfilment of the Dragon nature. Royalvampirism is about devotion to the feminine and surrender to the goddess; it isabout a love that sacrifices selves even unto death. It cannot be presentedwithout the kind of romantic imagery whose symbolism transcends mortal love.Here we have a situation where the sidhe, in order to consummate his or hernature, must sacrifice that nature to the source of its consummation. The DragonMaiden is not the victim and the Vampire is not the predator. Both consume andtransform each other and ultimately the sidhe must die in the arms of thebeloved. The confusion between this imagery and that of the dentally gifted fashionvictim is the confusion between royal and martial vampirism. This particularmanifestation of the legend was real and there is no getting away from that.Like Royal Vampirism, it concerned itself with the assimilation of identities,but beyond that it was for adrenaline and thyroxine addicts. Originating inScythian battle custom, warriors would drink the blood of fallen friend or foealike in order to take upon themselves the valour and spirit of the dyingwarrior. The more adrenaline and endorphins the victim or donor had in their bloodstreamthe better, because this provided fuel for the predators to continue the fray.It did not concern itself with high philosophy, transcendent love, intelligenceor longevity and was itself in effect a short cut to the grave. A case of livehard, die young. Today athletes have been known to gradually extract their ownblood, up to about two pints, and store it prior to events. Several hours beforetheir performance they would re-inject the blood back into their systems, givingthem a significant and very useful lift. In stories such as le Fanu's Carmilla, Stoker's Dracula and lately the work ofWarrington, the most significant component of the Vampire's personality is notthe callousness or predation, but their adoration and love for the victim. Themethod of consummation, however, has been confused with that of the ScythianWarrior. Having said that, the stories themselves echo significantly thesentiments expressed in the world's first story of royal vampirism, the Song ofSongs, to be given further consideration in relating and expanding upon theunderlying theme in historical examples of the Royal Rite. StarfireIs Milis Fola Namhaid—Ach Is Milse Fuil Caraid —Motto of the Dragon Court and the Dragon descent of the RoyalHouse of Vere. Scythian-Gaelic, 5th-century AD The Ritual of the VampireTo prepare for this ritual, it took a subject six months to a year of consistentand methodical practice, undertaken daily, after dark. In the first few weeks ofher retreat on the “Isle of Women” (Avalon) she would have been guided by anolder companion, a Druidess or shamanka. The entire procedure was thensummarised and condensed by using a series of Hermetic signatures or gestures asauto-suggestive prompts. The Rite was broken down into numbered steps. Themaiden decided on the type of gesture or verbal command, or both, and then usedthese at the beginning of each step. After methodical practice these promptsautomatically became associated with the steps by the subconscious which, oncommand, would initiate the dynamic associated with that particular verbalcommand or gesture or both. The aim of the exercise was to encourage the female to increase the amount ofmelatonin in her bloodstream prior to or during menstruation. The exercise orits glyph commands were also repeated on the night of the rite itself in orderto ensure the correct ionic polarity of the neurotransmitter being dischargedeither by the womb or the Graffenberg gland, which was stimulated manually tothe point of orgasm and ejaculation. A golden flute or pipe, inserted into the urethra prior to stimulation, waseither held in the mouth to receive the discharged glandular fluid, or otherwisedirected into a chalice. If blood was desired the Grail princess would positionherself over the mouth of the reclining recipient and allow gravity to take itsnatural course, aided by oral stimulation and the resulting uterinecontractions. The preliminary exercise required attention and was only to be practiced atnight. Likewise the fluids themselves were only collected at night becausedaylight to a large extent, prevents the manufacture of melatonin. To beginwith, the princess and her Druidess chose a chamber without light. If theexercise were being practiced today, ideally the space chosen would be free oflive electric cables or equipment, as electro-magnetic discharges affect thepineal gland, which is the command gland of the entire endocrinal system. It was also vital that this exercise never be conducted in daylight. To do sowould have resulted in the over production of seratonin which in certainrespects can be very dangerous. Once the exercise had become part of the mentallandscape, attention to such detail became less important. Relaxation andsilence were however, very important in order to avoid distraction. Theexperience was extremely pleasant when done correctly, but it took work. Modus OperandiThe energy centres lying idle within the morphic field of the body need a lot ofencouragement to come out of that dormant state, and it requires a great deal ofperseverance. Once they are established as a component of the conscious mindthey will work on the physical centres that they correspond to. This producessensations which, as they are the result of increased glandular function, cannotbe confused with wishful thinking or autosuggestion. Dragon Magic is the oldest magic in the world. Most other shamanic and ritualsystems are corruptions of it. Being the earliest, it is also the simplest andmost pure and arose at a time when religiosity and hocus pocus had yet tocripple man's mind. In Dragon Magic all phenomena are related primarily to theobserver of the phenomena and the observer's perceptions thereto are determinedby the condition of her or his hormonal balance. Our entire understanding of and relationship with the universe is governed byour body chemistry. Aware of this, old Dragons compiled a series of exercises towhich, of late, a vast amount of nonsense has been attached by people whoprobably refused to believe that it could be so simple. Magical ability ishereditary. Undoubtedly a great many dubious individuals have set themselves up asauthorities on Magic. Having tried it and having also failed miserably toachieve anything, they have deduced that the formulae were too simple andtherefore must be something lacking. It would not occur to them that it wasthey, and not the discipline, that lacked the vital components. In an attempt tomake simple, straightforward, workable Magic, over the centuries they and theirunderachieving successors have added to it layer upon layer of pointless,unnecessary junk. Adenosine triphosphate is the fuel that fires up the body cells. The electricaldischarge of these cells, along with the axonal discharge of the nerve channelswhich are comprised of these cells themselves, creates a morphic energy fieldaround and within the body. Its shape is maintained as a stable continuum by theDNA blueprint which determines the body's form. It was the naturally high strength of this field in the Fairy, emanating throughpale, translucent skin and the quality of poise and transcendent, swanlikeserenity that gave the Albe-gens; the Maidens of the Grail, the perceptible“glow” that earned them the Epithet “The Shining Ones”. The Flame of Life burnedbrighter in them. It is, however, possible to concentrate spheres of that energy in specific partsof the body at will. In this particular exercise the energy will be concentratedaround specific glands within the endocrinal system. What happens then is thatthe cells of these glands will be fed more energy than is usual, causing them towork at an increased rate. In Dragons it appears that a dormant facility for enabling energy to bemanipulated in this way does exist in their genetic memories unlike the geneticmemories of others. This means that they are more able than others to ignitethese spheres of energy, which in Tantra are called wheels or Chakras and inKabala are termed Sephira or Halos. The exercise will prove initially fruitless to any newcomer because it seeks tomake a warp in an energy field. This has, in the average individual, to allintents and purposes remained seated in a genetic armchair for aeons: it willhave metaphorical stiff joints at first, and until perseverance has rendered itsupple. During the period devoted to practice, diet is important. Try to avoid anythingthat will encourage the production of free radicals and eat plenty ofantioxidants like bananas, oranges, oats, tomatoes and so forth. The aim is tomake the exercise as easy as possible and food that stresses the glands or worksagainst them will have a deleterious effect on the health during this period.Eat plenty of garlic. It is an excellent antiseptic and blood cleanser. The PreparationHaving selected a quiet dark space that is warm, familiar and comfortable,ensure yourselves a period of time free from all and any distraction whatsoever.The bedroom is ideal. 1) Loosen all clothing or disrobe, and lie flat on your back on the bed withyour head cushioned at a low but comfortable angle. Place your arms by your sideor upon the tops of your thighs with your elbows resting on the bed. 2) Starting with your feet, stretch your toes and tense the muscles in theankles and then relax. Make a mental note of the sensation of tension andrelaxation and repeat the tensing and relaxing exercises for the calves, thighs,torso, neck, face and arms. Repeat this routine until you are familiar with thefeeling of being relaxed and then concentrate your attention on all the musclesof the body to ensure they are loose and unknotted. Once you are certain thatyou are completely relaxed make the gesture or think the command word which youwish to be associated with this relaxed state. 3) In a completely relaxed state, exhale completely but comfortably and breathein again, counting the seconds in your mind, until you are near capacity but notstraining or in discomfort. Breathe from the abdominal area not the chest. Takethe air in through the nose. Make a note of how many seconds it took to breathein, then hold the breathe for two seconds and breathe out through the mouthgently and slowly, taking the same amount of time to empty the lungs as it tookto nearly fill them. Once they are discharged, hold for two seconds and thenbreathe in again. Repeat this routine throughout the entire duration of theexercise. Adjusting the breathing to the frequency of the heartbeat helps agreat deal. After a while you no longer have to count but simply breathe evenlyin synchronisation with the heart. Continue to monitor your state of relaxationand adjust accordingly. After about ten minutes of relaxation and regularbreathing you will feel the affects of the oxygen in the blood acting on therelaxed muscles of the body. You will begin to feel a pleasant buzzing in thehead and a sense of weightlessness as if you are floating in mid air. When thishappens, make the gesture or think the command word you wish to be associatedwith this stage. If you get infuriating itches, scratch them and start again. Italways happens but as the exercise becomes more familiar, they subside. At this stage a rhythmic pattern of breathing has been established which enablesthe mind to relax and attune itself to the brain's cycles. What is beingattempted in the first few months is to establish a psychosomatic relationshipbetween mind and body which is conducive to enabling the mind to exercisecontrol over bodily systems which usually remain unconscious. By repeating therhythmic patterns faithfully the brain begins to associate the exercise withrelaxation and calm, which it will later habitually associate with the commandprompts. When this happens, each command prompt will trigger the correct bodilyresponse. Having established the relaxation and breathing exercises successfully it is nowtime to begin the visualisation process of the exercise. The aim ofvisualisation is to assert control of the mind over the body. An example of thisis that if you visualise in your mind the image of you eating a lemon, you willautomatically begin to salivate. This is mind over matter. This process isinvolved in concentrating energy into the gland centres associated with thedormant Sephira in order to awaken them. In the Rite of the Vampire there are five spheres which are utilised,corresponding to the brain and brain stem including the ventricals, the pinealgland, the pituitary gland, the hypothalamus, the thyroid and parathyroid glandsin the throat, and the Graffenberg gland and or womb. Starting from the top theyare the: > Name > Location > Resonant > Colour > Kether > Brain > Ti Ah Maat > White-Gold > Daath > Thyroid > Ah Nah Ouh > Mauve > Tiphareth > Thymus > Nin Kur Saag > Red > Yesod > Womb > Lih Lih Tou > Blue > Milathara > Graffenberg > Luh LuhAh > Green-Silver 4) As you lie with your eyes closed in a state of perfect relaxation begin tovisualise the first sphere in the column—Kether. About five inches in diameter,this ball of white light should be envisaged as occupying the space within thecranium. Imagine looking at the sun on a misty spring morning and this will giveyou the exact image. Whilst visualising Kether, imagine that from its centrethere is rolling a beautiful deep sonorous vibration similar to the haunting,unbelievably deep chanting of Tibetan Monks. As you are imaging the sphereglistening and glowing, and the three-syllable chant from the centre: TIR ARRHMAAT corresponds to the rhythm of your breathing out, you will begin to see inyour eyes a white light. You will feel your head humming in a way different fromthat caused by the breathing exercise. When this sphere has established itself,imagine that from its centre a cylindrical channel of white light has emergedand travelled down to your throat. Doing this will direct the pineal andpituitary secretions to the thyroids. 5) Maintaining the Kether sphere and the rod of light, now imagine a glisteningball of the same size in mauve around the throat and lower skull. In the samemanner as before, from its centre allow it to intone in your mind the chant AHHNAA OUU as one continuous sound. At this point, once it has become established,things get really interesting. The thyroid gland starts to produce an excess of thyroxine 4, which themelatonin from the pineal converts into thyroxine 3—Rocket Fuel. Within a matterof seconds this has entered the bloodstream and united with every cell in thebody. The feedback loop to the brain energises all the glands again and they inturn increase their output of hormones which increases the output and conversionof thyroxine 4, causing a snowball effect. At this point you will have forgotten to breathe, visualise or chant. Thethyroxine 3 has just united with the mitochondria to produce adenosinetriphosphate, which is now causing every cell in the body to behave like anuclear reactor. The weirdest sensation of all is caused by the boost of energyto the morphic field around the body. It begins to expand and appears to havejust developed nerve endings on its outer perimeter which now feels like anegg-shaped aura encapsulating the entire body. Whilst this is happening you feel bloated with energy like a balloon full ofwarm glowing water and most surprising of all is that you can actually see thecells glowing in your head. The discovery of an extra component to the humananatomy that you didn't previously know of or believe in can be a shock. Try notto forget the object of the exercise because it gets even better, especially forwomen. At this point remember to incorporate the command glyph or word. 6) After the initial surprise has worn off and the phenomenon has stabiliseditself, resume the breathing pattern and check for muscular relaxation. Havingrestored the breathing pattern imagine that the “channel of light” has extendeddown from the mauve Daath sphere around the throat and come to rest behind thesternum bone of the rib cage. Here you should visualise a redgold sphere thesame size as the former two, scintillating and pulsing. From its centre, listento its chant emanate. NING GURR SAARG. In all cases you should hear the chants,not in your head, but coming from the spheres. Direct the sound out as if itwere coming from there. The thymus stores the T-cells which help fight infectionand aid in the prevention of cellular damage. When the sphere has become stableand you can feel its warmth you will see in your mind that it is glowing withoutyour wilful act of imagination. At this point think the command word or gestureassociated with this stage. 7) Having accomplished this, imagine that the channel of white light isbreaking from the Tifaret sphere and reaching down to the womb. Now visualisethe womb being surrounded by a sphere of warm aquamarine light dappled like themoon reflected in water. The colour is vivid and opalescent. From the centre ofthe Sphere and the womb intone the chant LEER LEER TOO. As with all the spheres,remember that the chant begins at the peak point of the intake of breath andcontinues until exhalation is complete. It does not however break off abruptlyat that point, but continues to resonate until you breathe in again. Make thechants flow. Surprise Number Two. After a while the womb will begin to react andthe genital area will become sensate. As the visualisation and the chantcontinue and the sphere becomes stabilised, the feelings in the sex organsbecome more intense. Often this can result in spontaneous orgasm. In the Rite, which is subdivided into two distinct sub routines, the firing upof the womb sphere causes various hormones to be deposited there in increasedamounts, depending upon the stage within the menstrual cycle at which theexercise is performed. During the applicable point in menstrual discharge theblood will contain ATP (adenosine triphosphate) and thyroxine3, which are collected for use as rejuvenants. In the second sub-routine, whichis conducted mid-cycle, the content of the Graffenberg gland is harvested. Thisis thought to contain melatonin, vassopresin, dopamine, prolactin, retinol andoxytocin. The last two neurotransmitters will also be found in the menstrualblood. These are also present as a reaction to the Rite of the Vampire itselfwhich, as one of the highest rites of Courtly Love, should be undertaken as anact of hierogamy or the union of the souls of the divine lovers. If this occursthen the brain of both the maiden and the Vampire will manufacture prolactin andoxytocin which will result in that feeling of intense bonding between the two sooften recorded in Vampire lore. If it does not, the ritual is not beingundertaken in the right spirit. The two sub-routines within the Rite of the Vampire are entitled: The Rite ofthe Grail — The Rose of Sharon — Blood The Rite of the Cubic Stone — The Lilyof the Valley — Water (Sharon is Hebrew for Princess) At the point where orgasm has subsided, if it does occur, remember to think thecommand or gesture. Rest and regain breathing and relaxation and return yourattention to Kether. 8) At Kether, fire the sphere up again and resume the chant. Imagine in yourmind's eye the layout of the brain and brain stem. From Kether, visualise thechannel of light extending from the back of the brain, down through the spinalcolumn to its base around the pelvis. From the pelvis direct the light to thebladder and urethra. When the channel is established to the urethra imagine thatjust behind the clitoris, under the pubic bone, following the duct of theurethra from the opening between the labia minora, there is a swelling. To helpyou locate this before commencing the exercise, it is best to feel just insidethe vagina and up against the pubic bone. Located at that point of the urethrais the Graffenberg gland and at this point you should visualise it swelling andbeing engulfed in a light of lunar silver. When this visualisation is established feel the vibration of the chant LO LOOUAH. This Sephira is a subdivision of Yesod. In western Kabala, Yesod coversthe entire sexual region which, for the Rite of the Vampire, is too imprecise.By subdividing Yesod into two, Yesod and Milathara, concentration can bedirected more effectively. Milathara is an Aryan variation found in Tantra. LOLO OUAH is the second part of the Yesod chant directed to the G region insteadof being used for Yesod as a whole. At the point where the sphere of Milatharais established and experienced rather than willed, the G-gland will begin tobecome sensate and tingling. After a while it may also cause orgasm anddischarge a clear fluid. The sensations accompanying this are utterly differentfrom any other type of orgasm. In effect it is the female form of ejaculation.The possibility of this occurring whilst practising the exercises in preparationfor the Rite depend of the visualisation capabilities of the subject. During theRite the ejaculation is assisted manually anyway. If it does occur, allow thesensation to subside and think the command or gesture. Now reassess the state ofthe Sephira and channels, and enhance their respective intensities accordingly.Once they are all working at optimum level again, initiate the followingprocess:La Fontaine de VieThe Red Egg9) At this point the sensation of being egg-shaped will still be felt. TheFountain exercise is accomplished to ensure an evening out of the energiesthroughout the morphic field, which is then charged to sustain a field ofnegative ionisation. This field will then alter the polarity of the hormonalelectrostatic charge which increases the hormonal impact and its affects onsynaptic uptake following ingestion. Starting at the Kether sphere, visualise afountain of brilliant, sparkling blue-gold water flowing from the top of thesphere down either side of the body to the outer perimeter of the morphic fieldand down to the lowest point of the field just beyond the feet. When it hasreached the base of the egg, visualise its flow returning up the body, this timeunder the back and over the breast until the flow reaches and re-enters Kether.Repeat this exercise until a continuous outward and return flow has beenestablished. The hormones are now charged. After about five minutes, turn the water intowarm, glowing blood. Red is the colour of energy discharging. As the objectduring the actual Rite itself is to expel the energy and donate the essence, thecolour red tends to push matter away from the source of its nascence. This, inconjunction with the blood as a mystical symbol in itself, is the origin of theIcon of the Scarlet Woman and the Whore of Babylon, the Virgin Mother of Christand the Maiden Magdalene. In the Nine stages of the Nahash, the serpent of wisdom, the exercise iscomplete. In the Sacred Grove, the Maiden is now the Tree of Life* and the Treeof Knowledge and the serpent is entwined in her branches. The Sephira are theApples of Avalon glowing under the leaves of her flesh. Her slender boughs arethe myriad of vessels, arteries and nerve fibres through which flows the sweetsap of Holy Blood and the Waters of Life. In her topmost branches rests thewhite Dove of Peace, whilst at her feet the waters of the pool of eternal wisdomripple with the eddying breath of her sacred scents.Into the clearing, wandering in the Quest of life-giving waters, appears theStag of Nine Tines, The Great Lord of the Forest. The Green StagFor the Vampire princess or prince the exercise is exactly the same in allpoints except that in the case of the male, he omits the Malathara sphere andthe channel from the brain stem. In Magic, the use of colour and vibrationcorresponds with known scientific fact concerning the qualities relating to thefrequencies of light energy levels. For each colour there is its opposite and inthe case of red, its optical correspondent is green. This can be ascertained bystaring at a red coloured spot for about a minute. If one then looks at a whitesheet of paper, the persistence of vision will make it seem as if a green spothas appeared on the sheet. The colour green is the true colour of the Vampirefor this very reason. Whilst red is a positive, emitting colour, green is anegative absorbing colour which draws life into it. In consequence the Dragonprincess or prince who is to act as supplicant to the Maiden should infuse their“morphic field” with green. *Lilith's Stag Lord was Samael, the Dragon King. The Pictish variant of this isthe Boar in the Orchard. The Blue Boar in the orchard consumes the apples ofAvalon. We have numerous examples of the Ancient Rites of the Elves and these were inmany cases the Rites of the Vampire, both being of one and the same identity.The colour most associated with the Elves of the ancient forests was green.Similarly, the colour of the Stag of Nine Tines that drank from the Holy Grailwas green, and that stag was the emblem of the Pictish Calle Daouine king andqueen, the Oberon and Titania of Shakespeare. In medieval art, both the Stag andthe Dragon were often depicted as being led on a golden chain by the Maiden.Thereby we are given to understand that the relationship between the Vampire andthe virgin is one of female choice and male devotion. It was only later with the advent of Catharism and the rise of the Dragon Courtand its most famous prince, Dracula, that the colour black became associatedwith the archetypal Vampire. This arose because of the colour of the Cathar robeand the Dragon Court tradition of wearing Black on Fridays to honour the CubicStone and Venus. Notwithstanding, the standard colours for the Dragon Court at other times wereHunter's green and blood red. Otherwise green was always associated with theFairies and the Fairies were always associated with vampirism by the humanpopulation, who were encouraged to live in terror of their Otherworldly cousins,and exhorted never to wear the Elven Green, which was evil and unlucky. The Time of the SeasonSpecific times during the cycle of ovulation were chosen to drink the Blood ofLife and the Waters of Wisdom. As the constitution of every Dragon princess wasdifferent, the nights of the Rite varied for each one. Essentially two nightsper lunar month were set aside for the alternate drinking of blood or water. Theideal time could be ascertained by counting a certain number of days from thedischarge of the ova to mid-cycle. The calculation could not be written in stoneas the human circadian cycle works to a rhythm that has a “day” of twenty-fivehours. A time discrepancy occurs which adjusts itself regularly, but this causesfluctuations in the secretion of hormones. The body's day, beginning at 0001hrs, finishes not at 2359 hrs. as the chronological day does, but at 0100 hrs.,25 hours later. As a result of this and other factors, female menstruationoccurs within a plus or minus window which had to be anticipated. The Temple of the Goddess(See also Wild Hunt) The Rite of the Vampire was often conducted in a Forest orSacred Garden. In Anjou, Melusine is said to have conducted the Rite in a mazegarden in the midst of which stood her sacred fountain. The garden was situatedin the forest of Verrieres-en-Forez which was an underwood populated byblackthorns and briars. The maze, conforming to classical Scythian design, wouldhave been shaped like a spiral Swastika. In the centre stood a black marblecube. From beneath the plinth there flowed the gentle rippling stream, symbolicof the flow of the fountain from Melusine's own sacred being. The “Cubic Stone”and the “Fountain” symbolised the Graffenberg gland, the “Jewel in the Crown” ofLucifer, whilst the maze represented the “Spiral Dance of the Vortex”. Thedirection one entered signified whether one was to give or to receive (seenotes: Swastika). On another level the maze represented the “Quest for the HolyGrail”, the end of being and thus the “Still Centre of the Universe”, in whichis to be found the truth of all truth. The spiral dance was a significant ritualfeature of Witchcraft, whose practitioners provided the backbone of support forthe ancient Elven families. The Forez or thicket of blackthorn symbolised the forest of the mons veneris. Asimilar forest of thorns is to be found in the story of Sleeping Beauty. Theblackthorn tree, the “Tree of Elphame”, was thought to be ruled by Saturn, whowas the angelic spirit of the Sephiroth of Binah, whose sacred flower was thelily of the valley. Binah represented “Understanding”. UnderStanding is the actof giving way or yielding. It is passive perception. The act of yielding orbending to a greater intelligence was represented by the willow or wicker, fromwhence originated the word Wicca or Witch. Binah was called the “Primordial Deep” which, also represented by Tiamat thegreat Dragon queen, was replicated in a multitude of sacred lakes and wells inScythian myth which were said to be the gateways to the Otherworld. To drinkfrom the waters of the sacred lakes, fountains or wells was to enter theOtherworld, Elphame, the source of Death and Rebirth. The symbolism of theMelusine's sacred garden is an extension of the Otherworldly sacredness of herown nature. It is an intimation of the magical qualities of her feminine sex anda hint of the promise of transcendence for all those who imbibe of her essencesand the essences of those of her Fairy maiden kin and posterity. Binah's sacred animal was the bee. This creature was used by the Merovingians asa totem dynastic badge which, in relation to the other glyphs associated withthis sephiroth, recount the entire arcane wisdom of the Holy Grail and the Riteof the Vampire. Associated closely with Binah was the cypress. Used as anincense at both weddings and funerals, this tree symbolised Constancy orTranscendance (Death) through Divine Union (Marriage). The message isstraightforward. The Bee (Vampire) sucks the Nectar of the Lily (Grail Maiden),which act is an act of Union, resulting in Death, the Transcendence ofConsciousness. The Temple of the Goddess is the Maiden's vulva. Symbolically this is reproducedon a greater scale and becomes variously and euphemistically the Isle of Avalon,the Sacred Grove, the Garden of Love, the Rose Garden, the Hind in the Thicket,the Maze in the Forest and: La Fontaine de Soif dans le Jardin Sauvage. The endand beginning of all delights and all sorrows, this scented enclosure providesthe stage within which is enacted the greatest of all mysteries: the Rite of theVampire.

Beneath Moonlight and Starshine, her hands tracing delicate arabesques, shesings softly in a tongue long forgotten, a haunting, breathless melody thatembraces the night, harmonising with the sparkling plainsong of the softcascading water, spilling from beneath the dark, unyielding plinth upon whichshe reclines. The Shining One, his sister his bride; this Lord of yesterday holds close withinhis heart as she gazes deep into the stark abyss above the western sky. Withchildlike eyes as old as the Ancient of Days, she surveys with her infinite soulher sister, that eternal timeless realm, heedless of her lover's impatient footfalls upon the Chamomile swathe, amidst which her sacred monument stands rootedupon the earth. Yielding the translucent flesh of her slender, glowing limbs to the hungryembrace of this ice black, unforgiving tomb; in her preoccupation, her stillnessnow feigns death's charade, causing the yearning approach of her lover tobridle, as he stands and meditates with wonder this moonbathed mystery, whereinsoft pale skin and shimmering cubic stone entwined, become sculpted as one, inthe eloquence of their radiant glory. Countenancing such, what heart has he now that isn't bound about by GoldenChains and enslaved by the look of her? What has she left within him in thatfleeting moment but a lonely chasm as cold as the bed upon which she lays and ashollow as the abyss upon which her Innocent Contemplation rests. His emptinessis filled with tears that can never quench his thirst for her. In some middle distant glade, within the dark encroaching forest, a Turtle Dovebreaks in upon his sweet agony with a spectral strain for some far off burnishedlove, echoing the pleas of his sundered eldritch soul. No murmured answer isrejoined, but the softly responding cadence of this lord's beloved bride,enshrined beneath the boundless canopy of heaven. The dying refrain of her tender imprecation quickens his desire, as theincantation in its ceasing, summons him to his abeisance, to his heart's briefease—and oblivion. To the Turtle the Phoenix replied: “For my love, thy constancy; For thy wine, my eternal soul”. Then raised she opens to him with Myrrh moistened fingers, and with one, heavyscented, dew dripp'd kiss, he drinks deep from the fountain of thirst andempties her cup of sorrows. With Myrrh moistened fingers she opens to him thedoor of a realm he now sees with her eyes. And trading longing for longing, inher tender arms he yields to her his promised soul, and dies. If we define love as a prolonged and mutual attachment both sexual and spiritualbetween two people, we find that it is sometimes considered as primarily aEuropean phenomenon. Romantic love in Europe appears to have been unknown priorto the appearance in late eleventh-century France of the troubadours andtrouvères. That is not to say that attachments of this kind did not existbetween individuals before that time, but that it was not accepted andformalised as a popular conception. For example, the emphasis in the Norse Sagasis almost entirely on heroic deeds and adventure. Heroines are formidable womenwho would not be guilty of lukewarm, feminine passions—they are admired for malequalities. This is in marked contrast to the essential erotic element ofProvencal poetry of the following centuries. The overwhelming emphasis on sexuality and sexual passion which ischaracteristic of the pagan literatures of Europe, particularly the Irish, isnot evidence for the existence of romantic notions of love. For example, thepicture that emerges from Celtic literature is of a society devoted to sexualpursuits but paying very little regard to the relationships between individuals.The incident in the Feast of Bricriu when the hero Cuchulain and his followers,who are being entertained by the King of Ulster, are offered fifty women eachfor their sexual needs—the number includes the Queen and her daughter—can beregarded as typical of Celtic ideas of love. The essential refinement with which the troubadours cloaked adulterous love isindicative of the times. One of the most remarkable features of the rise ofromantic love was that the same period was characterised by extremely barbaric,brutal and disgusting practices by both men and women. Sexuality might very wellbe the theme of magnificent poetry, but at the same time, to judge fromcontemporary poems and romances, the first thought of every knight on finding aLady alone and unprotected was to commit violence against her. There are numerous instances of this kind of behaviour both in prose and poetry.The Lait de Graelent, by Marie de France, tells how a gentle and perfect knightmeets a damsel alone in the forest. He brutally assaults and rapes her. Howeverhe is forgiven, for underneath he is fundamentally courteous and honourable. Thecontradiction is quite extraordinary. It is seen again in the instructions givento the good knight Sir Perceval by his mother “...If thou, see a fair woman, paythy court to her, whether she will or no; for thus wilt thou render thyself abetter and more esteemed man than thou wast before.” The argument is well put byChretien de Troyes. A knight finding a damsel alone must offer her no harm butif another knight accompanies her, and he defeats him in combat the lady is histo do with as he wishes. The distinction is subtle but real. The adulation offighting was on a level with love. No reasonable woman would refuse a conqueringknight. To take her by force, as in Marie de France's poem, was really not quitethe thing to do. Different interpretations can be made of this early literature of romantic love.One view, which we are inclined to support, is that the essential lawlessnessand brutality of the period was overlaid by a film of idealisation of thefeminine which was at times acted out in reality, at other times grosslydisregarded. Another is that the knights and troubadours (my note: of Provenceand Flanders) constituted a kind of island of culture and gentility in a sea of(Norman and Catholic) barbarism—that in fact the two worlds were not connected.We find this difficult to accept in the face of the evidence. Vernon Lee suggests in Euphorion a picture of a Provencal court. The courtconsists of all those with any pretensions to nobility from the greatest lord tothe lowest page. These, as opposed to the brutal peasantry without, were unitedin their service to the wife of the great lord and her ladies. The atmosphere is redolent of dedication and service; the realities of medievallife elsewhere—the burning and sacking of castles, the rape of women, thetorture of peasants—are far removed. To pretend that there were not strongelements of graciousness, even spirituality, in some Provencal courts would beuntrue, but at the same time to discount the barbaric elements both within thecourt and outside in the teeming world would be unrealistic. It is true that Provence at the time enjoyed comparative peace compared with therest of Europe. It is very probable that cessation from perpetual warfare andforays enabled the noble poets to develop and embellish this extraordinarymanifestation of the human spirit. This would explain the transposing of anordinary knight's service into service to a lady. Instead of preoccupation withwar, the lord could now afford amatory adventures. It does not however explainthe startling invention of the courts of love with their exacting interpretationof minute points of courtly behaviour in what seems direct imitation ofscholastic theological disputes. Lovers were bound by the rules of “courtesia”,patience and moderation—that is, restraint. The real problem is to discover therealities of the situation. In the literature there is a metaphysical andallegorical aspect together with an appreciation of the grossest sensuality. Theprecepts of behaviour we have quoted have to be set against the exacting fealtyto one's lady demanded by the courts of love and exemplified in Chretien deTroye's Lancelot. (lines 5641 et seq.) The obscenity of the earliest troubadours, Count William of Poitou, for example,is hard to believe. The vast majority of successors, such as Arnaud Daniel andBertram de Born, are equally at pains to show that it is physical and notspiritual possession they desire. There is a very real contradiction here for inthe Lancelot of de Troyes there are numerous references to abstractions such aslove and reason on an altogether different plane from sensuality. There are manyother examples. The blending of sensual love, service to womankind, allegory andambition is a strange one. But whatever interpretation is used, the fact remainsthat the concept of Courtly Love invented by the troubadours in Provence was thestarting point for all the subsequent European manifestations of romantic love. My view, however, is that Courtly Love may not have been invented by thetroubadours. The aggressive sexuality of William of Poitou and many of hiscontemporaries merely illustrates the point that the Church's noble and royalpuppets had no notion of the courtly behaviour and exoteric elements. One mightsuggest that a progression towards decline and secularism in regard to thepopular notion of Courtly Love was confirmed by people such as von Ragenau. The exoteric view today seems to regard his following minnesang as trulydefining the notion of Courtly Love. I wish to be known my entire life as a master of one thing and one thing only; Iseek the world's praise for this one skill: That no man can bear his sufferingas beautifully as I. If a woman causes me pain to such an extent that I cannotremain silent night or day, I have such a gentle spirit that I'll accept herhate as a source of joy; And yet, alas, how deeply that discomforts me! One might be inclined to the view that by the 14th century, when von Hagenau waswriting, the Church had already begun to have a considerable influence on theconcept. Some clerics, particularly the Anglo-Norman monk Fra. Orderic Vitalis,had previously roundly condemned Courtly Love for shifting the lord's orknight's attention from Mother Church and her holy wars. However it had quiteprobably begun to appreciate how the concept might be sanitised, twisted andmanipulated to facilitate religious social control by exacerbating internaldivision and confusion within the individual. As a consequence of and despite the influence of people such as von Eschenbach,the words of von Hagenau seem to have sealed the fate of Courtly Love fordecades until the restoration of the fundamental raison d'etre of the concept.This came about in the esoteric publications of the metaphysical poets, inparticular the works of Marlowe, Donne and Shakespeare. Shakespeare’s poem fromThe Passionate Pilgrim, The Phoenix and the Turtle has, as its theme, theconcept of “love and constancy”. In itself as a euphemism, it would seem tounderpin the spiritual rules of “courtesia”. I quote, “...Leaving no posterity:twas not their infirmity. It was married chastity...” The concept of an absolute monogomy or hierogamy, transcending sexuality, may beclearly perceived in this particular poem. The kabalistic reference in theopening stanza is unmistakable and for these reasons, personal use was made ofthe Phoenix and turtle motifs in the Prose Summary of the Starfire modusoperandi, Rite of the Vampire. One must make the observation that von Hagenau,despite being given ample opportunity not to do so, appears to have merelyreiterated the popular view of Courtly Love as a source of lament prompted byunrequited love. Nothing could be further from the truth. Courtly Love isnecessarily requited but often lost, and this, in a sense, is the source of thepain and longing: Le Soif, as The Sundering suggests. The SunderingFor every bloodied rendwithin that heart,there was a silent talefor which those lips had neither wit,nor art. And every tear heshed, sullen eyed;traced a shattered, ancient dream,which in that dark despair and hopelesssilence died. How could this be,does grief end?His soul desired much moreof her than man could know,or manners condescend. She loved him oncebut that withdrawn,Never could he love againas life's hope from very life itselfwas torn. But is this the longing for the beloved, as it would appear to be in Keats' LaBelle Dame Sans Merci, or for the condition she engenders and the vision of some“far away country” that can dissipate at her departure, or for both? It wasfully intended that the sad anticipation of such a loss be intimated in theProse Summary, along with the longings that accompany such encounters andrelationships. This is because the literary evidence suggests that these unions,intended to be spiritual, inevitably come to an end, sometimes, but not always,disastrously and permanently. In the latter event, although the mythical cyclesvary according to the personalities involved, it is because of the breaking ofsome taboo, or the misconstruing of the nature of the relationship and thespiritual dynamic, usually by the male. In support of such a view we can quote the story of Arthur and Guinevere as wellas that of Raymond and Melusine. Baring-Gould says, “...The framework of themyth is the story-radical corresponding with that of Lohengrin.” The skeleton ofthe romance is this: 1. A human male falls in love with a Fairy female. 2. She consents to live with him on one condition. 3. He breaks the condition and loses her. 4. He either regains her or not.... In the Prose Summary, although being intentionally romantic by degrees, the mainthrust of the piece is intended to convey the magical, initiatory purpose of theencounter. This is apparent in various concealed works on the subject, includingthe foregoing Phoenix and the Turtle and the Song of Songs, whose romanticelement conveys in allegory, the ecstasy of hierogamical union through love. Such unions appear to be temporary in nature and abide until the initiationintended by the mystical union is completed, or becomes completed through thepain experienced at the sundering, which is the method by which the Sumaire isawoken and the fontaine de soif is made apparent. The poem concerning the Crossof Lorraine and the Clear Fountain (from Baigent, Leigh and Lincoln: Holy Blood,Holy Grail) is significant in this regard. The physical manifestation of theobject of longing, the Grail Maiden, seems naturally to re-enact the role ofIshtar within a cycle which happens spontaneously, as part of a recurringarchetypal myth superimposed on real life. The response of the intimate shouldthus be that of the Tantric Brahmin to his lover Kali, whose blood sets himfree, but necessarily “at the price of his mortal soul”. The imagery of love and loss, the Fairy Maiden, the garden and the fountain seeminextricably linked with the final stages of this process of introduction to asupernatural world of perception hidden from mortal eyes. This world, however,is one of blended pleasures and mixed blessings. Its beauty and pathos is farmore evocatively, and therefore necessarily, conveyed within a prose style whichattempts to describe, with the added components of imagery and emotion, theexperiences of the subjects in their real life situations as they happened thenand as they still happen now. In this respect, by comparing the prose of von Hagenau with the dedication toCandida by Jack Parsons, former Grand Master of O.T.O., we would seem able torecapture the essential vision of the Dragon Maiden and the Garden of “Love”.This is not intellectually in the words, but in the visions engendered by thespirit that prompted the pen. In this poem, Narcissus, one might gain a glimpseof the deeper alchemy beneath the “courtesia”. The work was first published as part of an alchemical compilation called Songsfor the Witch Woman and later appeared in O.T.O's publication “Starfire”.Candida enacted the role of Grail Maiden or Scarlet Woman. Again the cycle endedabruptly and in this case Parsons lost everything, including at the end of theprocess, his life, fulfilling, one might suggest, the requirement for theinitiate to offer up to Kali or Ishtar his life blood on the burning ground orpyre of the Saints. Spiritual allegories sometimes become physical realities,especially if the magician has realised that the divisions between what isconsidered “spiritual” and what is conversely labelled “physical” are merelyarbitrary and linguistic. Narcissus Drug me with drugs; slow acting, sensuous, sweetCo-mingle Gin and Musk, Hashish and Amber,Let me drink and breatheand hear slow devious, music. Until aroused to sub langorous moods,Until I see Ochre and Mazarineand Purple Emit lascivious sounds. Then I shall go through dark and Gothic ruins,Grey and Golden mist; down to a Forest Green, With an Old Dream. I shall go naked; and Magnolia and Oleander,Datura and Jasmine,Whose blossoms will open and vaginally flower,In infinite time, for a relative hour,Whose White subliminal flowers will caress my breasts.And I shall perform stately,Phallic Arabesques,In the Moonlight Pale and White. Endocrinal dynamics ATP (adenosyne triphosphate) is the fuel of life which in youth sustains anactive, healthy body and mind. As the body ages the levels of melatonin drop andthe body cells begin to slowly degenerate and become tired. In particular, thecells of the thymus which stores T-cells begin to atrophy and are replaced byfatty tissue. When this starts to happen the body's immune system slows down andfinds it more difficult to shake off illnesses that in youth would not havewarranted any attention at all. As the cells begin to atrophy and themitochondria become frayed, it is less able to produce ATP and this itselfweakens the cells further. It is thought that telomerase in menstrual blood isone of the major contributors to mitochondrial regeneration. As the cells become weak and less able to maintain structural integrity, theability of the mitachondria to convert thyroxine 3 efficiently is compromised.It begins instead to produce partial reactions resulting in the ATP beingconverted more and more into pyrophosphates and literally fossilises the body'scells. As the pineal gland begins to succumb to this process, it lays downcalcium salts in the pineal body which results in the production of lessmelatonin. With the production of less melatonin all the bodily functions suffer. Howeverin this particular regard it means that there is less melatonin to react withthe pituitary and thyroid glands which themselves have suffered a reduction inthe amount of hormones they are capable of producing due to the affects ofcellular atrophy. Less thyroxine 4 can be processed into thyroxine3 because of the declining level of pineal output and the degeneratingmitochondria produce less ATP, so the cycle of decline continues. The ageingprocess has begun. Summary The Grail comprises not only the Grail Maiden but a set of psychosomaticexercises which stimulate enhanced endocrinal function within her physiology.Furthermore, these exercises also polarise the general energy field around thebody which in turn polarises the ions of the hormones required. In laboratoryexperiments on seratonin conducted in the USA, it has been demonstrated that thefield should be positive, which correlates with what the Tantrics, Alchemistsand Grail Knights already knew anyway. The recipient of the Grail Maiden'sgenerosity similarly has to perfect the art of accomplishing this exerciseefficiently. She or he engages in the rite in exactly the same manner as theMaiden until the fountain point. At this juncture the recipient's energy fieldshould be charged negatively by using the reverse components to those beinginstalled by the Maiden. At the point where the Grail Maiden has successfully fired up her system and therecipient similarly has sensitised their constitution, the process of extractiontakes place. In the case of the Rose of Diana this is achieved orally. However,in the case of the Lily of the Valley the beneficiary, like the Fisher King,sups from the Grail with a Golden Straw. Simply put, the Tantrics et al wouldinsert a golden flute into the urethra and massage the internal area of thevagina just under the pubic bone. After a few minutes a swelling is detected.This is the engorging of the Graffenberg Gland which has, corresponding to it, aspecial little Chakra. At the point of g-spot orgasm the fluid contained in the gland is dischargedinto the urethra and is sucked through the golden straw. As with the Rose ofDiana, the Lily of the Valley is held sublingually for some time beforeswallowing. The reason for this is that the process of digestion reduces theintake of the required hormones, whereas sublingual ingestion is achieveddirectly through the blood vessels under the tongue. This act is the physical aspect of Courtly Love. If intercourse were to takeplace, the psyche of the Grail Maiden would change. The same psychosomaticdynamics which allow her to affect the functioning of her endocrinal systemwould also radically affect subconsciously the levels of hormones she wascapable of producing. In tandem with the reduction of melatonin in thebloodstream caused by an increase in body mass after puberty, sexual intercourseactually triggers the genes to start the ageing process and the reduction ofhormonal output. The female body recognises vaginal penetration as a key to thematuring process. This is Royal Vampirism on the physical level. Rather than being predatory,Royal Vampirism is actually founded upon intimacy and love. It offers spiritualdepth and value in its celebration of the most private of female processes, oneswith which other cultures insult and shame the female by claiming it to beunclean or taboo. The legend of the homosexuality of the Templars is probably founded upon truth.On Lindon Hill in Lincoln there used to be a Templar Preceptory devoted to theMagdalene. In practice, so the local story goes, it was a Templar brothel. It ismore than likely that the institution was a Solomonic Harem (harem means “HolyPlace”) devoted to the support of Virgin Maidens of the Grail. The Templarsthemselves probably did not indulge in penetrative intercourse with these girlsbut provided for their upkeep as Templar nuns whose task it was to perform theRite of RTU, the first flow of the womb. To avoid intercourse with them theTemplars relieved each other. In the tradition of Courtly Love the interaction was described as non sexual andPlatonic. The chosen maiden was not just considered to be the incarnation of theGoddess, she was the Goddess, and in the rites described, the devotion to herwould have been considered to be worship. Here is an example of a form of unionwith the goddess Diana, where her essence is partaken of, but her flesh remainsuncompromised. She gives birth to inspiration in her devotee and is the motherof their creative and transcendent perceptions, but like Mary the Ichthys, Dianaremains the Virgin Queen of Heaven. The original “Hierarchical Rule” of the Templars, founded by King Baldwin deVere in 1100, admitted women and children. "},{"pageContent":"[images/00056.jpg] Chapter 20 The Grail Maiden of History The ideal Grail Maiden in classical times, generally speaking, was described bymedieval and Renaissance writers as being between approximately 12 and 18 yearsold and of Royal Scythian Blood. Her hair would have been flaming red, her skinwhite, with an underlying hint of pale gold, like peach and cream. Her figurewould have been slight, with understated gender development and her facialfeatures would have been refined, framing large, penetrating eyes of blue orvivid green behind which would be suggested the vast abyss of eternity andinfinite space. The aura about her would have been physically felt as a charge, underlying whichwould have been detected an unselfconscious stillness, compassion and detachmentfrom worldly cares. Above all she would have been a virgin for the duration ofher attachment to the Queen or King as their Shunnamite or Twylleg. Virginity Females have larger pineal glands than males and even though they mature earlierthan boys, girls with their larger pineal glands and smaller blood volume,usually tend to produce more melatonin and other hormones than boys. Thiscontinues throughout life and means that females certainly live longer and aremore resilient than males. As they grow up, both boys’ and girls’ pineal glands produce a constantunaltering amount of melatonin. From about the age of two years the pinealbegins to function at its optimum level, and this doesn't increase as the childgrows larger. When young, therefore, the child's bloodstream is rich withmelatonin, but as the child grows in size the blood volume increases and themelatonin to blood ratio drops. When the serum level reaches its lowest point,this triggers the production of oestrogen in girls and testosterone in boys,which further inhibits the production of melatonin. The reason there were no such things as Grail Youths is simply because the malesdo not produce as much melatonin as females, and the physical farming of thehormone would be problematical to say the least. However, even during pubertythe female would produce a substantially larger amount of melatonin than themale, and because of the female constitution it would have been accessible bynatural and non-aggressive means. Although affecting the blood serum level of melatonin, the onset of puberty isthe time when the physiological functions of the female permit the procurementof the hormones required. Between 12 and 17 there is a tight window ofopportunity where the body hasn't fully grown and melatonin levels are not yetat their lowest point. Additionally, as the chosen maiden was virgin, she had no experience of actualpenetration and she couldn't fully anticipate what the experience felt like.Consequently the release of melatonin inhibiting hormones like oestrogen andadrenaline was likely to be less in an inexperienced virgin anticipating sexualpenetration than it would be in a girl who fantasised about an experience shealready knew and desired. The desire level linked with the ability to visualise the act from experiencewas likely to stimulate the release of more oestrogen and adrenaline in the nonvirgin than it was in the virgin. In much the same fashion, a person in theanticipation of the consumption of their favourite dish is likely to releasemore saliva in their mouth than in the mouth of a person to whom that dish ismerely described. Adrenaline in particular is a killer, which is why vampirism,which is supposed to be the harvesting of life-enhancing substances could nothistorically a) involve any sexual context and b) have been non-consensualBoth sex and fear cause the adrenal gland to work overtime, releasing adrenalineinto the bloodstream. In the case of the Gothic approach, this would then enterthe system of the Dragon and affect exactly the opposite result to that whichwas intended, namely longevity and transcendence. In any case, this had a subtlenon-corporeal element which could have only been experienced with a female whoentered “of her own free will” and who was prepared “to leave behind a little ofthe life and joy that she brought with her”, (Bram Stoker, Dracula). Awillingness on the part of the female to act as a sustainer within a consensualinteraction released all the right hormones and corresponding energies. Facedwith force, the barriers would naturally have descended and the Grail would havebecome a Cup of Sorrows. The effort in training an older female to perform the same rites efficientlywould not have been compensated by the return obtained from her constitution, incomparison to a younger virgin female. In such a situation it would have beenlike preparing a table for a silver service banquet of five courses and endingup sitting there with a beef and tomato flavoured Pot Noodle. There would havebeen a discrepancy between effort invested and nutrition obtained, which in allspecies is against the natural law of the conservation of energy. This is whythe Vampire's “victim” is always depicted in Gothic Romance as being a youngfemale virgin. "},{"pageContent":"[images/00042.jpg]Chapter 21 Witches, Dragons and Boggarts In reading the following it should be remembered that the Druids, and theScythians in general, loved putting double entendre and multiple layers ofmeaning within words and phrases, a linguistic practice which, in Hebrew, ismediated and facilitated by Numerology. Flesh on BonesIn 14th-century Ireland, Dame Alice Kyteler was arraigned for Witchcraft.Amongst a number of charges she was accused of worshipping the Devil, a Witches’god named Robin Artisson. As an exercise in revision and expansion we will takeanother look at this name and develop further on the synthesis conducted in thelast series of notes. The name Robin Artisson can translate as Robin, meaning“bright” or “shining fame” or “red-bright” and Artis-son, perhaps as theArtisan's son, giving either “The red-haired Shining One” or “The Fairy King,son of the Architect” (artisan-tekton-masonsmith). An earlier rendering mighthave been Artisson as Mac Art. Let’s deal firstly with Robin. This name, as bright or shining one, correspondswith Ahura Mazda, Lord of Light and Ormurd, which I mantain relateslinguistically to the Serpent of Light from Orm, the root of Worm, a Dragon orserpent; and Mazdh, the Light. This being the case, the “Architect” on one level would, in relation, be theAncient of Days, who was Zirvan. In Monarchic Dualism, the three principles areZirvan, Ahura Mazda, Ahrunan or: Space/Time-Increase-Decrease, whilst Ahriman isthe Serpent of the Darkness. This philosophy approximates with the originalEurasian, proto-Zoroastrian tradition from which both Hinduism and Druidhismcome. We also know that pre-Nicaean Christianity had been closely associated with thisroot and included the triad comprising God-Satan-Jesus. In the following, theWitches’ god, Robin Artisson or Robin Hood can be appreciated as being closelyrelated to these triads. Jesus himself was thought to correspond with Mithrasand Ahura Mazda and was also the son of an artisan. Directly descended from hisline we also have Bera the Architect (Vera Mason!). Robin Artisson is a variant of the British and Gallic Robin Hoods, and appearsas the Witches’ god in Ireland, as previously stated, who is interchangeablewith the Gallic Basque god of the Witches, Janicot, who is also known in Britainas Little John. As we know Janicot is Jani-Gon or JanusGod, the two-headed ordualistic deity, which indicates clearly that the Witches were dualists, as weretheir cultic cousins, the pre-Nicaean Christians. In England we have one of at least two triads. One consists of: HerneRobinHood-Little John, where perhaps, as I have suggested, Robin and John, infollowing ancient tradition, were either brothers or partners in an ancientDragon family ritual—or one person—as were Jesus and Satan, variously andcosmically speaking, in some gnostic traditions. In traditional English folklore, the father of Robin Goodfellow was Herne theHunter. As Robin Goodfellow is identical to Puck, whose father was Oberon, thenit follows that Herne the Hunter and Oberon are also the same person. In thetales concerning Robin Goodfellow, he was a flesh and blood character who livedwith human parents. One night he felt the call of the wild and left home towander the Greenwood, meet his real father, Oberon, and engage in variousadventures with his own kind. One gets the impression that in some way, perhapsthrough unuttered longings, he was “called to the Dragon” or called to followhis true genetic nature which, prior to his departure, had been intimated to himin restless notions and strange dreams, but had been otherwise unknown. He islike the changeling or the Fairy orphan adopted by humans. In some senses thestory of Jesus is the same, the humble son of the carpenter who is really theSon of God, a standard fairy tale motif which is repeated to this day. Concerning the BoggartC. S. Lewis called dwarves “The sons of Stone” whilst in Scandinavia these werethe Trolls. Boggart may have had two spellings. The first and perhaps the olderof the two was Boggard or Bog Ard, meaning the High God, who was the Dagdha. Asthe god-king of the Danaan, the Dagdha would have been the royal arch-Druid ofthe Tuadhe or nation. With regard to the other spelling, a reduction into twoparts gives Bogg and Art. The first means God and the second means Stone and hence, Godstone or God'sStone. In Phallic Worship by George Riley-Scott, one particular standing stonein Israel, said to be the God Stone and thought of as the habitation of the Godwas named Beth-El or the Bethel Stone, which is a Boggart. Alternatively theBoggart could mean God of the Stone, which easily renders itself as the God-Kingof the Lia Fail or the Cubic Stone, the Grail. Boggart, as the God's Stone;would be the Lia Fail. As the Stone that fell to Earth, the jewel in Lucifer's Crown and so forth, thetrail leads back to Robin Artisson. In which case, the anointed stone of theBeth-El and the Lia Fail, the cubic stone, would be female and not male. Thefemale in question would be related to Astaroth, the forerunner of Sophia,wisdom or the Holy Spirit, to which the anointing oil of the Hebrews relates asthe dew of the cup or Rosicrucis. Astaroth is Ishtar, who was a draconianrelation of Lilith the Dragon queen, the ancestral grandmother of the Tuadha deDanaan. A few Victorian amateur anthropologists, wishing to bring a breath of fresh airinto the stuffy drawing rooms of the middle classes, made much of the fertilityrituals and beliefs of ancient and primitive peoples. Given the social climateof the time, this intention was thoroughly laudable but, in their haste toattribute venal meanings to transcendent rituals and artefacts, they seem tohave set in motion a movement devoted to missing the point. One can imagine the relish with which some must have anticipated the opportunityafforded them. Here, it seemed, was a license to shock without let or hindrance,presenting itself under the guise of valuable scientific research. Thisnotwithstanding, and despite the entertainment value, it must be said that anyattempt to confront Victorian sensibilities proved in itself to have been ratherpointless. In many instances the work was either edited or suppressed by a society that wasnot only the most hypocritical and morally corrupt but also, behind closeddoors, the most lascivious and sexually inventive in western history. The work of these pioneers was ground breaking and in particular we remember SirRichard Burton with respect. Even so, the foundations they laid seem to havebeen built upon later by others whose only thrust appears to have been inproving that everything they discovered that might be labelled primitive, was inconsequence automatically associated with fertility. Such a mentality was both an insult to simpler or earlier cultures and a serioushindrance to their understanding. It came to be thought that if one earlyculture was based on fertility worship at a certain period in history, then itfollowed that all cultures of that time were based on fertility worship. Thisapproach didn't take into consideration the differences in outlook or perceptionthat existed between castes living side by side. Nor did it appreciate the factthat environment and resources change from region to region which, as such, hassignificant ramifications on the social and spiritual development of a people. Basically the thinking was, in blunt terms, that an early or primitive societymust inevitably be thick, brutish and uneducated in comparison to the Christian,industrial culture of the historian, missionary or anthropologist. So it wasthought that the primitive wouldn't have understood the process of conception orbirth and would therefore have worshipped it as a magical act at every givenopportunity, basing their entire spiritual belief system on fertility alone. That kind of attitude was patronising, imperialist, arrogant and ignorant, bornof the worst convictions of a society which itself had been and still isbrutalised by its merchant classes and the greed of their ill-educated divines. Anthropology in general, if one could call it that, arose as a discipline at atime when the Christian west was conquering the rest of the known world. Nowidespread or intrinsic desire to understand the culture or history of otherraces existed at that time because the prime motive in any study was to provewhite Christian superiority prior to or during invasion, colonisation,conversion and exploitation. This meant that indigenous peoples were portrayedas ignorant, sex mad, cannibalistic savages, having ancestors who were alsoignorant, sex mad, cannibalistic savages. In the late twentieth century however, a swing towards a more liberal attitudehas meant that societies are now being studied in greater depth and on their ownterms. Nevertheless, to date, the hangover from our Victorian past means thatsome scholars still haven't quite got the picture. When confronted with anartifact or evidence of a ritual that appears to have a seemingly sexualcontext, they will often automatically label it accordingly and stick it in thepigeonhole marked “primitive fertility worship”. A case in point is the Beth-El stone, which derives from a period in Hebraicantiquity when the Jews were polytheistic and worshipped the goddess. From apatriarchal Christian viewpoint, one that had swallowed the later Jewish conceptof the one male god, the Beth-El Stone was thought to be, as previouslymentioned, a phallic emblem associated with an early manifestation of Jehovah asBehemoth. One scholar, relating the Beth-El to Jehovah, further associated thetwo with a scripture which said “His rocks shall crash together”. The academicmeant that God's Behemothic testicles banged together during the penetration andwithdrawal of the Beth-El phallus, which accompanied God's numerous sex acts. As Jehovah, via Zeus, became the northern Thor, one must assume thatthunderstorms, euphemistically said to be the god banging away with his hammer,are in fact the result of his enthusiastic wedding tackle ricocheting againstitself. Whilst I am prepared to accept that this was a typical Jewish joke, and part ofa colourful and imaginative folk culture of the time, I am hard pressed toaccept it as part of the venal doctrine of a society which manifested itselfduring a phase of fertility worship. People have not changed a great deal in thousands of years and humorouseuphemisms were as much a part of everyday life then as they are now. We are the greatest fools if we take these jokes seriously and then waste yearsof our lives on dour research in compiling so-called scholarly theses whichsoberly explain the finer points of a doctrine that probably originated as ahumorous quip in the equivalent of a Jewish pub, and was thought funny enough toput down on clay, stone or papyrus. On its own the Beth-El, as an anointed stone, is reminiscent of all the blackmonoliths that appeared in mediaeval literature and art as stones that were, ofthemselves, anointed or sometimes baptised, including the 15th-century picture“The Heart's search for Love”. There is no reason why any of them couldn't be a Boga Art, the Goddess' Stone.Their genital context, like that of the Sheelagh Na Gig, has nothing to do withsexual reproduction per se. Indeed, the black stones probably have a componentof their iconography which is, in itself, a symbolic descendant of the Beth-El.This is because they are part of European Grail Lore which has part of itshistory immersed in the Hebrew culture, and further being associated with theGrail itself which is female and Tantric. This would then mean that it hadabsolutely nothing to do with the penis or its progenitive function, or indeedthe reproductive functions of the female sex organs. Both of these have been the subject of common knowledge amongst mankind forthousands of years, making it highly unlikely that every sexual symbol everproduced by so-called primitive or ignorant savages was solely manufactured forthe fertility-cult market. With this and the foregoing in mind it is worthmentioning the ancient Hindu symbols of the Yoni or Vulva and the Lingam orPenis, as another example of simplistic over categorisation. Originally the Lingam was not the phallus. The word Lingam relates to Lingua orspeech and hence the tongue, so this means that the Tantric element of Hinduismand Buddhism relates primarily to the Beth-El and the Grail, and not to sex.When the Yoni was entered by the Lingam, it was an act of transcendence, not ofcopulation. The union intended was with the gods who resided in, or who could bejoined with by imbibing, the blood of the womb. It is entirely possible that Beth-El was once Beth-Elohim, meaning House of theGods, rather than just the House of God. The House of the Gods, the place wherea human being would find the gods and thus by implication attain transcendence,would be the womb. One would find the gods by drinking from the Grail, the Womb.“He who drinks in one draught will see God and the Magdalene”. The gods abided in the blood of the Sacred Womb, which is what the Beth-El wouldsignify, along with all the later cubic stones. With BethElohim we have BethLehem or Bethlehem, the Rath of the Womb of the Great Mother, which accords withBeth Seathan, a Rath or Tel which was a Repha'im temple of Nergal, the god ofthe Otherworld, built by the Scythians in Jordan. The Otherworld is the House of the Gods and hence the Beth-El or Beth Lehem. IfJesus was born in a Beth Lehem, then he was born symbolically in the Otherworldand emerged from the womb of the Rath as a god-king. The story of his being born in a stable which was a cave has a great deal to dowith this symbolism, as caves and Raths were places of the dead. Like the SidheMounds of Eire, they were doorways to Elphame or the Other or Underworld andhere we have a link with Epona, Rhiannon and Slepnir, and with Robin as anequine deity and thus a Priest King. Being born in a Beth-El, Jesus—the Christsonday god of the Witches— was Janus orLittle John, the psychopomp, portal guardian and pontiff or bridge to theOtherworld. His priest kingship has much that is owed to this Scythian, Dragonsymbolism. Here there is also a Mithraic link with the rite of the cave of thewolf (Jesus ben Panther, Son of the Eastern Werewolf) and a link with Apollo orthe Sol Invicta. Jesus would have been a son of the Beth-El, a Son of the Stone. According toOlga Friedenbourg, the Russian writer, these links, with the solar Mithras orMazda, and hence Samael and the biblical Satan, are confirmed in his choice ofan ass upon which to ride into Jerusalem. The ass is the Egyptian Set, whobecame Set-Typhon, or Sataniel-Lucifer the Enlightened and Enlightening One,identifying Jesus as the Buddha Siddharta of the Levant— A Boggart or Fairy. Robin's FatherOberon breaks down into Ober and ron. Here “Ober” can relate to uber meaning“over” or “high”, and “ron” presents itself as being “reyn” or “regin”. Reginrelates to king, therefore Oberon means high or white king. Uber meaningVampire, would render Oberon as “Vampire king”, which, in this particularinstance is not beyond the bounds of possibility; as Vampires, Witches andFairies are all the same beings, and the following, taken from traditionalsources, serves yet again to reinforce this. In the case of Robin, the name might have presented some difficulties had it notbeen for the existence of intentional multiplicity. The name, coming fromRobert, has a root—“Ro” which can be found in Celtic, but also in later Frenchand German, where the meanings expand collaterally. In German the root “Ro” canmean either “fame”, as in Ro-bert, or “power” as in Rod-Erick. As Robert was originally spelt Hrodebert it would seem that the root “Rod” ismore appropriate than “Ro”, which would render Robin or Robert, not as“bright-fame” but as “power-bright” or “might-right”. In Gaelic, Roderick, speltRoderigh (Rod-Righ) means “red-haired king” and has variants in theWelsh—Rydderch or Rhodri, and the Irish—Rhuardhri or Rory. “Rod” as “red” in German would be “rot”, and “Rod” as “power” could derive as itdoes elsewhere, from a Martian association between “red-bloodmight”. This wouldgive us “strength derived from blood”, this being either the possession of acertain bloodline or the ingestion of blood, as was the practice in the royalcovens. Therefore if Hrode, as “Rod” or “ruddy”, means “red” or “red-haired”, inthe particular case of Robin Hood/Artisson/Goodfellow (Puck-Boucca-Bolg), wehave Robin or Robert as “Red-Bright” or the “red-haired bright (or shining)one”. Consequently, as red was the Scythian king's hair colour and a Shining Onewas a Fairy, we would have Robin as the “red-haired Fairy-Dragon-Vampire-Witchking”. This is entirely appropriate to his legendary associations and cultic role,especially as we now know that he, as Robert de Vere, descended directly fromMelusine des Scythes and had a father and grandfather both named Aubrey orAlberich, meaning Oberon, the High Fairy King. The “R” in Robin or Robert wasquite often replaced by an “H” or “D”. This gives the abbreviated “Rob” as Hob,as in Hob Goblin—a Fairy or Demon of the Mines (mounds etc.) and another namefor Robin Goodfellow. Goblin comes from the German Kobelin, meaning a mine, caveor mound (Tepes) dwelling magician-smith (alchemist), and gives us anotherword—Cobalt, a metal which is silver in colour, resembling the colour of Odin'scloak. Cobalt is highly magnetic and, as Cobalt 40, is also extremely radioactive,being used in the “Cobalt Bomb”. Otherwise Cobalt is an essential part of thehuman and animal diet and can be found in spinach, cabbage, lettuce, watercressand liver. Cobalt was used in making coloured glass (alchemy) and was applied,as a coloured glaze, to ancient Chinese porcelain. Consequently, two pigmentsrelevant here can be obtained from it: 1) green, Robin's and the Fairy's colour, and, 2) blue; with a range of hues including, a) ultramarine (meaning “from beyond the sea”, also obtained from LapisLazuli) and b) sky blue, the colour of Odin's hood (OHO: Hood Hod, rel. to Hat) in his roleas Sky or Ml Father, and c) its darker shade Azure (the Persian “lazward”), one of the titles of Kali as“Kali-Azura”. "},{"pageContent":"[images/00056.jpg] Chapter 22 Goblins, Pixies, Sprites and Gnomes Hob Goblin is the name of one individual, rather than pertaining to a class ofsprites. In Hob Goblin or Robert the Kobelin we have: a) Robin-Smith of the Sidhe,b) Robin the Magician,c) Robin of the (eye patch and) Hood,d) Robin the Alchemist. Hereto, the name Robin may also pertain to the bright flame of the smithy'sforge. During the late 1600's to early 1700's, one could be hanged for wearing green.It was the Fairies’ colour, as we know, and represented the amorality of naturewhich is unconscious of and beyond the stunted human, Christian notions of goodand evil. By wearing green, a person was intimating that they were of faerieand, by blood, above the bondage of petty Christian morals, ideals and laws.This meant, more or less, that they had transcended and, as with nature and theCosmos itself, were at one with God. Robin Hoodwas an outlaw, not because he stole from the rich to give to the poor,but because firstly he was Fairy and thereby a Magus. He had transcended humanperceptions and restrictions and because of this, he was by birth outside allhuman laws of existence anyway, as were all those of the Fairy race. The Cyclopsof Greece, members of the Titanic, Fairy race of “giants” were also cave or Rathdwelling miner-smiths who forged thunderbolts (we are reminded of the propertiesof Cobalt-60) for Zeus (the Greek counterpart of Thor). It is generally thought that their name derived, not from “one-eyed”, but from“ring eyed” (cycle-ops), related to the practice of wearing cobalt blue woadbands or rings. Painted around the eyes, Graves reminds us that the rings of theCyclops mimicked those of the sidhe of Eire. It will be remembered that ultramarine and cobalt blue were, respectively, thecolours of Vishnu and his brother/counterpart Shiva (Sidha). Nevertheless, theCyclops were described also as “one-eyed”. The one-eyed epithet is pertinentbecause of the smith's habit of wearing a patch to protect one eye from sparks.(The Fairy hood, as protective headgear, is also part of the alchemical/smithingtradition, and also pertains to the alchemist’s hidden knowledge, kept “underhis hat”.) This gave rise to the idea of the Cyclops being one-eyed giants. This oneeyedaspect in Elven lore also relates to the Irish Balor and his counterpart on onelevel; the Danish Odin. The names hobgoblin, sprite and gnome conjure upstorybook images and memories of A Midsummer Night's Dream, and when we think ofthese characters we think of harmless, mischievous beings. Although we have accused Shakespeare of perverting the true identity of theFairy, it might be advisable to take a fresh look at his motives and bear inmind his own origins. He is guilty of diminution, as are the establishment— theChristian clerics and the academics—but there may be a sound motive behind histhinking. The desire to belittle occurs in the first instance because of threat. It's assimple as that. To the process of the diminution of the Fairy by theestablishment, we can also add the same process as practiced by the peoplethemselves and, strangely enough when you look at it, the process of thediminution of the Fairy, by the Fairies themselves! The Catholic establishment belittled the Fairy because the Dragon Blood posed athreat to that establishment’s hold on government. This is easy to understand.It is more difficult to belittle them if Fairies were supposed to be harmless,friendly beings, or at worst just mischievous pranksters, which is what occurredbetween the late Dark Age to Reformation period, by the wider population of theperiod. The problem was that Fairies weren't just ethereal pygmies, nor werethey just “almost ordinary folk”, which is the picture we might tend to get fromMurray's sympathetically understated description of them. The true nature of the Fairy, one that has already been hinted at, can be foundby studying the various names they were given over time, names which now conjureup images of garden ornaments and wispy elementals. In the past, however, theywere epithets of terror. The last thing you would want in your little patch ofsuburban heaven is the original version of the Garden Gnome. True enough, Fairies loved nature and greenery. They were, after all, thechildren of the Greenwood and descendants of the kings and queens who, at thedawn of history, laid out the Garden of Eden. So it seems appropriate that wehave statues of them fishing in our goldfish ponds or sitting looking sternly atthe lawn that should have been mown a week ago. But the real thing itself was the very reason why the plastic version now holdscourt on patios across the length and breadth of Merrie England. The Gnome was,for man's more recent ancestors, a horrible creature and sometimes a very realthreat to life. This is why it, along with all the other beings we think of asseparate classes of Fairies, was reduced in stature by ordinary people. What do we do if we are beset by problems that we can't get rid of? More oftenthan not, we try to make light of them and ridicule them in order to make themsmaller, thereby alleviating the fear in which we hold them. This was one of thereasons behind the diminution of Fairies by the peasants. Fairies, hard pressedby adverse conditions during the Church's burning times, and because of therelentless expansion of the human population into their territories, oftencontinued old traditions out of a ritual context. No doubt this occurred with a certain imperious callousness, considering thetreatment they were then receiving at the hands of their former client peoples.It has been stated elsewhere that Elves did not steal human adults or childrenfor ritual purposes and this stands true. Nevertheless during the medievalperiod cannibalism was endemic in the whole British population because of thedisasters caused by war, plague and famine. It is warranted therefore that theElves ate what they could, especially as they were additionally a people forcedto the very margins of society. It has become a tradition to put the little folk into classes or categories.However, if we look closely at the etymology and the origins of the words usedto describe each type of Fairy, we will find that, rather than definingdifferences between various types of ethereal pygmy, the words or names describethe different attributes of only one type of being. Robin Goodfellow forinstance is called Hobgoblin, which is another name for a Gnome, which we thinkof as a cute little fellow in a red cap. And indeed he or she probably was, toanother Gnome. In fact the name “Redcap” associated with the fly Agaric or Fairymushroom, was another epithet for the Gnome and the Pixy, which we know was thePict-Sidhe. Perhaps as time passed, the Fairy actually did became smaller in stature thanordinary people. However, as Murray points out, this was probably caused by therestriction in diet which, in turn, was caused by the increasing sparsity ofresources available to them as a people, because of their having to go intohiding from the Church. Nevertheless the Fairy, here described as the “Gnome”, was once a being ofconsiderable stature until he was forced into forest regions that could hardlysupport him and which were, even then, being populated and deforested by farmerswanting to clear the land to provide grazing for sheep and cattle. In Tanzania, exactly the same process is now happening to the Hadza people.These nomadic tribesmen are the last true hunter-gatherers, they keep nolivestock and depend entirely on their fantastic knowledge of the terrain tosupport themselves and their families. Their impact on the environment isminimal and sustainable. To all intents, they live in harmony with nature. Today their range is diminishing even further because agriculturalists andpastoralists from the outside are coming into their lands, cutting down treestock to provide overnight enclosures for their cattle, which they only use oncebefore moving on, thereby overgrazing the entire territory. Because of this theHadza population is dying out and over the last century their numbers havedwindled to no more than a thousand people. This was the fate of the ShiningOnes and it is a story that has been repeated all over the world. "},{"pageContent":"[images/00081.jpg] Chapter 23 The Wise Ones So we have suggested that the Fairies, the “little people” in pre-Christianhistory times were Vampiric by necessity and inclination, and fed purely on theblood of their own kind for magical reasons. But later on, during the one and ahalf millennia following Christ’s death, they were pushed into a corner. Theyalso fed on human blood and the occurrences were frequent enough to become amajor problem for incursive agriculturalists in the second millennium, whoconsequently held the “Gnome” in awe, as an object of fear. In order to copewith the danger of living in Fairy lands, the response of the invader was tobelittle the beings, from once proud Kings to a race who eventually becamedietarily disadvantaged fugitives of the forests, and finally into etherealpygmies that were harmless. As the Fairy populations in each region died out completely, the incomers wereleft with a memory of a small elusive folk who, as time passed, became smallerstill in the mind's eye of those who, though responsible for their genocidewould, nevertheless, rather forget them altogether. The words Gnome, Sprite andGoblin; like Fairy, Elf and Pixy therefore all refer to one race: the Scythiansor Sidheans, and relate to various practices and ritual identities amongst thisonce ancient and noble people. “Gnome” comes from the Greek and is related to the root “gno”. From this sameroot we obtain our words gnosis and gnobilis or nobilis. Both these words relateto knowledge and wisdom, and point to an origin within the Aryan culture. Aryanalso means wise, or “Race of the Wise”, or “the Noble Race” in Sanskrit. A “Gnome” is one of the race of the Wise Ones, the ancient king tribe of theAryans or Scythians. They were the genetic guardians of a blood chemistry, ofrituals and lore from which they derived a perceptual state of gnosis ortranscendence. The Gnome is said to have been a creature of the mines andmounds, just like the hobgoblin. This description, linked both to alchemy and smithing, is also associated withtheir ritual practice of living in specially prepared chambers in burial mounds,tombs and pyramids. This links the Gnome, as a priest-king figure, with the cultof Nergal and the Otherworld or underworld. For this very same reason the Fairyis also called the Sprite. This word is a reduction of the word Spirit and alsohas the same associations with the Scythian practice of regularly inhabitingtombs to obtain knowledge from the ancestors. Gnome (also relating to “judge”) as Nobilis gives us another familiar name forthe Fairies—the Gentry or Noble ones. Gnome also refers to a canon or body oflaw and this is reminiscent of the role of the Pictish-“Pixy”Druidic High-Kingsas custodians of the Law and Culture of their peoples. These Kings, the Brudes or Bruidhes, were the Judge-Poets and magicians whoseexpertise lay in spellcraft, rhetoric and satire. Their female counterparts werethe Bruidhinas, Sirens, Morrigans and Melusines, the Raven women and SwanMaidens, female “Gnomes”, Ban Sidhes—female Fairies—the custodians of wisdom andlaw, weavers of spells and Vampire princesses. This is exactly what Melusined'Avalon was. The “Red Cap” was not associated with the Gnome, Pixy, Sprite, or Goblin becauseof the colour of the mushrooms they were fond of sitting under. Nor was itsolely from the later need for the consumption of human blood as a staple food.It was because they used to dye their hoods or their pointed, Phrygian headgearin menstrual blood which was consumed, along with its precious cargo ofneurotransmitters, to facilitate wisdom. As the cap covers the head, so symbolically the blood feeds the spirit, the souland the intellect, situated in the pineal gland and the “Wings of the Swan” inthe brain. The blood drinking rituals of the Gnome-Goblin-sprite and his or herhabitual occupation of tombs, as god-kings or queens of the Otherworld, led tothe notion of the Vampire as a bloodthirsty ghost. Sprite, then, means Spirit-People, or people of the spiritual realms, those whohave congress with the inhabitants and gods of the Otherworld. It also refers tothe blood-drinking Scythian “Ghost-Warriors” who painted their bodies grey-blueto look like corpses when they entered naked upon the battlefield. Sprite was a name given to Robin Goodfellow or Hood who was also known as Puck,meaning Boucca or Bolg, the God. Sprite therefore expands the meaning to includePeople of the Gods, which is entirely appropriate, as the Fairies, the DragonClan, were the descendants of the original gods of the earth. "},{"pageContent":"[images/00081.jpg]Chapter 24 Elementals and Diminution Given that the Fairies, according to Murray, were still around in Shakespeare’stime (Edward de Vere?), it seems to me that at least one individual who is saidto have been a member of the literary syndicate that produced A MidsummerNight's Dream, belittled the Fairies, his own race. It could be argued that thiswas in order to alleviate the persecution that was raging againstthem—persecution that carried on for nearly two hundred years after his death. This individual used a form of diminution, turning Fairies into elementals, atype of anthropomorphisation, which in reverse is the same as the process ofdeification, turning the ancient priest-kings into the gods. Through thisperson’s influence, the Fairies who traditionally wielded power derived fromtheir understanding of the elemental forces in nature, became associated withthose forces to the extent that they were thought to be the elements themselves.In doing this he instituted a situation in which the Fairies could sidestep outof this world into another, taking them out of human history altogether and thuseventually out of harm’s way. It is possible that his patron, the self-styled “Faerie Queen” Elizabeth I,sympathised with and supported such a move. She was supposed to be marginallydescended from Margaret of Anjou and this house claimed a supposed descent fromMelusine, the High Queen of the Fairies of All Europe who were, like Elizabethherself, the arch enemies of Catholicism. Rob as Hob reinforces the Fairy element in the Robin Hoodstory as does Dob orDobin. Odin's mount—the eight-legged Slepnir (a funeral byre) was similar to theCeltic Rhiannon and Epona. Like Robin's father, Herne or Oberon, who inhabitedthe underworld, the horse deities were also related to the Scythian death cultof Nergal. All three were white (Fairy) horses who carried the rider to thegrave—the Otherworld, the realm of sovereignty and wisdom. Related to this, the funeral byre in Pakistan which is carried by four men(eight legs), is called the Breghi Moru. Similarly Odin had a son called Breghiwho can be related to Robin. Robin was said to be a gifted musician and Bereghiwas a god of music who, like Orpheus, traversed the Underworld or Death. The name often given to a horse was Dobbin and it is feasible that RobinHood—son of Odin/Herne—was, as a Magus, a psychopomp associated with the Celticrealm of death, sovereignty and the horse deities. Robin Hood as Puck wasrelated to the Irish “pooka” as well as the Boucca, from whence comes the Dutch“spook”, meaning sprite or spirit, the Welsh “puca” and the Icelandic “piki”. The “peoka”, was a shape-shifter which often took the form of animals, the horsebeing one of them. Likewise the Witches’ god would often appear in animal form,regularly as a horse, often as a Stag, but also in a variety of shapes accordingto the tribal totem animal traditionally associated with the region or the clanof the officiate/god. The Icelandic “piki” is close to “Pixy” or Pict-Sidhe, a painted Elf; meaningthat piki-puck-boucca-bolg-god indicates the status of RobinHood/Goodfellow/Artisson as a “Puck” or shapeshifting, shamanic, PictishGod-King or Priest-King. Puck is not a name therefore, but a title, related tobogey-man and boggart, a god-man, a Druid prince or priest king. Included in the Dobbin epithet there is also a relation to the origins ofRobin”s ancestors as mounted bowmen. We know from folklore that Robin was both ahorseman and a gifted archer. We know from history that he was neither Normannor Saxon, being of princely Flemish descent and an accomplished veterancavalryman. We also know that the bow wasn't merely a yeoman's weapon and thatthe term yeoman was relative anyway. If one combines the two ideas, those of thearcher and the cavalryman, one arrives at the origin of the Centaur and theSagittarii. The Centaurs were extraordinary mounted archers who were said to have fought atTroy, whilst in other accounts they were said to be, like the Scythians, rapistsand pillagers. The amazing skill of the Thracian horse warrior, whose symbiosiswith his mount seemed to make him a part of the horse itself, contributed to thedevelopment of the image of the Centaur as half man, half horse. It is likelythat the Thracians and the Sarmatians, who wore fish scale armour, wereoriginally related to the Zmei of Russia. The Zmei were mounted, fish-scale or Dragon-scale armoured lords whom the peoplereferred to as Dragons. Like the fabled Centaurs they were wise but brutal and,similar to the legend concerning the Cimmerians, they appeared at night. It islikely that they were descended from the same central European Scythian tribesthat migrated to Britain to become the Picts and the Dalriada, or Horse Lords,from whom Robin Hood partly descends. The Centaur Cheiron was, like all Centaurs, one assumes, the son of Cronos orAnu and the water Fairy Oceanid. This confirms that the Centaurs, the Sagitarii,were Dragon Lords. Cheiron kept a school for princes at Thessaly and was thetutor to Jason, Odysseus and Achilles. The name Sagittarius can be broken into two separate words—Sagitta and Rius orArius. From the root “Sag”, though said to mean arrow from the Latin, are alsoderived the words Sagacious and Sage, both pertaining to wisdom. The lastsyllables Ri-us or Ari-us can mean either: a) king or Rig with Latin male suffix “us”, or b) an arrow.Sagittarii may then mean either “Wise Archers” or “Archer Lords”. Either way itdoesn't matter because both come down to the same thing. Related to Arya and theNoble or Wise Race of Kings, Lord is one of the order of the Nobilis or WiseOnes anyway. We are then back firmly in Scythian Dragon territory and the realmof the horse lords and the King Tribe, with its Gnomes, pixies, sprites, Fairiesand boggarts. As we have seen, Hrodebert was the original spelling for Robert and itsaffectionate diminutive Robin, which gave us Hob and Dob. Another affectionatediminutive of Robert is Robby which, as you might expect, also has an oldvariation which expands upon the story of the link between Robin Hood and hisancient cultic and equestrian roots. The abbreviation of Hrodebert is, as onewould guess; Hrodin or Odin: The Lord of the Rings. The Hobby Horse is a sight familiar to all who have attended the spring fairsand have enjoyed the sight of Morris Men or the Sweeps on surnmer outings tocountry public houses and village fetes in England. In earlier times, the HobbyHorse was a notorious character who accompanied the Coal Black Man,Jack-in-the-Green, Robin Hood and Maid Marion on the Maying, where he was notedfor his lascivious behaviour in chasing and indecently assaulting young villagegirls as they paraded with the May Day throng. Nevertheless, Charles Burlandtells us that the Hobby Horse was a popular figurein those days, before political correctness had been thought up. Then, the onlysocial workers for miles around were likely to have been called either Rosy orMother Demdike. The Hobby Horse and his antics have echoes in the Wild Hunt for Elf maidens atSamhain. Like Herne, Robin and the Witch princesses, or Odin and the Valkiries,the Vampire kings and queens, the Pictish and Scythian horsemen and horsewomenused to roam the forests in a ritual search of their Dragon princesses, whomthey would ritually kidnap and feast upon. In this connection we have the HobbyHorse or Robin o' the Horse and the reinforcement of all the ancient connectionsbetween him and his Fairy cohorts in this world, and their longing to return totheir Otherworld home— Elphame. With regard to the Coal Black Man, some scholars have linked him with the Morrisand both with some fertility ritual originating in Africa, based on thesupposition that Morris was originally spelt Moorish. The Coal Black Man or theSweep is a variant of Jack-in-the-Green. He is black because of the magicalcustom, like Santa Claus, of entering and exiting houses via the chimney which,when the house was a building similar to a Rath or a mound, also doubled up asthe front door. He is linked to the ancient chimney-climbing shaman, to the Witches who flew upchimneys to get to the Sabbat, all blacked up with soot and flying ointmentbased on goose grease. Thus the Witches’ god, the Man-in-Black or Coal Black Manis Odin and St. Nicholas, the Horned God, always accompanied a'Maying by themummer of the Dragon. The Sweep therefore is also Jack or Herne, who is sometimes referred to as theFoliate Man or the Green Man, another name for Robin Goodfellow or Hood, theSprite, Gnome or Pixy. He is the Witches’ god, not from an exotic imported cult,but from the northern lands of Europe. "},{"pageContent":"[images/00010.jpg]Chapter 25 Phrygians and Scythians The Red Cap of the Gnome and the Pixy is the pointed cap associated withWitchcraft and shamanism. Examples of it can be found in Babylonian stonebas-relief depictions of the gods, in burial sites in Takla Makan and elsewherein the Celtic world. In relation to the Gnome or Pixy, this headdress is ofPhrygian origin, where it was once worn with the point folded towards the frontof the head. A portrait of Liberty leading the French Revolution depicts herwearing this same Phrygian Cap. The Phrygians migrated from Thrace, the original home of Dionysus, to landsadjacent to Galatia in central Anatolia around 500 BC. They were probablydescended from the same stock as those earlier Scythians who migrated to Thracefrom Ireland. Returning there they became the Fir Bolg and the Phrygians revereda Goddess Queen of the same Dragon Pantheon from which the Fir Boig of theTuatha de Danaan were descended. This deity, Cybele, was a native of mountainsand forests. Originally known to the Greeks as Rhea, the Titaness and mother ofZeus by Cronos, she can be identified as the Sumerian Antu, wife of Anu, fromwhence the Danaan derive their name—Tuadha d'Anu. The Phrygians also worshipped Mithras who was the Persian god often identifiedwith Mazda. Mithras is often depicted as slaying the “world bull”, whichrepresents what the gnostic dualists call the demi-urge, the subordinate creatorand “Lord of this World”. Cybele as Antu was the Mother of Enlil (who laterbecame Zeus and Jehovah), whilst Mithras as Mazda was originally Enlil's brotherEnki, and Enlil was Ahriman in the Persian dualist cult that revered Mithraswho, like Herne, was associated with the Underworld and caves. Like Mithras,Herne is further linked both to the Stag and the Bull. Enki became Samael andhere we enter the realm of the cult of the twin and the rivalry between theLight and Dark represented respectively by Mithras the bull slayer and thedemi-urge, the bull itself symbol of Mazda-Mithras's brother,Enlil-Zeus-Jehovah. In slaying the bull, Mithras is destroying the world of form and illusioncreated by the language we use to interpret the stimulus received by the humansenses. In one sense human beings are the bull itself, and here we enter thetrue meaning of the Christian message. From the death of the bull is broughtforth new life. From the death of the Christian believer is brought forth newlife in the spirit of Christ. This world of form hides the true nature of existence which is creativity,symbolised by the flowers that issue from the neck wound of the bull.Essentially Mithraism was a transcendent philosophy intended to get people tosee beyond the semantic, material world—the “bull” of Enlil-ZeusJehovah, to theworld of eternity beyond thought and beyond the form defined erroneously bylanguage. The bull features repeatedly in Druidic lore and was sacrificed regularly at theNemetons, the major Druidic gatherings, which were held in Galatia, next door toPhrygia and in Ireland and Scotland. This sacrifice was the Mithraic sacrificeof human delusion, not the sacrifice of a god. The Druids didn't worship anyoneand the bull was definitely no god. The Druids and consequently the Fairies,Vampires and Witches were dualist philosophers, not religious devotees. Inhistory the deities (more properly “cosmic forces”) have been reversed byvarious vested interests and in some variations of the dualist philosophy Enlil,Jehovah-Zeus the Appis Bull, was a symbol of the material world ofnerve-endings. Hence it had the capacity to experience misery and sufferingwhilst Enki, the Dragon of Light or Satan, was the deliverer from pain, theEnlightener. Traditionally Jesus was identified as the Sol Invicta or Mithras, the delivererof mankind—the Enlightener: Lucifer or Satan. He guides the Magus in his questto transform his perception of the material world in order that he may see thateternity and the realm of Elphame lie hidden just beneath the skin of our fearsand opinions, the thoughts that make up our world of suffering. Similarly, theflowers lie hidden in the brutish body of the world bull. The philosophy ofDualism works on two levels, however, and whilst one relates to our perceptionof existence, the other relates to the interplay of those forces which make upthe very life we so often perceive in error. The Phrygian cap worn by Mithras, the badge of transcendence, was the same capworn by all shamans since the Golden Age of the Titans, those Anunnaki(Anunnagi) ancestors of the Dragon Clans. From them emerged the Fairy Race ofthe ancient Dragon and Grail Blood—the Gnomes, Pixies and Sprites. It was oncesaid that the Phrygian devotees of Mithras would soak themselves in the blood ofsacrificed bulls. Anciently, the skull of the bull was used to symbolise thefemale organs. The horns were often tipped with round golden balls and these and the hornsthemselves represented the ovaries and fallopian tubes which were joined to thecranium, which symbolised the womb, a symbolic connection between the brain andthe uterus, or intelligence and menstrual blood. The nasal passage and mouth of the bull represented the vagina. To be soaked inbull's blood, was to be soaked in the blood of the womb. The red cap of both thePhrygian and the Fairy therefore was originally coloured by the blood of wisdom.A garden Gnome will never look the same again.

Also as predicted, they are the monumentalgranddaughters of the sidhe hills: the Beth, the Tel, the Rath, the Kurgan andthe Tepes, the ritual chambers. These are, in turn, also the symbolic caves inthe mountains of the original Carpathian homeland of the Anunnaki where, likeCybele, the Dragon mothers once wandered amongst the forests. These structures, like the caves themselves, were used to bury the dead.Adjacent to the main burial chamber was a sleeping chamber where members of theClan would spend the night in order to obtain information from the ancestors indreams. Here we have the origin of one of the Irish words for Vampire:Crechaire, meaning tomb, shrine, sepulchre. The Crechaire or Tomb Dweller was aDruidic, Fairy God-King or Queen who, as the mediator between this world and theOtherworld, would reside in the sleeping chamber of the Rath, next to theancestors. The image of the Vampire as one who lives in tombs is thereforecorrect. Tomb dwelling was common amongst the Egyptians and Sumerians, andconsequently we have another cultural Fairy link between these peoples and theScythian Pict-Sidhes. Another reinforcing link also appears between the Vampireand the Smith, the Alchemist, the Magi, the Fairy or Titan, Robin Hood and Odin. The shapeshifting Robin or Puck, shares this shamanic attribute with Merlin andwith Odin/Hodi/Wolden, who also shares his knowledge of alchemy and forging, andhis one-eyed attribute with the Cyclops. They were the Titanic Fairy smiths whoso closely resemble the Irish Sidhe and Balor of the Formorians, who were theformidable giants (often described as one-eyed), said to have been descendantsof Ham. In legend, part of the wave of Scythian migrants who settled in Eire decampedand fled for the Northern Isles of the World. This is obviously Scandinavia andit is interesting to note that on their return to Ireland they established theirFairy reign as the Tuatha de Danaan. It seems probable therefore that the Danes and the Danaan are directly related.This would explain the link between Odin, later the “antecessor” god of theScandinavian Witches, and Robin Hood or Hodin, Robin (Artis-son) being of Irishorigin via the Picts. It appears that Robin, buried in an Oak Tree, Odin hanging from an Ash Tree andJesus nailed to the Rood or Holly Tree are culturally related to each other, asshamans and as Druidhes or Wallimen (men of the trees). This was a name of theWitches’ god in the Viking isles of Orkney. In Britain, the Witches’ god wasoften dressed as Odin and in the Orkneys it would be Odin who is Walliman orUalla-man, a word related to Uilidian, the Irish Sacral Royal House of the FirBolg (Boucca/Puck/Robin), who settled in Scotland. In Gundestrop in Denmark a cauldron was unearthed upon which was embossed thedistinctly Celtic figure of Cemunnos or Heme, Lord of the Forests. He waswearing torcs [variants of the Ring] and sitting cross-legged, holding a serpentor Dragon in each hand, another Ualla-man and the father of Robin Hood. Thecauldron is a common symbol in Celtic lands and always associated there withblood and the Grail. Similarly, the Gundestrop Cauldron is considered to havebeen a vessel for catching the blood of victims sacrificed to the Danish gods,Odin the Ring Lord being the father of them all. Sacred to Odin were the Ravenand the Wolf. Similarly, the companions of Merlin at Hart Fell were the Raven,the Wolf and the Boar, being symbolically a Morgana (a Morrigan or Bruidnina), aWarrior and a Druid, who probably fled with Merlin following the battle in whichhis patron Gwenddolau was killed. The Wolf and the Raven are also connected tothe cult of Mithras. It is likely that Odin and Merlin, though not the same person, were closelylinked as royal priests of Druidic castes. They performed similar invocationalfunctions and shared similar attributes within a religious tradition thatoriginated from the early Eurasian dualistic cult from whence arose the Druids,the Parsi, the Magi and the Brahmins. Odin was a Seer and Merlin means Seer.This being the case, then, the legendary relationship between Merlin and Arthur(and Lancelot) is the same as the relationship between Herne/Odin and Robin (andLittle John). Both, in a cultic sense, are late aspects of the Monarchic dualistic concept ofthe triad or trinity and the cult of the twin, which began with Arin-Enki-Enlil.This has established a Dragon Culture whose symbolism, ritual practice and royalpriesthood has lasted 7000 years and included Jesus as an apostolic successor ofcollateral blood descent. The Danaan were sidhe or Fairies, which are Druidhes or Witches (derived fromthe Old English Wic/ca) and we know that these descriptions are aspects of oneidentity. Similarly the word Viking is derived from the word Wic, mistakenlythought to derive from Old Fresian—an inlet dweller. The word actually comesfrom the same Old English word as Witch does— Wicca, meaning to yield or bend,as the Christianised Saxons would have it— “to demons”, which is a Greek word(daemons) and means gods or intelligences. From this can be inferred that they obtained Otherworldly wisdom, as yielding orunderstanding—to “stand under” or “give way to”. Therefore we can render Vikingas Witch. In Celtic, Druidhe is also a Witch. This goes some way in explainingthe close similarity between the Danish Odinic Nine World or Sphere system setagainst Yggdrasil; and the Druidic symbol of the Apple Tree. The Apple Treebears the spherical fruits, the Chakras or Sephiroth, which is what the VikingNine Worlds are. As the Danaan are Sidhe, so the Vikings also had their Siddhirsor weavers of dreams. The Danish Vikings were generally an egalitarian people who operated a socialsystem not unlike the Danaan of Ireland, who considered all of the blood to beequal. Both the Danaan and the Danes were Kings’ tribes. The latter, in the 11thcentury, were invited to provide princes and rulers for a foreign land, such wastheir expertise in management and their love of order. Hence the originally Danish, Svei Ruotsi Clan migrated to Novgarod and foundedwhat is now known as the Russian empire. This occurred at the height of theirpower when, with an entire population of little more than 300,000 people, theDanes brought peace to the warring Slavs of Russia, settled in America andtraded for gold, spices and silk as far away as the Indian Ocean. Their markedly Celtic/Scythian artwork and jewellery is some of the finest inEurope and forges a link between them and their cousins, the Irish and PictishScots descendants of the original Danaan Clans. Whilst examples of ornate Vikingmasonry can be found in Constantinople, at home the Vikings tended to live ingrass-covered halls often carved into hillsides. These are strongly reminiscentof the Raths or Sidhe Mounds of Ireland and Scotland, as are the prolific amountof stone circles one can find in Scandinavia. A Dragon people with Dragon ships,(cc Tiamat, the Sea Dragoness) the symbol is everywhere in Danish art. Theirelite warriors, the Berserkers or Bare-Shirts, took Amanita Muscaria and foughtnaked in the same way as the Celtic warriors of the British Isles and Gaul,neither having any fear of death whatsoever. "},{"pageContent":"[images/00024.jpg]Chapter 27 Steel Bras and Winged Hats As the Valkirie maidens dispatched the Danish warriors to Valhalla, so also theRaven women of the battle field, the Morrigans of the Celts, dispensed releasefrom this world to Celtic friend and foe alike. From Raven we obtain the wordRavenous, which is akin to the blood frenzy of the Morrigans or Morganas in thetheatre of war as they drank the blood of the fallen. The Raven women, theMorganas, are the Baobhan Sidhe, the Vampire Fairies. Off the battlefield theybecome the Leannan Sidhe, beautiful Fairy maidens like the Countess of Salisbury(The Maid of Kent), who was called La Belle Dame Sans Merci and acted as theQueen of Fairies and Witches in England. Those away from the field of bloodshed drank dry the life force of their humanlovers. Along with the Ban Sidhe-Melusine, the serene and graceful ladies of thelake and guardians of the sacred Meres and secret fountains, are the legendarySwan Maidens, the Valkirie of the Danes. The Priests of Odin were called the Godthi, which is pronounced Gothi. PerhapsOdin as Woden, the god of the forest dwelling Goths, is Woden the Wood Lord orWolden or Wooden (Uailaman) and the Goths themselves were, like the Danaan, atribe of Priest Kings. Where Godthi and Goth means “men of the god” or priests,so does Fir Bolg or Bog, and so again we have a clear etymological link betweenthe Druids and the sacred priests of Odin. It is feasible that from Denmark settlers moved south, taking the Valkiries(known in Ireland and Scotland as the Swan Maidens) and the Ravens of Odin withthem. Odin, who has at least 30 other names, was originally a Priest King namedWaeldeg or Waldeg (Wald = wood, forest) who married the daughter of theDalriadan king of Ireland, Cormac Mac Art. We are instantly reminded of RobinArtisson. In ancient Irish, “Art” meant stone, which could refer to a mason (cf. HiramHabiff and the Solomonic link) or to the Grail as the “Stone” that fell toEarth, the Lia Fail, the jewel from Satan's Crown, the Lapsit Exillis, the CubicStone of the Holy Vampire Grail. It might also refer to cobalt. Odin was Lord of the Wild Hunt in which he was accompanied by his coven, thetwelve Valkirie. In Celtic Britain the Wild Hunt part of the mythology ofWindsor Great Park was led by Herne and his pack of redeared, white (albe orFairy) hounds. In Anderson's Genealogy there is a table of the kings of theHerulii. It is thought that this tribe of priests-magi were descended from theDanish Gothi of Odin and formed the link between the Goths and the ScandinavianDan tribe. Herulii is composed, it would seem, of two words, Her and Ulii.Whilst Her is obviously Herr, meaning Lord, Ulii is reminiscent of Ualla andWalloon, which is the name of the Frisian people who occupy the regionoriginally inhabited by the Herulii and the Chattoi (forest Panther) tribes. Itappears then that the Herulii—as Her-Ulii, the sacred priests-magi, (theDruidhes, the “Men of the Trees”, were also called magi), are the Lords of theForest and relate directly to the Caledonian Picts, who were the Calle Daouine,the People of the Forest. So it would appear that the Goths could be of Danaan descent via the Danes andthe Herulii, giving a link between Odin and Balor/Herne/Merlin, meaning that theGothi and the Druids are indeed cast from the same mould. If the Goths were theGodthi, sacred priest-kings of the Scythian Dragon, it would explain why theMerovingians formed alliances with Gothic princesses. The Goths inhabited the vast, mysterious forests of central Europe where thetops of oak trees of some thirty feet in diameter formed a canopy of up to onehundred and fifty feet in height. This gave the impression, mimicked in Gothicarchitecture, that the observer was in the midst of a vast natural cathedral ormany-pillared hall. Forests like this once spanned the length and breadth of thecontinent and its islands, including Ireland, Wales, Scotland and England. It would be easy then to imagine that the Scythian tribes, though dispersed byvarious migrations into different regions in the north, would develop alongsimilar cultural and spiritual lines that continued to Mica. They would controland emphasise the environmental conditions of the regions they chose to occupy,namely their natural and historical habitat, the great forests and the ancientgreenwoods. "},{"pageContent":"[images/00027.jpg]Chapter 28 In Forests Dark and Deep In the German Rhineland, Wotan reigned as chief of the gods and Lord of the WildHunt. The Ring myth was prominent and the Swan Knights and Maidens were anintrinsic part of Gothic and Teutonic folklore. Wotan or Odin held court withhis twelve Valkiries, making a Coven of thirteen priests of the old religion;and the Rhinemaidens and the Nixes, like the Melusines and the Morganas, abidedas the guardians of Fairy fountains and forest rivers, brooks and meres. Byunderstanding that these myths emerge from a common genetic and cultural source,which is manifest in these islands as well as on the mainland, we can greatlyexpand on our own appreciation of the finer details of the Dragon Tradition andthe Fairy History in Britain. In assessing numerous Irish, Welsh and Scottish legendary figures and events andcomparing them with those on the continent, our aesthetic appreciation of therichness of our own Fairy culture is deepened in hue and in the clarity of itsoutlines. In the depths of the vastness of the forest, Odin the Ring Lord and the twelveValkyies reflected the myths of Robin Goodfellow and his twelve Witches. Odin'sor Wotan's hall of heroes in that deep dark forest mimics the refuge of Robinand his valiant outlaws with their own Val-Halla or WalHalla, their own Hall ofTrees, set deep in the heart of the Greenwood of Merrie England. In a 12th-century manuscript, Odin is described as a trinity. Despite thepossible Christian influence upon the writer, the god actually does appear tohave been a late tripartite, composite figure. More likely, however, is thatOdin, a Prince Priest representing a bipartite deity, had his own attributesadded, by chroniclers or devotees, at a later date to form a trinity. In thissense, the actual name of the high priest incarnating the god or manipulatingthe creative force was eventually attributed to the god or force itself. Itsname was then forgotten, if it had one in the first place. In this way, behind Odin, Wotan, Herne, Jesus, Robin and a host of other gods,there may simply be one god or force with many aspects, represented by adifferent named or titled priest or priestess in different regions. In all otherrespects, the priests were all the same kind of people performing the sameritual function, arising from the same bifurcated cultural roots. The first two aspects of Odin the “god” were Frey, who appeared during the earlyhunter-gatherer period, and Thor, who found popularity at a transitional periodbetween pastoralism and agriculture—agriculture being something that the Celtswere accomplished at but their overlords, the Danaan king tribe, the ScythianFairies, could never master. Odin's particular areas of influence came toinclude the forces of sorcery and war, which might have reflected a move towardsthe raid or trade practices common amongst earlier Scythian and laterScandinavian peoples. Oddly enough, Odin, at one stage in his career, was alsocalled upon as a god of mortal love, probably because of the Wild Hunt and thequasi-sexual practices within Royal Vampiric Ritual. However, he is identified with Mercury, or Hermes in the Greek Pantheon, both ofwhom were messengers of the gods, as a guardian of portals and a psychopomp.Like Robin and St. Nicholas, they were also the patrons of thieves. Whilst theNordic Taranis, Thor, is thought to compare with ZeusDispater or Jehovah, Freyis identified with Diana's brother, Apollo. Some confusion exists over who camefirst, Odin or Thor, with some commentators asserting that Thor was the son ofOdin. By studying his function and identity in other cultures, it is easy to see thatOdin started out not as a god but as a priest-prince, performing exactly thesame mediatory function as any other Scythian intermediary priest from whateverbranch of the greater Dragon Tuadhe. As an aside, Tuadhe is pronounced Teetha orTootha, meaning an Overtribe or nation. In this it is easy to see that theDragon's Teeth, sown by Cadinus against Jason and the Argonauts, representedScythian warriors of the Dragon Tuadhe or nation. In the fable The Teeth, a playon words, they were sown in the sand and rose up as skeletal soldiers,reminiscent of the grey-blue, blood-drinking ghost warriors of the Scythiannorth. In the mediatory sense, Odin's story is no different to that of Draculaor in fact Christ, who also acted as a priestly, human intercessor, only tobecome identified with the Cosmic force. His close associate, Prince Vlad IV,also became deified in popular folklore as the Prince of Darkness, Satanhimself. The Wild Hunt appears in Vampire lore and the association of the Valkiries withfunctions other than attending the fallen in battle, suggests that they were notnecessarily Valkyria in the limited sense, but that they also had an earlierrole in the mystical rituals of the northern tribes. The first syllable, Val,which scholars appear to associate with the Roman “Vallar”, a wreath given tovictors, may be an erroneous Latinisation. If that is the case, it would lead usback into the deep dark forest, because Val or Wal, in the language from whichthe word Valkirie originally comes, is related not to heroism, but to Wald orWold. In respect to the second part of the word—Kyrie—which seems related to the wordKeuz—”to choose”, we have a number of related themes associated with the givenmeaning. Of some of them, “pick”, “select” and particularly “hunt” do not seementirely inappropriate. The traditional task of the Valkiries, apparently, wasto choose selected fallen warriors from the battlefield. It was taught laterthat they would conduct them to Valhalla where these heroes and Odin would feasttogether. It should be remembered that an earlier manifestation of Odin was Frey and ithas been suggested that Valhalla was once the Hall of Frey and his sisterbride,Freja. The specially selected warriors whom the Valkiries took to Valhalla wereonce intended, so it is said in older traditions, to become repast for thisparticular Goddess, who fed on their souls. “We would be delighted to have youfor dinner” might not have necessarily been an invitation to accept hospitality. We will remember that in Celtic battles the Morrigans administered the coup degrace. They dispatched the fallen by drinking their blood and decapitating them.If we completely Latinise the word Valkirie we obtain Val, meaning victor, andKyrie, which is related to mercy. This combined meaning forms the basis of theidea behind the coup de grace. We may further recollect that the purpose behindthis was based on the idea that the spirit of a person whose body had been thusmutilated was bound to this plane of existence. Doubtless the Morganas gavethese heads to their tribal chieftains who had also drunk blood and hunted forheads themselves, which they had then, as Tacitus attests, either nailed to thelintels and posts of their own Valhalla's, or had kept lovingly preserved indisplay chests. By doing this, they added the spirit and strength of the fallen warrior to theirown, both via the blood consumed on the field of conflict and by later consumingthe soul from the head. These corrupted late practices fall into the category ofmartial vampirism, whichever way you dress it up. There is nothing to suggestthat the Valkiries played any different a part in Nordic or Gothic lore than theMorganas did in Celtic tradition. It seems highly likely that Valhalla was aforest temple, though originally little different to a Scythian chieftain'shall. Close to the Grecian Lamia was the figure of the Dragon-tailed woman Medusa,whose hair was a mass of writhing serpents. Both presaging Melusine, theserpentine Lamia gave her name to a class of female Vampire in Romania, whilstthe Medusa's hair was reminiscent of the wild flailing Elf locks or dreadlocksof the Morganas or Morrigans. From a short way off these looked like a head ofslithering snakes as, in a frenzy of lust, the Morganas or Valkiries bled thedying and took their heads to the Halls of Feasting. Here the souls of thefallen, imprisoned in their skulls, were kept to feed the body and spirit of theearly God-King Frey, whose priest was once Odin, and the Goddess Queen Freja,whose priestesses were once the Valkiries. The activities of the Valkiries were not just restricted to the battlefield. Inthe Wild Hunt, accompanying Odin, they would hunt for their own kind, Elf Women,to feed on. In so doing, they fed the god and goddess they incarnated. The WildHunt is similar to the Dyonisia of Greece and the Bacchanalia of Rome. Thus the Val-Kyrie was a northern Bacchante, a Forest Hunter, and Odin was theBacchus or Dionysus, the Forest Lord of the North. This practice however,wouldn't necessarily be murderous, but would have comprised the corpus of thetradition of Royal Vampirism. It formed the basis of later Witch tradition inthe noble covens of Britain, where Herne and Robin conducted the Wild Huntthemselves with the Witches, with joyous hearts and mirthful songs. At this kind of Sabbat, records of which exist from 17th-century Scottishaccounts, the Noble Witches fed their Lord on their own blood. It must besuspected that this ritual is a leftover from a time when both the Valkiries andthe Morganas fulfilled the same function, by filling themselves with blood.After the Wild Hunt or the battle perhaps they took it back with them, so tospeak, to where its spirit and vitality was let from their own veins to feed theOdin, the god-king in Valhalla, the Temple of the Greenwood and the ForestGroves. Odin was later known as the “Sky Father” and is reminiscent of Anu, whilst Thoridentifies with Enlil, and Frey shares similarities with Enki. Here we have alate and perhaps confused dualistic triad which, comprised of two figures and amediator, compares with the original pattern that first set the trend for thewhole Dragon Tradition. By looking at the various triads through history, it ispossible to construct an apostolic succession of mythic gods-incarnate (HighPriest-Kings) with a close descent. "},{"pageContent":"[images/00025.jpg]Chapter 29 Dualism and Christianity The Figures: Anu, Kether, Brahma = Mediation, Balance. Zirvan, Chronos, Lucifer, Odin, Merlin, Oberon, Herne,Arawn, Jehovah, Ra, Isaac, Joseph, Aubrey = Space-time, Potential. The Figures: Enki, Ormuzd, Prometheus, Jesus, Frey, Arthur, Robin,Pwyll, Chokmah, Vishnu, Christ, Osiris, EsauRobert = Light, Kinesis, Expansion, Expression, Fire, Heat, Yes.

There being no such process as destruction, theapparently opposed forces work both in conflict and in harmony to producechange. In both are elements of the other, represented in the yin and yangsymbol. In the objective observation of these processes of expansion and contraction wesee movement and define this as Space-Time, a phenomenon which arises from thedynamic interplay of forces, but also provides the setting or potential fortheir relationship to each other. In the mediatory sense, both forces emanatefrom the one potential or balancing force, whilst the extent of the activity ofeither force is determined by the mass or extent of the potential itself. Ultimately the forces are impersonal and beyond moral hypothesis. This being thecase, in order to make them understandable and accessible, numerous esotericphilosophical expressions have been publicised in exoteric forms that wereintended to enable people to get to grips with a few of the profound ideas beingexpressed. Invariably, the people, over the course of history, have responded by turningthese ideas into “gods” and, instead of trying to understand them, haveanthropomorphised them and elected priests, whom they also later deified, toassist in their worship. Buddhism is an ideal example of this process. TheBuddha Siddinarta, a Royal Brahmin, stated emphatically that there were no gods,only forces, so people turned Buddha into a god and worshipped him instead. In the case of Dualism, and in this last example, that of Catholic Christianity,the people have relatively recently decided, aided and abetted by unscrupulousChristian priests, that the two opposing forces of Light and Dark must be eithergood or evil. This is because of the way humans are, or rather the way thepriests would like us to see ourselves. Having had the forces anthropomorphised,it seems inconceivable that they could exist without some moral imperative andhence some kind of motive or raison d'etre. The moral quality of either force seems governed by the consensus of religiouslyguided popular preference reinforced by propaganda. Similarly, the expansionpotential of either force in Christianity is governed not by natural law, but bythe projected personal ambition or desire of the body of believers. This isinvariably for ease and security. However, this is not how the universe works. Therefore, the priests havemodified people's expectations by turning the forces of darkness into thearch-enemies of the forces of light. This means that people cannot always expectto live in prosperity because nasty old Satan, the enemy of all that is Good andGodly, is forever trying to upset the boat. In turn, the priests have assured the righteously expectant that the God ofLight, Jehovah, is ultimately all-powerful and will defeat evil in the end.Let’s assume that good and evil existed as morally motivated forces. This wouldmean that as soon as the force of containment and definition, the dark force ofso-called evil, is finally vanquished by the Great and Good God of Light, theentire universe as we know it would expand and express itself without eitherlimit or definition. Indeed if “God” were more powerful than “Satan” this would happen anyway and wewould simply vanish in a puff of indefinability. From the point of view of areligion based on motivation, in this case Fear, there is no point in sayingthat the forces are balanced because balance implies that there is ideologicallynothing to fight for. If both forces define parameters and are in balance, both are essential to themaintenance of life. If this is the case, neither can be sinful. Without sin,you don't have a hook into the people or a big stick to beat them with. The essential elements in the success of late Christianity, as a way for a lazyminority to take control of a majority and their material resources with theleast amount of effort, are fear and confusion. In a sense the way was alreadypaved for ecclesiastical exploitation because sadly, the majority of people arealso either inherently lazy themselves or neurochemically inept and will not, orcannot, think for themselves. This is generally the case—otherwise there wouldn't be any politicians. Understandably, most people just want to get on with their immediate lives andattend to the upkeep of their comfort zones. The most they expect from religion,if anything, is to be assured that things can't or won't get any worse. They welcome leaders, religious or otherwise, as a way of shifting thedecision-making process onto someone else. Arising from their ranks in about 300AD there emerged, in response, an equally inept and slothful group offreeloaders who saw an opportunity to get as much out of life as they could, forthe least amount of personal effort. They were able to achieve this by virtue ofthe inbuilt incapacity or lethargy endemic within the population as a whole. They were secure in the knowledge that the majority of people were notinterested enough to figure out that they, the self-appointed divines, weretricking them. Therefore these early Christian priests modified the philosophyof Dualism to render it imbalanced. They introduced the Gentile population tothe concepts of Mortal Sin, the Prince of Ultimate Evil and the surety ofeternal suffering and damnation. It is quite possible that many of them actuallycame to believe this themselves. This created a gap in the market, a gapcharacterised by new fears. Surprisingly enough, the parvenu priesthood of thenascent, exoteric form of the Christian faith had the power to assuage, at aprice. This example of exoteric Dualism with conscious, motivated forces, in theform of gods as anthropomorphisations of universal principles, owes itsemergence to the same inherent laziness, indifference or incapacity of mindwhich is responsible for the decline of factual ancient history into the realmof myth. Writing in 300 BC, Euhermerus pointed out that the ancient gods and goddesseswere originally great men and women of renown who had undergone the process ofdeification. This is shorthand for the process whereby a people forget theiroriginal goals and the finer detail of the stories from their past. The process,in which whole chunks of heritage are disregarded for one reason or another andhave to be best-guessed by later generations, is called myth-making. The ancient gods and goddesses were flesh and blood beings and the word “god”had altogether different connotations than those that it has now. In thoseancient times the “gods”, essentially the priest-kings and priestessqueens ofthe people, were responsible for a variety of functions, not least that of beingthe shepherds and teachers of their client tribes. In this capacity the “gods”performed plays or rituals in which they were expected to be the incarnaterepresentatives of the forces they depicted in the rites they enacted for theedification or blessing of the people. The passage of time and the absence of a standard of oral teaching ensured thatright up to the last millennium the Druids still didn't worship “gods”. Becauseof this, many other races came to believe that the priest-kings and priestessqueens who incarnated the universal forces were in fact those forces themselves. The net result of this process of forgetfulness was that the impersonal forcesof the Cosmos and the elemental animistic, pantheistic forces of client tribestook on the everyday characteristics of the priest-kings and priestessqueens.They in turn became deified and secondarily associated with lower, animisticelementals because they had become identified with the forces they representedin a ritual context. This would have tended to occur amongst the laity,particularly where these forces or elementals were perceived in relation to thepriesthood as a result of the use of phytological, hallucinogenic drugs duringceremonies, for example. The ancient gnostic, Hermetic philosophy of Dualism has generally becomeidentified with the slightly later Cult of the Twin, precisely because of thismythic process. At the same time, the Fairy kings and queens have becomeassociated with the dryads, sylphs and undines commonly associated withdrug-induced states and vice versa. The primal dual forces of increase and decrease became confused with two ancientbrothers, Enki and Enlil. One was a genial and amicable fellow who favoured man,whilst the other detested human beings altogether. Both were God-Kings of thesort hereto described. The friendly, helpful one—Enki, by a process of human projection, becameassociated with the force of increase and “Good” as one would expect, givenhuman nature. However, the other, Enlil, became hated and feared, ultimately tobe likened to the force of decrease and “Evil”. Whilst the family anddescendants of the two brothers remained aware of the fact that these two boyswere not Cosmic Forces in themselves, other tribes and their descendants, on theother hand, developed, and continued with, and embellished upon theanthropomorphisation. These two brothers had a domestic squabble one day and as a consequence of this,several thousand years later, the Cosmos is described as being divided into twoconflicting sections, one “Good” and one “Evil”, according to one’s tastes andexpectations. Early on, the two brothers had attracted two factions, each onedemonising the other. The stronger, or, it might be said, the more fearful faction won the day and theso-called “Evil” brother, by this time a Cosmic Force, had been cast in the roleof the God of Light. The other, however, who had originally been the nice andhelpful one, became, in the minds of millions, the epitome of moral destitutionand desolation. The faction that thought Enki was a decent fellow were known as gnostics andsome of them believed he was a transcendent God. The factions that called EnkiSatan and cast his misanthropic brother in the role of the transcendent GodJehovah, the God of Light, were known as Jews and Catholics. The faction thatknew Enki was an ancestor of theirs and not a god were called Druids andWitches, whilst the faction that knew that Enki's descendant Jesus was anancestor of theirs and wasn't a god either, were called Celtic Christians,Cathars, Albigensians and Witches. Typical also of human nature, other than going after the main chance and theeasy option, is to dislike being in error or backing the wrong horse. Peoplewant to be associated with winners and in pursuit of this aim it becamenecessary for one of these lately superannuated characters to become thestronger, ultimately victorious one. They also wanted scapegoats. The only people who seemed particularly bothered by this were the Jews and laterthe orthodox Christians, with their deliberately imbalanced interpretation ofearly Christian doctrine. By a twist of fate, the doctrinal perversion gainedimperial sanction, for political expediency as much as anything else. Itssomewhat pedestrian, grossly manipulative and opportunistic view of life becamewidely adopted, aided greatly by fire, the sword, threats of torture—and tortureand death itself. Railing against such a view were the Manicheans, the Arians, the Nestorians andnumerous other pre-Nicaean Christians. For them, Jesus, like Enki, with whomthey identified, was not a god. Nor was he the son of God. In the fullness oftime, however, this inconvenient opposition was dealt with in the manner towhich we have become accustomed, as far as the Catholics are concerned. As a result, the legacy of their religious ambition has left us with a lopsidedform of monarchic Dualism where Jehovah is God, Jesus is the Light. The reversedSatan or Enki, rather than being the essential facility of restraint, is insteadthe quintessential manifestation of absolute evil. In Christianity there can be no reconciliation and no compromise. The cult ofJoy from Death has become the cult of the Fear of Death. Satan, the weaker enemyof all that is “Good”, will finally be crushed and obliterated at the end oftime. The earlier forms of Dualism, some represented in the other foregoingexamples, even though sometimes they might have confused the issue and gone infor a bit of deification, generally understood Cosmic reciprocity and unity. Forthem each aspect of the Cosmos was related and reconciled with the other,forming an eternal and infinite whole. Christianity however, stands alone in demanding that mankind believe in twounequal, bitter enemies who are neither part of each other nor work together orcompliment each other. Supposedly therefore, as “God” is separate from Hiscreation, so also is He separate from the Dark Side for whose creation, by theirChristian logic, He is ultimately responsible for, since He is the superiorbeing. Not only is such an attitude cowardly and irresponsible, God's minions deflectany blame for “evil” from their Master to another unattached, intentionallywicked entity and to those people who are weak enough to succumb to itstemptations. Furthermore, this attitude creates a religious mentality that isriddled with fear, bitterness and multiplicity. The truly sinister aspect ofthis whole situation however, is that the irresponsible and cowardly, divisiveand paranoid, self-hating spirit of corruption which rests at the heart ofChristianity, does so with the express intention of its hierarchy, who arefurther committed to ensure that it remain there permanently. Without it, peoplecannot be controlled and without social control, the Catholic priesthood losesits access to unlimited wealth. In Mithras we have an example of symbolic conflict in Dualism which intends thatin the destruction of one principle by another, the two may be united andtogether transcend. The same dynamic is found in the story of Morgan le Fay andHolger Dansk. The whole point about Dualism on the personal level is not one ofexacerbating strife or perpetuating violence, as it is in post-NicaeanChristianity, but of healing it and going beyond the very elements of humanperception that cause it in the first place. In this respect the Dualism of theDraconian Fairy culture and all its collateral branches demonstrates a farearlier origin than that of modern, imbalanced, post-imperial Christian Dualism.In tracing a line of blood descent for the Fairy race, we also trace a line ofapostolic succession for its original Magean, dualist prince-priesthood, a linewith many collateral family branches. "},{"pageContent":"[images/00005.jpg]Chapter 30 Morrigan and Morgana The following is partly a collection of etymologies based on the themes thatsuggest themselves in association to ritual identities. These two names are thesame, one being a reduction of the other. The name Morgan is said to mean “seabright” in Welsh, but the Morrigan or Morgana is Irish Scots. Accepting this,the following origins for the names are offered. 1) Morrigan: broken down into three syllables, Mor-Rig-An a) Mor: this word in Gaelic means Mountain, Hill, Rath, Barrow, Creachaire,High. b) Rig: this only translates to Righ, meaning Royal or King or Queen. c) An: asin Anu. However, as Gan or gang, we have “going”. Consequently, we have Morriganas: Mori—a “Fate” or Fairy and High Queen of Anu, or Queen of the High Way, as inQueen of Heaven or the Sky, or even, if a Latinisation of Mor has appeared asMori meaning death—Queen of Death's way, meaning perhaps Queen of theOtherworid. When reduced to Morgana we have Mor-Rig-Anu, High Queen of Anu. With bothspellings, either way we have a High Queen of the Dragon. Whereas with the WelshMorgan, we might have Morgana as the Sea Dragoness. Finally, though, the construction would comprise of two linguistic roots, theWelsh and the Scotic. We could have the Welsh Mor as bright or shining or sun,and Gan as Gang meaning to go, path, way. This would give the epithet “TheShining Path”, the road to Elphame, as in “Morgana is the path to Elphame” or asin “The Fairy Way, Route or Path”. In whatever sense, they all combine, because the Shining Path is the sundappledbow wave of the Swan Barque, sailing across the Mere to Avalon at sunset,carrying Morgana the Dragon Queen of the Waters. Hence Morgana as Sea-Bright. "},{"pageContent":"[images/00010.jpg]Chapter 31 Takla Makan With regard to the Mummies of the Takla Makan, although the shamanka's headdresswas shown to be the conical hat of the Witches, the headgear of the Tochariansin general was the conical hat with the rounded end which, when bent forward,becomes the Phrygian Cap. This cap is also shown in relation to the Scythians ona bas-relief stone carving of them presenting gifts to the Persian emperor. TheTocharians have been in Takla Makan since 1200BC. Academics believe they came from the Steppes of Greater Scythia, formingpart of an easterly and westerly migration of the Scythian Peoples. This is the movement of the Danaan nation at that period, part of which ended upin Ireland and eventually Scotland, where they became the Picts. It is even morefeasible to suggest therefore that Tocharian “A” script is closely related toPictish, and hence Fairy. It is now thought that the Scythians of Takla Makancame from Thrace. This would mean that they had much in common with the ScythianFir Bolg. It also means, if this is the case, that both languages are indeedArshi Kantu, Arya-Sidhe Canto, or Aryan Sidhean Chant, and are themagical-religious singing languages both of the Buddhist priests and shamanicpriestesses of the Tocharians, and of the Pictish and Irish Druids. A cursory look at the written script reveals close similarities between writtenTocharian and carved Pictish. It is now thought that the Tocharians weresemi-nomadic, mounted bowmen who operated the same raid or trade policy as theirPictish cousins in northern Europe. Living on the edges of Takla Makan, they occupied the mountains and rich uplandpastures to the north of the desert region. In this they are identical to theScythian bands so often confused with the Celts in Britain and Eke. They arealso probably the ancestral cousins of the tattooed Scythian Chieftain, foundburied in permafrost a few miles north in lower Siberia. "},{"pageContent":"[images/00064.jpg] PART THREE Chapter 32 Additional Fairy Lore Though a similar reference can be found in Yeat's Celtic Twilight, I found thisreference in an old Irish Fairytale called the Potato Supper. “Some folk saythat the Little People, the Fairies, were once angels that were cast out ofHeaven for their sins”. In the same work there is also a reference to theshining path to Elphame. In a small children's book by Robin May called Hallowe'en, there are tworeferences of particular interest. The first states that it was once believedthat however unlucky the Fairies could be in human affairs, it was even moredisastrous if the land lost its Fairies altogether. I feel sure that this is a folk memory which harkens back to the time when thefertility of the land relied upon the presence of the Fairy Queen or King andtheir contact with the wisdom of the Otherworld. Its Sovereignty meant that heror his management of the land, and her or his guidance of the people in itsproper husbanding, was essential for the survival of the nation. This wasdespite the occasional costs which, in any event, have been largely exaggeratedand added to later stories of predation under adverse circumstances. The Apple Trees of AvalonThe second reference reiterates previous notes, from another angle on the Applesymbolism. May states that apples were once thought to be a link between men andthe gods. What this obviously means is that they facilitated a link between thetwo, which means that apples had some psychotropic effect. Naturally they donot, if they are ordinary apples. In Cornwall, Hallowe'en or Sanihain is called Allan Day and the apples involvedin the holiday ritual there are called Allan Apples. To eat them brings goodluck, apparently, which is a watered-down version of the idea that when one atean Allan Apple, one would see the gods. Allan is an abbreviated form of Avalonand so the lucky apples—the ones that forge the ethereal link and facilitatetranscendence—are the Apples of Avalon. Avalon, the Isle of Apples, is the Isle of the Swan Maidens, the priestesseswho, like Lilith, are the Apple Trees themselves, whose endocrinal fruit bringswisdom and vision. The foregoing reinforces the assertion that Druidism isTantric as well as dualistic and that Druids were men “Of the (Apple) Tree”. Zen and the Wild HuntSeveral games which are associated with both Hallowe'en and apples areparticularly interesting. They have ancient roots in ceremonial Druidic andWitch pageants which had a teaching role to play within the Samhain festivals. The first, Apple Ducking, where one attempts to catch apples, floating on water,with one’s teeth, links two Fairy symbols—the apple of Avalon and the mere orlake in which the Fairy isle is situated. The apples bobbing in the waterrepresent Avalon itself. To gain wisdom from the fruit of Avalon, one must firstbe immersed in the water and thereby enter Elphame in order to win the covetedprize. The second game involved eating an apple whilst balancing, legs astride, on aseesaw, in the middle of which, between one’s legs, there was placed a lightedcandle. The trick was to make both ends of the seesaw balance at the same heightfrom the ground. The meaning of this is discovered firstly in the pentagram ofthe Goat of Mendes where the candle, stuck between its horns, representsillumination from the womb of the goddess. Secondly, this illuminating wisdom, facilitated by the reinforcing symbol of theparticipant eating the apple and thus obtaining the enlightening fluids of thewomb, sustains balance within the individual, represented by the balance of theseesaw. In perfect balance, positive and negative forces cancel each other outand produce an equilibrium, which is both everything, and nothing, stillness,the Nix or Zero. The seesaw, like the Zero, is another principal symbol in ZenBuddhism. Enlightenment exists in balance and the candle, at the pivotal point,also suggests this teaching. The third game involves taking an Allan Apple to bed on the night of Hallowe'en.One places it under one's pillow in order to dream of an event or of someknowledge one wishes to be appraised of. The apple is a symbol of theOtherworld. The act of taking it to bed and placing it under the pillow is asubstitute for the ancient practice of sleeping in the tomb chamber or later, ofsleeping in a graveyard overnight in order to obtain knowledge from theancestors. It is interesting to note the amount of lovers’ games that are attached toSainhain, a time when all hell was supposed to break loose. Previously I saidthat Odin was often called upon out of context as a god of love. It appears thatthe Starfire hypothesis is correct because two Hallowe'en divinatory games inparticular relate the symbols of transcendent wisdom to the cause of love. In the first game, which is played at night by either sex, the performer eats anapple and brushes his or her hair whilst looking in a mirror. The image which,it is said, appears in the glass is supposed to be that of one's future lover orspouse. Firstly, the apple represents Fairy wisdom obtained by eating the fruitof the glands. Secondly, mirrors, like meres or lakes are doorways to Elphame,the land which is the reversed, mirror image of this world. Thirdly, the comb orbrush is a symbol of the mermaid and royalty. The code translates as an invocation. By brushing the hair one mimics, andthereby invokes within one’s self, the godform of the mermaid or merman, theFairy inhabitant of the mirror world of the sacred lake within which lies theIsle of Avalon, the Otherworld. This corrupted act identifies one with the Dragon Blood. The act of eating anapple shows the ritual intention of knowing, by looking into the Otherworldbehind the mirror, the identity of who will either eat of one's fruit or give oftheir fruit in a Starfire ritual—not out of mortal love, but of transcendenthierogamy. The person one sees in the mirror is the person with whom one will beunited in the Love that is Death. Alternatively, the ritual can serve as a spellto draw that person near. This is achieved by sending a message through themirror and through the subtle energy of the matrix underlying all form, which isElphame. By invoking the person in the mirror, one implies that the persondesired will not be human, which would be no good, but of Fairy or Dragon Bloodthemselves. The act of staring into the mirror is a method whereby the conscious mind can bepersuaded to concentrate whilst the subconscious mind projects the image of theprospective alchemical lover into the glass. As such it mixes sympathetic magic,which is basic Hermetics, with scrying. Pools of ink, black mirrors, the stillsurface of lakes or ponds have all been used for this type of scrying, which isin itself a form of hypnosis intended to bypass the conscious mind. Thisindicates that the doorway to the Otherworld is, in fact, the subconscious minditself. Plenty of archaic symbolism speaks to that effect, including the tenetsof Dualism on the personal or microcosmic level. Hazel and HearthfireIn previous notes I have covered the symbolism of the hazelnut in some depth. Inrelation to Hallowe'en, a game exists wherein an individual, wishing to knowwhether they will unite with another successfully or not, throws two hazelnutsinto the hearth. If they burn to ashes, the marriage or affair will be thoughtof as doomed to die. No esoteric overtones need apply here. The symbol of the hazelnut comes from the tale of the Well of Nechtan, and itsSalmon of Knowledge, and the symbol itself is corrupted. Perhaps somesympathetic magical component survives, but it serves nothing to belabour thepoint. It is interesting to note, however, that another fruit associated with theRosicrucis and the act of Starfire has been linked to mortal love. This furtherconfirms that originally in the hierogamical act there was parasexual physicalcontact, an act “of love”, as an intrinsic part of the alchemical process, ofwhich this game is but a dim folk memory. Although these games were once an intrinsic part of Hallowe'en, especially inthe last century, they started out as Druidical and Witchcraft practices.Consequently in their purer, older form, they are part of Fairy tradition asmagical rituals conducted long ago by the Fairies themselves. Traditionally, Hallowe'en is the time when the gates of hell or the Otherworldare thrown open and the Fairies, Witches and ghosts walk the earth creatingmayhem. However, this tale arose because Hallowe'en was the beginning of thelean time of winter and to the Fairies, whose ancient Scythian ancestors weretraditionally used to raiding, it was the time to stock up for the cold monthsahead. This is the basis for the identification of Samhain as Mischief Night, which hasbeen carried forward to the present day by both the Guisers and the Trick orTreaters. In their respective times, they have dressed up as demons, Witches andsprites to knock on people's doors and demand food or gifts. The Fairy wouldhave taken this night as one of the last shopping opportunities before the snowsset in, and would have created havoc by raiding the surrounding countryside forfood and goods. This, then, was the time of the Wild Hunt for consumer durables and comestibles,as well as for Elf women, whose serum levels at that dark time of year, wouldhave been naturally high. It will be remembered that from the Dark Ages onwards,much of their lands had been cleared and therefore, they were a dwindling,persecuted and beleaguered people who found it increasingly difficult to supportthemselves on fewer and fewer resources. It is no wonder then that stories have come down to us today of the times whenthe very demons of hell would visit torment on a terrified mankind. It seems ajust, inevitable and unavoidable retribution for man's treachery and betrayal ofan ancient, beautiful and mystical people. Without them, man has lost his wisdomand sense of balance, and has raped the Earth to his own doom. The Sword of DurandelThe sword of Roland de Vere, who was born around 809 AD, was called Durandel. Anearlier spelling of this curious name, from the Oxford Dictionary of EnglishLiterature, is Durindana. The word Dwarf appears in Old Norse as “dvergr” (Dva-Righ), with no apparentetymology. The closest word to it in English is Dwale, which, in Danish is spelt“dvale”—a soporific drink made from deadly nightshade or belladonna, aningredient of the Witches’ flying ointment. Tolkien took names for his dwarves from the Icelandic Prose Edda. These namesincluded Dwalin or Dvale, the shamanic flying potion, and Durin, who was creatorof the nordic Dwarves. Durin is perhaps Dva-Rign, implying Death's King or theKing of the Otherworld, which seems appropriate in relation to the Scythian cultof Nergal, etc. Dwar appears in Transylvania as the god Thor of the (smith's)hammer. Dwalin was the Elf-Smith who forged the head of Odin's spear, Gungnir,perhaps with meteor iron. The word Dwarf has nothing to do with midgets. Like the Troll—whose name simplymeans migrant wanderer—the Dwarf has become an underground-dwelling spirit ofdiminutive proportions, when once they were probably, like the trolls, of“giants” size. We must appreciate such a term in the same way as we would thinkof Titans as being gigantic or “great” men of renown. The dwarves represent anearly class of Danish god. The Dwarfs were miners and smiths and, as such, are identical to the cyclopses,Titans and kobolds. Therefore, they are human-sized Elven alchemist-smiths.Their habit of drinking dwale to contact the Otherworld gave them the nameDwarfs. In every respect they are of normal height or perhaps taller, and thesame as Robin Hood, Robin Artisson, the Sprite, the Pict-Sidhe, the Red Cap, theBoggart, the Troll and so on. They are the “sons of stone” and the children ofAnu. They are the Elf Lords of the Scythians. The “Dwarf” is just another branchor “ritual characteristic” of the Scythian Tuadhe. In relation to the Danes, theDwarfs were like the Fir Bolg of Scandinavia, representing an earlier wave ofDanaan migration. Durin d'Ana is probably the original spelling of the name of Roland's sword,meaning perhaps Elf-Father of Anu. The alternative spelling, Durandel, likewisecould mean: Durin Dail (Lord Durin)—Lord-father of the Elves. This, during the European “Ageof Heroism” seems an entirely appropriate name for the sword of an Elven Princeand a Brudhe-Bard of the Druids, who was a son of Melusine. (Michael Hunter) This confirms him, as it says in the Vere charts, as the weapon's “custodian”,as it is likely to have been passed down to him as the sword of a hero. This issimilar to the sword Gram, which was given by Regin to Sigurd, who killedRegin's brother, the Dragon Lord Fafnir. Hence we have Roland as “Keeper of theSword of the Durin Dail”, the Durin d'Anu or Elf Father. As the sword of the Elf Father, this reinforces the Durandel's heroicidentification with Gram, the weapon Odin thrust into the Oak Bransock.Charlemagne, Roland's uncle, had a sword named Joyeuse which was forged by thepagan god Waylandor Volundthe Smith. It is not unreasonable to assert thatRoland's sword was probably forged by his ancestral forebear, the alchemist andDruid, Kai ap Emrys. Therefore Durandel was made by a type of Andvari, the ElfKing who lived in the original Scandinavian “Mirkwood” who was the final keeperof Andvarinaut, the Draupnir Ring of Midgard (or Tolkein's “Middle Earth”),which he kept hidden in a pool adjacent to that forest. Roland appears in Lordof the Rings as Boromir, whose sword and horn are smashed at the last standagainst the Orcs on Amon Hen, Boromir's Roncevalles. In defence of Charlemagne, he is, as David Day points out, a supposedlyChristian king with a Pagan Ring and Magical Sword. His capital is founded onthe Mere in which, like the Andvarinaut, that ring rests at the centre of hiskingdom. Like so many other kings during the Christian period, Charlemagne'sthrone is positioned under the Damoclesian sword of the Catholic Church. If one reads his letter to Pope Leo III, written in 796, one can see, as thecommentary suggests, that Charlemagne was no fool. He appears to haveanticipated the continued rise of the Church and its desire to interfere withand ultimately control the secular world. It is very possible that in thisrespect, he was aware that the Church had sponsored the counterfeiting, in hiskingdom, of the Donation of Constantine. His response was to assert that it wasthe king's job to defend the Church from pagan hordes (by which he really meantprotect his kingdom), whilst it was the Pope's job to pray for the success ofthe king. In a sense, in his words, he reduces the rank of the Pope to that of aglorified “canting cleric”. The letter goes on to engineer a psychological scenario in which the Popeaccepts Charlemagne's authority and control over the Church, rather than that ofthe Church over Charlemagne. He asserts that he never agreed to be emperor andwould have avoided the Basilica of St. Peter's that day if he had known that thePope had intended to exceed his authority by crowning Charlemagne. His genteeldiplomacy was necessarily addressed to an institution that had sponsored themurder of Charlemagne's ancestor Clovis. (Ehler and Morral, Church and Statethrough the Centuries, p.12) Roland's descendant, Alberich I, is supposedly named after the Dwarf of theGerman hero cycles. However, a curious passage appears in David Day's Tolkein'sRing: “In many German Hero Cycles, the most persistent character in the ring questtradition is the guardian of the ring and the treasure. This is the Dwarf knownas Andvari in the Norse tales and Alberich in the German legends. Althoughcapable of being tamed, he is usually a sinister figure; however in lateromances his appearance and powers often change. He often lends help to otherheroes under alternative names: Alferich, Laurin and Elbeghast. Increasinglythis character supplied all the supernatural elements in German romance: Dwarf;wizard, Elf, smith, guardian and god. By the sixteenth and seventeenthcenturies, he is entirely transformed. In Britain he becomes Auberon, and byShakespeare's time he is the remarkable Oberon, the King of the Fairies. In thisrole in A Midsummer Night's Dream, he is said to be the radiant god of love, andthe Immortal son of Julius Caesar and Morgan La Fay”. All herein, concerning midget miners and the like, supports the evidence thatDwarfs, Elves, Fairies, Pixies, Witches, Dragons, Vampires, Druidhes, magi,gods, Gnomes, Sprites, pucks, pouccas are all the same species. They have beenvariously caught or observed, at different times and in different places, in thecommissioning of one or other weird or nauseous act after which they are thennamed, and for which they then become remembered for all time!a) Andvari is Andurin or Durin.b) Alferich is Elf King.c) Laurin is C12H2402, a crystalline substance obtained from the berries of thebay tree or laurus nobilis. Compounds derived from it include lauric aldehyde,ether and chloroform. The bay tree, the elder and the yew comprise the sacredgrove of sleep in Ogham. Laurin, like Dwale and Dwarf is a name that derivesfrom yet another way that the Pixies got intoxicated. Laurin is also “thetunnel” or labyrinth.In Tolkien's world, Lorien was a Lord or Vala (see previously mentioned book)called Irmo and Lothlorien. In The Lord of the Rings there was the garden ofLorien, or the land of Elphame. Tolkien's description of Lothlorien is identicalto numerous descriptions of the state of being variously named Union withGodhead, Samadhi and the Kingdom of Heaven.The reader is strongly advised to read Cohen and Phipps' The Common Experience(Rider and Co. London) in relation to this concept. Lothlorien is a place, as isElphame, that can only be seen in a special state of being. The whole universeis Lothlorien or Drakenberg* —the Kingdom of the Elves—one just has to see itfor what it is. Lothlorien translates into English as the Loth or Lot of Laurin,“The Sorrow of Laurin”. Laurin is the Kingdom of the Elves, the Labyrinth: theGateway to Heaven, Atman or Kether. The Sorrow of Laurin is the sorrow of aplace departed from. The whole world is becoming grey as the living death ofconsumerism takes hold across the planet. The wolves really are at the bordersand soon Laurin will be gone forever. Hidden under a gigantic pile of discardedMacdonald's cartons, Coke cans and reams of printer paper from former trees,covered in corporate consumer nonsense. *Drakenberg is the legally recognised name of the Nation State of the DragonPeoples. Drakenberg was officially recognised in 1997 by one Western Government.The Dragons wanted to see whether they could get their old enemies to recognisethe Kingdom of the Elves, they having spent 1000 years attempting to eradicateall trace of it from the public consciousness. The exercise was successful andDrakenberg—the Dragon Sovereignty (Lothlorien, if you like)—exists with all thepowers of an incorporeal state of peoples as defined by the United Nations.Essentially therefore, being an Elf or a Dragon is a recognised nationality!This was a serious political move undertaken for serious environmental andsocial reasons. Richard Dufton has contributed some research he did on the subject of the HolyMountain. Before the Black Sea flood, the water level was obviously a lot lowerthan it is now. Richard Dufton has maintained, having studied the soundings,that in the centre of the Black Sea there was an elevated piece of land. This,he asserts, must be the original home of the Ogdoad, the eight gods of the Ubaidwho attempted to restore this little bit of high heaven on earth after thedeluge, but failed and scattered with their tribes to the four winds. InTolkein’s Akkabaleth, the sundering of the Elves follows a major flood and intheir wanderings across the Earth they take with them the biblical deluge storyand the memory of their sacred mountain home. This first post diluvial migrationmarked the beginning of the Elven calendar, which counts the days after theflood that removed them from their Sacred Home. In 2004 the date stands at 7068. Additionally it is also of interest to note that the “Bay of Belfalas” inTolkien's “Middle Earth” appears to have an identical contour to a bay on theeastern shore of the Caspian Sea. Essentially this region is “Middle Earth” ingeographical terms we would understand. Whilst I would not for one moment useTolkien's work as an “academic source”, it is worth pointing out again thatTolkien borrowed a lot from myth and history. Although he denied an allegoricalcomponent in his work, it does nevertheless plot the fortunes of the Elvenfamilies, simply because of the material he used. In some works, I believe, hisThird Age was said to correspond with the period of earth's historycorresponding to roughly 10,000 BC. It is usual to think of this time as being highly primitive and entirelydissimilar to anything Tolkien described in The Lord of the Rings. However, weshould take a fresh look at our own history and disregard the old schoolindoctrination we received that discounted anything as being historicallysignificant or culturally evolved before the time of the Greeks and Romans. Wewill then discover that the new archaeological evidence would point to therebeing a fantastic level of social, cultural, spiritual and industrialcivilisation in Eurasian history as far back as 22,000 years BC. Richard Ridgley's recent work in dismissing the myth of primitive ancestry istruly inspiring in this respect, and gives birth in the mind's eye to a world ofincredible antiquity which, nevertheless, is far closer to ours than we couldhave ever previously envisaged. Tolkien's Third Age could have sat ascomfortably in 22,000 BC as it was said to have done in 10,000 BC. Although wecannot use Tolkien as a scholarly resource, we should remember that the humanmind has an imagination. Tolkien's work, because it is not too far off the markand uses aspects of lore that exist in human history, does stimulate the mind toimagine what things were like so long ago. This is no bad thing if objectivity is exercised, because if we dismissimagination and vision as fantasy, we dismiss a tremendous creative faculty. Theimagination unlocks doors to racial and genetic memory, and a wealth ofinformation that we might call anticipatory, inasmuch as it seems to appear outof the blue. Einstein is said to have used creative imagination to assist informulating the Theory of Relativity and without imagination and reverie, Kekulewould never have discovered the indole ring. Chemistry as we know it would neverhave existed. d) Elbeghast is white ghost or Elf Spirit, giving us Sprite, or Puck orRobin. e) Shakespeare's Oberon was Aubrey de Vere. Thus Aubrey and Alberich wereDragon Ring Lords, as was Robert the third earl, who was Robin Hood. Robin'sfather was Oberon, Oberon's father and mother were Caesar and Morgan La Fey. Inreal life Robert's father was Aubrey, who's father and grandfather were Alberic.This is how Alberich became Auberon who became Oberon, father of Robin or Puck.Alberic de Vere's ancestors included Melusine's great great grandmother; MorganLa Fey and Julius Caesar's family! Edward de Vere seems to have “been” William Shakespeare, and as such he seems tohave written A Midsummer Night's Dream as a genealogy of his family! As theancestry Edward gave for Robin, also known as Puck, also known as Pan (theWitches’ god) is accurate in the play, it seems fair to assert that Melusine wasdirectly descended from Morgana. Therefore the marriage between Morgana andJulius Caesar in A Midsummer Night's Dream is the marriage together, in reality,of the bloodlines of Morgana and Julius, both in the union of Melusine andRaymond, and in the union of Elinus and Pressina. This makes sense. Having such an accurate knowledge of his family history makesit even likelier that Edward's Stag Ride was intended to assert his dynasticdescent, just as A Midsummer Night's Dream did. The star therefore that alightedon the lance of Alberich I was indeed the falling star, Lucifer's emerald, theLia Fail, the cubic stone of the Grail. This made the Robin Hood of Englandidentical to the Robin Artisson of Ireland, as Art's Son or Mac Art, son of theLia Fail. It also confirms Robin Artisson, like Jesus, as son of the tekton orcraftsman. The legendary Alberich was a smith-tekton. Perhaps the star on thelance tip of Alberic de Vere also symbolised its forging from star iron, likeOdin's Gungnir. f) Oberon as the god of love directly corresponds with Odin as a god of love,and both connect with Herne and the parasexuality of the Wild Hunt. Oberon isAndvari in the Danish cycle, the possessor of a Ring of red gold calledAndvarinaut—“The Web of Andvari”. This ring of red-gold itself made gold, abio-alchemical allusion to wisdom through the possessing and the imbibing ofroyal blood. The Ring symbolised the “rose” of the Swan or Dragon Maiden, whilstthe web was the interwoven mass of blood vessels of her body, symbolised by thebranches of the Tree of Life. A similar symbol is the Ring as a pool nestling atthe foot of Yggdrasil, like Nechtan's Well. In this way the Dragon Ring becomes the Holy Grail, and the Cross and the Circleunite as one. Odin possessed an identical ring called Draupnir, “The Dripper ofGold”, which gave him power over the Nine Worlds, the nine spheres that are thesephiroth of Yggdrasil, making Odin, Andvari and Oberon or Alberic, Lords of TheRings. In the Volundarkvitha of Iceland, Volund, or Wayland the Smith married aValkirie who appeared to him as a Swan Maiden. To keep her, he stole her Swanguise which, after nine years, she found hidden. Making her escape, she leavesVolund a Magic Ring which, after a series of adventures, is the one that ends upin Alberich's lands. Swan MaidensIn Germany these are identified as the Nixes or Mere Maids, thus Melusine andthe Ladies of the Lake. To confirm them as the Valkiries, we have the foregoingexample. Also we have the Valkirie habit of hanging the heads of the fallennobility (not rank and file warriors) from their horses’ harnesses in very earlydepictions of them recently discovered, which appear exactly like the Morganasor Morrigans, the Swan Maidens or Ladies of the Lake. Brunhilde, Sigebert's wife, was a Valkirie. At some point in her adventures sheends up enclosed in a ring of fire by Odin. This brings us to the Phoenix. ThePhoenix is the Raven, the Morrigan of the Scythians and the national emblem ofthe Danish Vikings. This black bird became the double-headed eagle of theempire, but began in Tartaria or Transylvania as the two-headed Raven orPhoenix. The PhoenixRavens and the Corvidae (corpse-watchers) family in general like nothing morethan to sit and fumigate themselves over a smoking fire. Often, as historyattests, they will take burning brands back to the nest which inevitably burstsinto flames itself. The Raven rising from the flames gave rise to the legend ofthe Phoenix, whose sun-dappled plumage, like the Raven's, is redgold andrainbow-hued. The Raven as a badge of the Scythians became associated with Phineas Farsidheand in consequence was named after him. If we think of Phineas' clan as beingboth the root and head of the Tuadha d'Anu, as well as its most wise, then thedouble-headed Raven or Phoenix would be the senior totem of the Danaan. It makessense then, that in terms of explaining the levels of wisdom, a serpent eating aserpent became a Dragon, and a Dragon eating a Dragon became a Phoenix. The Phoenix rising from the ashes reborn as a symbol of youth and eternal lifeis related to the Morrigan's and the Danaan Chieftain's habit of sustaining youth and wisdom by drinking noble blood, like Odin(Samael-Hearne-Oberon-AIberich-Wotan) and Freja (Lilith-Venus-DianaTitania) andthe Valkiries or Morganas. Shakespeare links the Phoenix and the Turtle as doesHebrew magical literature, which links both with the serpent N'H'sh and theQlipphoth of the Kabala. In essence the Raven or Phoenix consumes the blood ofthe turtle-Dove, symbol of the Holy Spirit, Sophia, Venus-Lilith (the fallingstar or Lia Fail), Magdalene and the San Graal. The Raven as a symbol of death is counterbalanced through the Phoenix as asymbol of life. In a sense this reinforces the Life through Death philosophy ofthe Nergal cult of the Scythians. The Morganas and Valkiries are the Angels ofDeath in their black, Raven feather cloaks. In their Swan Feather cloaks,however, they become the Repha'im, the Angels of Light, the Swan Maidens andfountain Fairies whose blood gives life and wisdom. In the story of Volund, as in many others, men often win Swan Maiden wives byacts of deception and theft. The common scenario is the descent of the maidensto some private mere where they divest themselves of their Swan's skins andbathe naked, as humans, in the secret pool. The peeping tom, having fallen madlyin love and desirous of taking one of these women to wife, steals her skin whichprevents her from leaving the mortal realm. The truth behind the myth is thatthe Swan skin is in fact a ritual garment, a cloak or mantle of office uponwhich is laid a heavy geis. It is the raiment of a Bruidhina (Vruidhina or Veruidhina—a truth or lawspeaker), a Repha'im, and as significant then in social terms as would be theauthority implied within a royal staff or seal ring. The wearer would have beeninvested with all the power implicit within the Swan Cloak, as a shaman, apriest, princess or king, and a member of the Tuadhe of the supreme overlords. To lose one would indeed bind the maiden or knight to “this world” until she orhe recovered it. To have one stolen, with the possible implication that it mightbe worn by someone outside one’s own caste, would have been a reversal of allthat was understood to be governed by the natural laws of the cosmos. It wouldhave represented a reversal of the naturally ordained social structure of thetime. To have one stolen and possibly worn by a thief would be an abomination. The very essence of the identity of the Valkiries, Morganas and the Bruidhinaswas that they were Oath-Keepers and Truth-Speakers. Valkirie is related, likeValhalla, to the Goddess of Truth—Var, and to Va or Vere, the Oath, the Truthand Verte, the Green. To these Ladies of the Green, the Law of Nature was the Law of Truth, as thewords Var and Ver suggest. To have someone posing as a Swan maiden or knight, ineffect to be lying in the very act of wearing a Swan Cloak, was a loathsomeimpertinence to a race that loathed liars. It would bring a curse upon thewearer and the owner. The unfortunate princess would be bound to tarry until thecloak was recovered. To return without it would have been unthinkable and couldhave exacted extreme penalties. If we look at the role of the angels in biblical myth they are originallyderived from the Nephilim and later the Repha'im. In popular art thesebeautiful, almost asexual, angelic figures are shown with Swans’ wings. TheRepha'im, whose cult was founded in Idumaea and the region around Scythopolis,were ancient Dragon Queens and Kings who, so it was thought, had passed into theOtherworld, from whence they emerged from time to time, to aid or judge in theaffairs of mankind. In fact they were the mound-dwelling Fairy royalty whose practices includedliving in tombs and Beth Seathans or Sacred Mounds which, like all temples inclassical pagan belief, were thought to be the dwelling places of the gods.Historians state that the early believers thought that the “gods” (inhabitingcarved images) lived in the statuary. This may have been the case later on, but originally the gods were the royalpriestesses and priests themselves. Acting originally as the ambassadors of theAnunnaki, the Nephilim and later the Repha'im, they were the police of theancient world. The Swan Cloak, representing the height of the wisdom of theDragon, was the symbol of their authority. Like an angel's wings, it denotedthat they soared above the common realm of mortal understanding and concern. If we think of them as starting out in history as a kind of royal-blooded policeforce, then one might equate the loss of the Swan Cloak with the loss by amodern police officer of his or her warrant card and uniform. The social havoc apolice impersonator can wreak is considerable. The Druidic Repha'im were muchmore than modern police officers, they were judges and lawgivers as well, andhad the power of life and death over all men. Thus the loss of a shamanic cloakwas a disaster. Loosely speaking then, we can think of the Raven Cloak as the BloodHunting orWar Cloak of the Angel of Death, and the Swan Cloak as the Blood-Giving or PeaceCloak. The Swan Guise is often associated with the Fairies’ appearance as a boonor help to mankind, as in the case of Lohengrin. Similarly, the Swan Guise isoften associated with Love as well, as is the case with Caer and Oenghus andVolund. So we can consider the Swan Cloak as the mantle of the Elven Lord orlady in their role as the giver of wisdom, the giver of sacred blood and life,and the Divine Lover. LeprechaunsThe word is said to come from the old Irish luchorpan, lu=small + corp=body.However, as we know, the Irish leprechauns or Sidhe were the Danaan, and thesewere full-sized people. Old Irish would have been spoken at the time when theDanaan were still around, if only as a remnant. St. Patrick was the guardian ofa Danaan Princess and her descendants are recorded as witnessing the Battle ofClontarf. Therefore Irish people would have known that leprechauns were notsmall. The leprechauns are most commonly depicted wearing green—Robin Hood orArtisson's colour. In the case of leprechaun the lepre stands for lepra, meaningscaled, as in leprosy, rendering leprechaun as “scaly-bodied”, not small-bodied. This is explained by the fact that the Zmei or Dragon lords, the Sarmations,Cimmerians and the Dacians (who had a winged serpent or Dragon cult going backto the post-migrational Ubaidculture of Transylvania in 3000 BC), as well as thelater Danes, all wore fish-scale armour. It is also possible that as Dragon Lords they would have worn serpentine ordraconian helmet-masks, not too dissimilar to the animal-masked helmets of theRoman gladiators and the masked helmets of the Greek Warriors. This may accountfor the Ubaid pottery figurine's snake-like looks and the descriptions of theAnunnaki as having “serpentine” faces. Additionally, certain cults wore snakemasks. The Sumaire of Irelandare the serpent Vampires. The scaled skin of the serpentor Dragon is the armour of the Leprechaun who is thus the Sumaire, as is RobinArtisson and hence Robin Hood. The same may be said of the fountain Fairies whoappeared as Dragon women. It is likely that they were similar in function to theDanish shield maidens, dressed in the scale armour peculiar to their race.Contemporary descriptions from Russia have the scales made of bull's horn orbone fillets which would give the impression that it was reptilian skin, and nota suit of armour. It is possible that if the Fairy maidens didn't wear scaledarmour, they wore a ceremonial outfit constructed along similar lines, but farlighter and more functional. In such ritual regalia, they and their ancestors,both Samael and Lilith, would have looked like serpents. In the image of Samael and Lilith in Eden, there is an intimation of the laterimage of Odin and Freja in the Forest Hall of Valhalla. Where God was a physicalpresence in the Garden, Samael and Lilith were like its spirit, resting in theTree. Similarly this spiritual presence in the Forest is echoed in one of Odin'sepithets—“The wind in the trees”. (The Spirit in Valhalla) As a type of paradise, Valhalla, the hall of 390 doors (30 x 13 blood moons),represents Eden or Avalon, and in Freja of the Apples, we have a contemporaryvariation of Morgana of the Isle of Apples and a later version of Lilith of theApple Tree of Wisdom. In very early versions of Norse myth it is only the Noble Dead that end up inOdin's Forest Hall. Once there, he and Freja split this human booty 50-50. Wecould imagine the Valkiries, of which Freja seems to be a High Queen (likeMorgana), to be like Shepherdesses and Grim Reapers of the blood and souls ofmortals, and this brings us back to a theme in earlier notes. The image of the Shepherd Kings of Kish suffers from association with the fluffybunny image of gentle Jesus, meek and mild as the kind, compassionate shepherdand teacher of his flock. In not a few instances, the Dragon blood has treatedhumankind with imperious indifference as a separate species, below its own onthe food chain. I ask myself again, in the light of more recent data, whatshepherds do for a living? We know that the Shepherd Kings of Kish wereTransylvanian Dragons and thus of the Scythian Blood Royal. Consequently theywere predators and in the totem guises of werewolf and panther, they preyed onhuman beings for food. Yggdrasil is “the steed of Ygg”. Whilst a “steed” is a mode of transport, amethod of getting to the Otherworld in this case, Ygg is Odin who obtained therunes from the stone tablet that lay next to the pool at the base of the Tree.The stone tablet is the Cubic Stone, the womb, within which is the blood, withinwhich is all wisdom. The Stone is the Uterus, the Utterer of whispered secrets,the Runa. Like the Fisher King and Jesus, Odin was pierced in his side by a lance andhanged from the tree. After nine days and nights, the holy completion of theScythian mystical three and the number of the Dragon, Odin obtained the Runes orwhispered secrets, which were revealed to him by the Elves who made them. The whispered secrets are the province of Odin as the (whispering) wind in thegrove and, as the ancient letters of the Birch forests of Carpathia and Scythia,are the property of those who first carved them, the Scythians or Sidineans. Asa Forest Script, Runic is an Elven language of the Trees and a variation ofOgharn, which was discovered by Ogma or Ogg or Ygg or Odin, who is the laterinvocational priest of the Danaan God-King Ogmios, who first invented them. In the sense that Yggdrasil is the same as the apple tree on the microcosmiclevel, then Odin's partner in Valhalla—Freja (Iduna) of the apples—is bothYggdrasll and Andvarinaut. Her apples, like those of the ladies of Avalon, whoare also themselves the Apple Trees of the Sacred Orchard, are the endocrinalcentres or Chakras of her sacred body. She is then the steed of Ygg andcorresponds symbolically to Slepnir and to the role of Rhiannon in theMabinogian, and Epona as the white mare who carries the rider to the Otherworld,the grave or womb. Here is contained all wisdom and is where Odin, the breeze,whispers gently through the branches of the trees in the sacred grove. The Breeze is the biblical Sophia or Holy Spirit, signified by the Greek Pneumaor Breath of God. The branches of the Trees of Life are the blood vessels of thebodies of the Freja, the Valkries, and Morgana and the Swan Princesses. Thesymbol denotes that the spirit of sovereignty is carried in the blood of theQueens of Hell. The deified Odin, the Ogmios or spirit of wisdom then, is thespirit of absolute kingship. He is the fully realised being— the priest-king whohas mastery over the Nine Worlds, which represent also the various divisions ofexperience and energy within the individual being. The Carolingian Ring MythIn the story of Holger Dansk or Ogier the Dane and his meeting, at a vast age,with Morgan la Fey and his restoration by her, we have a variation of Ogier asOdin (Og or Ygg) and Morgana as Iduna-Freja of the Apples. Holger Dansk was oneof Roland de Vere's brother knights in the Court of Charlemagne. Holger, likeRoland, was one of the great Paladins or Counts Palatine of the Franks,celebrated in the Chansons de Geste and hailed as the greatest warrior of allthe Danes. He is still a national hero of Denmark. Ogier has obviously become a composite figure like Robin and Alberich. He couldnot have been so incredibly old when he met Morgan la Fey because Morgan wasborn 200 or so years before Ogier. She was the great great grandmother ofMaelasanu, Roland's mother, and so if Ogier had met her, it would be she whowould have been of a great age. In this case it is possible that he hasinherited the attributes of another historical figure: Waeldeg, the Odin or Odin priest-king or Royal Godthi who married the daughterof Cormac Mac Art in 300 AD. If Waeldeg the Odin or Ogg had met Morgana, adescendant relation of Cormac's, then indeed Ogg or Ogier would have been of agreat age indeed. It appears to me that Holger or Ogier was, like Waeldeg, anOdinic Goddil and the legend attributed to one Odin priest, as history has shownin other cases, can become the legend attributed to all Odinic priests. Often they become the actual God. The finer details are not important andneither are the discrepancies. The story relates that, at a great age Ogier theDane set sail on one last adventure before returning home from Jerusalem. Hetravelled to an island on which stood a castle built of lodestone. As he sailed nearer, all the iron on his ship was ripped away and the shipitself was wrecked. Making his way to shore he entered the castle, which was litby a magical light, and went to the central court. There he discovered a greatserpent guarding a tree at the centre of the court garden. Resting in the shadebeneath the tree was the most beautiful woman he had ever seen, and on her handwas a gold ring. Ogier slew the serpent and went to the woman, who was none other than Morgan laFey. She gave him the ring from her finger and he was magically restored toyouth, health, vitality and life immortal. Morgan and Ogier then sail off to theland of the immortals, which is Tir Na Nog. The island with the castle is acommon image which is repeated in the castle of Loreli on the Rhine, whosemaiden is a fatal siren who lures sailors to their doom and wrecks their shipson the rocks. This motif has numerous variations in the cycle of stories concerning Sirens andMermaids. The island itself is a form of Avalon and the garden, the Garden ofLove, is repeated in the medieval story of the maze of Melusine. At the centreof the garden or maze is the source of life and love, either a tree or fountainpool, guarded by a maiden. This story works on two levels, Inner and Outer,singularly and relatedly. The first level is psychodynamic and the second level is psychobiological. Thefirst level is identical to Beauty and the Beast and Sleeping Beauty. Morgan'scastle is the mind-brain of Ogier. It is magnetic and attracts all experience,learning, opinion, fear, hatred, attachment and prejudice, which create a hugeserpent, much like the Mithraic bull. The serpent, like the bull, is Ahriman,the serpent of darkness or human ego-consciousness. It is the unregenerateexperiencer and judge, the critical censor. The garden is the right brain and the suppressed side of consciousness. Morganis the Anima in Jungian terms; the Tree is the symbol which joins Morgana, theanima, to the second level of the allegory. She is the Tree. An Apple Tree andan Yggdrasil, the method by which Ogier or Odin gains access to Elphame. On this level, the ring symbolises the gaining of consciousness of the eternal,the new bond forged between the left and right brain and the subsequentintegration of the whole being, leading to the voyage to the perception of theeternal. On the first level, the aim of the alchemical rite is outlined and thesteps to transcendence are mapped out. Arriving at the island is answering theinner call for transcendence. Ogier's slaying of the serpent with yet another Magical Sword, which he namedCourtain, is like slaying the Mithraic Bull. It is the obviating andneutralising of the ego. Taking the ring is joining the left and right brain,and travelling to Tir Na Nog is gaining enlightenment: Zero, the One Ring thatrules them all. In the tales of Loreli and the other mermaid or siren stories, in answering thecall of the mermaids that leads to doom, one does not experience the doom ofdeath, but the doom of the ego and the rebirth of the whole being into thelight. On the second level the Tree and the Ring are aspects of Morgan herself. Intaking the ring, the Aridvarinaut, one takes from the essence of the priestesswhose vitality spreads through the branches of her tree. The ring is also thespout at the base of Melusine’s cubic stone, it also symbolises the union thatoccurs with her as hierogamy and the perception of the eternal. The ring as the Orobourus is Mazda, the serpent of life and light which, whenaccepted and symbolically worn, returns the slain serpent of darkness to lifeand to a new relationship with the serpent of light. In this sense Ogier wasAhriman, the left brain, and Morgan was Masda, the right brain and, joined inhierogamy, they become the twin serpents entwined around the tree which theyboth also become. This symbol is emphasised in the Baphomet of the Templars and Witches and in thecaduceus of the Swan’s winged disc and the serpents. It is the symbol of thesingle soul transcended and of twin souls joined in divine union, all at thesame time. In Sleeping Beauty the hero has to find his way through a thicket which is theconfused tangle of thoughts, fears, attachments and so on which hides the castlein which the maiden, or right-brain Anima sleeps. When he reaches her and kissesher, this is his acceptance of her, and this is his desire to be united with theother aspect of himself. The kiss, the acceptance, brings her and the entire castle to life. In otherwords, the suppressed element of his consciousness is reawakened and integratedinto the individual who becomes a whole being and transcends. Beauty and theBeast, Theseus and the Minotaur, and The Frog Prince are variations of thisacceptance theme which, however, can work when the characters in the stories arein fact real people enacting the roles. In this case one states that the Anima is externalised as a Grail Princess, andunion with her causes union with the internal Anima. This is a centralcharacteristic of the second level, where “Beauty” is a real person with realpsychodynamic power and real psychobiological essence. The tantric union withsuch a person does lead to transcendence and a glimpse of Tir na Nog. Bothpartners entwine in spirit to become the caduceus. By becoming one being, theynegate the dynamic within each other and become still. This stillness is the Nixor Nil point where the minds are silent and observing “what is”, not theinternal dialogue of what they think “should be”. The story of Ogier and Morgan appears to be the joining together of twoseemingly separate racial traditions, the Danish and the Danaan, which are, infact, related both by blood and by philosophy, both being in essence from theexact same Scythian root. The tremendous advantage here is that we can assessthe earlier Danaan culture and synthesise elements of it from the later variantexpressed in Danish Viking culture, thereby enriching our view of the Fairy raceas a whole. With so many Magic Rings, Swords and Fairy Maidens attached to Charlemagne'sCourt, it becomes difficult to accept the historical view of his devoutChristianity. He seemed to surround himself with and elevate people with whomthe Church was at odds, and to whom he supposedly was an avowed enemy.Increasingly I see Charlemagne's Christianity, like Constantine's before him, asbeing a political convenience and not a heartfelt belief. The Dragon MythA legend exists stating that a couple of miles from Bamburgh Castle, there oncelived a serpent which occupied a cave in a magic mountain. Beyond the cave therewas a raised stone, out of which had been carved a large bowl-like receptacle.On occasion the local people filled this bowl with cow's milk, as a voluntarygift-offering to the serpent. (Deike Rich and Ean Begg, On the Trail of Merlin,Aquarian Press, 1991) The serpent is reminiscent of the story of Melusine. The tale is significant, inlight of the fact that the legends concerning her say that she walled up herfather in a cave near there, fled to a place called Avalon, and then decampedfor France. Perhaps the serpent was a folk memory not of her, but of her fatherwho was, despite the legends, not a “mortal” but a Sidhean of Druidic RoyalBlood, of the Ver Boig House of Ulidian. The folk story of the Dragon in the Cave is universal. The scenario runs asfollows. A Dragon takes up residence in a cave near human habitations and beginsto terrorise the countryside. In order to bring an end to the killing anddestruction, the rural inhabitants appeal to the Dragon for mercy and leniency.Negotiations are undertaken between humans and the Dragon and a compromise isreached. If the villagers regularly select a virgin female as a sacrifice,offering the same at selected intervals for the Dragon's sustenance, the Dragonagrees to spare the others. The virgin is to be tied to a stake at the mouth ofthe cave and left there for the monster to collect. When he is peckish, heemerges from his cavern and eats her whole. This is the story that has come downto us. The truth behind it conveniently excludes the rest of the bargain. In exchangefor ritual food, the “Dragon”, a Scythian Priest King or Priestess Queenprobably accompanied by his or her entourage of Druids and Warriors would, inexchange for a regular supply of fresh, readily available royal virgin blood,undertake to settle permanently in the region. This Dragon Clan, the custodiansof sovereignty and fertility, wise seers and indomitable, terrifying warriors,would elect to protect their clients and organise more efficiently their socialstructures and industries in exchange for material support and Starfire. Thelegend of the hoard of gold, which the Dragon uses as a bed, is as alchemical inorigin as the tales relating to the Dragon and the virgin. Pure gold, as well as “red gold” or virgin's menstruus, was used to enhanceconsciousness. The Dragon is not a Dragon without her or his magical vision andtranscendent being. Therefore, in alchemical Dragon tradition, the symbol of theDragon sleeping on a hoard of gold signifies that the dynamic of the Dragonidentity “rests” upon the foundation of blood and gold ingestion. The Dragon isthe ultimate guardian and fons et origio of the Sacred Wisdom. Often these Dragons were sought out and especially invited to take on theoverseership of other tribes, who provided them with gold, food, provisions andvirgin menstrual blood, which was drunk to enhance the Dragons’ magicalperformance and longevity. The Virgins rarely died, except perhaps from asurfeit of what the outsider might think of as amorous attention. That Elinus, the King of Dalriafa, was given gift offerings voluntarily, perhapsby a grateful clientele, tends to suggest that the “Dragon in the Cave” storyhas been twisted from being a common social arrangement into a terrifying bogeystory. In any event we can say with certainty that Elinus wasn't a mortal, but aDragon of the Elven Blood. "},{"pageContent":"[images/00047.jpg]Chapter 33 Clerical Connivance The Scythians or Sidheans instituted Pharaonic marriage in order to prevent thedilution of the Titanic, Royal Elven Blood. As an insular group in Eire and thefar northern reaches of Britain, it is therefore highly unlikely that they wouldhave habitually married out of their race in Gille Sidhean's time, either fromchoice or by necessity. And the frequency with which it occurs in the story ofhis family is fast becoming suspiciously habitual. Therefore the stories ofmortals marrying Fairy Princesses have to be questioned, because the motives forsuggesting that such alliances took place as regularly as medieval chroniclersclaim, might not be prompted entirely by the desire to record historical orlegendary events faithfully. In the received story of Elinus or Gille Sidhean, he is the mortal, whilst hisbetrothed is the Elf. They first met at a fountain, of which his future spouse,the Fairy Princess Bruidhina or Pressina, was said to be the guardian. Theirdaughter Melusine also married a mortal who encountered her at another Fairyfountain over a thousand miles away from where her parents reigned. This is abit of an unlikely coincidence, isn't it? Two elements emerge from this story. a) The Fairy females both married mortals. b) The mortals just happened to chance upon the Fairies at magical, andtherefore one would assume secret, fountains. The Church hated Fairies because they carried the only true, royal Dragon bloodand thus the sovereign rights to kingship that, earlier in history, these pettypeddlers coveted so much. However, in the subsequent position of power that theChurch held in the medieval period, they could direct mythmongers to writeexactly the sort of “history” that served the Church's purposes best, on pain ofdeath. Conversely, those who voluntarily took up the Church's cause were oftenrewarded handsomely for their complicity. This happened regardless of whetherthey were the chroniclers who fabricated the Church's image of sanctifiedauthority, ubiquity and omnipotence, or the churls with ecclesiasticallyenhanced, fraudulent family histories, who were raised from the bourgeoisie andpromoted as the grateful, slavish puppet kings and false nobility of the Churchstate. It is interesting to note that despite the fact that the Church has condemnedoutright the Dragon blood and its culture, it still recognised that only throughthat blood and culture could kingship be retained. Such a recognition is borneout by their fraudulent Donation of Constantine that we examined previously. TheChurch claimed that the Emperor Constantine had given it the right to crownkings and institute governments across Eurasia. Constantine was a directdescendant of the British PenDragon Kings, themselves of Danaan origin from theScythian Dragon King Tribe. Their choice of fraudulent donor clearly indicatesthat the Church itself actually admitted that only descendants of the Dragonculture were rightfully permitted to exercise such powers and bestow suchdignities. In the case of Elinus in the first principal; a) above—as the only true royal blood is Elven, the Pressina-Melusine story wasdoctored to make the two male partners mortal and therefore, quite frankly,commoners. In the first instance, this would make Melusine appear to be only half Fairyand, as the Church thought, only half royal in the eyes of the people. That theElven blood was of Titan origin and the Titans bore Mere Maids such as Melusineas full blooded Titans, instead of half Fairy, half mortal, has escaped themodern commentators who have used literary sources doctored by the Roman Church.The symbol of the woman with a human torso and the tail of a fish or Dragon haslately been assumed by writers to mean that the figure has human attributes. Theearliest myths would contradict such a view. The Church deliberately propagated these myths and consciously intended to leadaudiences to these conclusions. They put forward that this falsely attributedhuman element to the Fairy nature of the Mermaids meant that, as theseindividuals had human blood, and thus the blood of Eve in their veins, they wereno better than anyone else. Therefore they were culpable for original sin,capable of mortal sin and thus consigned to damnation, unless administered asalvation that could only be sanctioned by, or more importantly derived fromobedience to, the Holy Mother Church, just like anyone else. If this failed, they could always turn the people against their rightful Dragonqueens and kings by claiming that they were half-human monsters, beyond theChristian pale and thus evil emissaries of Satan, to be feared and vilified. Bydegrees and in turns, the Church has used all these tactics. On the point ofOriginal Sin, this was Eve's disobedience to “God”. As the Elven blood wasdescended from Lilith, who was not “guilty” of Original Sin, all Dragons andFairies and their descendants to this day were and are sinless and had and haveno need for salvation. This has been something of an irritant to the piousPopes. In the second instance Melusine, Bruithina the Younger or Bruithina Maelasanu,is questionably recorded as marrying, like her mother, yet anothermortal—rendering the royal blood that subsequently flows through herdescendants' veins appear to be of no significance at all. Such diluted bloodwould thus present no threat. Otherwise it might have derailed the Church'smaterially motivated financial ambitions. It would act as an inspiration to adowntrodden populace by contrasting its preternatural wisdom and ethos ofservice against the miserable example of the Church's intellectual paucity,spiritual vacuity and insatiable greed. Such a propagandist tactic has been used by the Church in numerous instances.Beyond this they took practical steps to annihilate these, their sovereignrivals and spiritual enemies, by falsely claiming jurisdiction over the choiceof so-called “noble” and “Royal” marriage partners, insisting that suchmarriages be sanctioned and licensed by the Pope. In this way they couldpressurise the true nobility into marrying the Church's burgeoning bourgeoisieand encourage these bourgeois, lately elevated puppets, to marry each other. Inthis way they attempted to breed the Dragon blood out of Europe, replacing itwith a parvenu class of false, tradesman nobility, selecting their sycophantsfrom within the ranks of the tinkers and merchants. Any Dragon or Grail familiesthey couldn't intimidate, pay off or breed out, they either murdered,discredited, genealogically disinherited, ridiculed or wiped out of the historybooks altogether. In the case of the second principle in; b) above, the women, Pressina and Melusine, were in fact the fountainsthemselves, as evidenced by the medieval depiction of Melusine's fountainissuing from a Cubic Stone. In any event two identical chance meetings, separated by time and geography, butoccurring in exactly the same circumstances are not likely. We are led thereforeto the conclusion that the fountain scenario is quite probably an Elven, Royal“courtship” ritual. As these women were themselves the fountains, like Sheba inthe Song of Solomon, we are led to the further conclusion that the courtshipritual was bound up within the Starfire cycle. This was a magical Fairy rite sosecret that no human would have been permitted to attend anyway, making the ideathat either man was “mortal” untenable. Throughout history and in any of itsforms, Starfire was reserved for Queens and Kings alone, and the only trueQueens and Kings are those of the Fairy, Dragon blood. To have met the women “at the fountain” was to have engaged in the most intimateand profound magical intercourse with them, forbidden to those outside the holyrace. The reference to the fountains indicates that both the couples wereinvolved in a special form of alchemical relationship which was common beforemarriage amongst the Dragon royalty. Therefore, they all knew each otherintimately prior to wedding. It could have started when, as girls, both Pressinaand her daughter in their turns were serving as “fountains” or Grail Maidens,and lasted until the time when they were physiologically in their marriageableprime, as Dragon Queens, capable of bearing children without too manycomplications. Considering these points and the fact that Gille Sidhean, Pressina's husband,and Raymond, Melusine's husband, and also both the women themselves, all hadcomparable Vere descent, it is quite clear that the men were related to theirspouses, by blood, race or name. In the case of Gille Sidhean as stated, hisdescent was from King Erc of the 4th-century Ulidian house of the Ver Bolg ofUlster and Strathclyde, Druids whose tribal badge was the Blue Boar. Likewise, Raymond de Verrieres, or Ver-en-Forez, Lord of Pictavia and Anjou,also had the Druidic Blue Boar as his family badge. Furthermore, Pictavia wasfounded by Melusine's maternal forefathers, the Ver Kings of the Danaan remnant.Therefore the assertion as fact that the House of Vere, the First Royal House ofAnjou, was of the pure Elven, Royal Dragon Blood appears inescapable. This wasmuch to the annoyance of the Church and its chroniclers. They appear to haveattempted to eclipse the pure origins and thus the genuine sovereign status ofthe Royal House of Vere by various means, as they did with many other RoyalDragon families of the Sang Real and the San Graal. For the Dragon and theGrail, for the Vere it is of some considerable importance that we maintain ourRoyal status and assert our Elven, Dragon origins. Otherwise, to allow the Church or the Church-backed establishment,retrospectively or contemporarily, to continue to suppress or marginalise oursingular royal heritage or to ridicule our ancient magical legacy, is toconspire in the victory of all their lies. It would declare as acceptable thelast thousand seven hundred years of hypocrisy, greed and terrorism andsanction, by our silence, the inhuman oppression of generations of defenceless,disenfranchised human beings. In so doing, we share their ecclesiastical guiltand capitulate to their murderous, immoral, megalomaniacal ambition, perhaps foreven more years to come; accepting the defeat of truth, wisdom, kindness, socialequity and personal responsibility. The Dragons have asserted and had popularly accepted the historical sovereignDragon identity, its rights and its magical, Elven, genealogical legacy. In thisway they have provided another small nail in the establishment's coffin, onemore small example of how the Church-state and the establishment have committedfraud, even genocide, to protect their historical interests. The authoritieshave twisted or concealed the truth concerning many issues for centuries, inorder to control information. By this strategy, to this day, they still continueto exercise significant subconscious control over the minds of the public, overa population which formerly they have oppressed for centuries, a people overwhom they have no sovereign authority and no divine sanction or innate, moralright to rule. "},{"pageContent":"[images/00018.jpg]Chapter 34 Dreamcast The Scythian-Goidelic roots Bri, Bre and Bru are found in connection with theconcepts of dreams, judgement, poetry and spellcraft. 1) I suggest there is a link to the Welsh word Bre-uddwyd, related to theprocess of dreaming as in Breuddwyd Rhonabwy. In wyd we have the root wid,which, like wit in Saxon, means “to know”, and Breudd or Bridhe means dream.Breuddwyd might translate out as “the dream of”, but it doesn't actually meanthat. The strict interpretation of Breuddwyd is “Dream to Know” meaning; a) to discover knowledge through dreams and; b) to interpret that knowledge through seership. Both these functions are within the remit of the Bruidhe, the Druid-King whojudges the signs and who interprets the secret Law, Brehon or Logos of theCosmos, which invariably manifests itself through dreams. These are the symbolic language of the intuitive faculties of the so-calledright brain. Uncluttered by the paranoid obsession with materialistic logic andthe need to rationalise everything according to an arbitrary set of receivedprincipals, it is itself in open congress with the cosmic mind, which“remembers” the future as well as the past. The right brain is not so governedby sequential, rational linear thought. As this is what creates time, being freeof it to a much greater degree, the right brain is itself free of thechronological definitions of past, present and future and the strictures uponseership that these contrived notions impose. Underneath time is the desire fororder, under which is the desire for predictability, under which is the desirefor security, under which is the desire to be free of the absolute andever-present grip of the fear of the unknown and discontinuity. The observation of the passage of thoughts, running one behind the other in asequential linear pattern, is a conditioned reflex that creates time. In thismanner, time is simply the regulated passage of thought or memories andassumptions which have been related to units of measurement conceived of byminds that think in this linear fashion. Without linear thought there would beno linear time. However we are taught to respond to our environment in asequential fashion. As we develop as children, these responses get hard-wiredinto the neuronal pathways in the brain to become fixed and habitual.Psychobiologically the brain is trained to think in terms of past, present andfuture and actually produces chemical signals at regular intervals in order tomaintain the illusion. Some time ago scientists believed that one of the principal chemicals involvedin this process was serotonin. It was thought that it acted like a jailer,opening and closing neural circuit doorways or pathways in order to regulate thestimuli entering the brain through the senses, thereby creating a form ofsequential order. In any event the learning process is bipartite and involvesboth socio-psychological, as well as chemical stimulus. One could argue that asthe hardwiring process continues, the brain itself learns to release hormonessequentially in response to the demands of the social environment. Whether ornot this is the case, both the notion of time and the subsequent inability toperceive the present-future are subjective rather than objective phenomena. By using various means, the Bruidhe could rewire her or his brain to make itreceptive to impressions usually edited by a normal mind. Anyone who haschildren will have noticed that teaching one about the concept of chronologicaltime is generally quite a difficult task. Children of a certain age have noconcept of time at all. This is sufficient evidence upon which to argue thattime is not a natural, intrinsic law of the universe, but an acquired responseto outside demands. Jesus himself taught that one could enter the “kingdom ofheaven” whilst still here on earth. This kingdom is eternity and it lies beyonddeath in life, i.e. the cessation of thought. The ego is thought and thought is time, so once the ego is nailed to the cross,time stops and eternity begins. It's as simple as that. Unless ye become aslittle children ye shall not enter the kingdom of heaven. Similarly, the realmof Elphame is described as a “place” where seven years can be seven minutes, andseven minutes can be seven years; a place of infinite beauty and delight thatdescribes Jesus' kingdom of heaven (transcendent consciousness) with greatersuccinctness than the Bible ever does. The Uni-Verse, the One Perfect Phrase, has already been uttered—it is spherical,complete and here now. It is not unfolding or progressing anywhere. It is notachieving anything. It is just all at once. Everything it is or can be ishappening, all at once, now. We don't see its completeness because we think ofourselves as being incomplete and having constantly to achieve, which in realitywe don't. This is just an external pressure put upon us by those who wish us to continueto produce and consume, and from childhood this is how we learn to see theuniverse. We learn fear from a brutal society and develop our defence strategiesaccordingly and in subordination to wills stronger than our own. We sequenceevents according to our desire for our own form of secure order and familiarity.In so doing we block out everything we don't have words for in order to preventourselves from curling up into a tight ball in a dark room and screaming interror. In response to this conditioning, when we are asleep and relatively relaxed, themind has the ability to perceive in other ways. In order to compensate for ourtorturing it into perceiving life solely in a manner which is contrary both toits nature and the way in which the universe is formed and manifests itselfnaturally, it can produce what we think of as prophetic dreams. These are memories of a different kind of perception whose language isdifferent, because the observational skills that the mind utilises in sleep areat variance with those we normally use to create the illusion of a wakingreality governed by time and necessity. Such dreams are not prophetic at all.However, they are simply the result of the off-duty mind perceiving itsenvironment in a calmer, more complete and singular manner. 2) Bre-hon; from whence is derived “The Brehon Laws” from old IrishBrithemain—AJudge. The Brehons were an old Druidic order which existed in the pre-Christianperiod. Another related word is Bretha, which means Law and suggests Brude asBruidhe, Bruidhainn or Bruidhne (Cruithne) and Bruidhina, as law makers and lawgivers, Druidic judges and keepers of the Veritas or Oath—Truth. In the name Vere there are many varying definitions. This does not necessarilymean that only one is correct. The Druids had a deep love of language which theyconsidered sacred, reminiscent of the vibrations or “words” of power thatcreated and sustained life. According to Dr. Anne Ross they delighted in thedouble entendre and the word Vere is particularly interesting in thisconnection, as it has at least six related meanings which fall naturally withinthe class of definitions related to magic, kingship and Druidism. c) Brichtu is an Irish word for the chanted spell or rhyme. On the Chamalierestablet found in Puy de Dome near the Loire, Brichtu appears as Bricti in a sixtyword written spell or curse. This particular practice was often the remit of the bards whose praise poetrywas the upside of the satire curse. Relating Bri: versical power words, withBre; words of Law, gives us the origin of poetic justice, where the judge poetdelivers the law and the sentence against law breakers in rhyming verse withsuch power as to be able to kill the listener. Here we have the origin of theSong of the Siren or Mermaid, and the Mantra of Hinduism. The essential element of such judgement magic was that the words constructingthe poem or spell, as we call it, would, like the word Vere, be able tosuccinctly, eloquently and completely encapsulate and encircle the intention ofthe Druid or Druidess. This would be suggested within the meaning of words.These would be formed within a carol or round which, like the mantra, is acyclic or circular-structured chant, the shape of which suggests irrevocablecompleteness. Better still, the rare poetical chant is structured in 3D, like asphere—the most succinct and eloquent shape in existence. The first and lastbuilding block of such a mental power structure is the Och or “YES”, theaffirmative expression of absolute Truth and Will: the Ver. The key to creating such an all-encapsulating vessel for the conducting of poweris to ensure that the words used make the intention absolutely and perfectlysuccinct without waste or unnecessary embellishment. Examples of this level of truth and the psychological power it has to strip awayself deceit still exist today. The bardic practice of creating satire chantsthat could kill is based on judgement as assessment of the character, and theability to strike right at the heart of delusion and pretence. Satire isprobably not the word academics should use here because it doesn't convey theweight of such an ability. Having smashed through the protective barriers of the persona, the bard couldthen implant a seed message within the victim's subconscious that wouldautosuggestively produce any required effect. Hence the tales that the bardscould maim or destroy with their words. The chant was delivered by the bard inthe posture of the Crane. He would stand on one leg, with the foot of the otherresting on his knee to form an upside down 4, similar to the posture of theHanged Man of the Waite Tarot. With one arm outstretched and one eye closed hewould deliver his curse. This ritual posture was called Corrguinecht, referringto the Crane or “Crane-Wounding”. It is exactly the same posture once used byAustralian aboriginal shamans for “pointing the bone” or “singing the death”. Inshort, this is sophisticated hypnosis, using similar but more sophisticatedresonant pitches that seem to pass beyond the inner ear and sound within theinside of the skull of the recipient. Certain metal healing spheres, which havebecome popular in the last ten or so years, if skilfully constructed, can appearto emit their chime—not from the ball itself but from inside the head of thelistener. This makes it appear as if the mind is the source of origin of thesounds. Hence the Song of the Sirens. Consequently Sirens, Harpies or Mermaids could lure men to their deaths andmantras could create miracles. The added dimension of resonance is alsopertinent here when willing the occurrence of desired events. The spell or chantconstructed in the same way as the judgement poem impresses itself here, not onthe mind of the listener, but on the subconscious of the singer, and suggests aninevitability to the event or phenomena desired. In a sense, the repetitivecyclic or spherical nature of the spell acts as a garter or womb in which theintention is held and sustained. The repetitive, cyclical rhyming nature of thechant impresses itself on the mind and continues to express the will of thesinger without the singer having to be conscious of the act of spelling. At thesame time, the resonant pitch chosen is selected to match the frequency level ofthe objective article. Added to this is the concept of will and visualisation. It is possible to influence humans or human related events by pitching theresonance at theta, which is below the conscious delta wavelength, and use thisas a carrier wave within which is mixed the visualised desire of thepractitioner. This is not magic. This is quantum physics. The dynamic of thewill aspect of it has been verified by the Princeton University EngineeringDepartment and other reputable institutes researching dream telepathy and remoteautosuggestion. The entire process involves subtle levels of energy andfrequency. All so-called magic using subconscious sustaining devices, even the“Witches’ Bottles”, is based on this principle. In the construction of the verse element, within which is retained and conveyedthe intent, the spellcaster must bring to the surface such accuracy and truththat no artifice could stand against it. The chant must be constructed in such away as to express and encapsulate that essence of conceptual and wilful beauty,balance and order that the Greeks called Xocmoc, the complete sphere. Theconcept enjoys the validity of being an absolute truth and hence a reality. Itdraws wilful energy from the mind and becomes sustained there as an absoluteconviction, or, as Jung would describe it, a semi-autonomous complex. In themind of the victim it becomes the desired destructive obsession, whilst in themind of the spellcaster seeking a result elsewhere, it becomes asub-routine—geared to making what is external conform to the pattern of theunbending, internal will. d) Bruidhne, Bruidhe (King Brude), Bruidhina (Pressina). The Bru or Bri elementin these names confirms the Druidic origin of the Picts and of Brude and hisdaughter Pressina. Bruidhe and Bruidhina, father and daughter, can be seen asDruid and Druidess of the rank of Judges and Spellcasters whose roles, withtheir obligations and powers, were passed on to Maelasanu. As a Fee, d'AvalonMaelasanu was a Morgana or Morrigan, a descendant of the black robed Druidesseswho, according to Tacitus, cast spells against the armies of Suetonius Paulinuson Anglesey in 61 AD. We can say with confidence that these priestesses were theBlack Ravens, the Morrigans who swept across the fields of battle despatchingthe fallen. These Morganas and Maelasanu after them were the Poetess-Judges who wielded thepower of the Sirens or Mermaids with whom Mealasanu was identified so closely.The Brude King or Druid King was the custodian of tradition, and this too musthave been one of Maelasanu's natural duties as a Druidess. It would seemappropriate to think of her not simply as Maelasanu, but as the “BruidhinaMaelasanu”, the Druid-Princess and Siren Queen. Tradition states that Maelasanuwas the niece of Morgana La Fey. It is obvious that this relationship isconfused because of the sister-wife arrangement shared between Morgana andArthur. It is also clear therefore that King Brude himself married a sister ofTortolina and that that sister was Pressina's mother. After all, Morgana herselfwas a “Bruidhina” and a Fee d'Avalon, and the similarities between her andMaelasanu are striking. As a maiden of the Grail, Maelasanu corresponds to thePage of Cups and the sign of the Swastika is attributed to her by JosephMaxwell. Writing in the last century, he confirms to be representative ofsexually derived energy. In other words, Starfire. In the French Tarot, Maxwelldescribes the Page holding a Grail from which emerges the Swastika or, as weknow it, the vortex, which either emits or draws life energy. This echoes thelayout of Maelasanu's maze garden as the Swastika and the symbol of theprocession being drawn into the vortex or Sumaire, or her energy being projectedfrom it as it exudes from her Fairy fountain. e) The role of the Druid as seer or prophet, the interpreter of the futurethrough dreams, can be related to Brude, Bruidhina and Bruidhina Maelasanu, aswell as Morgana, through the word Breuddwyd, pronounced Brith or Bridhe-wyd.Here in the realm of dreams we have a clear connection between the Fey and theHigh Druid castes. The Weaver of Dreams, the Sithann, is the weaver of fate orFey, and this role fell solely to the Druids and the Bruidhe caste therein. The Morgana or Morrigan, the black-cloaked Druidess, had as her totem the Raven.In Kabala, this bird, as stated further on, was related to N'h'sh the serpent,as a divinatory being, i.e. an interpreter of dreams. Furthermore, the Ravenitself was also identified with the white Dove. In a similar way to the Swan, itrepresents the brain and pineal gland, the Grail and the transference ofStarfire from the brain to the womb, as in the glyph of the Dove descending fromheaven with the paten, which it is depicted as depositing in the chalice.Consequently, we have a direct connection between the Morgana, Magdalene andMaelasanu, with the interchangeable symbols of the Raven, the Dove and the Swan(Caduceus of Hermes), which all relate to the N’h’sh or serpent of wisdom: theDragon. Therefore, as stated before, the Fairy identity lies within the PictishDruidic Kingly line. The same applies to the Vampire, as the suprememanifestation of the Vere-Tighema or ultimate overlord, the Witch and theDragon, the Elven Queen and the water nymph, siren and mermaid, all of which arethe Sumaire, the vortex of the grail. Another bird sacred to the Druids was the wren. In the Druidic tradition of thedouble entendre, Druid as dryw actually means wren. So it follows that theDruids identified themselves, in one sense, with this tiny bird. Why? One of the offshoots of the bardic order were called the Parasites, a name whichmight well have been applicable to the entire Scythian race. This Vampire racewas parasitical and, like the wren, it was very small in comparison to theclient tribes that it fed from. Like the Aryan tribe that it has been identifiedwith, the Scythian overlordship constituted by ratio, a minute percentage of theoverall population to which the arbitrary term “Celtic” has been attached. Thegreat Aryan migrations of 1800 BC were great migrations of whole tribes, whichincluded the tiny Aryan Tuadhe. In reality, neither the Scythians nor theirAryan parent culture were assimilationists and hence they always kept theirnumbers small and more or less pure-blooded. Compared to other cultures, theScythians were consequently likened in size to a wren compared to a goldeneagle, and this is the story of how the Druids adopted the wren as one of theirsymbols. It also explains their vampiristic nature and relationship to theirclient cultures. Nisse as a shortened version of the Fairy Nicol, Nicholas, Nick (Nix). (source:European Mythology, J. Simpson). Nix is German and it is a name associated withwater Elves. In German it also means zero, nil, nothing. One's memory is drawnback to:a) Dracula's mirror and consequently to;b) the “grail quest”, for the absence of ego or, in Zen Buddhist terms, thestill point of Zero—the Eternal Now—wherein lies all and nothing. Samael, as Mazda “the Light”, could only be perceived in just such a nil stateof ego annulment. As Satan or Old Nick he is therefore the Axle of “Hamlet'sMill”, the still, unturning centre point of the hub of the great cosmos, the nilpoint, the end of the journey, the pilgrim's destination, the sum of all thingsmen seek, which is nothing. Samael's identification as Mazda—the Light—is equal to Jesus' being identifiedin Revelations as the Bright and Morning Star or Venus-Lucifer. Jesus is Satanand Satan is the Still Point, the ultimate goal of all pilgrims. “Come unto me all ye who are weary, and I will give you rest.” The Lamb of God also wears Lucifer's horns. Subsequent to the seeker'sunravelling of this inversion of Samael or “Satan” by the Jews and theCatholics, there may be discovered therein the central teachings and tenets oftile Onosis of the Cathars and Templars. In Languedoc the Albigensians (albe = Elven + gens=blood: albegensian=Elvenblood) revered the Ankh Cross of the Inner Dragon Court, upon which wassuspended the crucified Christ-Serpent. The Ankh symbolises eternal youth and isreplicated in the Cross of Venus which, as the Star of the Morning, representsLucifer. In this way the true identity of Jesus and his antecedents can hardlybe mistaken. It would seem peculiar therefore, if he were not one of theWitches’ Gods. An example of this cross can be viewed at the Musee de Carcassonne. A similarcross of the 3rd century AD, a drawing of which is now in the Staatliche Museumof Berlin, shows the crucifixion of Orpheus-Bacchus. The vertical beam of thecross is surmounted by the upturned New Crescent Moon, which symbolises thevirgin womb of the goddess Diana. Formed into an arch above the scene are theseven stars of the Pleiades. Whilst Orpheus, Bacchus and Jesus were all crucified as saviour god figures,Jesus and Bacchus additionally share the sigil of the IHS or In Hoc SignoVinces. They are both, like Bacchus' Greek counterpart, Dionysus, associatedwith the vine, wine and blood ritual. The identification of Jesus as Luciferreplicates the role of Samael-Prometheus as the earlier benefactorsaviour of manbefore Christ. Jesus’ clan name was ben Panther and this animal, the Africanversion of the werewolf, was sacred to both Bacchus and Great Diana of Ephesus.IHS was attributed to Bacchus long before it was appropriated by the earlyChristians. Emblazoned onto Grail chalices, In Hoc Signo Vinces: “By This SignPrevail” pertains not to wine, as the supposed component of Bacchus' ecstaticmysteries, but blood, which was consumed as the elixir of life and the doorwayto eternal wisdom. It is evident that the followers of Jesus, the early Christians, and theBacchantes and Maenads of Bacchus and Dionysus, all drank blood as part of theirritual. This was a common feature of mystery cults across Eurasia, includingMithraism, whose devotees, like the Masai tribesmen of Kenya today, drank theblood of living bulls. However, in the two latter instances, the Bacchanalia and Dionysia, the ritesare reported as being particularly savage and also cannibalistic. Thiscorresponds to reports of the Vampiric and flesh eating practices or the moreprimitive manifestations within the lower orders of the Witches and Fairies ofBritain and France. In Scotland, the blood rituals were called the “Teind ofHell” and replicate the stories of the Vampires of Transylvania, one of whoseinitiatory grades, the Stregoi or Werewolf, lent its name to the followers ofDiana in Italy, the Stregas or Witches. The Teind of Hell, the sacrifice of a sacred individual by members of theFairy-Witch tribe, was accomplished in stages. The first stage was strangulationwith a ligature, the infamous Silken Points or Witches’ Garter. In later timesthe body was said to have been burned and the ashes scattered. What happenedbetween garrotting and burning remained a mystery and the purpose of the ritehas always been held to be motivated by a desire to promote fertility. Howeverthis was not always the case and some light might be shed on the mysteryconcerning both the rite and its reason by looking at a similar, but earlierseries of sacrifices which have come to light in recent history—the bog or poolpeople. In earlier times, from the pre-Christian Iron Age up until roughly the fifthcentury AD, the “victims” in these types of sacrifice were strangled and theblood was let from a wound made at the side of or across the throat. The intactbody was then placed either in a mere or peat bog, in contrast to beingcremated, as in later mediaeval examples of this process. Of particular interestis the case of Lindow Man in Cheshire. This individual was strangled and his throat was slit. A wound, made by a daggeror similar instrument, was found on the top of his skull. There appears to be asimilar process in the killing and disposal of the other bog bodies that havebeen found across Europe. Firstly the garrotting was not fatal strangulation.This being the case, the theories of some forensic experts concerning LindowMan, that the ligature made no scar and was therefore nothing more than anecklace, cannot be sustained. The garrotte was not meant to kill, but to render the victims insensible.Secondly, the victims' “live” blood was then drained off and drunk. In allVampire tales it will be noted that “dead” blood is held to be useless. Thirdly,at death, an aperture was made in the top of the skull—quite specifically a typeof trepanned hole. Through this the spirit could leave the body and travel as anintercessor to the Otherworld via the Fairy portal, symbolised by the waterygrave, the Mere or bog in which, fourthly, the corpses were interred. That thebodies were left intact seems to be a fair indication that the victim's soulswere not meant to act as portal guardians. The practice of trepanning was commonamongst the Egyptians and their later descendants the Merovingians. They bothhave a Dragon ancestry shared with the Druids who were, it is generally agreed,often the most likely victims and perpetrators of the bog killings. These wereritual precursors to the Teind of Hell sacrifices of the Witches, theirdescendants. The drinking of the blood, practiced in Mithraism, early Christianity, Bacchicand Dionysic worship, was the Act of Eucharist. It took on the powers andcharacteristics of the divine victims whose sacrifice had a dual role. That is,it enabled them to go beyond and communicate to the god-ancestors on behalf ofthe Clan, and it provided their blood as spiritual sustenance and fortitude forthe priests left behind. In battle, Scythian Warriors practiced similar ritesand an old saying of theirs goes, “The blood of an enemy is sweet, but sweeterstill the blood of a friend”. Like the collecting of severed heads as trophies, supposedly by the Celts, thepractice of drinking the blood of the fallen in battle was intended by thepractitioners to add to their own strength. In the case of head-hunting, thebody of the fallen protagonist thus mutilated would trap the soul in the headand its virility in the mortal realm, where it was enslaved by the livingwarrior to increase his own might. The Celts, like the Greeks, and laterDescartes, believed that the soul resided in the head. In this head huntingtradition, one can firmly place the Valkirie and the Morrigan or Morganas. Bothare related to the Swan Maidens of the Mere and are “Ladies of the Lake”, andthus Mermaids. The Valkirie were said to take the souls of the fallen heroes toValhalla. It is by looking at the Scythian Morrigan however, that the method ofdispatch used by their Nordic cousins, the Valkirie shield maidens, can beascertained. The Morganas were the goddesses of the battlefield and were likened to theRavens. The Raven is another bird sacred both to Odin and Lilith in theQliphothic Kabala, next to the owl and the Dove (Magdalene). It is a carrionbird that feeds on the fallen and was invariably to be found at the scenes ofbattle, feeding from the dead and dying. It is highly likely that the Morganas,the Ladies of the Lake who took Arthur off to Avalon, swept across thebattlefields of their day, dressed in black, drinking the blood of the fallen.Thereby, like Odin's Valkiries, despatching them to the Otherworld or Tir NaNog, the “Celtic” Valhalla. The Morganas, of which Melusine was one, were thedaughters of Lilith. They were the Druidesses and Mermaid guardians of theAvalons, the sacred groves on the Fairy Island Mounds in the midst of the SwanLakes that, for the Celts and their overlords the Scythians, were the doorwaysto eternity. Mithraism or Mazdaism, named after Mazda or Enki-Samael, was, like other mysteryreligions which came before and after it, an ancient derivation of the originalAryan-Scythian philosophy which originated with the Anunnaki. Its blood rituals,along with those others presently under discussion here, were a decadent form ofthe Vampirism practiced by those first Dragon Gods of Sumeria. The original formof their rites became corrupted, but were reconstituted as Alchemy—and later asCourtly Love and Royal Witchcraft in the first millennium AD, whilst the moreprimitive forms persisted in tandem across Europe. All, however, at one point oranother, suffered the disapprobation of the Catholic Church. "},{"pageContent":"[images/00082.jpg]Chapter 35 The Ladder of Lights During the medieval period, it is said that the Jewish Divines appear to haveformulated the glyph of the Tree of Life to elucidate upon the teachings of theKabala. The actual tree, however, is far more ancient. Later western occultistsbecame enamoured of the Kabala and the Tree of Life and inserted their ownquasi-Christian symbolism into the system. Whether either the Jewish mystics orthe Christian Occultists are aware of it or not, the Tree of Life, which seemsto have been copied from much earlier non-Hebrew sources, appears to be as mucha genealogical chart as it is a magical glyph. And it is by understanding it as a family tree that the truly magical elementsit conceals can be more fully appreciated. Each sphere or Sephiroth on the Treeis essentially a theurgic dynamic. These forces or gods bear the names of theoriginal Elohim, the Dragon Kings and Queens of the Anunnaki. The position ofeach sphere on the Tree corresponds with the relationships enjoyed by each ofthe gods with each other, so the spheres represent husbands, mothers, fathers,brides, sons and daughters. In the Christian Occult Kabala, the eighth Sephiroth, Tiphareth, is thought torepresent Christ and the Cubic Stone. This, the philosopher's elixir, the LapsitExellis or Fallen Star would, if such it be, serve to reinforce the identity ofthe Christ with Lucifer. However, the Cubic Stone is a component of the Grail.The Grail is a chalice, a female symbol, as is Venus, the Bright and MorningStar, who is Lucifer. Here there would seem to be a confusion of gender-relatedsymbols, but there isn't. In an earlier essay it was suggested that Christosmeant not the man, but the anointing. Earlier versions of the Chrism or Christoswere called the semen of God, the divine pneuma, the Logos or Holy Spirit.George Riley-Scott has suggested in Phallic Worship that this enlivened the mindof the anointed one, thus bringing enlightenment or “salvation”. See Scott'scomments on the Bethel Stone. It would, however, be more correct to call thisChrism the semenal fluid of the Goddess rather than that of God, as the HolySpirit is traditionally female, being Astarte or Sophia, meaning wisdom. The saving body and blood of Christ, the anointing of the Christos of Astarte orSophia, thus becomes recognised as being the ovum and menstruus of the Goddess.At the beginning of the first millennium, she was represented by Mary Magdalene,the Scarlet Woman, who some say was the Priestess of Ishtar or Venus. If theTree is taken as a genealogical chart then Tiphareth occupies a position mid waybetween Geburah (Samael Enki) and Chesed (Jehovah Enlil). In Anunnaki tradition,this place on the family tree would be occupied by the Dragon Queen, Nin Kursag.She was wife to both Enki and Enlil and the grandmother of Ishtar or Venus, whois represented on the Tree by Netsach, positioned in exactly the same place onthe Tree, as Ishtar is on the chart. Essentially, therefore, Nin Kursag, calledthe Lady of Life, was the First or Great Venus, wife of Enki Samael or Lucifer,hence the association between the two. One of her responsibilities was to feed the Dragon Kings with her blood andwater, both of which together comprise the prima materiae of alchemy, the“Christos”, in order to expand their consciousnesses and increase their lifespans. This exactly replicates the phenomenon attributed to the Grail and theCubic Stone. Magdalene, similarly, is suspected of having performed the samefunction. Like Nin Kursag, her predecessor and her goddess, she also providedher womb, in her proper season. This served as the vessel within which, in NinKursag's case, was carried the forefather of the subsequent Dragon Kings andfrom whom, in Mary's turn, Jesus' children were descended as scions of the rootand branch of the Dragon Tree, the Planta Genista of the Anunnaki. In some depictions of the Kabalistic Tree of Life we can seen entwined withinits branches a Dragon or serpent. Said by some to represent the wisdom of “God”descending from Kether to Malkuth, rather it suggests that the Dragon Blood ofthe great mother touches and infuses all the Sephira which symbolise the DragonGoddess-Queens and God-Kings, whose family tree it is. That serpent is Tiamat,the “Tree Mother” whose realm is Tir Na Nog. The secondary function of the Kabalistic Tree of Life is to enshrine the secretwisdom that made the Dragons what they were. The utilisation of the Grail systemwhich gave them their power relied upon the charting of the endocrinal system,the enhancing of hormonal output and the collection of the Christos. Thisinformation can be found in what is called the Middle Pillar of the Tree ofLife, and the position of the Gods in relation to each other therein, doubles upas the position of the glands within the human body. "},{"pageContent":"[images/00065.jpg]Chapter 36 Hearts and Flowers Tiphareth can be understood as both Christ and Female at the same time if oneregards the situation in the foregoing manner. To this may be incorporated theessay findings regarding Ichthys, the Fish, and the Salmon of Knowledge as theChristos or Menstruus emanating from the Vulva or Cubic Stone of the Goddess orthe Scarlet Woman, represented by that Fish. The earliest manifestation of thistradition amongst the Dragon Goddesses of the Anunnaki serves as the origin oftrue vampirism as an act, not of Freudian sexual violence or perversion, but ofnecessity, love and nurturance. Royal Vampirism has been horribly corrupted at various times. However, one mightsay that Solomon and Jesus, and the Royal Covens whose blood fed the Fairy Kingsright up to and beyond the time of the Reformation, adhered the most closely tothe original Draconian concept. They assisted in their own way in themaintenance and furtherance of proper alchemy and the concept of Courtly Love.Indeed it can be said that various exoteric aspects of this Vampire traditionemerged in its royal form, principally through the poetic works of thetroubadours. They originally wrote and performed in the Occitan language ofProvence, and contributed greatly to the birth of the Age of Romance and theseemingly fundamental change in some men's idealised views of women and thefunction and conduct of male-female interactions. However, the key components of the philosophy seem to have been omitted orsuppressed. It could be argued that women's fortunes have not been improved byour culture adopting only the trace elements of a tradition that, with itsessential ingredients missing, has had only limited success. The concept ofromantic love, with its original purpose perverted and its magical contentremoved, has been the ruin of countless lives. Human nature has regularly failedto acquit itself against the reality of human expectation. This has resulted indomestic violence and misery and in the annulment of marriages inspired by aconcept of romantic love that never was intended to have anything to do withmundane human bonding, mating or propagation. It certainly had nothing to dowith the idealised foundation upon which couples outside the Dragon traditionexpectantly and inadvisably build such breeding arrangements. Courtly Love Romance and everyday romance are two entirely different concepts,and it is not realistic to expect everyone to live up to what, in Dragon terms,is an achievable reality, but which, in human terms, is no more than a somewhatdisappointing, market-driven and unattainable ideal. Courtly Love was a feedingarrangement intended to result, not in marriage on the mundane level, but inhierogamy and transcendence on the highest of all levels of organic experience. The efficacy of such successful alliances relied both upon the genetic originand age of the female. In these terms alone, these qualifications in themselveswere sufficient to have excluded the majority of the female population ofEurope. The remainder who were biologically suitable and ritually adept onlyserved a few short years as an alchemical or divine lover before their bloodchemistry altered. They then moved on to form dynastic alliances where thecentral concern was not “Romance” or “True Love”, but the purity of the DragonBlood and the well-being of the Dragon offspring. As a consequence, and contrary to our present mores and social expectations,Romantic or Courtly Love and the unrealistic illusion of romantic monogamy werediametrically opposed to each other. The efficacy of the former would eventuallydecline if it were expected that such could continuously and permanentlyfunction in tandem with the biochemical shortcomings related to the built-inobsolescence innate within the latter. The two were simply mutually exclusiveconcepts. However, formerly the Church and latterly, burgeoning market forces,have conditioned us to expect that we and the entire population should “Fall InLove” and marry for such love. In reality the majority haven't got a clue what“love” really is, beyond the imposition of their projections on another. If love is understood to be the emotional manifestation accompanying a sociallyacceptable interactive norm which expresses or satisfies people's domestic orerotic expectations, then love is just a collection of egocentric illusionsunderpinned by self-deception and self-interest. It is wrapped in the prettypackaging of self-sacrifice and altruism, because people have never been taughtthe philosophy underlying the principal of Courtly or True Romantic Love. In anycase, they are psychobiologically incapable of ever attaining it. Consequentlythey are unaware that true love is the destruction of the self through another,not the fulfilment of the self through another. Love is Death, not acquisition.Love is the end of desire, not the object of its own continuous gratification. Singularly, Courtly Love may be described as the hormonally driven hunger toextract organo-chemical compounds from the Grail Maiden for ingestion. It is notthe hormonally driven, somewhat cynical desire on the part of the male to injectunwanted genetic waste material into her for entertainment. The fundamentaldifference between Courtly Love and domestic congress is one of hormonalimperative. One activity is driven by an entirely different set of hormones thanthe other. Unlike the urge to frequently nominally replicate, Courtly Love orRoyal Vampirism is most certainly not inspired or driven by testosterone oroestrogen. The litmus test for detecting the presence of the Dragon genome andthose aforementioned propensities within themselves now, is to make a mentalcheck as to whether or not one has often felt previously an urgent and recurrentinclination to eat the chicken without actually stuffing it. If this is indeed the case, then you may congratulate yourself on havingdiscovered an entirely new vessel of potential, sailing under the hithertounknown flag of the Dragon in sacred waters you would otherwise never haveguessed existed. Vampires' mothers always taught their children not to play withtheir food. That way it keeps better and lasts longer. Upon this principal isfounded the basis of Courtly Love, a singular exercise in self discipline forthe male or female Dragon beneficiary, providing hours of gratuitous,pleasurable diversion for the female Dragon benefactress. The end result of this ritually structured arrangement is a transcendent dynamicprincipal which leads to the experience of or continued abidance within Truth,or True Love, if you wish to call it that. This has nothing to do with thegenetic imperative, buying matching curtains and soft furnishings or gettinganother set of keys cut. "},{"pageContent":"[images/00031.jpg] Chapter 37 Sexual Communication AmongstAnimals and Humans What are pheromones? Pheromones are naturally secreted chemicals you can smell in the odour producedthrough the sweat glands of the body. In mammals, pheromones play an importantrole in the establishment of their territories: the marking activities ofpriests and dogs; the use of incense, and urinating against trees and lamppostsare well-known examples. In a mouse the sexual and territorial marking functionscome together when the female ovulates [produces an egg] after smelling a male. Some primates, like the baboon, secrete pheromones during their receptivity tosex. In man the functions of pheromones are not totally clear, but we do knowthat smell plays a role in our attraction to a member of the opposite sex.However, today's propensity for covering our bodies with unnatural odours, likeperfumes and deodorants, has probably led to a decline in our sensitivity andreceptivity to these more natural odours. Whatever it is that attracts us originally to a particular member of theopposite sex, one thing is certain. That is, that there are some chemicalhormones we produce that have their role when we are playing the mating game. The Function of the Relevant Hormones in Human Beings and the advantages andpitfalls of sexual communication: Across a crowded room1) When you are first attracted to someone, the principal sensory stimulus isusually visual. In this particular instance, perhaps in a social context, theeye sends messages along the nerve endings to the brain and the brain releasestwo hormones, vasopressin and dopamine, which begin to act during the phase ofheightened attention, in order to assess the object’s suitability as a potentialmate. If the object continues to attract one, and advances are reciprocated,another hormone is released. This chemical, serotonin or 5-hydroxytriptamine,one of the amine group of stimulants similar to amphetamine, begins to produce afeeling of euphoria and excitement. By a process of association, this feelingbecomes related to the immediacy of the object of desire as the interactiondevelops. If the couple are mutually attracted and begin to take each other's advancesseriously, the brain releases two other hormones, oxytocin and prolactin. Theseact on the mind to produce a feeling of bonding which, in anticipation of orduring subsequent encounters, grows stronger, along with the sense ofcentredness or focus and euphoria felt in the presence of the other person,produced by the accompanying vassopresin, dopamine and Serotonin respectively.The whole process is called psychosomatic, inasmuch as the chemicals producedact on the brain and stimulate various emotional and intellectual responses inthe mind. In tandem with the release of these hormones, when the subjects firstenter physical proximity, traces of pheromone will be released to stimulate aheightened level of secretion of the other hormones in order to increase theoverall effect of attraction. And so to bed…Two powerful hormones are also released by the sex organs during this wholeprocess. They are oestrogen in the female and testosterone in the male.Prolactin is predominantly a female hormone which is secreted in breast milk.When prolaction is released in the male, he is also likely to release traces ofOestrogen, whilst the female will release traces of Testosterone. The reason why members of the opposite sex produce hormones not readilyassociated with their gender is that testosterone in the female enables her tojudge the masculine qualities in her prospective sexual partner, whilst the samehappens with oestrogen in the male. The preliminary chemical phases completed,the sexual hormones will stimulate the desire to copulate and sexual intercoursetakes place. After the sex act, the levels of hormones plummet and remain lowfor hours, sometimes for a day or so, until the brain chemicals resume aheightened level again and stimulate the couple to copulate again. This wholeprocess is reactive and based almost entirely on conditioned responsesstimulated by a variety of chemicals working together to act upon the centralnervous system and the mind. The process is mediated and modified by personalinclinations and social conditioning. In our society, until very recently,encounters between males and females for purely sexual purposes of recreation orfun were discouraged. The initial feelings produced by the neurotransmitterswere described by moralists as the process of “falling in love”. Fantasy FeelingsThe guardians of the nation's moral welfare ascribed a spiritual and romanticquality to this. It was an illusory and unrealistic dimension, in which theestablishment encouraged people to disassociate with and separate from theprocreative act. This delusion was promulgated more for political and socialreasons rather than from any altruistic desire to educate, enlighten or preventthe transmission of sexually transmitted diseases. One wasn't supposed tocopulate unless one was married to or had “fallen in love” with one'sprospective sexual partner. It seems odd to say that one mustn't engage in thefulfilment of one hormonal process unless the other had first taken place. Thefeelings associated with falling in love are focus, bonding and, mostimportantly from a psychobiological point of view—elation. All of these derivefrom purely chemical reactions and have nothing to do with real Love whatsoever.If they did, people wouldn't fall out of love as often as they do. The flowerymoralistic attitude which encourages people to have such unrealistic notionsabout the purely natural processes we all undergo creates expectations about thepotential of human relationships which are pure fantasy. During a relationship, the brain slowly reduces the levels of the “falling inlove” hormones. Because of this some people find that their relationships becomemediocre and boring. They often blame this on the other person, which is alsounrealistic and sometimes quite unfair. The reason that the relationship haslost that “buzz” is that the serotonin levels have dropped. For this reason manypeople constantly seek new people with whom to fall in love. In truth, theyaren't in love with the person at all, but rather with the “drug rush” and the“chemical high” that human encounters so often afford. In reality it isadvisable to know the truth and to take a long look at a subject that is sooften misunderstood and often poorly and incompetently covered in nationaleducation. Because of the consequent ignorance and romantic idealism beingfostered, it can cause much personal misery and social chaos. England Expects Every Man to Do his DutySociety has trained people to harbour unworkable moral ideals about humannature. It encourages them to attempt to adhere, and expect their fellow humansto adhere, to standards of behaviour that are frankly dishonest andunreasonable. Subsequently people's expectations in a variety of socialinteractions with their fellows, including bonding and mating, are full ofdeceit and hypocrisy. The projections of a fashionable moral ideal can changeconfusingly from decade to decade. If people were trained to be themselves, thensociety and social interactions would be a lot healthier and more enjoyable,leading to far less disillusionment and bitterness on an individual and nationalscale. Beyond the Fantasy Honesty produces natural centredness and clarity. In such a mental condition itis possible to perceive a transcendent quality in life which many have calledTrue Love. It has nothing to do with sexual attraction or acquisition. It is inno other way dependent upon or relative to human behaviour or experience. Thisquality, when on occasion it becomes the foundation of human interactions, goesbeyond the merely sexual or emotional to produce a state of communication andcompassion that sexuality, with all the greed, selfdeceit and cruelty that oftenaccompanies it, can never understand or provide. When entering into a relationship it would be a lot more honest for one to buildits foundations on something far more substantial and meaningful than a sense ofsexual or romantic, chemically-derived titillation. It would then stand a fargreater chance of being successful. The Cathars are known to have proscribed against any form of intercourse whichwould result in fecundity. The exoteric reason they gave for this was thatprocreation produced more matter and that matter caused pain and suffering. Thereal reason was that they favoured alchemical, non-procreative relationships forthe very same reason the Holy Bible feverishly rails against them with its “Sinof Onan”, “increasing one's tent pegs” and so forth. Jehovah encouragedcopulation because it bred more terrified slaves. The Catholics hated alchemicalmarriages because they liberated the mind from slavery and didn't produce anymore brainless, but brainwashed, cash machines. The Vatican's proscriptionagainst contraception is simply a recruitment-through-breeding programme. Nevermind overpopulation, environmental catastrophe or social deprivation. As long asthe fat foodboys* have enough catamites, whores, cigarettes and alcohol by eachsuccessively bred batch of tithe-paying morons, they and theirmulti-denominational scions can sit back and the whole planet can implode forall they care. *Foodboys was a term of derision and contempt used by Yugoslav soldiers on allsides during the Bosnian conflict to describe their politicians. The “foodboys”sat back at home behind the lines cashing the welfare cheques from the WorldBank and spending the money on luxury residences, flashy cars and fast women, orvice versa. In the meantime, everybody else was enduring a living hell.Politicians, priests—what's the difference? "},{"pageContent":"[images/00033.jpg]Chapter 38 A Rose by Any Other Name? The Church's insistence on differentiating between Paganism and Christianity isabsurd. Many so-called modern Wiccans, unaware of its higher purpose, think of“their religion” as being pre-Christian and pagan. Witchcraft was viewed by theInquisition as being heresy. However, a belief can only be heretical if it is atvariance with that which is viewed as being its orthodox parent doctrine. Witchcraft could not be heretical unless it was considered to be a Christianreligion in the first place. Even though Witchcraft can be said to bepre-Christian in origin, its contributory cult, Jesus' form of Christianity, isalso pre-Christian in origin. This makes a nonsense of the arguments on allsides, as well as the partisan labels used variously by Wiccans andsensationalists alike to define, contrastingly, Witchcraft as a pagan religioncompared with Christianity. In Roman Catholic terms, Jesus would have been labelled a Witch and his cult aheresy against the true faith of mother Church. If he had timed his secondcoming to coincide with the medieval period, he would have been burnt at thestake by the Inquisition. However, in true primal Christian terms and incomparison to Jesus’ original teachings, Roman Christianity and all itscollaterals and splinter groups, including modern so-called “born-againChristians” are themselves wicked idolatries and evil heresies. Jesus warned offalse prophets. All we have had for over 1600 years is false prophets and wolvesin sheeps’ clothing. It has been said that Jehovah roams across the face of theEarth like a lion, seeking whomever he may devour. The Witches of the Basque worshipped a God called Jauna or Janicot. De Lancreregarded this as a diminutive, which he said meant Petit Jean—which was the nameapplied by the Witches of the Basses Pyrenees to Christ. With regard to Hamlet's Mill, Witches would often meet in windmills. In magicalterms these structures sympathetically represented, on the microcosmic level,the Great, Ever-Turning Mill of the Cosmos, so anything done by a Witch in awindmill, it was believed, would be replicated magically in the greateruniverse. 1) Petit Jean translates into English as Little John, a companion of Robin Hood.It is possible that Robin and Little John were aspects of the one character,repeating the Jesus-Lucifer composite. It does not appear that these two aspectswere conflicting, but rather that the early devotees were at pains to convey theidea that Jesus and Lucifer were the same person, and that Jehovah, if hefigured at all, would have been the dark aspect. 2) Jauna is Janus, and Janicot is Janus-God, the two-faced guardian of portals.Being two-faced, Janus is similar to the gods of Mazdaism and Gnostic Dualism,which represent the forces of light and dark, of “God” and “Satan”. It issignificant that Jesus is worshipped by Witches, and that some Witch names fortheir “devil” and his followers are associated with Jesus, such as Christsonday,or Christ-son-Dei, Christ son of God. One is reminded of Columba'sassertion—“Jesus, Mo Drui, Mac Dei”. Quite often Witches took for themselves thename “Christian”, or picked Witch names directly from biblical sources. It becomes increasingly difficult to dismiss the idea that an early, homogenous,Levantine type of Witchcraft was the original form of Christianity, originatingfrom the same mystical Eurasian root philosophy that gave birth to Druidism inAnatolia and the north-west, and Hinduism and Mazdaism in the east. In thiscase, the Dualism of Jesus-Lucifer is not the reconciling of opposites in Janus.Rather, in that guise, he is the identification of the Witches’ god as thePontiff or bridge, like the Druidic Blue Boar of the Irish Chronicles, but withfaces looking both ways. Jesus is a guide to souls travelling to Faery. This Sonof Solomon is an Elvish Lord who straddles the space between the worlds andconversely, like Hermes, he is also the messenger of the Gods to Man. It isworth noting that both Hermes and St. Nicholas are the patrons of thieves. Onethief in particular, Prometheus, comes to mind. He stole fire from the gods togive to man. Prometheus is Samael or Old Nick. Robin is also known as the“Prince of Thieves”. "},{"pageContent":"[images/00066.jpg]Chapter 39 Jesus and Robin Robin could be seen, in one sense, to have symbolically robbed the gold “ofprivileged, initiated wisdom”, hoarded by the wealthy, and given it freely tothe poor. Conversely, the wealthy who were entertained by Robin paid dearly forthe privilege of gaining such wisdom. “He who would keep his life shall lose it, but he who would lose his life shallgain the whole world.” The rich merchant gave up his entire fortune to purchase one Pearl of GreatPrice—Transcendent Wisdom. In this sense the adage “It is easier for a camel topass through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom ofHeaven” is also applicable. The riches of this world keep the mind fixed on thecares and pleasures of this world. In order to perceive the “Otherworld”, thetranscendent reality, it is necessary to focus one's attention on matters farremoved from the pleasures of the senses. In this sense, the pleasure of Robin'sFeast would cost a man dearly, for his feast was that of the spirit. In order totaste its delights, a man must give up everything that ties him to his ownworld. Several stories concerning Robin tell of his hospitality and also thatthose he often entertained were often persuaded to part with everything they hadin exchange for the board and entertainment they received. Considering Robin’sRitual identity the symbolism appears pertinent. In northern Europe, the ancient Nick or Neck held such sway amongst the peoplethat the Church was forced to adopt and canonise him as St. Nicholas. InCornwall, St. Nicholas still retains his horns. Being much older than Nicholasof Myra, it is far more likely that this horned St. Nicholas is the model forFather Christmas. The traditions linked to him are distinctly northern Europeanand related to Hearne and Odin. In Professor Margaret Murray's work on the Witchcult and the Witches’ god, the Deity whom the Church called the Devil or Satanwas known in Sweden as the (Witches’) antecessor or ancestor. This also suggeststhat in Sweden the Witches were related by blood to their “Devil”, either theirFairy Master or Mistress. They were also related to the Devil's Elven ancestors. In Britain he was known as Puck (Boucca or Bog/Bolg meaning God) and RobinHoodor Goodfellow. Murray cites at least ten references for the God being namedRobin, whilst in Orkney be was known intriguingly as “Walliman”, which means,one assumes, Wood Lord, another rendering of Robin's title and of the title ofHearne/Cernunnos/Vishnu. The Druidhe were also known as the men/women of theTrees (or Tree), which is another variation of the Wood Lords or Lords of theForest, the Calle Daouine. Bearing this in mind it is feasible that Witchcraftwas an underground continuation of Druidism in decline, as indeed Murray hassuggested. In Britain the God or Goddess was a man of the Fairy race, of flesh and blood.Nevertheless he, or sometimes she, was worshipped still as deity. Perhaps likeJesus, they became, as Avatars or living representations, the sons or daughtersof the great Goddess-God of the Vast Cosmos. Significantly, the Witches’“goddess”, Diana, was one of the four classical Titanias or Titanesses, theother three were Circe the Witch, Pyrrha and Latona. The Titanias, and henceDiana, were all Queens of Elphame. The Swedish name “Ancestor” seems appropriatehere, especially as Witchcraft is seen by Murray as a Fairy “religion”. Inancient Fairy tradition the Elves themselves were the gods, the Ubaid orAnunnaki (Anunnagi), who were later and elsewhere revered as the Titans, theGods of the Aryan Hindu pantheon, the Pharaohs, the Gods of Israel, the Tuathade Danaan and the Catholic Saints. Murray says that she believes Witchcraft to be the leftovers of the religion ofthe Fairy race of the Neolithic period. The word Neolithic automatically makesus think of the word primitive and it conjures up images of cave men and woodenclubs. The Ages—Neolithic, Iron or Bronze could easily run concurrentlyaccording to the wealth or dearth of resources of any region that any particularpopulation inhabited. Whilst Britain was in its Bronze Age, other regions hadbeen using iron for centuries. The point has been made that we tend to judge aperiod or Age by its artefacts and come to the mistaken conclusion that a racewas primitive simply because we rarely tend to find less durable goods thanstone or metal. Settled agricultural populations in the temperate zone have more free time todevelop technologies than migrant pastoral communities or peoples inhabitingmore hostile environments. However, civilisations can and do go into decline.Highly developed settled communities have been known to become low technologymigrants because of local disasters or because the type of agriculture they wereusing did not work in the long term, or because resources dried up. Someone oncesaid that civilisation is only three inches deep, that being a common depth ofusable topsoil. Migrant communities would be forced to use the materialsavailable to them in the new homelands in which they resettled. If the only landavailable was infertile or sparse in mineral resources, the most advancedcommunities of the time could plummet back down the developmental ladder,possibly becoming “Neolithic” again. Witchcraft, rather than originating as a cave man's religion, was the decadentsurvival of a highly evolved Eurasian philosophy. It migrated to Britain andlater absorbed the accretions of numerous settlers and invaders including theDanes, who seem to have held out against Christianity for far longer than theAnglo Saxons. It is highly likely that what we think of as Witchcraft was not in fact anindigenous Neolithic British religion but was imported by the Picts as their“Fairy Religion”—Druidism. This was devastated by the Romans and later, in itsvarying corrupted forms, took on other influences as the centuries passed. It isrecorded that up until the Reformation period, Witches still practiced thePictish Scythian custom of whole body tattooing, of which the socalled “Witches’mark” was a minor but nevertheless culturally associated manifestation. The markwas originally a wound opened to let blood, which was consumed by the “Devil”.The wound was then pigmented with soot or woad and acted as a sign of thesacrifice made by the Witch on her initiation, thereby marking her as one of theWitches’ clan. Royal Covens did not use this practice. This marking practice hasalso been discovered on the Italian Ice Mummy named Oetzi. He was covered inmarks that corresponded to the meridian points in acupuncture. The meridian mapis related to and incorporates the outer columns on the Kabalistic Tree of Life,thereby lending further support to the academic assertion that acupuncture waslearnt by the Chinese, not invented by them. Oetzi's body was over 5000 yearsold. One particular influence, the Danish or Nordic, has given us historically, insome regions of Britain, a Witches’ god who wears a grey cloak and blue hood ormantle. The choice of colours indicates that the god figure here is thearchetypal “Lord Of The Rings”, Odin or Hooden. The hood is specificallyassociated with Fairies, as it is with Robin Hood, his Pictish-Gallic double orcounterpart. The Fairy Hood can be found associated with the Haxi Hood game.This was originally a sort of football played with a decapitated, hooded head, asacrifice intended to make a portal guardian—and also with the remains of thesacrificial victim we know as Tollund Man, who was excavated in Scandinavia,Odin's old stomping ground. Where the God appears otherwise in the shape of an animal, this tends toindicate that in Britain, a Pictish tribal totem was being revered in much thesame way as the Scandinavian Witches’ “ancestor” (antecessor) would be. Theanimal shape assumed by the local “Devil” represented the heraldic badge of theRoyal tribe from which the “god” originated (amongst the Fairy race). Pictish tribes used different animal totems as tribal arms or badges and thesechanged according to the status or function of the tribe—as Druids, smiths,warriors and so on. The grades within the hierarchy of tribes within a Tuadhawere also denoted by animal symbols, such as the Dragon, Eagle, Bull, Boar,Wolf, Goat, Stag, Horse, Salmon and so on. Depending on the country or region,there were variations in the type of animals depicted by the resident tribes.Originally the totem system might well have followed an initiatory grade, orcaste system, similar to that manifested respectively in Mithraism or Mazdaism,and Hinduism, all of which originate from the same Indo-European root culture,the early proto-Aryan Scythians. Likewise, the grades may well have beenoriginally associated with the seven Chakras or Sephira. Certainly in Transylvania, the earliest known homeland of the Dragon Kings, theVampire comes in various grades, including the Dragon, Bird, Boar and Wolf—anOdinic totem animal. Similarly, Vishnu in the Hindu pantheon follows a similarseries of earthly manifestations in animal form including the Blue Boar,indicating an ancient link between all these cultural icons and concepts.Consequently, the local Witches’ god representative may well have dressed as theanimal formerly associated with the tribe of his ancestral origins, or of thetribe associated with the region within which the Witches lived. "},{"pageContent":"[images/00031.jpg]Chapter 40 Santa Claus As Old Nick, Jesus and Robin are therefore variants of St. Nicholas, who was theCeltic Hearne, the Lord of the Forest (Brahma-Vishnu-Shiva/Sidha), Odin theblinded (late composite version of Anu/Samael), and the Finnish shamanicwanderer, who travelled on a Sled drawn by Reindeer. It is pertinent to remindoneself at this point of the Pict-Sidhes, and of Amanita Muscaria. In the bleakof midwinter which, as a season, could have magically represented the wastelandof the Grail, he would come down from on high (slip down the chimney pole[descend the magic tree] of the snowdrift covered, half-hidden tepes) and leavegifts (fruit and food) for the occupants. This in a sense, may symbolise the god giving succour to his beleaguereddevotees, pilgrims on the journey of life, who were symbolically seekingguidance, sustenance and direction in the wasteland. His teachings helped tokeep them resolute in winter's “dark night of the soul” and give them wisdom tocontinue the journey up the Tree. The fruit traditionally given at Christmassymbolised the Sephira and their wisdom, which both Odin/Samael/Lucifer andJesus had obtained by hanging from a sacrificial Tree. One is also reminded ofMoses and the Israelites in the desert wasteland, and Moses' brazen serpent heldup on a “tree” or Tepes (a pole), as a symbol of healing. In this connection I have heard it said that the custom of hanging baubles fromthe Christmas Tree was symbolic of the semen of the God who was represented bythat tree. It is conceivable, but more probable is the idea that the baublesrepresent the Sephira and the tree, in its esoteric sense, is a Goddess. Here one is further reminded of the figure of Samael as the serpent entwinedaround Lilith, his Tree. In connection with Moses' serpent staff as a healingsymbol, the serpent is again Samael. He is a precursor to the Fisher King, whois healed by the Grail, i.e. the Woman who, as the Cup, is also the Tree orStaff around which he, Samael, the Serpent Fisher King, is entwined and healed. One recollects the shaman's journey back up the magical tree. In Runic, Tree isspelt Tir and is represented by an upturned spear-like glyph reminiscent of theTepes or Dragon Pole (Sarkany) found in Sidhe Mounds. We should look at Tir NaNog, the “Land of Youth”, to see if the word Tir in Gaelic has a conceptualrelationship with tree and house. Although mistakes have been made with regardto the academic understanding of the origins of Gaelic ideas and words, the“Land of Youth” is associated with the “Tree of Ogmios”—Tir Na Nog. Oghma is a Danaan God who, like Odin, is credited with discovering a magicalscript associated with the Otherworld. In Odin's case, this was Runic and wasattained through death on the Tree Yggdrasil. In Oghma's case, the script heobtained has been called the language of the trees. Formulated in about 400 ADas a written script based on Latin, it originated with continental Druids as asystem of magical symbols in about 500 BC. Of further interest is the connectionbetween the words Og and Och, as in Och Aye and Occitan, the language ofProvence. It is distinguished by its use of the word Och for yes, in place ofOui in the French. Og or Och—yes—are affirmatives or assertives, these wordsbeing the primary foundation of the positive state of mind and the willunderlying all magic, the state of mind that allows and accepts; and therebylearns wisdom. Och is the Oath positively asserted, and for the Druids the Oath was truth.Allowing a synthesis between these concepts we might further discover a Tree ofYouth or Tree of Life, and a Land of Youth attained by ascending that Tree.Perhaps we might also discover that Tia Mat or Tir Mater, is the Mother Tree orTree Mother. She was the original womb of the Fairy race and the first Lady ofthe Forest, the first Grail Princess who was both the tree and the fountain ofmagical wisdom—Ogham, and the “Source” or “Land of Eternal Youth”—Tir Na Nog.Perhaps also, ascending the Tree could be seen as a sacrifice of self asreturning to the Mother, to the womb of the Otherworld— Tir Na Nog—and thus todeath, the ultimate truth. Nothing. This sacrifice, death on a “Tree”, is symbolic of the total submission to thefemale which is found in Courtly Love. She is the Tree, as we have seen in otheressays, and as such is the implement by which the Priest King is “destroyed”,and thus healed. The total submission however, is ultimately to the Nix ornothingness, which her nature affords and her soul reflects. She is the EgyptianNuit, the boundless abyss of infinite space beyond time. Her fruits sustain andnurture the Cernunnos or Odin, the Priest-King-Magician who, in turn, nurturesand sustains his supplicants and followers. Similarly, Jesus (Moses' BrazenSerpent) descended from his Rood Tree and was thus “resurrected”. He gave giftsof the fruits of its (Her or Death's) wisdom when in transcendence. He preachedto his disciples. In these tales, where Jesus, Robin and Odin, or Hearne, as the original SantaClaus, gave gifts to the poor and needy, the essential elements ofMagician-Priest-Kingship are manifest. It was the King's duty to sustain andguide the people. He could only do this through sacrificing his ego to the Nix,and by uniting with it to perceive the transcendent wisdom. He could only dothat by “hanging from a tree”, by “riding Epona or Slepnir to the Otherworld”.Thus a king could only be a king if he had a queen. Father Christmas is Merlin et al after all, and therefore the so-called dyslexicdevil worshipper who “sold his soul to Santa” was also not so stupid. In earlierdepictions he also represents Old Father Time, Saturn or Chronos, the father ofthe Titans. In this guise he is Iapetus or Anu. Merlin and Odin were theinspiration for Tolkein's wizard Gandalf or Gand-Aelf, meaning “Grey ElfSorcerer” in Norse. Odin wore a dark blue hood (Robin!) and a grey mantle. HenceTolkein's Gandalf the Grey, and Od-in or Hood-en. Robin or Robert means BrightFlame, which appears to be linked more or less to Lucifer. Here we return to theconcept of the Wild Hunt. Chronos ate his kin (his children). Hearne (Oberon/Alberich) or Odin was Master of the Wild Hunt for Elf women (also his kin) whomhe also “ate”. In France one name for the Devil, the God of the Witches, wasAlbirin—which obviously is Oberon, king of Elves. The French had a separate, Frankish, Robin Hood and Maid Marian (seeJ. Hunt) who were probably derived from a common early Gallic cultic root. It is from this tradition, one might assert, that Robert III inherited his roleas the Robin Hood-en, or Odin, The Hooded Wanderer. One can see Raymond and Melusine echoed in Robin and Marian even though thelatter fit variously the Jesus and Magdalene, Arthur and Guinevere cycle moreeasily. Robin and Arthur have a number of identical Celtic adventures. This doesnot apply to Raymond, but five elements seem to bind their cycles together. 1) Raymond kills Aymeri, Mordred kills Arthur. (Chronos cycle)2) Guinevere deserts Arthur, Melusine deserts Raymond. (Lohengrin cycle)3) Jesus and Robin are both betrayed and killed. (Priest King cycle)4) Robin and Arthur are betrayed by women. (The Abbess and Morgana)5) Melusine betrays and also kills her father. It is arguable that these tales were enshrined in Druidic lore in the firstplace, because in reality they happened all too often. At least they happenedoften enough, perhaps, for the Druids to recognise that these events followedarchetypal and repetitive, psychologically ingrained patterns, like treadmills.Some of them needed addressing and avoiding, for the good of the kingdom and thepeople. Addenda1) In a delightful little children's book entitled Hamish aud the Fairy Gifts,by a Scot named Moira Miller, I noticed a repetition of the red hair business: A couple has a red-haired son, newly born, and the grandmother wants to takeprecautions against his possible abduction by the Sidhe because he has hairwhich is “The Kings’ Colour”, the very thing they (the Sidhe) prize most”.Precautions are ignored by the couple and they notice one morning that theirchild's eyes have changed from blue to green, though he still has hair of theKings’ Colour. The child is of course a changeling. What is interesting is her comment about the child's hair being the colour ofkingship. Again we have an assertion, found often before and elsewhere, in astory obviously derived from Scottish folk sources—that Sidhe hair is red andtheir eye colour is green, with the added element that this is also thepigmentation of Kings. Therefore, if Red is the Fairy colour and also the Royalcolour, the two are the same. Here we go back to red-haired Lilith and theAnunnaki, who are the original source of kingship. One will notice in themedieval pictorial ensemble of “Melusine by the fountain” that she too hasred-gold hair. In a variant of one of her tales related by Baring-Gould, herfirst son (Milo) has one red eye and one green, as opposed to blue in the otherstory we began with. In Serbia, red hair is the mark of the Vampire. 2) From: Frozen Tombs of the Scythians, by M. I. Artamonov: Scientific American,page 238. All the corpses had had their heads partly or entirely shaved butbefore their burial, hair had been attached artificially to the heads of thewomen and beards to the faces of the men. 3) From: Research on Lilith. Page 13, under Zohar l :54b-55a, a quote from R.Yitzhaq. “Female spirits come and play with him (man) and get hot [C] from himand thereafter bear [those demons] which are called the Plagues of Mankind. Andthey turn into likenesses of men but have no hair on their head.” (Patai 81:471) This is directly related to the Liliths and their brothers, the Lilin, who arethose from the North. Lilith is the alien crown, the northern queen. (Patai81:453) One is reminded of the habit of the Egyptian Priests who also shavedtheir heads. However, in this case I believe that it refers specifically to theScythians. The reader might recall some excerpts from Dr. Miranda Green's compilation, TheCeltic World. In this work it suggests that in Celtic Europe, corpses weresometimes dismembered in order to prevent the soul of the departed from passingover to Tir Na Nog, the Otherworld. This explains the thinking behind theconcept of Portal Guardians and therefore, the reason why Dracula's headlessbody was buried under the entrance of the Chapel, etc. It also explains why theScythian corpses had their hair glued back on, post mortem. Although certain of the castes would perhaps have shaved their heads duringlife, perhaps leaving a plaited pony tail at the crown, in the style adopted bythe Chinese, would have been considered incomplete if some attempt at replacingthe hair had not been undertaken. Being incomplete, they would have been tied tothe this world, unable to make the transition from death to rebirth. This beliefpossibly originates from a root Indo-Aryan belief that is also shared by theHindus. During the Raj period in India, the greatest punishment that could beinflicted upon a Hindu was to be strapped to the muzzle of a cannon and have thelimbs and vitals blown to kingdom come. Presumably, it would have beenimpossible to completely reconstitute the shattered-and-splattered remains ofthe recidivist. We are aware of the tradition of Ring Hoards, Oath Rings and Rings of Power, andtheir symbolic role in the Dragon Myth as a version of the Grail in talesranging as far and wide as Mesopotamia, Tibet, Scandinavia, tribal Africa (TheNaga people) and Japan. The ring in Zen is Zero, the Eternal Now, the Gateway toElphame and so on. We also know that Charlemagne was given a magical ring by aDragon on the occasion of his “magical” wedding to an unknown eastern FairyPrincess called Frastrada. As Oroborous, the Dragon is the Ring. Charlemagne's ring eventually found its way into a mere, thanks to BishopTurpin. Water is the female element, and therefore all Fairy Maidens are typesof Melusine. It could be argued that the involvement of the Dragon suggests thatthis marriage was also an alchemical wedding or hierogamy, in the tradition ofCourtly Love. Here yet again is the basic story of sovereignty. It is achievedthrough transcendence, via the union of the king to a Mere Maid, a “portalguardian” who allows the King participation in the Otherworld or Eternity which,in this story, as in the story of Odin and his sovereignty of the nine worlds,is symbolised by the Ring. The Ring of Power is necessarily the Ring of Love,because that Love bestows Transcendence or Wisdom, the proper exercising ofwhich, affords power. "},{"pageContent":"[images/00004.jpg]Chapter 41 The Dragon Sovereignty The ring as a symbol of kingship originated with Enki (Samael) or Satan, as theChurch would have us call him. Samael was the earlier name for Prometheus andLoki, whom the Zeus prototype vowed would remain chained to the White Mountainforever. After some time Zeus regretted his vow and wished to releasePrometheus, but was bound by his word not to do so. At last a compromise wasreached and Zeus tore the chains which bound Prometheus. From one link ofadamantine he forged a ring and set upon it a stone cut from the mountain. Inthis way he was able to keep his word, that his old adversary would forever bebound to the mountain, but afforded at the same time his release. The mythical conflict between the Grecian Zeus and Prometheus originated inScythia. There the two gods were named Enki (Samael) and Enlil (Jehovah). Thewar between them arose firstly as a dispute over seniority. They were the sonsof one father, Anu. Enki was the younger son of Anu's senior wife, Antu. Enlilwas the elder of the two sons but was born to Anu's second or junior wife, Ki.In Anunnaki culture the female was the source of sovereignty and by rights Enkior Samael (Satan) was therefore the rightful heir to his father, Anu, King ofthe Anunnaki or gods. Enlil disputed this claim and furthermore resented Enki'spatronage and assistance of mankind, whom Enlil (Jehovah-Zeus) hated and wishedconstantly to destroy. This story is repeated in the Greek tale of Zeus' hatred of mankind and the warfor supremacy and control of man waged between the elder gods, the Titans, ledby Prometheus, and the younger gods, the Olympians, led by Zeus. It is repeated again in the tale of the war between Satan and Jehovah. In allthese stories, it is the son of the elder queen who is the rightful heir, andthis is Enki-Samael-Prometheus-Satan, the friend, saviour and supporter ofmankind. Enlil or Zeus-Jehovah further objected to the idea of investing in man the rightto kingship and self rule, as this was, by tradition, the sole prerequisite ofthe Anunnaki alone. A compromise was reached in the Dragon Council, and it wasdecided that an Anunnaki queen would incubate a human ovum fertilised by Enki orSamael-Satan. The resulting child would be the first king or queen of the raceof men, being mostly Anunnaki. Several attempts were made at producing asuitable child by adopting varying permutations of the Anunnaki-humaninteraction. Samael inseminated an Eljo woman, resulting in the birth of Adam,the first prototype of mortal kingship. The second experiment was between Enki-Samael and Eve, his daughter. The childthey produced was called Cain, who was mated to Lilith Luluwa, the pure-bredAnunnaki daughter of Lilith the Beautiful and Samael. To Lilith Luluwa, Cain andtheir sacred offspring was given, via Nm Kursag, the Tiara of Dragon (notmortal) Kingship from the hand of their father Enki-Samael, the rightfuloverlord of the Gods, whilst Adam and his children were still considered byEnlil to be serfs. However, upon them the usurping Enlil conveyed his ownkingship without the authority of the Council of the Dragon Gods, the Anunnaki.This he did in an attempt to gain support from humanity for his illegitimateclaim to leadership of the Council. In a later rendering of the story of the origin of kingship, which accompaniesthe story of the war between the rightful gods, the Titans, and their youngerrivals, it is said that rings became the symbol of kingship. They wereapparently worn in memory of Prometheus, from whom all true kings weredescended. These rings of alchemical or magical priest-kingship are specificallyDragon Rings, which are symbolised by the alchemical Oroborous, the Serpent orDragon eating its own tail, the 0 or Zero. Prometheus the Titan is the “elder god”. He is Enki, later called Satan.Therefore the two stories, originating from a common source, attest to the ideathat the holy, Draconian, Otherworldly origin of the blood of kings ultimatelyderives from Satan or Samael-Enki, and Lilith. It does not come from theirrival, the usurper Jehovah-Zeus or Enlil, and the race of Adam from whom isderived the origin of the later Tinker Kings, the false monarchies that arebased, not on service and transcendent wisdom, but on worldly greed, tyranny,trade and usury. The bloodline of Lilith and Samael, the pure royal blood of true kingshipdescended, therefore, from Transylvania and Mesopotamia, through the Sobekhqueens of Egypt who, after the Anunnaki, established the first Royal DragonCourt. From that point it devolved down to the Tuatha de Danaan of Eire andtheir descendants, the Pictish, Dragon, Fairy princesses of the Holy Grail,whose families colonised Caledonia and Anjou. Such was the strength and purity of this ancient bloodline, that it was neverforcefully assimilated, interbred or conquered. Through the Tuatha de Danaan andtheir daughters and sons, the Pictish Dragon queens and kings, the Elven ladiesand lords of the British Isles, the Royal Dragon blood devolved to the ancientVere-Bruidhe, the priest-kings of the Calle Daouine in 400 BC. This lineagedescended through the centuries to the arch-Druidic, Pictish Priestess-QueenBruidhina who married King Gille Sidhean of Albany, an eighth-century descendantof the Druidic, sacral house of the Ulidian of the Ver Bolg. Taking her Elvenentourage—her Royal Dragon Court—with her, their daughter, the Fairy PrincessMaelasanu de Scythes or Sidhe, the second niece-granddaughter of Morgan la Fey,moved from Scotland to France. There she married another Vere, the Frankishprince of Gallic Pictavia, Raymond de Forez, through whom she continued, in theearly eighth century, the first Royal House of Vere of Anjou or Anschau, meaning“mystical revelation”. Their eldest son, Prince Maelus or Milo de Vere, Duke of Angers, became thesecond Prince-Comte of Anjou, after his father. From him the ancient RoyalDragon blood, the mystical lineage of Vere of the first royal house of Anjou,continued to descend for another 1300 years to the present day, in an unbroken,single named, senior dynastic line of Royal Dragon princesses and princes. Inthe 19th century, Baron Thomas Macauley wrote of them that they were the mostancient, most noble and most prestigious family in Britain, and indeed in Europeas a whole. In Jewelled Torrents fell the Midyear's light as playfully into the eagerlyawaiting mere, it Swirled below the mountain ridge. Dark then the waters layin that shaded forest pool Which concealed forever themournful Mystery, lying beneath its bridge. To the Northern Star; the Yearning currents cascaded forth, to Wed the crystalleaded tumult Of the Druid Healer's Flow. Embracing, these Undines wandered the Summer's Lands, below the bridge Of theFord's High Cross, Behind the Boar's wide brow. The Dragon's Power; the ancient Sovereignty of an Ancient Fairy King laid there,hatefully torn From his heart; ere Broken. A Maiden Fair and Fey, The Dragon Queen must be, Who astrideRhiannon rides in Quest for Love's Last Token. "},{"pageContent":"Appendix 1 The Biological Basis of Elitism and “Divine Right” Ruleby Tracy R. Twyman Originally published in Paranoia magazine On October 28th, 1998, a number of newspapers across the country ran anAssociated Press article entitled “Presidential Hopefuls Share Blue BloodLines.” The article, based on information put forth by Burke’s Peerage, claimsthat every single President of the United States has had a notable amount ofroyal European ancestry, and in each Presidential race, the one with the mostroyal genes is the one who wins—every single time. This tendency has been notedin supposedly Democratic European politics as well, prompting some to chargethat a global conspiracy exists to keep power within the hands of a specificgene pool. This charge is not entirely baseless, and many books have beenwritten tracing modern aristocratic bloodlines back to the royal houses ofIsrael, Egypt, Sumer, and beyond. The charge is further supported by the factthat many of the supposed conspirators proudly boast about the ancient originsof their ancestry. The traditional explanation for why power is passed downthrough the ages by blood has been the mystical Divine Right of Kings. Thisdates back to the 17th century and states that a king is created by God, andtherefore kingly authority resides in the blood irrespective of anything else.Many have claimed that there is a genetic characteristic carried in the blooditself which makes this so. But what would it be? Is there a legitimatephysiological reason behind the Divine Right of Kings? Fields of the NephilimThe all-important element of the Divine Right is that it comes from God, oralternatively, “the gods”. And who were these gods? Authors such as ZechariaSitchin, Sir Laurence Gardner and Nicholas de Vere are authoritatively convincedthat kingship was created by an advanced race of beings called the Annunaki,also called the Nephilim in the Old Testament. They reportedly civilized thehuman race and interbred with a portion of it to create the kingly caste whichuntil this day has maintained control over the Earth. These celestial creatureshave been variously identified with Dragons, Elves, Fairies, Gnomes,Leprechauns, Sprites, Nymphs, Pixies, Angels, Demons, Devils, Witches, Giants,Vampires, Werewolves, and just about every mythical being you can imagine. Some, like Gardner and Sitchin, claim that they come from another planet. Otherssay that they’re from the Hollow Earth. Some, like David Icke, say that they arehumans inhabited by the spirits of multidimensional reptiles, capable ofshapeshifting into reptile form at any time. Still others claim that they werehumanoid, but more than human, with pale white skin. The human hybrid offspringthat they created as the Royal/Priestly caste was, according to most, theAryans, who usually had red hair with green eyes—in stark contrast to thetraditional Hitlerian vision. Nicholas de Vere, the leader of an organization called the Dragon Court whichclaims to represent this royal Aryan caste, writes, “the depiction of the Aryan(Scythian) as a tall, ruddy-complexioned blonde racist yeomanfarmer-warrior-godhas no basis in truth.” He further suggests that the “yeoman-farmer” Celtic,Gaulish and Pictish tribes which we now think of as Aryan were actually of adifferent race, but had hired the extra-human Aryans to be their leaders. These Aryans were also the masterminds behind the Indian, Hittite, Greek,Egyptian, Hebrew, Sumerian and Pre-Sumerian Ubaid civilizations. Some believethat their descendants can be found amongst the segment of the population withthe RH Negative blood type, roughly 5% of the Earth’s population, most of themEuropeans. These people are often born with an extra vertebrate, have a lowerthan normal body temperature, and can rarely mate with one another successfully,suggesting that they may indeed be a hybrid species. Conspiracy enthusiastArizona Wilder takes it a step further saying, “The Aryan bloodline is alien tothis planet... There are 13 bloodlines from this kind of stock (the Merovingiansbeing one), and all of them have to a greater or lesser degree the capacity toplay host to the Shape Changer reptiles.” The other 12 families have beenidentified as Astor, Bundy, Collins, Dupont, Freeman, Kennedy, Li, Onassis,Reynolds, Rockefeller, Rothschild, Russell, and Van Duyn, with the rest—theEuropean royal families—being categorized as “Merovingian.” These are the peoplereferred to by the fanatic group the Sons of Jared when they “pledge animplacable war against the descendants of the Watchers, who as notoriouspharaohs, kings and dictators, have throughout history dominated mankind... likesuper-gangsters, a celestial Mafia ruling the world.” The Book of Enoch saysthat the sons of the Nefilim are destined to “afflict, oppress, destroy, attack,do battle and work destruction on the earth.” Nicholas de Vere, himself a prince of the “Dragon blood”, sees it quitedifferently. He sees them as the rightful shepherds of the human flock. “TheFairies were tuned to a higher frequency of perception and activity generally.In the past, therefore, because the Fairies were, for millennia, physiologicallybred and exhaustively trained to operate at a higher level than men, humansoften invited them to become social navigators... A Dragon was one who sawclearly, and the clarity of vision engendered was always classically associatedwith wisdom, which itself produces power....” The Annunaki and their quasi-human offspring are attributed with remarkabletraits. They lived for thousands of years, were capable of levitation,dimension-hopping, clairvoyance, and a million other magical powers, all aproduct of applied eugenics. “Selective unions gave the race the opportunity tobreed outstanding magicians whose gift of natural perception and understanding:and whose ability to access the “Otherworld”, helped to produce and guidebrilliant kings who ruled with elegant aplomb. The ability to perform magic wascarried in the blood” and “the Elves were relied upon by their client races tobe able to see things and perform feats that these client races couldn’t.” Laurence Gardner, himself a former member of the Dragon Court, concurs. “Inshort, these people were bred to be leaders of mankind, and they were bothmentally and physically maintained in the highward state.” But what property didthey inherit in the blood which makes this possible? Those who have written onthis subject are nearly unanimous about the fact that the answer isendocrinology. Says de Vere, “hormonal levels [are] influenced by geneticinheritance and hormones [affect] the individual’s perceptions, psychologicalunicameralism and the subsequent ability to transcend and perceive theintricacies of the cosmos. Elven blood [is] rich in these substances.” Starfire Bloodfests“The best blood is of the moon, monthly...”Aleister Crowley, The Book of the Law. The beneficial effects of the hormone melatonin have been part of the healthsupplement scene for some time. High melatonin production is known to besynonymous with a high immune system, a low cancer risk, long life, energy,stamina, and according to many, enhanced spiritual awareness. Perhaps it isfitting then that this hormone is secreted by the pineal gland, a mysteriouslittle item long believed by mystics to be the “Seat of the Soul”, “the ThirdEye”, and the organ through which psychic powers are exercised. In fact itactually functions as an organ of sight in some reptiles, and it still seems topossess some sensitivity to light in higher mammals, as melatonin productionincreases when the person is exposed to darkness. Thus melatonin means “nightworker.” Writes Laurence Gardner, “High melatonin production thereby increasesthe facility for receiving and transmitting high-frequency cosmic and localbroadcasts, and leads to a greater state of cosmic awareness—a state simply of“knowing.” In this regard, it is interesting to note that the Pineal Third Eyehas been found to contain very fine granular particles, rather like the crystalsin a wireless receiving set.” Many magical rites and meditation techniques areaimed at gaining control of this organ and the fluid it produces, the livemelatonin. Rumor has it that the members of the super-secret society Skull &Bones, to which both George Bush Sr. and George W. Bush belong, engage in aceremony called “The Obscene Rite”. This involves the consumption of the livepineal gland of a human or animal sacrifice in order to get the freshsecretions. Supplements bought over the counter are ineffective because, asGardner explains, “their inherent secretions are obtained from the desiccatedglands of dead animals and they lack the truly important elements which onlyexist in live human glandular manufacture.” But the Aryan overlords who ruled over mankind in ancient days had a simpler wayof acquiring this fluid. Their ancestor-gods, the Annunaki, had endocrinesystems that produced large amounts of this and other beneficial substances.Therefore they drank it straight from the source: the menstrual blood andvaginal fluids of the goddesses themselves. This they referred to, lovingly, as“Starfire” and drank in a ritual ceremony called the Black Mass, after which theCatholic Mass is said to have been modeled. Later, as direct contact with theAnnunaki ceased, the fluids were collected from sacred priestesses referred toas “Scarlet Women”, or “Grail Maidens.” You may recognize the Scarlet Woman asthe Whore of Revelations, as well as the title which Aleister Crowley gave toall of his sex magick partners. “These sacred, royal princesses,”, writes deVere, “virgins of High Birth and Pure Blood, at an optimum age would be chosento act as feeding females”. Their essences contained such valuable substancesas, “oxytocin, prolactin, melatonin, seratonin, adenosine triphosphate,dopamine, telomerase, and retinol.” There is another important ingredient in themix here. De Vere explains that, “many think that only men have semen when infact women also have it.” And so a Starfire ritual involves the use of a goldenstraw. “Such a device would have been inserted into the virgin's urethra to thedepth of about one inch, whilst the partner in the rite inserted his or herfinger into the vagina and massaged the “roof of the mouth” or uppermost wall ofthe cannel nearest the opening of the vagina, behind the public bone. After afew conducive moments perhaps, orgasm would occur and the fluid from the glandwould discharge itself through the straw, either into the waiting mouth of therecipient, or onto a “grail platter” or dish held next to the vulva.” Keenreaders will recognize this as being identical to a sex magick ritual advocatedby Aleister Crowley for members of his “Order of Oriental Templars” (OTO). Theonly difference is that his rite also involved the use of male semen which wascalled the “Red Tincture” or “coagulated blood”, while the female fluids werecalled “Gluten” or “The White Tincture.” Together they made “The Elixir ofLife”, and in alchemy blood and semen are the primae materia or first matter ofthe Great Work. “This is the true Key to Magick”, writes Crowley. “That is, bythe right use of this secret, man may impose his Will on Nature herself.” Monatomic Gold: The SubstituteBut according to de Vere and others, ingesting the fluids of mundane women hasonly a slight effect, certainly not enough to maintain the members of a RoyalDragon family in the manner to which they are accustomed. And after a fewthousand years, the genetic purity of their Grail maidens began to deteriorate,so the Starfire lost its potency. This reportedly began around 1960 BC and isequated with the time that an edict was handed down to Noah by God demandingthat the consumption of all blood cease immediately. (Genesis 9:4) Thus, asubstitute had to be found, and so the alchemical process was created, as ameans of artificially creating the Elixir of Life, the Philosopher’s Stone, alsoknown as “potable gold.” This is achieved using a black powder known asoccultum, the universal solvent which has the power to transmute metals. Whenplaced against gold it converted it into a white powder which could be ingested.It is said to cause nothing less than immortality, as it sets off aself-correcting mechanism in one’s DNA that lasts for thousands of years. Italso bestows the enhanced melatonin production and magical powers associatedwith Starfire, including clairvoyance, dimension-hopping and flyingcapabilities. It is believed that this “white gold” is the same as the“shew-bread” and “manna from Heaven” mentioned in the Old Testament. Today, there are those who publicly proclaim knowledge of the Philosopher’sStone. A man named David Hudson claims to have created a technique formanufacturing this white gold, which he’s pattented as ORME (OrbitallyRearranged Monatomic Elements.) Ormus is a name associated with the Holy Grail,and so readers may not be surprised to learn that Hudson himself is related tothe Merovingian Grail family, through Claude de Guise. Basically, the powder iscreated by putting gold into a higher atomic state through a series of intenseheating and cooling sessions, during which it loses and gains weight radically,as though portions of the mass were being transferred into another dimension.David Hudson continues about the magical quantum properties of his white gold: These M-state elements have been observed to exhibit superconductivity,superfluidity, Josephson tunneling and magnetic levitation... They may enhanceenergy flow in the microtubules inside every living cell. Ingesting M-state goldhas different effects on the body than the effects of ingesting metallic gold.At 2 mg. it totally has gotten rid of Karposi Sarcomas in AIDS patients. Within2 hours, their white blood cell count goes from 2500 to 6500. ... Stage 4 cancerpatients have taken it orally, and after 45 days have no cancer left anyplace inthe body. It’s been used on Lou Gehrig’s disease, it’s been used on MS, it’sbeen used on MD, it’s been used on arthritis. It literally corrects the DNA. Sympathy for the DevilAll of this puts a nice, friendly face on the whole thing, a secret power heldonly by an elite caste of Aryans who use it to lord themselves over the rest ofthe human population. And there are those who would say that the “substitute”white gold never did away with the original practice of blooddrinking as amethod for obtaining the substances needed. David Icke and his associate, Arizona Wilder, have campaigned the globe toinform its citizens with Chicken Little-like hysteria that most of itsfinanciers, politicians and aristocrats are actually under the control ofReptilian beings from another dimension, who are inhabiting their bodies. “Tohold their human form, these entities need to drink human (mammalian) blood andaccess the energy it contains to maintain their DNA codes in their “human”expression. If they don't, they manifest their reptilian codes and we would allsee what they really look like.” Icke believes that most of this blood isobtained in human sacrifice rituals engaged in by the Satanic Illuminati. “Fromwhat I understand from former “insiders”, the blood (energy) of babies and smallchildren is the most effective for this, as are blond-haired, blue-eyed people.Hence these are the ones overwhelmingly used in sacrifice, as are red-hairedpeople also.” His compatriot, Arizona Wilder goes into a bit more detail whenshe writes, “They have a hypnotic gaze which fixes the victim—in a trance ofterror—which promotes secretion of the pineal gland—at that point, they cannothold human form any longer and begin to shapeshift in anticipation of supper.” Wilder claims to have witnessed Laurence Gardner drinking blood andshapeshifting during a sacrifice at Montauk, New York. Wilder also claims tohave seen a number of others who were transformed during similar bloodfests,including, “...Bush and his two sons, Albright, Kissinger, Reagan and Nancy, J.Rockefeller, Ford, Carter and LB Johnson, the Queen Mother, Queen Elizabeth II,Princess Margaret, Charles, Tony Blair, Prince Philip, and Zecharia Sitchin.”She acknowledges that Starfire rituals go on as well. “In the underground vaultsof his castle in the Alsace Region of France, green glowing fluorescent rocksturn stored menstrual blood black to be used at that special ritual. All membersof the British House apparently have jewelencrusted goblets with which to drinkthe blood from the symbolic female grail and a symbolic dagger to give it a bitof a stir. Some Spencers were at these rituals, but Diana would not attend...the smell of Diana’s periods would have caused Charles to shapeshift—especiallywhilst sleeping, because the reptiles cannot retain their human form withoutconcentration.” This may shed new light on Prince Charles’ reported desire tobecome a tampon. Aware of these charges, Laurence Gardner and Nicholas de Vere have tried toclear the record. They’ve acknowledged that vampirism does take place at theirrituals, but maintain that they only drink the blood of their own familymembers, who participate willingly. “You cannot take the essences by force, theyare only given in love”, writes de Vere. “Otherwise their systems will react byproducing chemicals during one’s assault upon them that will completely knockout the chemicals traditionally required.” He claims that vampirism wasoriginally the purview of a few noble families who practiced it in order tomaintain their powers. “The most famous stories”, writes de Vere, “those ofDracula, Bathory and de Rais, support this conclusion.” He and Gardnerenthusiastically embrace Dracula as one of their own. “This Sacred Prince, aHermetic scholar and initiate, a student of magic, a Magus, Witch Lord andDragon Prince, counterbalanced the bloodlust of his forebears with a refinedknowledge and advanced practice of Grail procedure”, writes De Vere. Dracula wasa member of Sigismund’s Dragon Court in Hungary, and therefore of the Grailblood. He also attended a Hermetic academy called the Austrian School ofSolomon. “The orthodox establishment’s fear of Dracula,” writes Gardner, “wasnot his treatment of enemies but his in-depth knowledge of alchemy, kingship andthe ancient Starfire customs.” As for the claim that they use these rituals toconjure up Dragon ancestors from another dimension, de Vere calmly admits thatthis is the case, and that the participants have their bodies taken over bythese spirits, who “rise from the dead to take possession of the Witch’s soul.”He further explains that, “Any spirit, including the archangels, conjured by theWitch or magician was actually the ancestor of the Witch. ...It was carried inthe Witch’s blood which, the purer it was through the unbroken descent from theDragons, the stronger would be the return from the ancestors within. In otherwords, they brought together and spoke or gesticulated a series of mnemonicsthat would trigger off precontrived, imprinted states of consciousness thatacted as doorways into deeper seats of consciousness.” The charge of Satanism is not entirely refuted either, but de Vere proffers thatthey are not worshipping Satan so much as honoring one of their forefathers whomthey stick right in the family tree along with Jesus, Davidand the rest. “TheSabbatical Goat of the Black Mass was Chem-Zoroaster,”, he writes, “one of theearly ancestors of the ancient Dragon Families,” and, “Satan was also called bythe Witches “Christ, son Dei”. ...Jesus’ heredity and the descent of the Druidicdynasties...was devilish, because the descent of both bloodlines was from theSumerian Enki who was the Akkadian Samael, the Roman Lucifer, and thus theCatholic Satan.” But the Dragon Court members make no apology for this, because,“To any intelligent person, to any true seer, concepts like white or black magicor good and evil are irrational, childish nonsense; both in terms of logic andactual fact.” Every Elf For Himself“This is our Law, and the Law of the Strong.”—Crowley, ibid. To the charges of “conspiring to take over the world”, the Dragons deny thatthey give two licks what the rest of humanity does with itself. Their primaryconcern is, according to de Vere, “the restoration of their own Tribes, theirown Nation and their own Homelands.... the foundation of their own distinctsociety...re-introducing their old social structures and values.” This resultsin “The Grail Code”, a system of Egalitarian, Chivalric ethics that governs howDragons treat other members of their race. However, “it is not the code thatefficiently orders the behaviour of the Dragon families in their dealings withthose not of the Grail blood.” They acknowledge and defend their own elitistattitudes towards mankind, whom they regard as, according to de Vere,“thoroughly stupid and dim-witted, with a clear indication that this conditionis genetically inherited.” Whereas in contrast, “The Elves were naturallytranscendent of spirit and their queens and kings were insulated from the commonround of nuisances and petty concerns by minds which were bred for deepermatters.” Despite their hatred of humanity, they will kindly agree to be theguardians of our governments again (if they aren’t secretly doing so already),should the population choose to accept them, and offer them the thrones of theEarth, which de Vere and friends indicate are rightfully theirs anyway. They arejust waiting for mankind to realize it again. Whether we choose to or not, we will have to deal with the fact that these“Elves” seem to be in possession of a material that bestows long life as well asfantastic physical, mental, and spiritual powers. This gives them a distinctadvantage which they are clearly attempting to hold over us, while they allowour populations to wallow in disease, death, and spiritual degradation. As anexcuse, de Vere and Gardner state that the Starfire and white gold are onlyeffective for those already of the Dragon blood anyway, because the rest of thepeople, “won’t have the right blood serum or the right connections in theircerebral lobes.” De Vere denies the claims of most people who believe themselvesto be of this bloodline. “Some people argue that because of the outbreeding ofthe old families, there must be millions of people “of the Fairy blood” livingtoday: but such a statement flies in the face of accepted fact of history. Thegenuine old royal families rarely outbred at all, whilst the later, fakeparvenu, tinker nobility whom people now confuse with them often did.” So that leaves little hope for Joe Sixpack of ever obtaining the fruits of thismagnificent “Philosopher’s Stone”, which “gives youth to the old” and isdescribed as, “The summation of the heart’s desire.” But if such a substancewere available to the public, how much would it cost? Would it be obtainable byeveryone, or only the rich and privileged? What if it could be administered forfree in the water supply, or was available in tablet form at your localpharmacy, covered by your health insurance policy? What would happen to ouralready exploding population?

Hearts remote, yet not asunder;Distance and no space was seen‘Twixt this Turtle and his queen:But in them it were a wonder. So between them love did shineThat the Turtle saw his rightFlaming in the Phoenix’ sight:Either was the other’s mine. Property was thus appalledThat the self was not the same;Single nature’s double nameNeither two nor one was called. Reason, in itself confounded,Saw division grow together,To themselves yet either neither,Simple were so well compounded; That it cried, “How true a twainSeemeth this concordant one!Love has reason, reason none,If what parts can so remain.” Whereupon it made this threneTo the Phoenix and the Dove,Co-supremes and stars of love,As chorus to their tragic scene: THRENOS Beauty, truth, and rarity,Grace in all simplicity,Here enclos’d in cinders lie. Death is now the Phoenix’ nest,And the Turtle’s loyal breastTo eternity doth rest, Leaving no posterity:‘Twas not their infirmity,It was married chastity. Truth may seem but cannot be;Beauty brag but ‘tis not she;Truth and beauty buried be. To this urn let those repairThat are either true or fair;For these dead birds sigh a prayer.
