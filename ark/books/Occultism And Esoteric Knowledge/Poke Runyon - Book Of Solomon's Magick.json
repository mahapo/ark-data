[{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":".9l.6out the .9!uthor: Carroll \"Poke\" Runyon describes himself as \"A Gentleman of The Old School\" which he defines as, \"One who recites classical poetry to heartless beauties while wrestling alligators.\" He has lived out his Neo-Romantic philos- ophy as a Captain in the Green Berets, a student of Ninjutsu, a blue-water sailor, a scuba-diver, an internationally published novelist and author of adven- ture stories in the legendary ARGOSY magazine. For more than thirty years he has been a leading figure in the revival of ceremonial magick as Western civi- lization's spiritual counterpart to Eastern mysticism and native American shamanism. His background in occult study and practice is extensive: in 1970 he became the founder-magister of the Ordo Templi Astartes, which is now America's oldest continually operating ritual magick lodge. In 1980 Runyon received his Master's Degree in cultural anthropology from California State University at Northridge, specializing in magick. After graduate school he took all the degrees of Freemasonry in both the Scottish and York Rites. He then undertook an intense series of Tibetan tantric initiations and training sessions under the direction of H.E. Luding Khen Rinpoche of the Sakya Order, mastering the Vajra Yogini (Goddess of the Sorcerers) system. Runyon later received the Kalachakra initiation from H.H. The Dalai Lama. His articles on Magick and the Western Tradition have appeared in Gnostica magazine and his Church's journal, The Seventh Ray. Runyon's most noted contribution to the post W.W. IT occult revival has been his redis- covery and subsequent development of the facial reflection/distortion dark mirror skrying method for magical evocation. In 1974 he appeared as a guest on the Tom Snyder t.v. show, narrating film footage of O.T.A. magical opera- tions. Through his Church (The Church of the Hermetic Sciences, Inc.), Runyon has written, produced and narrated a video entitled: The Magick of Solomon that dramatically demonstrates the unique and powerful spiritual development system described in The Book of Solomon's Magick. Most recently he has produced a video documentary of an actual Goetic magical operation, Dark Mirror of Magick, with remarkable prophetic results in our troubled times."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Jiow to Invo~ f4.ngefs into the Crusta! ana T,voR!- Spirits to o/isibfe f4.ppearance in the Dark; Mirror by ~Q!JOQ~QI) D[}~Q Silverado, California"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"\\ \\ I I i ---= ~ -=- - - - - ~ 1 · J @ 1.~B5 C.H.: •• :~c ."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"q'a6fe of Contents Pronouncement 1.

I learned how to summon the seventy-two spirits of King Solomon's legendary Brass Vessel to visible appearance in the Dark Mirror on the Triangle of Art. This book, and our accompanying video, THE MAGICK OF SOLOMON, demonstrate and properly teach this secret method for the first time. Inspired by the rediscovery of this GOETIC method of practice, I was further enabled to recover the technique of Angelic Crystal Invocation from the ancient book ALMADEL. I was then led to rectify this essen- tial LEMEGETON sub-system with the seventy-two Angels of the SHEMHAMEPHORASH and link them to their seventy-two demonic counterparts in the GOETIA. This produced a spiritually balanced, the- oretically elegant and astrologically coordinated scheme of practice that was compatible with modem theories of Jungian psychology. Students who have struggled for years to visualize these entities and to make sense of the confused and even contradictory instructions in the LEMEGETON will be delighted to finally discover operative methods that really work within a theoretical framework that emulates the impeccable celestial models of the Renaissance magi.

Introduction: T HIS IS A THEORETICAL AND PRACTICAL handbook of Ceremonial Magick that is different from any you've ever read. The magick this book teaches was reconstructed and rectified from authentic ancient sources, re-interpreted in modem psy- chological terms and brought to life by powerful hypnotic techniques. This system was developed by and for imaginative people who are not natural psychics. I have written The Book of Solomon ~ Magick for those special individuals in the broader Neo-Romantic Community who seek the ultimate spiritual-intellectual adventure. If you have ever yearned to be a wizard or an enchantress in the grand old medieval/Renaissance tradition, but were put-off by the bric-a-brac of \"Victorian Occultism\" while finding yourself underwhelmed by the 2"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"current Neo-Pagan and New Age alternatives, then this is the book for you. I. This book - and our accompanying video, The Magick of Solomon - will show you how to invoke Holy Angels and then sum- mon ancient Goddesses, Gods, Fallen Angels and even hell-bound demons to visible appearance. You will be in direct communication with these mighty beings. The methods I will teach you are absolute- ly authentic and remarkably effective. Before we go any further I want to make two things very clear: first, I am not going insult your intelligence by providing you with an over-simplified \"cook book\" filled with nothing but training exercises, skrying techniques and warmed-over rituals culled from 19th century sources. Certainly the training exercises for our special invocation & evocation methods, the rituals, the practical information and the ref- erences you will need are all here - but I am also giving you the his- tory, the philosophy and the theory behind this powerful system. There are some forms of shamanism where the practitioner is permitted to be, or even expected to be, illiterate. Our tradition is quite the opposite. A Western magus or, if this term seems too mascu- line for female readers, an enchantress, is expected to be a person of knowledge (to paraphrase Carlos Castenada), at least in his or her own field. Remember that our mythological avatar, King Solomon, was noted for his wisdom. With that in mind I sincerely hope that you will find the back- ground material I've presented on Carl Jung's theories, Hermetic phi- losophy, Kabbalah, hypnosis and yoga to be too condensed and obvi- ously introductory. You are expected to consult the works I have rec- ommended in the study guide. Don't let anyone tell you that you don't need this knowledge to be a Western magician. You do! You may also contact me directly. In fact if you are going to seriously pursue this system, I definitely want to hear from you. 3"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"Now that we are clear on that there is one other thing I must warn you about before you begin. If you successfully complete this program you will not be the same person you were when you started. Once you have experienced these wonders you may return to the medi- ocrity of everyday life but your mind and soul will range in realms beyond. You will be transformed forever into one of The Far-seeing People. 2. You may never be able to share what you know with those you love and you may not even wish to. Solomon's Magick opens a door into the starry gulfs of eternity. Once you have passed through that door, and it closes behind you, there is no going back. We might say that the ordinary person knows only the short span from birth to death while the Magus understands that this life adds one more skull to a necklace that must eventually be valued like a jeweler would appraise a string of pearls. There are very few people who would be willing to pay the price I paid to learn these ancient, secret methods. In 1969 I nearly lost my life and my sanity discovering and perfecting these techniques. I am one of a handful of practicing and teaching magicians in the Western world. Certainly there are those in our select fraternity who are more erudite than I am, more qualified in kabbalistic, astrological and alchemical studies - but the power to summon the spirits to visible appearance is the mark of the Thaumaturgist . That is the portion of the Sacred Art which Divine Providence has assigned me to expound and no one can teach you more about that aspect of Solomon's Magick than I can. In recent years this mission has taken on a special urgency because the ancient secret of conjuration to visible appearance in Goetic evocation that I rediscovered in 1969 (the Dark Mirror facial- reflection-distortion phenomenon) has since been pirated, over-sim- plified, mass-marketed and finally popularized to the level of a OuiJa® board session. As with the OuiJa board (which was also based on the rediscovery of an ancient magical secret) commercialization can lead to frivolous misuse. Without proper training and a knowledge of what 4"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"you are doing, the use of the powerful Dark Mirror facial reflection- distortion technique to summon spirits can seem as capricious and apparently trivial as Mr. Fuld's talking board. Ouija has been called \"The Most Dangerous Game\" but that may have to be corrected; liken- ing the perils of the Talking Board to those of the Dark Mirror is like comparing a trip to the zoo with a hunting safari in Africa - or fire crackers with dynamite. Besides the obvious psychological dangers in popularizing Goetia there is a deeper spiritual peril involved which the mass mar- keteers have totally overlooked. Granted, all Goetia spirits are not bad - some are even good natured - but there are a certain number who qualify as genuine hell-raking demons and one who is considered to be the very Devil Himself. In the Middle Ages and in the Renaissance magicians never used the Goetia without the strongest spiritual safeguards. They depended on their faith in God and His Holy Names to protect them when deal- ing with the rebellious spirits. Today we don't have that vital reservoir of faith to draw from so we must re-establish our link with the divine and re-empower our Spiritual Guardians in order to give us a truly bal- anced magical system. This is why the Angelic Almadel must be worked in direct conjunction with the Goetia. For this reason I have gone to considerable lengths to rectify and unify these two basically complimentary Lemegeton systems. When you combine the secret of The Dark Mirror with The Lost Art of Angelic invocation into The Crystal Shewstone, you have empowered the Magick of Solomon to yield the full measure of its ancient promise. Even if you are steeped in the lore of Western occultism and still have not attained your goal of becoming a magus or enchantress (because you were not born clairvoyant) this is the book that will make those dreams come true. Certainly you'll have to work and study, but if this is the right path for you, the work will be rewarding and the study will be nourishment for your mind and your soul. 5"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"I assure you is that there are no drugs, drastic fasting regimens or dangerous yoga practices involved in this system. Providing you are in good mental and physical health, are at least eighteen years of age, and able to understand the concepts and the instructions, you should have nothing to fear from this program other than the profound transformation of which you have already been warned. You will need to master self-hypnosis and develop the ability of fixed concentration (the yoga of tratakam). Once you have properly trained yourself, you will be able to perform one of these Grand Operations of Solomon's Magick in less than an hour's time by your- self or with friends who have undergone the same training. You will be able to instruct others and start your own Lodge of Magicians - or remain a solitary master or mistress of this ancient art. You might even wish to affiliate with our brothers and sisters of the Ordo Templi Astartes - America's oldest continually operating ritual magick lodge - and learn what lies beyond Solomon's Art of Kings. The choice is entirely yours because I have provided everything you need to start you off in this book and in our documentary video, The Magick of Solomon. But before we begin, let's make sure that we agree on what High Magick (or Art Magick, to use Max Theon's term) really is and what sort of people wizards and sorceresses are - or should want to be. This is very important. First let us state what Magick is not (or should not) be:-- High Magick does not (or should not) grant the power to domi- nate and/or exploit others. In spite of its Arabian Nights' glamour we cannot claim that it will help you win lotteries, sweepstakes or make big money in the commodities market. Magick should not be thought of as a push-button technology that directs impersonal energies, nei- ther should it be used as a personal empowerment system to help one climb a corporate ladder and dazzle the opposite sex. If conscientious- ly pursued, the Art should actually achieve the opposite effect by lead- 6"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"ing you to what you really need rather than giving you what you think you want. So what is Solomon's Magick? The magician Dion Fortune gave us a concise definition of mag- ick as \"The art of causing changes in consciousness to occur in accor- dance with the will.\" This presupposes that you understand the mean- ing of the term \"art\" - because High Magick is first, last and always an Art! Magick is an artform. If we need to get technical about it we could call it a composite artform similar to grand opera. Consider the artistic elements in a Magical operation: we have the stage set; our temple (or our outdoor henge). We have the costuming: our robes, lamens, etc. There are the props: the circle, altar, crystal ball, triangle, dark mirror, swords, wands and pentacles. We create a theatrical atmosphere; candle light flickers through tendrils of exotic incense, a gong reverberates, bells chime, drums throb while the slow-motion dream dance around the circle is accompanied by a droning chant. . . followed by conjurations in Shakespearean style delivered in hypnot- ic tones. Of course Solomon's Magick is more than just good theater - but good theater is its starting point. It uses that sense of fascinated detachment you experience at a well staged theatrical production or at an impressive church service as a gateway into an altered state of con- sciousness in which your waking mind and your deep mind are in com- munication. This is our unique Western shamanic experience. If you think about it this way, these theatrical aspects of magical operations will seem quite appropriate. Remember, the so-called primitive shamans use all the musical-dramatic-artistic elements of their own native cultures, so why shouldn't we? If you are not comfortable with this Romantic-Shamanic aspect of Solomon's Magick then it is obviously not Your Path. When I say \"Romantic\" I mean it in the philosophical-artistic sense of the term. 7"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"Magicians are the ultimate romantics. To us the human spirit is divine and unbounded in its potential. Aleister Crowley - a modem magi- cian and a romantic in his own fashion - held that the greatest sin was restriction, but to my mind an even greater sin is mediocrity. My favorite Romantic maxim is the credo of Quo Vadis ~ Nero: \"Let it be wonderful or let it be terrible so long as it is uncommon!\" Which brings us to another important point: Solomon's Magick is not a get-rich-quick scheme but it will jump-start and supercharge your creative processes. If you are willing to seriously study the books I've recommended, in a few years you will have acquired an educa- tion comparable to a liberal arts degree from a university. You may be inspired to undertake formal studies in psychology, anthropology, physics, genetics or biochemistry. You may excel in any of the creative arts ... or become a spiritual leader. Magick will open these doors for you and show you the way. This is the real power and promise of King Solomon's Art - for Solomon, as you recall, was mainly noted for his wisdom. Although this type of Magick is a Royal Art it is not restrict- ed to the elite; Solomon s Magick creates the elite! The magical vision is primarily an ecstatic and transformative experience that may be enhanced by a group performance but is essen- tially subjective in its effect. In other words, this method of magick produces a controllable dreamstate wherein the practitioner summons the spirits to visible appearance and communicates with them. No other system of magick, not the Golden Dawn, Tibetan Tantra, Voodoo or Wicca offers such an authentic, spontaneous experience. Only Solomon's Magick fulfills the whispered promise of the old grimoires. The Master or Mistress of this Art shares power with the Archangels, commands the demons and walks with the Gods. If this is your desire read on and enter the Treasure Cave of the Arabian Nights where the mighty Jinn of Old King Solomon are at your command. The first challenge on your quest will be to roll a huge 8"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"stone away from the entrance to your own Magical Cavern. That stone has been built up over a lifetime out of thousands of verbalized encrus- tations such as, \"Its just your imagination!\" Introduction/Notes: 1. I am very much aware of the tremendous debt we owe to Dr W. Wynn Westcott, MacGregor Mathers and their compa- triots. They gave us the most complete and useful synthesis of Western esoteric lore since Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa in 1531 c. e. It is safe to say that there would be no modem revival of Western Magick without their efforts and virtually all of today's magicians, including this author, use their cor- respondences. They were, however, restricted by the mind- set of their era and the lack of practical techniques that would not emerge from the Orient, and re-emerge from the history of our own tradition, until the 20th century. Modem Golden Dawn adepts are now revitalizing their tradition with methods very similar to those described in this book. I like to think that our O.T.A. rediscoveries have made some con- tribution in this regard. 2. In Chapter Nine of his recent book Angel Magic (Llewellyn, 1995) my friend and colleague, Geoffrey James presents a somewhat fictionalized account of an O.T.A. magical operation conducted here in our Montsalvat Temple. He describes his host (your author) as \"The Angel Magus\" who was \" ... friendly but reserved with a certain distance in his eyes that seemed to say, I have seen strange things . . .\" 9"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"Memorg througli the .9lges spans 'To Olden 'l(jngs with 6foody hands .9Lnd yet witli birth. the vision fries . . . tBegond'1Jie 'l/ei{- but never dies '1Jie portae cracR§ a hairin dreams 'Ihe wliistCing Wind of Zuvran screams: Hou: far wouldyou dare to Me. . .

Chapter One: J{yprwsis anti 90ga After familiarizing myself with the operation of the Chevreul Pendulum I began to ask my subconscious mind questions of a very personal nature. It did not always give me the answers I wanted or even expected, lending an air of credibility to the process. When I was totally convinced of the validity of the technique, I asked the ultimate question: \"Do you remember past lives?\" The answer was strong and unmistakable. \"Yes!\" it told me. From the author s Magical Record of 1969 O NE OF THE GREATEST DISCOVERIES I made in the course of my illness was a realization of the awesome depth and range of knowledge available to the subconscious mind. Even though I count myself an imaginative, articulate writer, mere words cannot describe the experience of such a revelation. When I say you are going to become one of \"The Far-Seeing People\" I mean more by that than you can possibly grasp before you begin your training. 10"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"Because of the crucial importance of a \"Long Track\", multi-life- time perspective in your dedication to Magick, you must begin your program with these consciousness expanding and knowledge extend- ing exercises. Although your religious and folkloric heritage is impor- tant, Magick will teach you that your beliefs are actually tools and weapons. You are at the center of your reflection of the Universe. You can believe anything you choose and the Universe will give it to you. Let me give you an example: A secret ritual, transmitted to me orally by my Tibetan guru, per- mitted me entrance to a sensual astral paradise populated by volup- tuous, insatiable dakinis. After an orgy that seemed to last for days, during which I realized every sexual fantasy I'd ever entertained, I finally descended, like the ancient Romans, into decadence and ulti- mately into satiated voyeurism. The dakinis were very accommodat- ing, doing whatever I could think of to entertain me ... Finally I'd had enough. I tried to escape from them but they were everywhere, smil- ing, giggling, flirting, posing and purring like kittens. At last I wormed my way through the wiggling hoard of naked, velvet-skinned, perfumed houris to a lake in the center of The City of the Damsels. In the middle of this pond floated a small boat. In the boat sat a long bearded man holding a fishing pole. I dived into the water and swam out to him. Fortunately the dakinis couldn't (or wouldn't) swim, so I was free of them at last. I clambered into the boat and intro- duced myself. \"How long have you been here?\" I asked him. \"I lost count after the first thousand years,\" he said. \"Are there any fish in this lake?\" \"I've never had a bite,\" he said with a faint smile. \"Then why do you fish?\" \"It passes the time,\" he whispered. Fortunately for me, I was only visiting The City. I had not cho- sen it as my Heaven or perhaps my Bodhisavatta vows had come to my rescue - at least in this astral adventure. And yet Vajrayogini was not so easily dismissed. She then physically manifested Herself in beauti- 11"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"ful human form (disembodied spirits have a penchant for doing this). I took her with me on an expedition to the ruins of lost Lemuria (Nan Modal) - and upon that hangs another tale ... Ibn Saba, The Old Man of the Mountain, who had promised his followers a similar sensual paradise, once said: \"Nothing is true. Everything is permitted.\" This is essentially correct but what Saba, Grand Master of the Assassins, did not mention was the price. 1. Another medieval Arabian sage placed the age of our human race at forty-four thousand years. Only in the past century did science confirm this. Considering the age of us all and the special effort you have made to obtain this book I will wager that you have walked this path before. If so, you will understand the essence of the teachings revealed in the next paragraph. During magical operations a camera will not record Angels fly- ing down through shimmering clouds or demons crawling up through smoking cracks in the earth - but these Mighty Beings are nonethe- less real and very powerful. They exist beyond the limits of your per- sonal imagination and yet they are seen through your prism in the multi-faceted lens of The Great Universal Mind. They can be super- human, sub-human or non-human. They rise up from the vast, dark depths of The Collective Unconscious and swim into the shallow lagoons of our individual subconscious minds. According to our Neo- Romantic Philosophy, this Universal Ocean of the Deep Mind extends beyond the furthest limits of Interstellar Space, penetrates the small- est sub-atomic particles and is connected with the Primordial Imprint of DNA. It is mirrored in the Anti-Matter Universe that exists side-by- side with our mundane dimension. We think, therefore we are - and are not! The \"Idea\" of a thing and the energy that flows into its cre- ation are greater realities than the static physical result. We can imag- ine nothing as great or greater than God's conceptions, therefore our God-given ideas of soul transmigration, reincarnation and magick must exist for those of us who believe in such concepts because ifsuch were not true it would mean that humankind had conceived a master 12"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"plan of spiritual evolution beyond God's power to grant. Given the awesome age, size, cohesion, symmetry, synchronicity and ultimate mystery of the Universe this would seem to be the one and only true impossibility. These precepts are the foundation of our modem Magical Field Theory. Beyond these conceptions lies the inevitable truth that ALL sentient beings are merely dittering reflections of your- selt If you understand and embrace these principles you will soon grasp the importance of self-hypnosis and Raja Yoga as basic access techniques and prerequisite skills to mastering The Magical Art. In 1969, as mentioned in the introduction, I discovered, or more properly, rediscovered, the essential secret key to Solomonic magical evocation. I found out how to summon spirits to visible appearance and converse with them without depending on special psychic talent - but first I had to learn self-hypnosis, and so will you. Granted you can get the facial reflection-distortion method to work without learn- ing hypnosis and yoga. Children have been scaring themselves with the phenomenon for as long there have been mirrors - but then you can't control it any more than they can. Unlike children, you are not going to scream and run --even though it might be better if you did! Without the perception of one who understands and controls his own trance you are operating in an unfamiliar state of mind and dabbling with something beyond your conscious comprehension. Because self-hypnosis was so important in my development, let me tell you briefly how I got into it and how it led me to discovering the secret of the mirror-in-the-triangle and its full significance. You've already read my biographic sketch so you know my qualifications but they do not tell the real story. In truth, I had learned the methods and the philosophy I'm now sharing before I ever attained the credentials cited in my resume. The remarkable discovery of Solomon's hypnotic secrets actually propelled me through seven years of anthropology, thirty-nine degrees of Freemasonry and a year of intensive Tibetan Tantric training under the finest magicians to come out of that mysterious land. Now I want to share these original 13"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"concepts and techniques so that they may open similar gateways for others who choose this path. In 1969 I was a former Green Beret and an avid scuba-diver eking out a living as a pulp-fiction writer. I had two paperback novels and a series of underwater adventure stories in ARGOSY magazine to my credit. Any impression I might have had at that time about ancient sorcery would have come from the fantasies of H. P. Lovecraft or Robert E. Howard. I liked science fiction and I had a good imagination - but, before my illness set in, I never dreamed that reviving the lost art of Solomon's Magick would become the major creative effort of my life. Like so many writers in those days I was a chain-smoker and a perpetual coffee drinker. I assumed that these bad habits were respon- sible for my frequent bouts with indigestion. This condition became chronic and finally unbearable. I went to a doctor and was diagnosed as having an ulcer. At that time stomach ulcers were thought to be entirely psychosomatic. A 'sissy' disease for a macho type. I wasn't about to give up beer, coffee, cigarettes and steak dinners to go on a milktoast diet. I reasoned that if ulcers were caused by anxiety, I'd con- quer my inner fears through self-hypnosis and heal myself in the process. In desperation I learned the theory and mastered the techniques quickly. My text was Leslie M. Lef.ron's, Self Hypnotism, The Technique and Use in Daily Living. (This book has since gone through several editions and is now considered a classic.) I was soon able to suppress the pain ... but then it would always return, often worse than before. I must have taken myself as deep into trance as anyone has ever managed through self-induction, but I could not cure the ulcer because - as the doctors eventually discovered when I was almost dead - I was carrying within me a gallbladder that had turned into a mass of solid rock! In the later stage of my illness I was in an altered state of mind that I now realize was a toxic psychosis. Subconsciously I must have 14"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"known that I was dying. This morbid condition drove me to stranger and more esoteric experiments in self-hypnosis. I began my occult studies with Tantric yoga - but, when I discovered our own culture's magical counterpart to that Eastern system, something clicked. I knew with absolute certainty that Western Ceremonial Magick was my path and I would discover its lost secret. From my studies and my first experiments I had leamed that a hypnotic effect could be achieved through a fixed gaze on a reflective surface such as a crystal ball, or a dark mirror - and I knew that these devices had often been used by the old magicians - but were they the actual spiritus locii, the place where angels and spirits could be con- jured to visible appearance? I could put myself into a hypnoidal state staring at them but I did not see a face appear or sense a genuine pres- ence - and yet I was convinced that hypnosis was necessary and that some sort of window into the other dimension, like the crystal or the dark mirror, had to be employed. But, if this was true, then why did Golden Dawn magician Aleister Crowley, and his mentor, Alan Bennett, waste so much time and effort unsuccessfully trying to evoke a Goetia spirit out of the smoke from an incense burner? Why did the Golden Dawn oath-bind its members not to undergo hypnosis - and why did they virtually eschew those traditional conjuration devices of medieval and Renaissance magicians? On one level we can answer these questions by recalling that in their time the hypnotic trance was equated with spiritualism and mag- netizing quackery. In parlor room seances crystal balls were as com- mon as OuiJa boards and even dark mirrors were sometimes used. Slaying on these devices was assumed to be humbug because of its widespread popularity. The burlesque image of the Gypsy fortune teller with her crystal ball is a cultural icon left over from that era. But, at a deeper level a more subtle and insidious mental attitude had infected the intelligentsia at the end of the Renaissance and would cheat later generations of Western magicians out of their heritage. 15"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"The philosopher (1595-1650) Rene Descartes - the father of Rational Philosophy - had been inadvertently responsible for what the military calls \"collateral damage\" to spiritual development in the Western World. In the service of fledgling science he had declared that there was a total separation between mind and matter; between men- tal conception and its physical manifestation. Although this is an over simplified statement of his theory it is a deadly accurate assessment of its effect. Although his construct allowed for advances in engineering, the divinely inspired human imagination - the greatest creative force in the universe - had been relegated to the importance of childhood day-dreaming! Once you grasp the significance of this outrage against your per- sonal divinity you are just starting to move that giant Stone away from the entrance to your Treasure Cavern. When you return to Plato and realize that the original idea of something is more dynamically real than its eventual static, physical manifestation, you can hear and feel that huge boulder start to move. It makes a skreeking sound of protest because you have recovered one of the great suppressed secrets of magick: the creative power of the human mind. But simply recogniz- ing this power will not unleash its potential. Along with The Stone we have another enemy within our- selves:The Chattering Monkey of the conscious mind. As we heave against the rock, the Monkey dances around us distracting our atten- tion and belittling our efforts. Finally we become so frustrated and dis- couraged that we give up and return to \"reality\" - and immediately our nasty little Monkey disappears. Unfortunately he will return whenever we try to quiet our minds and resume our spiritual work - so we have to get rid of the Monkey. Then we have to train ourselves to use this mental power in much the same way that an athlete trains to perfect his or her sporting skills. If you don't think this is necessary, if you don't believe that you need to master self-hypnosis and the tratakam yoga technique to practice Solomon's Magick, I'll challenge you to test yourself. 16"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"Take a few deep breaths and then stare at your wrist watch with a fixed, unmoving gaze for three minutes. During that time you may breathe normally but you must not blink, you must not think of anything and you must not change your visual focus. If you perform this test correctly you will find yourself in an Alpha (hypnoidal) state when the exercise is completed. Why do I say, you must not blink? Because the unblinking stare ( tratakam ) is totally committed to its object - and it is the hallmark of the true magician. However, if you pass this test you will still want to study this chapter carefully to understand the unique hypnotic characteristics of the magical trance state. You will also need to go through the exercis- es so that you can teach them to others. Do not assume that because you've gone through a Golden Dawn style program that you can skip this part of your training. Remember, the Golden Dawn avoided any form of hypnosis and was not preparing its members to use Solomonic magical equipment. Relying on the Golden Dawn's indirect mental conditioning proce- dures as preparation for Solomonic work would be analogous to sub- stituting basic (soft) Tai Chi training for the rigorous preparation nec- essary to compete in a full-contact Karate match. Granted a Tai Chi master (or in our case, a Golden Dawn adept) could certainly hold his own, but only after years of training. Solomon's magick is the Art of evoking spirits to visible appear- ance and invoking knowledge of, and conversation with, Holy Angels - whereas much of Golden Dawn magick is of the \"Do-the-ritual-to- imprint-the-astral-and-then-see-what-happens-later\" variety. 2. Be sure you realize the difference. There is also a shade of difference between most yoga trances and the hypnotic state as we know it here in the West. This is best illus- trated by another anecdote from my Tibetan training: early in the pro- gram I was trying to master a ritual in which I was to assume the form of Vajrayogini and perform various symbolic actions in Her persona. 17"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"Knowing that mudras (hand and finger positions) are sometimes done while visualizing, I asked Lama Luding Khen Rimpoche if I was to emulate any of the actual gestures of the deity as pictured in Her tanka (icon). After a good natured chuckle at my expense he patiently explained that this was all done in the mind while sitting inert and physically anesthetized in the lotus asana - somewhat like a Western pathworking. Most Tibetan magick is done from the inert, seated asana posi- tion whereas much of Solomon's magick is performed standing up and even moving. Our hypnotic trance allows us a unique mobility and a remarkable capacity to operate in the subconscious and conscious mind simultaneously. This enables the operator to ask the receiver, \"Do you have a presence?\" or \"Would you like it stronger?\" without disrupting the trance state. In a solo working the operator can question his own spirit manifestation directly, going back and forth between his own rational mind and the manifestation from his subconscious as nor- mally as he would carry on a conversation with another person. The reason for this is implicit in the dialog nature of hypnotic induction - and especially the self-directed dialog developed in self-hypnosis training. 3. Although the tratakam (fixed gaze) yoga technique is an Eastern derivation, it is the most directly hypnotic of the yoga prac- tices and integrates perfectly with other aspects of Western style hyp- notic induction. As a pre-requisite to tratakam and hypnosis general- ly, pranayama (controlled breathing) training is also necessary. The magical student does not need to carry this any further than and 8-8-8 count but he or she should be comfortable with at least a 6-6-6 cycle (no pun intended). It is not my intention to write complete treatises on self-hypno- sis and Raja Yoga in this book. You are expected to consult the practi- cal manuals we recommend on these subjects and follow their instruc- tions. I was fortunate enough to discover two of the finest training guides on each of these fields back when I started my practice of mag- 18"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"ick twenty-five years ago. These two books have remained constantly in print ever since. For self-hypnosis, see Leslie M. LeCron's Self- Hypnotisim, The Technique and Use in Daily Living, and for Raja Yoga, Dr Rammutri Mishra's Fundamentals of Yoga. Many people have already experienced hypnosis induced by someone else but the magician must master the technique of self- induction. The reason for this is that magick operates through the will of the operator and yet the operator must be in trance when he or she operates. This sounds like a paradox. Isn't the hypnotic trance a pas- sive state? Not necessarily. The hypnotic state is really a condition of total, one-pointed concentration. It can be passive or active - but, if it is to be active, then the operator needs to get himself into it or par- ticipate in a preliminary meditation wherein the whole circle becomes entranced. In the Orient, hypnotists always put themselves into trance before they attempt to hypnotize others. Even if you have been subjected to the hypnotic state by some- one else, you are going to find self-hypnosis a remarkable experience. Perfecting this technique can be one of the major transforming ele- ments in your life. For the very first time, you are in total control of you! And, as discussed at the beginning of this chapter, you can then access your memories back to the dawn of our race. When a true adept says that one should not practice magick without initiation, this is the experience he is referring to, not to some pageant performed in a lodge room. Once you have crossed this threshold in your development you have empowered yourself to practice Solomon's magick. The hypnot- ic state is total concentration and total involvement of both levels of your mind. If you operate only from a conscious level you are inton- ing words and going through motions while wearing an astral blindfold and ear muffs. As we have noted, this is a form of magick but it is not the Thaumaturgic Art of Solomon. Although you will be combining elements of tratakam yoga and hypnosis, you need to know the subtle difference between the two sys- 19"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"terns: Tratakam yoga (empty-minded, undistracted fixed gaze on an inert object) will induce the hypnodial states called yoganindra (phys- ical anesthesia) and then samadhi (space-time suspension) as side effects but it is not a true hypnotic induction because there is no direc- tion involved beyond strict maintenance of a passive mental attitude. Tratakam is more properly a form of meditation. It is essential train- ing for our Solomonic mirror and crystal skrying because it conditions us to see something without \"looking at it\", to contemplate our reflec- tion in a dark mirror, or the angelic aura surrounding a crystal ball, without analyzing the optical phenomena as they occur. It is easily mastered with regular daily practice. If you get discouraged just remember that John Dee and Cagliostro would have given their for- tunes and have devoted years to practice and to master these tech- niques if they had only known they were available. Practical 'Exercises: There are a number of ways to practice tratakam. Dr. Mishra lists nasal and frontal gaze exercises which are uncomfortable and alien to Western practitioners. We recommend an easily constructed variation of one of his techniques involving a blue light bulb behind a 12\" dia. round carboard shield with a 1112\" dia. filtered hole cut in the center. In the center of the frosted filter, place a 112\" dia. black dot. This device is suspended from the ceiling. We call it a \"Samadhi Lamp.\" To use the samadhi lamp, do your stretching exercises, take your asana, do a few minutes pranayama and then lie flat on your back and fix your gaze on the illuminated hole, with its central black dot, for ten to fifteen minutes. Do not explore the lamp with your eyes, just look at its glowing center. Try not to think about the optical phenomenon as they occur. Try not to think about the relaxation and numbness coming over you or the hypnotic state you are drifting into ... Try not to think at all ... 20"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"Along with your tratakam training you will be regularly improv- ing your skills in self-hypnosis. The first key to mastering self-hypno- sis is physical/mental relaxation. You'll notice I've joined the two words together because they go together. Physical relaxation is best achieved by first stretching the mus- cles of the body and then compressing them. For stretching do the clas- sic yoga \"Sun Salute\", then for compression, point out and stiffen each leg in tum, curling your toes. Hold the leg rigid for ten seconds. Thrust each arm out straight and make a hard fist. Hold it for ten sec- onds. Relax. Roll your head in a circle. Open your mouth and work your jaw muscles. Tighten the muscles of your face. Take several long, deep breaths through your nose. Hold the air in your chest at least as long as it took you to inspire it - then blow it out through your mouth. Having achieved relaxation you must learn to empty your mind. To empty the mind and to develop the ability to shift the center of consciousness to other parts of the body take a comfortable asana position with your back straight. Close your eyes and focus them upward without strain. While maintaining this position and gaze per- form at least four cycles of simple pranayama (without hand manipu- lations) on a four count inhale, four count hold, four count exhale, four count hold-on-the-void. With your breathing finished keep your closed eyes focused upwards while you quietly imagine that your body is growing larger and larger until it is nearly fifty feet tall. Your skull is a great, dim-lit hollow vault half filled with deep, dark, still water. You (your consciousness point) are in the form of a small pearl floating half-submerged in the water. The water is comfortable, safe and pro- tective. Above you are the random thoughts that flit across your mind. You see them in the form of luminous fireflies darting back and forth to no purpose. They buzz and chitter without meaning. You allow yourself to sink just below the surface. Now you can neither hear nor see those distracting thoughts. You are at peace with- 21"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"in yourself. You sink: down to the level of your throat . . . and then down into your chest ... After three minutes you may re-surface, realizing that you are now the master of your mind. These unwanted thoughts that have plagued you for so long are no more bothersome than gnats on sum- mer day. Now you are ready to hypnotize yourself or, if you have been leading a group in these exercises, you are all ready to enter the hyp- notic state. Here follows one of our ritual hypnotic inductions you may modify and practice with. . . This one is adapted from our advanced pathworking system but it gives the general idea. (The Soul Door referred to is a floor-to-ceiling dark mirror set in an ancient Egyptian style door frame. You can see it veiled in the video.) Note that we make the inert, seated physical body huge and keep the enlivened spir- itual body within - into which we project our consciousness - very small.

We sit like great stone statues surrounding our double cube altar - which has become a huge, tall building . . . Our Spirit bodies within us are now as small as a finger on the hand of our huge sleeping physi- cal forms. These tiny Spiritual Bodies are now the radiant centers of our consciousness. We are filled with living energy and eager to be off on our journey. We look to Westward and see the distant star of our destination, the Sephira of ' as it beckons to us far away in the night sky beyond the great pylons of The Soul Door Gate. Now we allow our physical eyelids to finally close. We project our Spiritual Bodies out the Third Eye Chakra toward the Soul Door 22"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"Gate and through the great pylons into the vast night sky of the endless universe!

It is likewise a vital skill necessary for exploring the powerful psychic centers or chakras within your body. With self- hypnosis and Raja Yoga training you can master even advanced tech- niques such as this in months instead of years. It is said that a picture is worth a thousand words. I hope that the mental imagery evoked by the above passage will serve to convince you of the importance of hypnosis and yoga as basic foundation skills for this Art. Do not neglect your mental training. Chapter One/iJ,{ptes: 1. To understand the mystery of the false paradise, students of Solomon's Magick should read Burton's original version of The City of Brass in Alf Layah wa Layah, THE ARABIAN NIGHTS. 2. This statement may disturb some of my senior G. D. colleagues who have become genuine shamanic wizards in spite of the Golden Dawn's non-hypnotic methods. This is not to say that the creative visualizations in the Pentagram and Middle Pillar rituals are not very valuable and even essential in their own right -but they are project- ed onto the astral, not received from it. The G.D.'s Tattwa skrying exercises were taken directly from an Eastern source. 3. Those who have popularized our evocation technique have stated that solo operations are quite difficult, possibly dangerous, and should be avoided. This demonstrates their lack of understanding of the impor- tance of self-hypnotic training in Solomonic magick. A solo operation (for an entity of the same sex as the operator) is usually less difficult due to the reduction of the personal variables involved. 23"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"1(nowtfiat the.

My first introduction to Western Magick still stands as the best survey work written on the practical aspects of the subject: The Black Arts by Richard Cavendish, published in 1968. Using Cavendish's excellent bibliography, I quickly acquired Waite's The Book of BlackMagic and of Pacts along with the Mathers-Crowley Goetia , Mathers' The Key of Solomon the King, and Francis Barrett's The Magus. 24"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"The medieval Key of Solomon provided an authentic handbook for making magical regalia, implements and talismans but it was the more notorious Goetia of the Lemegeton, the so-called Lesser Key af Soloman, that was the real wizard's Liber Spiritum. The Goetia (pro- nounced, Go-ey--sha ) catalogued and described 72 rebellious spirits that, according to a Talmudic legend, old King Solomon had impris- oned in an enchanted Brass Vessel submerged in a lake in Babylon. This read like a fabulous tale from the Arabian Nights but in my irra- tional state I was convinced that there was a hidden truth behind the fantastic story. Like Aladdin's wonderful lamp or Ali Baba's \"Open Sesame\" there was a Secret Key to calling up those mighty Princes of the Jinn that Solomon had imprisoned so long ago - and I was deter- mined to find it. Years later, when I was doing graduate studies in cultural anthropology I realized that back in 1969 I had crossed over into a realm of divine madness that few Anglo-Americans had ever experi- enced. I had gone through the true shamanic initiation, that mortal ill- ness and vision quest that brings the shaman in touch with his gods and gives him the power to practice his craft .... It was during that season of my madness, when agony alternat- ed with ecstasy, that I had discovered, or more properly, re-discov- ered, the lost secret of the Magical Art and I wrote The Book of Astarte from which the key passage that heads this chapter is drawn. 1. I had studied the writings of the ancient and modem magicians. They had filled their books with the most detailed instructions on how to build, inscribe and decorate all the necessary equipment, all the sig- natures of the spirits and even the hours during which to summon them - but the most important element, that method by which one could make the spirit physically appear, was always missing in the old gri- moires and not explained in the recent texts. I knew that over a dozen ancient and modem writers on Magick could not be involved in one big, long-standing conspiracy to suppress this [mal secret, so it seemed obvious that at some time after the 17th 25"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"century and before the middle of the 19th century the practical keys to the Magical evocation and invocation processes had been lost. This turned out to be true. The ancient writers had hidden the secrets in plain sight - as you will see when we examine the old texts - but the Victorian age magicians of the Golden Dawn school, with their phobia against hypnosis and their commendable distrust of pas- sive spiritualist mediumship, had de-emphasized the actual methods of Renaissance evocation and invocation in favor of a Westernized Tantra in which images were carefully built up in the imagination and then allowed to provide psychic feed-back. Instead of the traditional crys- tals and dark mirrors for visionary work, they prefered to use abstract colored symbols to stimulate the imagination. These methods are dif- ferent in conception and technique from the shamanic calling down or summoning up of spontaneous visions from that great storehouse of images Renaissance magicians knew as the \"World Soul\" and we now refer to as \"The Collective Unconscious.\" If I hadn't been touched with divine madness at the time I prob- ably would have accepted the Victorian reconstruction of Magick and put aside my yearning to actually conjure spirits to visible appearance in Solomon's Triangle of Art. I would have agreed with critics like Professor Eliza Butler that those who had practiced out of the old gri- moires were credulous and self-deluded. However Arthur Edward Waite, who was also a ruthless critic of the Art Magical, had conceded that they achieved results. In the introduction to his 1898 Book of Black Magic and of Pacts he wrote: - \"It would, however, be unsafe to affirm that all persons making use of the ceremonies in the rituals would fail to obtain results. Perhaps in the majority of cases most of such experiments made in the past were attended with results of a kind. To enter the path of hallucination is likely to insure hallucination, and in the presence of hypnotic and clairvoyant facts it 26"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"would be absurd to suppose that the seering processes of ancient magic - which were many - did not produce seership, or that the auto-hypnotic state which much magical ritual would obviously tend to occasion in predisposed persons did not frequently induce it, and not always only in the predisposed. To this extent some of the processes are practical, and to this extent they are dangerous.\" (emphases mine) This paragraph was one of the clues that set me on the trail to discovering the secret of Solomon's Triangle. It should be noted that I had first read all of the available 16th and 17th century material before I got into Regardie and the Golden Dawn. Therefore my original per- spective was, and still remains, that of a Renaissance magician rather than a Victorian occultist (even though I will be the first to concede our tremendous debt to the Golden Dawn). I think it is important to men- tion this because there is a natural tendency for people to be heavily influenced by their first impressions in any field of endeavor. This was especially true in my case given my near-terminal ill- ness and altered state of consciousness. I literally devoured the books listed above with the obsession of a religious fanatic. But, even in the grip of a toxic psychosis, I hadn't lost my intellect. Madness is known to stimulate genius. I was on the verge of discovering, or re-discover- ing, an extraordinary secret hidden in these quaint, and apparently whimsical, books of forgotten lore. I knew there had to be a way to make Solomon's traditional operations actually work without resorting to drugs, fasting or endless conjurations to produce hallucinations through hysteria and exhaus- tion. A century ago Aleister Crowley had tried to conjure one of the Lemegeton's Goetia demons out of incense smoke. He had very little success after a great deal of effort. As a self-taught hypnotist this did 27"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"not surprise me. Trying to form an image, or commanding a spirit to produce an image, out of curling, twisting smoke was more of an experiment in telekinesis than a skrying process. Crowley obviously did not know the technique but he certainly understood the philosophy. He stated it clearly in his 1904 edition of the Goetia: - \"B ut can any of the effects described in this our book Goetia be obtained, and if so, can you give a rational explanation of the circumstances ? Say you so? I can, and will. The spirits of the Goetia are portions of the human brain. Their seals therefore represent (Mr. Spencer's projected cube) methods of stimulating or regulating those particular spots (through the eye). The names of God are vibrations calculated to establish: (a) General control of the brain. (Establish- ment of functions relative to the subtle world.) (b) Control over the brain in detail. (Rank or type of the Spirit.) (c) Control of one special portion. (Name of the Spirit.) The perfumes aid this through smell. Usually the perfume will only tend to control a large area; but there is an attribution of perfumes to letters of the alphabet enabling one, by a Qabalistic formula, to spell out the Spirit's name. I need not enter into more particular discussion of these points; the intelligent reader can easily fill in what is lacking. If, then, I say, with Solomon: \"The Spirit Cimieries teaches logic,\" what I mean is:\" Those portions of my brain which subserve the logical facul- ty may be stimulated and developed by following out the processes called \"The Invocation of Cimieries.\" 28"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"I have quoted the above passage at some length because it made such a strong impression on me when I first read it. It is certainly not romantic or artistic; in fact it is downright analytical - like wiring a ballet dancer with electronic sensors so we can get a scientific read-out on Swan Lake - but it serves an absolutely necessary purpose. Crowley's statement places Solomon's Magick squarely within the parameters of a psychological system. \"Solomon s Spirits are portions of the human brain. \" - But the human brain is only the hardware for the greatest computer system ever designed: The Human Mind. A modem hacker- magus would say we run our Solomonic Magick program on an oper- ating system designed by Carl lung using a language called \"Agrippa 777.\" For those of you who are not yet magical cybernauts that needs some explaining: Crowley's conceptions of Magick pre-dated Carl lung's Archetypes in the Collective Unconscious theory. Crowley knew that magical manifestations involved altered states of conscious- ness and could produce psychosomatic effects but he may not have been aware that entire pantheons of ancient Gods and Goddesses, choirs of Angels and hordes of demons might exist in the deepest reaches of everyone's mind. Actually this theory was not very modem. Around 200 A.D. Hermes Trismegistus, the mysterious founder of Hermetic Philosophy, had written in his Asclepius that: \"The Gods of the Zodiac are eternal but man himself creates his own lesser gods.\" The implications of this statement were awesome. If we create gods, then we control them! And if we can control them, are we not Gods ourselves? ( In Your Temple You are One with the Gods! ) This is why the late Warburg Institute scholar Francis Yates called the Asclepius \"The charge of dynamite behind Renaissance Neoplatonism.\" Echoes of that explosion reverberate in the words of Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa written in 1527: \" ... Such things are delivered and writ by great and grave philosophers, whose traditions who dare say 29"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"are false? Nay, it were impious to think them lies: only there is anoth- er meaning than what is writ with the bare letters. We must not look for the principle of these grand operations without ourselves; it is that internal spirit within us which can very well perform whatsoever the monstrous Mathematicians, the prodigious Magicians, the wonderful Alchymists and the bewitching Necromancers can effect.\" In the 1920's lung declared that beneath and beyond the per- sonal subconscious mind there flowed a vast deep sea of dream images and forgotten lore he refered to as \"The Collective Unconscious\". This mysterious psychic ocean was not the exclusive property of any individual human being. It was a dimension shared by us all! Here one might discover the great Archetypes of mythology: the heroes, the beautiful courtesans, the martyred saints and monstrous villains of our past. Here were the mysterious man-created gods which Hermes Trismegistus had written about so long ago. Here was the World Soul of the Renaissance magicians. Here were the demons of Solomon's Brass Vessel. When lung discussed his theory with his famous colleague, Sigmund Freud, Freud was horrified. \"Carll\" he whispered. \"If you reveal this to the public you will release a black flood of occultism!\" However it would take more than just a theory to release the flood of occultism Freud feared. Theories by themselves do not pro- duce results. For results the magician still depends today as he did thousands of years ago on methods and techniques. Since time immemorial magicians have placed themselves and others into states of trance during which visions and oracles were received. We now know that this process was hypnotic and that all the phenomena we have come to associate with modern hypnosis were in fact known and practiced by ancient sorcerers under the guise of 'fas- cination', 'spell-casting' and 'enchantment' ... The powerful hypnotic effect achieved through a fixed gaze on a reflective surface is the reason why the crystal ball, or shewstone, 30"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"and the dark mirror, or speculum, were used by the wizards of olden times as their spiritus locii, the actual place where angels and spirits could be conjured to visible appearance. This was and still is a hyp- notic process . . . . However the final secret of how to use these magi- cal aides was always missing. With all the philosophy, the atmosphere, the paraphernalia, the powerful conjurations and the hypnotic tech- niques, such spontaneous visions in a crystal or in a dark mirror, still depended upon some special psychic talent. To make it really work one had to be a natural medium - so, with all my hypnotic experi- ments and my toxic fever dreams, I had certainly become a mystic ... but not a clairvoyant. This is a very important point. Mediums, psychics and clairvoy- ants have dominated the mystic arts for centuries because most of us have assumed that they are the only ones gifted with the abilities to see and hear the spirits. This situation was so pervasive that even great magicians like Abramelin the Mage, Dr. John Dee,2. Count Cagliostro and the later Frederick Hockley thought they had to employ specially talented skryers or gifted children to do the actual receiving for them. If I had been in a fully rational state at the time I probably would have accepted this historically established handicap - but obsessed genius knows no bounds. I was convinced there had to be a way, a method by which any- one with the desire and the determination could summon spirits to vis- ible appearance and converse with them. This was what Solomon had promised and - like the indefatigable amateur archaeologist, Heinrich Schlieman who had actually discovered ancient Troy right where Homer said it was - I was sure that the medieval 'Solomon' was telling the truth. I could place a crystal ball into the triangle but then if I stood back inside the magick circle, as the operator was supposed to do according to the ancient texts, even a 60mm crystal ball would appear the size of a door knob -- but I knew something had to be placed in that triangle: something fascinating, something hypnotic and something large 31"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"enough to provide a viewing surface. . . Obviously the speculum: the Dark Mirror . . . And what better entrance into that realm the mystic poet Coleridge had called, \"Caverns measureless to man. \" It had to be the dark mirror! - but how to use it? How to make it actually work, I asked myself - then something I had read the year before jogged my memory - something I had read somewhere about the use of dark mirrors in the Far East ... ? That final all-important clue had been sitting right there on my book shelf! The secret was in a work called Tantra, the Yoga of Sex by Omar Garrison published in 1964. In this book the author explained an ancient Oriental method for conjuring up images of previous incarna- tions from the reflection of one s own face . . . in a dark mirror . . . flanked by candles ! As I re-read this passage in Garrison's book I felt a shiver of excitement. I was experiencing the same tingling exhilaration that an archaeologist must feel when he brushes the sand away and looks down at the unbroken seal of an ancient royal tomb! I tried Garrison's experiment and found that it worked with remarkable effectiveness. If a person in a darkened room stares for several minutes into a mirror flanked by candles, a strange phenomenon will almost always happen: The familiar reflection will fade out and disappear. The mirror will go black and, when the image returns, it will be the face of someone or something else! This experience is usually accompanied by a profound sense of an other-worldly presence . . . It was obvious that this phenomenon must have been discovered a long time before any concept of reincarnation. It probably went back as far as the paleolithic when stone-age people stared fascinated at their reflections in dark, still pools of water, seeing the strange transformation occur - and being convinced they were in the presence of their Gods! I suspected that in a ritual setting, using traditional conjurations and symbols, specific spirits and even ancient Gods and Goddesses might be summoned from the 'Other Side' ... This might well be the 32"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"ancient secret behind that strange passage in the Bible that reads: \"Godfashioned Man in His own image\" It was certainly the reason why Solomon has us command the spir- it, often described as a monstrous hybrid, to \"Appear in fair and human form and speak unto us in a clear, intelligible voice in our mother tongue. \" After this discovery the use of the magick mirror in an elevated tri- angle seemed obvious. Our 17th Century Lemegeton manuscript, Sloane 2731 clearly shows a large black-filled circle in the center of Solomon's Triangle. (See figure 1. ) Figure 1.-- Detailfrom British Library Sloane MS. 2731 showing and describing the Triangle to be used in Goetia workings.

We know that polished obsidian mirrors were used in the neolithic Middle-Eastern city of Katal Hyuck as far back as nine thousand years ago - before The Great Flood. And later, in the time of Solomon, the Egyptians and the Canaanites made mirrors of polished copper and of silver, metals attributed to the planet Venus and the Moon ... . . . Let your mind travel back to those ancient times and imagine what might have happened when a Priestess sitting before her mirror, putting on her make-up in the dim light, saw her face change and become The Goddess! Perhaps she would call the High Priest to wit- ness the transformation. They would both be familiar with possessions and trance states and would be quick to see the possibilities ... Now I am certain that some of my magical colleagues will cluck in their beards and say: \"Well Runyon developed an effective system 34"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"- but it's modern.\" They will cite the fact, already mentioned, that Cagliostro, Dee, Hockley and others had to employ skryers to do their visioning. If those worthies didn't know the reflection secret, then who had known? My answer is that the medieval Arabian magicians probably knew it as these quotes from C.J.S. Thompson indicate: \"According to Arab tradition, magic or 'sihr', which means 'to produce illusion before the eyes' was revealed by two angels in Babel, named Harut and Marut, who instructed mankind in this art . . . When a miracle was deemed a , sihr' it was regarded as an optical illusion or due to an illicit dealing with demons ... The use of the magic mirror - which was made of metal or glass with a polished surface -for seeing spirits, was known to the Arabs at an early period. The image was said to appear in a cloud or vapor floating between the medium used and the , \" gazer s eye. . . Ceco d' Ascoli, Dr. Thomas Rudd and others may very well have known but kept it secret. The method was so simple that there was no need to write it down. It could have been passed from mouth-to-ear (and yet the hints in the Sloane 2731 Goetia are almost too obvious). We should recall that the Goetia was not a system magicians felt com- fortable writing about back in the days of the Inquisition. And they did not need Carl Jung's subjective psychological the- ories to justify using their own reflection as a focal point. There was a haunting Orphic myth about Dyonisus being entranced by his reflec- tion in a mirror, caught by the Titians and tom to pieces, his parts res- cued by Zeus and given to Apollo to plant in the earth - from which he rose reconstituted and revived. Here we have the modem psychological concepts of fragmenta- tion, reintegration and individuation of the personality, we also have our seventy-two all-encompassing spirits let out and then put back into The Brass Vessel. The ancients did not create such fables for idle amusement. 35"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"But my most telling argument sits in every grammar school class in the country. Along with playing hopscotch on The Tree of Life, children have a game called \"Bloody Mary\" (Clive Barker's \"Candyman\") which they have been scaring each other with as long as there have been mirrors to look into. Any modem magician who thinks his predecessors didn't discover this same phenomenon ages ago and make use of it doesn't hold them in very high regard - but to those who still insist that this method of magical evocation is modem, I will be most happy to accept credit for it. 2. In the week following my remarkable discovery (or re-discov- ery) my illness overcame me to such a degree that my doctor was com- pelled to conduct a more thorough examination. At that point he dis- covered the truth and advised me that only an operation could save my life - but that I was too debilitated and inflamed to undergo the surgery. I asked the Archangel Raphael to heal me and Prince Ba'al to give me strength - then (because the Gods help those who help them- selves) I went out and found another doctor. When I recovered from my surgical operation, health and sanity quickly returned - but I remembered what I had learned during my sabbatical in Tartarus and, to my surprise, I discovered that Solomon S Magick was still as effec- tive - and even more so when contrasted with my otherwise rational state of mind. To my even greater surprise, I found that this ancient system would work for any sincere person who could concentrate on a fixed point long enough to achieve a light hypnotic trance. I extended my experiments to include others and I soon discov- ered that the process was just as effective if I - as the magician - stood behind a passive 'receiver' who would only need to hold the can- dlesticks and concentrate on the mirror. At that time I was a bachelor in my thirties, living in a beachside Southern California apartment and riding a motorcycle. This put me in a position to recruit young women willing to transform into the 36"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"Goddess Astarte. These experiments, harmless as they were, made me notorious. According to a published account one of my Astartes disap- peared off the face of the Earth - and yet I saw her socially in the week following the operation. It did appear that women made the best, or perhaps the most enthusiastic, receivers but for the most part my female volunteers were not clairvoyant. Those few who were natural psychics would receive their vision \"off-face\" after the mirror blacked out. Non-psychic receivers (most of us) will see a different face replace our familiar reflection. However, it is important to note that this transformation process for non-psychics is, if anything, a more intense and con- sciousness altering experience than the more familiar visioning process the psychic undergoes. So I had the secret. Like Dr. Frankenstein, I had learned how to do it - but, even though I may have been just as obsessed as the fic- tional Victor Frankenstein, I didn't want to make his mistake. Before I opened the Brass Vessel and released these spirits into the world again, I wanted to understand the philosophy and the spiritual significance behind a process that been kept such a closely guarded secret for thou- sands of years. I had to ask myself, was it possible there were slum- bering demons from our past that - as the late Howard Phillips Lovecraft had suggested - might better be left unawakened? How and why had the beautiful Goddess Astarte and her handsome consort, Prince Ba' al, the Thunder God, become demons in the forbidden books of medieval black magick? . . .

It is a truly ancient Biblical book that belonged in the Pentateuch between Genesis and Exodus. It disappeared, along with the Ark of the Covenant, sometime after Solomon's death. A copy was known to be in the possession of the Pagan star-magicians of Harran in Syria and another was rumored to be hidden in a remote, secret monastery in Ethiopia. In 1773 the Scottish explorer, James Bruce, risked his life to smuggle two Ethiopian copies out of that ancient, legendary kingdom of \"Prester John\". 39"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"The importance of the Book of Enoch to Western Magick can- not be overstated. I. In the time of the Arabian Nights' Caliph, Harun Al-Raschid, the medieval Sabian wizards of Harran, when compelled by the Muslims to present their Holy Books, had brought forth the Book of Enoch and the Hermetic corpus. Magicians have venerated these works ever since. In mythical, prehistoric times before The Great Flood, the Book of Enoch tells of a War in Heaven in which God and his loyal host of angels, led by the Archangel Michael, were arrayed against a horde of rebellious angels who had lusted after the daughters of men and had descended to earth, where they were breeding a race of giants and were teaching humans the forbidden secrets of sorcery and magick. The Arabian legend of the fallen angels Harut and Marut, quoted earlier, is only one of many mythological offshoots of this original theme. The Book of Enoch goes on to relate that the four Great Archangels, Michael, Raphael, Gabriel and Auriel (Phaniel) came down and imprisoned these Fallen Angels at the Four Comers of the Earth where they became known as \"The Watchers. \" Jewish, Christian and Islamic theologies retained the tradition- al, loyal Angels of Heaven - especially those four Great Beings who rule the Quarters of the Universe, Raphael, Michael, Gabriel and Auriel - but they had no place for the Gods and Goddesses of the ancient Pagan religions they had conquered. The Rabbis, Priests and Imams practiced a slight-of-hand trick and reclassified the homeless, but not forgotten, Pagan deities as those same \"Fallen Angels\" who were already chained in deep pits at the ends of the earth. The 17th century English Christian poet John Milton summa- rized this militant transformation process in his Paradise Lost: \"First Moloch, horrid king besmeared with blood Of Human sacrifice and parent's tears ... . . . Of Solomon he led by fraud to build His temple right against the temple of God . . . 40"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"· .. To do him wanton rites, which cost them woe. . .

Thus their greatest rival, the Canaanite thunder god, Prince Ba ' al became the demon Bael, first among the ranks of the fallen, who was said to appear as a cat, a toad or a man - or all three at once - and to grant the power of invisibility (See figure 3.)

As indeed She has! Although John Milton may have been wrong about \"Moloch\", which could be a scribe's misinterpretation of \"Malak = King\", he was otherwise quite correct. Among those Fallen Angels, transformed from the God and Goddess of ancient Canaan, you will also find the ancient Egyptian Gods, Amon-Ra (Amon) and Horus (Flauros) along with some very real demons (Belial and Asmodeus). You may dare to contact Ose, the mysterious titular spirit of shape-shifters, werewolves and leopardmen. (See The Evocation of Nithael .) This myth of The Fallen Angels laid the foundation for a Middle Eastern legend (recounted in the Talmud) about the Biblical King Solomon, who was said to have been the greatest magician of ancient times. According to our legend, Solomon, armed with the power of God's Holy Angels, bound and sealed those 72 rebellious spirits, or Genii, into the \"Brass Vessel\" - from which he called them forth to do his biding, even to assist him in building the Great and Holy Temple at Jerusalem. . . Whether or not you take these ancient myths and stories literal- ly or you consider them to be symbolic, the legend of \"The Fallen Angels\" - who became the horde of Genii in Solomon's brass bottle - forms the secret tradition and the wellspring of power behind the fabulous wizardry of the Arabian Nights and even the medieval sor- cery of Dr. Faustus. But can our fantastic legend have any truth behind it? Are we really seeing these ancient Gods and Goddesses, who became \"Fallen Angels\" , in the dark mirror on our magic triangle? Do the strange voices that speak through our lips during the magical channeling process actually come from these deities and demons of the dim past? Have we have really opened \"That lost Portal Between Worlds\" - and, if so, can these powerful Genii now be commanded to reveal secret knowledge and accomplish wonderful things? 42"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"The final proof is in the doing! I invite you to follow in my foot- steps and find out for yourself! - but, I warn you, unless you take Solomon's Magick very seriously, you should have nothing to do with these experiments! This ancient art is not a party game or a Halloween prank. There is no place for the dabbler or the thrill-seeker in the Magick Circle. All aspects of this system, from the spiritual to the psy- chological, must be thoroughly understood before any experimentation takes place. Like the knights of olden times, the magician must be trained, armed and armored before he or she goes forth to do battle ... First you should understand that The Magick Circle is the philosophical fortress that protects you when you open the gate between the worlds (see Appendix 3.). It represents the perfect circle of the vast universe and the unbroken boundary and spiritual integrity of your own being - which are one-in-the-same when you practice Solomon's Art. As above, so below; as within, so without. Let me share my personal Magick Circle formula with you. This was derived from an Archangelic invocation of Gabriel. She said that \"The Four Archangels are positioned at the Four Compass Quarters because they represent the structure of the Universe. They are four of the Mighty and Eternal Seven\". In later meditation I learned that the other three of The Seven, in our personal microcosm, are Metatron Above, Sandalphon Below and the Spirit of God within us (our Holy Guardian Angel) in our Heart Center. Using this visualization as a cir- cle-casting formula provides complete protection because you are pro- jecting an impregnable sphere all around you linked to and empower- ing a Heavenly force within you. This is why we invoke (draw down) Angels and higher spirits into the Magick Circle and evoke (call up) lesser spirits into a locus spiritus outside the Circle. 3. You should know that even back in ancient times the Triangle represented the philosophical first plane of manifestation. It acts as a cage, containing and restraining the spirits you evoke. As a hypotheti- 43"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"cal example let us imagine that we are participating in the original Act of Creation, back at the Dawn of Time and out in the vast reaches of cosmic space. First we will create just one point . . . Next we (or God) will establish a second point and connect it to the first so that we have a line - then, when we plot our third point we have our triangle; the first, flat surface ... Now, when we create Point Four, we have the first solid. We have created a thing. . . and, as long as we refrain from establishing point five, setting our thing in motion, we will constrain our creation to remain in its position. We will keep our spirit within the Triangle. From a Kabbalistic standpoint we can say that the Triangle rep- resents the Tetragrammaton in the Process of Creation: Air (Aleph), Water (Mem), Fire (Shin) combining to create Earth (Omega). 4. You should understand this symbolic geometry thoroughly before you open Solomon s Brass Vessel and release the genii . Visualize the process several times in your mind until you have made it yours. Repeat the Tetragrammaton formula as you visualize (Ah Mah Sha Oh or Sha MahAh Tah.) 4. Traditionally the Name of the Archangel Michael, the Angel of Power, was separated into three syllables; Mi- Cha - el and written in the comers of the Triangle to add a visual emphases to the symbolic geometry that bound the spirit (see Appendix 3. ). Michael is the Archangel of Power but the other three; Raphael, Gabriel and Auriel are equally important - for what good is Power without Truth, Love and Beauty? So how do we invoke these great Archangels? 9{{Jtes oj joffowing page . . . 44"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"Chapter %reeI9l[ptes: 1.

The Four Great Archangels are very much a part of our Western Tradition. They represent the positive forces that drive the engine of the universe and the love that holds it all together. From a practical point of view, they are The Tetragrammaton. They represent the Four Philosophical Elements of Creation. In the Order of the Temple of Astarte we conceive and visu- alize them as complimentary male and female beings, in keeping with the nature of their functions - for Angels can appear in any form they wish, or any suitable form that your imagination can provide for them.

Casting your circle with a traditional Pentagram Ritual before each operation is certainly important but that alone is not enough. The Great Archangels must live in your mind and in your heart - You must have them inside as well as outside. ready to help you control the rebel- lious spirits - otherwise opening the \"Brass Vessel\" would be like opening Pandora ~ Box, which, according to the ancient Greek myth, released evil into the world and could not then be re-closed. Therefore we must first master the art of Angelic Invocation before we proceed to its darker counterpart: the evocation of Solomon's 72 spirits. Along with the secret of the mirror-in-the-triangle, the other cru- cially important element missing from the Goetia is the fact that the 72 spirits of the Brass Vessel have 72 direct counterparts in the Holy Angels of the Shemhamephorash. These derived, or \"suffix\" angels are not as personified as the Four Archangels of the Quarters or the Seven Archangels of the Planetary Spheres, but they do act as specific and very effective channels of power through which those Great Archangels control each and every rebellious spirit. If this concept is not fully understood and integrated into your Goetic evocation operations, you are on spiritually dangerous ground. The careful operator should use both Goetia and Shemhamephorasb sigils and conjurations in evocational operations. Like the Goetia spirits these Shemhamephorash angels have their own special signatures and there is a short traditional invocation for each one of them. We credit these invocations to the 17th century magus, Dr Thomas Rudd. The sigils themselves come from MacGregor and Moina Mathers of the Golden Dawn who claimed to have found them in an old French magical MS. Even if this story was a veil of glamour to enhance their creation, they were certainly mas- ter magicians and their sigils are effective. 1.

Now that you understand the general theory, let's get down to practical methods. How do we go about this Angelic invocation process? There is another book in the Lemegeton compendium that prob- ably should have been published with the Goetia. It is called The Almadel of Solomon and gives us a very effective method for invok- ing - and by that I mean: calling down _. the angels. (See Figure 4.) Figure 4. -- Diagram of the waxen Almadel from British Library Sloane MS 2731, THE LEMEGETON. The original Almadel was a table-top device made entirely of wax. This was an ingenious design. The square slab of wax had holes at each comer through which the four candles were inserted, leaving 49"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"enough length below to raise the little platform high enough so that a small incense burner could be placed beneath it . . . from where the incense fumes could rise, through another set of holes, to envelop the crystal shews tone in mysterious tendrils of fragrant smoke - thus adding to the hypnotic effect. 2. As with the Goetia, the secrets of the Almadel were not clearly explained in the Lemegeton. I had to use equal measures of scholar- ship and inspiration to reconstruct and [me-tune the system ... but the effort was certainly worth the trouble because the Almadel Angels con- trol the Goetia spirits! I know that statement may be surprising to some magical schol- ars who never look beyond (to quote Cornelius Agrippa again) \"what is writ in the bare letters.\" The Almadel's Angels are not arranged in an ascending hierarchy, they are attributed to the Four Quarters and the twelve signs of the zodiac, with each. of the four Quarters governing the three astrological signs particular to its nature - in other words, the Cardinal Signs of Air, Fire, Water and Earth, which we know are governed by the Four Great Archangels of the Quarters, Raphael, Michael, Gabriel and Auriel. Realizing this we can simply disregard the late 17th century hodgepodge of garbled angelic names the Lemegeton' s scribe 3. has attributed to these \"altitudes\" and thus restore the Almadel system to its full power and purpose as delineated in our Master Mandala (see Color Plate). Each of the four Great Archangels of the Quarters empower three sets of six Shemhamephorash Angels, who in tum control three sets of six counterpart Goetia Spirits - which are distributed, two to each of the 36 dekans, or ten degree divisions of an astrological Sign. This occurs in similar order all around the zodiac (see the Master Mandala). Correcting these errors and rectifying the system intellectually was certainly necessary but of equal importance was the secret of the 50"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"actual technique. Once again I had encountered the phenomenon of a missing key. Even during the excitement of my Dark Mirror discovery, I still realized that these Great Beings of Light had to be invoked first to sta- bilize the evocation process - otherwise the legendary symbolism of the Brass Vessel would be lost. I was convinced the Almadel was the proper Invocation System simply because it, like the Goetia, was one of the five books that made up the Lemegeton. I constructed several different versions of the Almadel device, using the crystal, the candles and the incense burner, until I finally dis- covered the way to maximize the effect - and share it with others. The skryers sit, totally isolated, on low stools in semi-darkness looking up at the crystal, placed on a high table and surrounded by shielded candles (an excellent theatrical lighting effect) while spec- trally illuminated smoke curls upward. With this set-up the practition- ers are more than halfway into dreamtime before the invocation starts. When I first developed this technique we found the effect was so powerful and the experience so profound, we soon realized - even before my research confrrmed it - that we had opened the Gates of Heaven. We had called down those glorious Beings of Light whose sweet voices then whispered in our minds as we sat in reverent awe about The Holy Table of Art. But, wait a minute! Have I said anything about anybody actu- ally seeing anything in the crystal ball? No, I have not - and for a very good reason. Unless you are clairvoyant you will probably not see anything specific. However, if you have mastered self-hypnosis and the yoga of tratakam (see Chapter 1), you will witness an electric blue astral aura shot through with rays of golden light, the crystal will radiate with power and you will sense a profound change in the space- time-continuum. You will know that you are \"On Holy Ground\" and that the Angel has arrived. This is very similar to \"The Burning Bush\" experience described in the Bible. If you think of the Biblical Burning Bush as an ordinary shrub seen sillouetted on the crest of a dark ridge- 51"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"line just as the sun rises behind it, you will understand the mechanics of a miracle. . . Is this a modern, subjective approach? For the answer to that question let us go back three hundred and fifty years and consult the venerable Dr Thomas Rudd on the subject: \"If good Angels or Elemental powers of light or otherwise dig- nified Spirits of benevolent or symbolizing nature with celestial pow- ers, and allied to the welfare and preservation of mankind, are moved and called forth to visible appearance in a Crystal Stone or Glass Receiver, as one usual way or customary form is among the learned Magicians, then the sign of their appearance most seemeth like a veil or curtain or some beautiful color hanging in and about the stone or glass as a bright cloud or other pretty kind of Hierogylphical show, both strange and very delightful to behold. \" So once again we were following in the footsteps of our Ancient Masters. Unlike the dark mirror, it is not necessary to see anything spe- cific in the shewstone. You can have a tremendously powerful contact and even become a channel through which the Angel may deliver an oracle. Further on in your magical development you might undergo a life-transforming experience with this method- such as \"Knowledge and Conversation with your Holy Guardian Angel\" - and never at any time 'see' anything like a face or a recognizable symbol in the crystal. 4. If you are wondering why Angels are less visible than Spirits and Pagan God-Goddess forms, the answer is not far to seek; Angels are agents and messengers of the Supreme Power whereas Spirits and Godforms are personifications of Nature. God is a Crystal and Nature is a Mirror; God radiates and Nature reflects. Like the secret of your reflection in the Dark Mirror for evoca- tion, this knowledge frees you from dependence on psychics and clair- voyants in your Angelic invocations. You have gone beyond the limi- 52"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"tations that handicapped John Dee, Count Cagliostro and Frederick Hockley. You are in direct communication while they could only act as scribes. Our modem O.T.A. Alamadel is combined with the traditional double-cube altar (see Equipment Appendix). We have shielded can- dles at the four 'homed' comers and an incense chamber below, with slots cut around the central compass rose to allow the rising smoke to surround our crystal shewstone - which is placed on our Master Mandala that unifies the Goetia and Almadel systems in one all- encompassing design. This modem innovation of mine turned out to be just as effec- tive, in its own way, as the ancient Almadel, with the important advan- tage of being ideal for group workings. We place low stools around the foot of the altar so that four or more people may sit and gaze up at the smoke-shrouded crystal, haloed in spectral light, with nothing else in their field of vision. The operator sits in the East and serves incense through a hinged round door which replicates the Alchemical Spirit symbol. The other participants gaze at the illuminated, smoke-shrouded crystal from a low angle that automatically induces a hypnotic alpha state. Beginning in the East and passing deosil, these invocations (to be found in prac- tical section of this book) are articulated by each person in tum while the rest continue to softly chant the Archangel's name in unison. This 'round-robin' continues until all have invoked. After this the chant- ing is intensified until the operator in the East sees a \"Glory on the Altar\" and senses a presence. He or she then welcomes the Archangel and the oracular phase of the operation proceeds. Remember, you are invoking these angels, not evoking them. Invoking is similar to praying. You're calling them down and inviting them to visit you. You are asking them to help you - so you should not order them around in commanding tones and you certainly should not banish them when the operation is over. You thank them, you ask them to come again, and then you bid them \"Hail and Farewell.\" 53"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"Now that you have been introduced to the Evocation of spirits and the Invocation of angels, the time has come to explore the geog- raphy and study the architecture of their realm.

Even though we have the essential operative secrets: hypnosis, the mirror reflection phenome- non and the aura producing crystal, where do we get the special knowl- edge, the philosophy and the empowerment to use these methods in magical operations? The philosophy behind Solomon's Magick is Kabbalah. In Magick the Kabbalistic mind-set is as important as the hypnotic oper- ating technique. If hypnosis is the tactic of the wizard then Kabbalah is his strategy. About this there is comforting news and challenging news: 56"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"The challenging news is you that you cannot escape learning the basics of kabbalah. The comforting news is that you don't need to read Hebrew any better than some Tibetan lamas can read Sanskrit (and they are still excellent magicians). Please understand I don't propose to teach you kabbalah in this book. This short chapter merely sets forth the special characteristics of our version of kabbalah. You can famil- iarize yourself with the grand old system in the works I've recom- mended in the study guide. With this in mind let's look briefly at what I call \"The Kabbalah of Wizardry.\" It was developed in the late middle ages and early renaissance by nominally Christian magicians and is usually refered to as \"The Hermetic Kabbalah\". How does it differ from Rabbinical Kabbalah and just how \"Pagan\", how \"Gnostic\" or how \"Judeao- Christian\" is it? These questions may not seem important at this point but they will loom large as you begin a serious study of the subject, so I will do my best to answer them as briefly and as simply as I can right at the outset of your training. Let us begin by attempting a one sentence definition of Kabbalah. Kabbalah is a philosophical-mathematicaL-geometric system that describes the creation and operation of the universe through four dimensions by employing a schematic design containing ten spheres of descending emanation connected by twenty-two paths attributed to letters of the alphabet and their numerical equivalents. This is a starting point but not much better than giving weight, height and color as the defmition for an elephant. Essential to under- standing kabbalah is the concept of Ain Soph, \"The Limitless Nothing\" that contracts into itself and produces the Ain Soph Aur, \"The Limitless Light\", which then expands to produce The Universe and continues to enliven and to ensoul it. This conception predates modem physics' \"Big Bang Theory\" by a thousand years. It also puts Kabbalistc phi- losophy in a very controversial position in relation to orthodox Jewish 57"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"and Christian religion. At the highest level the kabbalist can conceive, God is not judgmental or in any way dissatisfied with His Creation. He simply Is and continues to Be. A contemporary popular analogy would be \"The Force\" in the Lucas STAR WARS films. The Universe is therefore operated by lesser, more differentiat- ed personifications such as Angels, Gods, Goddesses and Elemental Spirits. This idea was originally Neoplatonic (the philosophical high water mark of Classical Paganism) and can be explored further in the writings of the philosopher Plotinus and his followers. We attribute all these lesser powers to the various Spheres and Paths of the Tree of Life structure described in our one sentence defi- nition. We can then access them for knowledge or for help. Thinking of it in a more subjective way, we might say that kab- balah is a spiritual-magical computer program for your mind. It inter- faces the left and right hemispheres of the brain (a modem physiolog- ical reality originally theorized by the kabbalist, Issac Luria in the 16th century) and allows you to go on-line with \"The Great Main- frame\". In other words, the Microcosm (you) accesses the Macrocosm (God). Since its emergence in medieval southern France and Spain to the present era, kabbalah (especially magical kabbalah) has been stud- ied and practiced by as many Gentiles as Jews. In fifteenth century Europe a philosophical marriage took place that established the lineage of The Western Esoteric Tradition. Hebrew Kabbalah was united with Classical Paganism (Hermeticism). Hermetic philosophy had arisen in the second century of the Christian era as an attempt to preserve the ancient wisdom from the anti- intel- lectual onslaught of Christian zealots. It combined elements of Neoplatonic, Gnostic and Orphic teachings. When the Hermetic writ- ings were rediscovered by Renaissance Europeans, magick was liter- ally reborn. Hebrew Kabbalah, which shared many of the same origi- nal roots, was soon iritegrated into the Hermetic scheme to give it a necessary structure. 58"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"Humanist \"Hermetic\" philosophers enriched their magical art by including the Pagan Orphic Hymns to the Gods and drawing on the exotic Arabian-Sabian 1. planetary magical system (having origins in ancient Canaan and Babylon) to create an elegant synthesis. The Earth was declared a Goddess (the Anima Mundi ). The deified Sun, Moon and planets were evoked both in the human body and in the heavens beyond. This obviously Pagan, capricious and amoral pantheon was balanced and regulated by Angelic counterparts retained from the Biblical system. However, in the Hermetic Kabbalah these Angels were thought of as the sentient messengers or special power-givers not of a \"Biblical Jehovah\" but of an omnipresent, omnipotent and non- judgmental \"Force\" that flowed throughout the universe. The famous Renaissance philosopher magician, Giordano Bruno, who was suppos- edly burned at the stake for supporting Copernicus's heliocentric the- ory, was actually executed by the Inquisition not because he publicly declared that \"Yes, the earth does revolve around the Sun\" - but because he then insisted that\" the Sun is a God!\" Kabbalah, in its earliest form, was probably derived from a syn- thesis of Pythagorean mathematical/geometric philosophy and Simonian (Samaritan) Gnosticism in first century Palestine and Alexandria. Its Palestinian roots are shrouded in myth but we can make an argument for a Pagan Samaritan origin. 2. In its later Hermetic form the practical (magical) kabbalah is similar to Tibetan Tantric Buddhism in that elaborate visualizations of frankly Pagan godforms, angels and elemental spirits are encouraged. Judaic and Muslim religious tradition forbids this imagery, thus severely handicapping their forms of kabbalah. 3. There is, however, one major difference between our Hermetic system and that of the tantrics: they contend that everything is ultimately illusion whereas we say that everything is ultimately reality. For this reason we place great emphasis on developing and balancing the four philosophical \"Elements\": Fire, Air, Water and Earth (animated by \"The Force\" which we call \"Spirit'i.) 59"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"In Hermetic-kabbalistic terms, these Four Elements are the man- ifestation of The Tetragrammaton, the four-fold Name of God. They are further personified by the Four Archangels of the Quarters with which you are already familiar. The importance of these Four Magical Elements (which are also the Grail Hallows and the Tarot suits) cannot be overemphasized. I need not press my argument further than to refer the student to one of our major beginning texts, Initiation into Hermetics by Franz Bardon. This entire work is devoted to the mastery of these four principles. Hermetic kabbalah also employs Angelic balancing forces as invoking and evoking formulas to call down and summon up its other- wise Pagan entities. There should be no disrespect or irreverence toward ancient deities in this process. It is the traditional source of the magician's power. The Arts of Theurgy and Thaumaturgy 4. allow you to explore vast dream realms and discover lost treasures of spirit. One might say that the worshiping mystic waits on the whim of his god while the magician sets out to climb Mount Olympus. If you are a spiritual adventurer the respectful manipulation of these forces will be the appropriate method for you. You now have a beginning idea of what Hermetic kabbalah is about but you may still wonder how it differs from traditional Jewish kabbalah. It differs in three ways. First: Jewish kabbalah is primarily con- cerned with decoding the first five books of the Bible via the process of Gematria (each Hebrew letter has a number value; hence any other word adding up to the same value has a mystic relation or could be a coded substitution). Second: Jewish kabbalah (of the most esoteric Lurianic school) does postulate a non-judgmental god-force at the highest level but becomes highly moralistic in descending levels - and, Third: Jewish Kabbalah has nothing to do with the Tarot or any Pagan godforms on The Tree of Life. By the eighteenth century the Jewish intellectual establishment had generally abandoned kabbalah as a \"baleful influence\" on their 60"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"culture - although, in recent years there has been a revival of interest in the subject in the Jewish community (especially in the in the nin- teen sixties and seventies when the rabbis discovered that some of their brightest young people were attracted to esoteric Buddhism). This his- torical background is mentioned so that the reader will be aware that there are distinctly different conceptions and philosophies of kabbal- ah. There is no \"Official Kabbalah\", there is only the kabbalah that is right for you. We should also mention that our particular O.T.A. version of the Hermetic kabbalah uses Phoenician Letters instead of Hebrew (see Figure 5. and Phoenician Alphabet Appendix) and that we use a non- Judaic Tetragrammaton in lieu of YHVH. 5. Where does Jesus fit into all of this? Was there ever any such thing as a \"Christian Kabbalah\"? There were some attempts at this during Renaissance but Christianity's Doctrine of Faith is fundamentally opposed to the kab- balah's Doctrine of Knowledge (Gnosis) and Christianity's triune structure will not fit into the ten spheres of the Otz Chiim (Tree of Life). If you are eclectic you can place Jesus in Tiphareth (along with Ba'al and Osiris) but you should be aware that this is not an elegant assignment because there are no other deities in any \"Christian pan- theon\" whom you can then place in the other Sephiroth. The Apostles won't fit and the Saints aren't appropriate. (Conversely, ancient Semitic Pagan deities fit so perfectly on The Tree that one might think that the kabbalah was secretly designed for their eventual return! Modem archaeological research by Prof. Simo Parpola, presented in his article The Assyrian Tree of Life from The Journal of Near Eastern Studies (1994), supports this view, estab- lishing that the original ten sphere \"Tree\" was attributed to the Gods and Goddesses of ancient Mesopotamia -- which were nearly cognate with our Canaanite pantheon -- and which were imported into ancient Israel after the Assyrian conquest with the forced resettlement of the Samaritans.

We do not invoke Christ in our rituals because He does not fit into the Hermetic system. He would not be comfortable having to share importance with our ancient Gods and Goddesses or even the Angels that empower the Four Elements. If you consider Jesus to have been the chosen representative of God among Men, you should let Him stand alone. At this juncture we need to explain how the kabbalah relates to our Goetia and Almadel systems. The best way to understand these relationships is to study the Tree of Life diagram (Figure 5.) and try to visualize the conceptions. The Tree of Life (Otz Chiim) is a philosophical schematic of the universe as it was created and as it continues to function. The Tree has ten Spheres because we have ten fingers and our mathematics is based on the number ten. We separate The Tree into four descending Olams or dimensions. (In an over-simplified way these dimensions can be thought of as levels of vibration or frequency, like UHF, VHF, etc.) At the top we have Atziluth, the World of Origins, which creates and con- tains the single Sephera of Kether. At this exalted level God is nei- ther male or female and certainly not judgmental. This is \"The Force\" which empowers the mighty two-stroke engine of the next dimension, Olam Briah, the World of Archetypes and Archangels, where the Yin- Yang (the Sephiroth of Chockmah and Binah, male/positive- female/negative) revolves with impersonal, cyclical detachment, gen- erating the myriad pre-forms of the Olam Yetzirah, the Olam of Formation, the so-called \"Astral Plane\". (This derives from Plato, who originated the idea of \"The Original Idea\"; the concept that there has to be an \"ideal archetype\" preceding every physical manifestation. The Neoplatonists then made these ideal forms dynamic through the theory of emantions.) These \"pre-forms\" become physically manifest- ed in the [mal Olam, Asshia, which contains the single Sephera of Malkuth. 63"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"The Yetziratic dimension, wherein the magician does most of his or her work, comprises the Sephirotb from Chesed down to Yesod. Here we find the anthropomorphic and zoomorphic images of mythol- ogy. This is the Realm of the Gods that Carl Jung called \"The Collective Unconscious\" and here we will find the Genii of King Solomon's Brass Vessel. .. . . . Well, not exactly ... The truth is that all of King Solomon's Spirits are found in the lowest Sephera of the Astral, the lunar sphere of Yesod. This is the case even though they are attributed to all the planets from Mercury (Hod) on up to Saturn (Binah). We have what appears to be a paradox as a result of trying to explain Kabbalah in one short chapter. The Tree of Life design serves different functions. In the description above (and on Fig. 5) we use the Four Olam Division on one single Tree to show the process of cre- ation. Be aware, however, that each of the Four Dimensions operate throughout the whole Tree and each Sephera contains its own com- plete Tree. We find all of Solomon's Genii in the various planetary spheres of Yesod because Yesod is gateway to the Astral, the sphere of memory and the sphere of The Dark Mirror. If this sounds confusing, try to visualize it this way: The Moon is the planetary sphere closest to the Earth (in kabbalistic terms, Yesod is the sephira closest to Malkuth). The outer planets and the sun are reflected down through it. Coming up from below, it is our port of entry into the subconscious emotional Astral Plane (Olam Yetzirah). Thus the lunar 'mirror and memory aspects' of Yesod are very appro- priate because the Goetia spirits are, in a psychological sense, all reflections of different aspects of yourself extended out in a flat circle on this primal, emotional level. \"Observe the Moon in all thy workings\" the Lemegeton declares. Given the above, your next question should be which Archangels control these Goetia Spirits? Obviously Gabriel rules Yesod and should be invoked in a Greater (lunar-planetary) 64"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"Septagram Ritual preceding every Goetic operation. Remember, the 72 Spirits of the Brass Vessel are not an ascending hierarchy and nei- ther are the four Archangels of the Quarters and the 72 Angels of the Shemhamephorash 6. who control the 72 Goetic spirits. They are all in a flat circular pattern following the signs of the zodiac (see the Master Mandala). You may note another apparent paradox with the four Archangels of the Quarters and the Elements also doubling as four of the seven planetary Archangels. Kabbalistc hair-splitters will tell you they are actually different beings with the same names. You may find it necessary, at a certain stage of your development, to go along with this. Eventually you will internalize the Archangels as principles (e. g., Raphael personifies the illuminating Sun in the Eastern Quadrant and the life-giving properties of the Air). Recall my Metatron-H.G.A.- Sandal phon angelic Totem Pole. These angels are not attributed to the planets in any context. Once you have raised such ancient deities as Ba' al, Astarte, Amon- Ra or Horus through their Goetia forms via the Lunar Gate, you may certainly seek them in their higher spheres under their original titles in proper planetary operations. (The Picatrix provides an excel- lent resource for such advanced workings.) Remember, the ancient Gods and Goddesses are capricious, like the forces of nature they rep- resent. Balance your work carefully. Considering the above the thoughtful student might ask if Hermetic-kabbalistic magick is an amoral system? It is not possible to give a quick and simple \"No\" answer to this question. One reason is that there is nothing quick and simple about kabbalah. Another reason is that without certain philosophical princi- ples such as reincarnation, the Law of Karma and the belief that spir- itual evolvement requires one to transcend personal ego and find com- passion for all humankind, Hermetic kabbalah could be seriously mis- used. 65"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"For this reason we follow the example of Hermes Trismegistus and keep the teachings as a prize to be won by seekers after wisdom, not a gospel to be preached to multitudes. (So, if you find this chap- ter a little difficult to understand, without parallel reading, you should realize that we are following that principle - and you will be encour- aged to study the recommended texts.) If this brief theoretical explanation raises as many questions as it answers, we are at least off to a good start ... Now let's take a quick look at the practical kabbalistic aspects of a Goetic operation: - After opening the Lunar Gate (Yesod) with a Planetary Septagram Ritual, during which you will internally expand The Tree of Life in Yesod (located in the genital chakra) to displace and overlay the other psychic centers in your body (see Chapter Nine, Figure 7.), you will then circumambulate your magick circle deosil as many turns as the number of the Sephira you are working (e. g., seven times for the Sphere of Netzach). Likewise, in a Yesod-Netsach operation you would use green candles and bum sandlewood incense. The Names of Power that you plug into your standard conjuration are drawn from The Master Mandala and the 777 references to the Sphere of your working. You will also use the proper planetary metal (or an affordable facsimile) for the spirit's lamen worn by the receiver. As you can see, there is psycho-technical structure to Solomon's Magick that is definitely kabbalistic. This does not mean that you have to master all the theoretical principles and practical methods of this venerable philosophy before you venture into wizardry. The fact is you will never master it all. One of the more important things you will learn from the study of kabbalah and the practice of magick is the vast extent of what you really do not know. The more you study and prac- tice the greater, deeper and further this unknowing extends. Remember this when someone tries to tell you how much they 'know' or how much 'you do not know' about kabbalah. 7. 66"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"Chapter !Fivel9{ptes: 1. This little-known Pagan Sabian connection is vitally important in the history of Western Magick. The Harranian scheme of planetary correspondences reached the European magi through the medieval Arabic grimoire, Picatrix, which has not yet been completely translated in English. In the O.T.A. we use a private translation of the Sabian Planetary Prayers made by the Master of our East Coast Temple, Frater Sabezius, who has specialized in this ancient Pagan school of magick. 2. The possibility of a Samaritan origin for the Kabbalah has been carefully side-stepped by Jewish writers. The Samaritans were Babylonian Pagans who were resettled in Israel by the Assyrians after their conquest of Palestine in 721 B.C. From that time on through to the Christian era they practiced a mix- ture of Pagan and Jewish religious traditions that was more magical than orthodox Judaism. They may have originated the concept of Gematria (see Wallis Budge's AMULETS AND TAL- ISMANS). One of the great progenitors of our Hermetic tradi- tion, the Gnostic magician Simon Magus, was a Samaritan. The Samaritan 22 letter alphabet is directly analogous to Hebrew and, like the earlier Phoenician characters, is a good choice for Hermetic Pagan magicians who prefer not to use Hebrew. 3. Muslim kabbalah is called Abjad after the first five letters of the Arabic alphabet. 4. As Issac Bonewitz pointed out during our 1974 presentation on NBC's Tom Snyder Show, Theurgy means \"Divine Working\" whereas Thaumaturgy translates as \"Miracle Working\". From this we can deduce that the expression \"Goetic Theurgy\" is actually a contradiction in terms. 5. YHVH means \"I Am What I Am\". It is an anagram for some thing unknown like V.FO. or Y.I.P. Regardless of this ambig- uous symbolism it has very strong religious connotations. If you are Jewish or an Old Testament oriented Christian, you should probably continue to use it. Modem Hermetic Pagans may find AMShO - derived from the Three Mother Letters of the Sepher Yetzirah, plus Omega - less \"Biblical\" in the negative sense (even Hebrew kabbalists conceded that their alphabet needed another letter). However, if you don't want to add another letter to the Phoenician or Samaritan alphabet for the Earth Element, you might also consider my ShMAT 9{ptes continued on next page . . . 67"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"Chapter :Fivel9{ptes continued: (Sha Mah Ah Tah ) formula, Shin (Fire!Atziluth) Mem (WaterlBriah) Aleph (YetzirahlAir) Tau (Satum-Earth- Malkuth).

Even if you do not agree with the new Hermetic forms you are sure to profit from a serious study in preparation to challenge them. 6. The Shemhamephorash (extended name of God) that is used in our Master Mandalla is the version derived from the 72 word verses in Exodus, not from the permutation of YHVH via the Tetrakis referred to in my kabbalah research paper included in Appendix 4. 7.

An example in point is the present large-scale misuse of Regardie's Watchtower Opening. For many years Francis Regardie had let it be known that he had developed a ritual to open the four Enochian Elemental Tablets and the Tablet of Union for Temple working. He finally got a chance to publish the rite in 1980 but the publisher suggested that, for marketing purposes, the book should be presented as introductory. Of course it was anything but introductory. In order to make the procedure accessible to beginning students, Regardie suggested they might use the sigils on the tops of the Tablets rather than put off performing the rite until they had a full set of boards constructed - even though they were certainly expected to visualize The Tablets as being \"in place.\" After Regardie's death his simplified substitution was inappropriately reduced to the use of generic elemen- tal symbols (e.g., L1 = Fire) at the quarters. We ended up with an exclusively Enochian procedure to open Enochian Watchtowers which were neither present nor even understood to be activated on the astral. This ritual is now being offered by its proponents as a \"Basic Temple Opening\" for all Hermetic operations. This is acceptable only under the agreed upon condition that the ultimate architecture of the Spiritual Universe is Enochian. Of course it can be if the student chooses to accept it but he or she deserves the opportunity to make that choice at a point in the curriculum where the philosophical impli- cations are understood. This is especially true for practitioners who are not Thelemites (followers of Aleister Crowley) or advanced students of the Golden Dawn. As the French have learned, it is not prudent to serve wine to children.\" I have dealt with this Enochian issue at some length above in order to make a point: the AlmadellGoetia system is not Enochian. Granted that Thomas Rudd, and later Aleister Crowley, both made attempts to integrate the two systems - but they did not succeed. I would strongly advise students not to mix AlmadellGoetia with Enochian until you feel you are ready to pick up where Rudd and 70"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"Crowley left off, realizing that you would be undertaking a project that daunted two of the most brilliant magical scholars of the last 300 years. With the Enochian question thus temporarily put by, let us pro- ceed to the basic architecture of the Almadel and Goetia systems as they have come down to us and as they have been interpreted in mod- em times. First, the Almadel: - The Almadel Angels are not arranged in a descending hierarchy but rather attributed to the four elemental signs of the zodiac - which represent the true quarters (or Watchtowers if you will) of The Universe. The original Almadel attributes five Angels to each \"Altitude\" (i.e., three signs of the same element). The number five in this case is either erroneous, arbitrary or based on Agrippa's numerology, and the names of the Angels are hopelessly garbled. One literally has to dismantle and reconstruct the system to make it work the way I believe it was originally intended to function. Instead of five Angels per \"Altitude\", we fall back on the Traditional DirectionallElemental Guardians of the Four Quarters: Raphael, Michael, Gabriel and Auriel. Each of these Great Heads then direct three sets of six Shemhamephorash Angels - the 72 direct counterparts of the Goetia Spirits who are, appropriately enough, gov- erned by Four Kings attributed to the same Four Quarters. The fmal proof of the system's validity is in its elegance. If the Almadel was not originally conceived this way, it certainly should have been. Now to the Goetia: - The first thing we have to deal with in considering where and how to arrange our 72 Spirits is the Art/Science of Astrology. Here we basically have two choices, Tropical or Sidereal. We can start our series off at 0 0 Aries (as we and most others have done with the Goetia 2.) and forget any precise celestial positioning, or we can anchor our circle of Spirits at 0 0 Leo, following the Golden Dawn system, forever fixing them in the heavens. This is what the Golden Dawn did with its version of the Shemhamephorash Angels. 71"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"Either system is valid. You can also have it both ways if you feel, as one of my respected colleagues does, that adherence to Golden Dawn and Thelemic traditions demand the astrological compromise - just so long as you understand what that compromise involves ... 3. If your Spirits start at 0 0 Aries and your Shemhamephorash Angels start at 0 0 Leo, they simply will not match up. The Angels are fixed and the Spirits are sliding backwards. The reason why the Golden Dawn left us with this unresolved problem was simply that they considered the Shemhamephorash Angels as part of their official (Sidereal) system but consigned the Goetia Spirits to an unofficial sub- system which they did not incorporate. This is why the Goetia Demons are left in their Tropical sequence. It is also the reason why the G.D., and later Crowley, never corrected the cumbersome and poorly justified \"Day and Night Demon\" arrangement listed in 777. This scheme treats each 10 0 Decan as a 24 hour period (?) in an attempt to untangle the ponderous and garbled instructions in the Goetia. These directions seem to derive from Planetary Hours, the Mansions of the Moon and Agrippa's numerological superstitions about \"good and bad numbers\". If the logic behind all this escapes you, you are not alone. Nobody else has been able to figure it out. 4. Just remember this: because all Goetia Spirits are \"Fallen Angels\", they reside in the lower astral or Lunar Sphere (Yesod). They are one ring of an onion with the Shemhamephorash in another ring beyond them. It is best to summon them during a waxing moon because of the moon's influence on emotions (remember the astral plane is also the emotional plane), otherwise you can contact anyone them any time you wish. In line with the above I have taken the liberty to start our Shemhamephorash Angels off at 0 0 Aries, linking them directly with our Goetia Spirits - But we also use MacGregor Mathers' sigils which the G.D. employed in their Sidereal sequence. How do we jus- tify this ? Very easily: Mathers claimed that he got the sigils from \"The Great Magician, Blaise Viginaire.\" Now if anybody could prove that 72"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"Blaise Viginaire started his Shemhamephorash off at 0 0 Leo we might have a problem - but, like the traditional Goetia, the chances are overwhelming that they were originally fixed on 0 0 Aries. We have made one switch in the Sloane 2731 Goetia Spirit num- ber sequence. Astaroth # 29 (Astarte) has changed places with Stolas # 36. This has been done for symbolic and philosophical reasons which should be become apparent when looking at our Master Mandala. You will note that this assignment puts The Queen of Heaven (Astarte) at The Autumn Equinox Point directly opposite The Prince of Earth (Ba' al) at Vernal Equinox and places Her under the aegis of Auriel, in the Sign of Virgo, The Harvest Maiden (Zodiacal Icon of The Goddess) and also locates Her in the Decan of ~ (Venus). Along with this you may also note that Ba' al (Bael) heads the list at 0° Y(Aries), a fire sign under King Goap, whereas the Goetia calls him \"a King ruling in The East\", thus placing him under Amaymon. In the video I conjured him under Amaymon because the sequence was a re-creation of my first operation. Actually he comes through stronger in the Southern Quarter under Michael and Goap in the Decan of cf (Mars). At this point a perceptive Golden Dawn student will realize that our main reason for keeping the system in its tropical form rather than rectifying in the sidereal mode is this frankly religious seasonal equinox factor mentioned above. If you understand everything we have discussed in this chapter and you feel you would rather have a mandala with all spirits and angels anchored on 0 0 Q (Leo), please be encouraged to construct one - as one of my G.D. colleagues is already in the process of doing at this writing. From a philosophical point of view the preceding technical dis- sertation serves mainly to prove the implicit converse of the Hermetic axiom, As Above, So Below. It is true that the Western magician - who considers everything, imagined or envisioned to be real - needs a fully integrated magical universe that extends infInitely in all direc- 73"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"tions (the Tree of Life and the Cube of Space), whereas my Tibetan teachers, who considered everything to be illusion, could handle several technically contradictory systems so long as they were philo- sophically harmonious. So, am I imposing an Eastern perspective onto Western magick with the unique synthesis of the Master Mandala? In one sense I am and in another I am not. When faced with the problem of standing an egg on end, the anecdotal Columbus did not declare the egg to be an illusion that could be imagined in any position desired, he just picked the egg up and cracked the end so it would stand up by itself. This is basically what I have done with the Goetial Almadel and some other barnacle encrusted aspects of our Western Tradition. To present another example, wouldn't it be nice if we had a real Western psychic center (chakra) system? Straighten out the Lightning Flash (Flaming Sword) on the Tree of Life and you have one! (See The Hermetic Caduceus and our Septagram Ritual in this book and also my demonstration in the video.) Tibetans and the Rosicrucians are both right! Everything is real and nothing is true - and every combination of this sentence is valid and not valid. E.g., Nothing is real and everything is true or everything is true and nothing is real. The only real (or true) difference between Tibetans and Western magicians is that we play our game on a much bigger chess board and often fmd ourselves checkmated behind our own pieces before we ever reach the end-game stage. This handicap is most often caused by our superstitious reluctance to sweep out the errors and contradictions accumulated over the centuries and repro- gram our universal sending and receiving apparatus according to basic Hermetic philosophical principles. Therefore, if we need to be formal about it, let us call The Master Mandala an example of a Subjective Radial Spiritus Theory based on the following argument: The human mind inherits a variety of internal regulating systems subject to external influences, e.g., the 74"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"biological clock, the lunar menstrual cycle and the innate structure for language grammar. Exterior operative systems may also be imposed upon it much like the computer programming process, e.g., musical, linguistic, artistic, athletic and mathematical disciplines. Such new systems are acceptable to the mind because they are themselves mental constructs that can be understood and implemented by other minds. There is and must always be a structuralism involved in this process. The mind gen- erates structures and systems, such as hierarchies, emanations, pro- gressions and permutations because it (the mind) emulates the greater universe which it continually observes and even creates. Chaos is inevitable but the mind and the universe will always revert to structure, seeking out the simplest, most efficient and elegant operative procedure for perception and cognition even if such con- structs are arbitrably perceived and imposed. A bumble bee cannot fly and the internal combustion engine should not work as well as it does - but both function excellently because the Greater Universe and the Human Mind desire that they do.

Remember, the spirits of the Lunar Sphere (Yesod) surround your personal horizon. You are the Navigator of the Inner Planes. Before Rene Decarte's separation of subjective and objective perceptions became dogma Hermetic magi artfully constructed new spiritual models of the cosmos that could be accepted and operated through the mental structuring process described above. Given the \"As Above, So Below\" maxim, such constructs, if philosophically consis- tent, were entirely functional. An example of such an operative mag- ical universe would be the Enochian system of Dr Dee and Edward Kelley. Enochian magick, like Athena, sprang full-armed from the brow of Zeus, whereas the older, and to this day more widely used, 75"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"Goetia system was recopied by inept scribes, bowdlerized and distort- ed until it became a hodgepodge of contradictory instructions and arbi- trary assignments. But I could not help thinking that the Goetia was once as ele- gantly and philosopically constructed as Dee and Kelley's system. With that in mind, and my awareness of the sadly disorganized entourage that has come down to us, I did what any Renaissance magus worth his salt would have done: I consulted the Demon Kings of the Quadrants themselves -- King Goap, of the Southern Fire Quadrant, cut the Gordian knot straight away: \" ... A magician should rearrange the order of his spirits so that those with the same or simi- lar elemental characteristics come under the rulership of the signs appropriate to their nature. \" Well, what could be simpler than that? He went on to explain that this was what was actually meant by sealing the rebellious spirits in the Vessel of Brass. This operation opened a floodgate of understanding. I went quickly to Bardon's INITIATION INTO HERMETICS and reviewed the classical characteristics of Hermetic Elements, and then I returned to THE GOETIA armed with a clear vision of what was needed. In a sur- prisingly short time I had all 72 sorted out into four sets of 18 spirits, each attributed to one of the four primal elements, astrological triplic- ities and directional quadrants. I continued the process and assigned each spirit to a specific astrological sign. Taking the final step, I then matched, and in some cases changed, the planetary ranks (Marquis = ce) to agree with the planets ruling the decans. Following the plane- tary attributes of the decans, this produced a balanced system of six solar spirits, six lunar spirits and twelve spirits for each of the five planets, all corresponding exactly to traditional astrology. What has re-emerged here is the system as I believe it was orig- inally constructed.

Thus we are leaving the Master Mandala in its first stage of rectification but be aware that as such it is a \"rough ashlar\" that obviously needs perfect- ing. When you have taken your Mandala to the third stage of rectifica- tion, you may call yourself a Goetial Almadel Master. So now you have your work cut out for you. Good Magick! In the spirit of Renaissance Hermeticism we have thus rectified the Goetia, integrated it with an equally rectified Almadel and Shemhamephorash, to produce a complete and balanced system of practice. As long as you understand that the Angels and the Spirits communicate with you through your mind, you will have no difficul- ty making contact with them, and they will find it easier to get through to you, using this system.

Before accepting the Enochian system as the architecture of one's personal magical universe I would suggest reading and thoughtfully meditating upon Don Tyson's article, THE ENOCHIAN APOCALYPSE in the Summer 1996 issue of GNOSIS. I do not agree with Tyson that working Enochian could in any way precipitate The Apocalypse on a macrocosmic scale but an obsession with Enochian might be likened to the opening of Pinhead's Puzzle Box in your own microcosmic universe. 2. In their 1975 book The Sword and the Serpent, Melita Denning and Osborne Phillips published four pages of hand written notes purporting to be a Goetia arrangement. This sequence starts in the first odd numbered quinance (5° division or one half of a decan) of Leo (as per the Golden Dawn Sid- ereal system) and continues through the Spirit list in odd num- bered slots, then starts over again with the even numbered se- quence but in Aries rather than Leo!

This is a very valuable package and highly recom- mended as the authoritative (Thelemic & G.D.) traditional alternative to my radical innovations. The DuQuettes do not use our optical mirror/facial distortion method in Goetia opera- tions but they have considerable respect for it. If you are going to be a Goetia/Almadel magician you should certainly study their work along with Frater Hymenaeus Beta's excellent 2nd edition of Crowley's 1904 GOETIA (also from Weiser). 3. Ours is not the first published rectification of the Goetia on a straight quinance sequence. In 1988 Llewellyn offered a Goetia \"divination\" card deck, and accompanying book, both created by Priscilla Schwei. In spite of its obvious attempt to trivialize and commercialize a ceremonial system the Schwei book and card set represents a genuine effort to reconstruct the Goetia along astrological lines. She properly rejected the 777 day and night demon arrangement in favor of a straight pro- gression and then correctly divided the 72 Spirits into astrolog- ical quatrinaries. However, she did not attribute her Quarter divisions to the traditional Kings and Archangels but rather to the Heavenly Orders from which some of the spirits claimed to have fallen. Only four out of the 15 citing such a heavenly ori- gin matched up in her arrangement. This idea was philosophi- cally flawed in any case and resulted in a moral discrepancy. Because of the heavenly origin of all these \"Fallen Angels\" (whom she had earlier stated were of ancient Egyptian origin), they were supposed to be able to police themselves and would not permit the operator to engage in black magick. If Schwei had published the traditional descriptions of the spirits (espe- cially those who cause running sores crawling with worms) I doubt that anyone could have taken this idea seriously. 4. Trying to find some logical order in the descriptions of the Goetia spirits from MS 2731 can be an exhaustive and exasper- ating task. No matter how one arranges the existing sequence, the ones who are supposed to appear in Sagittarius do not and one who is supposed to be under Amaymon cannot be shifted to that quarter without displacing two of his minions who are 9{ptes continued on 1W(j: page ... 78"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"Chapter SiJ(!

The multi-level implications of this Arabian folk-tale (with its Biblical ori- gins) - which was a major operative cosmology behind medieval cer- emonial magick before the rise (or descent) of the perverted 'Faustian School'- should be fascinating to Jungian and even Freudian psy- chologists. From a kabbalistic standpoint, the seventy-two spirits of the traditional Goetia are a significant corollary to the seventy-two let- ters of the extended Name of God, the SHEMHAMEPHORASH, from which the names of seventy-two Angels can be derived, implying an inseparable duality of 'good' and 'evil' throughout the entire celestial- infernal pantheon. 80"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"Considering this in light of the micro-macrocosm dogma, we are presented with the concept of seventy-two greater and lesser bipolar archetypes functioning in the collective and personal unconscious. The Brass Vessel - aside from its obvious 'yoni' symbolism- then rep- resents the receptacle of the controlled and organized psyche. The rebellious spirits are summoned to appear by the power of Tetragrammaton 1. (the ultimate cathexis ), required to render service in accordance with their particular capabilities and then consigned to bondage in the 'Brass Vessel' where they can cause no harm and from whence they can be readily called upon when needed. The psy- chotherapeutic analogy in the above is inescapable. (We will discuss the philosophical symbolism of the Triangle of Art wherein such enti- ties are commanded to appear in The Documentary Appendix .) This then is the crux of the Solomonic system of magick: pride, passion, greed and hatred cannot be divorced from their intrinsic coun- terparts, humility, purity, charity and love. They can only be organized and controlled as essential factors of the balanced personality - a sophisticated internalized concept that seems paradoxical with the popular image of the robed and hooded demonologist intoning his \"infernal conjurations\". But why did the Arab Doctors attribute this system to Solomon and why do we, the foremost modem practitioners of it, call ourselves the Order of the Temple Astarte? The answer to both questions can be found in the Bible. In 1st Kings, Chapter 11, we read that Solomon followed Ashtoreth (the Goddess Astarte), \"the abomination of the Sidonians.\" If we put the Biblical account in a broader perspective, we realize that the patriarchal Levite sect of Yahweh was in constant, bit- ter conflict with the Ba' al-Astarte cult of Canaan. Now it should be understood that the Religion of Moses was a sect derived from the same mythos as its rival. . Abraham, a Babylonian ofUr, had been blessed by Melchizedek the Canaanite King of Jerusalem and a priest of EL, \"The Most High God (Genesis, Chapter 14 ) This same EL was the father of Ba' al and 81"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"Astarte. In Babylon EL was called AND and was the father of Ishtar. Space does not permit us speculation on all the factors that aided the growth of the austere Religion of Yahweh but the hard, nomadic, eth- nocentric life of the Hebrews was certainly one of the foremost. When this wandering branch of the Amorite people returned 'home' to Canaan they began the transition from pastoral tribesmen to agricul- turalists and urbanites. Before the time of Saul and David, the religious battle lines were drawn. Joshua's attempted genocide of the Canaanites had not been successful and they still \"abounded in the land\". The new farmers were naturally attracted to the nature-oriented intensification rituals of Ba' al, and their newly urbanized brethren were fascinated with the sensual glamour of Astarte's saturnalian rites. It was probably at this point that the first puritanical \"blue laws\" of orthodox Judaism appeared . .During the Empire of Solomon, the socioeconomic transition was complete but the religious conflict had not resulted in a synthesis. Instead we look back on two spiritually unbalanced cults fighting for supremacy. The transvestite priest of Astarte finding final exaltation in publicly castrating himself is hardly more odious than the Levite priest demanding a young woman be stoned to death for adultery or exacting a ruinous judgment from a poor farmer struggling to save his precious harvest by working on the Sabbath. Was Solomon attempting, by his catholic example, to bring about a mellow fusion of these separate cults of EL's progeny into a pansemitic polymorphous monotheism similar to the Hindu religion of India? He may well have built the magnificent Temple at Jerusalem not only for the Levite Yahweh but for the universal overgod of all the Semites. 2. Why else would Hiram of Tyre, a Pagan Phoenician (as had been Melchizedek), \"rejoice\" and say \"Blessed be the Lord\" before assisting Solomon so readily? (lst Kings, Chap. 5.)

How much more awesome it must have been in times when the sanctified celebrants and their congregation believed utterly in the truth. of Divine Possession? One need only compare the Great Rite in its full ancient significance to the Transfor- mation Miracle of the Paulian Mass (an indirect and passive assumption of god-form) to realize why the Art of Magick has been feared and suppressed for so many centuries in the West. A solar cult that castrates its god and transforms his bride into a \"Virgin Mother\" cannot compete magically with a virile and fertile 501- Terra mythos. Even though the Paulians adapted Pagan festivals, embraced anthropomorphism and deified a vast pantheon of saints, their system has no direct, creative link with the deepest and most basic forces that energize Humans and Nature.

Not only would such a renunciation be injurious to the personal egragore, it is historically unjustified; Jesus never claimed he was God and should not be blamed for the acts of those who posthu- mously deify him. A study of elementary Kabbalah will quickly resolve any difficulties in understanding this Rosicrucian view and lead the student to a full grasp of the significance of what the Master did say: \"I am the son of Man.\" Further study and meditation may even lead to a revelation of the link between Jesus and Melchizedek- But to return to our subject ... A convincing argument for the actual exis- tence of a Solomonic proto Magical tradition such as we have described above, can be found in The Song of Solomon itself, where- in the mysterious \"Shulamite\" thrice declares: \"I charge you, oh daughters of Jerusalem, stir not up nor awake my love, until he please.\" This Psalm may well be a hymn to the Queen of Heaven. Perhaps it is the culture-memory of that Magical Religion Solomon tried to create that comes down to us in the ancient systems of thaumatergy and theurgy the Arabians attributed to him? The essen- tial polymorphism of Magick with its rich pantheon of Phoenician, Babylonian and Egyptian entities as personalized male and female aspects of the Tetragrammaton - an all-pervading, transsexual life- force, moral only in its impersonal harmony - is a far more 'EL' ish conception than the paternal and patriarchal God of Moses. It might be considered a cosmic joke that the great EL survived only as one of the many names attributed to His nomadic step-son and that His daughter, The Fair Astarte, was transformed into Astaroth , a male demon with bad breath! In the words of Khayyam (out of con- text) \"Many a cup of this forbidden wine will drown the memory of that insolence.\"- and Solomon's Magick is indeed a forbidden wine.

As Wilhelm Reich theorized and the later Soviet social experiments proved, the power of authoritarianism depends largely on its ability to channel the sexual drives of its subjects. The ancient Pagan establishment maintained such control by sanctifying the sex act with its official priestesses, while the Hebrews, later the Paulians and frnally the Communists decided to make a 'sin' out of it. Needless to say, both extremes are insults to freedom and dignity. As a corollary to this sexual negation, the Hebrew (and later Muslim) prohibition against graven images, especially anthropomor- phic ones, was not imposed from any desire to promote a concept of pure monotheism - as is usually supposed - but rather to restrict the practice of Magick which depends on such visual links to function effectively. As a pragmatic compromise, the Paulians dangled the anthropomorphic carrots of angelic and saintly icons before their Pagan converts For this dubious reason, the so-called Christian Kabbalah was more Magical than its non-visual Hebrew antecedent - explaining its evolution into the 'Neo-Solomonic' system we prac- tice today. Romantically, we may speculate that this ancient religion of Solomon's may well have evolved in a manner that the sage old monarch intended. If he was the first Magus, he may have envisioned a secret tradition, sought only by the wise, which would perpetuate the truth he had discovered: that the spirit of Divine Providence within us has many faces: good and evil, male and female - all reflected in the multifaceted Jewel of the Microcosm, while in the Macrocosm they are ALL ONE.

Hebrew kabbalists were always aware that there was a \"missing letter\" in their alphabet (see Gershom Scholem's ON THE KABBALAH & ITS SYMBOLISM). This formula and its more conventional 22 letter alternative, ShMAT (n~DW = 741) (see Sepher Sephiroth in The Equinox. Crowley lists the formula but not in the most elegant arrangement ) are discussed elsewhere in this volume. 2. The Bible history of this period was written by the Levities to favor Yahweh as The One and Only True God. Actually he was their one-and-only tribal god, whom they, like all bedouin tribes of that era, had carried with them in a sacred box. Idris Shah recounts that there were 360 of these \"tribal gods\" set up in a great circle inside The Kabba at Mecca in the days before Mohammed chucked them all out and dedicated the Temple to Allah (EL = Aleph Lamed, a prototype of Allah). We should also note that the ancient Semitic nobility dedicated themselves to higher divinities than the common people, thus Hiram of Tyre and Solomon could both have been devotees of EL - leading to cooperation in building a great central Temple that would have spiritually united their peoples. In line with this we should also recall that the ten northern (\"Lost\") tribes of Israel preferred \"EL\" over YHVH as their Most High God even after the conquest of Canaan.

The historical reality behind this romantic image is an example of suppressed truth reasserting itself in legend and folklore. The fact is that much of European magick and witchcraft was developed from Arabian sources emanating from Moorish Spain before 1492 c.e. For a millennium clouds of smoke have been stirred up to obscure this essential truth by rabbis who did not want the origins of medieval kab- balah too closely examined, by imams and even Sufis who did not want the medieval Pagan cults of Harran and Morocco revived. A mixed bag of Christians, Theosophists and self-styled authorities on Nazi occultism continue to insist that Western magick is essentially a survival of Manichaean Gnosticism. A fresh wind of genuine scholarship, emanating from the University of London, has recently blown away this long-standing smoke screen. Frances Yates' (1964) inquiry into the origins of Renaissance Neoplatonism has pointed to the Hispano-Moorish Picatrix as a major source for the astrological Magick of the 15th cen- tury Magus, Marsilio Ficino. This revelation, along with J.B. Segal's (1963) study on the Sabian Planetary Cult of Harran, directed our attention back to Lynn Thorndike's (1923) monumental, History of Magic and Experimental Science wherein we discovered a wealth of information on Arabian Magical lore. In the Terminal Essay following his translation of Alf Layah Wa Laylah, Burton describes 9th century Baghdad as the richest and noblest city in the world. Cinematic Sinbad fantasies hardly exagger- ate its luxury and power. These were the times of the Great Caliphs and their fabulous Court Magicians. Mightiest of the Wizards of Old Baghdad was Thebit ibn Korat, the Sabian from Harran. The Sabians were a mysterious race of celestial magicians who had lived in their ancestral city of Harran since before the time of Abraham. There they had perpetuated the astro-magical rituals of ancient Sumer and Akkad. To this arcanum they had added the Book of Enoch and the writings of Hermes Trismegistus. In the Koran, the Prophet had cited them as exempt from forced conversion to Islam and 88"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"so they were allowed to profess their Pagan philosophy while serving the Sultans as court astrologers and wizards. This is why the magick described in the Arabian Nights has such an obviously Pagan charac- ter. The practice of attributing specific metals, perfumes, col- ors, jewels and geometric forms to the planets in magical rituals can be traced back to the Sabians. Although there was some interest among medieval Jews in astrology, the astrologi- cal planetary aspects of magick (and of the Practical Kabbalah) are Sabian. Besides the great Sabian influence we should also consid- er the writings of the 9th century Islamic sage, Alkindi who authored a treatise called, The Theory of Magick Art or Stellar Rays which was the precursor of Ficino's \"Spiritus\" concept. The idea of man acting in syn- chronicity with the celestial pulse of a living universe goes back to Alkindi. The works of Albumasar, Costa ben Luca and Rasis should also be cited as major sources from which European magicians drew their inspirations. In the area of sexual magick we should consider the Beni Udhra cult of sexual arousal without consummation: intended to raise enthu- siasm which would be redirected into poetic inspiration. This practice spread from Baghdad to Spain and influenced the medieval European \"Courts of Love\" according to Walker (1970) . In the Kabbalistic perspective there is the question of language itself.

This is an intrinsic, unilateral system whereas Hebrew 1. depends on a bilateral relation- ship with mathematics (his math analog is profoundly important in its own right but the mathematical relationship also obtains in Arabic as well; e.g., the \"Barbarous Names\" of the grimoires are of Arabic or Gnostic origin and are actually number formulas in letter form) . Semitic Paganism manifesting in Moorish Spain also seems to have been a major source of what became European Witchcraft: a theory that Gerald Gardner himself lent support to in his novel, High Magic's Aid (1949) . Idries Shah (1964) suggests that Witchcraft grew out of the cult and totem of the Aniza tribe, the word for goat (Anz ) being cognate with Aniza. He also cites the use of an \"AI- dhame\" knife, meaning \"blood-letter\". The Witches' cross-quarterly festivals are noted as being identical with those in the Arabian calendar. The use of a datura- based flying ointment - also cited by Michael Harner (1973) as cen- tral to European Witch-cult practice - is corroborated by Shah's lin- guistic reconstructions. Arkon Daraul (1962) likewise attributes a Moorish-Spanish origin to European Witchcraft but he links it to a Moroccan Cult of the Double-Homed\" ( Which might be an outgrowth of the Aniza cult cited by Shah ) . Daraul also mentions an \"Al-dhame\" knife for self-sacrifice.

After months of spec- ulative meditation on how to form the True Body of Light, I suddenly realized that the building of the Microcosmic Tree within the body was 93"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"Figure 6.-- The Planets Within.

The inspiration came literal- ly 'in a flash', the symbolic \"Lightning Flash\" that descends through the sephiroth of The Tree in numerical sequence from Kether down to Malkuth. (See Figure 8. ) With a mystical certainty I knew that the Sephira of Tiphareth was identical with the Chakra of Anahata in the Raja Yoga system. This was the key to bringing the Eastern and Western microcosmic mandalas together. Even though I was the catalyst, I must credit Sor. Psyche (Lady Mara) with opening my chakras via the 5S technique during Sor. Artemis' and my initiation into The Order of 1734 on the 4th of October, 1975. Fra. Dejuiti (Joe Wilson) deserves subsequent credit for rectifying the Names of Power of the classic Goetia conjuration in line with the Caduceus sequence (see the Planetary Septegram Ritual) - and we should not forget the historical precedent: the 17th century Hermetic philosopher, Johann Gitchel, who produced a mysterious drawing (see Figure 6.) showing the planets roughly in line with the chakra positions in kabbalistic order (Hall, 1916: 1xxv). Here again, as with our Goetia method, we may be experiencing a recovery as well as a new develop- ment. But the ultimate proof of the validity of the Hermetic Caduceus has been its successful use in-Lodge for twenty years. It may be a more profound contribution to the Western Occult Revival than our notable reconstruction of Goetia evocation. It was necessary to keep the secret only until the system proved itself - now it may be shared with other builders of The Temple Within. 94"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"It has been suggested that Yoga was originated in the West by Pythagoras and then imported into India by Alexander (Iskandar) sev- eral hundred years before Patanjali wrote down the precepts in Sanskrit. The ancient Hermetic Caduceus represents the snake-like pri- mary Nadis of the Ida and the Pingala, intertwined about the central channel of the Sushumna and crowned by the winged essence of lib- erated consciousness at Sahasraram. This striking similarity has been noted and pondered upon as long as Yoga has been known in the West (Woodroffe, 1919:21) . There have been numerous attempts to align the sepheroth of the Otz Chiim (Tree of Life) with the chakras of the Yoga system. These efforts have always failed because their authors refused to con- sider the problem from a logical perspective, prefering instead to base their interpretations on literal readings of the Hindu and kabbalistic texts. In the traditional relation of the Otz Chiim to the Adam Kadmon (spiritual body) the sepheroth are arranged on three pillars instead of one, as on the Sushumna of the chakras. In medieval and renaissance iconography this led to the placement of the sepheroth on the shoul- ders, hips, etc. Occultists, respecting \"tradition\" above all else, have tended to perpetuate this naive conception even though all but the most credulous among them are aware that the Otz Chiim is not a structur- al diagram but rather a philosophical schematic. Conibining the three Pillars of The Tree into one central \"Sushumna\" was too simple and drastic for them to consider - even with The Lightning Flash or Sword of Wisdom staring them right in the face. In fairness to those G. D. adepts (mainly Regardie) who con- ceived \"The Middle Pillar\" exercise, no raising of the Kundalini was ever intended. Theirs was not an attempt to develop a Tantric Yoga of the West but rather a meditation on the Tree of Life in relation to the human body. It seems the 13th century kabbalist, Abraham Abulafia actually went further in our direction, combining breathing exercises, the chanting of Holy Names, the musical scale and color visualizations in his meditation practice (Scholem, 1974: 180) In developing - or if one prefers, recovering - the Psychic Centers of the West, certain priorities had to be met: first, the physical 95"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"points employed in the Raja system had to be matched along the spinal cord as a logical concession to centuries of successful practice in the East. In this respect the physiological control relationships as stated by Dr Mishra (1959:73-80) would be retained intact. Second, the Heart Chakra, Anahata, had to correspond to Tiphareth, the strongest link between the two systems. And finally, most important of all, the Western system had to be philosophically consistent with the Holy Kabbalah. This was a tall order but the solu- tion - as mentioned above - came 'In a flash'; in point of fact, the \"Lightning Flash\" diagram that the G.D. used to show the descent of the Spirit down through each Sephira. The natural numerical sequence of The Tree solved the problem. If Tiphareth (number 6) is anchored at Anahata in the chest, then Geburah (number 5) is at Vishudda in the throat, Chesed (num- ber 4) is then at Anja, behind the Third Eye, and this places Da' ath, the boundary of the Yetziran Astral dimension and gateway to the Abyss, in the center of the skull vault with Binah , the Supernal Mother con- noting \"Understanding\", (number 3) in the right cerebral hemisphere and Chockmah, the Supernal Father connoting \"Wisdom\", (number 2) in the left half of the cerebellum where kabbalists had located them hundreds years before modem medical science confirmed their vision. The ineffable originating source of Light and Power is Kether (number 1). Kether sends its Light down through the Tibetan-Tantric \"Aperture of Brahman\" (Evans-Wentz, 1935-267) depression in the top of the skull where the soul leaves the body. (One can easily locate this spot with the fingers.) Above this natural gateway lies Kether in the highest essentially Macrocosmic dimension of Atziluth, which may be compared to the thousand petalled lotus of Sahasraram in the Hindu system. In descending order, Netsach (number 7) is at Manipura in the solar-plexus, Hod (number 8) is at Svadlstana below the navel, and Yesod (number 9) in the genitalia. Here we have another gateway between the Olams (dimensions), with the physical world of Asshia with its one Sephira, Malkuth, being linked to Yesod in the Yetzirah by the contact proximity of the asana position.

This is a Western System. These are Psychic Centers, not Chakras. They are to be envi- sioned as Jewels within the Mystic Rose rather than the Lotus and they are opened by our traditional God Names in Atziluth on the seven- note scale rather than by Sanskrit mantras. We frankly admit to a con- siderable degree of syncretism with Raja and Tantric Yoga; in fact we use their techniques whenever possible - but the determining sym- bolism and philosophy of the system is Western. The Ida, the Pingala and the Sushumna are ours via the snakes and staff of Hermes' Caduceus, but what of the twenty-two paths con- necting the sepheroth ? Should they be considered the secondary Nadis? The answer to that must be no. It should be realized that the Paths of the Tree are subjective and arbitrary as to their placement in any pre-existing etheric sense. In the construction of the Body of Light Within they should be considered tasks to be accomplished, or astral initiations, via our preliminary pathworking system rather than incre- ments of a completed system to be established inside the body. Two other questions must be answered before we accept this system for practice. First, are the kabbalistic attributes of the sephiroth compatible with the characteristics of the Hindu chakras and does it matter if they are not? And, second, is the kabbalistic color scheme applicable to them? To answer the former we must say that the kab- balistic centers are remarkably similar but not identical. If this is a problem then consider that there are different chakra systems for every Tibetan deity and the Dervish orders, according to Idries Shah, con- sider the . actual physical location of the Lataif (Sufic psychic centers) to be \"theoretical\" (Shah, 1964:332). Secondly, Hindu symbolic colors applied to the chakras do not always match the colors skryed on the etheric plane by adepts. Of course our kabbalistc colors do not match either but this is to be expected. We are practicing magick, not passively observing psychic phenomenon. Symbolic color is what we apply to the center to activate our effect, not the actual color the center itself. If this is understood there should be no problem in working the system and reaping the tremendous benefits it affords.

She laughs and then speaks in voice not her own: \"I am here, my children. Why have you called me?\" The operation I have just described is an advanced technique which we call Assumption of Goddess-form. It is actually more of a sensual magick operation than one of sex magick- but our Hieros Gamos (Divine Congrex) uses this same tactile, Mesmeristic 1. technique as a starting point so we will begin at the beginning. First you should be aware that straight Assumption of Goddess (or God) form operations do not, or should not, involve direct sexual stimulation. The technique is more Mesmeristic than hypnotic and depends on directing energy flows up and down the body. If one of the massagers lets his or her fingers stray onto (or into) the receiver's erogenous zones, you will short-circuit the current. I vividly recall 101"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"having a grim, hand-clenching battle with a former student during an assumption operation to keep him from taking liberties with one of our lodge sisters who was deep in trance. Make certain that you all agree on the rules of conduct before you undertake this type of operation. It is absolutely essential for your receiver to have successfully evoked the entity in a previous Goetia Contact Operation. The opera- tor and the receiver should establish a comfortable rapport with the entity and request its safe cooperation before performing an assump- tion operation. Needless to say, certain entities should be absolutely avoided in this regard. I can only recommend Astarte and Ba' al for this sort of work and even with these friendly beings I urge caution. (No one under eigh- teen years of age should be allowed to engage in any Goetia type oper- ations, especially assumptions.) You can use your Earth Pantacle mirror as an overhead specu- lum if you put three or four rings around the rim to hang it from. If you have a full sized temple, I would suggest a larger mirror. (y.Ie use a convex 21\" diameter dark mirror mounted on a circular wooden frame which also works well for path workings and astral time travel.) Place the spirit's sigil on the mirror as you would in a regular Goetia opera- tion. Be sure to have the receiver wear the spirit's lamen. Place three candles at the corners of the Triangle, acquire a bottle of scented mas- sage oil (warm it to blood temperature) and you are ready to operate. In other respects, straight assumption operations are similar to Goetia contacts. You must alter the conjuration to say: \"Within this Circle and upon this Triangle ... Speak to us through our receiver; bless her and harm her not!\" The receiver should not allow herself or himself to become fully possessed. When receiving in this type of working take an observer's seat somewhere in your mind and monitor the entity you are channel- ing. For the receiver an assumption should be the spiritual equivalent of a \"method\" actor's performance. Invite the entity in and allow your- self to \"play the role\" but always remember that this is Magick, not Voodoo. You are not a horse for the gods to ride, you are a host enter- taining an honored guest. Don't let it go further than that. A compe- tent magister will make sure that such operations are carefully planned 102"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"and properly performed with consenting, emotionally stable adults who know exactly what they are doing. As we stated above, straight assumption operations are sensual but not sexual - and yet they are the starting point for the Hieros Gamos or what our Wiccan friends refer to as \"The Great Rite\". The Hieros Gamos is a Sacred Marriage, not an orgy. It is a very private and Holy Rite. It involves, or should involve, one man and one woman who have already established a deeply meaningful sexual rela- tionship. Here again, do not use these methods for seduction because they are too complex, intense and subjective for people who don't already know and respect each other in the most intimate sense. Before we get into operational details a brief review of western sex magick theory might be in order: - You remember Plato's idea of the original idea? Plotinus took it out of the abstract and hooked up an energy flow (the Star Wars \"Force\") to \"the idea\", giving us what is known in occult terminology as \"an astral pre-form\". In other words .all physical forms and events must be preceded by a pre-form in the Yetzirah (astral) dimension. The entire active aspect of Magick involves creating and pro- graming these astral pre-forms. There are several methods for doing this: creative visualization, ritual, talisman creation, etc. - but one of the most dynamic and effective techniques is to sexually create a mag- ical child and program it to accomplish your desire. This method works on the old kabbalistic doctrine that every sex act, even mastur- bation, creates some sort of pre-form entity on the astral. Congrex between a man and a woman will therefore result in a magical off- spring if no physical conception is accomplished. (This very ancient belief is one of the reasons behind the religious prohibition against having sex for fun. God creates and so do you - and the clergy doesn't want you to know it!) Therefore, if you and your partner decide you want to create a magical child, you fITst make a talisman to repre- sent it and the purpose it's going to accomplish, then you have sex and impregnate the talisman with your combined effluvium. Nine days later you go through the same procedure again and re-impregnate the talisman. You then seal it up, forget it and let it perform its task. 103"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"I can relate from personal experience that this is one of the most pow- erful techniques in magick. It virtually has to work, even if you don't believe in it! As described it is a simple, mechanical technique that will suc- ceed to some degree no matter how basically you perform it - back before W.W. I, male German O. T. O. members often carried out the rite without their wives even being aware of it -- however, if you want to get the most out of the method, you will want to ritualize it the way the ancients did. In other words, you will enact the Hieros Gamos, or Sacred Marriage. This Great Rite was usually performed by a high priest and high priestess or a king and queen at the beginning of the year to ensure prosperity for the land and the people. We symbolize it in our Nuptiae pageant at Vernal Equinox. The lines of poetry heading this chapter are from that rite and may be used as the only spoken words the manifest- ed God and Goddess need recite to each other when coming together for their congrex. The sacramental mead is poured from Ba'al's Golden Flagon into Astarte's Silver Goblet and then shared as a sym- bolic gesture of the physical consummation about to take place. However, you may wish to add the following statement of purpose: - Astarte: Ba'al: What task shall the Child of our Union perform, oh my Lord? Verily He shall ( here state the task) In Good Time and Full Measure! In ancient Babylon the Hieros Gamos was enacted on top of a ziggurat whereas in Canaan it was performed on a hilltop or in the inner \"Holy of Holies\" chamber of the Temple. Here again the proce- dure is straight forward and simple. The priestess invokes the God into the priest and then the God invokes His Goddess consort into the priestess. In modem practice you may carry out the invocations under the suspended mirror, in the same manner as in an Assumption opera- tion, or you may enact the procedure standing up while facing a full 104"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"Figure 1.

When both have assumed their godforms, the Great Rite is for- mally consummated and the mighty talisman of the working is charged (see Figure 1. below). Aside from its tremendous magical potency this is a profoundly beautiful experience that can deeply enrich and re-empower a monog- amous relationship. If you and your part- ner are beginning to find your sexual relations getting just a little boring, invite Ba' al and Astarte into your lives and let them rekindle the fires of romantic love. In closing let me again caution you against any friv- olous, irresponsible use of these power- ful techniques or any degenerate perver- sion of their worthwhile purposes.

Mesmerism, the first popular form of trance induction to be introd- uced to the western world, was developed by Dr Franz Anton Mesmer in the late 18th century. The technique depended more on an influx or exchange of magnetic energy, directed by the Mesmerist, than on the hypnotic induction routines we are familiar with today. A Mesmerist would not say: \"You are very relaxed, you are feeling sleepy, etc.\", he'd simply put a hand on your shoulder, look into your eyes and com- mand you to \"Sleep!\" ... and you would. In spite of many attempts to discredit the old system, it still works. Mesmerism is not hypnosis but the two methods overlap. Whenever hypnosis is combined with physical contact or eye contact, Mesmerism comes into play. The famous American hypnotist, Milton Erickson, was said to have \"a hypnotic touch\". Even his friends were reluctant to shake hands with him. This was pure Mesmerism ...

You should employ it every day for inspiration, protection and personal centering. You can perform it without a sword or gestures as an internal projection of your imagination at any time you need protection. In its full dress, formal application it is the required \"circle casting\" or \"quarters rite\" preceding every ritual in nearly all Western magical tra- ditions and variations of it are even used by Wiccans. The Golden Dawn used it primarily in the banishing form to cleanse a temple before work- ing. We use it in the invoking form to consecrate our magick circle and set \"The Wards of Power\" at the compass quarters. These Wards are tra- ditionally the four Archangels of the Tetragrammaton. We employ the banishing form at the end of the rite to close and seal the circle of our working. Background: - The Pentagram Ritual is a legacy from The Order of the Golden Dawn. The invoking and banishing Pentagram forms were found in the original Cypher Manuscript but the concept of the ritual itself must be credited to W. Wynn Westcott. Before this elegant rite was conceived each magician had his or her own way of casting a circle, often involving the actual tracing of the circle on the floor or ground. Figure 1. sv- Banishing Structure: - The Pentagram Ritual is still reffered to as \"The Lesser Pentagram Ritual\" in The Golden Dawn papers because it utilized only the final form attributed to the Earth Element. The term \"Lesser 108"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"Pentagram Ritual\" is used because the so-called \"Greater Pentagram Ritual\" used to open Enochian Tablets was later incorporated into the Enochian \"Watchtower Opening.\" In our video we use only the Earth Element Pentagram form as a minimum opening and closing requirement -- but the experienced operator can certainly use the other elemental forms as an additional Quadrant opening similar to the Enochian Watchtower concept. (If this confuses you at this point, don't worry about it. Our mandatory Planetary Septagram Rite will cover the Quadrants as well.) In activating these Pentagram forms on the astral you invoke toward the point of the Element and banish from that point. Earth is on the lower left point, hence we are invoking Spirit into and banishing it from the Element of Earth. This is an appropriate opening and closing for all magical operations because it brings Spirit into and then releas- es it from the physical plane or material basis of the work ( for a more detailed discussion of this concept see The Lesser Ritual of the Pentagram by Fra. Perseus and Sor. Kalla in T-7R no. 7 ). Because these are Earth Pentagrams they must be visualized in bright, neon green! 1. The words and Names of Power must be vibrat- ed and projected.

Translated it means: \"Thine is the Kingdom, The Power and the Glory Forever, Amen!\" ) Trace the first Earth Pentagram in the East with the point of your sword (invoking to begin the rite; banishing to close).

Complete the circle in the North with the final Pentagram saying: \"AGLA!\" (Ah-gay-Iah - or, if you prefer, Ateh Gibor Le-Olam Adonai! Thine is the Power forever my Lord!)

Michael grant me creative force and energy ... Gabriel grant me unlimited love and sensitivity ... Auriel grant me boundless wealth and prosperity\" .... Then we add the visualization of the Tetragrammaton overhead in colored Phoenician letters starting from right to left, Ah Mah Sha Oh, (or Sha Ma Ah Ta) while saying: \"Great Lord of the Universe, grant me freedom and spiritual enlightenment.\" The second variation is the protection version. It is usually done in the invoking mode but can be done as a banishing in conjunction with other rites. It is the same as the basic form except that the Archangels are visualized as facing outward in a shielding mode. The following petitions are made: \"Raphael, protect me (us)from the per- ils of wind and plague . . Michael, protect me (us)from the dangers of fire and fury . .. Gabriel, protect me (us) from the threat of flood and storm. . .

Black magick uses your own weak- ness against you. There is another variation to be mentioned. This is really not a regular Pentagram ritual but it is a four-quarters rite. It is more of a New Age NeoPagan form suited for an outdoor setting. It is especial- ly good to use with non-initiates present.

The G.D. color scales are NOT what we see on the astral, they are what we project and impose in order to accomplish our purpose.

Although the Planetary Septagram design is traditional, our method of drawing down, inter- nalizing and localizing the Spirit in the Sphere of the working is orig- inal with the O.T.A. - Remember, in Goetia all operations take place in the Sphere of Yesod. Therefore when this rite is performed to open a Goetia operation, only the Yesod form is used. The Planetary Sphere within Yesod will then be evoked by the Magus during the conjuration. Banish ----..

The opening and closing Septagram rites should be arranged accordingly (see previous chapter).

He then removes the silken cloth covering the crystal and rings the bell over it to symbolize the descent of the Holy Spirit. Following this he places the incense burner into its chamber and all take seats on the low stools around the altar. The Magus recites the Invocation and then the recitation passes around deosil as the others begin a soft overtone chant of the Archangel's name. After everyone has invoked in tum, the chant con- tinues to grow in power and intensity until the Glory comes upon the altar and the Magus makes the sign of adoration and welcomes the Archangel. He may then make a petition or channel an oracle; follow- ing this he will ask the person on his left: \"Does the Angel speak through you?\" If the answer is \"Not at this time,\" the Magus will ask the question of the next person on his left and so on until all have had a chance to vocalize the \"knowings\" which have entered their enchant- ed minds ... Finally the Magus will stand (cueing all to rise) and thank the Archangel for coming, bidding Him or Her \"To remain ever stronger in our hearts and to return to us when reverently called by the rites of Holy Magick. Hail and Farewell!\" He then covers the ball with silk. The Planetary and Elemental banishing rites are then performed to conclude the operation.

Whether it is wise to intimidate elements of the subconsciousness mind is a deb at- able point in any method of evocation, but I think it should be espe- cially avoided when keying off your own, or your receiver's, reflec- tion. You may need to repeat the first conjuration two or even three times in a stronger tone of voice to bring the spirit in - but any more than this should not be necessary. 2. CIRCUMAMBULATION With a full complement (Operator, Receiver, Server and Acolyte) this can be a very impressive phase of the ritual. It is always marched deosil (clockwise) with the East as a starting point. The Operator beats the drum and leads the sonorous overtone vowel chant (Ah _. Aae - Eee - Oh - 000) ,the receiver wears the lamen of the spirit and has no task except to spiral into the vortex by concen- trating on, and pivoting around, the pentacle of the sphere (within Yesod) placed in the center of the circle. The server gently swings the lighted censer, burning the appropriate incense. The Acolyte rings the bell each time he passes the East, marking the circumambulations. As the circumambulation proceeds, the pace, the chant and the drumbeat gradually increase in speed, volume and intensity. After the last ring and final drumbeat, the Magus and receiver enter the circle while the others quickly and carefully move the equipment into position. This stage business is covered by the ...

It should be read by one of the operator's assistants, or recited from memory by the Magus, to cover the setting-up phase directly after the circumambulation has been completed.

(See ANGELS OF THE SHEMHAMEPHORASH.) The Magus should open the Brass Vessel, take out the sigil of the spirit, show it to the receiver and then turn it to show the reverse side, with the sigil of the Angel, while he recites the Latin versicle - e.g., Domini dilexi decorum domus tuae et locem habita- tiones gloriae tuae: Man - ah - del!

During the circumambulation the receiver should be wearing the Spirit's Lamen. The metal (or finish) of the lamen is determined by the spirit's rank (e.g. Dukes, ~ = copper) and has Solomon's banishing pentagram on the reverse side. The spirit's sigil apprears three times: on the lamen, on parchment in the Brass Vessel, and on the skrying mirror traced with a black china marker (note: we used a yellow marker in the video only for better camera visibility). Usually the receiver stands before the mirror. Fra. Ake Phalos (Jim Nobles) prefers to seat his receivers so that they can be more relaxed. (In this case a stool is recommended because a chair might interfere with psychic center energies and also has a seance connotation.) 3. This is our Pagan Tetragrammaton, which we have explained earlier. Operators who are Jewish or Old Testament oriented Christians should substitute Yod He Vau He for Ah Mah Sha Oh. 4. You should bring the LightJPower all the way down and ground it in the Malkuth center. This is the Atziluthic descending empowerment. Then bring it up, via the Briah dimension, to the Sphere of the working (remembering that this is all within Yesod) e.g., Ashtaroth = Venus = Netsach = \"Hanie!\". 5.

But what happens when the Dark Side comes through unexpectedly and with over- whelming power? What do you do then? I T WAS THE LAST NIGHT OF THE FULL MOON in September at the secluded, tree-shrouded Montsalvat Hermitage- Temple in Pasadena. Frater Prometheus, an actor and aspiring screen writer, suggested we perform another Bardonian evocation. It would be our third this month. Prometheus had just discovered Franz Bardon's sec- ond volume and was fascinated by its multitude of empowering spir- its. I sympathized. I had had a similar romance with the same book 127"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"many years ago when I was beginning my study and practice of mag- ick. Even then I had thought Bardon somewhat mad. However, Bardon's was a Holy Madness, not unlike my own in those days, to which I felt a strong kinship ... Yes, we would do another operation from Bardon. Magical enthusiasm should be ridden hard while it lasts - like heavy surf following a storm. And, if we needed a rationale, it was in line with our Second Degree training. I had been supervising Prometheus and his lady, Soror Rhiannon, in the summoning of Goetia spirits during the waxing moon periods for the last several months. I always start off new Second Degree people with Astarte (Ashteroth) and Ba' al (Bael) from the tra- ditional Goetia of the Lemegeton to introduce them to the patron Goddess and God of our Temple - and then to such benign lesser enti- ties as Vassago to train them in the hypnotic conjuration-to-visible- appearance technique that has been the Ordo Templi Astartes' main- stay for the past twenty-six years. Franz Bardon's Magical Evocation is closely related to this system 1. but does require a zodiacal circle. Our nine-foot Solomonic hard circle is elemental on one side and celestial on the reverse, so any one of Bardon's carefully calibrated entourage of spirits can be easily located and the pentagram pointed precisely in his/her direction. Our standing triangle, dark speculum, planetary lamens, evocation can- dles and other standard Goetia equipment can then serve without mod- ification. As it turned out Soror Rhiannon wanted to operate and I was asked to receive. As Magister I don't often get the chance to be the receiver in evocation operations. Full moon time is at a premium and the new people need the experience. However, this was not a regular meeting and Prometheus had just received the Bardonian spirit, Pigios (15 0 n ) the night before. Both initiates had been staying with me at the Hermitage during that time. I should have been looking forward to the operation but I was not. From a mundane perspective it had been a hectic week. I was tired and would rather have gone to bed with a novel or even watched t.v. 128"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"I took a nap after dinner when I should have been researching for the operation. At eight p.m. I awoke, heaved up off the couch, fumbled for Bardon's second volume and grunted: \"Okay, I'll find something Mercurial that's good for writers. Maybe it'll help us both corne up with something saleable.\" I had just mixed up a batch a very pungent storax incense the night before so Mercury (Hod) seemed a good idea. I found the Mercurial spirits in Bardon - all seventy-two of them but the signifi- cance of that venerable number did not register with me at the time. I selected Nithael (number 54 at 26-30 0 I). He was described as \" ... a great friend of all artists, writers and orators, & etc.\" - Everything positive, up-beat, constructive; one of 'the good guys'. I even instructed Soror Rhiannon to drop the Goetia \"Barbarous Names\" from the conjuration so we wouldn't contaminate the transcendental- ism of Bardon with anything demonic. What could go wrong? I liked the sigil too; it wasn't Bardon's typical automatic writ- ing in his Liber Spiritum. This one had captions in a strange language and a wavy symmetry in its design. I copied it onto the dark mirror with a black grease pencil and then duplicated it on a blank brass lamen I would wear around my neck. I was ready ... We sat down around a small, low table on which a single can- dle burned. We would preform a preliminary meditation in the dark- ened common room before processing through the veil into the Temple.c Before beginning pranayama I assigned tasks: Rhiannon would ring the quarters in circumambulation, Prometheus would han- dle the censer and serve incense. He would also read The Bomless Invocation while we were setting up to operate. With assignments made we settled down in asanas, did our breathing exercises and then closed our eyes. I brought down power through the Chakras with the aid of an electronic synthesizer to play the descending scale. We opened our eyes to the candle flame. Prometheus directed us in breath- ing in the rays and charging the psychic center of Hod. We took hands, 129"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"synchronized power and carried it with us, intoning an overtone chant, into the Temple. After the traditional lighting of the lodge, invocation to The Goddess and the Invoking Pentagram Ritual we proceeded to the oper- ation itself. After declaring that we would succeed in summoning the spirit \"Because we will it!\", the circumambulation commenced. With our eyes locked on the pentacle of Mercury placed in the pentagram, we slowly paced the circle eight times deosil. With the muffled drumbeat, the smoking censer swinging, the vibrant chant- ing and the bell ringing the quarters this traditional circumambulation was a journey into dreamtime. It has always been one of the most dra- matic elements of the Magical Art. As the receiver, I emptied my mind so that I could spiral backward through the distant Ages and out- ward through the dark reaches of the Universe as we revolved around the twelve spoked wheel of space and time. With the last ring of the bell we positioned the Triangle and entered the Circle. Prometheus intoned The Bornless Invocation while I took my position facing the mirror with a candlestick in each hand. His trained actor's voice was thick and rich with power: \"Thee I invoke, The Bornless One! Thee that didst create the earth and the heavens. Thee that didst create the night and the day - the darkness and the light! Thou hast distinguished between the just and the unjust!\" I wondered if there was any of our alchemical fluid condenser still active behind the mirror but quickly put this thought out of my mind. The only thing I needed to do now was to get the lighting right on my hooded face and then commence the passive, unblinking stare at my reflection that brings on the blackout ... \"I summon thee, Spirit Nithael, strengthened by Almighty God! And I command thee by the Holy and glorious Names . . . \" From behind me Rhiannon intoned the descending God Names in Atziluth, ending with Elohim Tzabaotn commanding the Sephiroth of Hod . . . \"I command thee by Him who spake it and it was done!

And I am a spirit of the dark side.\" Rhiannon welcomed the spirit, somewhat hesitantly, and asked for an oracle ... \"I am not an evil spirit,\" the entity purred, \"- But I am a spir- it of evil! \" At this point the part of me that was still 'Me' was entrenching itself into a defensive position where reason and sanity could prevail. We had a very strong contact going here; one of the strongest I had ever experienced! For me it was more independently visual than any evocation I could remember from twenty-seven years of practice. I usually receive \"on-face\" - that is after black-out my own reflection reappears as someone else along with that undeniable sense of alien presence that confirms the contact - but this was different. What I was seeing and experiencing was not some dimly remembered archetype from Jung's Collective Unconscious but rather a transpersonal, un-human presence that seemed to come from the far reaches of outer space. One might say it was almost 'Lovecraftian'. 131"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"As I continued to stare deep into the dark mirror the panther metamorphosed into a deformed, fungoid face that glowed in fluo- rescent mauve. \"I can teach you things that would shock even your jaded minds,\" his voice intoned seductively through my lips, \"- But I warn you that you should balance my teachings with the bright side of Mercury. \" The power and intensity of the contact was actually increasing. My emotional psyche was fascinated, intrigued, seduced - but the rational part of my mind was becoming increasingly critical. This wasn't what Franz Bardon had described. This was not what we had set out to summon. This is not the way the system was supposed to work. ... But wasn't Magick supposed to be an adventure into the unknown? \"Look - I will open a dark portal for you and take you on a far journey. . .\" the spirit whispered and his monster face melted into a swirling vortex, pulling at my astral form to suck me into a black hole far out in the universe ... I knew I could go through it! I wanted to go through it! \"Banish this thing!\" I muttered to Rhiannon who stood close behind me. She sounded relieved as she recited the banishing: \"Because you have diligently answered our demands, I do license thee to depart, giving harm to no living creature. . . and may the peace of God con- tinue between me and thee! Depart and begone. . . but be ever-ready to return when summoned by the sacred rites of Magick!\" The mirror clouded and cleared. The presence was gone. I sup- pressed a shudder as Rhiannon turned the lamen on my chest, and snuffed out the candles. I did a banishing pentagram ritual and we closed the Temple. Back inside the Hermitage the usual after-operation critique ses- sion and log entry was conducted. We always do this directly after the operation because magical visions \"are very much like dreams. If you 132"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"don't write them down immediately you'll forget important details. As receiver I was first to transcribe my impressions in the log book. Frater Prometheus had been seated in the server's position, feed- ing incense into the thurible during the summoning. He had wanted to ask questions but it was all over too soon. Soror Rhiannon, who was not an experienced operator, was surprised that the manifestation came so quickly and was so powerful. Also, \" ... It could not give us the blessings needed,\" she wrote. Neither faulted me for bailing out when I did. We all knew something had gone wrong. In his book Bardon clearly stated that he had excluded demons from his list and, to make matters even stranger, \"Nithael\" was actually one of the seventy-two angels of the Shemhamephorash; the extended Name of God! These celestial angels are supposed to be the direct and benign counterparts of the Goetia's seventy-two demons. I went to my library and came back to the conference table with an arm load of books. Davidson's Dictionary of Angels gave Nithael Shemhamephorash status citing Barrett's Magus but also listed an obscure French reference that claimed he was \"Afallen angel\" who resides in Hell, \" ... And governs emperors, kings and civil and eccle- siastical personages of the highest rank.\" Knowing Barrett to be a lift from Agrippa I checked the with venerable Henry Cornelius himself and he concurred on the Heavenly status of Nithael. Bardon had put him in slot 54 at 26 0-30 0 ./ - right where Agrippa had him if you start from 0 0 Y (However, Golden Dawners should remember that Mathers started his Shemhamephorash off at 0 0 Q ). At this point Frater Prometheus remembered that he had opened the operation with a banishing rather than an invoking pentagram rit- ual. In our method of working we use an invoking pentagram ritual to call down the Guardian Angels of the Quarters and a banishing to clear out the Temple after completion. We had had no Quarter Guards ... I was beginning to understand what had happened. I went to the Goetia and checked number 54. In Crowley's ver- sion (B.M. MS. Sloane 2731) the position was occupied by Murmur, a 133"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"Duke (Venusian spirit) who appears as \"A warrior on a gryphon\", teaches philosophy and assists in necromancy. I dimly remembered summoning Murmur years ago. He didn't seem to have been the enti- ty we had contacted. Then, on impulse, I picked up Dr. Rudd's Treatise on Angel Magic (circa 1699). We use his short invocations to the Shemhamephorash Angels as a preliminary counter-balancing safety factor in Goetia operations. Nithael was there in position 54 - but Rudd had also included his own list of Goetia and other spirits. As I recalled, they were not in the same order as in Sloane Ms. 2731 which had been Mathers and Crowley's source. I turned to Rudd's list, counted out to 54 and felt the hairs rise on the back of my neck rise as I read: \"Ose is a great President ( Mercurial spirit) and comethforth like a leopard and counterfeiting to be a man. I checked this with the oldest list of Goetia spirits we have, Reginald Scot's 1584 Discovery of Witchcraft, and found Ose in slot 55 with an almost identical description ... except that Scot had added a warning: \" ... (H}e (Ose) transformeth a man's shape, and bringeth a man to that madness, that he thinketh himself to be that which he is not . . . \" I then recalled that Mercury is the only planet in the solar sys- tem that does not revolve. Its dark side is always dark. Perhaps this is why the Faustian shadow of Prometheus remains so demonic even as humankind progresses? With the next full moon we might have answers to that and other questions -- but we would be better prepared and take proper precau- tions. 3. :N9tes on 'Ihe 'Evocation of :A{jtfzael: 1.

When we consider that our Goetia Spirits are all circled around the lowest level of the Lunar Sphere (Fallen Angels controlled by the Moon), we see that Bardon's arrangement actually places the Shemhamephorash in an immediately superior position not unlike The Master Mandala. 2. fA preliminary meditation period in an outer chamber (we call it \"the common room\") before entering the Temple is a very sound practice. It gets everyone into a mild trance state so that the Temple remains a sacred precinct. In The Book of Solomon's Magick, I have not empha- sized this because it largely depends on the individual skill of the operator and a deep knowledge of our psychic center system. We sit in asanas around circular table upon which is placed one candle. We do pranayama on a four-four-four count, staring at the candle flame, until everyone is relaxed -- then the leader has the group close their eyes and visualize The Drawing Down of The Light as in the Septagram Ritual. (I use an electronic synthesizer on a descending harmonic scale.) The psychic center of the working is thus activated. We all join hands and energy is transmitted deosil around the circle. We slowly raise our joined hands until they are extended overhead, then we break the circle, seal the energy and process into the Temple humming an overtone chant in unison. 3. Next month we carried out a direct evocation of Ose with another receiver who agreed to undertake the operation without reading my previous log entry. This action was monitored and reported by a prominent academic authority on the occult, not a member of the O.T.A. Our receiver confirmed the \"Red eat's eyes\", said that Ose was \"A hunting God\" and represented \"Fiery aspects of the Tree\". \"Ose is the Spirit of Maya -- the images of this world. Reflections of the divine.\" When asked if he (Ose) had been summoned in the correct position, he replied: \"More or less, but I am fluid, like Mercury.\" Soror Astrea, a clairvoyant, saw a great swishing eat's tail behind our receiver. Our academic observer agreed that this was something beyond a Jungian Archetype. 135"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"T HESE BE THE 72 MIGHTY Kings and Princes which King Solomon Commanded into a Vessel of Brass, together with their Legions.

Golden Dawn magicians will point out that these sigils start at 0° Q (Leo) in their system but I would be very surprised if \"The Great Magician, Blaise Viginaire\" intended to use them in a sidereal pro- gression. (See Documentary Appendix. ) These sigils and verses are to be drawn and written on the back of the parchment sigil of your Goetia spirit. Before beginning the con- juration, the sigil should be taken from the Brass Vessel, both sides should be shown to the receiver and then the Latin verse is read by the Magus to invoke the power of the Angel.

Magic.a[ Tempie Furniture & 'Equipment H ERE IS WHERE WE COME to one of the most satisfying -- and for some people perhaps the most frustrating -- aspects of the art magical: building your temple equipment. Right at the outset let me explain that I have not provided fully scaled and dimen- sioned three view plans because some of you may not want to operate in a full size (18' x 18') temple setting. Our double cube altar is 42\" high and just manages to go through a standard door frame. The out- side diameter of our Circle is, according to Solomon, nine feet -- which means that, along with pillars in the north and south and room to cir- cumambulate, the 18' x 18' floor space is a minimum. Most spare bed- rooms aren't that big. You'll need a two car garage and then you'll have to panel and insulate it or freeze in the winter time. Hypnotic magick doesn't work very well when people's teeth are chattering, so you may have a lot of remodeling to do just to make the temple com- fortable-- and don't forget ventilation; you can't bum charcoal and incense in a completely sealed area. All considered, it might be better to scale down and settle for the spare bedroom when you are first get- ting started. Even so you may want to paint and carpet the area. Avoid black for two reasons: first it will not give you the deep, endless darkness that midnight blue will provide (black actually reflects light whereas blue totally absorbs it as any camera buff will tell you) -- and, second- 195"},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":"ly, if any profane invades your magical inner sanctum (and sooner or later this is certain to happen) black will convince him that you are a satanist. .. Real midnight blue paint has to be specially mixed at a paint store, but it should last a lifetime and is worth the trouble. Next get a dark blue indoor-outdoor carpet so that you have a completely blue chamber (see video). You may accent with burgundy drapes, vio- let veils, etc., but the basic color should always be dark blue. Now let's move to the frrst item you'll need to construct: the Magick Circle. The Circle can be made out of cloth or plywood. We've never used cloth so I can't give any experienced advice on that. I opted for plywood backed with fiberboard (but I must confess that I spent-a year designing and building props for Ringling Brother's Circus, so I tend to build things that can be stepped on by elephants !). E w If you decide to use a fiberboard backing to keep the plywood from warping, then be sure to use plenty of carpenter's wood glue and finishing brads. If you are wondering how to cut this monster out, this is the trick: drive a rod into the ground and tie a 4 1 / 2 ' cord to it. Put your pencil through a loop on the far end and score an arc on the ply- wood. Drop back 14\" and score an inside arc. Use a carpenter's square to bring your beam compass line out at right angles to mark off the radius at each end of your circle section. Cut this section out and use 196"},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":"it as a pattern for the next three sections. What could be simpler than that? For a lighter weight circle you might try laminating a top layer of masonite rather than fiberboard. It's also a better painting surface. After you've cut out the four sections, sand them, prime coat them and paint them black with a one inch white border along the out- side and inside edge. Now you are ready to decorate. Even if you are not intending to use u.v. sensitive fluorescent paint 1. you will still have to undercoat all your decorations with white. All lettering and symbols in the East are in bright yellow, in the South, flaming scarlet, in the West, bright blue and in the North, bright green. (See the PhoenicianlHebrew alphabet.) You may also add the signs of the zodi- ac and their ruling planets around each of the elemental symbols. Now to the Double-cube altar which will be placed in the center of the Circle for Angelic invocations and other transcendental opera- tions. The double cube should be exactly that; a double cube. The bot- tom half is painted black and the top half, white. Ours is made out of 1/4\" plywood on a 2\"x 2\" frame with a top lid frame made from l\"x 10\" lumber. Our altar is so heavy we need a handtruck to move it back and forth from the temple to our outdoor henge. If you don't have to do four offsite ceremonies a year I believe masonite for the four side pan- els and 1/4\" plywood for the top lid frame would be a better choice. Stay with the 2\" x 2\" frame, however, and make sure the top and incense chamber floor are both 1/4\" plywood. You'll notice in the video that we have four alchemical symbols in bas-relief around the sides of the upper cube. The Spirit Wheel sym- bol in the East swings out on a hinge as the door to the incense cham- ber. The other symbols are ~ sulphur in the South, ~ mercury in the West and Q salt in the North. You can jig them out of plywood with a scroll saw, then glue and tack them on. The altar top is also an area that can lend itself to further deco- ration. Look carefully at the video and see how we have painted the four quadrant colors (no fluorescents here) on the altar top and then applied a jigged-out, gold leafed compass rose with the Tetragram- maton letters at each directional point. Unless you apply several coats of clear liquid plastic varnish over the altar top it will quickly become 197"},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":"Top lid plate Smoke slots -- --.!~ ..... ~ Miter all corners Top lid frame 2\"x 2\" frame Incense serving port -----lll.l~ 198 Incense floor Vent holes"},{"pageNumber":207,"pageContent":"Cardboard backing (same dia.)

Solomon's Triangle has no standard dimensions but the white inner triangle must be equilateral. You may have noticed that our outer triangle (the black border surrounding the white inner surface) is two inches higher at the peak. This adds an aspect of dynamic distor- tion to an an otherwise static design. It gives the Triangle an element mystery it deserves as a portal between the worlds.

I know this sounds like a mundane option but some of these designs are frankly more evocative than what you might be able to create -- in any case you must have your glass professionally cut for you at a glass shop. This is not expensive. It will save you frustration and possibly serious injury. Also ask the glass shop to grind off the sharp edges for you so you won't cut yourself handling the plate. Buy three cans of spray lacquer; one silver (luna), one copper (venus) and one gloss black. Clean your glass with alcohol or carbon tetrachloride, then mist the inner surface with the metallic spray paints. I use an inward spiraling circular pattern evocative of a vortex far out in the depths of outer space. Make sure you keep this pattern subtle and delicate. After your metallic mist effect has completely dried, place the glass plate over a piece of black poster board to see how it will look when you seal it over with the black paint. If you like the effect of the metallic mist on the black background, then spray it with three layers of black, letting each layer dry fully before applying the next coat. However, if you don't like the effect (sometimes it is diffi- cult to get it right the first time) just wipe off all the metallic paints with thinner and start over again. Don't settle for anything less than the best you can achieve. The place for your alchemical \"fluid condenser\", if you choose to employ one, is on your cardboard backing. 2. I suggest that you leave it off your first mirror or at least delay applying it until after you have successfully performed operations without it. The reason is this: your subconscious mind is more superstitious than your rational mind is and it will believe that the condenser is an essential part of the process if you start off using it at the beginning of your operations. It is much better to prove to yourself that you can make the magick hap- pen through the power of your mind than to depend on a rabbit's foot or a mojo bag. If you want to add the condenser later, then do so. We have even experimented by charging our rock crystal Almadel ball with a 250,000 volt Vandergraff lightning machine -- but this was only after we knew we didn't need to. 200"},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":"Your mirror should be anchored to the corrugated cardboard backing with several swatches of industrial grade double-sticky tape. (We have found double-sticky tape to be an essential item for practical magick.) The carboard backing is glued to the plywood round. Finally a plastic or metal bezel band is wrapped, glued and screwed in around the edge, holding everything together. (Be sure to drill start holes through the band and into the plywood. No hammering!) Four brass screw eyes must also be attached around the edge (you only need one if you don't intend to suspend your mirror from overhead). The reason why you don't want to permanently mount your mir- ror in your Triangle is that your mirror is also your Pentacle of Art. It is the fourth traditional implement of the Magus, the platter or shield of the Grail Hallows. You will use it for other magical functions besides Goetia skrying. For the reverse side ( the plywood back) you might use the traditional Golden Dawn Earth Pentacle design -- or, if you are more of a Pagan, we suggest the ten-pointed double penta- gram for the Sphere of Malkuth as shown and described below: -- O.TA Magick Mirror -- Reverse side. Earth Pentacle. Colors = Border band: gold, upright pentagram: gold, downward pentagram: silver. Quadrants colors: citrine, olive, russet and black. 201"},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":"You will notice that our pentacle differs from the Golden Dawn version only in the selection of the central design. We use the double pentagram to form a ten-pointed \"Malkuth-Asshia\" decagram appro- priate to the element, the sphere and the dimension. You should also acquire a 3' x 3' square of green silk to wrap up the mirror-pantacle when not in use, or to cover it, as with a veil, before an operation. You may also hang the mirror on the Triangle with the pentacle side out- ward when the equipment is not in use -- but this should only be a tem- porary expedient. The Circle, Altar, Mirror and Triangle are the major items of equipment you will need to construct in order to practice the O.T.A.'s Goetia/ Almadel system. However, you should not neglect the four Archangels of the Quarters. I suggest that you have the color plates of the Angels enlarged and then mounted on icon frames -- such as the ones shown in the video -- with shelves for candles. (They don't have to be as elaborate as ours. Just a board with a shelf at the bottom will do quite well.) Hang them on the four walls of your temple. You can then ceremonially light the Four Quarters as a form of temple opening. If you want to add full size pillars to your temple you will need to find a salvage yard and then spend several days patching, caulking and sanding your forlorn aquisitions -- but eventually Jochin and Boa: will emerge (with the help of black and white enamel, gold and silver leaf and coats of plastic varnish.) Smaller pillars can be created from p.v.c. pipe or even heavy cardboard tubes. The early O.T.A. had its own distinctive magick wand that was derived from a design by Eliphas Levi. We constructed it out of a two foot long decorative wooden spindle of the type used for railings. One half was painted white and the other black. Each end of the spindle was fitted with a cast iron quatrefoil point of the type used to cap wrought iron fences and gates. The white end was pointed forward for invoking and the black end forward for banishing. This allowed the operator to do some artful wand twirling.

We started using u.v. lighting in our temple back in 1970. We use it only for the Holy Names around the Magick Circle and on our planetary septagram design. For this limited purpose it is very effective because it keeps the wards of power and the correspon- dences of the working always visually charged and constantly seen even out of the comer of the eye. The ultraviolet light also lends an otherworldly atmosphere to the temple. It is, in fact, very much like the electric blue of the astral plane. Of course we have been criticized by magicians with far less operative ex- perience who believe that only olive oil lamps and candle light are acceptable to their spirits -- but our spirits seem to enjoy the higher frequencies. We have also experimented with a Vande graff static generator to charge our Almadel rock crystal ball. \"The Orb\" absorbs energy at such a rate that it actually doubles the usual spark gap, creating two foot long lightning bolts. (Such experiments are more common in European lodges than in America.) 2. Fluid condensers are alchemical compounds (either liquid or dry) that attract astral \"fluids\" and hence are used by magicians of the Franz Bardon school to charge their magic(k) mirrors. However, Bardon does not emphisize optical mirrors. He prefers a non- reflective black surface for tantric style visualization. With these non-optic mirrors the condenser is sprinkled directly on the view- ing surface. With O.T.A. style optic mirrors the fluid condenser is sometimes placed behind the mirror as an added reinforcement. I can't say that it does any particular good in our case, but, as long as you don't depend on it, it can be considered an alchem- ical enhancement (See Initiation into Hermetics by F. Bardon.) 203"},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":".9l.ppencf~ 4 Documentatu f£l(fii6its 1. rIfie.9l.rt f4f11UUfe[ of Solomon (tIJirect transcription. from '13.L.

You may even decide to experiment with the original system. Please be encouraged to do so. Because the Almadel from the Lemegeton does not match up with the Goetia Spirits (thus prompting our radical rectification), this does not mean that the old Almadel (or Almarel) system itself is essen- tially flawed. Although somewhat garbled in its Angelic nomenclature, it works well in its own right and the visual effects are spectacular.

By this art Solomon attained great wisdom from the chief angels that govern the four Altitudes of the World: for you must observe that there are four Altitudes which represent the four Altitudes of the West, East, North and South: the which is divided into 12 parts; that is, every part 3. And the Angels of every (one) of these parts hath their particular virtues and powers, as shall be showed in the following matter:- Make this (Eastern) Almadel of pure white wax; but the others must be coloured suitable to the Altitudes. It is to be 4 inches square, and 6 inches over every way, and in every comer a hole, and write 205"},{"pageNumber":215,"pageContent":"betwixt and every hole with a new pen those words and names of God following. But this is to be done in the day and hour of Sol (the Sun). Write upon the first part towards the East, ADONAD, HELOMI, PINE. And upon the second towards the South part HELION, HELOI, HELL And upon the West part JOD, HOD, AGLA. And (on) the Fourth part which is North write TETRAGRAMMATON, SHADAI, JAR. And betwixt the first and the other parts make the pentacle of Solomon thus: '* and betwixt the first quarter write this word ANABONA, and in the middle of the Almadel make a Sexangle fig- ure, and in the middle of it a triangle, wherein must be written these names of God HELL, HELION, ADONAIJ, and this last have round about the six-angled figure, as here it is made for an example (see Lemegeton Almadel MS. facsimile folio page 49.) And of the same wax there must be made four candles. And they must be of the same colour as the Almadel is of. Divide your wax into three parts: one to make the Almadel of, and the other two parts to make the candles of. And let there come forth from every one of them a foot made of the same wax to support the Almadel. (See facsimile folio of the \"Almarel\" from Sepher Maphteah Shelomo.) This being done, in the next place you are to make a seal of pure gold or silver (but gold is best) whereon must be engraved those three names HELION, HELLUION, ADONAIJ. And note that the First Altitude is called Chora Orientis, or the East Altitude. And to make an experiment in this Chora it is to be done in the day and hour of the Sun. And the power and office of those angels is to make all things fruitful, and increase both animals and veg- etables in creation and generation, advancing the birth of children, and making barren women fruitful. And their names are these, viz: ALIMIEL, GABRIEL, BARACHIEL, LEBES, HELISON. And note you must not pray for any angel but those that belong to the Altitude you have a desire to call forth.

He ascends first upon the superscription on the Almadel, as it were a mist or fog. Then must the exorcist have ready a vessel or earth of the same colour as the Almadel is of, and the other of his furniture, it being in the form of a basin, and put thereinto a few hot ashes or coals, but not too much lest it should melt the wax of the Almadel. And put therein three little grains of mastick in powder so that it may fume and the smell go upwards through the holes of the Almadel when it is under it.

Now it will be in vain to call any of the Angels unless it be those that govern them. For every Chora or altitude hath its limited time, according to the twelve signs of the Zodiac; and in that Sign the Sun is in that or those Angels that belong to that Sign hath the government. As, for example: suppose that I would call the 2 fITst or the 5 that belong to the first Chora. Then choose the first Sunday in March, after the Sun hath entered Aries: and then I make an experiment. And so do the like, if you will, the next Sunday after again. And if you will call the two second that belong to the first Chora,that Sunday after the Sun enters Taurus in April. But if you will call the last of the 5, then you must take those Sundays that are in May after the Sun has entered Gemini, to make your experiment in. Do the like in the other Altitudes, for they have all one way of working. But the Altitudes have names formed severally in the sub- stance of the heavens, even a character. For when the Angels hear the names of God that is attributed to them, they hear it by virtue of that character. Therefore it is in vain to call any angel or spirit unless he knows what name to call him by.

Although a case can also be made for the Tetractys relating to the Tetragrammaton, e.g. Y, YH, YHV, YHVH, and this when extended produces the Shemhameforash or 72 letter Name. 3. This seems to be independent of the Sepher Yetziran which does not deal with the Tetragrammaton concept. Whether this is a later derivation from the same source ( the Tetractys ) or a 'deep structure' synchronism, might be debated but direct Pythagorean influence on the Yetzirah seems fairly obvious. 4. However comfortable it might be to concede that the Aleph, Mem and Shin generative trilogy in the Sepher Yetziran derived from the Pythagorean-Platonic 'Point' (1.) 'Line' (2.) 'Triangular Plane' (3.) 'Primordial solid'(4.) ( tetrahedron) creation concept, 5. when we carry this into the realm of the \"Practical Kabbalah\" we find ourselves faced with what may well be a disturbing reassessment. It appears that we have uncovered one of the secrets of \"Solomon's Triangle of Art\" as delineated in the Goetia of the Lemegeton. 6. - and if so, we might have to concede that some medieval ceremonial magicians were not such ignorant louts and bumpkins as Arthur Edward Waite would have us believe. 7. What I am suggesting is that the medieval \"Triangle of Art\" was a philosophical-mystical spiritus locus par excellence, not simply in its triangular configuration but in its entire design. Before considering the ramifications, let us reflect on the compelling elegance of the tetra- hedron in relation to Ceremonial Magic. Aleph, Mem and Shin (the triangular plane) generate a hypothetical fourth point, which trans- forms the triangle into a solid (this single point in the Sepher Yetzirali alphabet system would translate directly to the Seven Double Letters as they relate to the six dimensions plus the center point of space.) What better model could we possibly construct to symbolize the cre- ative process (from Atzilutb to Briah ), leaving the manipulation of Yetziran forms to the magician ? 215"},{"pageNumber":225,"pageContent":"On studying Solomon's triangle further, we note that the focal disc in the center is \"green\" (an Earth attribute) and that the English or Latin letters Mi , Ch, Ael (Michael) surround it at the three angles. Michael, greatest of the Archangels, forerunner of the Shekinali and the Angel of the Burning Bush certainly relates to Shin, which, with its three seriphs, was used as a code glyph to repre- sent the Supernal Triad of the Otz Chiim in later Zoharic notation. 10. This transmutation of symbols is certainly allowable by the 17th Century but it is my contention that if we could uncover the original Spanish-Hebrew Lemegeton that Weirus and later scholars date to the 13th Century, we would probably discover the Letters Aleph (yellow), Mem (blue) and Shin (red) surrounding and 'generating' the green disc in the center. 11. In further considering the significance of the 'green disc', we should not avoid a reconstruction of how the Triangle Of Art must have been employed in actual practice - but because the prevailing opinion of medieval magicians is so universally low, no scholar has bothered to consider it beyond a general assumption that it was an area over which hallucinations were supposed to occur (induced by fasting, hysterical conjurations, toxic fumes, etc.) It is interesting to note that in Crowley's published version of the Goetia, the Triangle is described or 'quoted' as being positioned, \"Two feet distant from the Magical Circle and it is three feet across.\"12. A. E. Waite's version, however, is almost correct: \"Two feet outside this circle and three feet over it.\" 13. The actual quotation from Sloane MS. 2731 reads: \"Two foot off from the Circle and three foot over,\" Neither Waite nor Crowley seem to have been aware of what to do with the Triangle even though Waite's rendering was correct. (It should be noted, however, that Mathers, and later Crowley, were work- ing from a Latin MS. in the British Museum and not the English Sloane 2731 as was Waite.) In Waite's case, he apparently did not care and in Crowley's case he obviously did not know. 14. I make bold to suggest that the medieval magicians who devel- oped and practiced this system were perhaps more mature and sophis- ticated in their approach to the ac~al method than Crowley was even 216"},{"pageNumber":226,"pageContent":"though his psychological forward to his version of the Goetia is the very antithesis of credulity, Crowley's operational methods are totally romantic - but this is perhaps consistent on some abstract level of Simonian Gnostic (Thelemic) paradox that we benighted 'monists' are not privileged to understand. 15. Rejecting the 'smoke' method and taking a more pragmatic approach to the problem, we will erect our triangle \"Two feet out and three feet over\", as specified, and then place one of \"the seven plane- tary metal mirrors\" cited by E. Wallis Budge, 16. on our 'green disc' and then, holding a pair of, candles, we stare at our own reflection in the manner Tantric adepts employ to evoke visions of previous incar- nations, 17. while our Magus stands behind us, intoning the conjura- tion, and we have a method that works. 18. Before we declare this method a modem synthetic (which is the opinion of Francis Regardie 19.) we should perhaps consider that if our medieval magicians were philosophical enough to adopt the Pythagorean- Yetziratic Triangle symbolism, if they believed in the microcosm-macrocosm analogy, if they held that God created man in His own image, and if their Triangle was elevated rather than flat, it would seem probable that something like my suggested method was employed. The Seventy-two Spirits of the Brass Vessel might then have constituted a microcosmic (internalized) counterpoint to the Seventy-two Angels of the Shemhameforash. Considering the Gnostic influence on the Sepher Yettirali and on the later Kabbalah, we should perhaps consider the following Mandaean passage cited by Hans Jonas: -- \"Abathur (one of the Uthras plotting the creation of the world) goes into that world (of darkness) ... He sees his face in the black water.\" This son is Ptahil-Uthra, the actual demiurge of this world. This example from an area so far removed from the intellec- tual environment in which Plotinus met his Gnostics shows how persistently the act of mirroring is conceived in Gnostic literature as the production of an alter ego, and at the same time how closely this is connected with cosmogony.- Hans Jonas. The Gnostic Religion, 1958. 217"},{"pageNumber":227,"pageContent":"And for a broader perspective we may tum to Frazer's Golden Bough where we read, \"As some peoples believe a man's soul to be in his shadow, so other (or the same) peoples believe it to be in water or in a mirror.\" 20. Carrying this theme into the realm of Jewish folklore, we find the following in Trachtenberg; \"If a woman at the commence- ment of her period stares fixedly into a bright metal mirror she will behold in it a drop of blood, for the demon that is in her glance creates an evil influence in the air which adheres to the mirror ... \" 21. We should note that our 'green disc' and the Magick Mirror we place upon it - which is the Pantacle of Art, attributed to Earth - represents a direct theoretical parallel to the original visionary Golem operation. This may be our best argument for a Jewish over an Arabian origin of the Lemegeton. 22. Whether or not the system I have described was used in medieval and renaissance ceremonial magick is of little consequence to its modem effectiveness, which, from a Jungian psychological viewpoint, is startling. I and my associates have not thought it wise to broadly exploit this method due to the danger that might be incurred through its mis- use by the immature and the impressionable - especially in conjunc- tion with psychoactive drugs (which we do not employ in our opera- tions). I have presented the above for your private consideration in your professional capacity and I trust that these matters will remain in confidence. 23· 9{{Jtes on 1(a66aCali 5lppenab(; 1.

(1995 note:) the Lemegeton is actually a later, possibly 17th century, compendium of five books on magick. The Goetia and the Almadel are probably the oldest and could date back to the 13th century. Both systems as we have them are probably of Spanish origin but, in the case of the Goetia, the Arabian influence is very strong (see C.J.S. Thompson's The Mysteries and Secrets of Magic p. 89) and there is early Christian influence in the references to former angelic orders such as \"Dominions\", Thrones\", \"Virtues\", etc. which were accepted by the Hermetic Kabbalists according to Frances Yates. (see Giordano Bruno and the Hermetic Tradition, Chap. VI.) 23. In 1974 on NBC's Tomorrow Show, hosted by Tom Snyder, we showed a film clip of a Goetia operation in progress. The upright triangle, supporting the dark mirror, was briefly displayed. The receiver, holding the evocation candles, was visible with myself, as operator, standing behind her. The method would have been obvious to any one with a knowledge of magick but not to the general public. We were neither exploiting the dark mirror tech- nique, nor making a secret of it.

However, what I can and will do is provide you with a list of the best books for practical exercises, study and reference. I will also suggest what to avoid in order to keep you ON THE PATH. First I'm going to layout a short \"crash course\" for those who want to get started quickly: Read my Magick and Hypnosis and Negative vs. Positive Gnosis then go directly to the. practical manuals: for self-hypnosis, Leslie M. LeCron's Self Hypnotism: The Technique and its Use in Daily Living. For Raja Yoga (pranayama, tratakam, etc.) Dr Rammutri Mishra's Fundamentals of Yoga. These books are modem classics and usually in print or otherwise available. If you can't locate them, a professional book search service will quickly find them for you. For a concise practical survey of Western Magick The Black Arts by Richard Cavendish is still the best. It is has been through sev- eral editions and is back in print at this writing. As for Grimoires, the only three you really need at the outset are the Mathers/Crowley Goetia (the new 2nd edition from Samuel Weiser is recommended) and the Mathers' Key of Solomon the King (also from Weiser). The latter is essential for talismans and equipment 222"},{"pageNumber":232,"pageContent":"decoration, etc., and Francis Barrett's The Magus. This book has a bad reputation among scholars because the author lifted so much material from earlier sources but it is still the best compendium of arcane lore for the beginning magician. (Later you may want to collect separate editions of Barrett's source works such as Agrippa's Three Books of Occult Philosophy, etc.) For Kabbalah there are two books that I consider essential. Fortunately they are both short, concise and as clearly written as pos- sible considering the complexity of the subject: Kabbalah by Charles Ponce and A Garden of Pomegranates by Francis Israel Regardie. For an operational reference handbook you will need some ver- sion of Crowley's 777. (Contrary to popular myth, the main corres- pondences have not been Thelemized. It is still basically the Golden Dawn system.) The above listed monographs and books form the \"bare-bones basic library\" to back up the Solomonic system taught in this book. Of course you are going to be interested in further reading and research. Let me caution you about two major traps you may encounter: the first is the \"Eastern Masters\" or \"Great White Brotherhood\" theme. Back in the 1880's Helena Blavatsky promoted her unique version of Sikh Sant and Buddhist religion under the guise of a super-ancient Tibetan system (she was apparently protecting her Sikh sponsors in Kashmir. In the late 1800's the British and the Russians were fighting a \"Cold War\" on the Indian frontier.) If you become glamorized by this modem myth you will be seduced away from a straight course toward Western adeptship. The extensive influence of Theosophy in occultism also presents a continuous veracity problem for the Western magical student who needs to explore and understand both Eastern and Western magical systems. Several of the books we recommend are actually published by the Theosophical Society (Quest Books). The best rule is too under- stand the principles of your own tradition and those of the Eastern sys- tems from the purest source material you can find -- then you, your- self, can decide where they differ and where they agree. The second pitfall you should avoid is a headlong rush into the Enochian system. Because Enochian is presently so popular, and 223"},{"pageNumber":233,"pageContent":"because both the Golden Dawn and the Thelemic (O.T.O.) systems use it, there is a tendency to include Enochian conjurations, Watchtower Opening procedures, etc. in beginning texts on magick without any qualification as to the special nature of the Enochian sys- tem. Donald Michael Kraig's Modem Magick is an example of this trend but he is not alone. Avoid a commitment to Enochian until you have a good idea of what Western Magick is all about - then decide whether or not you want to experiment with it. (I have studied and practiced Enochian magick for many years. 1 made my own set of Watchtower Tablets and have even channeled some original Enochian material. The O.T.A. operation that Geoffrey James recounts in Chapter Nine of his Angel Magic was Enochian - but I am very much aware that Enochian is not the only Western system. It is not nec- essarily 'bad' or especially dangerous but when beginning students ask me about it, 1 usually tell them that \"There are no warm fuzzies in Enochian\". Enochian entities don't love you. In many case they don't even like you. Therefore beginning students should not be maneuvered or tricked into practicing the system before they are ready to make their own knowledgeable commitments.) The same rule applies in some respects to the Golden Dawn sys- tem itself. Westcott and Mathers gave us the greatest synthesis of Western esoteric lore since Agrippa in the mid-1500s. We use their cor- respondences and color scales in the O.T.A. but this does not mean that we, or anyone for that matter, has to be bound by the Victorian-age restrictions that hobbled their magick. (We should mention that sever- al modem Golden Dawn adepts are very much aware of these Victorian handicaps and now support a return to Renaissance meth- ods. The Ciceros use dark mirrors and Pat Zalewski employs an obsid- ian orb in his Enochian operations.) You should certainly get Regardie's The Golden Dawn (the 6th edition has an index) and use it as a reference tool at the very least. Going through the grades of the Golden Dawn is not unlike earning a degree from a university. Dedicated magicians should certainly consider the advantages. No serious discussion of the art magical would be complete without considering the contributions and the impact of Aleister Crowley. On the good side he brought magick into the twentieth cen- 224"},{"pageNumber":234,"pageContent":"tury as a vital artistic and intellectual force rather than a quaint anachronism. He was a freedom loving romantic out to liberate the long-repressed Faustian-Promethean shadow underlying the Western psyche. Unlike Westcott, Mathers and even Blavatsky, he did not hide behind smoke screens of ancient mythology. He boldy created his own religion, declared himself its prophet and set out to conquer the world with a declaration that discovering and pursuing one's \"True Will\" should be the most important single factor in human life. This philos- ophy is especially attractive to magicians and the word \"Magick\" (using the Renaissance spelling) became almost synonomous with Crowley himself. On the down-side, he was extravagantly amoral and suffered from multiple substance addiction. In the 1970's, cult-worship of Crowley, especially the glorification of his faults and weaknesses over his virtues, continued to distort the true purpose of his teachings. For a quarter of a century following his 1947 demise, Crowley's lurid pub- lic image tainted his legacy. However, by the time of this writing his Ordo Templi Orientis has matured into the elite and respected magi- cal sodality it was originally intended to be. Crowley's Book of The Law may now be accepted as a subjective declaration of personal freedom rather than a manifesto for social anarchy. No student of mod- em Magick should consider his or her education complete without at least reading Crowley's Magick in Theory and Practice. Finally we come to the Bardonian system. You were introduced to it in The Evocation of Nithael. Franz Bardon was a European magus who flourished in the years directly before and after WW II. He was a professional stage hypnotist, a devotee of Rudolph Steiner and a prac- titioner of both Raja and Tantric yoga. Like Julius Evola, he forged links between the Hermetic and Eastern systems. Bardon's books suf- fer from stilted translation. One of my late colleagues would read pas- sages from Bardon aloud in a thick German accent for a humorous effect - but regardless of Bardon's quaint style and dogmatically superstitious approach, he had a profound practical and theoretical knowledge of magick and his is still the best training program for the solitary practitioner who wishes to devote his or her life to the magi- cal art. Bardon demands a major long-term commitment in which the 225"},{"pageNumber":235,"pageContent":"student, through a series of intense concentration exercises, will literally transform himself into a magical adept as powerful and (hopefully) as enlightened as any Tibetan Lama. Franz Bardon's road is not an easy one. He tells the stu- dent exactly what must be accomplished in mastering each of his steps but often he does not explain how to do it. Bardon's first book, Initiation into Hermetics, is actually more of an out- line for a course of study than a complete program. It requires the additional mastery of self-hypnosis along with Raja and Tantric Yoga. The O.T.A. Solomonic program is an excellent prerequisite to Bardon, providing one realizes that Bardon demands evocation from a non-reflective \"mirror\". When you get to this stage you can no longer fall back on the optical phe- nomenon of facial reflection/distortion in the mirror or the auric halo around the crystal that make our O.T.A. operations so easy in the beginning. Bardon's magick is for the advanced student who, having completed our Goetial Almadel program, is ready to accept a long term regime of personal magical development. Bardon's first and second volumes are excellent. However, his Key to the True Quabbalah (3) and Frabato (4) are perhaps too divergent from the British-American magical point of view. Look to Bardon for method and technique but for system architecture and magical philosophy you might be better advised to explore Classical and Renaissance Hermetism and Neoplatonism, starting with the works of the late Frances Yates, such as Giordano Bruno and the Hermetic Tradition. For the most concise and accessible selection of Carl Jung's own work I suggest Modern Man in Search of a Soul and for a true perspective on ancient Middle-Eastern Paganism underlying the kabbalah I recommend The Hebrew Goddess by Raphael Patai. 226"},{"pageNumber":236,"pageContent":"'Bi6[iograpli!J: Note: Those books we consider important for you to read, study and/or have available for reference are listed in bold typeface.

It also represents the psychic structure of the Magical Universe in the lower Yetzirah or astral plane. The sequence of both the 72 Goetia Spirits of the Brass Vessel and the higher 72 Angels of the Schemhamephorash both start in the first quinance (five degree segment) of the first decan of Aires. The two linked sets (Angels and Spirits) continue their matched progression together through the signs in harmony with the general scheme of tropical astrology. The dates when each particular Spirit is exalted are listed in the notes following the Spirit's description in the text. For Almadel Invocation operations, the Master Mandala should be mounted in the center of the top of the double-cube incense altar. The first Spirit, Bae1 (Ba' al), should be facing due East, with Astaroth (Astarte) due West. (This can also be \"mag- ical\" East and West if your temple is not so aligned.) A crystal orb on an openwork stand is placed in the cen- ter of the Mandala as the visual focal point for the operation. The crystal is to be covered with a white silken cloth when not In use. The proper incense for each summoning is determined by the fourth ring from the center of the Mandala, the planetary attributes of the Spirits. This symbol also determines the Spirit's kabbalistic sephira (within Yesod), e.g. Bael (Ba' al) a \"King\" = Sun (8) = frankincense. This attribute likewise determines the number of circumambulations. In our example: \"Six turns deosil in the Sphere of Tiphareth of Yesod.\" The Master Mandala is not used directly in Goetia Evocation operations but the corropondances are followed, e.g. Michael, Vehuiah, Goap, Bael (Ba'al). In this sequence the Triangle is placed outside the Southern Quadrant. 232"},{"pageNumber":243,"pageContent":"Jfe dVt9 ~st't\\· JVt9 ~ ~~~,~ ©1996 by C. R. Run yon"}]
