W HAT are the Secret Rituals of the Men in Black, you ask yourself. Does this book actually give them away? Is it an exposure, like an - other book of Secret Rituals that came out over three decades ago? Or other such exposures that come out every few decades, since the need arose in men’s minds to have a glimpse at the inner workings of the Secret Club? Will we become aware of just who or what the dreaded Men in Black are, where they come from, or where they spend their time? In order to answer these questions, let us pres - ent some ideas that shed “further light” on these two ideas: Secret Rituals, and Men in Black. To start, I must say that this book has not been offered anywhere before — in print, or on the web, save for a small portion of it, in the form of the chapter on Jack Parsons, which appeared on the Brother Blue site, and was carried in an early number of the Grey Lodge Occult Review in 2002, and offered in Roots of Magick: 1700 thru 2000 . It is with great pleasure that we offer this important work to the public . Secret Rituals Secret Rituals are Rituals that have not been exposed. The Rituals of certain organi - zations that have been published are no longer secret—whether we are talking about various Masonic organizations, Rosicrucian Orders, the Golden Dawn, Crowley’s A. A., the O. T. O., T. O. P. Y., or any other. The rituals published by Morgan, by Blanchard, and others are no longer secret. Those offered for sale by Kessinger are no longer secret. The rituals published by Aleister Crowley, Israel Regardie, and Francis King, Naylor and Koenig are no longer secret. Does that mean that the efficacy is lost once the clichéd cat is let out of the proverbial bag? Of course not. As Allen has mentioned, in the present book, and in other places, armchair ritual - izing does not make one an initiate. One must experience the Rituals in order for them to be effective. Not only that, as organizations grow and develop, the rites and practices should reflect that growth and development. Failure to Initiate is a “fatal error” — and more than one Initiate has, through the years warned the Brethren about it. Fresh material needs to be infused regularly over time into the body of the organization — any organization, if its Initiation procedure is going to remain fresh, vital, and relevant to the society it exists in and which forms the base that it draws its"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"Allen H. Greenfield xiv membership from. Say it isn’t so? Look around you. Guess again. NEXT! What, then, are the Secret Rituals exposed here? For starters, this book is not so much an exposure as it is a signpost pointing the way. The way? The WAY! This is the Path. The Path involves Contact. Communication with that OTHER portion. The Other Side. The claptrap of gestures, signs and handshakes, secret languages, ciphers, pass-words, mnemonic data that is supposed to be memorized so that one can pass an exam that maybe even the examiner is ignorant of, without the answer key, are all worthless unless it is realized that it is all outer trappings, devoid of any value or significance at all unless viewed in the Light of the experience of Contact. What is the “Knowledge and Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel” after all? Contact! Con-Tact!! So, then, would it be fair to say that those Rituals which facilitate the Knowledge and Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel, such as the “Bornless” Ritual, the Augoeides layer of the Z-2 formulae, Levi’s Conjuration of the Four and other rituals that exist along these lines — are Secret Rituals? Even if they are in-print and exposed many times over? Yes. What gives? Didn’t I just say that publication exposes once-held secrets and ren - ders them ineffective? True, I did. However, there is an exception to that rule, and that has to do with a cycle of rituals that are very personal and private affairs — that involve the development of the self so that it can communicate with the Self, and achieve that Indwelling, the Day Spring from on High, as the ancients called it. A group of people can go out to Joshua Tree (or similar popular remote places) — ingest all the entheogens they want, and do the sing-song repetition of rituals writ - ten by Somebody Else, and inflate their egos and accomplish little more. It is really necessary in this racket, to develop one’s own shtick — to forge one’s act in isolation. Such is the life of the Hermit. Walk softly, but carry a big shtick . Such is the saying of the Mad Prophet. To find one’s link with the Infinite, and to contact that and to communicate with it: such is the Law! A shorthand illustration is called for here. Perhaps the most basic ritual in the Western Esoteric Tradition is the Pentagram Ritual. Lesser or Greater, it matters little. The Ritual is far more than merely a “protective circle casting” as some would have it. It facilitates Contact, if used as the basic template from which to develop the fully-blown rituals that we get in the Z-2 and other formulae. It is, in effect, a form of Kawwanah , or mystical prayer-meditation employed by Kabbalists for centuries. The Ritual as we have it, comes to us from the Golden Dawn cycle of rituals and knowledge lectures. However, its distant parent was the “Conjuration of the Four” published by Eliphas Levi. The Conjuration of the Four is a Ritual used by the Her - metic Brotherhood of Luxor, in its Initiation ceremonies. It, too, is a development of an earlier cycle of rituals, employed by its predecessors in the Fratres Lucis, and before that, the Asiatic Brethren. These, in their turn, go back to the Gold Rosicru - cians AND THE authentic Kabbalah, embodied in the teachings and practices of"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"Secret Rituals of the Men In Black xv Jacob Frank, Sabbatai Zevi, and so forth, ultimately taking us to the dawn of Kab - balah in the Languedoc, when Isaac the Blind of Posquières and his circle achieved communication with Elijah on the Day of Atonement early in the 12th Century of the Common Era. For more on this, we recommend Allen’s book, Roots of Magick: 1700 thru 2000 — as well as some of the material to be found on the Antiquities of the Illuminati website (www.antiqillum.com) I, too, have my own Secret Rituals. These are based upon the foundation ritual of the Western Esoteric Tradition, the Lesser Ritual of the Pentagram, as modified by Aleister Crowley. These Rituals, developed over the years, are effective, particularly since I HAVE NOT exposed them to the public, particularly to the email forum public, that splits hairs over juvenile trivia and pushes people away who may actually have more to offer at the table than the flatulence that is generally the rule of the day. Such are those who make a lot of noise, and have the audacity to accuse those who have something to say of making noise but possessing no signal. In a place where the signal is dead to begin with, the old saw applies: the pot calling the kettle black. Some of these “Secret Rituals” are exposed in part, however, in the artwork that illustrates these works, and “valuable to those who can read between the lines” — as it were. At some point we may lift a corner of the veil to the sanctuary for a little while. Men in Black Who, then, are the Men in Black? In the context explored here, they are the great Mystery men of the Authentic Tradition, in part; and they can also be those entities or forces that show up or are summoned forth in rituals of Ceremonial Magick, in part. In addition, in the classical UFOlogy model, they are those mysterious beings that usually appear in threes, arriving out of nowhere, for the purpose of silencing those who would go public with knowledge about UFOs. UFOlogists, for the most part, do not like the Men in Black. They constitute a pestilence. They create mis - chief. They steal pictures. At the outset of the project I embarked upon, to make these two books of Allen’s available to the public, it was made clear that we wanted to avoid the typical stereo - typing that the Men in Black get in the publishing world, on the web, in movies and so forth. So, this is not going to be that particularly delightful episode of the X-Files with the black Cadillacs appearing out of nowhere. No black Cadillacs, or any other old vehicles of a similar cast. No groups of three men wearing black suits from the forties. Darn, I love those black suits. I have my own. I get into Jewish weddings and don’t have to don the yarmika! Is it any coincidence that the Magician’s clothing usually consists of a black robe, cap, and other accoutrements? Seriously, though, there is a lineage involved. It is that which is pointed to here in this book. Sometimes it involves the classical Western personalities who get placed on the lists of saints and grand masters. Sometimes it includes other personalities. Personalities perhaps less well-known than those in the tourist literature. Person -"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"Allen H. Greenfield xvi alities that are mentioned in this book, thereby allowing the interested student to research them on their own time. A few words now, on a related subject. That subject is the “Johannite Tradition” — a tradition I have been researching, writing about and practicing for nearly fifteen years, and one which Allen has been researching, writing about and practicing for decades. Unbeknownst to each other, we have formed a very wide definition for what is termed “Johannite” — not merely the Johannism that is usually applied to an obscure Templar revival of the late 18th / early 19th centuries. Our Johannism goes back to the beginnings of “contacteeism” on Planet Earth. True, it’s been written about, but without the nomenclature, by Zecharia Sitchin in his Earth Chronicles series. We would be foolish to hold that series to be the source, however, for our research. Instead, we have drawn from the sources he employed, where we can find or gain access to them. We recognize the value of the various franchise works like that: they point to the sources. We first read of the Oannes in The 12th Planet . We also read of it in works on Masonry and the Western Esoteric Tradition, like Manly Palmer Hall’s Secret Teachings of All Ages , Mackenzie’s Royal Masonic Cyclopaedia , and other sources like that. Later, we ran across allusions to it in Holy Blood, Holy Grail (or works based on it, such as GENISIS , by David Wood) in reference to the Neptunian Quinotaur, the marine animal that impregnated the mother of the first Merovingian king. We also came across a large amount of the source material in Shklovskii’s and Sagan’s book, Intelligent Life in the Universe ; some writings of H. P. Lovecraft dealing with the rites associated with Dagon; and other things. By the time we finally obtained a copy of The Sirius Mystery , we had already seen earlier source materials. What became clear to me, and a bone of contention with many who prefer to disagree out of stubbornness, is that the names given to the Oannes, Annedotus, et al., are etymologically related to the name Jonathan, and not so much to the name John. The name Jonathan meaning YAH HAS GIVEN; the name John meaning the name GOD IS GRACIOUS. We had run across the name of Jon in an apocryphal letter to a Brazilian Mason and it piqued our curiosity. Later we found that the name was important, in a different form as Dositheos, the successor of that other John — John the Baptist, and predecessor to Simon Magus, said to be the fountainhead of the Gnosis. This is all familiar territory for those who have read my writings on the subject so I must write in shorthand, since this is just an introductory essay. When I obtained copies of Crowley texts that I had not possessed before my access to the internet commenced, I found that indeed, the name John was employed in a very auspicious manner in not only a “Secret Ritual” but in a Mystery Play — a Play that bears a relationship to a series of engravings and paintings, by Poussin, Madathanus, Lambert and others. I am pleased to see that I am not the only person who has reached these conclu - sions — conclusions that when they were detective’s hunches seemed outrageous and far-fetched."},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"Secret Rituals of the Men In Black xvii Recap As a recap to the ideas I expressed in the first part of this introduction, namely that of the evolution of ritual, and the personalization of ritual for the purpose of achiev - ing that contact, I can say that Qadosh: the Johannite Tradition is truly one of those Secret Rituals, and a key teaching to those who seek to find their place in the scheme of things pertaining to “the Path”.

Sir Knights, the mystery which unites us is a mystery of mourn - ing and sadness. From the debris which escaped the great universal cata - clysm, the sacred deposit of our traditions has perished; science has flown towards the heavens and the word is lost.” Opening of the Chapter of Rose Croix, Rite of Memphis “Conduct the Aspirant...that he may be instructed in our Secret Cypher, after which let him be seated.” Grand Pontiff, Secret Ritual of the 64° “Sage of Mythras”, Masonic Rite of Memphis F OR skeptics and believers alike, the secret rituals of occultism, and later, of trance mediumship, have always been something of a puzzle. In the early 19th Century one Captain Morgan revealed some of these secrets to the world, and was apparently executed for doing so. The scandal thus set in motion resulted for a time in the Anti-Masonic Party becoming the second largest political party in the United States. Surprisingly, the rituals Morgan (and later others) revealed disclosed little more, on the surface, than simple morality plays which climaxed with the communication of certain secret words and gestures, of no obvious importance. Yet, the communication of these secrets took place only after the candidates for admission swore an oath of secrecy, often accompanied with dire threats for betrayal. The Masonic degrees, those of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn and other, similar ceremonial bodies seemed hardly to justify such threats, viewed in the cold light of day. We find the same pattern emerging in trance mediumship and UFO contacteeism where, with much fanfare, ‘spirits’ or ‘aliens’ emerge from spaceships or from The Great Beyond to tell percipients merely their names and where they came from. If there is any ‘message’ at all, it usually consisted of advice to live in peace. The reason for all these profoundly bizarre goings-on became apparent only when we “cracked” the key secret cipher used in such rituals and spontaneous encounters. Once realized, a bizarre design, previously suspected by only a few diverse researchers working in widely differing fields, was fully exposed. It revealed an intricate world - wide pattern of communication between Ultraterrestrial Forces almost totally be - yond our comprehension and human adepts, stretching from remote antiquity to the present moment. The real question should be, “Why wasn’t this obvious far earlier than our pres - ent discoveries?” Freemasonry - particularly so-called ‘fringe’ Freemasonry such as that of various Egyptian Rites and its predecessors in Rosicrucian Occultism and the Ancient Mystery Religions always offered a series of graded initiations, including"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"Allen H. Greenfield 2 secret words and cipher languages, and an altogether unique view of the universe. The emphasis was on the relationship between humanity and Higher Powers, the Stars, and a Supreme Force sometimes referred to as the “Architect of all worlds”. The mythic plays and planetary origin stories all seem to have a double meaning, and that meaning is hidden in the secret pass words and strange names (and strange spellings of conventional names), which were, in fact, coded messages . These messages spoke of Aeons-old communication between human and Ultraterrestrial forces warring for control of the Earth. The highest-ranking public initiate-adept known by the present writer, Rev. Michael Bertiaux of Chicago, has long maintained that the (Egyptian) Rite of Mem - phis-Misraim was a “front” (in a sense) for Ultraterrestrial technology. As a Conserva - tor and Hierophant of a distinct branch of these rites, he would surely know, and our findings, reinforced by extensive ‘hands on’ knowledge of Masonic and Cryptoma - sonic ritual—as well as the Secret Cipher of the UFOnauts itself, clearly demonstrates that Bishop Bertiaux’s assertion is nothing less than the straightforward truth. Legends and lore surrounding the Star Sirius figure heavily into our premise. In distant times, in the days of ancient Sumer in Mesopotamia, predynastic Egypt in Africa, Dravidian India and in Mexico long before the Mayans, there is a fairly con - sistent account of God-like and perhaps amphibious beings from the sky sometimes associated with the Constellations Cancer and Orion, and with the Star Sirius in the constellation Canis Major, or “The Great Dog.” They visited Earth, establishing a nucleus of priest-kings and scientists who have carried forth a secret tradition of contact, communication and Ultraterrestrial overlordship — and rebellion against that overlordship. This tradition is displayed in various rituals through myth and cipher, but, in addition, certain ‘sacred technologies’ are conveyed for reestablishing communication (should a link be broken), for actual travel to and from Ultraterres - trial realms, and even indicate in minute detail how to effectively resist alien influ - ence. The entire literature of magical invocation and evocation, seen in this light, is revealed to be a disguised transmission of these technologies. It is, to quote an old commentary on the 60th Degree of the Rite of Memphis, “a part of the instruction of the priest of old—the Mysterious Key which opens the forgotten intelligence of the world of light and truth, and joins the finite to the infinite.” This system demonstrates why such powerful forces remain hidden and have not overwhelmed us; we have allies, and perhaps a Secret or two . “The principal aim of this order is the perfection of man, and his reapproachment towards that source whence it emanated; that is to say his rehabilitation and reintegration in his primitive rights...” the candidate for admission is informed in the 64th Degree of the Rite of Memphis by the Orator. It would seem to apply not just to the Rite of Memphis, but to a secret great order of light that has existed as long as we have.

The Merovingian lineage in legend is traced back to the Frankish King, Meroveus, rumored from early times to be the son of the wife of King Claudio and an aquatic being from beyond the known seas known as the “ bestea Neptuni Quinotauri similis ”. As we shall presently demonstrate, this legend of a line of priest-kings inaugu - rated by an intelligent aquatic creature from the far unknown recurs through all of recorded history, from ancient Sumer to modern stories of UFOnauts and Men in Black.

It would not be within the appropriate scope of this work to go into a detailed description of the transcription of The Book of the Law , but a brief background de - scription is certainly necessary. In the Spring of 1904 the already controversial occultist Aleister Crowley was on an extended honeymoon with his wife Rose in Cairo, Egypt. Following some fore - shadowing events, Crowley was moved to take dictation from a “ præterhuman intelli - gence” identifying itself as “Aiwass” for one hour each day from Noon to 1:00 PM for three consecutive days, April 8th, 9th and 10th. During this hour, Aiwass, a more or less visible presence behind Crowley, dictated a chapter a day for what was to become Liber AL vel Legis or The Book of the Law . The Book is described as a Holy Book of the New Aeon, or New Age, then just arriving. It is, as a text, vivid, compelling, shocking and altogether unique. It can be read through in a single sitting. It is not our task here to discuss further the merit of the Book itself. Other English language “trance channeled” materials were coming forth during the same period; The Cosmic Philosophy of Max Theon and his wife Alma Ware appeared during this same period, being also of North African origin. Oahspe appeared in New York a few years earlier. But, whatever else it is, the Aiwass book was and is quite unique. Here we should confine ourselves to a single peculiarity of the Book. Several pas - sages therein imply strongly that a hidden cipher or key existed within the text, which, it predicts, Crowley himself would never discover. Despite this, at one point Crowley seems to have tried anyway. Of interest is a single page of the handwritten original manuscript, numbered page 16 of the third chapter. In addition to the hastily written text, which suggests the taking of dictation by one somewhat unused to secretarial functions, is a curious diagonal line running roughly from the upper left to lower right of the page, and a sort of cross, or plus sign (+) enclosed within a circle. The text, cross and line all seem to have been written with the same pen at the same time, and both cross and line are specifically mentioned in the text itself. (“Then this line drawn is a key: then this circle squared in its failure is 1. Aiwass was not Crowley’s only contact. There is considerable discussion in UFOlogy of LAM, the being Crowley sketched that so closely resembled later UFO-related beings described in modern close en - counter cases. His encounter, in 1896, with two “little men” in the Swiss Alps was mentioned in Jacques Vallee’s Passport to Magonia catalogue of close encounter cases. Crowley’s “magical mountain” — Mt. Mealfuorvonie near Loch Ness in Scotland — is said to be a UFOnaut base."},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"Allen H. Greenfield 6 a key also.”) However, in addition there is a grid superimposed over the entire page, consist - ing of seven vertical and nine horizontal lines. The top row has a series of letters, a through h, and, except for the upper left hand square, a series of numbers, 2 through 10 appear on the extreme left of the page. This grid was superimposed at a later date with another writing instrument. The page number, 16, in the upper right square, was added on yet a third occasion. It is very easy to conclude that Crowley - though the text itself suggests he would not succeed in finding “the key of it all” — apparently attempted to do so, with no success. The Book predicts that “one cometh after him” who would succeed. This is gener - ally conceded to refer to Crowley’s student C.S. Jones, who did indeed uncover a key to the text some years later. The cipher or ‘code’ implied by the key was recorded by Jones in his magical diary for October 31st, 1918. A careful reading of this footnote reveals that the letters A,L and W, in some sequence, form the first three letters of a cipher. Since the number Eleven is more than hinted at in The Book of the Law itself as a ‘key’ it theoretically is easy enough to note that, in standard alphabetical sequence, there are eleven spaces between A and L, and another eleven between L and W. But many decades were to pass before a group in England calling itself the OAA, and its American counterpart, QBLH, were to complete the sequence and “obtain the order and value of the English Alphabet” as called for in The Book of the Law itself. “This key we have been considering,” says an article in Thelema in 1980, “can be understood from either of two courses. 11 is the number of Magick, and when we number every 11th letter of the Alphabet, we arrive with ALW...P.” The article, signed “D.P. AL” goes on to explain the other method, using the grid in the original manuscript described above. “...when we complete all of the squares with the Alphabet, and carefully consider that the diagonal line is a Key herein, we shall again find the “order and value.’’ How this is done is described in an article from the same period by Carol Smith, writing in the British journal New Equinox . “There are letters along the top of the page, and it would seem to be obvious to continue with the alphabet in the manner indicated, but the clue is in the numbers down the side. A is written instead of 1 which suggests that B is 2, C 3 and so on. Fill in all the squares on the grid in this manner, repeating the alphabet when one gets to Z. To proceed to the next step the instruction is written on the page, for those who have eyes to see. ‘Then this line drawn is a key.’ The line is a diagonal across the square one gets the order of the Eng - lish alphabet to be used in the English Qaballa. Whichever diagonal is read the order of the letters is obtained. There is only one order which can be obtained and all 26 letters appear in this order.” Once the Order and value were obtained, it was discovered that a comparison of the numerical value of many mystifying words and phrases were explained in a"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"Secret Rituals of the Men In Black 7 meaningful way by finding words and values in the ‘code book’ itself, The Book of the Law , but also in other sacred texts from the same body of materials, termed “Class A” documents by Crowley. The discovery was made by Jim Lees in 1976, and others including Carol Smith and Jake Stratton-Kent contributed to early experiments with the Cipher. During the 1980s one initiate now known as Soror Ishtaria, an active member and now Outer Head of the QBLH, developed a computer program, Lexicon, which enables the researcher to quickly obtain the value of any word or phrase and compare that value to numerical values in The Book of the Law or, in theory, any text using standard English letters whatsoever. Furthermore, Soror Ishtaria, by examining the cipher as a 26 pointed star (one point for each standard letter), discovered, with mainframe computer assistance, that by varying the “cycle” (the cycle we have dis - cussed here is 11; that is, there are 11 spaces between each letter in order of value), without repeating any letter twice, one could obtain many alternate ciphers, each yielding, like the first, interesting and evidential results. For some years this system remained the exclusive “open secret” of a small circle of occultists. When the present writer encountered the system, I quickly realized that this cipher was discovered in a manuscript said to be dictated by a præterhuman, per - haps Ultraterrestrial intelligence, calling itself “Aiwass”. Did the system, I wondered, shed any light on UFO related contact cases? Indeed it did, and this relationship formed the core of my earlier book, Secret Cipher of the UFOnauts . Contact names such as “Ashtar” and “Aura Rhanes” and “Orthon” were shown in a completely new light. Furthermore, certain cases contained what appeared to be intentionally “cod - ed” or encrypted messages which, when intercepted, predicted future similar cases, or the future course of the same case. But, unavoidably, I also took a look backwards, before The Book of the Law , and discovered that similar ‘coded messages’ were contained in, for example, the names of ‘control entities’ in classical trance mediumship, and in the purported names of Secret Chiefs or Mahatmas in Theosophy and occultism. This meant that the ‘code’ first revealed in a public manner in The Book of the Law did not originate in 1904 with the Book itself. When I began to investigate the secret words and legends in Rosicrucian and Ma - sonic lore, and in occult rituals, I discovered that this code had been in use for some time, and had been preceded by other codes following the same rules for deciphering (otherwise called Qabala, Kaballah or Caballa) used in the Cipher of the New Aeon. The truth became unavoidable: Ultraterrestrials and human Adepts had long been communicating in a code which we were now cracking, and all previous bets about the nature of the history of our planet itself were now on hold."},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"Allen H.

Thus, we find the ‘modern’ Egyptian Masonic Rite of Memphis conferring a secret Degree called ADEPT OF SIRIUS, the name of which, decoded using the eleven-fold cipher encrypted in The Book of the Law , means SECRET CHIEFS and, also, SECRET MASTER. Fortified with the 1904 Cipher, we can take, for example, the case of Trevor James Constable, author (as “Trevor James”) of the seminal 1950s work They Live in the Sky , and an active experimenter today with Reichian Energies. John A. Keel long ago noticed that UFO contact incidents seemed to step out of time in the usual sense. Without the UFOnaut Cipher, however, the predictive aspect of this non-linear factor can be lost. In April, 1965, a piece of parchment was found wrapped around a glass vial con - taining some silver sand. This was the site of Arthur Bryant’s encounter with “Yam - ski” the newly made “ascended master” who emerged from a UFO the day after contactee George Adamski’s death half a world away. The parchment contained the Greek words Adelphos Adelpho (“brother to brother”). Two years later, in December of 1967, student Tom Monteleone encountered a UFO being in Adelphi, Maryland. The name of the town should alert us to a probable ‘coded’ relationship to the earlier case. Monteleone was told by the entity he met that it was named VADIG. Later, he met Vadig in Washington, D.C. (where Adamski had died and was buried) in ‘civil - ian clothes’ several times. On each occasion VADIG, as if for emphasis, closed his conversation with the phrase, “I’ll see you in time.” Keeping in mind that one of Adamski’s main contacts had been Fir-kon, and that this name had been adopted by an Adamski and Williamson follower who disap - peared without a trace, along with his partner ‘Ramu’ we are not surprised to find that VADIG = 51 = RAMU, but also, LODGE. The value again shows up in the recent ZARKON case. As we have seen, the strange words and names that show up in Masonic Lodge settings are similar in form and purpose to those which show up in contact cases. They show up in modern cases of Angelic Visitation, which, in a sense, resemble the visitations of the Men in Black. The Hebrew word for “angel” literally means “messenger” and the names of these messengers are often equivalent to the names of Ultraterrestrial Messengers. They also show up in demonology. The original “etheric” and “astral” contacts took place in the ‘50s, and are a lot like"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"Allen H. Greenfield 10 the Richard Shaver ‘hidden worlds’ material. It is of interest that an old acquaintance from both the lore of classical occultism and the legends of modern Ufology, known as “Ashtar” shows up in these contacts as well. “Ashtar” is, in traditional occult circles, a demon of considerable power. In UFO lore, he is usually a “positive force” or is so identified by percipients. A variant name that shows up in UFO contact cases is ASHTAR SHERAN. Constable also was in communication with one ANDOLO. Interestingly, ASHTAR tells Constable which beings are “etheric” and “good” and which are “astral” and “satanic”. He tells Constable that one of the bad guys, so to speak is ERANUS, who he identifies as Satan himself. These contacts are somewhat puzzling, because they contain, when viewed in light of the Secret Cipher of the UFOnauts, aspects of deception on the part of certain Ultraterrestrial parties, and we note the pattern of even a bizarre humor entering the picture. ASHTAR SHERAN = 108 = FINGERS, while SHERAN by itself = 61 = TOES. ASHTAR = 47 = ATLANS (one of Shaver’s Ancient Races) and AEON. ANDOLO = 37 = AGE. ERANUS, on the other hand, yields 74 = SOLAR DISC and TERRA. ASHTAR (47) also yields DISC. Both ASHTAR (47 or 4+7=11) and ERANUS (74 or 7+4=11; note the 47/74 reversal) both reduce to the ‘code key number,’ eleven. I should emphasize again that a reduction to eleven is usually only possible in significant cases, eleven being the “cycle key” to the UFOnaut cipher, as explained elsewhere. ERANUS = 74 = RIDDLE. It makes an anagram for SUN ERA = 74 = SOLAR DISC! SUN ERA = 74 = SOLAR DISC brings to mind Aleister Crowley’s anthropologi - cal observations on “Satan”. He informs us that “The Devil does not exist. It is a false name invented by the Black Brothers to imply a Unity in their ignorant muddle of dispersions...‘The Devil’ is, historically, the God of any people that one personally dislikes...This ‘Devil’ is called Satan or Shaitan, and regarded with horror by people who are ignorant of his formula, and, imagining themselves to be evil, accuse Nature herself of their own phantasmal crime. Satan is Saturn, Set, Abrasax, Adad, Adonis, Attis, Adam, Adonai, etc. The most serious charge against him is only that he is the Sun in the South. The Ancient Initiates, dwelling as they did in land whose blood was the water of the Nile or the Euphrates, connected the South with life-withering heat, and cursed the quarter when the solar darts were deadliest...But to us, aware of the astronomical facts, this antagonism to the South is a silly superstition which the accidents of their local conditions suggested to our animistic ancestors. ” Ashtar, on the other hand, is more suspect. He is frequently mentioned in the UFO literature. Early contactee George Van Tassel mentions him in 1952 as “Ashtar, commandant of station Schare” and a very powerful ruler. Van Tassel’s Giant Rock conventions became the fountainhead of the entire contemporary New Age move - ment. Van Tassel’s trance channel group, in fact, included advanced students of Parmahansa Yogananda’s Yogic Philosophy. UFOlogist Bryant Reeves told his wife Helen that Van Tassel “reminds me of a veritable modern ‘John the Baptist’ crying in the wilderness, ‘Prepare ye for a new cosmic age’.” The occult literature has always"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"Secret Rituals of the Men In Black 11 considered ASHTAR, or Astaroth, a fallen angel, that is, a malevolent demon. The Lemegeton (the Lesser Key of Solomon, or Book of Evil Spirits) tells us that Ashtar “ discourses willingly on the Fall but pretends that he himself was exempt from their lapse”. This sounds suspiciously like what ASHTAR was doing with Trevor Con - stable, and other contactees, particularly in America. Interestingly also, The True Key of Solomon ( Grimorium Verum , dated 1517 and allegedly translated from an earlier Hebrew source) tells us that ASHTAR migrated to America, presumably around the time of Columbus. So, when ASHTAR SHERAN (= “FINGERS & TOES”) tells us to watch out for the “Satanic” ERANUS (= SUN ERA or SOLAR DISC), watch out for Ashtar. Constable, be it noted, has come to have a more wary view of his early communications experiences, for which he has our admiration. The More Angelic side is represented here too. METATRON, the classical angelic being said to be the ascended Patriarch Enoch and the “original “man in black” who wrestled all night with Jacob in The Book of Genesis and gave him the name “Is - rael” has the valuew of 128 in NAEQ6, that of SPACE SHIP, TWO FOLD NAME (Enoch-Metatron; Jacob-Israel) and NEW AGE KEY. TIME Magazine for Decem - ber 27, 1993 features a cover story on“The New Age of Angels”. It offers a remarkably uncritical account of the New Age Angel Fad, which seems to have replaced dolphins, crystals, unicorns and fairies, all so trendy in the ‘80s. Some of the accounts resemble the encounters with Men in Black in UFO lore or the ‘black man’ of medieval demonology, the major difference, as one expects from the New Age perspective, being that these visitors are taken to be benevolent in nature, In the Summer of 1977 Ann and Gary Cannady were visited at a time of extreme stress in their lives. Ann had been diagnosed as having advanced uterine cancer, and was three days away from major surgery. Gary’s first wife had died of the same disease, and Ann’s diagnosis had been confirmed by repeated tests. The door bell rang, and Gary answered. Standing on the step was a large man, a good inch taller than her 6-ft. 5-in. hus - band. “He was the blackest black I’ve ever seen,”Ann says, “and his eyes were a deep, deep azure blue.” The stranger introduced himself simply as Thomas. And then he told her that her cancer was gone. They invited the mysterious stranger inside, where he reaffirmed that she was healed. Ann asked, point blank, who he was, to which the stranger replied, ‘I am Thomas. I am sent by God.’ He then proceeded to perform a sort of laying-on-of- hands healing. Ann felt a burst of light and heat go through her body, and passed out. Subsequent testing showed no trace of the cancer, and there has been no recurrence. The obsidian angel quoted Isiah 53:5 to the couple, a text concerned with healing through sacrifice. THOMAS = 62 = ORDER and SACRED and AIWASS & LAM in NAEQ6, thus identifying the commonplace name with the current of the present Aeon. But, lest the omen be misunderstood, on the next page TIME gives another modern angelic account, a being seen by Melissa Deal Forth with her dying husband"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"Allen H. Greenfield 12 Chris Deal, comforting him and seemingly communicating to him a profound sense of peace. When her husband was discovered missing from his hospital bed only days before his death, she found him in the hospital chapel “with a man she had never seen before”. He was tall, dressed rather like Chris usually did, in a flannel shirt, new Levis and lace-up workboots that appeared as if they, too, had just been taken off the shelf. The clothing of such visitors in UFO lore also often appear taken ‘directly off the shelf ’. “There was no real age to him,”Melissa says. “No wrinkles. Just this perfectly smooth and pale, white, white skin and icy blue eyes. I mean I’ve never seen that color blue on any human before.” Students of MIB cases will recognize the basic fabric of all the visitation cases here."},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"13 3 T HE M ITCHELL S ISTERS C LASSIFIED Communications is a newsletter put out by Erich A. Aggen, Jr., an “old hand” in UFOlogy. The April, 1994 issue carried some material on the clas - sic UFO contact story of the Mitchell Sisters, who mysteriously disappeared in the early 1960s. Aggen gives us a condensed version of a 1959 speech by Betty and Helen Mitchell: “We were contacted quite unexpectedly while we were shopping in St. Louis. We had gone into a sandwich shop for a coke,” Betty tells us, “when the contact was completed by the Space People.” The two were ELEN and ZELAS, from THE LEAGUE. Later, Helen informs us, “I was alone in downtown St. Louis on business when I was again contacted by the space people and at their request went with them by automobile into Illinois where we drove to a heavily wooded area. There, I was told, was where they landed when they had business or contacts to make in St. Louis.” The 38 foot saucer was parked out back. It had the usual sliding doors and domes. Taken to the mother ship, Helen met Three Men, one of whom was ALNA, a ranking official. Helen also spoke about the Martian city named VRSS, and a contact from Venus named TREGON. These cases, with their mundane “on the street” somewhat humorous aspects (meetings in diners, driving in cars with aliens, etc.) have ALWAYS been a part of the UFO lore, and point up how intermeshed the phenomena are with daily life. Aggen, in the same issue, also discusses a 1964 letter from a mysterious “Mr. N.Y.” concerning aliens from the Planet BAAVI, which orbits Proxima Centauri. In ancient times they constructed a base, now an astonishing ruin, at Baalbek in the Lebanon. In 1964 they were based in the Maldive Islands, using space ships called VAID - ORGES. These cases are another bonanza for the UFO cipher detective. ELEN = 66, a number that has shown up so often we hardly need trot it out again; Aleister Crowley’s Liber LXVI The Ritual of the Bloody Star , Gloria Lee’s 66 day death fast, MA ION (Frater Achad’s post 1948 Fellowship), the amphibious being OANNES = 66, etc. ZELAS = 41 = VALIS (The late visionary author Phil Dick’s name for the celestial “God-computer” Vast Active Living Intelligence System and the title of his last major novel). THE LEAGUE = 134 = FIRKON & RAMU (who, like the Mitchell sisters, mysteriously disappeared). VRSS = 32 = DOOR, suggest - ing it is not so much a city as a portal. TREGON, associated with Venus, = 93, the number of the Current of the Aeon, and equal to O TREE (the female aspect of the Qabalistic Tree of Life, the right pillar base of which is traditionally held to be NETZACH or the Sphere of Venus). VENUS = 71 = JEWEL and IS A STAR. That Venus is perceived as a “jewel-like star” is hardly news, but the cipher value seems too close for coincidence. The “Mr. N.Y.” case has Shaverian overtones, and may be a kind of “safe passage”"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"Allen H. Greenfield 14 code. BAAVI = 55 = DEROS. Not a group one would want to take up with. On the other hand, the craft called VAIDORGES = 100 = ENTER and NOT DEROS. This may be a bit technical, but by the cipher decoding technique known as “Theosophi - cal Addition” - the value of Baavi and the value of Vaidorges both become ten and then one. BAAVI = 55 or 5+5=10, and 1+0=1. VAIDORGES = 100, or 10+0=10 and 1+0=1. Ten is the operable number of the Piscean Age (Ten Commandments, Ten Spheres on the Tree of Life, etc). In the New Aeon (Age of Aquarius), which began in March of 1904 of the common era, this becomes a bit suspect. VAIDORGES as such are NOT DEROS, but the pilots, BAAVI, are DEROS. All of the old machines, as Dick Shaver told us half a century ago, were developed by beings who were NOT DEROS, but Deros, according to the Shaverian mythos, are usually in control of them today. Stay off of the VAIDORGES - they may be a hazard to your health. But who is the ‘Surgeon General’ who built the warning into the names? We have been noticing frequent manifestation of the Number of the New Aeon, eleven. More Elevens: Ray Palmer’s FACT (his way of decoding UFO stories) = 56 or 5 + 6 = 11, the number that is the KEY to the Cipher of the UFOnauts . When RAP said he had a FACT to decode stories, this is what he meant. But who gave him the Cipher of the UFOnauts? The pulp fiction magazines of the 1930s and 40s were where Palmer started, and THAT arena was full of occultists, future UFOlogists, and the like. Major Donald Keyhoe, H.P.Lovecraft and his circle, Col. Arthur Burks, L. Ron Hubbard and many others were involved, until television killed the entire genre in the early 1950s."},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"15 4 N EW A GE OR N EW Æ ON ? T HE term “New Age” was restricted, until the late 1960s, to a relatively narrow group of people, although the New Aeon concept has been present in esoteric circles from the beginning of the Twentieth Century. The popular culture of the 1960s brought the idea into focus for large numbers of people, which have continued to increase. One of the first ventures beyond the immediate confines of the occult movement (which had a hard core of mere hundreds) was in Guy Warren Ballard’s I AM move - ment. The term I AM became, for many years, a kind of “cipher signal” held in com - mon by those ‘in the know’ about the New Age movement. In the 1960s, the term I AM began to be replaced by the metaphysical cipher WE ARE ONE. Both terms can be linked, through New Aeon Qabalistic Cipher, to Frater Achad. FRATER ACHAD = 117 = CLEAR LIGHT. The Value 117 also makes specific refer - ence to the predictions in The Book of the Law , which was dictated at the very dawn of the New Aeon, that C.S. Jones (Frater Achad, or Frater Parzival) would provide the key to decoding the Cipher. FRATER ACHAD = 117 = A FEAST FOR A-L-W (the first three letters of the code); LETTERS; ORDER & VALUE; NEW SYMBOLS and I WHO SHALL SAY “NOT”. The word “NOT” is a major key to the cipher. The other magical name or motto mentioned, FRATER PARZIVAL (the name Jones used as an O.T.O. member and eventual chief ), has a value of 175. FRATER ACHAD = 117 = CLEAR LIGHT. FRATER PARZIVAL = 175 = LIGHT IN ME, suggesting a cipher link, just as the names are linked in the concept behind the Tarot Card “The Fool” which represents the completely blank slate on which the lessons of life are written. To appreciate “I AM” as used here, we must recall the Biblical ac - count of the incident of the Burning Bush. “(Moses) gazed, and there was a bush all aflame, yet the bush was not consumed.” We are informed that this was a messenger of the divine. In this Close Encounter, Moses, asks the name of the god to whom he is speaking. “God said to Moses, “Ehy - eh-Asher-Ehyeh.” He continued, “Thus shall you speak to the Israelites: ‘Ehyeh’ sent me to you.” “This mysterious and numinous phrase has puzzled scholars for genera - tions. The phrase is translated variously as I AM THAT I AM, I AM WHO I AM, I WILL BE WHAT I WILL BE, etc. Whatever it means, and the JPS Hebrew-English translation leaves it untranslated , I AM is the standard translation, and the phrase that became the New Age “cipher key” in Ballard’s movement. It is rumored that Ballard’s son Mark, who virtually disappeared during a period of legal trouble for his father, resurfaced as the famous trance channel Mark Prophet, one of the key players in the modern “New Age” movement. I AM = 45 = NOT. I AM was replaced by the phrase WE ARE ONE = 112 = WHO AND WHAT I AM. It is also the value of Ballard’s student George Hunt"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"Allen H.

Dee directed the ceremonies, observed the proceedings, and carefully wrote down the results. It was in this way that the entire magical system which is called Enochian, originated.” Gerald J. Schueler T HE cipher brought to light (or, in a sense, “hidden in plain sight”) in 1904 by Aiwass, the præterhuman contact associated with Aleister Crowley, was not the first magical cipher or system developed in the English-speaking world. In 1581, Dr. John Dee and Edward Talbott, who took the last name “Kelly” as they began their work together, conducted a long series of Magical Workings which produced intense and detailed communication with Ultraterrestrial Intelligences of a high order. A language, cosmology (scheme of the universe) and a (now lost) set of practical instructions emerged, which foreshadowed the New Aeon Cipher, just as the Enochian ‘language’ echoed earlier Rosicrucian models. Three hundred years later the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, organized by High Grade Freemasons associated with John Yarker and Kenneth Mackenzie and their esoteric approach to the Mysteries, took up the Enochian work as part of their late-Victorian “magical revival”. The English magick of the culturally rich Elizabethan Era was to an extent perfected in the equally fertile Victorian Age. What developed was a reconstituted and perfected version of Dee and Kelly’s partially lost practical system of instruction for contacting Ultraterrestrial Entities, and for ‘astral’ travel (sometimes physical travel) to other celestial spheres (or “planets”) called “Aeth - yrs” or “Aires” of the Universe. When Aleister Crowley, still rather fresh from the dictation of The Book of the Law , took up the exploration of the Enochian Aethyrs in 1909, he did so not far from the home of Max Theon, then himself taking the dictation of The Cosmic Philosophy as - sociated with the Hermetic Brotherhood of Light he had once headed. These unique ethereal communications ended for Theon shortly thereafter with the untimely death of his wife, the gifted trance medium Alma Ware. Crowley worked in these sessions with his disciple Victor Neuburg. Having done some preliminary workings during his active period in the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn in 1900, Crowley produced a truly remarkable document of Communication with Higher Intelligences, that is, Ultraterrestrial Contacts — and Travel to Other Realms. Published as The Vision and the Voice in his famous journal, The Equinox , it ranks as world-class mystical literature with methodical notes on the ceremonial methods used which could be reproduced by any dedicated experimenter — though, it is true, not without some risk."},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"Allen H. Greenfield 20 The implication here should not be underestimated; in fact there is good reason to believe that the 13th Enochian Aethyr, called “ZIM” transports the scryer directly to the Sirius planetary system, where one can meet the Oannes, or NOMMO as the Dogon (“people of the fish god Dagon”) call him, under the name NEMO. This scientific methodology approaching mystical phenomena was in keeping with Crowley’s philosophy of “Scientific Illuminism” — described uniquely as ‘the aim of religion, the method of science’. The “Enochian Universe” consists of Thirty ‘Aethyrs’ or ‘Worlds’ each quite unique and inhabited by quite different entities. Through a Ritual Opening of the Portal of the Adepti and the recitation of certain Enochian “Keys” or “Calls,” any specific Aethyr can be reached, and the contactee can interact with the inhabitants and function within the rarified environment. In 1991-92, the present writer organized and conducted a series of 30 experiments with this very system, one each week over a thirty week period. This was preceded by two instructional Intensives devoted to educating prospective participants on the Enochian System of Contacting the Ultraterrestrials at various levels. I took upon myself the Induction, but deliberately selected a number of relative novices for my ‘seers’ or contactees. In this way any results would be relatively un - tainted by prexisting knowledge of what to ‘expect’. Due precautions were taken, but every one of the twenty or so participants (some of whom came and went as the long and challenging series of workings ran their incredible course) were told that this was, truly, Risky Business. The results were quite spectacular, by anyone’s account. Conducted under the aus - pices of a Major Lodge of one of the Great Magical Orders of Antiquity, in the fashionable Temple located in a historic and elegant building mostly tenanted by a number of holistic health practitioners and environmental groups, every single ama - teur contactee was successfully propelled by us into the targeted ‘Aethyr’ or specific Ultraterrestrial Sphere I invoked, met with and had communication with the Entities or Forces of that realm, and returned. In the process, eerie physical effects were frequently, almost routinely produced. On one occasion, at the critical moment of closure electrical power failed not only in the building but for a block in either direction from the Temple. Casual participants and hardened veterans alike sometimes saw Entities physically appear within the Temple during sessions, although all doors and windows were locked from the inside and monitored by my assistants and myself. Some effects were ‘picked up’ by tenants in the building who were totally unaware of the Ceremonies, and sensitives several miles distant spontaneously and accurately sometimes ‘picked up on’ peak events. Uncannily, a recap at the conclusion of each session revealed a startling degree of correlation with the experiences recorded by Crowley for the same Aethyr in 1909. Although my amateur contactees (“scryers” or “seers”) were not particularly learned regarding such matters (they did not, in fact, even know one another very well for the most part), the parallel was so close at times that I resorted to switching scryers at the"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"Secret Rituals of the Men In Black 21 last minute for a particular session in case someone was ‘boning up’ on a particular Aethyr. It made no difference in the result. Sometimes two contactees “co-scryed” the same Aethyr, interacting with one an - other rather like astronauts on the lunar surface or in space, as well as with the deni - zens of the Aire being traveled to. I had maintained substantial control throughout, acting as a kind of guardian. On one memorable occasion the contactee being in some difficulty, I took a (quite physical) consecrated magical tool (a sword, as it hap - pens), and handed it “up” to the scryer, who was quite able to perceive, grasp and use it to unravel her predicament with it. This was clearly a direct interaction between one plane or dimension of existence and another on an intentional basis. But, unlike in many UFO Abduction episodes, my scryer and I were calling the shots. I realized that what we were utilizing here was something in the way of an ages-old “ritual technology” for producing human-alien contact. The ancient Priestesses of Delphi used such a technique, and the modern RA Material produced by the Ken - tucky-based contactee Lightlines group, centered around Carla Rueckert and the late Don Elkins, had been doing much the same thing when they would take perfectly ordinary people and, applying their own metatechnology, produce communication with the same group of Entities, even though they were careful to isolate one con - tactee from another. I did not, then, “need” a talented medium like Mark Probert or Richard Shaver to produce meaningful results. Nor did I approach these Entities with undue reverence. In fact, assisted by an Ordained Exorcist, I routinely ended each session with a full scale Formal Exorcism. Again, and this is very important, unlike the Adamski-type contacts, the place and time of contact was under our control, not Theirs. (This is aside from the question of whether classical contacts were in some sense ‘guided’ by a “secret magician” — in the case of Adamski, perhaps George Hunt Williamson.) This was human over alien, not the other way around. Dee and Kelly had not been so lucky, back in Elizabethan England. Dr. Dee started out as a distinguished scholar in a world peopled by Bacon, Shakespeare, and the savants who gave us the King James translation of the Bible. Dee’s library was eventu - ally looted by a mob and partially destroyed. Kelly, for his part, contacted the Forces of the Seventh Enochian Aethyr, encoun - tering an entity that sent him running forever from scrying, taking with him the pitiful remnant of Dee’s once-considerable fortune...and Dee’s wife. He disappeared into oblivion. A somewhat similar occurrence ended the famous “Babalon Working” of John W. Parsons and L. Ron Hubbard in the 1940s. Parsons claimed, after opening a Star Gate, that “BABALON is now incarnate on the earth in the form of a mortal woman.” Hubbard went on to develop the influencial Church of Scientology.

This, originally, referred to Sirius, which is similarly depicted in bas reliefs from the ancient Sumerian-Babalonian civilization, and the semi-aquatic nature of the Visitors ‘from’ the Sirius system called “Oannes”. In whatever event, the Lady, spectacularly erotic and “beyond good and evil” (that is, beyond Duality) in a way totally unpalatable even to a rogue like Kelly in the time of Elizabeth I or King James, told him, “...I am Understanding, and science dwelleth in me; and the heavens oppress me. They come and desire me with infinite appetite; for none that are earthly have embraced me, for I am shadowed with the Circle of Stars, and covered with the morning clouds.” Phrases such as “the heavens oppress me” in this instance, or “I come from a coun - try much weaker than your own” in the INDRID COLD close encounter case, are generally made by entities from worlds which have been conquered by the Gray Aliens, unlike the Earth. Kelly ran, in terror and without Understanding. Crowley, scrying the same Aethyr on December 7, 1909 in the Algerian Desert, described her as “...the Daughter of the King. This is the Virgin of Eternity. This is she that the Holy One hath wrestled from the Giant Time, and the prize of them that have overcome Space.” Even Crow - ley could almost not bear the intensity of the contact. All of this closely parallels an episode in the short novel published by Ray Palmer in Amazing Stories in March, 1945. “I Remember Lemuria” launched the late Richard Shaver’s remarkable career as a mystic seer in the totally inappropriate context of a science fiction pulp magazine. Shaver’s protagonist was Mutan Mion, an antediluvian hero of Inner Earth in the last thrashings of any kind of real civilization. Mutan Mion goes to visit the highest ranking NORTAN he can reach, the Nortans being the most ancient of space faring races who live in Deep Space away from the detrimental radiation of all Stars, in a state of virtual endless growth and near immortality. As Mion relates it: “We were drawn as by a powerful magnet toward a huge figure which was an intense concentration of all vitally stimulating qualities that make beauty the sought- for thing that it is . . . “All of eighty feet tall she must have been. She towered over our heads as she arose to greet us, a vast cloud of the glittering hair of the Nor women floating about her head, the sex aura a visible iridescence flashing about her form. “I yearned toward that vast beauty which was not hidden for in Nor it is considered impolite to conceal the body greatly, being an offense against art and friendship, to take beauty out of life . . .” Compare this to Crowley’s Algerian vision of the Being of the 9th Aethyr (Decem - ber 7, 1909): “And this palace is nothing but the body of a woman . . . “It is impossible to say anything about her. She is naked; her whole body is covered with fine gold hairs, that are the electric flames that are the spears of mighty and ter - rible Angels whose breastplates are the scales of her skin. And the hair of her head,"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"Allen H. Greenfield 24 that flows down to her feet, is the very light of God himself.” Crowley is eventually shown into what he calls a ‘tower’by an Ultraterrestrial Being. The ‘chamber’ is “furnished with maps of many mystical cities. There is a table, and a strange lamp, that gives light by jetting four columns of vortex rings of luminous smoke.” The ‘tower’ is some kind of spire or turret, the ‘chamber’ some kind of alcove or containment. The description given is, however, bizarrely similar to that given by modern contactees of the interior of so-called ‘space ships’. Crowley’s perception seems, on balance, far closer to the actual nature of the ‘place’. This seems all the more plausible when we take cognizance of Crowley’s vision, six days earlier in the same location, in the 15th Aethyr: “And behold! there is one God therein, and the letters of the stars in his crown, Orion, and the Pleiades, and Aldebaran, and Alpha Centauri, and Cor Leonis, and Cor Scorpionis, and Spica, and the pole-star, and Hercules, and Regulus, and Aquila, and the Ram’s Eye. “And upon a map of stars shalt thou draw the sigil of that name; and because also some of the letters are alike, thou shalt know that the stars also have tribes and na - tions...” It should be well noted that the 15th through the 1st Aethyr of the Enochian System are linked, according to Crowley’s experiences, by the being Nemo. The English language based Cipher of the UFOnauts is less helpful here than usual. This seems to be the realm of Enochian and earlier Hebrew-based ciphers. But, none - theless, keeping in mind the cipher qabalistic principles are the same in all contexts , and with a nod to Shaver’s MANTONG concept (English is a bastardized reinvention of the primal language of the Universe, called “Mantong”), we note that the Aethyr’s Name, DEO, has a NAEQ6 cipher value of 38, the same as that of AIWASS, the in - telligence which dictated The Book of the Law to Crowley. If Shaver’s “Princess Vanue of Nor” is the Being of DEO, the great nude female entity with a sexual aura nearly unbearable even to the preeminent Sexual Magus of the Twentieth Century, Aleister Crowley, we may find her title CHIEF OF THE NOR ON QUANTO revealing, as its cipher 6 value of 297 is that of TEMPLE WHORE PRINCESS."},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"Secret Rituals of the Men In Black 25 Frontispiece to “ AHIMAN REZON ,” 1764."},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"Allen H.

A great deal is written - though mostly in obscure sources concerning the legend - ary founding of an Ultraterrestrial beach head on the Earth in early Sumerian times by the fish-like (and man like) being from Sirius, the Oannes.

Whether such contact is for good or ill depends upon who you read. The proMa - sonic writers tend to consider this a golden secret carried forward by the Knights Templar, founded by Hugh de Paynes and eight other French crusaders in 1118. After enjoying prosperity and the patronage of Catholic Europe for some time, the Order was brutally suppressed by Church and State, but survived, according to Ma - sonic legend, in Scottish Rite Freemasonry after the burning of the last Grand Master Iacobus Burgundus Molanus (I.B.M.) and many of his followers outside of Scotland. The Templars were charged with the secret worship of a half human, half beast called “Baphomet” which some spiritual descendants embrace, while other deny vehement - ly.

Some of the properties - and members - of the Templar Order were taken over by the rival Order of the Knights Hospitaller, otherwise known as the Knights of Rhodes, after their conquest, in 1308 under Fulke de Villaret, of the Island of Rhodes from the Moslems. They are known more familiarly, and in a somewhat sinister con - text, as the Knights of Malta, to which island they retreated after the Moslems retook Rhodes.

Many of these groups, but particu - larly the Knights of Malta, are involved in privately “selling” cooperation between Ultraterrestrial Forces of dubious motivations and Terrestrial governments and in - dustrial groups. In February of 1937, on the eve of the Second World War, a representative of the Knights of Malta, an American (still living as I write this in 1994), met with the more esoteric leadership of the Third Reich in Germany. The meeting took place in a hidden SS retreat, and was attended by General Karl Haushofer, the senior initi - ate of the Black Lodge inside the German Reich. The purpose of the meeting was to “sell” the Nazi regime on contact with what the young Maltese Knight called “the coming race”. Asked by the present writer in 1979 what he meant by the term, he told me “the Ultraterrestrials, of course. The Germans had noted their ‘ghost rockets’ in Sweden, and were aware of their power. Most of the older Nazis present, though, were former members of the Thule Group or the archaic Vril Society, and took me to be talking about Tibetans or Aryan supermen or some such bunk. Except Haushofer, who knew better, and the ‘Man with the Green Gloves’ who, though supposedly a Tibetan himself, was certainly an Ultraterrestrial.” The deal fell through when the Reich fell, and the Knights switched their attention elsewhere. In the early 1950s U.S. President Eisenhower unknowingly bought into a similar plan proposed by the Knights of Malta to him on behalf of their Ultraterrestrial overlords, in the name of the anticommunist crusade of that period. “Deviants” were rounded up, and unprecedented power was placed in the hands of the Military In - dustrial infrastructure throughout the decade, until Eisenhower, in a surprise farewell address, asserted his fundamental decency and libertarian patriotism and roundly denounced the whole deal, paving the way for the Kennedy era and a generation of progressive experimentation. The Knights of Malta briefly found themselves sudden outsiders. A bloody world- wide orgy of assassinations and murders of progressive political and moral leaders quickly followed, and by the 1980s the U.S Administration was safely in the hands of an aged ex-actor with degenerative Alzheimer’s Disease surrounded by a staff nearly totally dominated by members of the Knights of Malta. By the 1990s the anticom - munist pretense could be dropped, the confused and restless citizenry disarmed, and the feeble opposition which remained could be easily coopted. But what of the occult societies that had carried the flame for centuries? What of the UFOlogy, conspiracy theory, metaphysical, and ‘White Lodge’ Masonic groups? The Knights of Malta’s viewpoint infiltrated organized occultism and UFOlogy through the connection between William Dudley Pelley’s pro-Nazi Silver Shirts prior to World War Two, and the occult Black Lodge within the Third Reich, centered in the SS, the Ahnenerbe Society, and the appropriately named “Black Order” -de - scended from such black magical bodies as the Thule Group and the Vril Society as"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"Secret Rituals of the Men In Black 29 detailed in Secret Cipher of the UFOnauts . Pelley and his outfit were certainly tools for the Maltese Knights, and key figures in UFOlogy became involved, including George Adamski and George Hunt Williamson. Adamski was introduced to Wil - liamson by Pelley, at a time when Adamski was trying to sell his contact story as sci - ence fiction to Ray Palmer, then a prominent publisher. These initiates, not including the well-meaning Adamski, were knowledgeable about the Ultraterrestrial cipher, the Sirius-Oannes legend, etc. Interestingly, they were met with a spirited libertarian resistance from the very start by Meade Layne of Borderland Sciences, and his im - mediate successor, the late Riley Crabb, who ‘blew the whistle’ on the interaction between the U.S. Government, the Knights of Malta and Ultraterrestrials since at least 1954. Layne was a True Adept, himself knowing the Ultraterrestrial Cipher and using it to make contacts of his own. Bill Webb of QBLH, an occult body that has done a great deal to reveal the Cipher to a broader public, recalled to us how Layne would visit him in Arizona in the 1950s, on his way to purported UFO landing sites. Webb, like Layne, had been a member of Dion Fortune’s Inner Light offshoot of the Golden Dawn. The classic way of using the Cipher was to read published reports of alien encounters, such as those of Dan Fry, Truman Bethurum and Orfeo Angelucci, convert the planetary and personal names given by Ultraterrestrials to contactees to cipher, and infer where the next landing was going to occur. This seems to have been the HIDDEN PURPOSE of those high profile cases; to get publicized, so that scattered adepts in possession of the cipher would know where and when to make contact. Ironically, Layne was so advanced that his sincere but less initiated successor Crabb was afraid of him, and would actually do ritual exorcisms of the BSRF office on Ad - ams Avenue in San Diego after Layne’s departure, according to what I have been told by BSRF’s present leader, former Michael Bertiaux student Tom Brown. In the meantime, after 1952 the CIA actively sought to infiltrate and disrupt private UFO groups. I was told by Major Dewey Fornet, the one-time Pentagon Monitor for the Air Force UFO Project, that the UFO wave in the Summer of 1952 during the exceptionally hot ‘dog days’ of July, completely overwhelmed the U.S. De - fense system of those relatively technologically unsophisticated times. While UFOs were‘ dog’ fighting with jets and being spotted on radar in restricted air space over the White House and Pentagon, communication channels were so jammed that a ‘sneak attack’ by a more terrestrial enemy (i.e., the Soviet Union) would have gotten through virtually unopposed in the UFO generated confusion. After that, the CIA determined to discredit the whole subject in earnest. A major attempt to set up a ci - vilian National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena was quickly coopted by the intelligence community, and many of the group’s leaders were military and intelligence personnel, including Director Major Donald Keyhoe’s classmate from the Naval Academy and one-time CIA Director, Roscoe Hillenkoetter. Most of the ‘official sounding’ UFO groups of that period are now dead. Curiously, the survivors include the very independent S.A.U.C.E.R.S. of Jim Moseley, and the now fifty year old BSRF.

Whatever they fear in us seems to be our only salvation. Perhaps the early Gnostics had it right in turning the Genesis story on its head. In the Gnostic Version, as in the ancient Hypostasis of the Archons (“the reality of the rulers”) we find that the Serpent of Wisdom is the defender of humanity (in Hebrew Cipher “serpent” and “messiah” have the same numerical value), offering us the Tree of Wisdom and the Tree of Immortality, in opposition to The Authorities, or Celestial Rulers, who wish to keep us in ignorance and in the shadow of death.

But, as the Yada di’ Shi’ite, Aiwass, G.I. Gurdjieff, Phil Dick or Frederich Nietsche would tell us, we are our own salvation or damnation. This is the last thing government bureaucrats, Knights of Malta or goose-stepping Silver Shirts and fundamentalists would have you realize: You are not helpless. Resistance is not futile.

The immediate past source for such rituals are the medieval magical texts termed “ grimoires ” or “grammars” that is, basic instructional texts—but their sources are much older. A clue to the origin of such texts can be found, for example, in the introductory narrative of the Clavicula Salomonis , or Key of King Solomon . In the 1888 translation by S.L. Mathers, we are told by `Solomon’ the purported author, “I suddenly beheld, at the end of a thickly-shaded vista of trees, a Light in the form of a blazing Star, which said unto me with a voice of thunder: Solomon, Solomon, be not dismayed; the Lord is willing to satisfy thy desire by giving thee knowledge of whatsoever thing is most pleasant to thee.” What follows Solomon’s request for wisdom are various techniques for conjuring Celestial Powers and Beings, of controlling their energies and of sending them back to their places of origin. These beings are named and described in detail, as are the planets and spheres of their origin. While the antiquity of some of this material is unknown, some of it shows a knowledge of ancient Gnostic Wisdom Literature un - available in medieval Europe, suggesting a very ancient origin. One ritual that invokes the Power of Contact that comes from the Stars is certainly of very ancient origin. The Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn polished the ritual as “The Bornless Ritual for the Invocation of the Higher Genius” in the late 19th Century, but a cruder version had been published in 1852 under the unappetizing title “ Fragment of a Greco-Egyptian Work Upon Magic ” and later reprinted by the great Egyptologist E. A. Wallis Budge in his turn-of-the-century book Egyptian Magic . 1 In more recent times we have learned a great deal more about the Egyptian magical 1. Charles Wycliffe Goodwin’s translation of the ancient papyrus was published in 1852 as “ Frag - ment of Greco-Egyptian Work Upon Magic .” Wallis-Budge reprinted it at the turn of the twentieth century in Egyptian Magic , and the Golden Dawn began using it as the “Bornless One” ritual shortly before. The Greek original was recently reprinted in the outstanding definitive edition of Book Four edited by Hymenaeus Beta. Crowley certainly worked on the ritual for a number of years, terming it “...the most helpful and exalted of all magical instructions” in his autobiogra - phy. Crowley approached the matter imperfectly (his own assessment) in The Equinox Volume I Number VIII. His perfected version, Liber Samekh, Theurgia Goetia Summa (Congressus Cum Daemone) Sub Figura DCCC was presented to one of his key students at the Abbey of Thelema in 1921. It remains an instructional document of the A. A. to the present day, and, as such, may rest safely upon its stand-alone great merit."},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"Allen H. Greenfield 34 literature of the period following the conquest by Alexander the Great. Alexander, let us remember, was heir not only to the thousands of years of Egyptian occultism, but the similar traditions in Babylon and India, which nations he also conquered. This ritual dates, therefore, at least to the last days of Egypt, but probably reflects an ancestry thousands of years earlier in Egypt, Sumer and India. Popularly known as “The Bornless One” ritual, the title has been variously trans - lated. The literal meaning is something like “The Headless One” but probably carries more the sense of either “the One Without Beginning” (“head” in the languages of this region often means beginning) or possibly “the one without a human head”. The basic ritual, as translated (or interpreted) in The Golden Dawn, is intriguing enough in and of itself. After some ritual preliminaries, the Celebrant (a Zelator Adeptus Minor), aspiring to the ‘higher Genius’ says, facing East: Thee I invoke the Bornless One. Thee that didst create the Earth and the Heavens. Thee that didst create the Night and the Day. Thee that didst create the Darkness and the Light. Thou art Osorronophris, whom no man hath seen at any time. Thou art Iabas. Thou art Iapos. Thou hast distinguished between the Just and the Unjust. Thou dist make the female and the male. Thou didst produce the Seed and the fruit. Thou didst form men to love one another and to hate one another. I am [name and grade] of the Order of the R.R. et A.C., thy Prophet unto whom Thou didst commit Thy Mysteries, the ceremonies of the Magic of Light. Thou didst produce the moist and the dry and that which nour-isheth all created things. Hear me Thou. For I am the Angel of Paphro Osoronophris. This is Thy true Name, handed down to the Prophets of the Sun. What follows are ceremonial vibration of what are called “barbarous names” -- largely meaningless words not unlike the “funny names” associated with contact - eeism, mediumship and the lore of the Secret Chiefs. Our interest is immediately aroused. Though “The Bornless One” (or “The One Without Human Head”) is an old ritual, with words far older than the English, as we have established, the Cipher Rules of Qabalistic analysis were in use with earlier codes used by Ultraterrestrials and Human Adepts long before the rise of modern English speaking cultures. But there is more. Aleister Crowley rewrote the ritual again in the early 1920s, under the name “ Liber Samekh ”, apparently primarily to ‘correct’ the strange non - sense words “with the significance of the BARBAROUS NAMES Etymologically or Qabalistically determined and paraphrased in English”. Since this was the period just after Frater Achad’s Book 31 , the “key” to The Book of the Law , and following Crowley’s main contacts with high-level Ultraterrestrial Chiefs including Aiwaz or Aiwass, Lam, Amalantrah and Abuldiz, such alterations might be expected to restore the old ritual to something of its Ultraterrestrial origin, and so it does. 2 When the UFOnaut Cipher is applied to all of the “barbarous names” as Crowley 2. “The research community has consistently failed to address the real issues posed by flying sau - cers, which relate not to propulsionsystems, aerodynamics and the like, but to the human psyche andthe magical currents that inform it.” —Alec Hidell in Chronicles of the Grey Lodge"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"Secret Rituals of the Men In Black 35 revised them in 1921, all but one of them produces the same values as the names giv - en in modern Ultraterrestrial contactee cases, occult Secret Chiefs, starry wisdom, or Crowley’s own contacts with higher beings, in some readily obvious combination. The entire argument for the Aleister Crowley (Thelemic) Canon is based upon contact with discarnate intelligences of unknown provenance. Crowley himself is quite clear upon this matter in a postscript of a letter to a student written in the mid-1940s, published in Magick Without Tears as “Do You Believe In God?” Yet, some of the Crowlean establishment exhibits remarkable resis - tance to any attempts to link Crowley’s communications to the whole modern literature of trance channeling and contactism. This is true of the obviously related RA and Seth materials, as well as the more outré experiences of Rex and Ray Stanford or the late George HuntWilliamson. This tendency reflects nothing so much as “... a priori fallacies full of ignoratio elenchi, non distributio medii, non sequitur , and sometimes sheer Hobson Jobson,” as Aleister Crowley put it himself. To those few of us trained in both occultism and UFO lore over many years, the parallels are remarkable. If nothing else, we deal here with similarly constituted mythologies. While I have no doubt that there is a most special quality in The Book of the Law , it diminishes it not at all to note that its advent was under similar circumstances to the dictation of OAHSPE a few years earlier, The Cosmic Philosophy of Max Theon contemperaneously, and the RA Material in more recent years. Quite the contrary, in fact. The notion that such association somehow diminishes the “respect” the occult is accorded in the public mind betrays a true disconnection with general con - victions; far more people in industrialized countries are apt to credit the UFO phenomenon than occultism, as major pollsters have noted for many years. The Yankelovich Partners conducted a survey on behalf of LIFE Magazine January 12-13, 2000. They found that 30% of Americans believe extraterrestrials have visited the Earth. 1% claimed alien contact, and 6% claimed to know someone in contact with aliens! 6% claimed to have seen UFOs. 43% thought UFOs were real (a plurality--42% did not think so). THESE ARE STARTLING NUMBERS FROM A MYTHIC STANDPOINT, IF NOTHING ELSE. IT AMOUNTS TO SAYING THAT NEARLY 3 MILLION AMERICANS CLAIMED UFO BEING CONTACT AT THE BEGINNING OF THE 21ST CENTURY! The most recent scientific panel on UFOs, in fact, convened by the Society for Scientific Exploration in 1997, concluded that “there may be more to UFO evidence than just verbal reports of what people see in the sky. Some UFO evidence may be worthy of scientific investigation.” The international panel was co-chaired by Prof. Von Eshleman of Stanford University and Dr. Thomas Holzer of the High Altitude Observatory, and included Stanford’s Prof. Peter Sturrock, Prof. H.J.Melosh of the University of Arizona, Prof. James Papike of the University of New Mexico, Dr. Guenther Reitz of Cologne, Dr. Bernard Veyret of the University of Bordeaux, and Prof. Charles Tolbert of the University of Virginia. The subject is not taken lightly, nor should it be. One should examine the relation, for example, between the image of the mysterious being called “Aiwass” as seen by Crowley in 1904 (“He seemed to be a tall, dark man in his thirties, well-knit, active and strong, with the face of a savage king, and eyes veiled lest their gaze should destroy what they saw.”) and Malcolm X’s 1949 vision of the also mysterious Wallace Fard. (“He wasn’t black, and he wasn’t white. He was light-brown-skinned, an Asiatic cast of countenance, and he had oily black hair.”) Or that Crowley’s rather well-known sketch of the being Lam resembles anticipates, in fact - the large headed beings described in many more recent UFO Abduction Cases. This does not deni - grate Crowley’s work, but it does place it in the context of the mythos ofour times, which, to my mind, enhances its plausibility. To this I must add the foot note, meaning no personal disrespect to any parties who might identify themselves with this critique, that Ipersonally know a number of highly placed, com - petent and erudite champions of magick and mysticism who are almost entirely uninformed on the subjects of UFOlogy and Forteana, and the lore of spiritualism, trance channeling and the contactee subculture that has developed over the last hundred years. The author of this volume has spent some thirty five years studying these phenomena, both interms of the literature and in extensive field research efforts. I have spent nearly as long a time in the study of magick, mysticism and parapsychology. My challenge to those skeptical of the linkage between these fields on either side of the question is to cross reference with some diligence before dismissing what, for some of us, is obviously a part of one continuum."},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"Allen H. Greenfield 36 For example, in the core ritual given above, the phrases, “Thou art Osorronophris, whom no man hath seen at any time. Thou art Iabas. Thou art Iapos.” becomes, in Crowley’s version, “Thou art ASAR UN-NEFER (“Myself made Perfect”): Whom no man has seen at any time. Thou art IA-BESZ (“the truth of the matter”). Thou art IA-APOPHRASZ (“the Truth in Motion”).” These yield the values in NAEQ6 of 144, or STAR KNOWLEDGE, 82 or A LEAGUE, and 114, or THE NAME, a standard Hebrew euphemism for the unutterable four-fold name of Deity. ( It also has the same value as our “old friend” from the Mark Probert channelings, MAHA - RAJA NATCHA.) Keeping in mind that the latter, which I once termed “the silliest of the silly names” refers to one of Sixteen Transtemporal Ascended Human Adepts who form A LEAGUE called the Guardians of Humanity outside of Time and Space in the contacts of Probert some decades after Crowley’s revisions, and that Probert worked with Meade Layne, a one-time adept of a rival body to Crowley’s A. A., descended from the Golden Dawn, we read this as “Thou art STAR KNOWLEDGE, whom no man hath seen at any time. Thou art of A LEAGUE. Thou art THE NAME. Thou art PROTECTOR OF EARTH.” (“Maharaja Natcha” may also be decoded as the less humorous “ of the Sixteen Protectors of Earth ” because of the double name’s cipher values 114 = THE NAME). The intriguing phrase, “Hear me Thou. For I am the Angel of Paphro Oso - ronophris. This is Thy true Name, handed down to the Prophets of the Sun.” in the Golden Dawn version becomes, for Crowley, “Hear Thou Me, for I am the Angel of PTAH-APOPHRASZ-RA: this is Thy True Name, handed down to the Prophets of KHEM.” Now PTAH-APO-PHRASZ-RA has the value 158, or that of Crowley’s own major Ultraterrestrial contacts AMALANTRAH & ABULDIZ, but why does he switch the phrase “Prophets of the Sun” -- a phrase consistent with Crowley’s own philosophy, for “Prophets of KHEM” with the capitalization in the original? Khem is an early name for Egypt, but its value in the UFOnaut cipher is 59, that of BRAHMA. If we recall that, in the Hindu mythos, the sky god Brahma rides a ‘swan’ which makes the sound “Aum”, both the change in “The Bornless One” ritual, and Crowley’s mysteri - ous advice on keeping a personal magical book quoted at the beginning of this sec - tion begin to make sense. He said, “Let the pen with which the writing is done be the feather of a young male swan - that swan whose name is Aum. And let the ink be made of the gall of a fish, the fish Oannes.” The name of that book is given as “The - lema,” or “Will”. All of this tells us that Crowley certainly was privy to the legend of the “fish god” of Sirius, Oannes, the originator of writing, flying from the heavens in a bird-like vehicle making a stange humming sound. Some of the more interesting “barbarous words” offered by Crowley: A-THELE- BER-SET = 192 = ADEPT OF SIRIUS; THIAF = 70 = SPACE; KOTHA = 45 = I AM; DIATHARNA [THORON] = 86 = BEWARE [ORTHON = 68]. “Thoron” is an anagram; it could be made out as “Jesus beware” as well, but, also,"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"Secret Rituals of the Men In Black 37 the mantram for calling UFOs only recently received by a modern contactee, SOLIM SOLARA.

We can nevertheless become quite impressed with its depth, especially as it shows up ONLY in connection with Crowley’s version with the words “corrected”. SOTHIS FISH MAN, or fish-being of Sirius is one cipher meaning of DIATHARNA THORON, as is the related FISH MAN JESUS (recall - ing the original association between Jesus, John and immersion in water).

The sunrise sum - moned her. She lay prostrate before the deity. The shadows of the towering Colossi lay prostrate too. The little humans, with their worshiping and conquered hearts, lay deep within them.” Algernon Blackwood, A Descent into Egypt T HE Priesthoods of ancient Babylon and of Egypt had a fascination with the stars, the Sun and Moon, and the cycles of the sky that is linked directly to their mythologies. Explanations dismissing all such interests as concerns with agricultural cycles tend to pale with recent discoveries. For example, in discussing Judaic-Essene time considerations at the time of Jesus, Dr. Barbara Thiering of the University of Sydney observes, “Terms with an apparent vague meaning are, in fact, precise indi - cators of time...The very close study of the chronology shows that there are terms indicating not only years, seasons, months and days, but hours and even minutes... The members of the community were, in fact, astronomers, spending much of their exile in close study of accurate ways of measuring time.” Why the need for such precision? Babylonian monuments frequently depict local monarchs conversing with beings that are fish-like and humanoid all at once, with the image of the Star Sirius hover - ing overhead. The constellation Canus Major, the “Great Dog”, the principal star of which is the ‘dog star’ Sirius was, for the Egyptians, the most important constellation in the sky, upon which they oriented their Temples. These ancient structures were designed to catch the light of Sirius so that it would shine upon the altar at the star’s rising and setting. The gods and teachers of old, ancient even to the ancients, were said to be semi-aquatic beings from the heavens, the precursors of civilization and the originators of writing, technology and, indeed, of their very social order. Much has been written (but, perhaps, not enough) about the unusual devotion of the ancients to the Star Sirius, and there are vestiges in North African mythology of a knowledge of the binary nature of the Sirius system which should not have been known before very recent times, if conventional history is correct. The ciphers and rituals given by the Ultraterrestrial Visitors to early initiates have been modified and blurred with time, but a remarkable amount of continuous, intact tradition has survived in the world of alchemy, occultism and freemasonic ritual. The Enochian system of magick is an obvious example of a linguistic and ritual survival.

Kenneth Mackenzie’s 1877 catalogue of “the latest form” of the Rite of Memphis lists the 63° as “Adept of Sirius” but by the time of the distinguished Grand Master John Yarker’s last revision of the Rite, AD - EPT OF SIRIUS had been mysteriously omitted in favor of SUBLIME KAWI (63°). In the Secret Cipher of the UFOnauts , SUBLIME KAWI has the same cipher value (149) as the more elaborate degree which immediately follows it, the 63rd, or SAGE OF MYTHRAS. The Word of the SUBLIME KAWI degree, interestingly, is “Krish - na” — the name of a blue-skinned sky god who, according to the Hindu religious tradition, incarnated in a teaching role upon Earth. The 35th Degree, or “Knight of the Temple” is a correlative of the ADEPT OF SIRIUS Degree. Its secret Password is, in fact, “Sirius” or “Dog Star” answered by “Sothis” another name for Sirius. But, what does the substitution mean? Does the ADEPT OF SIRIUS Degree con - tain a clue to the great arcane tradition of the connection between Adepts and Ul - traterrestrials? In the New Aeon Cipher, we discover that ADEPT OF SIRIUS carries the sig - nificant cipher value of 192. Scanning our personal cipher directory, The Book of the Law and other New Aeon Holy Texts, we find that 192 = FOR THE STARS AND TWO. Sirius is a double star, the smaller white dwarf twin invisible to the ancients but known to the Bambera, Dogon, Bozo, Bandiagara and perhaps other North Afri - can tribal peoples even today. At least some of these peoples are of Libyan Garaman - tes, or Greco-Berber descent, and thus connected to ancient Greek, Egyptian and Babylonian tradition. The number 192, “ADEPT OF SIRIUS,” also yields BLUE AM I AND AN EGG (Sirius is the most prominent blue-white star, and said to have dispatched teachers to the Earth in luminous egg shaped craft), THE SCHEDULE FOR ALL, as Sirius was indeed a ‘calendar star’ for the ancient Egyptians, its heli - cal rising being a major concern of Egyptian priest-astronomers, marking the ‘Dog Days’ (July 3-August 11) the year’s hottest period. The Word “Sirius” itself equals 85 or THE DOOR. ADEPT OF SIRIUS also carries the same value as SECRET MASTER, SECRET CHIEFS and NAME THE VOICE. Curiously, in the Lexicon computer search program selected so as to show numbers from the text of Liber AL, ADEPT OF SIRIUS = 192 = THIS WHOSE SIGIL IS 69.

Cancer is still astrologically the Sun Sign associated with the period June 22-July 22. In Aleister Crowley’s incomparable table of correspondences, 777 , The Sign Cancer is associated directly with Sothis (that is, Sirius) the Crab and Water (keeping in mind the amphibious nature attributed to these primeval visitors), but also the Sphinx and the word ABRAHADABRA as a magical formula, in this case the eleven-fold key to the Secret Cipher of the UFOnauts. Sirius is, according to some unorthodox adepts, the Silver Star which informs the Great White Brotherhood directly. The Tarot Card known as “The Star” — and sometimes as “The Dog Star” depicts a nude female fig - ure with one foot on land and the other upon water, pouring a jug of water into the water and another upon the land. In the background are the Tree of Life and the Tree of Knowledge, associated in ancient legend with the Serpent of Wisdom. Overhead is the ‘Dog Star’ Sirius and seven smaller stars, thought to represent the traditional planets or the “Big Dipper” in The Great Bear, but, just as likely, the Pleiades. The amphibious Oannes from Sirius was said, like the Serpent of Wisdom (also alluded to in the venerable card) to have brought Knowledge to humanity. We are informed by an old Masonic text that “The Masons hold their grand festival on the day of St. John, not knowing that therein they merely signify the fish-god Oannes, the first Hermes, and the first founder of the Mysteries...” (The name “Oannes” relates directly to the modern name “John” - see below.) The nude woman is probably a reference to the naked splendor of Nuit, the sky Goddess of the early Egyptians. The Trees refer to a reptilian source of knowledge, the feet and water interchanged referring to the Ultraterrestrials’ alleged amphibious nature. While as divinatory cards the Tarot is old but not ancient, the symbolism closely parallels bas reliefs from ancient Babylon and Sumer, including the peculiar depiction of Sirius itself, as the central star in the sky from the perspective of the card. It is strange that the Degree substituted by the late venerable Grand Master, John Yarker, in the Egyptian System of initiation, SUBLIME KAWI, has a value of 149 in NAEQ6, the numerical exact equivalent of AIWASS’ law of the New Aeon, DO WHAT THOU WILT. KAWI itself has a value of 36, the same as the variant spelling of AIWAZ originally favored by Crowley. The SAGE OF MYTHRAS Degree has the same value, and includes this curious dialogue between the Ceremonial Guard and the candidate for admission to that Degree:"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"Allen H. Greenfield 50 GUARD : Thou seeist a griffin pushing a wheel before it. What does this emblem signify? CANDIDATE: I consider the Griffin to be an emblem of the Sun; and that the wheel which is parted by four spokes, represents the 4 seasons. GUARD: And this Cross called the Diagramma? CANDIDATE: It is formed of four (Greek letter) Gammas, joined at their points, and represents the apparent revolution of the Sun. GUARD: And this figure holding forth the left hand? CANDIDATE: It represents good-faith. GUARD: And this semi-nude figure, with head thrown to the right? CANDIDATE : The sun is never entirely covered at the same time to all the world. GUARD: Why is the hair shorn off, even to the roots? CANDIDATE: It points out this inextinguishable star has the faculty of rebirth. This dialogue, which also refers to an urn, strongly suggests the imagery found in the Tarot Card, “The Star” (card #17) and likely confuses our Sun (Sol, card #19) with the Star Sirius. In the instructions for this degree, a sun and myrtle tree form the background arrangement, and the number seven is a repeated motif, as with the seven stars, also shown in the Tarot Trump. All of this strongly suggests that the Knowledge of the Secret was, indeed, in - tentionally hidden in the symbolism and structure of ‘High Degree Freemasonry’ including the Egyptian Rite of Memphis and Misraim, as Grand Master Michael Bertiaux has suggested. “That rather lifeless system, which contained some rather interesting Egyptian roots,” Bertiaux wrote, “was really quite remarkable. It was the design for the computer and energy system of what we might now be tempted to call something like a UFO object or projection from some empirical or chaotic [occult power zone]; but, which at that time, as strange as it might seem to the uninformed reader of these matters, was posing rather inconspicuously as an Egyptian Rite of Ancient Freemasonry with the name of ‘Memphis-Misraim’”.

Such Ciphers generally follow the ‘decoding’ rules found for many centuries in the Qabalistic System, and seem to be designed for simple communication between initiates, on the one hand, but to also serve the more occult purpose of allowing “deep agents” of Ultraterrestrial penetration into Earthly civilization to call attention to themselves through the use of key phrases in wellpublicised encounters. In Secret Cipher of the UFOnauts , I disclosed how the ancient Qabala of Nine Chambers had been employed to develop the English-language Cipher communi - cated to Royal Arch Masons in the York Rite down to modern times. Looking again into the Ark, the High Priest takes out four pieces of paper, which he examines closely, consults with the King and Scribe, and then puts together, so as to show a KEY to the ineffable characters of this Degree...The key to the ineffable characters, or Royal Arch Cipher...consists of right angles, in various situations, with the addi - tion of a dot. By transposition, it forms twenty six distinct characters, correspond - ing with the twenty six letters of the English Alphabet. That this is built on a structure based on a Qabalistic code formed out of the 22 letters of the Hebrew Alphabet is both extremely clever and indicative of a very long history. The pattern is repeated with other Ciphers in the Masonic System. In the 34th Degree of the Rite of Memphis, The newly made “Knight of Scandi - navia” is given a “Runic” cipher. As we show elsewhere in this volume, this Degree is itself built around the Secret Cipher of the UFOnauts, and is an allegory for the Visitation of Ultraterrestrial teachers from Sirius in ancient times. Another Cipher is given in the 64°, “Sage of Mythras” one of the oldest and most elaborate of Masonic Degrees. This cipher is similar to the Royal Arch Cipher, and is called the “Ammanian Alphabet”. This Degree not only refers to the origins of the Mysteries in the Ultrater - restrial interventions here, but it contains internal evidence that the ritual itself may be of Ultraterrestrial origin! Part of the ritual is conducted in the blue-white light of Sirius, and the “setting” is as in the Tarot Card “The Star” which, as we demonstrate elsewhere, is not our Sun, but a world beneath the Sun-star Sirius. In the Memphis System, there are also ciphers for the 75th Degree and the 90th Degree. The latter alludes to an ancient War between Ultraterrestrial forces for con - trol of the Earth. The cipher is much like that which generated the rituals of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn in the last century."},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"Allen H.

In one version, the founder of Freemasonry is said to be the Hebrew Patriarch Enoch, who “walked with God” and did not taste of death. Enoch is often associated with the Great Divine Being Metatron, and, in Elizabethan Occultism, the system of Magick and the occult cipher which bears his name. The legend of Enoch closely par - allels the story of the later Hebrew prophet Elijah, who was said to have been taken alive into the Heavens in a Fiery Chariot. He is also associated with the Babylonian astrologer Heabani, also said to have been taken alive into the skies by the god Hea. This legend is paralleled by another associated with a mysterious being called “Oannes”. The historian Berosus, and later Alexander Polyhistor, described Oannes, or John as a sentient amphibious creature which emerged from the Persian Gulf in ancient Sumer in the daytime to teach the arts and sciences to humanity. At sunset, he returned to the waters of the Gulf. One may find associations with various versions of the Jonah legend, that of the fish-god Dagon, etc. Sumer appeared ‘out of nowhere’ about 5500 years ago in southern Mesopotamia. No trace of their culture or unique language have been found elsewhere. They disappeared about 4000 years ago, having left a profound impact on Babylonia and other civilizations in economics, the art of writing, mathematics, astronomy, legal practices and architectural forms, as well as religion. As noted above, one early Masonic history has it that “The Masons hold their grand festival on the day of St. John, not knowing that therein they merely signify the fish-god Oannes, the first Hermes, and the first founder of the Mysteries...” At the time the orthodox Grand Lodge was organized in the early eighteenth century, this was associated with St. John the Baptist and celebrated on June 24th. Later the date was shifted, and, it appears St. John the Baptist was supplanted by St. John the Evangelist, but John the Baptist remains the chief patron saint of Freemasonry. The first three Degrees of Freemasonry, known collectively as “Blue Lodge” Masonry, are also called “Johannite Masonry” — that is, the “Masonry of John”. We find this very revealing. The “fish symbolism” of the Vesica Piscis, usually translated ‘fish bladder’ but per - haps, more accurately, ‘Vessel of the Fish’ was incorporated into the great buildings of the Knights Templar, and the legend of the death and rebirth of the High Priest John is incorporated into Aleister Crowley’s play, “ The Ship ” — in which the Vesica"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"Allen H.

This suggests an early origin associated with the great Initiator, the Fish God from Sirius, known as John or Oannes. “In Freemasonry,” Frater Achad tells us, “ Ge - ometry is referred to as the “first and noblest of the Sciences’’ and as “the head of all learning.’’ One of the simplest figures is produced by the intersection of two circles, thus forming what is known as the Vesica Piscis . “The curious and marvelous properties of the Vesica Piscis and of the Rectangle formed on its length and breadth, have been subjects of profound speculation...” The term means ‘fish bladder’ and was the Sign held most sacred by the early Christians, and was the basis for much of the Church architecture of the Gothic period. Kenneth Grant identifies the Vesica with “the Gateway - in this case the gate of ingress for alien forces.” The Vesica shows up again in the impression of the Right foot print of George Adamski’s space contact ORTHON (Orthon has, as previously noted, the same ci - pher value as Jesus), as cast by none other than the ‘secret master’ of the Adamski affair, the enigmatic occultist and UFOlogist, George Hunt Williamson. If we examine the legend of John the Baptist, patron saint of Freemasonry, what do we find? A semi divine teacher, associated with the prophet Elijah (Matthew 11:14, 16:14, 17:12; Mark 6:15, 8:18; Luke 9:19) who ascended alive into heaven in a char - iot of fire before many witnesses (2Kings 2:1-14), John stands half immersed in the water, baptizing others into Wisdom by immersing them. This apparently is an echo of that more remote John, Oannes, the Sumerian-Babylonian half-fish, half man who taught humanity by day, but returned to the waters by night. The only surviving cult of John the Baptist, the Mandeans, live in modern-day Iraq, the former Babylonian and Sumerian Empire. His legend is often confused with that of Jesus, the dying and rising god first il - luminated by John (their followers were in contention with one another for some time after John’s martyrdom). Crowley rightly associates the martyred Jesus with the martyred John, and, in his 777 , gives the Tarot Trump associated with both as “The figure of a hanged or crucified man” with the title “The Spirit of the Mighty Wa - ters”. The customary image of this Tarot Trump is of a man Hanging in an inverted position. This is similar to a relief on the main gate of the Temple Precincts of the late Mayan City Tulum in the Yucatan. The relief is often called “The Diving God” because of the inverted image of a celestial being, and because of the unique coastal"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"Allen H. Greenfield 58 location of “The Temple of the Diving God” at Tulum (the Mayans usually built their cities inland), but seems more like a “divine being descending from Heaven” rather than “diving”. Crowley notes that in the Aeon before that of Osiris, that of Isis or Water, this ‘hanged man’ is instead “The Drowned Man” which takes us back to the approximate time of the visit of the Oannes. The Hebrew name for Jesus, Yehesua, is identical to that of the Old Testament wonder-working prophet, known in English as JOSHUA. JOSHUA = 50 = ODIN and FISH. Joshua was the Son of Nun (that is, son of the fish) and this also refers to a crucified sky god who brings knowledge (as in Odin; see 34° Rite of Memphis, “Knight of Scandinavia”). This is one of those eerie rare exact parallels; JOSHUA and FISH having the same value points to this ancient cryptomasonic tradition of the tutelary (that is, teaching) amphibious star gods. In Masonic lore, the “two Johns” of the New Testament get interchanged in the Eighteenth Century. John the Evangelist is substituted for John the Baptist, but the latter is, in magical lore, associated with the Astrological Sign Cancer and late in the month of June, thus revealing, once again, the same origin in Oannes. Preoccupation with the apparent movements of the planets and stars is conspicuous both among the ancient priesthoods (including some which, like that of the Dogon people, have survived into the present age), and in Freemasonry. The Candidate for the Second, or Fellow Craft Degree (FELLOW CRAFT = 125 = SOTHIS ABLAZE) is told at his initiation that the last seven steps leading to ‘the Middle Chamber of King Solomon’s Temple’ represent “...especially, the seven liberal arts and sciences, which are grammar, rhetoric, logic, arithmetic, geometry, music, and astronomy.” These are, of course, the very arts and sciences taught to humanity by the Gods of Sirius (Sothis) in ancient times. The candidate earlier is conducted by “two large brazen pillars, one on the right and one on the left hand. The name of the one on the left hand is Boaz, and signifies strength; the name of the one on the right is Jachin, and denotes establishment...These are representative of the two pillars erected at the outer porch of King Solomon’s Temple. They are said to have been in height eighteen cubits, twelve in circumference, and four in diameter.” After an excruciatingly de - tailed description, the conductor points to the top of the pillars. “...on the top of each (is) a globe, or ball; these globes are two artificial spherical bodies; on the convex surfaces of which are represented the countries, seas, and vari - ous parts of the earth, the face of the heavens, the planetary revolutions; and are said to be thus extensive to denote the universality of Masonry.” (In 2nd Chronicles 4:12 the spheres are described as “pommels” in the King James Version. The Jewish Publication Society gives the same word as “globes” but not in the modern sense of a spherical world map.) In the York Rite version of this, one of the three most ancient Masonic Rituals, the candidate at last arrives at the station of the Worshipful Master in the East, and his attention is directed to a large letter “G” suspended behind and above the Master. He is told it stands for “Geometry, the first and noblest of sciences.” This seems a late addition, as, in the Misraim (Egyptian Rite) version, at the same moment, the Master"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"Secret Rituals of the Men In Black 59 points to a blazing star and tells the candidate, “Consider this mystic star and let its recollection never depart from your mind. It is the emblem of that genius, which elevates us to great things...” The great Masonic authority Albert Pike boasted that “Sirius still glitters in our Lodges as the Blazing Star.” We need not hesitate to subject the names of the pillars, nor of the degree itself, nor of its pass word, to Qabalistic analysis, using the Ultraterrestrial Cipher. That such names had double or triple Qabalistic (hidden numerical) meanings was already acknowledged in orthodox Masonic sources well over a century ago. Generally, a Hebrew Qabala applies, but, as the spellings used here come from traditional English language Masonic (and Elizabethan English) usage, they may well yield to New Aeon Cipher analysis. If FELLOW CRAFT = VAST SIRIUS, then the pass word, SHIB - BOLETH = 134 ought to refer in some way to a passage from that Star System to our own, and so it does. 134 = SACRED VESSEL (the Vesica Piscis, or cigar shaped ‘fish bladder’) and THE TRUTH. The pillars are JACHIN = 71 = IS A STAR and BOAZ = 36 = SUN. Put together, this tells us that VAST SIRIUS IS A SUN STAR. The dual nature of Sirius is alluded to when we combine the cipher values of BOAZ and JACHIN or 107, the value of TWO PALACES and THE KEYS. That the globes of the Earth and Heavens are referred to could be used to speak against the antiquity of this Degree. But three degree initiatory systems certainly date from antiquity. Furthermore, that the Conductor dwells at such length upon these Globes (said to be hollowed in order to conceal the archives of ancient Masonry), seems itself to be saying something important. It is known that, in the ancient world, there appear to have been accurate source maps of our entire planet. These maps employ spherical trigonometry and implicitly solve problems of latitude and lon - gitude supposedly not solved until relatively modern times. The source maps were still available in Constantinople at the time of Piri Ibn Haji Memmed, who drew a remarkably accurate World Map in 1513. The source maps appear to have been in - credibly old; The Oronteus Finaeus Map of 1531 shows Antarctica in detail, but was obviously drawn from a much earlier root map constructed before the present ice cap overwhelmed the Antarctic Coasts. Someone Knew the true nature of the Earth and the Heavens long ago. And, for some reason, the journeyman Mason, down to the present moment, is shown such knowledge existed. The ancient depiction of Oannes always show him carrying something like a globe with a mesh suggesting latitude and longitude.

Beyond the rank of Sovereign Grand Inspector General of the 33rd Degree, there are a variety of additional esoteric and (some say) “irregular” Degrees. In the system of the Rite of Memphis, there are 97 Degrees in all, and many of these contain rich evidence of a survival of the legend of Ultraterrestrial communication. The very first of these Higher Degrees, the 34th, called “Knight of Scandinavia,” offers the initiate a secret “Runic Cipher” of its own, but, in its recitation of the Leg - end of the Norse God Odin’s quest for knowledge, are many hints of Ultraterrestrial communication. Odin, or Wotan in Teutonic myth, is identified with Hermes, Thoth and other sky gods who, at great cost to themselves (in some cases) come to Earth to teach hu - manity the liberal arts and sciences. We again find reference to the Tarot Card “The Hanged Man” in that the card is sometimes associated with Odin and his doomed son, Balder. This makes the legend yet another version of the teaching god John, or Oannes. The 34th Degree is concerned with “...the Sciences termed Occult or Secret. The temple is a square; the hangings of sky blue, sprinkled with silver stars.”"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"Allen H. Greenfield 62 Throughout the Masonic System, the Star symbolism repeats itself again and again. We are told that the “Sacred Things” of this Degree will be delivered “by knowl - edge brought from Asgaard” that is, the high abode of the gods, by “Sigge, the high priest of our all-father Odin...He it was who established in Scandinavia the secret re - ligious Mysteries and appointed as their Guardian Twelve Great Pontiffs.” Fleeing the Roman General Pompeii, he initiated the Norse King Gylphi into the Mysteries. The initiate is told that before all else there is Muspelsheim, the luminous world. That the Source was beyond our Solar System is hinted at, in quoting the classical Voluspa: “Formerly the sun Knew not his place, The Moon was ignorant of its powers, And the Stars Knew not their stations.” The latter has a double meaning, because it clearly refers to different star constella - tions than those seen on Earth, but has a New Aeon Cipher value of 408, the value of WORK THROUGH THE SECRET CHIEFS, that is, the Ultraterrestrial Masters. Further along, as the basic mythos of the Northern Peoples is unfolded, the candi - date is given to understand that creation, including our world, is the root system of a great Tree. The many “cities” of the heavens are described, as is the Spring of Wisdom from which anyone who drinks is called “Nimis” or “Minis”. Here is one of the cipher tricks which tells the initiate that this story ties into UFOlogy and is more than a fable. Odin, who drinks from the Spring and is thus a Nimis, has a cipher value identical with that of Albert K. Bender’s word of power for calling his Ultraterrestrial visitors, “Kazik”. ODIN = 50 = KAZIK. NIMIS has a cipher value of 86, that of TREE. Remember, the Spring is pointedly at the base of the Great Ash Tree Ydrasil, but also, to show that this exact same motif continues to reoccur in modern UFO contact cases, NIMIS = 86 = SOLIM SOLARA. Bear with me; I will explain. In September of 1994 the present author lectured at the 31st annual National UFO Conference on the Secret Ciphers of the UFOnauts. A member of the audience gave me a small list of words she said she had received in a recent UFO communica - tion. The first was a term, SOLIM SOLARA, which, she was told, was a “mantram to call UFOs”. ODIN, whose ancient name is the numerical equivalent of the “calling mantram KAZIK” (1950s), becomes a NIMIS by drinking from the Spring of Knowledge. NIMIS is the exact numerical equivalent of SOLIM SOLARA, a mantram given for the same purpose in the 1990s. All of this appears in a ritual last revised in English in the year 1911. The ritual goes on to inform the candidate that “there are in heaven very many pleasant cities, and none without a divine garrison.” The end of the world is described, after which a new civilization “...shall arise out of the sea, which has overwhelmed the old, another Earth most lovely and beautiful.” Those who survive, the candidate is told, shall be those that “neither the flood, nor"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"Secret Rituals of the Men In Black 63 the black conflagration” can harm, i.e. those who are space borne or amphibious in nature. The senior initiator, termed “The Highest” now explains the reason for this ritual mythological drama. “There are in it,” he tells the candidate, “traces of the primeval creed which taught that humanity arose from a marriage of Heaven and Earth.” He then creates the can - didate a Knight of Scandinavia, and gives the ritual secrets of the Degree. The Pass Word, SIGGE, in New Aeon Cipher, has a numerical value of 75, equiva - lent of ORDEAL X, the Hermetic Secret Ritual for communion with Higher Beings, mentioned in The Book of the Law , but very old and closely associated with “The Sleep of Siloam” — the ultimate initiation ritual of the Egyptians, a symbolic cru - cifixion and resurrection. It is answered by OROMAZE, meaning most pure light, with a cipher value (81) of ALCHEMY, the secret occult science of transmutation. ODIN, 50, or KAZIK, a word for summoning Ultraterrestrials, is answered by AU - TOPSIE (128), or SPACE SHIP (and THE ORDEAL X). The Pass Word of the final section, ABORIGENE (=138) explained in the ritual text as “society without origin” is equivalent to TITANS & ATLANS, the aboriginal inhabitants of the Earth in the Richard Shaver mythos, to say nothing of classical mythology. As if to show that these cipher equivalents are not arbitrary, ABORIGENE is answered by RUROSTA, or “truth” as the ritual text describes it, and as 78 in cipher, TRUE. In the “Closing Conference” the meaning of the Degree is underscored: “The will can embrace worlds and raise itself towards Divinity...The Alchemists had analogous doctrines, they supposed that the soul must pass through the development of the Seven planets, before it reposed in the center of felicity.” The clue to the real meaning of ‘passing through the development of the Seven planets’ is found in the very Next Degree, the 35th, or Knight of the Temple, which, we should remember, is closely associated with the former ADEPT OF SIRIUS de - gree, already discussed. Particular attention is given in this Degree to “...the apparent motion of the Stars, their velocity, distance, terms, and gravitation.” In short, to ce - lestial navigation. The Pass Word is SIRIUS or DOG STAR, answered by SOTHIS, another name for Sirius, as discussed before. The Tarot Card “The Star,” sometimes called “The Dog Star,” and the seven smaller stars depicted are sometimes said to refer to the seven traditional “planets” while the large central Star ALWAYS refers to Sirius, “the center of felicity.” The card is occasionally referred to as “The Star of the Magi” and, since it depicts nothing associated with the Nativity of Christ, one would assume the reference is to the ancient Persian Order of the Priesthood, the Magi, a prototype of the Masonic Fraternity and the priests of the Oannes of Sirius. The next Degree, the 36th, or “Sublime Negociant” reveals that the 34th, 35th and 36th are something of a “set”. After having learned the mythos of the teacher-visitor from Sirius, the 36th Degree proceeds with a paradoxical “warning” against Star and ‘idol’ worship, with specific reference to the “Astronomical observations of the Priests of Babylon, Chaldea and Sidon. It quotes a chapter in the Islamic Holy Book, The"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"Allen H. Greenfield 64 Koran, being the protests against star and idol worship. The labor is consecrated to Geometry, and astronomy.” The Name of the Degree, “Sublime Negociant” has the same Cipher Value as that of another Degree, significantly named “Commander of the Stars”. The vari - ous words both link it to the Degrees preceding, and, bizarrely enough, to the Inner Circle of Contactee Mark Probert. The Probert sessions, in the 1940s and ‘50s, were, of course, influenced by the late Meade Layne, an occult initiate, as we have elsewhere documented, and a student of the work of Frater Achad, the “father of the Ultrater - restrial ciphers” in a very real sense. The Degree itself dates back to 1780. The Pass Word, MEUNITH = 128 = AUTOPSIE, a word of the 34th Degree (see above) and TWO FOLD NAME. A second Password, TZDIKIM (a peculiar transliteration of the Hebrew Word for “Holy Sages”) has a cipher value of 114, equivalent to THE NAME and, MAHARAJA NATCHA, one of the Probert “Inner Circle” of Ascended Masters existing outside space and time as guardians of humanity against alien in - vasion. This, of itself, could be coincidental, but, when we come to the ‘innocent’ passwords of the next section, we find ABRAHAM = 60 = DJWAL KHUL another of the Himalayan Adepts answered by BRAHMA, which, aside from pointing to the relationship between the legendary idol maker from Chaldea who became the founder of the Hebrew people and the first person of the Hindu Trinity, BRAHMA = 59 = HIWA KAHN, or “Great Beast” — the name Crowley assumed at the time of taking the dictation of The Book of the Law . The Words of Recognition, SARAH = 23 = YADA, the name of another Inner Circle member, answered by WATI SARIS = 97 = OROMAZ & ZAO, used in the same manner in the 34th Degree, confirms that these Degrees are a set. Even the final Word of the Degree, JEHOVAH = 67 = NATALLI, the name of yet another Inner Circle member. At least three members of this circle and a number of similar adepts are discernible in this brief set of Masonic Words from a single Degree, the name of which has the same value, 245, as THE SECRET CHIEFS."},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"65 1 4 T HE U LTRATERRESTRIAL T RAIL IN O THER D EGREES B OTH the names of Degrees, and their contents refer again and again to the lore of the stars in general, the visits of the sky gods, their founding role in Freema - sonry, and their purposes among us. “It has also reference,” the text tells us, “to the Avatars or Savior Gods treated by the Mysteries...Our Order is the depository of all that is valuable to man, as it has preserved, in its temples that which the profane world has long lost...” The seven stars on the Jewel of the 41st Degree point to the fact that “Stellar or Star worship was succeeded by the Sun and Moon.” In the “Prince of Light” or 42nd Degree the candidate is told that “our Order is a social chain which dates from the foundation of the world.” The Sign of the Degree is given as “With index finger of right hand trace the stars; holding an instrument with left hand.” The Word and Password are JAH (or Pole Star in old Arabian lore) and ORION. The 47th Degree is called “Knight of the Seven Stars”. “The most ancient of all Symbols, the 7 Stars of Ursa Major’s annual revolution round the Mystery Sun, a tal - isman (swastika), the seven sisters and their consorts in the Pleiades, one unfaithful.” The notes on the Degree inform us that “The Columns fall - scene changes - flaming star shows the route the adept should take...new calculation of numbers - use and virtue of the mapped signs of the Zodiac.” In the following degree a “new apparition of a Celestial Guide” appears. In the elaborate 49th Degree, “Sublime Sage of the Pyramids”, the candidate is given “a globe round which is twined a serpent, sustained by two open wings.” A note, probably by John Yarker, tells us “The Ancient Arabs believed the Pyramids were Antediluvian.” That is, they were built before the great Universal Flood described in many cultures. In the 51st Degree an important symbol is given; we are told “the Cabiric Pro - metheus stole the fire of heaven to help mankind.” The Symbol is a ladder of 7 steps and above it a star. This seems a clear reference to the Oannes legend. It also hints, by the Word of the Degree, at the Richard Shaver antediluvian world myth. The Word is SISIT, given as “the Chaldean Enoch”. Its value is the same as the Shaverian ‘telepathic broadcasting device’ of the ancient Titans (Prometheus was a Titan; the Degree is named “Sublime Titan of the Caucasus”), or 80 = TELAUG. The 53rd Degree is more explicit. A brazier of fire is surrounded by a Phoenix and a Serpent. The phoenix, in legend is the bird which burns itself to ashes and is reborn from the flames.

SUBLIME KAWI = 149, the same value as the following (64th) Degree, SAGE OF MYTHRAS, already discussed, but a Degree of Great antiquity and deserving of much attention. It speaks of travel to the Stars by the Adepts.The candidate is called “child of Earth” implying the giver of the Degree is something else. The new initiate is given a cipher script, a secret code similar to the later “Royal Arch” cipher. Stellar, that is Star symbolism, continues up through the Degrees.

He was sitting at a table with a blackboard. He gave me a quizzical look and wrote “H1331” on the blackboard. He kept gesturing toward the board and looking at me as if he were trying to tell me something.” Ron Bonds, Publisher, Personal Letter, 8/1/94 “...the mystery of which is that SELF (God) is also SELFLESSNESS which is LA (Not) and for Numeration 31 the Three is One which is None, and the reverse of this Number is 13 which is Unity and Love.” Frater Achad, Book 31 “ Is a God to live in a dog? No! but the highest are of us...” The Book of the Law , II:19 “ I wrenched DOG backwards to find GOD; now GOD barks.” Aleister Crowley, The Book of Lies , Chapter 63 I N traditional (Hebrew) Qabala, AL or “God” — spelled Aleph (1) Lamed (30) has a value of 31, as does LA or “Not” spelled Lamed (30) Aleph (1), but derived in opposite ways. In Qabala, the world is reduced to nothing or, better NO-thing at the highest level, that is, the apparent Opposites are resolved; anything is true only insofar as the reverse is true also - false, only insofar as the reverse also is equally false. The Book of the Law , Liber AL vel Legis , is, in a certain Qabalistic sense, then, the Book of ALLA or LAAL or God and Not God; the Book of the Union of Oppo - sites. This provides a primary Key to understanding the content of the Book, and the several curious uses of the word “Not” (and of the word “God”) therein. If we take the “Dog” in Crowley’s comments to refer to Sirius, the “dog star” of the constella - tion called Canus Major, or the Great Dog, we see that the GOD/NOT reversal is reflected in the English curiosity that “Dog” and God” are the same word spelled in opposite directions. The “Gods of the Dog Star” are “gods” only relative to the"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"Allen H. Greenfield 68 primitive men they appeared among. This speaks to the spiritual implications of hu - man-alien contact. The reverse of 31 is, of course, 13, the Hebrew value of “Achad” (as in Frater Achad, or the Number “One” in Hebrew), also, “Unity” and “Love” — the interplay of 31 (GOD) and 31 (NOT) are united in LOVE (13) and UNITY (13). This is confirmed in another sense in that 31 = GOD in Hebrew Qabala, while its reverse, 13 = EMPTINESS (Beth (2) + Heh (5) + Vau (6) = 13). In this sense, Publisher Ron Bonds’ dream of Crowley pointing to “H1331” reveals the formula “Hebrew: Empti - ness is God,” which duplicates the meaning of Gotama Buddha’s Word “Anata” or ‘No-Soul’ or “Emptiness is the Essence of all things” which is the core Attainment of all schools of meditation. Then, again, if we take the Zero to be Negation, AL (God), or Aleph (1) Lamed (30) is 1.3. or 13, while LA (Not), Lamed (30) Aleph (1) is 3.1. or 31. Keeping in mind that Hebrew is written from Right to Left, this can be read as AL (God) is 31, while LA (Not) is, in this sense, 13, considered using common numerals in an English Language context. One other association, pertaining to New Aeon English Qabala Cipher Six (NAEQ6): It was through the ALLA/LAAL 31/13 paradox that Frater Achad was able to suggest the True Cipher Value of the first three letters (A=1,L=2,W=3; ALW also being an anagram for LAW as in Book of the Law or Word of the Law) of the Cipher. The fourth letter, counting Eleven spaces again through the standard English Al - phabet, is H=4. Thus, in Ron’s dream, Crowley seems to be calling attention to the next letter value H, after Achad’s 1331 work. H1331, then, confirms this work. It is significant that Ron Bonds, of IllumiNet Press, was hard at work on publishing Secret Cipher of the UFOnauts which uses that very ‘code’ generated out of the 1331 ‘password’ of the Great White Brotherhood, at the time of his dream. Achad noted that “...when A.C. first got into touch with the Brothers of the A. A. the Pass word was ‘There is No-God.’ This seems to confirm this Word, as the central secret of A. A.” Crowley described the experience, which took place in the Algerian desert December 12, 1909 in this way: “But the Angel that was with me lifted me, and I saw the edge of the altar, as I must call it...One of them bends forward so that I may whisper the pass-word. The Angel prompts me to whisper: ‘There is no God.’ So they let me pass, and though there was indeed nothing visible therein, yet there was a very strange atmosphere, which I could not understand. “Suspended in the air there is a silver star, and on the forehead of each of the guard - ians there is a silver star...” “...I think the difference in the way the English and Hebrew Alphabets are writ - ten, “ Achad noted, “is a good symbol of this, the direction is different, so that the same two letters might stand for either LA or AL according to the manner in which we look upon them. The great value of this Word lies in the fact that the self-same"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"Secret Rituals of the Men In Black 69 symbol contains the ideas of Nothing and Something, without any change in itself, and this seems to be the one Symbol that gets over the difficult transition from NOT to ONE.” It is also true that if 13 be taken for LA, and 31 for AL, and H for itself, it forms an anagram for ALLAH, the Islamic name of deity and, from a magical perspective, the Word of the Magus Mohammed."},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"Allen H.

While most of these source maps disappeared with the burnings of the Library at Alexandria, which survived until the 7th Century, that of Carthage which the Romans destroyed, and other repositories of traditional wisdom, enough fragmentary source maps remained in Constantinople and elsewhere for me - dieval cartographers to formulate imperfect copies of world maps and area maps of great antiquity and accuracy, though their own inferior knowledge allowed many er - rors, including those of projection, to distort some features. The medieval portolano charts, the famous world map of Piri Muhyi ‘l-Din Reis of 1513, the Oronteus Finae - us world map of 1532 and others all suggest a very ancient knowledge of latitude and longitude, all the continents including Antarctica, the use of complex trigonometry, etc. in the source map or maps. In some of these maps Antarctica appears with ice free coasts and running rivers, and glaciers are shown in various areas, also indicating an incredibly primeval genesis. While some effort has been made to link this knowledge to prehistoric civilizations, no such civilizations are known to have existed. An aerial survey, perhaps shared with early human civilizations is suggested. From very early times the oldest civilizations show a great reverence for certain stars, particularly Sirius, the brightest Star in the heavens, in the constellation Canus Ma - jor, the “Great Dog”. Interest in the Sun and Moon had obvious agricultural mean - ing, but the attempt to link the extremely early Egyptian fascination with the double star Sirius as being related to the beginning of the Flooding of the Nile is brought into question by the world wide attention to that brightest of the fixed stars. The Sumerians and later Babylonians often depicted Sirius as a sort of wheel in their great works of art, and the Anasazi peoples of the Southwestern North American Conti - nent built special Temples to catch the rising and setting light of Sirius on significant days, as had the early Egyptians. The Anasazi, whose origins and even real name are unknown, appeared out of nowhere and disappeared in pre-Columbian times. The Sumerians were of similar unknown origin; they just appeared. The two thousand year old Moose Mountain medicine wheel in Canada is also oriented to catch Sirius in its rising at Midsummer dawn, as are more recent Amerindian medicine wheels. The similarity between the medicine wheels in North America, and the depiction of Sirius in Babylonian plaques (as in the Lamashtu Plaque) is remarkable."},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"Allen H. Greenfield 72 Within the structure of Freemasonry is a continuation of the reverence for Sirius, and of an ancient legend of a humanoid but fish-like being, called the Oannes, who brought to ancient Mesopotamia the working tools of civilization, law, writing, ar - chitecture and culture. The Oannes established an initiatory priesthood to carry for - ward this knowledge, and this forms the core of Freemasonry. The Oannes is often depicted as a fish man with Sirius over his head, or that of his (later) priests. He is said to have spent the days among men, and the nights in the depth of the Persian Gulf. The Byzantine Eastern Orthodox Patriarch Photius (820-893) informs us the beings arrived from the sky in luminous eggs, which put down in the Gulf. The fish god symbolism shows up in the stories of the Mesopotamian god Odocon, or Dagon, later taken up by the Canaanites, the Phoenicians and at last the Carthaginians, be - fore their destruction by the Romans. The story shows up in the form of the wonder- working prophet Joshua, the son of Nun (Yeheshua, the fish’s son) later reflected in the story of Jesus (Yeheshua), whose sign was the fish (Vesica Piscis, or Vessel of the Fish), whose chief disciple was a fisherman called “The Big Fisherman”, who could walk on water and produce fishes miraculously. His card became “The Hanged Man” formerly “The Drowned Man” . The Freemasons revere yet another guise of the same story, John the Baptist, whose feast day, June 24th, coincides with the Summer Solstice and the ancient feast day of The Oannes, “Oannes” meaning “John”. The Grand Lodge of Speculative Free - masonry was founded on June 24, 1717, in honor of that Saint. It was on June 24th of 1947 that the traditional ‘first’ flying saucer sighting took place in the Pacific Northwest. The Oannes myth has been linked to the Celtic Guoydion legends, and the Jonah or Ionas of Babylonia, Hebrew and Chaldean myth. The Biblical Jonah is swallowed and disgorged by a great fish to teach in the Babylonian City of Ninevah. The symbolism continues to the present time. In the reign of Henry VIII Cardinal John Fisher was martyred for his loyalty to Roman Catholicism and opposition to the King’s divorce of Catherine of Aragon. He was executed on June 22nd, 1535, the traditional day when the Sun enters the Sign of Cancer, which is associated with Sirius and the “Dog Days” of Summer because of Cancer’s former association with the Summer Solstice. John Fisher was made a Saint by the Roman Catholic Church in 1935, with June 22nd given as his feast day. Consider the date, his first and last names. Still more recently, Philip K. Dick, the visionary author of V.A.L.I.S . (“Vast Active Living Intelligence System”) and other modern Gnostic works, who associates VA - LIS with the Vesica Piscis, experienced a profound mystical transformation in 1974. Shortly before his death he told Greg Rickman that, being in tremendous pain from a tooth extraction: I came home and I was in great pain.

Ron Hubbard between January 4 and March 4, 1946, has been the object of much speculation, mythologising and wonder. This speculation is due in part to the involvement of two charismatic and brilliant Bohemians of that period. Parsons (1914-1952) was a major force in the early devel - opment of solid fuel booster rockets, for which work the International Astronomical Union eventually named a Lunar Crater in his memory. He was an O.T.O. member from 1941, and served for a short period as Master of Agape Lodge O.T.O. in the 1940s. He died under mysterious circumstances in an explosion in 1952. The other participant, pulp fiction author La Fayette Ron Hubbard (1911-1986), eventually founded the Church of Scientology and has been the center of stormy controversy in the decades since. Both men were students of magick, especially the sexual magick of Aleister Crow - ley. According to Bent Corydon, Hubbard once confided in his son, Ron Jr., “ Secrets, techniques and powers I alone have refined, improved on, applied my engineering principles to. Science and logic. THE keys! My keys to the doorway of the Magick; my magick! THE power! NOT Scientology power! MY power! The real powers of Solomon...” Hubbard Sr. made clear he was talking about the sex magick central to the OTO system, but with a unique twist: “ Sex by will, Love by will — no caring and no sharing — no feelings...Sex is the route to power. Scarlet women! They are the secret to the doorway. Use and consume. Feast. Drink the power through them. Waste and discard them.” 2 The idealist Jack Parsons could hardly have understood what sort of man he was dealing with here; he wrote Crowley in February, 1946: “About three months ago I met Ron...He is a gentleman...He moved in with me about two months ago, and although Maggy and I are still friendly, she has trans - ferred her sexual affections to Ron.” 3 1 In point of fact, Adamski had been trying to sell his Venusian story as science fiction several years earlier — that is, at about the same time as Parsons alleged experience in New Mexico. 2 Quoted from L. Ron Hubbard, Messiah or Madman? by Bent Corydon and L. Ron Hubbard, Jr. (Lyle Stuart, 1987) p. 307. 3 op.cit . pp. 255-56 ."},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"Secret Rituals of the Men In Black 75 While Parsons was convinced that Hubbard, as he wrote Crowley, “...is in com - plete accord with our own principles” 4 and proceeded to enter into a joint financial venture with the future Father of Scientology, Crowley was writing his eventual suc - cessor as O.T.O. Grand Master, Karl Germer, “From our brother’s account he has given away both his girl and his money - apparently it’s the ordinary confidence trick.” 5 Parson’s friend Alva Rogers, who witnessed these events as they unfolded, described Hubbard’s role in this way: “Ron was a persuasive and unscrupulous charmer, not only in social groups, but with the ladies. He was so persuasive and charmingly unscrupulous that within a matter of a few weeks he brought the entire house of Parsons down around poor Jack’s ears. He did this by the simple expedient of taking over Jack’s girl for extended periods of time.” 6 It was against this background that Parsons and Hubbard embarked upon “The Ba - balon Working” — an elaborate sexual magick experiment designed to bring Babalon into physical manifestation. The whole concept of the “Magical Child” has several distinct interpretations. In the more orthodox and traditional view, sex magick is employed to Manifest, by an act of Pure Will, a magical being the material basis of which are the sexual fluids themselves. A more literal interpretation holds that magical ritual such as “The Star Sapphire” will produce a “Moon Child” — that is, a living child who serves as host to a superbeing, that is, the child is an “avatar” in Eastern terms, or an Incarnation of the Divine in Western thought. Yet a third interpretation is that sex magick is, simply, the “Yoga of Sex” and the “Magical Child” is the Transformed Sex Magician Himself! Hubbard and Parsons were ostensibly aiming at the second, literal interpretation; to manifest a Scarlet Woman willing to conceive a child who would embody the transformative goddess-being Babalon. Crowley wrote Germer: “Apparently Parsons or Hubbard or somebody is produc - ing a moonchild. I get fairly frantic when I contemplate the idiocy of these louts. ” 7 The reaction was certainly excessive. Crowley’s successor as Grand Master of the O.T.O. in the 1980s, Hymenaeus Beta, noted that an adequate chronicle of Parsons’ “now - famous ‘Babalon Working’ of 1946 EV has yet to be published...Most pub - lished accounts focus on his friendship and falling-out with Church of Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard without appraising the larger issues of what was actually being attempted, and why.” 8 Certainly, Parsons’ own description of the Working is based in the fundamentals of Ceremonial and Sexual Magick. In “The Book of Babalon - January 4 - March 4, 1946 EV” Parsons outlines the entire experiment, including the reasons for it: 4 op. cit. p. 256 5 op. cit. p. 258 6 op. cit. p. 259 7 op. cit. p. 257, but frequently quoted in various sources; See also Crowley’s novel Moonchild . 8 Freedom Is A Two Edged Sword by John W.

This force relates to fire, Mars, and the Sun, that is, to power, violence and energy... “This force is completely blind, depending upon the men and women in whom it manifests and who guide it... “The catastrophic trend is due to our lack of understanding of our own natures. The hidden lusts, fears, and hatreds resulting from the warp-ing of the love urge, which underlie the natures of all Western peoples, have taken a homicidal and sui - cidal direction . “This impasse is broken by the incarnation of another sort of force, called BABA - LON. The nature of this force relates to love, understanding, and dionysian free - dom, and is the necessary counterbalance or correspondence to the manifestation of Horus.” Thus far, Parsons is reasoning in a sound manner. Keep in mind, however, that he is working with his ‘friend’ Hubbard, then in the very process of making off with Parsons’ money and lover; a man who was to tell his son, Ron Jr., a few years later, to use and discard Scarlet Women. In what sense “scarlet?” the younger Hubbard asked. “Scarlet,” the Scientology ‘Source’ replied, “the blood of their bodies; the blood of their souls...bend their bodies; bend their minds; bend their wills; beat back the past.” 9 This is the grossest perversion of Crowley’s teaching. The latter merely observed in the same context, “We do opine that it is better and easier that the other party should be in ignorance of the sacred character of the Office. It is enough if that assistant be formed by Nature signally for the physical task, robust, vigorous, eager, sensible, hot and healthy; flesh, nerve and blood being tense, quick, and lively, easily enflamed, and nigh inextinguishable.” 10 Crowley is telling us that a partner in sexual magick should, ideally, in his opinion, be involved for the sake of sensual pleasure, pure and simple. Hubbard is telling his own son how to enslave minds, bodies and souls. Parsons, who wrote extensively on the subject of freedom, could have had no idea of what type of person he was engaged in High Magick with. In any case, Parsons goes on to narrate that “In January 1946 I had been engaged in the study and practice of Magick for seven years, and in the supervision and op - eration of an occult lodge for four years 11 , having been initiated into the Sanctuary of the Gnosis by the Beast 666, Fra. 132, and Fra. Saturnus 12 . At this time I decided 9 Corydon & Hubbard, op. cit . p. 307. 10 De Arte Magica . 11 Agape Lodge O.T.O. 12 This is a significant “crew” of initiators, indeed.

According to Parsons, at various times over subsequent days, wind storms were raised, electrical power was disrupted (January 14), during which Hubbard allegedly had a candle knocked from his hand by Something; several witnesses saw a “brownish yel - low light about seven feet high” 16 which Parsons banished. 17 On January 18 Parsons and Hubbard were out in the Mojave Desert when Parsons suddenly had an epiphany, and realized the experiment was accomplished. 18 “I re - turned home,” he tells us, “and found a young woman answering the requirements 19 waiting for me.” For the next month he invoked BABALON with her as his partner, “as was proper to one of my grade” 20 — in other words, by the sexual Eucharist of the Mass of the Holy Ghost. While his magical partner visited in New York, on February 28, Parsons returned to the Mojave, and received a “communication” he referred to as Liber 49, The Book of Babalon , which identifies its source as Babalon Herself. It should be noted that Hubbard was also away then. Liber 49 asserts, among other things, “The working is of nine moons...And she shall wander in the witchwood under the Night of Pan, and know the mysteries of the Goat and the Serpent, and of the children that are hidden away...I will provide the place and the material basis, thou the tears and blood...Thy tears, thy sweat, thy blood, thy semen, thy love, thy faith shall provide. Ah, I shall drain thee like the cup that is of me, Babalon 21 ...Let me behold thee naked and lusting after me, calling upon my name...Let me receive all thy manhood within my Cup, climax upon climax, joy upon joy...Gather together in the covens as of old...Gather together in secret, be naked and shameless and rejoice in my name.” 22 It is interesting that much of this anticipates the emergence of Wicca, at a time when Gerald Gardner in England was only beginning to formulate his ideas.

Greenfield 78 spent much of the remainder of his short magical career writing on the subject of ‘witchcraft’ . In any event, when Parsons communicated the Good News to Crowley, the old Magus was perplexed, or amused, or, conceivably both. He wrote Parsons, “You have me completely puzzled by your remarks. I thought I had a morbid imagi - nation, as good as any man’s, but it seems I have not. I cannot form the slightest idea what you can possibly mean.” Apparently undaunted, upon Hubbard’s return Parsons prepared to impregnate his magical partner, impressed by a vision Hubbard had “of a savage and beautiful woman riding naked on a great cat-like beast.” According to Francis King’s account, “Parsons was High Priest and had sexual intercourse with the girl, while Hubbard who was present acted as scryer, seer, or clairvoyant” This occurred on the first three days of March, 1946. The aftermath is the subject of much rumor, and points out the high significance of sexual magick. “This secret is the true Key to Magick,” said Crowley, “that is, by the right use of this secret man may impose his Will on Nature herself...” Hubbard took off with Parsons’ former partner and the funds of their joint enterprise. Parsons caught up with Hubbard in July of 1946 in Miami, having to evoke Bartzabel 23 to raise a storm at sea, forcing Hubbard back to shore. Ron Hubbard nevertheless mar - ried Parsons’ former lover the following month, and went on to write Dianetics, The Science of Mental Health and, eventually, to organize the Church of Scientology, built on a hidden mythos of a 75 million year old disaster in which the inhabitants of a 76 planet galactic federation were blown up by a dictator named Xenu. This science fiction ‘space opera’ from Hubbard’s pulp fiction days forms a bizarre underpinning to an already bizarre story. 24 For the rest of it, it depends entirely on whom you talk to. Was a “magical child” — conceived ritually March 4, 1946, born into this world as Babalon Incarnate on or about “nine moons” later, on or about December 4, 1946? Is such a being, a woman of about 50, alive today? Or was there a more ethereal ‘birth’ — perhaps, on a spiritual level, the true “birth date” of Gardnerian Wicca and its various descendent bodies, and on a more material level, the birth of modern ‘second wave’ feminism. Surely, the timing of the Babalon Working and the arrival of the Post War Baby Boom is simultaneous in an eerie sort of way. UFO buffs have of late been touting a theory that Hubbard came to Parsons with a purpose more grandiose than “the or - dinary confidence game”. In pulp magazine circles, he had encountered any number of occultists and border occultists (Talbot Mundy, Col. Arthur Burks, Major Donald Keyhoe, Ray Palmer and Richard S. Shaver come to mind 25 ), and had already formu - lated the core of the “inner Scientology teaching” outlined above. He wished to bring this other world into Manifestation, but lacked the technical knowledge to do so. So, he came to the innocent sex magician Jack Parsons.

Greenfield 80 E PILOGUE : T HE C IPHER T RAIL IN THE B OOK OF B ABALON T HE New Aeon Qabala (NAEQ6), also known as “the Secret Cipher of the UFOnauts ” reveals a great deal about Parsons, Hubbard, and The Book of Babalon itself. Hubbard almost certainly used his considerable charismatic and hypnotic ability to implant Parsons with a bogus “4th Chapter of The Book of the Law ” — but he could not resist leaving his signature all over it, in terms of his name, ideas and motives, encrypted in the UFOnaut Cipher. He probably learned the cipher from his pulp magazine occultist connections. Elsewhere, I have demonstrated that Ray Palmer and Richard Shaver were using the cipher, or something much like it, throughout the 1940s, in the pages of Amazing Stories and elsewhere. La Fayette Ron Hubbard came out of this same circle. In “Cipher 6” as it is called, LA FAYETTE RON HUBBARD has a value of 248, identical to the value of the name, number and first several words of The Book of Babalon, or Liber 49. LA FAYETTE RON HUBBARD = 248 = LIBER 49 1. YEA IT IS. He also en - crypted his intent in the same value in the text. 248 = BABALON AND I SHALL BE FREE. Hubbard, we recall, according to biographer Bent Corydon, spoke to his son Ron, Jr. about the blood of the Scarlet Woman in terms of being the key to ‘real power’. “The blood of their bodies, the blood of their souls,” as he put it. It should therefore come as no surprise that L. RON HUBBARD = 115 = BLOOD TO BLOOD in The Book of Babalon. The Book of Babalon also refers to future witch covens as of eleven, strange wording (as covens are traditionally 13), until one applies NAEQ6: COVENS = 74, or 7+4= 11! The third party to the Babalon Working, the late Margerie Cameron Parsons always referred to herself simply as “Cameron”, hav - ing the value of 93, the traditional number of both “love” and “will” the forces of the New Aeon. Hubbard’s later assertions about the mad extraterrestrial dictator Xenu also shows up in The Book of Babalon and more generally in Crowleyan literature. XENU = 78 = ALL POWER and FIRE and MAGICK and MY STAR and NUIT, the latter being the Egyptian (and Crowlean) Star Goddess. The nonsense name given to Earth by Hubbard in the Xenu legend, TEEGEE - ACK = 158 = BABALON TIME in The Book of Babalon , but also NINE MOONS , the gestation cycle of human beings. More ominously, as Xenu regarded Earth as a disposable backwater planet, TEEGEEACK = 158 = AN APPENDIX. Most signifi - cantly, defying all chance expectations, TEEGEEACK = 158 = PLANET EARTH! Dozens of such Hubbard-specific phrases exist in this Book, suggesting that Parsons, in writing it, was responding to a posthypnotic suggestion by Hubbard. Parsons then apparently proceeded to “open a door” and the era of flying saucers began."},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"81 P OSTSCRIPT — T HE S TUFF OF D REAMS “When a thing is hidden away with so much pains, merely to reveal it is to destroy it.” Tertullian. I N 1980 I ran into the dead end wall that many UFOlogists have encountered in their research. The evidence I had accumulated suggested to me that the UFO mystery was something closely akin to an infinite series of nested boxes, and that illusion after illusion after illusion produced much speculation but little useful infor - mation. My old friend Gene Duplantier had once described UFOlogy as “like a long walk down an endless tube,” and many of the best , most thoughtful students of the subject, on realizing this, simply gave up. Ten years were to pass before another break came my way in the form of the Ultra - terrestrial Cipher that provided the breakthrough that explains, for me, not only the UFOs, but many Masonic pass words, ancient legends and occult secrets. I stumbled upon the cipher; I did not invent it, owe no allegiance to it, make no claims for it other than that it “fits” easily the subject matter I have applied it to in this and my previous work, Secret Cipher of the UFOnauts . I regard it as experimental, but consider it a working solution to some of the most profound enigmas thoughtful people have dwelt upon over the last several centuries. Two things to take note of: First, in discussing various Masonic degrees, words and “secrets” I have been at some pain to avoid violation of the ritual privacy of these so - cieties. The Degrees I have discussed are, essentially, archaic (that is, no longer work - ing) Degrees from the York and Memphis systems. The York materials are available at virtually every book store in Duncan’s Ritual of Freemasonry. The Memphis materials exist in manuscript form, but are not held under copyright and have recently been published in modern editions based in John Yarker’s work. I have avoided quoting or referring to any ritual not routinely in current public distribution or available at book stores. In passing I will say that to read about a ritual is not to perform it. Such rituals are “Mystery Plays” and are fully understandable only in the doing, not merely in the telling. Second, there is a sense in which the Oannes Mythos, the Mystery Plays and Ritu - als presented here, the very Ultraterrestrial Visitors themselves inherently overlap with the stuff of dreams. They represent a Reality more profound than our own, and as such cannot be taken verbatim or too literally. In this volume I have pulled out the stops and taken a plunge beyond the Reality Barrier. What I have found is the core of the Ultraterrestrial Secret, too numinous to be other than ineffible. When there are no words to literally describe what one knows, one speaks in the language of mythos. So have I done. “To puzzle out an imaginary meaning for this ‘nonsense’ sets one thinking of the Myster - ies; one enters into deep contemplation of holy things and God Himself leads the soul to real illumination.” A.

Wriste recently observed the rising of Sirius at the Summer Solstice on a two thousand year old medicine wheel in Canada. I invited him to view the first draft of this book. I interviewed him in September of 1994 for this volume.] Allen H. Greenfield : So, Terry, I understand you performed my proposed “ul - traterrestrial technology” version of the Bornless One ritual at an old medicine wheel on the Summer Solstice. What happened? Terry R. Wriste : I should tell you, o guru wannabe, I was very skeptical about your ritual. Not the experimentation as such, you know, because we agree that this is all open season stuff, but this particular deal....anyhow, the moment of the rising of Sirius before the Sun breaks is an eerie blue magick all its own. I didn’t meet the Oannes or whatever, but I got the oddest auditory sensation of my life, like I was under water. I asked the girl I was with, Katy, and she was in a sort of trance by the time the sun broke the horizon. She said, “I felt like a dolphin” and that was that. Enough? AHG : For a first try and outdoors at that, I guess. Terry, you have reviewed the draft manuscript for Secret Rituals of the Men in Black . To put it bluntly, what, in your opinion, have I missed or neglected to say? TRW : Well, for starters you might have given more attention to two facts about the Star Sirius. One, in favor of any kind of ‘visitation’ hypothesis, is the fact that Sirius is less than nine light years from Earth. This means that, assuming an advanced civilization in that area, a visit every now and then, even using technology not far beyond our own present capacities is feasible. On the down side, though, Sirius is a rather young star, and there would be considerable question in conventional terms as to whether, supposing there are planets there, life, let alone advanced intelligent life, amphibious or not, has had time to evolve . AHG : This is assuming, of course, that Sirius is the home star of the Oannes, rather than some sort of base, or portal. TRW : Exactly. And I know, of course, that you make no such assumption. Neither you nor I have ever assumed that Ultraterrestrials are either benevolent or truthful. But the issue could be clarified for the reader. The constellation Canus Major, the Great Dog, is configured as if to sweep ahead of Orion the Hunter, the “dog’s” mythi - cal master. Alpha Canus Major, or Sirius, called “the dog star” is not only the bright - est Star in the constellation, but the brightest in the sky. With an apparent magnitude of -1.4, Sirius is actually a dual star system only 8.7 light years from Earth. Sirius A is a hot type-A white star, it is orbited once every 50 years by Sirius B, known as “the"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"Secret Rituals of the Men In Black 83 pup,” a white dwarf. The mass of Sirius A is about twice that of our sun, while Sirius B is incredibly dense. Though supposedly the dual nature of the system has been known for only about a century, a number of traditional African tribal peoples have retained a detailed knowledge in their initiatory rituals of Sirius B. Most well known are the Dogon, but other related peoples also are aware of this. The Egyptians orient - ed a number of their Temples on the rising and setting of Sirius, with the light of the Star being caught on the temple’s inner altar. Other ancient structures, including the Bighorn Medicine Wheel in Wyoming, but conspicuously not including Stonehenge in Britain, are oriented on Sirius. Canus Major is, as mentioned, associated in myth with Orion, its apparent neigh - bor. It is closely associated with Taurus, containing the fabled “Seven Sisters” or The Pleiades. The associated constellation Canus Minor, “the small dog” contains the Star Procyon. This is Orion’s other mythic hunting dog. Sirius is also associated with the constellation Cancer the Crab which, in ancient times, was associated with the Sum - mer Solstice and the “Dog Days of Summer” associated with Sirius, aligned with the Greek word “seirios” meaning scorching. Sirius in Canus Major, Procyon in Canus Minor and Betelgeuse in Orion form an apparent equilateral triangle in the heavens as viewed from Earth. It is of more than passing interest that Sirius, Procyon, The Pleiades and Orion are names which show up quite often in the lore of UFOlogy and contacteeism. The contact-source identified as “Semjase” from the Pleiades in the cases of Fred Bell and Billy Meier is an example. In occult lore, “Semjaza” (or Semyaza, Semiaza, Shem - hazai, etc.) is the fallen angel Azza, or Uzza, a seraph who was tempted by Ishtar to reveal the Secret Explicit Name. This relates to the Masonic Third Degree, in which the Grand Master is slain for failure to reveal the “Master’s Word” to ruffians. Semjaza is said to hover between heaven and Earth with lowered head, in the constellation Orion. According to The Book of Jubilees , Semjaza is one of the Watchers sent from Heaven to instruct humanity. Semjaza taught humanity what might be called “witch - craft” — herbalism, enchantments, etc. AHG : Consider it clarified. What else? TRW : Well, about the Bambara, the Dogon and other African peoples’ knowledge of these matters... AHG : I had sort of thought Robert Temple had covered that so well in The Sirius Mystery that I hesitated to repeat his data. I wanted to concentrate on the survival of the Oannes legend in Freemasonry, through applying the Ultraterrestrial Cipher contained in The Book of the Law . TRW : Sure, but time slips by. Keep in mind Temple’s book came out twenty years ago, and there is now a whole generation that may not know what he had to say. In essence, the Dogon and other tribal peoples which had contact, through trade routes and the migration of peoples in ancient times, with the Berber-Carthegenian- GrecoRoman world, have accurate information on the fifty year rotation of Sirius B, its incredible mass, knowledge of the stars and planets, the human circulatory system"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"Allen H. Greenfield 84 and other matters as astoundingly out of historical sequence as the old maps of a preglacial Antarctica which, they say, was brought to them by ‘fish men’ from Sirius called Nommo, paralleling exactly the Babylonian Oannes, the Phonecian Dagon, and so forth. The name of the Dogon people is derived, almost certainly, from that of the fish-god Dagon. It also reminds me a bit of “NEMO” as Crowley described his encounter in the Enochian Aethyrs. Crowley scryed the 13th Aethyr, called”ZIM” on December 4th, 1909 in a river bed near Bou-Saada in North Africa. He meets a being called “Nemo”. The whole vision is much like the North African version of the Oannes legend. Crowley’s “Nemo” and the Dogon “Nommo” seem cut from the same fish. AHG : What are we to make of the “John” legend itself? TRW : In following the “John” legend through history, I think it is important to note that the recurrent John/Fish/Sirius motif doesn’t necessarily mean that, say, Jesus or John the Baptist were mere mythical stand-ins for the earlier Oannes. You mention, for example, Saint John Fisher in the time of Henry the VIII, who was certainly his - torical, as, unquestionably, was your literary hero Phil Dick. AHG : True enough. I can think of two alternatives to various “Johns” being mythical in the popular sense; one is that real historical personages become closely associated with the Oannes legend in and out of Freemasonry because they share common ar - chetypal roots. Summer Solstice, miraculous knowledge or salvation from the skies, association with fish or with water or both strikes an archetypal chord, so that the same names and themes recur over and over in very real people. TRW : But, don’t you think that theme gets worked to death? I think of the brilliant Alvin Kuhn, and before him Gerald Massey, seeking out the archetypal connections so carefully that any physical person or event gets lost in the forest of words. Take Kuhn’s analysis of the “Ark” as in Noah and the many other less familiar stories of the same ilk. Absolutely everything gets discussed as a possibility, except the prospect that the Ark may have been a Vessel in very Truth, but not of the oceans of the earth, but of the depths of space. Not a Chalice, or the Womb or a Ritual Tomb, but a Celestial Ship. AHG : True, though some of this work certainly hits on our basic theme. You men - tion Alvin Kuhn’s work. Let me quote something for you from The Lost Light pub - lished over half a century ago. [pause] “...Jesus, Horus, Ioannes and others came as Ichthys (Ichthus), ‘fish’ in Greek. And we have the fish-avatar of Vishnu. The door of life is figured in the shape of a fish- mouth at the western or feminine end of a church. The Pope’s miter is the mouth of a fish. The soul of life comes by way of the water.” Now, it seems to me that all this carries forward and sings to us because it does strike an archetypal chord, as Jung and Campbell and others have shown. But they seem to trace to an historical event or events that, in a sense “play out” the archetypal myth. I doubt that Jonah was swollowed by a fish. But a “fish vessel” or a vessel for"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"Secret Rituals of the Men In Black 85 the fish-being is not nearly as unbelievable. Which brings me to the second point. In modern initiatory societies such as the Golden Dawn, it is common custom to adopt a spiritual motto, and to change that motto in keeping with stages of develop - ment spiritually. I suspect strongly that this is an ages-old practice, and initiates of the Oannes Mysteries may have adopted the name “John” or a variation, as well as the fish symbols and star symbols we have discussed. Thus we can as easily see Jesus as a spiritual motto adopted upon initiation by a veritable adept. Not long after Jesus another Messiah-figure arose among the Jews and raised an army of a million against Rome. He was called, “Simon, Son of a Star”. You can bet that that was an initiatory name. Sirius in Canis Major, or “The Great Dog.” TRW : So the Egyptians keeping time by the Dog Star doesn’t triviliaze the Visitation premise. Gerald Massey informs us that “the first time observed and registered was Sut-Typhonian; its types were the Great Bear and the Dog-star. In this time the year began with the rising of Sothis...“ that’s “Sirius” — and the Egyptians were certainly concerned with the flooding of the Nile, but I doubt that this much concerned the Anasazi in Arizona nor for that matter the Babylonians, who were just as fixated on Sirius. One truth melds with the other. The motif of the “teacher from the stars” has many faces, but the very fact of its recurrence is of great importance. The Yada Di Shi’ite... AHG : We should recall that the Yada Di Shi’ite was the Chief of the Inner Circle group of Ascended Masters channeled by Mark Probert from at least the mid 1940s, and heavily promoted by Meade Layne. The Yada, or High Priest, lived in a Himala - yan civilization called “Yuga” half a million years ago, according to the channelings. TRW : Yes, exactly. In any event, speaking through Probert to Bryant and Helen"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"Allen H. Greenfield 86 Reeves, I would guess in San Diego in late April of 1955, he said [quoting] “In the early period of the earth’s affairs when man was beginning to show signs of thinking, space beings came to earth and instructed man on various secret things, not only regarding the planetary system but regarding their own inner living as well. Some of the greatest teachings man has received came to him by these space beings in order that various civilizations could advance more rapidly.” This brings to mind everything from the story of the God Thoth in Egypt, or Oannes in Sumer, to Semjase in Cali - fornia in modern times. AHG : That brings us to the Central Question. We see the Knights of Malta bus - ily supressing the entire mythos, but Kenneth Grant routinely trots out his rather unusual version of the same in book after book. We see the mythos of the Oannes repeated again and again in cipher form in Masonic Ritual, and we see the same cipher showing up in ceremonial magick, UFOlogy and elsewhere. Clearly George Hunt Williamson would have a very different reason for introducing these ideas into “New Age” thought than, say, Meade Layne. Yet we see evidence that both have done so in the contactee lore. Are we talking about the unadulterated reality here, or yet another “mask of the unknown”? TRW : Both. You’ve established the existence of the cipher pretty well in the previous volume, and I think here you’ve established how it is used in Masonic Ritual to pass a mythos down through the ages. You might want to make this a trilogy one day, and devote a volume to what is mythic in this mythos, and what is literally real. I have seen a lot of strange stuff in both occultism and UFOlogy, and you are right on the ‘answer’ for anyone with eyes to see. AHG : As the case may be, we’ll see what people do with this stuff. What is the strangest thing you have seen in your decades chasing UFOs. TRW : The strangest thing is in figuring out why the UFOnauts abduct people, and what stops them from doing so. Since magical ritual contacts them and banishes them, we know either that they are magical beings, or magick is a technology, or both. But when I started working with Reichian technologies the Knights of Malta would give their fortunes to have, I noticed something most strange. UFOs can be disintegrated by Reichian energies. AHG : Well, that’s strange, but hardly new; Reich himself said he did that in the ‘50s. TRW : Right. But consider what Reich worked with. He called it “Orgone Energy” which was a direct outgrowth of his work with Freudian Psychotherapy. Up through a certain point, he was an orthodox Freudian, until he discovered that the very en - ergies that Freud addressed in psychological terms were explainable as a Universal Energy or Current, a kind of ‘orgasmic flux’ inherent in the universe, which could be channeled, quantified and, apparently, used to shoot down flying saucers. Orgone Energy, it seems to me, is identical to the Love/Will current of Aleister Crowley’s Book of the Law. AHG : Wait a minute. Are you telling me that the energy behind human libido de - stroys Ultraterrestrial craft? TRW : “They drink our fear, like hungry ghosts. To drink instead our love is death unto them and their kin.” AHG : Who are you quoting?

October 15, 1995, Atlanta, GA. I want to tell you a very bizarre story; strange even in the lore of UFOlogy. I assert — and I have argued persuasively I think, both in my current books Secret Cipher of the UFOnauts and Secret Rituals of the Men In Black , — that contending alien pres - ences have not only been visiting the Earth, but interpenetrating our civilizations since remote antiquity. Some of these presences are incredibly advanced beings — in fact, saying they are “from outer space” is simply too narrow — and I generally prefer my old friend John Keel’s term “Ultraterrestrials”. For various reasons that I will go into presently, these alien intelligences have many so-called “deep agents” who live among us, sometimes for centuries. They have been communicated with since time immemorial through deceptively simple codes and ciphers, which are changed periodically. Occultists have used such codes for centuries. The “rules” by which such ciphers are decoded have, in fact, not changed for at least a thousand years, possibly much longer. The rules are contained in a venerable body of knowledge loosely defined as “Qabalism” from the Hebrew word “Qabala” which means “hidden” or “secret”. A whole new, English-language based cipher was dictated by an Ultraterrestrial source to Queen Elizabeth the First’s Astrologer Royal, Dr. John Dee through the trance channeling of Sir Edward Kelly several hundred years ago. It was called “the language of the Angels” written in a script directly translatable into English. Now, Dee and Kelly were human beings and in fact served their government as espionage agents. They may well have used this Ultraterrestrial Cipher, termed “Enochian” — for es - pionage purposes, but, primarily, it was utilized by them to receive and use an Alien technology, so advanced as to be indistinguishable from magick, to learn such tech - niques as teleportation between planets and remote communication. The Enochian cipher led directly to a simpler successor cipher communicated to York Rite Royal Arch of Enoch Masons as a series of glyphs corresponding to the 26 letters of the standard English Alphabet, and in use until laid open. Around the middle of the 19th Century the Royal Arch of Enoch cipher having been exposed to public view by a writer named Malcolm Duncan, the aliens began the slow process of communicating the new cipher to various deep agents and human allies. Madame Blavatsky of the Theosophical Society and before that the Hermetic Brotherhood of Light seems to have known the code, taught her by her Masters, Paolos Metamon and Max Theon, probably themselves Ultraterrestrial Agents. She used them to encode the names of the human adepts and Ultraterrestrials she was in communication with."},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"Allen H. Greenfield 88 About a hundred years ago mass distribution of the “new” cipher was begun through the dictation of various alleged modernistic “Holy Books” which contained the encrypted cipher. Oahspe was dictated by an Ultraterrestrial in the 1890s. As late as the early 1900s it was still being transmitted by Max Theon and his wife Alma from their headquarters in Algeria under the name “Cosmic Philosophy” — distrib - uted in Georgia by the adept Peter Davidson. But our key communication came to Edward Alexander Crowley and his bride Rose Edith Kelly Crowley during their extended honeymoon in Cairo in the Spring of 1904. For one hour each day, from noon to 1 PM, a mysterious being calling itself “Aiwass” dictated The Book of the Law , a holy book for the new age then only begin - ning, which included repeated references to a cipher based in the number eleven. Crowley himself was unable to break the cipher, as the text itself predicted, but his student Charles Robert John Stansfeld Jones eventually cracked it. Crowley’s own efforts focused on a single page of the original manuscript with a mysterious line and strange mark. He overdrew a grid on this page, but never was able to find the Aiwass cipher as such. Following up on the work of Crowley and Jones, English occultists, notably Jake Stratton-Kent, Carol Smith and especially James Lees, worked out the code com - pletely in 1976. Following Crowley’s original grid overlay on the key page, they started with the letter “A” and, counting down eleven spaces, came to L, then W and so on until 26 numerical values for letters were obtained, in other words a complete English language cipher. I had long pondered the strange names for planets and beings in the contactee lore, and was the first person to apply this cipher to UFO communication cases. Once this was done, the entire UFO mystery fell readily into place; I had stumbled upon the cipher of the Ultraterrestrials for communication with their deep agents and human allies, and, once found, was able to intercept enough myself to predict UFO events, to explain the UFO mystery, to find the deep agents, and to be able to prove each of these claims beyond the shadow of a doubt. In short, I had solved the UFO mystery. In my 35 years in UFOlogy, the most intriguing question I have thus far run across anywhere is why the Earth has not been taken over by the various powerful groups of aliens that seem hostile —in specific, the Grays and Insectoid beings that have bases of operation all over the world, and, in the case of the Grays, have even entered into covert agreements with various Earthly governments. Some so-called experts will tell you that these forces have been checked by more benevolent visitors to our world, but all known groups of True Aliens are either fun - damentally neutral, or themselves “on the run” from Grays and the like, or, in truly advanced races of beings, have a strict policy of nonintervention in the affairs of other worlds. Other “experts” will tell you we HAVE BEEN taken over. Charles Fort pronounced the famous and frightening verdict in 1919; he said “I THINK WE’RE PROPER -"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"Secret Rituals of the Men In Black 89 TY.” and a number of modern researchers who have looked at the situation consider this to be so. Neither answer is in accord with the facts. It is true that benevolent ADVANCED visitors will not interfere; on their own worlds they have had similar experiences to that of the tragic contact between Europeans and Native Americans which destroyed the native cultures of this hemisphere, and also of the Roman Republic’s gradual conversion to a totalitarian Empire in the process of “helping” other nations with their internal affairs. It is also true that the Grays and their more advanced allies across galaxies and dimensions undreamed of have defeated and overcome many enlightened civiliza - tions; when contactee Woodrow Derenberger met the alien calling himself “Indrid Cold” the latter told him that he came from a country far weaker than ours; which is a kind of “coded message” to indicate to those who know the UFO mystery as not true mystery but rather history, that Cold and his cohorts from the planet he called Lanulus were themselves a conquered race, hiding among us. The truth lies in another direction; one that few writers - even writers of science fiction - have even guessed at, although the late Frank Herbert came very close in his Dune novels; and the early UFOnaut trance channeler Mark Probert came even closer; we have not been taken over, we are not property, not because aliens do not want our planet, nor because others have protected us, but because the dark forces from deep space are, quite simply, and for some mysterious reason, afraid of us Earth - lings. They are, in fact, frightened to death of us. This shows up in some of the lit - erature; the jealousy of the gods of genesis that having gained wisdom from the Tree of Knowledge, we might eat of the Tree of Life and thus become gods ourselves; the story of the Titan Prometheus bringing fire from heaven to humanity, for which the gods punished him in unimaginable ways; the Norse and Teutonic myths of very mortal “gods” preparing for cosmic combat against the Frost Giants and their allies — all these stories, in Ultraterrestrial terms, tell us of beings and forces HUMAN OR CLOSE TO HUMAN that have defied the conquerors of a thousand thousand worlds, and put them repeatedly to flight. Mark Probert’s communications were not with “aliens” in the true sense, but rather with an Assembly of Sixteen “Guardians” who have protected the Earth from ill influences for thousands of years. All of these “beings” —and please understand this — started out being as human as you or I. They are the Ascended or Hidden Masters of the Great Brotherhood of the Adepti; people who have become “super beings” and have turned their attentions to the guiding of our evolution to becoming what they themselves are. They do not lead us, nor govern us, nor “own” us. In a very real sense, THEY ARE US. Some of these shining individuals walk amongst us unseen, just as do agents of darker forces from far worlds. There are, I can tell you absolutely with unshakable certainty, representatives of both this Great Brotherhood here in this great hall tonight, and of their opposition. They took little interest in my work as long as I was a common UFO field investigator collecting samples of grass and interviewing"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"Allen H. Greenfield 90 Charlie Hickson or John Reeves and other contactees and abductees. But when I discovered that deeply placed aliens among us, and deep agents of Ultraterrestrial forces were using a secret cipher to communicate with their overlords — a cipher previously known only to Initiates and a few occultists as detailed in my book Secret Cipher of the UFOnauts , they have taken notice, indeed. Some of you here have an unasked question: How do I know all of this? I am not, emphatically not, a “contactee” or “channeler” in the usual sense of the term, and, under present circumstances, I COULD NOT be an abductee, but, having cracked the communication cipher in use by a host of alien groups and their human contacts since the middle 1800s at least, I have been able to penetrate some of their most cherished blinds and secrets, and show others with the patience to grasp the cipher involved and the techniques for applying it how to do the same — what the “mes - sages” REALLY mean, who fairly soon, but there is probably still time to get in on the action. There is a reason for this. The cipher employs no telepathy, no “high tech devices” and relies on several subtle but essentially primitive techniques, no more sophisti - cated than hand carried messages. There are good reasons for this. Some of you no doubt recall the recent case of the U.S. pilot shot down over Bosnia. He survived un - til rescued in part because he DID NOT use the radio he had with him except under extreme circumstances. Radios have limited life spans. They can also be intercepted. So, too, can telepathic Ultraterrestrial messages, and the kind of unimaginable tech - nology some aliens - and some humans - employ. With earlier ciphers, this method of communication has been in use on Earth for at least several thousand years. While I cannot decode all earlier ciphers, at least some of them follow the same general rules down through history."},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"Secret Rituals of the Men In Black 91 My favorite example is the classic of classics, the communication between the late contactee George Adamski and a being calling itself “Orthon” — a so-called “Blond Alien” who has shown up in many cases since. The entire case was superimposed on a science fiction story written earlier by Adamski and modified to fulfill certain needs, perhaps by the late occultist and UFOlogist George Hunt Williamson. The technique followed shows up in case after case after case. The alien names are usually strange words that refer to a planet, or being, or vehicle. The case is well publicized, and anyone reading the publicity and knowing the Secret Cipher of the UFOnauts could “decode” the strange names and story pattern, and find a secondary, more im - portant meaning. This particular case has alarm bells all over it; the name Adamski means, roughly, “Son of Adam” or “Son of Man”. The visitor has long blond hair, is male but androgynous, comes from the sky preaching a message of peace and love. Someone with the cipher would then key in on the name “ORTHON” and discover, immediately, that this was an important event, because the cipher value for ORTHON is the same as the cipher value for JESUS, and the story itself is a weird parody of the New Testament account. Adamski in later years was even reputed to have risen from the grave renewed, and then to have risen with other celestials into the heavens. But the key here, I think, was to call attention to the location of the sighting on the California-Arizona border. Orthon left behind mysterious footprints which contained a glyph of obvious interest only to initiates. One print clearly shows a fylfot cross emerging from a vesica pisces; in plain English, a swastika emerging from a time-space portal, indicating that this would continue to be a landing sight for a long time, and, indeed, adepts including the late Meade Layne would go to that area to meet landed aliens for years to come. That swastikas would show up in a case involving Adamski and Williamson are no surprise. Although that symbol has a long history before Nazi Germany, it was in the Nazi era that it developed its unfavorable reputation, and it was apparently the former American Nazi William Dudley Pelley who introduced the occultist Wil - liamson to the aspiring writer Adamski, shortly after Pelley was released from prison after WWII. Pelley and Williamson were both occultists, but Adamski was not. It is doubtful if the well-meaning Adamski ever had a clue as to who and what Orthon and for that matter Williamson were, and what they were doing. I have said that the Earth has never been taken over by Aliens, but a substantial core of what became the Nazi Party in Germany, which came closer to control of the world than many of us today realize, had been members of the Thule Group or the Vril Society before the Nazi rise to power. These groups were in contact with the Grays and some of their human allies in Tibet. In point of fact, Hitler, Alfred Rosenberg and Thule Group leader Dietrich Eckart began meeting as early as 1920. The Thule Group was in communication with Alien Beings who asserted a claim to the planet Earth, and offered Hitler and Company a piece of the action. But the real leader of this unholy human-alien alliance was General Karl Haushofer, a close as - sociate of Rudolph Hess, who effectively wrote Hitler’s Mein Kampf . Hess ultimately"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"Allen H. Greenfield 92 identified Haushofer as “the magician, the secret master” of the Nazi revolution. Hess, the last survivor of the Nazi leadership and last known member of the Thule Group, finally died at Spandau Prison at the age of 93, and under most mysterious circumstances, only a few years ago. The level of involvement between the inner Nazi cadre - particularly the Death’s Head SS and the Gray Aliens is profound. Their secret initiation called “The Stifling Air” actually involved contact with so-called “deep Aliens” who cannot breathe our atmosphere. In any case, the Aliens actually had no vested interest in the Nazis or any other group of humans, who they fear and despise. Their only purpose is to retard human evolution in any way they can, because an evolved humanity, they feel (rightly or wrongly), will one day not only defeat them on the Earth, but will unseat them among the very stars. So, among us are agents of dissension, of crackpot schemes and nightmarish ideas. They terrorize the unwary, try cutting deals with Earthly governments, and avoid those Guardians — that is humans already evolved into Higher Beings — who they are no match for. All that I have learned in UFOlogy, where I started out looking for “advanced be - ings from other planets” like everyone else — has taught me that we humans are, in potential, the most advanced, developed beings in the galaxy. The positive aliens are here not to help, but like the Magi in the Nativity Story, to witness the birth of The New Being. The Grays, insectoids and other vampiric nightmares from dying stars are here to suck out a little of the life energy that they themselves have so little of, and to delay the inevitable evolution of humanity triumphant. Mark Probert’s 16 Guard - ians are merely the first. We, as they tell us, and as intercepted cipher messages have told me and all with eyes to see, will someday be the Coming Guardians ourselves."},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"93 B IBLIOGRAPHY Anatomy of the Body of God by Frater Achad Book 31 by Frater Achad, edited by Allen Greenfield The Egyptian Revival by Frater Achad I.N.R.I. by Frater Achad QBL by Frater Achad VOUDON GNOSTIC WORKBOOK by Michael Bertiaux VRIL: The Power of the Coming Race by Bulwer Lytton L.
