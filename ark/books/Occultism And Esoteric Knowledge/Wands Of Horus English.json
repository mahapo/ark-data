And that is how it will remain until the mature gaze, contemplating the ruins of a lost civilisation, sees the world in the same way as it was seen by the ancient Hierophants. At that point, liberated, it will acknowledge the reality of what mankind still rejects, of what was for the Hierophants not a myth, not an abstract religious view of the world, but a guide for action. What are the Wands of Horus? Their roots go back into the depths of time. For the priests and pharaohs of Ancient Egypt the Wands of Horus — metal cylinders filled with various special materials — were a tool for “attainment”, allowing them to achieve a step by step evolution of their psychic, energy and, consequently, physical capacities, the development of which was a decisive factor in preparing to enter into “intercourse with the gods” through the pyramids. If certain conditions are observed and sessions conducted on a regular daily basis, the Wa nd s o f H o rus can not only correct, but also stimulate a person’s nervous, energy and immune systems, creating the preconditions for their improvement (1 ).This requires work founded on a precise understanding of what the Wands of Horus are and the principle by which they work, a knowledge of the cycles of activeness in the human energy system and a number of elements making up a complex approach, an essential part of which is interaction with natural sources of energy, such as trees, rivers, lakes, the sea and mountains. The Wands of Horus are also a means of prevention and tr eatment, providing the opportunity in certain disorders to correct particular deviations from the norm and noticeably improve a person’s state of health, since they inspire very deep-run ning physiological and energetic processes. It is important to stress that the knowledge of the Ancient Egyptians was founded not on mystic, astrological or esoteric (2 ) doctrines, but on a strict grasp of the principles on which the universe is founded. In other words, at the basis of the theore tical and spiritual constructs of the Ancient Egyptian initiates lay first and foremost Knowledge and not faith. The Wa nd s o f H oru s and, indeed, the knowledge of the Ancien ts in general is a very interesting and wide-reaching topic. Therefore, in or der to help readers to grasp the st ructure of principles invisible to the uninitiated eye and to draw closer to the sources of knowledge, the International Information Centre for UFO Research presents a publication intended to br ing to a wider public recent results obtained from the study of the legacy of Ancient Egypt. This brochure is the first work to shed some light on the mystery of why the pyramid complex at Giza in Egypt was constructed. Reading it you will find out not only about the principles that lay behind the idea of constructing the pyramids, but also abou t the connection between the Wands of Horus and the “Energy Source” located within the pyramid. It is th at connection that gives the Wands of Horus their miraculous properties and their harmonising effect on a person’s energy system and, as a consequence, on his or her general state of health. One of the sections is devoted to a description of the technology used to produce the Wands of Horus and the mechanism by which they operate. This will help the reader to understand how they are constructed, and how the pyramids and the cylinders work in a single complex, down to the finest details. You will learn some results of experiments conducted by Russian scientists to study the effect of the Wands of Horus on the human organism and the effect of the Pyramid on anim ate and inanimate objects."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"The Wands of Horus A Secret Recovered . 2 Third Edition - December 2001 A Secret Recovered Every time we return again to this world, we do not recall the past and, discovering the world anew, we live out our lives, leaving a track which we sha ll probably not remember when we come back again. Incarnation after incarnation we move through the dark labyrinths of life, almost by touch alone, trying to discover the sacred mean ing of that which has been covered over by the sands of history, trying to read the invisible message left us by past civilisations. But, inhabiting a different body, in a different age that imposes its new rhythm upon us, and basing ourselves on other values than those that prevailed thousands of years ago, we look into ourselves with de tachment in search of an answer to that which we did not comprehend in other lives. The gradual recovery of knowledge that was the property of previous civilisations, that to one extent or another determined the fate of peoples and the distinctive character of different ages, is a non-accidental characteristic of our own era, playing an important role in the process by which the material of human awareness is perfected. Knowledge — that most cherished of human goals — has at the same time been the cause of many troubles, especially when the level of morals and ethics was lower than that of knowledge. It is for that very reason that when knowledge was capable of becoming the cause of misfortunes, of those catastrophic processes which humans lacked the ability to control, events took place that removed that knowledge. As a consequence we today, so highly advanced as some believe, do not know what those who lived in the distant past knew. Until now the prevailing current of opinion has been that profound knowledge could not have existed in the distant past on principle, because th e emergence of scientific knowledge proceeds from the simple to the complex. It follows that mankind has not yet reached the peak of its intellectual ability. There is, however, a mass of puzzles thrown up by the study of the architectural monuments and writings of the distant past that forces us to think agai n about the level of knowledge the Ancients really possessed (3 ).In particular we are still challenged by the question of what the pyramids are, still trying to grasp their true purpose and th e reasons for their appearance. Pyramids, which have long troubled human imagination, were constructed in various parts of the globe, forming systems of their own, but we shall begin our account with an examination of the immense complex of the Great Pyramids located outside Giza in Egypt. Of itself the pyramid, its shape and configuration, is an extrem ely strange structure, while the curious phenomena that have been observed in the ch ambers of the pyramids suggest that some kind of energy processes are taking place there. Today our task is to try to understand the principles lying behind those processes. You have probably already heard that there are certa in places within the pyramid where foodstuffs of biological origin will keep for an indefinite length of time. There are also chambers where, if someone remains for an extended period, they experience an incredible sense of disquiet. However, there are also areas which engender fee lings of a different kind: positive, stimulating creative activity, and fostering intuition. If we look at the problem of the pyramid from the viewpoint of the simple, visually clear science of geometry, it turns out that we can come closer to an understanding of the object through describing it in a very simple manner. Suffice it to recall that in ancient times the laws of geometry were studied in very great depth and particular attention was devoted to the triangle with sides in the ratio 3:4:5. Today we are well aware that the hypotenuse of such a triangle is a fundamental concept relating directly to the question of harmony. And anything we say about harmony is associated first and foremost with sound. Sound is what human beings are i mmediately attuned to, irrespective of their cultural background, level of education or intelligence. In this context there are a number of curious facts that need to be pointed out. One is that when a baby comes into the world its first cry, no matter what its timbre or volume, has as a rule the frequency of"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"The Wands of Horus A Secret Recovered . 3 Third Edition - December 2001 A. Another is that those people who have “perfect pitch” relate other notes back to A. The sound of A is then a kind of yardstick frequency. It is also known that the average distance between the human eardrums is an exact fraction of the wavelength of A. The wavelength of A is 78 centimeters. Divide that by four and you get the distance in question. (4 ). We also know that frequencies are only resonant when the one wavelength is an exact multiple of the other. That means that nature has constructed the hum an hearing apparatus is su ch a way that it is tuned to the frequency of A, which plays a prime role in the musical scale. (A graphic depiction of the principle of resonance.) The pyramid is interesting for the fact that its shape contains not vertical planes as in ordinary architecture, but inclined ones instead. Therefore if you make a cross- section of a pyramid, you get a triangle, or two right-angled triangles back to back. And since you have a right-angled triangle, then you will recognise the position of the hypotenuse. What is the hypotenuse, though? In respect of a function or phenomenon the hypotenuse expresses the rate of a process (5 ), that is to say the frequency (which is characteristic for vibratory processes). The pyramids pose a host of puzzles, one of which is why they were built. We were taught to regard them as the tombs of pharaohs, but still today the actual burial-place has not been discovered in a single pyramid. It is just not there. The question then arises: for what purpose were such gigantic constructions put up, if not to glorify the pharaoh as God’s representative on Earth? Not so long ago, Japanese researchers tried to build a pyramid only 11 metres tall, using the construction methods employed (according to Herodot us) in Ancient Egypt a few thousand years ago, and they were unable to bring the four faces of the pyramid together to a single point. (6 ). The height of the tallest pyramid at Giza is 146 metres, yet it comes to a point. That naturally prompts the question: why build in this manner, if it is so difficult and laborious? In order to answer that question we should begin w ith an examination of the principles lying behind the idea of constructing the pyramids. The key to understanding the laws that formed the basis for the construction of the pyramids is provided by the tablets on which, according to legend, the Ancient Egyptians expounded their knowledge. At the beginning of the century Quibell’s expedition to Saqqara discovered the tomb of an Ancient Egyptian architect from which they extracted a set of wooden boards covered in carving. Judging by the number of niches in which the panels stood, there were originally eleven of them (7 ). The order in which the panels were placed in the tomb of Hesi-Ra follows what is known as the Lucas sequence. (8 ). They are the figures obtained from adding and subtracting the"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"The Wands of Horus A Secret Recovered . 4 Third Edition - December 2001 ordinal numbers that form the Golden Section sequen ce. The images presented on the panels follow the same pulsating rhythm or, as the Ancient Egyptians themselves said, the KA–BA rhythm. In the Ancient Egyptian dualistic conceptual system, BA (9 ) refers to the real, physical object or person; KA is what makes up our energy shell. From the state of the KA it is possible to determine precisely the psychological and physical condition of the person, which organs are damaged, and so on. In short, it is a particular energetic-informational structure in which everything is reflected. The panels in question have proved to be something unique. Several layers of information can be traced on them, providing the key to recognition of the fact that the Ancient Egyptians knew all about the Golden Section long before Pythagoras. Today we know from measurements that have been taken that the principl e of the Golden Section was used in the construction of all the great pyramids. Another question arises. It is not easy to produce a structure like a pyramid, you need to have the appropriate constructional technolo gy suited to the purpose, but beyond that its geometrical structure incorporates the irrational ratios of the Golden Section, which are mo re difficult than ordinary whole numbers. Why? It should be pointed out that the whole musical s cale, the whole sonic temperament, obeys the same law of the Golden Section. Remember what it says in the Gospel: “In the beginning was the Word” — and the word is sound (a wave process characterised by frequency). And if the word conveys meaning, then that means that the frequency , as a characteristic of the energy process should also have some kind of meaning. The one cannot exist without the other. That is a principle. The conclusion follows that the prin ciple of the Golden Section, upon which the great multitude of objects in the biological world are constructed, bears a very profound, fundamental meaning. And it is no coincidence that in the human being in particular the law of the Golden Section can be traced in some many different variations that one can only wonder that nature created us just that way. The bones of the fingers, three in number; three parts of the arm (the relationship of lengths) — elements of the Golden Section. The heart b eats in this rhythm and pushes blood into the aorta, leaving a portion in the ventricle. All of it the Golden Section. The rods and cones of the eye, the cochlea of the ear (t he ratio of the lengths of the spirals), the structure of the whole skeletal framework — examine the statistical averages an d it is all the Golden Section. Even the dynamics of the neural structures in certain mental states obey the same law. Can that really be mere chance or a peculiarity of mankind alone? No, the same principle governs the orbital periods of the planets in the Solar System , the musical scale is founded on it, the system of chemical elements and indeed everything connected with natu ral systems obeys that law. The wands held in the left hand of the priest who is depicted on the first main panel are show n in a ratio connected with the frequency of A. The standard value accepted for the pitch of A today is 440 Hz, but 441 Hz is more precise. It is astonishing that no-one particularly noticed that if you place the figures 441 after a decimal point, i.e. 0.441 , what you get is a function of the Golden Section. Knowing all that, we arrive at an interesting revelation. Not only do these panels explain the principle of using the Golden Section, they also present tools that are elementarily simple, yet work like a computer. Our arms themselves are already tools of the same kind as the “measuring instrument” depicted on the tablets. Calcul ations have shown that this wand is a tool with"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"The Wands of Horus A Secret Recovered . 5 Third Edition - December 2001 which it is possible to calculate any value of the Golden Section directly as a length, without using any complicated mathematical formulae, just manipulati ng the “magic wand”, adding on and taking away. You get the feeling that human beings were created to some kind of standard. It would be more correct, however, to say that human beings could not have formed differently for the simple reason that they appeared in an environment that imposes those parameters, and the values of the Golden Section bear a direct relation to what we call “harmonic resonance”. (See “Appendix 1” on page 47 ) A nything related to resonant phenomena must in the most general terms be connected with the functions of the Golden Section. Because nature works in the simplest, most economical, most effective, most colourful and most diverse manner — using the Golden Section. Today it is possible to say with complete certainty than the knowledge encoded on the Hesi-Ra panels formed the basis for the construction of the pyramids. It represents the missing link that was needed in order to be able to state that the pyramids were built on the level of exact science. It is very important that the ration between the dimensions of the two rods in the priest’s left hand is such that their product is 0.441, or the frequency of A [divided by a thousand]. The calculation is quite simple. The two rods measure 0.5 and 0.822 [units]. Multiplying those two values, 0.5 x 0.882 = 0.441. This panel shows a table with what Egyptologists tell us are sacrificial loaves on it. We have here a priest of Horus. In the “Sacred Triangle” Horus was char acterised by the hypotenuse, the harmonising element. To be a priest of Horus meant to be the Guardian of the Knowledge of Harmony. And harmony is the thing that embraces absolutely all spheres of act ivity and knowledge. This priest (who was also an architect) was the number one person in the Ancient Egyptian civilisation, so important that information about him was not distributed anywhere. He was a man of mystery. Hesi-Ra means “Marked Out by the Sun”. It would seem that what is on the table is not sacrificial loaves but some sort of tuning device set to the pitch of A. Confirmation of this is the fact that the dist ance between the table-top on which the device stands and the floor is precisely 0.441 of the corresponding standard length. The device stands on a base, and that base is equal to 441 . The measuring instruments used by the Ancient Egyptian architects were set using the tuning device. Hesi-Ra indicates this directly. Take a close look at the first panel. The priest depicted there holds two measuring instruments with one hand thus indicating that they are linked together, while his other, right, hand points to the tuning device thus emphasising the link between it and the measuring instruments. In other words, the measuring instruments are linked to the musical scale. It follows that, if measuring rods are harmonised with a tuning device set to the pitch of A, then to measure with those rods means to give the space in question resonant qualities founded on the musical scale. In other words, to introduce a system of linear-spatial parameters into a system of sonic harmony. (10 ).To build taking the laws just expounded into account means to create edifices that interact with the natural world, with its energy sources through the principle of harmonic resonance, that is through the mechanisms that lie at the foundation of the universe. Such an ap proach in its turn opens up the possibility of interacting with nature on a fundamentally different level. Now we turn to a fact that sheds light on one architectural decision that was founded on the principles expounded above and reveals some of the details in the pyramid builders’ conception."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"The Wands of Horus A Secret Recovered . 6 Third Edition - December 2001 In the Pyramid of Cheops there is a chamber, erroneously referred to by the majority of Egyptologists as the “Queen’s burial chamber”, whose situation in respect of the summit of the pyramid is connected with the tuning frequency. If we take the height of the whole pyram id as one unit, and measure down a distance of 0.882 — twice the frequency of A (or rather an octave higher), we find the chamber at exactly that point. But if we remember that the average human ear, indeed the whole structure of the human being, is attuned to the frequency of A, forming a kind of planetary field of this keynote signal, it emerges that the chamber within the pyramid is placed at a position attuned to the resonating frequency of that field . If, proceeding from that, we accept that the pyramid wo rks as a resonator, then we can begin to think of the purpose of pyramid as taking the form of a special kind of generator. Then the reason for the appearance of resonance characteristics and energy ph enomena at various points in the pyramid becomes clear. It follows that the pyramid structure can have wh at might be termed a corrective effect on human beings. Evidently the pyramid was intended to influence human psychological and physiological structure. And not of just one person, but of a large number. And the correction of a person’s psychological and physical qualities is bound up with his ethical standards, with harmonisation, because harmony divorced from ethical principle simply cannot exist. Are the pyramids working now? The pyramids are always working. They cannot fail to work. There is, however, the question of their activation. The periods when the pyramids are active an d the opportunities that they afford are connected with energy processes taking place in the universe. While they are re sonators, the pyramids are at the same time antennae of a kind, a system by which energy and information passes from one space to another. That, in turn, determines the constant use of the pyramids to deal with a wide range of tasks."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"The Wands of Horus The “Energy Source” The Wands of Horus & the Structures of Deep Meditation . 7 Third Edition - December 2001 The “Energy Source” The Wands of Horus & the Structures of Deep Meditation For long millennia the great pyramids preserved the mystery of a “secret room” containing, according to legend, either secrets of a special kind or some sort of knowledge that would give the finder power over the world. Men have been searching fo r that knowledge for many centuries already. They looked for it within the twin-humped rock on which the body of the pyramid rests (11 ).They also looked for beneath the pyramid. But the room is not where they were looking but in the upper part of the pyramid, at a point defined by the ratio 0.118:0.882 . That chamber contains the “Energy Source” which the Ancient Egyptians inherited from the people of Atlantis who had come to northern Africa long before the heyday of Egyptian civilisation.(See “Appendix 2” on page 48 ). This source takes the form of a cylinder within whic h is a special crystal with a lattice structure close in parameters to that of quartz crystals. (12 ). Almost all the most astonishing phenomena observed in and around the pyramid are connected with the presence of this very device. (13 ). The sense of creating and using the “Energy Source” lies in its capacity to affect the structure of time and space in the vicinity of its location. The shape of the pyramid serves to intens ify this effect and disperse s the incoming energy in the area of the pyramid. Besides that, though, th e “Energy Source” affects human psychological and physical structure. Pick up any book about Ancient Egyptian culture and take a close look at the statues of the pharaohs: you will see that they are all clasping cylinder-like objects in their hands. The “Energy Source” that was constructed in the proportions of the Golden Section entered into resonant interaction with the cylinders held in the hands because they too were created in the proportions of the Golden Section. (14 ). Apart from that, however, both these devices were constructed, one might say, in a single image and likeness — as a kind of miniature model of certain energy processes that arise cyclically in the biosphere and the space around a human being. That, in turn, determines yet another level of interaction between them. Those cylinders, with which the pharaohs never parted throughout their lives, were harmonisers of the two basic flows of energy which the Ancient Egyptians called BA and KA, corresponding to Yin and Yang in the Oriental tradition. For the Ancient Egyptians BA and KA were the two component elements of the human entity, the two sources of vital energy. While they are interacting properly, the vital functions of the organism are maintained and the person lives without any particular problems. To regulate the energy balance in the body the Ancient Egyptians used “Wands of Horus” — cylinders with various contents."},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"The Wands of Horus The “Energy Source” The Wands of Horus & the Structures of Deep Meditation . 8 Third Edition - December 2001 This scu lptural group symbolically reflects this phenomenon. The KA cylinder is in the right hand of the god Heru (Horus). (15 ). The male figure symbolises the flow of Yang energy (the male principle). The deity is an embodiment of the energy plane. The Yin cylinder is in the left hand of the goddess Aset (Isis), who represents the female principle, that is to say the flow of BA energy. In the centre is Asar (Osiris) with two energy-giving hands directed towards him. (16 ).The use of these cylinders to a considerable extent helped the pharaoh (or other user) to perfect his nervous, energetic and (as a co nsequence) immune systems, to improve his health and physical condition, since the cylinders had a beneficial effect on those areas. (17 ). The correct and systematic use of the cylinders enabled the phar aoh or priestly user to prepare himself for “Intercourse with the Gods”. The cylinder for the right hand was made from copper and associated with the sun (Yang). The cylinder for the left hand was made from zinc and associated with the moon (Yin). Placed with in the cylinders were minerals that were changed as the pharao h made advances in the process of self-perfectio n. The filling in the initial phase was a special kind of white sand. Cylinders containing white sand have a positive effect on a person’s energy channels, activating them. As the transformational processes progressed, large-grained quartzite was added to the cylinders. This photograph, taken in the Metropolitan Museum, New York, in the autumn of 1999 shows the cylinders of Pharaoh Pepi II To reinforce the properties of the cylinders gold was added to the copper in the appropriate proportion, on account of which the “Sun Cylinder” was also called the Gold Cylinder. Silver was added to the “Moon Cylinder”, which was accordingly called the Silver Cylinder. These cylinders were produced in the proportions of the Golden Section, while their dimensions were determined on the basis of the state of the given person’s energy system and health, and the tasks being pursued. To give an example, in the event of disharmony where the BA or Yin type of energy was clearly dominant, to restore balance and harmony the Ancient Egyptians used only the copper Yang cylinder, which was held in the right hand. These two sculptures depict a situation of this kind. The men represented here evidently had problems connected with a imbalance, an excess of Yin energy (the female principle), which in males can lead, for example, to metabolic disorders, reduced sexual activity and a number of other fairly serious disorders. For proper harmonisation it is better to use both cylinders at the same time, but the Yang one should be larger than the Yin one, making it possible to brin g the Yang up to the necessary level. Subsequent use of identical cylinders makes it possible to harmonise the two flows of energy. If a person has an excess of Yang, which is quite often the case with women in particular (leading possibly to certain hormonal disturbances), then the use of the cylinders (a larger"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"The Wands of Horus The “Energy Source” The Wands of Horus & the Structures of Deep Meditation . 9 Third Edition - December 2001 Yin and a smaller Yang) produces an evening-out, afte r which identically sized cylinders should be used for subsequent harmonisation. But that is not all. A pharaoh wears a rather strange elongated head-dress that is customarily taken to be a crown. This head-dress is actually a special concentrator, focused on the hypophysis and the hypothalamus — more precisely on their energetic projections, and tuned to the pyramid and the “energy source” within it. (See “Appendix 3” on page 50 ) The whole complex — the energy source within the pyramid, the cylinders held in the hands, (18 ) and th e concentrator (on the pharaoh’s head) — is directly connected on certain days (cycles) of the year with the pyramids and their effect.. The pyramid, being simultaneously both antenna and resonator, is a retransmitter of certain energy flows arising from processes taking place in the cosmos, flows that are in turn focused on the “Energy Source” inside the pyramid (19 ). The influence of this complex and its correct interaction with human consciousness produced the effect of “Intercourse with the Gods”. The immense pyramid complex at Giza was, in essence, a “ Deep Meditation Structure ” enabling the pharaoh or priest to make contact with the Noosphere (20 ), the Earth’s informational systems, and on occasion... even with representatives of other planetary systems. (See “Appendix 4” on page 52 ) This picture, familiar from American banknotes, is a symbol of the act of “Intercourse with th e Gods” achieved with the aid of the pyramid, a symbol that has come down to us through the centuries. The eye is in the upper part of the pyramid, the place where the “energy source” is located and in this case symbolises the “Holy Spirit” with which the pharaoh or priest entered into contact when the “Source” was activated.(See “Appendix 5” on page 54 ) Today it is well known that pe ople who “make contact” with the Noosphere, or informational field, very often see this “eye”. The “All-Seeing Eye” is a symbol that was given to mankind from above and is not a human invention. The eye was seen by pharaohs and priests during certain phases of cult rituals. That is why the symbol occurs in many hermetic knowledge systems and religions. (21 ),. The outlines of phenomena whose secret has been preserved for millennia emerge from the mists of time, and we begin to grasp the hidden meaning of the legacy handed down to us and the true reasons for the building of the pyramids. The pharaoh obtained information through “Intercourse with the Gods”, or, as we might say today, “close encounters”. It was this fact, coupled with longevity, that placed the pharaoh in an exceptional position, where he was considered to be “God’s representative on Earth”. However, the role of the hierophant-priests in all this seems to have been something absolutely unique. Although he had become God’s representative on Earth, the pharaoh still remained in a certain degree of ignorance. The pharaoh evidently did not know what the hieropha nts knew. Here is the evidence of that. Hesi-Ra, mentioned earlier, was the leader of “the Ten of the South”, that is to say the eleventh in the most senior group of hierophant priests. Hesi-Ra’s tomb contained eleven panels, one of which, the “title-page”, was called dekanos (“chief of ten”). That means that eleven fields of depiction are presented on the outer faces, and the same number on the reverse — where there a diagrams that would appear to explain the use of the technology of the “Canon” (22 ) in the compositional structure of this or that picture. Now let us recall... Ancient Egypt’s main propositions (principles) abou t the structure of the universe are expounded in twenty-two arcana, which were grouped in two blocks of eleven. The first block formulated basic ideas about the world. The number 11 was a magic one (num ber of power), because the first element of the"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"The Wands of Horus The “Energy Source” The Wands of Horus & the Structures of Deep Meditation . 10 Third Edition - December 2001 second stage (tier) of the decimal system is the first (pattern-setting) step of the following “two-digit layer”. At the same time it is the chief, the “hierarc h” of the preceding group of ten. So, while Hesi-Ra was the eleventh, that is the hierarch of the supr eme Ten (of the South), concluding and setting the pattern, the pharaoh was the twelfth and did not belong to the group. Here is a text (1) written in praise of some outstanding scribes: Is the like of Jedefhor to be found anywhere? Is there anyone to compare with Imhotep? There is none among us like Nefri And Hetti is the foremost of all... From text 1, then, it emerges that there was in Ancient Egypt someone named Hetti ( hat in translation from Coptic can be read as “receptacle of reason”). Among the other names mentioned in the text, Imhotep is a historically attested figure, so is Jedefhor. Hetti is not an invented character either. But why was he in particular singled out for such great praise? In order to understand what it meant to be greater than Imhotep, for one, let us turn to another specific text (2): The vizier of the Pharaoh of Lower Egypt, first after the Pharaoh of Upper Egypt, steward of the great chamber, honoured citizen, great priest of Heliopolis, Imhotep, the builder and sculptor... So we see that the pharaoh alone was superior to Imhotep. The same source contains a text (3) giving evidence of the social status of Hesi-Ra: Hesi-Ra, head of Destiuts and head of Buto head of the physicians, scribe of the Pharaoh, confidant of the Pharaoh, priest of Horus, chief architect of the Pharaoh, Supreme head of the Ten of the South and carver... Comparing the administrative functions of these two re presentatives of the priestly caste we find that Imhotep was only a builder — one who carried out co nstruction work, while Hesi-Ra was chief architect of the Pharaoh — the man to whom the pharaoh entrusted the designing. In Ancient Egypt, of course, they did not make the strong distinction we do to day between the architect-designer and the contractor- builder; both functions were combin ed in the same person. Yet even if we accept that Imhotep was an architect, Hesi-Ra is styled chief architect of the Pharaoh — the highest of the high. In this titular respect his status in the sphere of architecture was certainly superior to Imhotep’s. Yet, let us not forget, that popular hearsay reckoned that it was Imhotep who wo rked out the Canon. It follows that the common people knew about Imhotep, while no rumours circul ated about the person of Hesi-Ra. This indicates that either Hesi-Ra occupied a lesser position in the hierarchy or, on the contrary, was so important a figure that his name and, most importantly, his powers were kept secret. The reason may have lain in Hesi-Ra’s extensive erudition in the arcane sciences, from which derived above all the knowledge of harmony that embraced all spheres of activity. In that case, though, we require convincing evidence that Hesi-Ra was entrusted with functions indicating involvement with that field. And we do have them. In text 3 above, Hesi-Ra is called a priest of Horus. At first sight this is a fairly humble position, but if we recall that Horus was the symbol of harmony (b ecause in the sacred 3:4:5 triangle the sides forming the right-angle were given the names of Isis and Osiris, the parents of Horus, while the name of Horus designated the hypotenuse, the parameter for harmon ious connection between the parents), the social standing of Hesi-Ra immediately becomes several orders higher than the priestly rank of Imhotep: to be a priest of Horus meant to act a guardian of the kn owledge of harmony. Notable in this context is the reference to Hesi-Ra as “head of the physicians”. Th e thing is that knowledge of the laws of harmony extended above all to an understanding of the struct ure of the human organism (the principle of BA and KA), on account of which healing was conducted on th e basis of knowledge encoded in the canon. This method was widely practised in both East and West. Indications of this kind can also be found in Ancient Indian treatises. Hesi-Ra could be the head of physicians only if he was involved in compiling the Canon, or was acquainted with its subtlest nuances. We should assume therefore that Hesi-Ra was not only the nominal head of physicians, but a master of the methodology of healing, since he was sufficiently well-versed in the “t echnology” of the Canon. The ar chitect’s exceptional intellectual"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"The Wands of Horus The “Energy Source” The Wands of Horus & the Structures of Deep Meditation . 11 Third Edition - December 2001 abilities were evidently the reason for his appointment as “scribe of the Pharaoh” — the monarch’s thoughts had to be set down not verbatim, but with deep understanding, and corrections if required. (Just think what it meant “to set down the thoughts of the Pharaoh”. It is more than possible that Hesi-Ra was not only the person who prepared the pharaoh and brou ght him to the state in which “Intercourse with the Gods” became possible, but also the interpreter of the information that th e pharaoh received during such acts. Today we are well aware that the information received by pe ople during “close encounters” is often contradictory and requires car eful analysis and interpretation.) The modest title “confidant of the Pharaoh” suggests that Hesi-Ra fulfilled the role of privy counsellor. One would imagine that there was no higher social rung in Ancient Egypt th an that occupied by Hesi-Ra. Who then should have been entrusted with the design of the first large-scale pyramid (the Pyramid of Zoser) — Imhotep or Hesi-Ra? After all, it emerges quite unequivocally from the service records of the two high-ranking figures that Imhotep was allotted executive functions, while Hesi-Ra, the scholar-thinker, was among those engaged in prediction. In addition to which, he was head of the hierophants. (Remember that hierophant-priest means “one knowing destiny” or “foreseeing the future”.) (23 ) That means that if Imhotep was “first after the Pharaoh”, Hesi-Ra ranked above the pharaoh, because “kings do not make the rules fo r grammarians”. That is why Imhotep was only a builder and Hesi-Ra chief architect of the Pharaoh . That means that at the time of Pharaoh Zoser there was a man superior to the Pharaoh himself but in formation about him was not spread about “in the world” in order to preserve the secret knowledge of which Hesi-Ra had a perfect mastery. These circumstances allow us to present a sufficiently sound argument that a man named Hetti (“the foremost of all”) was elevated to the status of a deity Ra (Hesi-Ra) for working out the aesthetic (and therefore also ecological) pr inciples of the Canon, reflecting the harmonious foundations of the universe. The actual idea of using the Golden Section in architecture today, together with the creation of “complexes of pyramidal energy struct ures”, is the chief element in so lving the problems of the ecology of housing, the ecology of the mental environment, an d in the process of coming to an understanding of the world. This is the very key issue, recognition and implementation of which might become the start of our ascent to the next rung of evolution. For this reason a whole section of this brochure should be devoted to it. For the moment, however, we shall only indicate what the pyramid is in principle. The pyramid is: a) a powerful cosmic antenna; b) a model in stone of the energy structure of the human being and of the universe, using the latter’s energy mechanism; c) a very powerful generator of cosmic energies operating on various planes Pyramidal energy structures, whose positioning should be decided with reference to the energy qualities of the location (), open up the following possibilities: 1. Tapping into natural flows of cosmic energy, the organisation and stimulation of evolutionary processes in the biosphere and in human consciousness. 2. The reorganisation and correction of the human energetic structure, making it possible to stimulate internal energetic, bio-physical and physiological processes, which in turn provide the opportunity to discover and activate the inner resources of the human psyche, increasing psychic potential. 3. A positive influence on the immune and nervous systems, leading to their improvement. (24 ) 4. An improvement of mankind’s energo-ecological environment, an in crease and improvement of the energy state at the pyramid’s location and, as a consequence of the spread of pyramidal structures throughout the world, a reorganisatio n of the planet’s energy structure within the next 10–15 years. Pyramidal Energy Structures (25 )may play a decisive role in the fa te of the new generation, changing their level of awareness. Incidentally, any architectural stru cture founded on the principles of the Golden Section will possess the same qualities as the pyramids. Therefore, if we start to use the principles in designing and building"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"The Wands of Horus The “Energy Source” The Wands of Horus & the Structures of Deep Meditation . 12 Third Edition - December 2001 houses, our dwellings will have the same effect on us as the pyramids, stimulating our creative activities and positively influencing our organism and consciousness. Throughout the course of history, mankind has constantly striven to implement one idea or another, founded on the conceptual and moral le vel of the era, and, as a rule, dict ated by the personal interests of those who advocated the idea. To be more exact, that facet, that force within mankind that was formed by human weakness, the yearning for power and material benefits, realised itself through mankind. But there is pure knowledge, and there is that which was do ne in response to the needs of those living at the time. Therefore the pyramids were different depending on the ideas that were invested in them and the goals being pursued. The actual idea of the pyramid, its essence, is a cosmic phenomenon, but human weakness and self- seeking forced people to use the pyramids for pers onal ends and not those of all mankind. Many thousand years of human history have passed, but the same applies today, setting the tone for the actions of the majority of people. And even the great spirit ual discoveries of the present day do not change man for the better. The paradoxical thing about man is that for all his professed striving to create a bright future for the whole of humanity, he for some strange reason uses knowledge that is the property of all for his personal ends. That is precisely the mani festation of that very force which through human weaknesses, placing personal interests before those of everyone, rules the world. Yet there is the path of increasing understanding and it cannot be a path for the select few. Humanity will take its final step in its evolutionary ascent as a single organism. Everybody together. And if only a single person is not ready for that step, then we will not be able to take it. We will have to wait for the last one, and then we will all move on. And there is no end to that journey."},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"The Wands of Horus A brief historical commentary about BA & KA . 13 Third Edition - December 2001 A brief historical commentary about BA & KA As has already been stated, for the Ancient Egyptians BA and KA were component elements of the human being. Later (ro ughly in the 4 th century b.c.), as a result of an inco rrect interpretation of the term, the Ancient Greeks would begin to associat e BA with the soul. Although to some extent it is possible to picture it in that way, the BA is rather one of the components of the soul. In the Old Kingdom period possession of BA and KA was an attribute of pharaohs and gods alone. This is re flected in the “Pyramid Texts”. The god Ra, for example, had 14 KAs. BA and KA were conceived as an embodiment of the power and might of the Egyptian rulers and deities. In the Middle and New Kingdoms, as is reflected in the “sarcophagus texts” and the Book of the Dead, (26 ) BA and KA were considered to be embodiments of the life-force of all people while they lived and to continue to exist after death. According to Ancient Egyptian beliefs, the BA dwelt in the tomb together with the deceased person, performing all his or her physical functions. The KA was not only the life-force, but also a twin, an “alter- ego” inseparable from a person in both life and death. The hierophant-priests knew rather more about these two hypostases of the human being... BA and KA are two energy flows, two principles, opposite and unified, different and homogenous at the same time. In constant association and interaction within the person, BA and KA are the two sources of vital energy. While they are interacting, the organism’s vital functions are supported and a person exists without especial problems. (28 ). The merging of BA and KA, their interaction and evolution generates the AKH. The AKH (29 ) is the intermediary between God and people or a lesser deity capable of interpreting the messages of the gods. In point of fact, the AKH is something more than a person, but not, of course, a god. It is a human being with the ability to espy the future at certain moments and to predict it. One such person, capable of espying the future at particular moments was Michel Nostradamus. Despite the fact that he lived a couple of millennia after the decline of the Egyptian civilisation, Nostradamus nonetheless had something in common with the priests of Ancient Egypt. Surviving papyruses inform us that the priests performed particular calculations in order to predict the future. Those calculations were based on the determ ination of cyclical processes that have a negative effect on everything animate and inanimate found on our planet. Precise calcu lation could indicate not only the most likely period for possible natural cat aclysms connected with processes taking place in the cosmos, but also determine favourable or unfavourable periods for the taking of state or political decisions of one kind or another (See The Secret Method of Hermes Trismegistos for All Undertakings, at the end of “Appendix 5” on page 54 . This knowledge that at one time was complete b ecame lost over the centuries. What survived was wrapped in a veil of mystery and remained the proper ty of a very narrow circle of people. Fragmentary information about the cyclical processes was later available only to a few initiates, one of which was the sixteenth-century Frenchman. This is indicated by the astonishing unanimity between Nostradamus and the Ancient Egyptian hierophants with regard to the spread of this knowledge to a wider public. For a definite reason neither the one nor the others desired that their prophecies in th eir original form should become available to a wide circle of people. Nostradamus encoded the prophecies given in his Centuries , sharing the same point of view as the hierophants who in their time had encoded their knowledge on the Hesi-Ra panels. To be able to read, understand and appreciate the knowledg e recorded in a special language (code) based on the principles that lie behind the knowledge itself, means to master that knowledge and to attain a level where consciously infl uencing the course of historical events becomes a possibility."},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"The Wands of Horus A brief historical commentary about BA & KA . 14 Third Edition - December 2001 Many generations of scholars tried to discover how the prophecies recorded by Nostradamus were encoded, yet the solution, which proved to be quite simple, was there on ever page. If you open a copy of the Centuries , you will see that the text consists of quatrains — verses of four lines each. And the key to the code is the figure 4. It is absolutely obvious that Nostradamus knew about the “four-year cycles” that determine not only the stages in the evolution of human society, but also a whole range of events that take place in the solar system. From that knowledge of the cyclical nature of processes, Nostradamus states directly: “I reckon that in the future roughly the same number of events should take place as in the centuries th at have passed.” Now let us examine what he meant, taki ng as an example the history of Russia over the past century: 1901 , add on four years gives 1905 , and continuing 1909 , 1913 , 1917 , 1921 , 1925 , 1929 , 1933 , 1937 , 1941 , 1945 , 1949 , 1953 , 1957 , 1961 , 1965 , 1969 , 1973 , 1977 , 1981 , 1985 , 1989 , 1993 , 1997 , ... (See “Appendix 6” on page 61 ) Anyone with a knowledge of history will immediately notice that almost all the above dates are connected to very important milestones in the destiny of Russia. It should be stated at once that this scal e applies not only to Russia. Therefore as we return to Nostradamus’s quatrains which speak of pairs of events sometimes considerably separated from each other in time we should understand that he refers to events marking the beginning or end of a four-year cycle, or rather a twelve- (4×3) or thirty-six-year ((4×3)×3 ) cycle. While in the four-year cycle dates may come up that do not correspond to any epoch-making events, the twelve- and thirty-six-year cycles are always ma rked by such events. And so, when examining the prophecies of Nostradamus, we should base our calculations on the latter cycles. Today, knowing what has already taken place in the century drawing to a clos e, we can predict with a very high degree of probability the years which will be marked by the most significant events in the future: 2001 , 2005 , 2009 , 2013 , 2017 , 2021 , 2025 and so on It should be stressed that more than once Nost radamus himself directed attention to the number 4 and even in his will he gave instructions for his coffin to be surrounded by four one- livre candles, two on each side. One gets the impression that he wanted mankind to recognise this pattern for itself — and having recognised it to try, by damping down the tensions that arise, to construct relationships with each other and with the surrounding world in a positive manner with the four-year cycle in mind so that when we reached the year 1999 we would avoid the start of the 27-year war that Nostradamus foresaw. Already today it is evident that the conditions that had come together by the autumn of 1997 happily will not lead to the outbreak of the prolonged war he forecast. Yet, with the continuation of the four-year cycle in the next century in mind, we cannot afford to relax sin ce there are several dates ahead to which the fateful event might shift. Knowing the special significance of the thirty-six-year cycle and also the dynamic development of a positive awareness in mankind, we can say with near certainty that if the war does not begin by 2025, then, having passed through the critical phase, it will not begin at all. Increased activity of masses of people and the ra dical events that sometimes occur in society are directly connected with surges in solar activity that are in turn gov erned by the four-year cycle. For reasons of a cosmic nature precisely once every fo ur years Venus, moving strictly according to its “timetable”, suddenly slows down, while Mars at that moment accelerates. At that same point in time Janus and Epimetheus, two moons of Saturn, change their orbits, and here on Earth a new El Niño current appears in the Pacific. The appearance of that current is caused by chan ges in the Earth’s electromagnetic field due to a powerful outside influence. Those changes in turn are the cause not only of major natural disasters, but also of almost all air crashes an d other technical accident s since navigation systems and other electronic safety devices are to a certain extent depe ndent on the Earth’s electromagnetic field. The year 1997 saw the end of one four-year cycle an d the beginning of another. Take a look at the statistics, and you will see a surge of air crashes and natural disasters of different kinds took place in the countries of the Pacific basin between autumn 1997 and autumn 1998. It is important to stress that changes in the Earth’s electromagnetic field always have had and continue to have a negative effect on"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"The Wands of Horus A brief historical commentary about BA & KA . 15 Third Edition - December 2001 the health and immune systems of humans and animals. Despite the fact that th e peak of the negative phase of the current cycle has already passed, it is quite possible that in the near future we may hear of the appearance of some new disease in animals. We should note that under certain circumstances an increased intensity in the Earth’s electromagnetic field may lead to the ap pearance of immuno-deficit disorders in animals that will be passed on to humans. (See Appendix 6 ‘Part 2” on page 64 ) It is not pleasant to have to make gloomy predictions, but the four-year cycles are a reality of which the Ancients were aware. Suffice it to recall that an Ancient Egyptian calendar cycle lasted 1460 days. Divide 1460 by 365 and you get exactly four. In other words the Ancient Egyptians thought and measured their lives in four-year cycles. It was partly for this reason too that the Ancients built astronomical observatories with a degree of precision that is surprising even in our own time. By watching and calculating the phases of the moon, the Sun and the other planets, the Ancients worked out the cycles an d certain natural factors that are superimposed on them, predicting the possible future in order to prepare for it; using the positive phases of the cycle to attain particular goals or, by anticipating the nagative phases, reducing the potential for problems to a minimum. Taking account of the dangerous phases of the fou r-year cycles and their negative effect on the human immune system, to harmonise the BA and KA an d maintain the appropriate energy balance in the organism necessary for self-perfection, the Anci ent Egyptians used a whole set of measures, an invariable part of which were the “Wands of Horus” or cylinders with various fillings. Influenced by the biological field of the person holding them, these cylin ders activate the energy centres located in the pa lms and directly connected with the en ergy centres of the head, attuning themselves to the individual. They create an energy “cocoon” around the body, setting a particular biorhythm that corrects the person’s en ergy shell and beneficially influen ces the state of his or her health and immune system."},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"The Wands of Horus The Use of the Wands of Horus in Medicine & Everyday Life . 16 Third Edition - December 2001 The Use of the Wands of Horus in Medicine & Everyday Life Cylinders with the correct filling have an astonishing quality — they attune themselves to a person. They adjust to the rhythm that the organism needs at a particular time of the day or night. The cylinders can be used morning, noon, or night — whenever yo u like. They tune into the organism, to the energy channel that is open, and work with it. There is no time limit for a session with the cylinders. Consultation with a specialist will help you to chose the right dimensions and fillings, based on your physical data. The size of the cylinders can vary depe nding on the aim you have in mind, or the disease you want to tackle. Cylinders 146mm long were intended to work in conjunction with the Pyramid of Cheops and are connected to its effect. If, however, you need to stop some negative process in the organism and a powerful impulse is needed, then larger cylinders can be used. The cylinders are not a panacea for all illnesses, since their purpose is somewhat different. Nevertheless, it is worth stressing once again that the greater part of our illnesses begin with disharmony between two fundamental flows of energy — the BA and KA or Yin and Yang. Daily work with the cylinders ( for no less than two hours ) has a beneficial effect in cases of: ■ over-agitation and nervous disorders ■ problems with arterial pressure ■ vegeto-vascular disorders ■ cardio-vascular diseases ■ neurotrophic disorders ■ excretory diseases They also: ■ normalise the functioning of the heart in cases of arrhythmia and neuroses ■ improve circulatory processes, with a beneficial effect on blood vessels ■ ease pain in the joints in cases of arthritis and gout ■ help in cases of insomnia, act to relieve stress and help prevent atherosclerosis ■ if used systematically, lower the blood-cholesterol level Independent studies of the effect of the cylinders were carried out in the clinical bio-physics laboratory of the Dzhanelidze First Aid Scientific Research Institute in St Petersburg. Data from points reflecting the condition of the internal organs was displayed on a computer screen. The information was gathered from the bio-active zones of the palm using one of the usual diagnostic methods. Three bands were shown on the screen: green (normal state of the organs), red and blue (deviations from the norm). Naturally we all present a scattered picture with some points in the green zone and others outside, indicating some abnormality in the organism. After a few minutes holding the cylinders a minor miracle took place: the points began to creep into the green zone! The researcher s concluded that the influence of the cylinders brought the organism to a harmonised state in which it was much easier for it to deal with its troubles. Professor Dulnev of the Institute of Precise Mechanics and Optics, who, like the doctors, studied the effect of the cylinders using special apparatus, ascertained an increase in flows of h eat from the surface of the skin. This fact points to the operation of extremely subtle types (flows) of energy unknown to us. It is these that the cylinders “read”, entering into resonance with them."},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"The Wands of Horus The Use of the Wands of Horus in Medicine & Everyday Life . 17 Third Edition - December 2001 The effectiveness of the Wands of Horus can also be increased by using them in conjunction with miniature pyramidal energy structures (pyramids) made of wood. Such a pyramid fulfils in part the function o f a structure focusing the energy flows on the hypothalamus and the hypophysis (the 6 th and 7 th chakras) and the pancreas (3 rd chakra), two highly important elements of the endocr inal system. Work with such a complex strengthens the immune system. Such pyramids will be individually tailored since when calculating their dimensions the distance from the tip of the spine to a point between the eyebrows (the th ird eye) needs to be taken into account.(See “Appendix 1” on page 47 ) An experiment with the use of a therapeutic pyramid carried out at a district polyclinic in the town of Chug uyev in Kharkov region (Ukraine), showed that fifteen minutes spent in the pyramid removed stress, cured a headache and insomnia, normalised blood pressure, and increased a person’s creative activity."},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"The Wands of Horus Different Types of Wands of Horus . 18 Third Edition - December 2001 Different Types of Wands of Horus Overview As has already been stated, the cylinders can contain various fillings which in turn determines certain difference in their properties. At the start you should use cylinders with two types of filling. This is due to the general unpreparedness and unsatisfactory state of the ener gy system in the majority of people, something reflected in the illnesses that dog us. Therefore in the initial, preparatory phase to improve the general state of the body’s energy system and taking into account the most frequently occurring problems, we suggest cylinders with a filling of carbon and ferro-magnetic material (30 ) and others with a quartz filling (31 ). Following Ancient Egyptian tradition we shall refer to the cylinders as “Wands of Horus”. The table below indicates some basic differences that should be considered when selecting the type of cylinders. Both types of cylinder are effective for ■ Prevention of atherosclerosis ■ Diseases connected with poor circula tion (including certain forms of impotence) ■ Possible relief in cases of spasms in the alimentary canal; some relief in cases of arthritis and back pain (osteochondrosis and radiculitis) without elimination of the causes Both types of cylinders have a positive influen ce on blood vessels and the cardio-vascular system, but their effects vary. The effect of the cylinders filled with carbon and ferro-magnetic material is strong and forceful, an impulse capable of shifting an established problem. Those suffering from low blood pressure should be careful when using this type of cylinder as they lower blood-pressure. Coupled with low atmospheric pressure use by those with such a condition may lead to a circulatory collapse with all the consequences. On the other hand, for those with high blood-pressure, the cylinders filled with carbon and ferro- magnetic material may be an invaluable aid. The cylinders filled with quartz crystals have other properties. They are very good for guarding against cardio-vascular diseases, nervous depres sions and many other illnesses, but may prove inadequate against such conditions in the acute phase. It would not be correct to view the cylinders only as a treatment for one disease or another. The cylinders are above all a prophylactic device providin g the opportunity in certain diseases to correct deviations from the norm and thus prompt a significant improvement in your condition. First and foremost, though, the cylinders are a tool for “attainment”, allowing you to achieve a step- by-step evolution of your energy potential and, as a consequence, of your psychic capacities. The development of such psychic potential opens up whole new horizons of which the contemporary human being has virtually no conception. This is such an important and delicate subject that discussion Table 1: Different Types of Wands of Horus Wands of Horus Kont (carbon–ferro-magnetic filling) Wands of Horus Quartz (quartz filling) i Heart pain in cases of stenocardia (pain radiating to the shoulder and upper arm, numbness and heaviness in the arms, pain under the left shoulder-blade) Heart pain.

Types of Wands & Their Fillings In Ancient Egypt the Wa nd s o f H o ru s were filled with quartz crystals of differing sizes. The size of the crystals depending on the task they were seeking to accomplish, the state of the health and energy system of the user. In the initial phase fine-grain quartzites (a special white sand) were used. Cylinders containing white sand have a positive effect on a person’s energy channels, activ ating them. Then the Ancients used medium- and large-grained quartzites, raising their energy systems to a higher level of potential. We shall call this type of cylinder Wands of Horus Quartz The following variety of Wands of Horus contained monocrystalline quartz. This type of cylinder was intended for priestly healers. The energy “coco on” created by this type can have a powerful harmonising effect on the patient, at one and th e same time implementing and relaying a signal originating in the healer’s consciousness. We shall call this type of cylinder the Wands of Horus Mono While they have all the qualities of the Wands of Horus with small-particle quartzite filling, the Wa n ds of H or u s Mono have several important differences: First the Wands of Horus Mono have a more powerful impulse-based stimulating effect on a person’s energy structure. As a consequence, if this type of Wands of Horus is used by people with a weak energy system, it may induce a pain syndrome in a pr oblem area. This is due to the increased intensity with which energy moves along the channels. If so me energy canal is “cluttered up” and lacks the necessary conductivity, then the sensation of inflation or pressure that arises at the site of a problem may develop into pain. It is for this reason that we do not recommend this type for people who have suffered a heart attack or stroke. Second In interacting with a person’s en ergy structure (aura), the Wands of Horus Mono begin to literally scan the user’s organism, after which the energy system (aura) itself begins to work on the specific pathology in the organism. It is for this reason that many users of the Wands of Horus Mono have noticed the appearance of sensations of vibrations or sort of jerks in localized (problem) zones. The monocrystals used in this type of Wands of Horus are carefully selected in accordance with special criteria. Third Due to the homogeneous structur e of the monocrystal placed in the Wands of Horus , their effect on the electromagnetic and energy capsule (fie ld) of the human organism stimulates the organism to produce an energy cocoon of a special type of energy around the body. This energy submits well to thought control. This is precisely why for many ancien t civilisations quartz was a sacred mineral, while Wands of Horus with monocrystals were an inseparable part of the life and activities of the priestly healers. In essence, Wands of Horus Mono are something like thought amplifiers. Provided users work with them regularly (preferably by the sea or in a forest), in three weeks Wands of Horus Mono will create an up to 3-metre cocoon (aura) ar ound them, completely restoring their energy balance. No other tool available today has such an effect. Possessors of such an aura can take a sick person into their energy field and act upon the disorder in the patient’s body without using their hands (no passes), simply and exclusively by the power of thought, by imagining what should take place in the diseased organ. This opens up fundamentally different possibilities for the diagnosis and treatment of the sick and for the development of parapsychological potential. This was indirectly registered at the Polyclinic of the Medical Centre of the Administration of the Russian Federation President in Moscow. During the experiment with the Wands of Horus Mono electroencephalograph (EEG) recordings were made registering changes in the bio-elect ric activity of the cerebral cortex. The Wands of Horus were held for only five minutes. The experiment showed a reduction in asymmetry between the hemispheres in the rear section. Polymorphic beta activity (from 16 to 40+ Hz) growing in amplitude was registered in all areas of the cerebral cortex."},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"The Wands of Horus Different Types of Wands of Horus . 20 Third Edition - December 2001 Overall the experiment showed that using the Wands of Horus Mono caused a synchronisation of the two hemispheres, in other words levels out the potentials of the cerebral cortex of the right and left hemispheres of the brain. Even the brief influence of the Wands of Horus on the human psycho-physical field and energy structure stimulates concentration on self-made internal images, intensifying the trance or meditative effect. Whereas psychics often need months of unremit ting training to attain the necessary levels, when the Wands of Horus Mono are used, training times are substantially reduced, while the effect obtained significantly exceeds thos e that can be attained by ordinary means. The Wands of Horus Crystal (several crystals in each wand) possess the same properties as the Wands of Horus Mono but to a less pronounced degree due to the absence of a completely homogenous crystal structure. Their effect is more general. The Wands of Horus Crystal are an intermediate tool between the Wa n ds of H or u s Quartz and the Wands of Horus Mono . For the priests of Aakh (Ankh) a special place was al ways occupied by an instrument shrouded in mystery, the basis of which was the specially prep ared “Spring” crystal. The crystal was specially selected and treated in a particular way to attune it to a specific individual. The production of such a highly individual tool was a long process. After the tuning, the crystal became effectively an “energy source” intended to tap into the sour ce of natural cosmic energy. In trib ute to the creators of this amazing instrument, we shall call this type of cylinder Wands of Horus Spring . Wa nd s o f H o r us Kont with carbon and ferromagnetic fillings are good for those with high blood pressure and also as a means of effective (rapid) reco very after stress and improvement of sleep patterns. Any type of wand effectively restores the nervous system, but Wands of Horus Kont have a more pronounced impulse effect capable of getting a problem moving, which is good in critical situations. It should be remembered, however, that the energy (pranic) cocoon created by the Wands of Horus Kont will not be lasting, due to the impulse nature of the effect. In contrast to the Wands of Horus Kont , the Wands of Horus Quartz have a gentle effect with a deep, lasting result, but at times of flare-up this may prove inadequate. Wands of Horus Quartz large-grain are intended for people with a normal vascular (energy) system. This type has a pronounced general stimulatory effect on the vascular (energy), nervous and endocrinal systems. They produce very good results when used in conjunction with salt baths. Any type of Wands of Horus Quartz stabilizes low blood pressure to the norm de termined by the organism itself. They also normalize blood pressure in non-chronic forms of hypertension. With their gentle, yet deep effect on the human organism, the Wands of Horus are highly efficacious in countering stress, insomnia and nervous tensions. Wands of Horus Quartz medium-grain have a more powerful stim ulatory effect. They are intended for more intensive action upon the vascular (energy) system as the next stage after the Wands of Horus Quartz fine-grain. They are very effective in cases of arthritis, arthrosis and polyarthritis in combination with salt baths. Wa nd s o f H o r us Quartz fine-grain are intended for people with weak vasucual (energy) systems, those who have recently suffered a stroke or a heart attack (cardiac infarction) The use of the Wands of Horus encourages the activation of blood circulation. In people with a weakened energy system that may cause sensations of pressure or pain in a problem area. Therefore those with a weak vascular (energy) system and also those whos have suffered vascular incidents (heart attack, stroke) should use wands filled with fine-grain quartz. They have a mild stimulating effect without causing unpleasant sensations. Conclusion The material you have just read mentions restrictions and gives a brief list of the illnesses and situations where the cylinders have a beneficial effect. If certain conditions are observed and a systematic approach taken, the cylinders can not on ly correct, but also improve your energy and immune systems. But that requires systematic daily work founded on a precise understanding of what the Wands of Horus are, the principle by which they function, knowle dge of the elements making up the complex, a vital part of which is interaction with natural energy sources, knowledge of human cycles and those of the Earth, and also a clear idea of what you want to achieve and why."},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"The Wands of Horus The Results of Studies into the Effects of the Wands of Horus . 21 Third Edition - December 2001 The Results of Studies into the Effects of the Wands of Horus Medical Studies M.A. Nikulin, a senior research worker at the Dzhanelidze First Aid Scientific Research Institute in St Petersburg with a Ph.D. in medicine, came to the following conclusion after a medical study of the effect of the cylinders on the human organism: “Where there are abnormalities of any kind in a person’s body we observe a thermal asymmetry between the diseased parts and the healthy ones. When held in the hands the cylind ers balance out this pathological thermal asymmetry, which indicates that they have a therapeutic effect.” Some interesting results were obtained in the study carried out by M.A. Blank a Ph.D. in medicine and a leading specialist of the Central Scientific Research Institute for Roentgenology and Radiology at the Oncological Institute in Pesochny outside St Petersburg. Dr Blank made the following comment: “There is a parameter that characterises the functioning of cells — the respiratory waves of cells. An oncological condition in the organism suppresses those respiratory waves, but the Cylinders of the Pharaoh on the contrary improve that parameter. But cancer is a very serious citadel; you won’t take it with such gentle means. Unless perhaps as a prophylactic measure, but that deduction requires further study. One thing is clear: where cancer makes things bad, the cylinders try to make them a little better.” [2 ] Particularly striking are the results of a study into the effect of the Wands of Horus on the human organism conducted on 13 July 1999 at the Polyclinic of the Medical Centre of the Administration of the Russian Federation President in Moscow. During the experiment with the Wands of Horus Quartz electroencephalograph (EEG) recordings were made registering changes in the bio-electric activ ity of the cerebral cortex. Below is the analysis of the EEG of N.V. Vasina, a 50-year-old woman. She held the Wands of Horus for only five minutes. Conclusion 1. The EEG shows a gentle change in the bio- electric activity of the cerebral cortex. 2. In comparison with an EEG from 5 May 1999, the alpha-rhythm with a frequency of 10 Hz and amplitude of 40–50 μ V is registered more stably acros s all areas of the cerebral cortex; the between the hemisphere asymmetry in the rear sections has reduced, as are episodes of dysrhythmia. Polymorphic beta activity (from 16 to 40+ Hz) growing in amplitude is registered in all areas of the cerebral cortex. 3. Functional loading emphasises th ese changes, adding slight in volvement of the dienchephalic structures. Dr N.V. Platonova In order to explain the importance of these results it should be stressed that it is precisely the stability of the alpha rhythms and the level and amplitude of the beta activity that distinguish the EEG readings of someone who has developed their psychic capacities with all manner of meditative and psycho-physical exercises over a prolonged period from the readings of an ordinary person who has done nothing to develop himself or herself. In a “practisin g” individual these indicators are better. In the above case, the experiment registered an improvement afte r five minutes’ work with the cylinders. In other words, the Wa nd s of H orus display an active stimulating effect on the hemispheres of the brain, putting it into a special, more harmonious state in which the user will receive a more profound positive effe The stability of the effect obtained from working with the cylinders will depend not only on the individual characteristics of each person, but also on the frequency and duration of sessions with the Wands of Horus . Undoubtedly regular work with the cylinders will give a more stable result."},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"The Wands of Horus The Results of Studies into the Effects of the Wands of Horus . 22 Third Edition - December 2001 A further comment on the analysis of the effect of the Wands of Horus Mono on a person’s EEG In other words, even the brief (5-minute) influence of the Wands of Horus on the human psycho- physical field and energy structure stimulates a person’s concentration on the inte rnal (mental) images he or she creates, intensifying the trance, meditative effect. While a psychic practitioner often needs months of intense training to attain the necessary level of concentration, with the use of the Wands of Horus Mono the training time is significantly reduced an d the result obtained significantly exceeds that which can be obtained by the usual methods. Moreover, practice has shown that as a result of using the Wands of Horus Mono a synchronisation of the two hemispheres is achieved, that is an evening-out of the potentials of the cortices of the left and right hemispheres. There is an effect of deeper a nd gentler immersion into the meditative state that corresponds to the theta rhythms. A similar result can be attained by ot her methods, for example with the aid of binaural waves using sound fed through earphones. The Wands of Horus Mono , however, have a gentler effect on a person’s energy field and, more over, have a prolonged effect. The person’s energy field remembers, as it were, the rhythms that ar ose while the Wands were working and continues maintaining them for a period between 24 hours and several days. Irina and Mikhail Kosh Astropsychologists, Moscow The View of Bio-Physicists The existence of a contact difference in potential between the cylinders shifts the organism into another, “higher” energetic state, in which those restorative processes encouraging the harmonisation of the whole organism take place more actively. This effect is obtained by a combination of galavanotherapy, metallotherapy and the presence of weak physical fields created by the fillings of the cylinders that have a therapeutic effect on the or ganism through the bio-active points of the palms. [2 ] The Views of Specialists in Chi Kung, Yoga & Other Bio-energetic Practices Are Roughly Unanimous The influence of the cylinders increases the movement of chi or qi ( prana ) energy in the energy meridians or canals. Due to the increased movement of chi , canals “furred up” by disorders are actively cleaned out and a healthy energy balance between th e organs is restored as a result. The increased movement of chi causes a pricking sensation or numbness in the tips of the fingers, pulsation in the centre of the palms and soles. Th e process of clearing blockages may cause a fairly wide range of sensations, the most common of which are vibration, pressure or bursting in certain parts of the body, to the point of tolerable, rapidly passing pain, ringing in the ears, slight dizziness. As the energy balance is restored those sensations disappear. Regular use of the Wands of Horus, while observing a number of rules in daily life, strengthens and reinforces one’s energetic potential right up to the point of establishing contact with higher forms of intelligence and the manifestation of other superior capabilities associated with the healthy and morally pure human being. [2 ] Processes taking place within the organism under the influence of the Wands of Horus that have been registered by measuring devices “... In the first few minutes a pulse wave from the left side to the right can be observed in subjects holding the cylinders. A sensation of the vessels filling with blood is registered that researchers have termed “the vascular stage”. Infrared radiation incr eases from the right upper limb, and then the thermal field at the limbs evens out. Together with these changes in the subject’s or ganism, a general rise in activity is observed, accompanied by an 8–10 beats per minute increase in pulse-rate. By the second minute a warming of the cervico-thor acic section of the spinal column with increased infrared radiation was also observed. It follows, then, that the whole of the vegetative nervous system is drawn into the process, and there is an energetic activation of the tissues of both the upper limbs, and the body as a whole.

[2 ] A number of targeting experiments carried out by K.G. Korotkov, a researcher at the Centre for Energo-Information Technology at the St Petersburg State Institute of Precise Mechanics and Optics, using the Kirlian diagnostic method indicated that clearer information on the indications of illness was obtained from people holding the cylinders. In other words, in some instances the cylinders significantly increase the accuracy of diagnosis. Another series of targeting experiments carried out by Dr Blank at the Oncological Institute in Pesochny established that the influence of the cylinders puts the organism in a condition where it is much easier for it to deal with its diseases and problems itself. Dr Blank believes that the cylinders can be recommended as a pr ophylactic measure against jet-lag for those who frequently travel from one time-zone to another (pilots, sportsmen, tourists, long-distance lorry-drivers, and so on) for whom the clash between external and internal rhythms causes sluggishness and headaches. The study of the effectiveness of the cylinders was carried out in April 1993 and December 1995 using modern equipment and the most advanced meth ods that were put forward for the Nobel Prize in 1990 by a group of medical scientists at the Dzhanelidze First Aid Scientific Research Institute led by Dr M.A. Nikulin. From the results obtained, the Wands of Horus can be recommended for people suffering from: ■ cardio-vascular diseases; ■ hypertension in the early stage; ■ neurotrophic disorders; ■ neurotrophic disorders; ■ nsomnia and also as a means of removing st ress and guarding against atherosclerosis. [2 ] The use of the Wands of Horus in conjunction with natural sources of energy The best place to work or meditate with the cylinder s is in a natural setting close to natural sources of energy, such as water (a river, lake, the s ea or ocean), in a forest or in the mountains. It is best to stand bare-footed. This improves the energy-exchange and metabolic processes in the organism. Astonishing results are obtained from working with trees. Trees, as natural sources of energy, present a unique opportunity to tap into a natural an d truly pure flow of energy. The choice of tree and the time of day depends on the biological and energetic rhythms of the tree and on the task to be tackled. The table below will help in the selection of the tree and the time to work with it. Table 2: The energetic and biological rhythms of trees for the correction of the energetic and physical state of a human being Species Period of greatest energy activity Period of least energy activity Character of the energy and potential applications Birch 5 - 9 a.m. 3 - 4 a.m. Calming, encouraging the healing of wounds and skin ulcers, reducing the pain of injuries, restoring the nervous system, anti-stress effect, encouraging the normal functioning of the digestive system, against colitis, encourages the healing of stomach and duodenal ulcers, beneficial effect in cases of low acidity Maple 7 -10 a.m. 4 - 5 a.m. Soft, relaxing energy has a beneficial influence on a person’s energy shell, harmonising (balancing) it; easily removes mental tension; beneficial effect on the digestion in cases of increased peristalsis (diarrhoea) (with the exception of infectious diseases and excess stomach acid)"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"The Wands of Horus The Results of Studies into the Effects of the Wands of Horus . 24 Third Edition - December 2001 ✚ You should put your hand to the trunk and make sure there is a flow of energy. If no flow can be detected, the tree is in a state of minimal activity (sleep). ✟ In this case (with the exception of the period of minimal activity) you need to put your hand to the trunk and, after tuning in to the tree, determine the strength and qualities of the energy passing into your hand. You should try several trees and select the most active and most suitable for you. Work with deciduous trees is possible only betw een spring and early autumn. You can work with conifers all year round. You should chose a tree with which to interact in the same sort of way as you choose a friend. You should follow your instinct when making a decision. It is important to know that trees have their energy centres ( chakra ). There can be two or three of them, depending of the age and condition of the tree. The first chakra is located about a metre from the base (the ground); the second where the branches spread into the crown. The location of the third chakra varies between individual trees. We will work with the Ash 11 a.m. – 1 p.m. ✚ (see footnote) Encourages a decline in pain in the region of the heart, eases spasms in stenocardia, partially normalises heart rhythm in arrhythmia, encourages the loss of over-agitation, depression and a sense of fear, encourages better circulation in anaemia of the extremities. (Repeated interaction with the energy of the ash improves memory and attentiveness.) Pine ✟ (see footnote) 4 - 5 a.m. The energy is disorderly and impulsive, increases vigour, improves immunity, the organism’s defensive reactions. You should interact with the energy of the pine before 9 p.m. Prolonged interaction leads to insomnia and greater agitation; it increases sexual activeness. Alder continuous 1.30 - 3.30 a.m. The energy is disorderly. It encourages the loss of nervous tension. (Abuse of the energy of the alder can lead to serious nervous breakdowns.) Aspen 2–5 p.m. 2 - 3 a.m. A “vampire” tree. Used sensibly it encourages the discharge of diseased energy and loss of agitation and has a pain-killing effect in cases of osteochondrosis and radiculitis, headaches, pains in the area of the eyes, hypertension and haemorrhoids. Interaction with the energy of the aspen should be avoided in cases of low blood-pressure. It can lead to headaches, nausea and dizziness. Extremely harmful in asthma and bronchitis. Leads to breathing difficulties. Poplar 3–6 p.m. 4 - 5 a.m. A tree that has a moderate absorbing effect. Good in cases of hypertension. Willow 6–9 p.m. 2 - 3 a.m. A calming, relaxing energy encourages physical and nervous unwinding. Good in cases of disturbed sleep, headaches, breathlessness, asthma and breathing problems. A prophylactic against kidney troubles. Oak 9 p.m. – 3 a.m. 3–5 p.m. A powerful, even energy. Work should be performed only when you are in a good (balanced) state of mind. Has a powerful stabilising effect, helps in cases of lack of appetite, over-tiredness, listlessness, vitamin deficiency, low blood-pressure and poor hearing. Chestnut 1 - 5 a.m. 7 - 8 a.m. Impulsive energy, encourages the restoration of the menstrual cycle. Prolonged interaction can provoke hallucinations (nightmares). Lime (Linden) 2 - 6 a.m. 6 - 7 a.m. A strong, yet gentle energy, creating a sensation of warmth and encouraging the onset of calm. Helpful for asthma, lung diseases and other respiratory disorders.

All three types of en ergy that you can use wi thout harming the tree are concentrated there. In essence work or interaction with a tree resembles the process of meditation. After choosing a tree you should stand with your back to it, leaning the back of your head against it (your first chakra will be roughly level with that of the tree), and merge yourself with it. Become a single whole. Then you should mentally analyse the problem you want to solve and, asking for the help of the tree, interact. Remember it is vital that you feel a flow of energy from the tree. Although sensations vary, the necessary state is comparable with a very slight vibration inside you. Th at is the indication that interaction is taking place. Feelings are the best guide to the length of a session. We should like to stress that you can work with trees both holding the cylinders and without them. A tree is in itself a powerful source of energy. It is ther efore possible to interact with the energy of trees without the cylinders and obtain a substantial healing effect. Not only the Druids, but also the Ancient Egyptians knew of, and judging by surviving monument s, used the healing energy of trees. The most obvious way of passing on such knowledge so that it could be understood by people centuries later without the need for any language was a drawing. Using the language of symbols, the Ancient Egyptian priests left us information that the sycamore tree possesses energy important to human beings. The depiction of a goddess representing the energetic or \"divine\" plane emerging from the trunk of the tree was the priests' way of telling us that the tree (through the hands of the goddess) gives energy to a person and his BA. The main sense of the imag e is that the energy a person receives from the tree, charges, af fects not only the person, but also his BA.] The BA is one of the components of the human soul, depicted in the form of a \"bird-man\" symbolizing the capacity of the human consciousness to move in space like a bird. Symbolically, the concept of energy was written as a wavy line or a \"sawtooth\" hieroglyph. (See “Appendix 8” on page 66 ) But what is actually happening when a person works with the cylinders in the forest or on the seashore? The human organism is constructed in such a way that any close contact with the world of nature causes our energy centres ( chakras ) to become active, increasing the intensity of energy absorption by some 10–20% (depending on the individual). After the interaction is over, this activeness gradually drops to the previous level over a period of 12–36 hours, again depending on a person’s individual nature (32 ). Since the cylinders are powerful activators of the hu man energy system, using them “in the bosom of nature” not only makes it possible to increase the intensity with which the chakras absorb the energy flow to 40% of the potential, but also to extend the period when the chakras operate in this mode up to 48 hours. Such an activation of the energy centres makes it possible to increase a person’s energy potential and bio-field (on the energy plane). On the physical pl ane activation encourages th e normalisation of blood circulation and the attainment of the individually a ppropriate blood pressure, act ing beneficially on the cardio-vascular system. Working every day with the Wa nd s o f H o rus helps to strengthen immunity (especially when they are used in a natural setting). The list would be incomplete without a mention of their powerful anti-stress effect and the strengthening of the nervous system obtained through systematic work with the Wands of Horus . The use of the cylinders is very beneficial for women going through the menopause. Concluding this section, we should stress that working with the cylinders in a natural setting you will feel their effect more strongly as any natural en ergy source, be it tree or water, helps the organism to tune into the cylinders more quickly and deeply."},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"The Wands of Horus Sensations Experienced When Using the Wands of Horus . 26 Third Edition - December 2001 Sensations Experienced When Using the Wands of Horus Analysing the sensations reported by those who have tried the Wands of Horus for a greater or lesser length of time, it is possible to distinguish three basic groups: 1) No sensations As a rule, a lack of sensation indicates that th e given person’s organism is “furred up” to a considerable extent. In this case an appropriate diet is necessary to clean out the organism (its energy canals). One of the best diets (although the individual peculiarities of each person should always be borne in mind) is to eat fruit an vegetables only for four days of the week (96 hours) feeling constantly hungry. Scientific research has shown that people holding the Wands of Horus are influenced by them, no matter what their subjective sensations, alth ough the activity and effectiveness of the Wands of Horus is directly related to the degree to which an organism is furred up. It is for this same reason that when preparing for an act of dedication or initiation (“Intercourse with the gods”), the Ancient Egyptians kept a ten-day fast and appropriate di ets to clean out the organism. 2) Weak sensations This group includes the bulk of those surveyed . They experience either warmth or coolness, a pulsation in the hands, a slight prickling, some times an increase in pulse-rate, very occasionally dizziness. 3) Strong sensations This small group includes people who feel powerfu l internal vibrations, accompanied by a mild loss of feeling in the fingers. Some people feel “flows” of energy washing over their bodies inside and out. Some feel an irresistible upward urge, as if their whole bodies were trying to take off. We should point out that, although these three main categories do exist, the range and strength of sensations can fluctuate. This is due to the energy cycles of the Earth and the individual. There will be days when, for objective reasons of a cosmic nature, your energy system will be insufficiently active and therefore the sensations will be weak or absent altogether, although you have become used to feeling the effect of the Wands of Horus . A tendency to have “visions” while using the cylin ders suggests a tendency towards psychological illness. We do not recommend using the cylinders in such cases. It does not make sense to view the cylinders only as a treatment for one disease or another. The Wands of Horus are above all a prophylactic device providin g the opportunity in certain diseases to correct deviations from the norm and thus prompt a significant improvement in your condition. First and foremost, though, the cylinders are a tool for “attainment”, allowing you to achieve a step- by-step evolution of your capacities. The material you have already read mentions restrictions and gives a brief list of the illnesses and situations where the cylinders have a beneficial effect. If certain conditions are observed and a systematic approach taken, the cylinders can not on ly correct, but also improve your energy and immune systems. But that requires systematic daily work founded on a precise understanding of what the Wands of Horus are, the principle by which they function, knowle dge of the elements making up the complex, a vital part of which is interaction with natural energy sources, knowledge of human cycles and those of the Earth, and also a clear idea of what you want to achieve and why. Mankind still does not know that the chief object of study in the universe is mankind itself. Mankind has not yet embarked on the road to grasping that gr eatest of all secrets, leadin g to an understanding of the Creator, the very first step along which is to be the discovery of the secret of mankind."},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"The Wands of Horus Sensations Experienced When Using the Wands of Horus . 27 Third Edition - December 2001 The Mechanism by which the Wands of Horus act The mechanism by which the cylinders act on the hu man organism is fairly complicated. We shall therefore try to explain in more basic terms that none theless convey fairly accura tely the main idea of the process. People who seek after knowledge are familiar with the concept of energy shel ls that, according to a certain Eastern tradition, make up the energy structure of the human being. We know about the existence of the ethereal body, the astral body, the mental body and so on, up to the seventh energy body. But there is evidence that the ancient hierophant s knew of the existence of several more energy bodies or shells, of which the present-day esoteric and other schools tell us nothing. The final energy body, still unknown to humanity today, is the shell through which each person has direct contact with what people call “God” or the “Source” of everything, all knowledge and energy. Th rough that shell we have a link to all the world around us, as we are part of the Great Creative Principl e. Since we possess that shell, we are ourselves in a way sources of energy. Let us examine the human energy structure from viewpoints more accessible to the present-day reader. What people commonly call the “aura” or “biological field” is the consequence of the interaction of the vibrations of various energy layers (bodies) within the human energy system. The existing names of the energy bodies in any of the familiar traditions is nothing more than an agreed convention. Therefore, for the convenience and ease of understa nding particularly of a reader unfamiliar with “esoteric” doctrines, we shall call the first energy body “ethereal”, the second “astral”, the third “mental”, and so on. The human energy system consists of several energy bodies (levels), that differ in shape, energy density, and vibratory rhythm (frequency). Most impo rtantly, though, they have different characteristics. In examining the effect of the Wands of Horus on the human organism, we shall stick to the first two structures that are responsible directly for a person’s bio-energetic rhythm and emotional state. The first energy body consists of vibrations an d temperature rhythms in the person’s physical structure. Therefore any process taking place in the physical body is immediatel y reflected in the first energy body. For example, an inflammatory process has begun loca lised in the small of the back (lumbago). That is followed by oedema and an increase in temperatur e that immediately finds reflection in the altered shape and vibratory frequency of the corresponding part of the first energy body. Hence, influencing that part of the energy body and correcting the vibratory frequency leads to a reduction in the pain syndrome. The lines of the first energy body precisely follow those of the physical body, forming an energy lay between 0.3 and 2–3 metres thick. (33 ) The first energy body is the receptor and distributor of transformed cosmic energy — prana . It is through this body that our physical body becomes charged with the vital energy our organism needs The second, astral energy body is responsible for our emotional state and any nervous or psychological stress evokes changes in this body. The upsurge of emotions in stress leads to the de stabilisation of the structure of the second energy body producing changes that subsequently lead to discomfort and neuro-psychological problems. The human energy system has centres, known as chakras , through which the organism interacts with the outside world. We can picture a chakra as a sort of energy vortex (or funnel). The transformed energy of the cosmos, the earth, water, sunlight enters the physical body through the chakras . The chakras , being the immediate conductors of energy that has been proces sed in the energy system pass it on to the person’s endocrine system. All the chakras are connected to our physical body and are sort of projections of the endocrine system. The main energy centres, while being projections of the endocrine system, also have their own projections. The first chakra has projections on the feet; the seventh chakra on the palms. As soon as we pick up the Wands of Horus three parallel processes begin simultaneously. 1. As you probably know, copper and zinc are a galvanic couple. As soon as you take the cylin- ders in your two hands a potential difference of 0.8–1 volt, sometimes more, forms between them."},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"The Wands of Horus Sensations Experienced When Using the Wands of Horus . 28 Third Edition - December 2001 The main electrochemical parameter of the bl ood (pH) is determined by the number of positive electrical charges carried by positive hydrogen ions in proportion to the number of negative electrical charges carried by hydroxyl ions (OH-). If there are the same number of positive and negative charges, then overall the blood is electrically neutral, since charges of opposite sign cancel each other out. This is the optimal state necessary for the normal functioning of the organism. It is in this stat e that many vital processes can proceed (such as the breaking down of proteins). Changes in the ratio of positive and negative ions lead to a whole number of functional disruptions in the organism. The presence of a potential difference causes th e process of balancing out (harmonizing) the ratio of charged particles. (Detailed information about the physicochemical processes that take place in the organism will be presented in a separate appendix to the instructions for use of the Wands of Horus.) 2. As the cylinders absorb warmth from the hands, the crystals of quartz inside the cylinders expand. That in turn leads to a deformation of the surface of the tiny crystals and produces what is known as the piezo-electric effect. 3. The human organism is, as we know, a kind of electrical generator. When we pick up the cylinders we immediately pass our own electricity on to them. The result of all three processes is a polarisation of the crystals in the cylinders. With the appearance of a potential difference at the ends of a crystal a weak excitement of the crystal lattice takes place. This in turn leads to a rise in the crystal’s energy level and in the activity of the en ergy flow emerging from the crystal. At the same time, when we hold the Wands of Horus in our hands, under the influence of the human biological field through the projection of th e corresponding energetic centres, located in the palms, they begin to activate the 6th and 7th chakras , and the 6th and 7th energy structures around those chakras . On the physical plane there is stimulation of the hypothalamus and hypophysis as they are projections of those energy centres in the physical human body. Activation of these centres leads to activation of the last energy shell, that is as yet un known to mankind, and the organism begins to receive energy directly from the “Source”. The incoming en ergy from the crystals an d the “Source” forming the human energy system, plus the piezo-e lectricity generated by the crystals in the filling forms an energy cocoon around the person’s body. This “pranic coco on”, vibrating at a freq uency dictated by the hypothalamus and hypophysis through their projections located in the centre of the palms, corrects all the holder’s energy structure, giving a beneficial effect to the whole organism. The impulses passing through the hypothalamus and hypophysis switch on the processes of regeneration and self-healing. (34 ) The essence of this phenomenon that is ob served is that at the moment when the Wa nd s o f H o rus , interacting with processes within the organism (against the background of the polarisation process), attunes itself to the holder, the organism itself sets the vibration, the rhythm that it requires at that particular time. The rhythm is dictated by the charact eristic vibration of the person, a sort of individual code. It is that individual vibration interacting with the crystal that causes the crystal lattice to resonate, setting the required rhythm. That rhythm (individual vibration) acts like a starter-motor in a car, providing the impulse, starting the process by which the Wands of Horus subsequently themselves begin to vibrate at the appropriate frequency. The Wands of Horus create and maintain an energy shell that, with the aid of the required vibratory frequency, initiates the process of self-correction. The flow of energy passing through the 7th chakra is transformed into a flow of vibrations at a particular frequency and harmonises the energy sh ell (aura), evening it out. It is worth mentioning here that the elongated h eadgear of the pharaoh was a special concentrator, also focusing on the energetic projections of th e hypophysis and hypothalamus. This concentrator, stimulating those two zones, supported and cultivated, as it were, the potential of the energy cocoon, increasing the immune reactivity of the organism. The complex consisting of the Wands of Horus and the concentrator, improved the health of the organism, particularly its immune status, and regulated the metabolic processes. But there was more to the work th an just that. In order to prepare for work within the pyramid and to gain the capacity to foresee the future, you need energy. Therefore the pharaoh and the hierophants tried not to squander the energy recei ved, storing it up, leading an appropriate lifestyle and bringing their abilities up to the necessary level. The third, “mental” energy body is connected with what people as sociate with the concept of the “soul” (a person’s psychological condition). Harmonisation of this energy body with the aid of the"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"The Wands of Horus Sensations Experienced When Using the Wands of Horus . 29 Third Edition - December 2001 Wands of Horus creates the preconditions necessary for the stabilisation and development of mental capacities. The basic sequence by which the Wands of Horus work is as follows: By galvanic and piezo-electric effects (raising the energy level of the crystals in the filling) stimulating the 6th and 7th energy centres, the Wands of Horus act on the central nervous system. From the central nervous system an impulse passes to the hypothalamus, from the hypothalamus to the hypophysis. Then on to the endocrine system (the secr etionary glands), then to the organs. The reverse reaction flows along two paths: 1. From the endocrine system to the central nervous system 2. Through the state of the organs to the central nervous Thus information about the state of the secretionary organs and disorders of the internal organs is passed from the endocrine system and the organs to the central nervous system. When it gets this information, the central nervous system directs the si gnals to the hypothalamus and hypophysis that in turn activate the functions of self-healing and regeneration, if those functions are in order and not hampered by, among other things, significant “furring ” of the relevant energy canals. In the event of inadequate functioning of the energy canal s, the energy cocoon generated by the Wands of Horus vibrating at the frequency dictated by the hypothal amus and hypophysis assumes an intermediary role conveying the blocked signal and stimulating the functions of self-healing and regeneration. (1 ). The “pranic cocoon” produced by the Wands of Horus kont (carbon and ferro-magnetic) has a powerful impulse effect on the human organism, but it is not stable. Irrespective of how long you work with this type of cylinder, even two or three days, the cocoon they create disperses completely within 24 hours. Hence, to maintain the cocoon produced by this type of cylinder requires work every single day. The Wands of Horus Quartz , filled with crystals of quartz, produce a “pranic cocoon” that has a gentle, even, but deep-acting effect on the human orga nism. The cocoon created by this type of cylinder is very stable. If you work with the Wands of Horus Quartz continuously for a week, then the cocoon they create will last for three weeks, continuing its corrective effect on the whole organism. To correct pathological conditions that have built up over a number of years, the organism and the Wands of Horus need time. Therefore work with the cylinders must be regular and continuous. The deep correction required for serious conditions may take several months. Remember that we spend years acquiring our problems and do not worry if you do not experience rapid results."},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"The Wands of Horus The use of copper patches to stimulate the immune system & direct the effect to pathological conditions of particular organs . 30 The use of copper patches to stimulate the immune system & direct the effect to pathological conditions of particular organs To intensify the stimulating effect of the Wands of Horus on the immune system and for a deeper corrective effect on the secondary consequences (symptoms) of diseases, as well as on diseases in a latent phase, it is necessary to use the Wa nd s o f Horus in conjunction with special copper patches. These copper patches are applied to the appr opriate acupuncture points on the body. First, the use of the patches in conjunction with the Wa nd s o f H o rus enables the vibrations to penetrate deeper and have a more beneficial influence on the organism and its pathology. Secondly, the use of the patches makes it possible to have a effect directed on a particular organ (disorder) or on the immune system as a whole. In principle, the use of copper patches opens up extensive opportunities for targeted work on pathological conditions of various organs, but, on the other hand, we would like to stress immediately and especially, that such work should only be pe rformed in consultation with a specialist capable of effectively and continuously assessing the conditio n of whatever organ is the target of the work. Practice has shown that the majority of acupuncture practitioners and psychic healers lack sufficient knowledge for such work. The whole point is that any deep-reaching influence on the human organism produces certain response reactions. Those reactions may express themselves in certain changes in the location of acupuncture points, and, most significan tly, in the appearance of surplus energy in some organ which the specialist should imme diately detect and correct. In this context it should be stressed that the Chinese “map” of acupuncture points that is extensively used throughout the world is correct only for a healthy person. The first drawback of this map lies in the fact that it does not take into account the individual peculiarities we all have. There are no two identical people in the whole world. The second and chief drawback lies in the fact that it does not take into account that the advance of particular diseases (especially serious ones) is accompanied by changes in the locations of acupuncture points and their coincidence with the corresponding nodes in the person’s energy system. It is therefore impossible of course to produce a single map that can take accoun t of all the possible shifts of acupuncture points in all the variations of pathological processes. It follo ws that working with the map without taking account of the factors just mentioned either produces no re sult or accelerates the pathol ogical process, moving the disease on to the next phase. And every successive transition to the next phase of the disease will be accompanied by changes in the lo cation of acupuncture points. Therefore for the effective use of the Wands of Horus in conjunction with copper patches we stress that any person can use this combination independently and unsupervised only in the following cases: 1. General energy stimulation (Stimulation of the immune system). In this case the patches should be applied to four points: ■ Two Hegu (L14) points on the left and right hands ■ Two Zusanli (St. 36) points on the left and right legs 2. Energy imbalance The patches are applied to the Hegu and Zusanli points on the side where there is insufficient en ergy. This produces a evening-out redistribution. In all other cases the use of copper patches requ ires a consultation with and close supervision by a specialist."},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"The Wands of Horus The use of copper patches to stimulate the immune system & direct the effect to pathological conditions of particular organs . 31 The targeting of diseased organs w ith the aid of copper patches and the Wands of Horus can produce a good therapeutic effect in cases of a serious dystrophic process, such as diabetes mellitus. The powerful stimulation provoking a certain energetic activity can produce a positive result as a result of an energetic impulse stimulating (awakening) the function of the pancreas, as its function turned out to be suppressed due to insulin injections. In this case, however, for a positive result it is vital to monitor blood-sugar level constantly as an energy surplus may produce jumps in blood sugar. Following what has been said, we should particularly stress the impermissibility of any sort of experiments on the part of acupuncturists or psychic healers lacking the necessary knowledge and experience in this specific field, but hoping perhaps to find a niche for themselves giving practi cal directions on the use of the Wands of Horus in conjunction with copper patches. There is no general pattern here, and there cannot be one. The approach to each person must be individual be accompanied with a full awareness of responsibility for his or her health."},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"The Wands of Horus How the Wands of Horus Were Made . 32 Third Edition - December 2001 How the Wands of Horus Were Made The technology used to produce the Wands of Horus and all the other elemen ts of the complex took into account the pyramid’s ability to affect certain characteristics of materials. It was precisely for that reason that the production of the Wands of Horus was directly connected with the pyramid. The bodies of the wands were cast in moulds of the appropriat e shape and after the metal solidified (crystallised) they were placed in the pyramid with the result that the metal’s crystal lattice acquired special qualities under the influence of the pyramid. The structural field of the pyramid has a correcting effect on the distances between the atoms, as a result of which the lattice becomes more pe rfect, which meant that even at this stage the material from which the wand s were made possessed miraculous qualities. The fillings were also subjected to treatment of an appropriate kind in the pyramid. As was already stated, at the beginning of the pro cess of self-perfection the hierophant or pharaoh used a special sort of white sand that was processe d in the pyramid’s structuring field for a period of twelve diurnal cycles. The decisive factor in choosing the fillings was the qualities of the crystal lattice. Under the influence of the pyramid the crystal lattice of the quartz changed its qualities, becoming more regular, flawless, and consequently better in terms of its resonant properties. (35 ). In the subsequent stages of the process of self-p erfection, special crystals were placed inside the Wands of Horus . Their more perfect qualities were also ac quired inside the pyramid under the influence of its structuring fields. It is important to note that the orientation of the crystals of the small-grain white sand or large-grain quartzites inside the wands is of no relevance with regard to the law of harmonic resonance. In this instance the significant thing is not the shape or orientation of each indi vidual grain, but the peculiarities of the crystal lattice. It should be stressed that when choosing the fillings for the cylinders it is not absolutely correct to divide them into Yin and Yang, or to associate the qualities of the fillings with the horoscope. This connection is a very conditional one. To better understand the essence of the process, one should bear in mind that BA and KA or Yin and Yang, are two energy flows, two sources of vital energy situated within the human being itself. Their harmonisation therefore requires minerals that possess the relevant properties. Jasper, amber or shungites, for example, were not use d as fillings for the Wands of Horus by the Ancient Egyptians because of the unsuitable qualities of their crystal lattices. The use of quartz was prompted by its unusual, surprising qualities described below. One of the basic concepts in crystallo graphy is the axis of symmetry of a crystal. If you take a quartz crystal with well-developed facets, then from the position of those f acets it is possible to observe one peculiar fact: the vertical axis of symmetry in a quartz crystal is twisted in a spiral. “X-ray examination of the structure of quartz crys tals confirms the deduction made on the basis of morphological and optical peculiarities, that the structure of quartz has a spiral, that is to say helical character. In accordance with this two types of structure can be di stinguished — left-handed (No 3) and right-handed (No 1).” [3 ] To explain one further significant peculiarity of qua rtz we need to turn once again to the conceptual system of the Ancient East. The quartz crystal, like any other, has its energy centre ( chakra ). However, because in quartz the axis of symmetry forms a spiral (36 ), several projections of the main energy centre form within the crystal. That is to say one centre receives energy, but several gi ve it out. You can picture it more precisely in this way: one zone of the crystal accumula tes energy within itself, transfor ms and scatters it. What was one flow becomes several. Precisely due to the helical stru cture and, as a consequence, this scattering effect, Wands of Horus filled with quartz crystals have a gentle, general healing effect on a person’s energo- informational structure and his or her entire organism. Perhaps it was for this very reason that some ancient civilisations cons idered quartz a sacred mineral. It was evidently also connected with quartz’s ability to convey information. In this context it is appropriate to quote from an interview with Professor Vlail Kaznacheyev, the director of the Institute of Clinical and Experimental Medici ne of the Siberian Branch of the Russian Academy of Medical"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"The Wands of Horus How the Wands of Horus Were Made . 33 Third Edition - December 2001 Science, a full member of that academy and of th e Academy of Natural Sciences of the Russian Federation: “In our expe riments we obtain some astonishing things: when one cell culture experiences some stress, it can transmit its condition to another cell culture, if there is an optical channel of communication. The light ray conveys the essence of the matter — and it itself comes alive in a way. Moreover, a tissue culture of living cells of this kind that has perceived the state of its neighbours in a quartz or mica optical channel, can transmit that state on to other cell cultures; and so the accumulation of a property of living material unknown to us passes through the cells for 5, 6, 7 generations in the optical sphere. Mica and quartz are transparent for such effects, just as they are for ordinary light...” In other words, quartz is capable of conveying not simply information, but also a psychological state. Carrying out appropriate research and taking into account the results of a number of scientific experiments, we set about producing the Wands of Horus , guided not only the finest nuances of the technology used when creating them in Ancient Egypt, but also the results of the latest scientific experiments. The metals used to make the cylinders, as well as all the fillings, undergo appropriate processing in a recently-con structed 22-metre pyramid."},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"The Wands of Horus The Results Of Research Into The Effect Of Pyramids . 34 Third Edition - December 2001 The Results Of Research Into The Effect Of Pyramids The time has come and the pyramids are gradually re vealing their secrets to us. Experiments to study the effect of the pyramids on an imate and inanimate objects are changing conceptions about the properties of material. And despite the fact that attitudes to the pyramids are still mixed, they are becoming an ever more forcible presence in our lives, helping us to see the world with different eyes. Recent researches have shown that in an area wi th a concentration of pyramids seismic activity diminishes. More precisely, instead of one powerful earthquake there are hundreds of tiny ones. In the atmosphere above the pyramids the state of the ozone layer improves. Burials of radioactive waste incorporating pyramids lose their deadly properties. Agricultural seeds treated in the pyramid show a 30% to 70% increase in yield. Diamonds synthesised from graphite that has lain for a week in a pyramid turn out purer and ha rder than usual, and more perfect in shape. Water that has been in the pyramids retains its properties for years. A week after a complex of pyramids was installed at the Ishimbai oil-fiel d in Bashkiria (South Russia) the state of the strata chan ged. The oil became lighter (less viscous) and a number of its physical and chemical properties altered (the proportion of ta rs, asphaltene and paraffin). The yield of the oil- wells increased by 30%. The fractional composition of the oil shifted towards the lighter components. Experiments conducted jointly with the Gubkin Oil and Gas Academy in Moscow confirmed these results. The desire naturally arose to test the effect of th e pyramids in the sphere of medicine. The influence of a pyramid on preparations and living organisms ra ised the immune status and regenerated tissues. But we shall limit ourselves to an account of two experi ments carried out by doct ors and physicists in the pyramid constructed by Alexander Golod. Dr N.B. Yegorova, Mechnikov Vaccine Research Institute “My colleagues and I carried out re search to study changes in the general reactivity of the organism on exposure in pyramids. The most informative models were chosen for these mo dels, one of them involving the use of a typhus specific to mice, caused by a bacterium called salmonella typhi murium . All the experiments were carried out on several groups of mice that were placed in pyramids for various lengths of time and various numbers of times. The control group cons isted of mice that were not placed in the pyramids. At various lengths of time after exposure in the pyramids, the mice were infected with salmonella typhi murium and their survival rate was reco rded over the course of a month. “It should be said that infection with salmonella typhi murium is a very serious disease in mice and a handful of cells is practically enough to cause death. By the twenty-fifth day of observation practically all the control animal s had died. Among the groups exposed in the pyramids 3540% survived. There can be no doubt th at this was connected with the time spent in the pyramid. There was no other reason; the more so, since this was not one but several groups of mice. Factors of the natural resistance of the orga nism are undoubtedly at play here. It may be changes is cellular immunity and humoral immunity. The investigation of those factors requires very careful and serious research wh ich we were not able to carry out. “We were very surprised by the result we obtained , because to get a 40% survival rate in mice infected with a fatal dose of salmonella typhi murium is very difficult. It is important to stress that the mice were not given any chemical substances or medication; there were no factors that might act perhaps in one way, perhaps in another. And so we have established that the pyramid itself affects the living organism. Now we need too study the mechanism by which it does so.” (See “Appendix 9” on page 68 )"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"The Wands of Horus The Results Of Research Into The Effect Of Pyramids . 35 Third Edition - December 2001 A.S. Kotosonov, Doctor of Physical & Mathematical Sciences, Graphite Scientific Research Institute “I was highly sceptical regarding the effect of the pyramid on the physical and chemical properties of non-organic materials. We therefore decided to resolve the question with a many-sided approach. We used the whole arsenal of methods available in our laboratory to evaluate the effect, or lack of it, of the pyramid on the physical properties of carbon materials. We chos e for the purpose a specific material known as quasi-two-dimensional graphite. To put it simple, this is high-temperature pyrolytic carbon, highly textured and precipitated on a hot liner at 2000°C. “Its highly pronounced two-dimensional structure leads to it having a mundane and generally understood property — electrical conductivity — th at is not affected by such powerful energetic influences as neutron radiation. Neutron radiation as high as 10 19 neutrons/cm 2 (and even more) produces no significant change in the electri cal conductivity of a material like quasi-two- dimensional graphite. “It seemed to us that if neutron radiation has no substantial effect on electrical conductivity, then the mysterious pyramid was hardly likely to influence it. As a consequence, we were terribly surprised, but it is a fact — experiments on electri cal conductivity carried out in our laboratory by Sergei Kuvshinnikov demonstrated that conductiv ity does change, by a factor of several times. More than that, the infl uence of the pyramid depends on the time of day when the samples were placed in the pyramid and when they were take n out. The changes in electrical properties, conductivity in particular, followed a periodic law, and the amplitude of these oscillations depended on the length of the pyramid’s influe nce and the time when the samples were removed from the pyramid.” (See “Appendix 10” on page 69 ) V.I. Kostikov, Academician of the Academy of Natural Sciences of the Russian Federation, Director of the Graphite Scientific Research Institute “It may even be not a bad thing that our science finds itself in such a difficult position, because the people left in it are obliged, under conditions of poor material stimulation and poor supply, to think very well. And in the problem we are examining today our task is to bring in the best people so that tomorrow’s technology will be founded on new principles and new capital-intensive investments. I should like to stress the idea that hitherto in all forms of technology we have had four variable parameters: temperature, pressure, time and concentration. Now, perhaps I am being hasty, possibly I am leaping to conclusions that are too bold, but to those variable parameters in technology we can add a fifth — the pyramid, with all consequences deriving from that. This is despite the fact that the method by which it operates is still the subject of debate and theoreticians will be working for a long time yet on how to put it to practical use. Still, the existence of this fifth parameter gives us the opportunity to obtain new results in practically all forms of chemical, metallurgical and other technologies. “Now it is possible to state boldly that this is the technology of the twenty-first century. And the further we advance, the more we will feel th e influence of informatio n on the technological process, and most importantly we will use it, since we sense all these things from the depths of antiquity. There are very many facts indicating that these factors have influenced events, people, decisions taken, and so on.

That is the most fundamental difference. Previously we knew it , se nsed it purely empirically, but today we have the opportunity, by introducing this factor, to vary the end result. This is, I believe, the coming technical revolution, one that will be unparalleled in human history. (See “Appendix 11” on page 70 ) “That is to say that there is real, concrete data that cannot be denied. .... Here in our laboratory, incidentally, we demonstrated our results to some of the country’s foremost material scientists, specialists in the fields of aviation materials, powder metallurgy, semiconductors and electronics. They were the directors of leading institutes who visited Egypt together with me. We showed them these results. Despite the fact that they are all, if you’ll excuse the expression, hard- bitten materialists, they left the place inspired, with the understanding that here we have come into contact with the great invisible, but not on the level of psychics, soothsayers and magicians, but on the level of measurable quantities and variable effects. “In conclusion, I should direct your attention to the fact that a person holding the Wands of Horus is also under the influence of the pyramid, but it is an indirect influence, by way of water, atmospheric electricity, and also the Wands of Horus that are linked to the pyramids by resonant interaction.” Today we have just slightly opened the door to one more secret that will help people to see the true level of the Ancients’ knowledge and take one more step towards an understanding of the history of the previous civilisation. Several thousand years had to pass, before we again succeeded in discover ing the secret of the reasons behind the construction of the pyramid complex at Giza, which is only a part of a whole system embracing a once immense territory from the Pacific basi n through Eurasia to the shores of the Atlantic. Irrespective of which particular civilisation, Hyperborean or Atlantean, was the source of this knowledge, it is evident that this knowledge did not help to change the course of history. Ancient Egypt suffered the same fate as many other civilisations before and after. It was not the knowledge that was responsible, but those who possessed that knowledge, people who were in one way or another motivated by personal interests and not those of mankind as a whole . This led to the breakdown of basic ethical principles and, consequently, to degradation and oblivion. Recognition of this will, in turn, help you to sort out the sources of today’s problems and to see what lies ahead for us. We are still only at the beginning of the road and we hope that the knowledge that is returning to people will be carefully analysed and not used for harmful ends, and also that all ethical aspects will be taken into account, since ignoring them is the chief cause for the present state of our civilisation . The present book contains the relatively small amount of information that will allow you to form an initial picture of the knowledge of the Ancients. More complete information about the make-up of human beings, the pyramids, energy complexes and what lay behind the knowledge of the Ancients, invisibly guiding the world, will be provided in a larger publication that is currently in preparation."},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"The Wands of Horus Instructions for using the Wands of Horus . 37 Third Edition - December 2001 Instructions for using the Wands of Horus In this section we shall describe how to use the Wands of Horus . It also incorporates all the indications for their use to be found elsewhere in the book. This will help you to concentrate on the basic nuances regarding th e use of the cylinders and to find answers to frequently asked questions. Remember that the copper cylinder should be held in the right hand, the zinc one in the left. It is recommended that you remove all metal objects (jewellery, watches) while working with the cylinders. N.B. The cylinders can be used in a sitting or lying position as well as standing. At the start you should use cylinders with two types of filling. This is due to the general unpreparedness and unsatisfactory state of the energy system in the majority of people, something reflected in the illnesses that dog us. Therefore in the initial, preparat ory phase to improve the general state of the body’s energy system and taking into account the most frequently occurring problems, we suggest cylinders with a filling of carbon and ferro-magnetic material and others with a quartz filling. The table below indicates some basic differences that should be considered when selecting the type of cylinders. Both types of cylinder are effective for ■ Prevention of atherosclerosis ■ Diseases connected with poor circulatio n (including certain forms of impotence) ■ Possible relief in cases of spasms in the alimentary canal; some relief in cases of arthritis and back pain (osteochondrosis and radiculitis) without elimination of the causes Both types of cylinders have a positive influen ce on blood vessels and the cardio-vascular system, but their effects vary. The effect of the Wands of Horus Kont is strong and forceful, an impulse capable of getting an established problem moving. Those suffering from low blood pressure should be careful when using this type of cylinder as they lower blood-pressure. Coupled with low atmospheric pressure use by those with such a condition may lead to a circulatory collapse with all the consequences . On the other hand, for those with high blood-pressure, these cylinders filled with carbon and ferro-magnetic material may be an invaluable aid. The Wands of Horus Quartz have other properties. They are ve ry good for guarding against cardio- vascular diseases, nervous depressions and many othe r illnesses, but may prove inadequate against such conditions in the acute phase.

Nevertheless, it is worth stressing once again that the greater part of our illnesses begin with disharmony between two fundamental flows of energy — the BA and KA or Yin and Yang. Daily work with the cylinders ( for no less than two hours ) has a beneficial effect in cases of: ■ over-agitation and nervous disorders ■ problems with arterial pressure ■ vegeto-vascular disorders They also: ■ normalise the functioning of the heart in cases of arrhythmia and neuroses ■ improve circulatory processes, with a beneficial effect on blood vessels ■ ease pain in the joints in cases of arthritis and gout The Wands of Horus can be recommended for those suffering from: ■ cardio-vascular diseases ■ high blood pressure at an early stage ■ neurotrophic disorders ■ excretory diseases ■ insomnia, and also to relieve stress and help prevent atherosclerosis Contra-indications for the use of the cylinders: ■ Schizophrenia and other psychological disorders ■ Epilepsy ■ Pregnancy (in the last six months) These contra-indications apply to both types of cylinder, but particularly to those filled with carbon and ferro-magnetic material. If you do not have pronounced problems with your blood pressure then you can successfully use either type of cylinder, depending on the task you have set yourself. For most people the best times to work with the cylinders are: ✟ As they have a beneficial effect on the nervous system Wands of H orus Kont (carbon and ferro-magnetic filling) will always encourage deeper sleep. The Wands of H orus Quartz , while also having a strong anti-stress effect, nonetheless possess one important peculiarity. If you take them in your hands late at night when you already feel like sleeping in a few minutes you will feel wide awake. The Wands of Horus Quartz have a positive effect on the nervous system stimulating activeness. This effect produces stabilisation of blood pressure in those suffering from low blood pressure. Table 4: Times to Work with Cylinders Condition/Aim Time Recommendations & Explanations 1 Stress of various kinds Any time If you are suffering from nervous agitation, your organism’s first reaction to the influence of the cylinders will be a desire to sleep. Don not fight this. You should set everything aside and lie down.

It is best to stand bare-footed. This improves the energy-exchange and metabolic processes in the organism. 1. The use of the Wands of Horus in combination with hallucinogenic or narcotic substances, as well as strong alcoholic drinks, is not r ecommended. The results may be unpredictable. 2. It is not recommended to use the Wands of Horus close to a working television, ✞ computer monitor, microwave oven or other devices producing radiation. Using the Wands of Horus activates the body’s energy centres ( chakras ). On the one hand, in a natural setting the activation of the chakras enables them to absorb the energy flow at a higher intensity, up to 40% of their capacity. On the other hand, you should remember that the opening of the chakras makes it easier for harmful radiation to enter the organism. You should take this factor into account when choosing a time and place to work with the cylinders and plan your day accordingly. The same applies to people living in zones of higher radioactivity or working in places where there are powerful electric fields. The consequen ces of working with the Wands of Horus in such places can be highly unpredictable. ✞ This warning applies to televisions and monitors with a cathode-ray tube. When using the cylinders try to keep at least 5 metres (16 feet) away from such devices. The cylinders can be safely used alongside liquid crystal displays and projection televisions. 3. Those with low blood pressure must bear in mind that when using the Wands of Horus Kont in the run-up to unfavourable days (geomagnetic storms), they should not take on an immoderate amount of work. It is not advisa ble for them to immediately drive a car or operate machinery due to the likelihood of drowsiness. Such drowsiness is the natural result of the Wands of Horus affecting the nervous system and the wider organism. During the ensuing sleep the organism transforms the energy it has received and when you awake you will feel particularly alert. A slight feeling of dizziness is possible immediat ely after a session. In this event, you should, if at all possible, lie down and relax. There is not cause for concern as the feeling soon passes. 4. When working with the Wands of Horus it is desirable to shut your mind off from thoughts that cause you stress. The cylinders activate d eep-going processes connected with the mind. To engage in a session while preoccupied w ith stressful experiences can provoke dizziness. 5. Diabetics should note that working with the Wa nd s of H o rus Kont can lead to shifts in blood sugar levels of 2–3 units. This is particularly important for people who have ever been in a diabetic coma and the elderly. Continued work with the Wands of Horus will encourage the stabilisation of blood sugar levels. 6. Those with kidney and gall stones, particularly when the condition is exacerbated, should note that by stimulating the circulation the Wands of Horus may provoke the abrupt expulsion of gravel and stones. 7. Women should not use the cylinders when menstruating. 8. During periods of abrupt change in atmospheri c pressure, stress or physical overload some unusual conditions may arise when people with energy canals located close to the surface work with the cylinders. Such sensations if they do arise will occur in the first minutes of a session, after which everything normalises itself. 9. “Electrically charged” people — those who pr oduce mild electrical discharges when they touch other people or objects — may experien ce a certain sense of over-excitement when working with the cylinders. In this case they should take a cool shower before working with the cylinders or after such feelings arise."},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"The Wands of Horus Instructions for using the Wands of Horus . 40 Third Edition - December 2001 Various negative sensations may arise when working with the Wands of Horus if a person has certain blockages of the energy canals an d dystrophic decompensation. In this case correction, a diet or cleansing is necessary. 10. You should pay particular attention to the state of your spine. Since functionally the spine is inseparably connected with the activity of a person’s energy structure, its condition determines not only the state of a whole number of organs and the organism’s life-support system. The state of the spine also dete rmines your sensitiv ity and receptivity. Osteochondrosis blocks your organism’s energy exchange system. One of the symptoms pointing to this is the temperature of hands and feet. If they are cold that suggests that the main energy column (the spine) is blocked This is one of the causes of a complete lack of sensations when using the Wands of Horus . Besides, low hand temperature means the cylinders are not warmed sufficie ntly and do not reach the necessa ry level of activity. In some instances when working with a psychic healer a person with osteochondrosis may experience acute discomfort. Consequently, we strongly r ecommend you to pay attention to the state of your spine. After you tackle that problem, you may find the doors to absolutely new states opening up to you. (See “Appendix 12” on page 72 ) 11. Some unpleasant sensations may arise in people with serious disruptions to bilateral symmetry. 12. Briefly about bilateral symmetry: In a normal person’s organism the nodes of the energy canals running through the body should precisely coincide with the acupunctu re points. Serious diseases such as cancer, Bekhterev’s disease (ankylosing spondylitis), and a number of others cause the nodes to shift away from the acupuncture points. That is not the sole reason for such a shift, however. Other causes can be hidden in a person’s genetic ma ke-up or in the process of developing other health disorders. Therefore in some circumst ances bilateral asymmetry requires appropriate correction, which should be performed by a specialist. 13. During and immediately after a stroke users shou ld pay particular attention to the sensations they experience when working with the Wands of Horus . As has already been stated the cylinders encourage blood circulation. 14. People with persistent high blood pressure should start working with the cylinders gradually, paying careful heed to their sens ations and remembering that the Wands of Horus Kont have a powerful impulsive effect. 15. In selecting which cylinders to use, remember that you must take your blood pressure into account. The Wands of Horus Kont reduce blood pressure, but it is important to bear in mind that they reduce it to the norm determined by the genetics of the organism itself. Therefore, when deciding whether your blood pressure is high or low you should not just follow charts. In some people the blood-pressure-meter may show a level lower than the standard norm, but if they have had low blood pressure from childhood their organism has long-since adapted to it and such a level is effectively normal for them. The same applies to people with higher-than-standard readings. You should be guided by the direction in which sudden shifts of pressure occur. If you have had low blood pressure all your life according to the charts, but at times of change it rises that means that your blood pressure is in fact inclined to soar and not to drop. In which case you should begin working with the Wa nd s o f H o rus Kont . If you have had high blood pressure all your life according to the charts, but at times of change it falls that means that your blood pressure is in fact inclined to drop. In which case (if such shifts of blood pressure upset you) you should begin working with the Wands of Horus Quartz . They encourage a rise in blood pressu re to the genetically determined norm. If you do not have problems with blood pressure, then you can use both types of cylinder, without fear of unpleasant sensations on that score. 16. Irrespective of the filling, the Wa nd s o f H o rus are a tool for individual use. When held in the hands, participating in the creation of a “prani c cocoon” that corrects processes taking place in the organism, the Wands of Horus remember the frequency dictated by the hypothalamus"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"The Wands of Horus Instructions for using the Wands of Horus . 41 Third Edition - December 2001 and hypophysis. That distinctive vibration is like a person’s individual code. The memory process is highly specific. It is this individual vibration interacting with the crystal that makes it (the crystal structure) resonate, setting the rhythm that your organism needs at that given moment. After you put the cylinders aside they will continue to vibrate at your frequency for some time. The persistence of this memory depends on a person’s energy qualities. If a person has an ordinary level of energy potential, the cylinder’s will “remember” his or her individual frequency for a matter of hours. A powerful energy potential can leave a memory that lasts for several months. In principle it is possible to pass the Wands of Horus to someone else, but we do not recommend using them immediately. They should be left to lie for at least two hours so that the individual frequency set by the first user’s or ganism has time to dissipate. If you pick up cylinders vibrating with someone else’s frequency then the “pranic cocoon” they create will also vibrate with a “foreign” frequency. To acceler ate the process of dissipation, it is best to place the cylinders in cold running water. 17. It should be especially stressed that in order to obtain a deep corrective, therapeutic effect immediately after a session with the Wands of Horus you should, whenever possible, lie down and relax, even better go to sleep. It is during this period of relaxation or sleep that the organism transforms the energy received and when you awake you will feel particularly alert. 18. Working with the cylinders is very useful for women going through the menopause. 19. When working with all varieties of the Wands of Horus with the aim of developing and improving your energy structure and psychic capacities it is necessary to take account of your own individual annual cycle of rising and falling energy activity. The best results in self- correction and self-improvement will be achieved only in the ascending period. As for healing, the treatment of patients with serious diseases during the descending period may lead to negative results, including perhaps the loss of energy potential and disease on the part of the healer himself or herself. The loss of energy potential can lead to the appearance of serious health problems and the onset of degenerative processes. For information on individual annual cycles contact us at: P.O.

This is important because th e link between metal and hand is tightly bound up with the functions of the left and right hemispheres of the brain. All external and internal dimensions of the Wands of Horus conform strictly to the proportions of the Golden Section. This is of fundamental importance for the existence of resonant interaction between the cylinders and the user. To work effectively the Wands of Horus need to attune themselves to the organism, while the user’s organism for its part should also attune itself to the Wands of Horus . Such interaction is only possible when th e cylinders conform to the proportions of the Golden Section. (See “Appendix 1” on page 47 ). The copper and zinc used to produce the cylinders are of high quality. The zinc has a purity of no less than 99.96% with a minimal lead content. \"Cylinders of the Pharaoh\" are filled with carbon and ferromagnetic material in the form of powder or tiny crystals. The effectiveness of the \"Wands of Horus\" produced by the International Ufology Research Information Centre is increased by using carbon and ferromagnetic material in the form of \"cores\" inserted into the cylinders, the carbon in the copper one, the ferromagnetic material in the zinc one. Drawing on Ancient Egyptian tradition, (37 ) this type of cylinder has been given the name Wands of Horus Kont . The ferromagnetic material should have a relatively low magnetic induction value. The regular value of the magnetic induction maximums is 10±2 millitesla. The highest value of magnetic induction maximums is about 47 microtesla. The filling used for the Wands of Horus Quartz is a special white quartz, fine-grain, large-grain or monocrystalline. The choice of crystal size depends on the aims being pursued (31 ). Any height (length) can be chosen for the cylinder, although its should be noted that in ancient times the height of the cylinder, like the height of the Pyramid of Cheops, were not chosen at random. For example, the height of that pyramid (146 metres) is roughly equal to one-thousand-millionth of the distance from the Earth to the Sun. It was also co nnected with the period of the basic Sothis cycle (38 ), 1460 years, which was divided up into smaller units of 1460 days — the Egyptian year cycle. Therefore the height of Wands of Horus attuned to the pyramid and to this cycle may be 146 millimetres. But, bearing in mind that the Pyramid of Cheops has been damaged, the wands should be attuned to the whole complex. It that event, the height of the Wands of Horus will be equal to 151.4 millimetres. To increase the effectiveness of the Wands of Horus all the components from which the cylinders are made are exposed in a pyramid with a powerful structuring field (39 ), to correct the inter-atomic distances, for a period of at l east twelve days (and nights). We are certain that in the near future cylinders will come to occupy the place they deserve in the life of almost every person. Therefore it is extremely im portant that the public knows as much about the cylinders as possible. Correct and extensive information will help people to use the cylinders as effectively as possible. Regrettably, in our business-minded age, the gr owing public awareness of the cylinders of the pharaohs has awakened interest in the commercial possibilities. New publications are appearing that present the knowledge of the Ancients in new, not always correct ways. The lack of necessary information and incorrect use of the cylinders can lead to negative results. In this context the International Ufology Resear ch Information Centre continues to receive many letters and telephone calls inquiring what the difference is between the Wands of Horus and the \"means of acting on the human organism marketed under the name Zhezli sily or \"or \" Wa n d s o f Po w e r \" in English. Drawing on the knowledge embodied in the monuments of Ancient Egypt and presented above, we should point out a number of basic, fundamental differences. The \"Wands of Power\" have a number of substantial constructional defects. The sizes and proportions of the \"Wands of Power\" do not conform to the principle of the Golden Section, which almost completely excludes the possibility of them attuning themselves to the human organism."},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"The Wands of Horus The Construction & Basic Parameters of the Wands of Horus . 43 Third Edition - December 2001 The metal from which the “ Wands of Power ” has an unjustifiably high lead content, which in itself is a danger to health. The greatest danger, however, comes from their high level of magnetic induction. Powerful permanent magnets have been placed inside each of th e rods, in the middle and at the ends, and as a result the regular value of magnetic induction maximums in the “ Wa n d s o f Po w e r ” is 30±4 millitesla, while the peak value is 42 millitesla. (Measurements by the scientific research and production facility Sensor ). This is almost four times the maximum level of magnetic induction laid down in Soviet Ministry of Health standards of 16 August 1977. We include the Ministry normative document as an appendix. (See “Appendix 13” on page 73 ) The use of cylinders with such a high level of magnetic induction leads to bilateral and general bio- energetic asymmetry. Effectively this is a time-bo mb. When examining the human energy system, we repeatedly mentioned the canals that run through the whole of a person’s energy system. In principle and in essence, the extensive network of energy canals is an absolute copy of the circulatory system, since the first energy layer ( the ethereal body) contains within it the matrix (40 ) of the circulatory system. The highly-branched system of energy canals that plays an extremely important role in the organism's vital activities, has a large number of junctions or nodes that should precisely coincide with their projections on the human body, what are known as the \"acupuncture points\". The use of the “ Wa n d s o f Po w e r ” with their high level of magnetic induction leads to a shift of the energy framework in respect of the acupuncture points that can subseq uently lead to the most unpredic table consequences, including the most serious diseases. Suffice it to say that the development of such grave illnesses as Bekhterev’s disease or cancer is bound up with the displacemen t of the energy nodes away from the acupuncture points. This displacement is described as b ilateral and general bio-energetic asymmetry. The use of cylinders with a high magnetic induction is justified in certain cases of cancer of the internal organs, where a positive effect may be obtained by destabilising the growth of the tumour, but even then, after growth has been stopped, the side -effects may be extremely unpredictable. The use of the “ Wands of Power ” may produce a breakdown of the nervous system, not only in a sick person, but even in a healthy one, and also l ead to mild psychological disorders. A few words need to be said about the fillings as well. As we have already said the influence of cylinders filled with carbon and ferromagnetic material encourages the lowering of blood pressure. Quartzites, on the other hand, stimulate the organism, encouraging a rise in blood pressure to the genetically determined norm. The filling of the “ Wa n d s o f Po w e r ” consists of quartzites, coal, graphite and ferromagnetic material and so simultaneously encour ages blood pressure to rise and fall. The effect of such an influence is hard to predict. In conclusion we would like to stress that the attempt to justify the choice of filling elements on the basis of links between particular minerals and stars is bound to fail as such links are conventions. It makes sense to bring to the read er’s attention the fact that the “ Wa n d s o f Po w e r ” owe their origins to a manuscript written by Comte Stefan Colonna Walewski We present the reader with an ex tract from the manuscript that wa s published in America in 1955. It contains a description of the method used in Ancient Egypt to strengthen the flows of energy in the body. The manuscript states, among other things, that cores were placed inside the cylinders and not a mixture of various minerals, while the collecti on of various minerals used in the “ Wands of Power ” contains some without the structure of quartz which makes th eir presence merely arbitrary.

The two rods are grasped in the hands of these standing figures, grasped with enormous force resembling electrical force (secondary electricity), and, when the hands themselves maintain the grip, they release this energy within the body in order to gather it in the unipolar nodes and cerebrospinal fluid. The regeneration of energy potential is 100% complete and lasts a day and a night, twenty-four hours. There were two rods and they were of different composition. One was usually intended for the right hand, the other for the left. One had the power of the sun, the other that of the moon. The solar rod of power consisted of specially prepared hardened carbon in which the structure of the molecules was changed in the sa me way that the structure of iron molecules changes when the iron is magnetised. (When iron becomes a magnet the structure of its molecules changes through the process of recrystallisation or hardening in the course of which the magnetic properties appear.) The hardening process consists of heating to a high temperature and then instantly cooling by plunging into water. (The ro ds of hardened carbon produced for electric arc lamps are eminently suitable as solar rods of power.) The prepared (hardened) carbon rod can be placed in a copper case open or closed at both ends. (The length of the rod is six inches, the diameter one inch, or matched to the grip of the hand.) Rod of hardened carbon (solar) The lunar rod of power consists of a piece of hardened magnetite or pressed magnetite. (It may also be of non-magnetic hardened iron or magnetic steel.) The lunar rod of power can be inserted in a zinc or tin casing, open or closed at both ends. (Length and diameter are the same as for the solar rod.) Rod of hardened magnet (lunar) The lunar rod serves as a catalyst, making the solar rod more active. Rods of power were known and used even in the remotest times and the secret of how to make them was known to a few initiates. The mysterious metal (bronze) AURICALCUM has astonishing strength and consists of five metals, each of which has a particular colour — white, black, red, blue and yellow. It is radio- active and conceals within it the secret of the immaculate conception. (The proportions of the metals are equal.) Pose from the EGYPTIAN MASTER SYSTEM for the regeneration of nervous energy. (One should be relaxed and keep track of the sun.) Then comes an electrode made of gold and silver (40% gold and 60% silver), then a combination of 75% silver and 25% zinc, a combination of copper and zinc and also copper and tin. (Many combinations of bronze can be obtained, calculating the relationships and properties of the planets.) The sun is gold; the Moon silver; Saturn lead; Jupiter tin; Mars iron; Venus copper and Mercury mercury. The same applies to minerals — carbon, magnetite, beryl, amber, tourmaline, rock crystal, haematite, and so on.”"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"The Wands of Horus The Construction & Basic Parameters of the Wands of Horus . 45 Third Edition - December 2001 In conclusion we should like to stress that the inclusion of this section was prompted not by competitive considerations, but by a sincere conviction that the use of incorrectly made cylinders may lead to the most unpredictable consequences. That in turn may lead to a wave of negative reaction against the cylinders in general and lead to the di screditing of the very subject. We for our part are convinced that within a year, two or three cylinders will appear in many homes, providing invaluable help in the fight against disease and the improvemen t of the immune system.

In order to better picture the mechanisms operati ng in the great pyramid complex at Giza, let us examine an easily understood example. Take two guita rs and tune them in unison. Then put one of the guitars in the next room, come back, pick up the othe r and strike a note — on the sixth, thickest string, say. If you do that, you will observe that the sixth string of the second guitar, standing in the corner of the other room, has also begun to vibrate, producing a barely audible note, although you have not touched it. That is the physical phenomenon of harmonic resonance in action. The pyramid, being at one and the same time both an antenna and a resonator, is a re-transmitter of certain energy flows connected with processes taking place in the cosmos, flows that are in turn focused on the “Energy Source” within the pyramid. The Wands of Horus that the priests and pharaohs used, the concentrators worn on the head, the “Energy Source” within the pyramid, the pyramids themselves and much else besides was created in accordance with the proportions of the Golden Section, which was the precondition for all the objects being attuned to one another (in unison, as it were). It should be remembered that all the physical and energy structures of the human being are su bject to the laws of the Golden Section. Consequently, everything made by nature or constructed by mankind in accordance with that principle is “attuned” to everything else. Therefor e when the energy flow acts on the “Energy Source” inside the pyramid, the structure of the pyramid amplifies that effect. The effect extends not only to people and objects located inside the pyramid. It extends over a very large area beyond as a result of which cylinders being held in the hands begin to “ring”, or resonate like the sixth string of the guitar in the next room. In th is way the energy is tran smitted over a distance and the energy reaching the “Energy Source” in the pyramid is transferred to people and to the cylinders in their hands. (See “Appendix 14” on page 74 )"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"The Wands of Horus . 48 Third Edition - December 2001 Appendix 2 The Westcar Papyrus His Majesty King Cheops spent all his time trying to find out the number of secret chambers of the sanctuary of Thoth, so as to have the same for his own “horizon” [pyramid] The Westcar Papyrus Every civilisation looks back into its past that has been preserved in myths, seeking to find divine sources in it. The legends of Ancient Egypt recount that cosmic order and its reflection on the soil of Egypt were established very long ago by the gods, in the very first “Golden Age”, which was called Tep Zepi — roughly translating as “the first time”, when the gods dwelt on Earth and could converse with people. About 12,000 years ago, when the Atlanteans came to northern Africa, their development, knowledge and capabilities were so far above those of the local population that for them the Atlanteans were like gods in human form. [11 ] [15 ] The race of gods (Atlanteans) ruled Egypt for many centuries until, as a consequence of assimilation with the local population, power gradually passed to pharaohs who were perceived to be mortal, albeit of divine (Atlantean) ancestry. The pharaohs remained a li nk to the world of the gods and thus to the world that had existed in the “first time”. The Westcar Papyrus and the illustrations to the Book of the Dead (26 ) contain evidence relating to events that preceded the construction of the pyramid. They tell of Cheops’s striving to build his pyramid in keeping with knowledge (inherited from the gods) that would give the edifice special properties. It is evident that by the time the Great Pyramid wa s erected the main elements of the knowledge that the Egyptians had inherited from the Atlanteans had to a considerable extent been lost. The Westcar Papyrus implies that the reason behind Cheops’s desire to meet a sage named Djedi was prompted by the belief that Djedi knew “the number of secret chambers of the sanctuary of Thoth”. The number of chambers, or more precisely thei r location (within the body of the pyramid), is connected with principles founded on fundamental cy clical processes and general planetary constants. This was the very knowledge that formed the basi s of the most ancient Canon that the Egyptians inherited from the gods and in accordance with wh ich buildings were designed. The account taken of this knowledge in designing and constructinf the pyramid gives it special properties as a consequence of which unusual phenomena begin to be observed in the chambers of the pyramid. Some of these secret chambers contained special de vices (crystals and mirror reflectors) with the aid of which the priests of Atlantis “listened to the Universe”, obtaining wisdom from “Intercourse with the Gods”. It was a desire to be able to do the same th at prompted Cheops to spend so much time in seeking knowledge of the “secret chambers of the sanctuary of Thoth” — so as to make his own pyramid the same. Indeed what idea could have fired Cheops mo re strongly than that of building a pyramid containing the secret chambers of the ancient sanctuar y of the god of wisdom, if we bear in mind that wisdom came from “Intercourse with the Gods”? The papyrus text contains the words , which can be translat ed as: “(I know) the place where they are.” In this case, as is ev ident from the following question and answer, the ipwt of the sanctuary of Thoth is supposed to be in a flint box in one of the rooms of the temple at Heliopolis. Cheops asks whether Djedi knows the number of s ecret chambers in the sa nctuary of Thoth. Djedi replies: “Please, forgive me, I do not know their number, o King, my lord, but I know the place where it is... There is a box made of flint in the room called “the inventory” at Heliopolis; in that box [is what you seek].” A papyrus that has come down to us through the millennia contains information about the place where what the Egyptians inherited from the Atlant eans and what so interested the pharaoh Cheops was kept. As Professor Erman demonstrated, another word — sipty — was used to denoted the stocks that constituted the property of a temple. [19 ] Hence we can conclude that the word ipwt denotes a “secret chamber” and that Cheops wanted to learn the details of Thoth’s secret chamber so as to reproduce it when building his own pyramid. ( It is possible to surmise that the flint box held documents describing in detail the construction of “secret chambers”, or perhaps the “Energy Source” itself that was later"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"The Wands of Horus . 49 Third Edition - December 2001 installed in the Pyramid of Cheops. )From Professor Erman’s translation it is possible to conclude that the ipwt was small enough to fit in a box. A Mr Crum linked with this word the Coptic word that is associated with other words for “doors”, “bolts”, “keys” ( Zeitschrift für ägyptische Sprache , XXXVI, 147). Therefore it is possible to surmise that Cheops was looking for some kind of “doors” or “keys” to the wnt , the sanctuary of Thoth. The doors (or keys, in th is case it is a symbol for access) to the secret sanctuaries of Thoth. In the light of the above it is curious to note that as early as the end of the nineteenth century and the beginning of the twentieth C. Ford in the USA and Konstantin Tsiolkovsky and N. Rynin in Russia independently of each other expressed the idea that in the monuments from one of humanity’s oldest cultures traces should remain of visits and work done by representatives of an extraterrestrial civilisation. These true creators of the pyramids supposedly encode d in their creations information that even now, forty centuries on, will stagger mankind."},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"The Wands of Horus . 50 Third Edition - December 2001 Appendix 3 Illustration of Energy Projections of the Hypothalamus & Hypophysis One of the facts confirming and illustrating the existence of energy projections of the hypothalamus and hypophysis may come in the form of photographs taken during investigations into an incident that happened on the night of 8 January 1991 to Alexei Po pov, leader of the team of machine-operators at the Komintern collective farm in Sarai district of Riazan region (south-east of Moscow). That night he was performing his duties in the farm’s feed plant. Making the round of the yards, he got in his car and had driven about two metres when suddenly a narrow beam of white light from above appeared in front of the car. The engine stalled an d the cassette that was in the player was ejected. Stunned, Alexei glanced at his watch. It showed 3.15 a.m. And literally within seconds an object descended from above that somewhat resembled the relatively small, squarish vans used in Russia as ambulances but was very strange in having neither windows or doors. The object came down completely silently about ten metres from the car and — this stuck in Alexei’s mind — exactly on the junction of two local roads. Obeying his instinctive fear, the wi tness locked all the doors of th e car from the inside and became totally alert. A rectangular door came out from the object and then moved away to the side and out of the opening came a tall (about two metres) being in a dark, tight-fitting costume who looked like a man. The figure approached the car and as he did so the door locks sprang open by themselves. Coming up to the left- hand side of the car, he opened the door himself and spoke to the terrified driver who was clinging tightly to the steering-wheel in Russian, but with some strange accent. The figure and Alexei had a brief conversation, after which a woman of the same height came out of the object, approached the car on the opposite side, op ened the back door, glanced inside and returned to the object. “A second person is a hindrance. We should go away now and you will drive to the garage. A man with a tractor is waiting for you there,” the figure said and returned to the UFO. Three red lights appeared on the top of the object. Th e ship rose silently and disappeared. It was 3.20 a.m. Alexei started the car and drove off. On the way he did indeed meet a second person, Ufimov, on a horse, and at the garage the machine-operator Semion Mikhailov was waiting for him as he could not get his tractor to start. This incident was investigated by the Riazan Regional Committee for Anomalous Phenomena. A slightly raised level of radiation at the putative landing site (15 microröntgen against a background of 8mR) provided indirect support for the witness’s statement about its location. A most interesting aspect of the investigation was the results of photography carried out directly at the landing site. The photographs produced provided additional support for the witness’s identification of the landing site. In the picture it looks like a large dark patch behind the female figure’s back, although the spot was totally unremarkable to the naked eye."},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"The Wands of Horus . 51 Third Edition - December 2001 The most astonishing thing, though, was that the photograph recorded the presence of mysterious bright ve rtical columns of energy emanating from the heads of the people at the landing site when the photograph was taken. In order to make these columns more easily visible we provide a second version of the pho tograph with enhanced contrast. These “columns” are nothing other than the accidentally recorded energy projections of the hypothalamus and hypop hysis, on which the “crowns” of the Ancient Egyptian priests and pharaohs were focussed. It is remarkable too that in the photographs we can clearly see the shape of these structures that people relate to the 6th and 7th energy “shells”. In point of fact these energy structures do not have the shape of a “cocoon” or “shell” around the person’s body. They take the form of energy struct ures located around and ab ove the person’s head and surging upwards from it. Incidentally it is their height that determines the individual’s parapsychological capacities. These energy structures perform an extremely important function in the energo-informational interaction of the mind with the surrounding world. With their help a person can receive information from the Earth’s information field, and through th e Noosphere make contact with the information sources of other planetary systems. With the aid of these energy structures healers diagnose and treat their patients, sometimes even at a distance. Finally, w ith the aid of this energy canal that which people call God or the Creator interacts with us. It is this en ergy canal that is activated when a person addresses God and as a consequence there is a slight sensation of pressure in the centre of the palm, as that is the location of the energy projections of the 6th and 7th chakras (the hypothalamus and hypophysis). Already in ancient times it was noticed that regular repetition of a mantra (prayer) improves a person’s psychological and physical state. In other words, addressing God (consciously attuning oneself to God) produces a response in the form of a downward fl ow that also has a corresponding influence on a person’s psycho-physical structure. It should be noted that the influence of the resi dual field at UFO landing sites activates the human energy structure. There are a number of recorded cas es when people working at landing sites presented positive shifts connected with the opening of the capacity to see subtle field structures and the activation of sensory abilities. There are many known examples directly or indir ectly indicating the Ancients’ highly profound knowledge in the realm of natural science, parapsychology and the make-up of the human being. The horizons of their knowledge lie far beyond the bounds covered by modern-day science and today we rediscover what was well known to people in the dist ant past purely by chance. The photographs shown above are a good illustration of this, linking past and present, helping us to understand what has been obscured by the sands of time."},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"The Wands of Horus . 52 Third Edition - December 2001 Appendix 4 Shafts of the Great Pyramid There is no small body of evidence to prompt th e conclusion that the Ancient Egyptians did not construct the pyramids for the gr eater glory of their rulers.

Jane B. Sellers, The Deaths of Gods in Egypt One of the main reasons for the buil ding of the pyramids lay in the f act that those energy structures were used by the pharaohs and priests to obtain information about the past, present and future. The future has always concerned men’s minds, the more so if it was bound up with the fate of the ruler and the prospects of the state. We can find direct indications of this in Sothis , one of the original writings by Manetho, a high priest in the Egypt of the 3rd century B.C., which was saved for posterity by the Byzantine historian George Syncellus (about A.D. 800). ✟ Judging from this work, Ptolemy II Philadelphus (285–246 B.C.) was aware of Manetho’s extensive knowledge of the past and he inquired of the prie st whether he could “see something from the archives” and whether Manetho could “use his powe r of perception to predict the future.” In this context we should remind the reader of an event that caught the imagination of the whole world in the spring of 1993. At that time news ag encies reported a sensati on — the unknown engineer and robot technician Rudolf Gantenbrink ha d made the greatest discovery of the decade. In March that year Gantenbrink sent a miniature remote-controlled robot mounted with a video camera up the sout hern shaft of the \"Queen's Chamber\" in the Pyramid of Cheops. The machine was called UPUAUT-2, the \"opener of the ways\" in Ancient Egyptian. Advancing along the steeply-rising shaft, some 20 centimetres high and 23 centimetres wide, UPUAUT-2 reached a section lined with highly-worked Tura limestone usually only used for lining burial chambers and the like. At the end of this shaft the robot came up against a small door of solid limestone with two metal fittings. Immediately after the discovery several hypotheses were put forwards as to what might lie behind the door. But what is located there is not a statue of Osiris looking out towards the constellation of Sahu (Orion). The chamber does not contain the mummy of the pharaoh either. Behind the secret door Ga ntenbrink discovered there is a system of mirror reflectors that transform in a particular way the energy flow that once entered the “ventilation shaft” from the star Sirius towards which this shaft was directed (in about 2450 B.C.). This system, that has survived down to the present, is one of the last wonders of the surviving technological creations of the ancient Atlanteans that allowed the priests of Atlantis and Egypt to “listen to the Universe”. An indirect allusion to this technology is contained in one of Nostradamus’s predictions in which he states that “people will invent wondrous mirrors with the aid of which they will be able to talk and see each other over a great distance.” That technology already existed and, most probably, the system that will soon be discovered behind the secret door will spur the revival and further refinement of this technology."},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"The Wands of Horus . 53 Third Edition - December 2001 There are four such shafts in the Pyramid of Cheops and each of them at one time contained a system of this kind. But apart from the reflectors, at the points where the sh afts emerge on the surface special crystals were installed that received the radiation emanating from the stars (from different dimensions) while the system of mirrors located imme diately behind the crystal transformed that flow (41 ). For objective reasons, however, almost all th ese components were removed from the pyramid by priests who feared for devices that were not meant to fall into the hands of the uninitiated. After the Old Kingdom, roughly in the reign of Amenemhat I (about 1990 B.C.) the country experienced considerable political and social upheaval. This can be gathered from several well-preserved papyrus texts. The text is known to Egyptologists as “the ad monition of an Egyptian sage, Ipuwer” who was undoubtedly a priest of Heliopolis. It contains the bitter lament of a man who sees great turmoil at court and in the country. Perhaps it wa s a time of complete chaos as an yone could enter the temples once carefully guarded by the priests. S acred inscriptions were defaced; th e temples themselves were raided. Evidently at about this time all the crystals, mirror systems and a number of other devices were removed from the pyramid. Ipuwer’s text makes an unambiguous allusion to something hidden in the pyramid, suggesting that it is no longer there: “ that which the pyramid concealed has become empty... ” We should like to hope that the planned UN-supported attempt to penetrate beyond the door Gantenbrink discovered will not lead to the destruction of that system. It may begin to shed light on the subtleties of a unique technology and provide one fu rther piece of material evidence for the link between the Ancient Egyptians and the more highly developed civilisation, in some way dissimilar to us, of the Atlanteans. ✟ Manetho wrote a noted History of Egypt and, as a historian, he distinguished himself with the accuracy and reliability of his account. He not only wrote on historical matters but also left works on the mystical philosophy and religion of his country. It is generally considered that his works were the source of knowledge about Egypt upon which Plutarch and other later authors drew."},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"The Wands of Horus . 54 Third Edition - December 2001 Appendix 5 The King’s Chamber in the Great Pyramid “It is believed that the king was eventually buri ed in this last chamber [the “King’s Chamber”], which contains a large sarcophagus, but no remains of the king’s mummy or his funeral goods have been found and it is assumed that the pyramid was looted.” [4 ] An analysis of the geometry and dimensions of th e passage leading to the “burial chamber” and of the sarcophagus itself leaves no doubt that the sarcophagus was installed in the chamber when this level of the pyramid was being constructed, To carry the sarcophagus in through the Grand Gallery after the pyramid was complete would have been impossible, since its dimensions exceed those of the passage leading to the chamber. This fact alone is sufficient for us to guess that the chamber and the sarcophagus itself were elements of an overall design, well th ought out and planned in advance. Mathematical calculations have shown that the position of the chamber within the body of the pyramid, its proportions and the location of the sarcophagus were not coincide ntal. In the designer’s conception the room in question had a special intended function and was neve r conceived as the resting-place of the pharaoh’s mummy. The study of writings surviving from ancient times leaves increasingly less room for doubt that the knowledge embodied in the architecture and religio us conceptions of Ancient Egypt had at one time been inherited whole from another, more ancient and more advanced civilisation. Reference to this can be found in a passage from the works of Manetho in which he relates how back before the Flood Thoth set down in hieroglyphs (the sacred writing) on steles (and tablets) the principles of all ancient knowledge. Much later a descendant of Thoth translat ed those hieroglyphs into the language of ordinary people. That cosmic knowledge included an explanation of the place and role of our planet in the solar system a conception, wrapped up in myths, of the ev olution of the Universe, th e structure of the human organism and all that exists (the KA-BA principle) and also information about the potential of the human mind, the structure of the solar system, the basics of calculating cyclical processes, a map of the stars, and much else besides (42 ) In their book entitled The Orion Mystery , Robert Bauval and Adrian Gilbert produce persuasive calculations to show that at the time the Pyramid of Cheops was completed each of the two pairs of “ventilation shafts” running from the “King’s Chamber” and the “Queen’s Chamber” were precisely oriented on particular stars. The southern shaft of the “Kings Chamber” pointed to Al Nitak (Zeta Orionis), the northern shaft to Alpha Draconis; while the southern shaft of the “Queen’s Chamber” was directed towards Sirius, and the northern shaft to Beta Ursae Minoris. At one time special crystals were fitted at the point where the shafts come out to the surface. These crystals and the systems of mirror reflectors (one of which has survived and is located behind the door discovered by Gantenbrink) used to receive and tran sform the energy flow em anating from the stars to which the shafts were pointed. Then the transformed flow came down the shafts into the room where the sarcophagus stood."},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"The Wands of Horus . 55 Third Edition - December 2001 On a p articular day the priest or pharaoh lay down in the sarcophagus, and the indentation on the bottom of it in the shape of a human figure oriented his body in such a way that his head (the hypothalamus and hypophysis) were at the focus of the energy field inside the pyramid. The precise astronomical calculations performed by the priests enabled them to identify in advance the days on which the pharaoh or priest should take his place in the sarcophagus. On the appointed days the “Energy Source” within the pyramid was activated. The activation of the “Source” was the re sult of an increase in energy at the core of the planet caused by increase d solar activity and the gravitational interaction of the planets in the solar system. Precise calculations were needed becau se at the moment when the Earth’s core became more active the flow of en ergy coming from inside the planet excite the lattice of the “Energy Sour ce” crystal and the “Source” in turn distorted space in the vicinity of the pyramid. The flows of energy coming down the shafts from the stars were amplified by the pyramid and focussed on the (energy projections of the) hypothalamus and hypophysis resulting in an ex perience of “Intercourse with the Gods”. In other words, the person’s consciousness was connected to the Noosphere and the Earth’s information systems. This process was accompanied by a sensation of “leavi ng the body”, flying in the endless expanse of space, visiting other planets and contact with the energy “prints” (KA) of people who had already died (43 ), and sometimes also with representatives of ot her planetary systems to wards which the pyramid shafts were directed. Contact with the Noosphere and with members of highly advanced extraterrestrial civilisations (who were taken for gods) provided the opportunity to obtain information about the past and present as well as the possible prospects for the futu re. On the one hand through such contact the creators of the pyramids learnt about the world and the nature of things, on the other the idea of building the pyramids was put into people’s heads so that ther e might be a certain degree of influence through the pyramids (antennae) on the minds of those who, in turn, could influence the course of history and evolutionary processes on Earth. An analysis of the Ancients’ level of knowledge an d of the religious teachin gs that formed in the process of historical development leads to the unam biguous conclusion that at the foundation of the ancient way of looking at the world there was one subs tantial defect that ultimately determined the fate of not only Atlantis and Hyperborea, but also the Egyptian, Mayan, Toltec, Aztec and many other past civilisations. The errors inherited in those distant times have still not been recognised today, which accounts to a large extent for our current problems.(See “Appendix 15” on page 76 ) The level of knowledge acquired in ancient times clearly exceeded the moral and ethical level of those who possessed it. This is demonstrated by the fact that, while they had very profound knowledge in the fields of parapsychology, mathematics, astronomy, medicine (44 ), the Ancients engaged in sacrifice, murder (45 ) and wars of expansion. With knowledge of a high order at his disposal, a primitive man can do a great deal of damage, not only to himself. As practical evolutionary ex perience has displayed, the level of morality should correspond to the level of human abilities. It would be even better if the level of a person’s morality was higher than his or her abilities and technical achievements were the result of a rising level of spirituality in the true sense of that word (46 ). The situation that arose in those ancient times requir ed correction, that came about indirectly, that is to say, by the hands of the people themselves. In the history of the Egyptian, Mayan, Toltec, Aztec and many other past civilisations, the instrument of correction took the form of internal feuding and raids by neighbouring barbarian tribes that ended with the gradual extermination of those who possessed knowledge (47 ). Then, gradually, religion came to take the place of knowledge and fanatics of the new faiths burnt and destroyed whole libraries so as to affirm their piety. Ther efore the Ancient Egyptian priests and other surviving bearers of knowledge, caref ully concealed it so as to carry it down through the ages. Century followed century and with them the dyn asties ruling Ancient Egypt. True knowledge and the real meaning of the powerful practices gradually degenerated into legend and superstition, turning into a sort of “syndrome of power”. Thus the orig inal meaning contained in the knowledge was lost. The partly extant, considerably distorted knowledge that had its origins in the Golden Age “when the gods lived on the Earth” became the foundation of a state religious cult in which the pharaohs remained a link to the world of the gods and thus to the world that had existed in the “first time”. And"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"The Wands of Horus . 56 Third Edition - December 2001 while in the remote past Ba and Ka had been componen t elements of the human being, in the later period of Egyptian history the terms were associated with the attributes of power and might possessed by the rulers and gods. This is reflected in the Pyramid Texts, where the god Ra, for example, is said to have fourteen Kas. In order to illustrate the character of the changes that took place in pe ople’s thinking, let us return to the ancient knowledge, according to which Ba and Ka were two formative principles — opposite and united, different and homogenous at the same time. In constant proximity to the human being and interacting between themselves, Ba and Ka were two sources of vital energy. The harmonisation of Ba and Ka and their evolution gave rise to the Akh. The Akh is an intermediary between god and people or a lesser divinity capable of interpreting the messages of the gods. Early on, when discussing the true meaning of the con cept of the “Akh”, we stre ssed that it is in fact something more than just a person, but not, of course, a god. It is a human being with the ability to espy the future at certain moments and to predict it. In other words, the ancient knowledge indicated that conscious harmonisation of Ba and Ka enables a pe rson to develop the exceptional psychic and physical abilities necessary to understand oneself and the world around. When knowledge was succeeded by religion, the anci ent practices were transformed into “magic rituals”. The function of the “King’s Chamber” also changed. In the later religious philosophy of the Egyptians there are already three component elements. Ba and Ka are seen as two particles of the soul (48 ). The Ba and Ka remained inseparable from a person throughout his life, including the life beyond the grave. When a person died he received a third particle — the Akh. How, though, was it possible to become like the gods and acquire seven or fourteen Akhs, when a physical person dies only once? In order to reach that level and become god-like, or better to accord with his own divine origins, a pharaoh needed to “die” and be reborn. Such a feat was accomplished through a special initiation that the pharaoh went through several times during his life: on a particular day, accompanied by priests, he ascended the Grand Gallery leading to the chambe r and lay down in the sarcophagus. Here we should digress briefly and mention Ronald Moody’s book Life after Life (49 ), which contains the accounts given by people who have expe rienced clinical death. Practically all of those brought back to life by doctors said that when they died they left th eir bodies and looked down on them. Beyond that the stories varied, but many spoke of flying down a “corridor” (50 ), at the end of which they encountered a “divine light” (51 ). All those who had this experience remarked that their dead relatives came to them to advise them on ho w to react to what was taking place. A bird-man, symbol of the liberation of the soul (the leaving of the body) During the initiation (52 ) as a result of the influence of the pyramid, the pharaoh left his body in a symbolic death. The flight through space top the constellation of Sahu (Orion, towards which the southern shaft was directed) that followed symbolised a visit to the heavenly Duat. The return to the body represented the pharaoh’s resurrection (53 ). This ritual act of “death and resurrection” led to th e birth of an Akh. It was enough to perform this initiation fourteen times for the pharaoh to acquire fourteen Kas and fourteen Akhs. It should be stressed that the initiations conducted in the pyramids were full of the most extraordinary and at times truly singular experiences and visions. During the rite another unaccustomed world opened up before the pharaoh, one in which a person felt like a grain of sand and required appropriate help to react to the ev ents that were taking place. So, in order that the experience did not have a negative effect on the pharaoh’s psyche (54 ), the priests chanted or intoned the “texts of"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"The Wands of Horus . 57 Third Edition - December 2001 admonition” that guided the pharaoh during the initiation. With the help of these texts, imposed thought- images directed the pharaoh through a specific, pre-pr epared scenario. Immediatel y after the pharaoh left the body, the text pronounced in his name directed hi s attention to the sky and conducted him to the goal set by the initiation: '... The king, a Star brilliant and far-travelling... the king appears as a Star...' [Pyramid Texts, Utterance 262] The reed-floats of the sky are set in place for me, that I may cross by means of them to Ra (the rising sun) at the horizon. I ferry across that I may stand on the east side of the sky, when [Ra] is in [his] northern region among the imperishable stars, who stand at their staffs and sit at their east ... I will stand among them, for the Moon is my brother, the Morning Star is my offspring...' [Pyramid Texts, Utterance 1000–1]. 0 king, you are this Great Star, the Companion of Orion, who traverses the sky with Orion, who Navigates the (Duat) Netherworld with Osiris; you ascend from the east of the sky, being renewed in your due season, and rejuvenated in your due time. The sky has born you with Orion... [Pyramid Texts, Utterance 882–3] 0 king, the sky conceives you with Orion, the dawn-light bears you with Orion... you will regularly ascend with Orion from the eastern region of the sky, you will regularly descend with Orion in the western region of the sky...your third is Sothis... [Pyramid Texts, Utterance 820–2] 'The king has come that he may glorify Orion, that he may set Osiris at the Head...' [Pyramid Texts, Utterance 925] 'May you ascend to the sky, may the sky give birth to you like Orion...' [Pyramid Texts, Utterance 2116] Despite the fact the thousands of years have passe d since and the Great Pyramid has suffered a fair amount of damage, a person today can still experience the states that the pharaoh went through during the initiations. At a certa in time the “Source” becomes active, di storting space in the vicinity of the pyramid, and anyone who happens to be in th e pyramid at the time can become a witness to extraordinary phenomena. One such occurrence is desc ribed in print by the American researcher Alan Landsberg. “In September 1974 circumstances brought a youn g American couple, Patrick Flannagan and his fianc_e Eva Bruce, to Cairo where they headed for the pyramids imme diately on arrival. The next day Patrick and Eva returned there, but this time with an elderly one-eyed Arab guide with whom they agreed that they would spend the night inside the Gr eat Pyramid. The Arab was supposed to meet them in the morning. “Finding himself in total darkness, the young man switched on a powerful flashlight the bright beam of which was lost in the depths of the stone tunnel . Flannagan and his fiance stopped to get their breath back and then began the long climb to the King’s Chamber, the heart of the pyramid. ‘When we had reached the top of the Great Gallery,’ Flannagan recal led, ‘we glanced back. It seemed like the gallery disappeared into the depths of the Earth. The first thing that we began to sense were colored lights: blue, green, red and white. At the start I though that they were simply fireflies or the spots of light that can appear when the retina is excited. But what we were seeing were really balls of light that made no physical contact with our bodies. I could have stretched out my hand and touched those lights. Then we closed our eyes and began to sing. I sensed my body beginning to vibrate. Then I quickly got up and began to walk around the chamber. The lights disa ppeared. The candle cast irregular shadows on the ancient stones. Humming, I slowly circled around the King’s Chamber, from one wall to the other. When I passed by the sarcophagus, I sensed the mysterious processions that had once taken place here. I was no longer myself. Suddenly I had ceased to be Patrick Flannagan! I had changed. My individuality slipped from me like a mask and I sensed myself dissolving in the pyramid...’ “Then Patrick sat down on the granite blocks of th e floor. Now he was experiencing even stranger sensations. ‘I felt as if an electric current was running up and down my spine. It was painful, so painful that I fell into a sort of cataleptic trance.’ The vibration continued until the physically strong young man dropped from exhaustion."},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"The Wands of Horus . 58 Third Edition - December 2001 “Although he had read about instances of astral projection before, he had never experienced it himself. ‘I felt myself leaving my body, as if some outside force was controlling me. Then I found myself in a chamber hidden somewhere in the th ickness of the pyramid. The chamber had a vaulted ceiling and there was a pedestal in it. Resting on it was a heavy gold book with heavy gold pages on which unusual hieroglyphs were engraved. The outside was covered in human handprints. I had the distinct impression that if I were to put my hands on the pages of that gold book, information from the past would flow directly into my brain. When I really did it, then I felt a wave of energy flowing over me. Then I was thrown into the other co rner of the chamber. I noticed that there there was an entrance to the room in the form of a stone block that turned on its axis.’ “Flannagan was brought back by a deafeningly pain ful noise that stopped as quickly as it began. Then Eva and Patrick heard an indistinct chorus of male and female voices. ‘An ancient chant sounded for a time, but the words were completely unknown to me. I had never heard anything like that language.’ Then the singing gradually died away. Fl annagan felt pleasant vibrations in his spine and he was wrapped in a warmth that lasted through the night.” (55 ) [8 ]. (See “Appendix 16” on page 79 ) The room known as the “Queen’s Chamber” was also one of the chambers of the sanctuary of Thoth in which the Ancients obtained “wisdom” through “Intercourse with the Gods”. In the centre of the chamber stood a device, the mo st important part of which was two flat crystal quartz screens directed towards the en ds of the shafts pointing to Sirius and Beta Ursae Minoris. It would be more accurate to say that the energy flow emergi ng from the shafts was dir ected onto these screens. On a certain day, when the “Ene rgy Source” became more active producing a distortion of space, the priest (Akh) entered this chamber. On his head he wore a special diadem. He occupied a particular position (at the focus of the pyramid field) and fell into a special state in which he was able to “hear the Universe”. Between the quartz screens “three-dimensio nal holograms” appeared that only the hierophant with the diadem could see. The accompanying priests were unable to observe this. (See “Appendix 17” on page 81 ) The “Queen’s Chamber” was used to obtain info rmation. The distortion of space produced by the “Energy Source” made it possible not only to see, hear and converse with beings living in parallel dimensions, but also to hear and see what was taking place in a distant part of the world (Stonehenge, say). The history of the use of the pyramid structures in the course of the “development” of the civilisation can be divided into three basic stages. Stage 1. In the heyday of Atlantis and later when the Atlanteans who survived the catastrophe arrived in northern Africa, the pyramids were used as a means of communicatio n and a tool for gaining understanding. With the aid of the pyramid it became po ssible to do more than just improve the energy, and consequently psychic, capacities of the human being. The pyramids provided a unique opportunity to make “contact” with energy-based forms of life and to interact with representatives of extra terrestrial civilisations. The knowledge obtained in this way raised the capabilities of the Atlanteans who, in the eyes of the primitive peoples around them were like gods. In the process of degradation evoked by the br each of fundamental moral and ethical standards, partially preserved teachings passed down a somewh at distorted picture of how the ancient gods had lived and what they did. The second stage in the use of the pyramid was associated with the performance of certain initiation rituals intended to elevate the pharaoh to a level appropriate to his divine (Atlantean) origins. After the pharaoh lay in the sarcophagus the priests were responsible for more than just monitoring everything that happened to him after he “left the body” (“died”). They were supposed to direct the pharaoh, as almost any person in a suggestive (h ypnotic) state becomes a passive observer of events. Under the influence of the pyramid a person’s cons ciousness is linked to the information field and, receiving a complete picture of the world, that person is in a state of passive observation. The priest, by constantly pointing out the divine nature of the pharaoh, his affinity with the gods (with Osiris), helped the pharaoh to remain focussed on the main goal and to make an “as tral flight” to, for example, the constellation of Sahu (Orion)."},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"The Wands of Horus . 59 Third Edition - December 2001 The priest reciting the texts spoke in the name of the pharaoh and was like a voice expressing the will of the pharaoh as he observed the visions. 'The Winding Waterway is flooded, the Fields of Rushes are filled with water, and I [the dead king — i.e. having left the body] (56.) am ferried over thereon to yonder eastern side of the sky, to the Place where the gods fashioned me, where I was born new [reborn] and young . . . Lo, I stand up as a star which is on the underside of the sky ... my sister is Sothis, my offspring is the Morning Star . . .' [Pyramid Texts, Utterance 343-57] If there are no visions, but the person has entere d the hypnotic state, the voice of the “master-of- ceremonies” painting particular pictures may be able to invoke them. Therefore, directing the pharaoh’s attention to the heavens, the priest pronounced texts that formed particular images in the pharaoh’s mind so that what was happening to the pharaoh accorded w ith the scenario described in the texts. Thus by travelling the way of the gods, visiting the heavenly Duat and meeting them, the pharaoh did truly become god-like himself. '... The king, a Star brilliant and far-travelling... the king appears as a Star...' [Pyramid Texts, Utterance 262] '... behold he (the king) has come as Orion, Behold Osiris has come as Orion...' [Pyramid Texts, Utterance 820] '0 king, you are this Great Star, the companio n of Orion, who traverses the sky with Orion, who navigates the Duat with Osiris...' [Pyramid Texts, Utterance 882] 'The king has come that he may glorify Orion, that he may set Osiris at the Head...' [Pyramid Texts, Utterance 925] 'May you ascend to the sky, may the sky give birth to you like Orion...' [Pyramid Texts, Utterance2116] 'Live and be young beside your father (Osiris), beside Orion in the sky...' [Pyramid Texts, Utterance 2180] The Pyramid Texts also relate how, following the scenario, the priests led the pharaoh to an act of divine coition that filled the earthly presence of the pharaoh, his significance with a special meaning. In performing this act the pharaoh linked himself to the gods with special ties, filling his earthly purpose with that which the ancient legend aid about Isis and Osiris. 'Your sister Isis comes to you rejoicing for love of you. You [the dead King] have placed her on your phallus and your seed i ssued in her, she being ready as Sothis, and Har-Sopd has come forth from you as Horus who is in Sothis . . . and he (I) protect(s) you in his (my) name of Horus, the son who protects his father...' [Pyramid Texts, Utterance 632-3] In essence the Pyramid Texts are a “plot”, containi ng a “timetable” and the “addresses” of all the “beings” whom the pharaoh was supposed to meet “in the heavens” during his “astral flight”. The pharaoh could also have his own personal set of instru ctions and he needed to be prepared to change the programme and his own appearance depending at which he avenly “terminus” he arrived and to reflect in his own mind the meaning of the text spoken by the instructor-priest so as to react correctly to unfamiliar situations or to overcome the resistance of “hostile entities”. As experience in regressive hypnosis shows, the hardes t stage in the process, af ter the “leaving of the body”, is the moment when the subject should star t talking and describe the visions he sees. The hypnotist has to literally stimulate the person in the trance so that he opens his mouth and begins to produce words. It is highly likely that the appearan ce of the ritual of “opening the mouth” was connected with this."},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"The Wands of Horus . 60 Third Edition - December 2001 The third and final phase in the history of the use of the pyramid begins from the moment when they started to mummify pharaohs in Ancient Egypt. While in the period of the greatest flourishing of the Old Kingdom civilisation such things as mummification had not been heard of, by the time that ritual did appear, knowle dge about the practical use of the pyramid had been completely lost. Religion too had its influence on the fate of the ancient practice. Therefore all that modern Egyptology knows about the purpose of the pyramids is associated with the burial of the dead pharaoh. In accordance with the prevailing religious cults, the dead body, given the mummified form of Osiris, was placed in a burial chamber of rebirth, wh ere the soul began its transformation into a star. The preparation of the mummy was called sahu , the name Osiris had when he became lord of the Duat. It was believed that the rebirth of the mummy could not take place of its own accord, but required actions by the eldest son of the deceased, the new Horus-King who before his coronation was referred to as Horus the Elder. The ceremony this Horus had to perform was ca lled the “opening of the mouth”. It required the embalmed body of the dead father dressed in the regalia of Osiris to be raised to a vertical position and that a lotus bloom in all its glory be placed on a sm all stand before it. The lotus symbolised the “four sons of Horus” (the dead man’s grandsons) who, in turn, symbolised the “four cardinal points”. Wearing a hawk mask, Horus slowly approached the mummy, pi cked up a small metal instrument and struck open the mouth of the Osiris-King. The four sons , using their “fingers” (apparently made of bja ) ✟ assisted him in this ritual. [4 ] Thus the ancient knowledge was forgotten and toda y when speaking of the purpose of the pyramids Egyptologists say: “it is common knowledge that th e pyramids are the tombs of Egyptian pharaohs, they were erected to preserve their mummified bodies an d grave goods.” It is for that reason that many generations tried fruitlessly to find even one mummy in the pyramids. ✟ Although the pyramids were constructed before the Iron Age, the Egyptians of the time did know meteoritic iron. They called iron “bja” and, according to G.A. Wainwright (Journal of Egyptian Archaeology, 18, 1931), “meteorites consist of ‘bja’”. The word “bja” occurs repeatedly in the Pyramid Texts.

For comparison with the above, we also give a gr aph of sunspot activity in August each year, as sunspot activity also follows a four-year cycle. ☞ Many events making up human history are an indirect reflection of particular cyclical energy processes. Upsurges in energy activity are a subtle stimulating factor affecting each human being and thus humanity as a whole, prompting us to courses of action that determine the dynamics of historical processes. Taking on material form, these phenomena prompt humanity to actions that determine the outcome of historical processes. However, since “common sense” sometimes gains the upper hand over emotions, there may be a temporal shift of some particular historical event, or something that should take place does not. It is for this reason that in the first phase of a twelve- year cycle that should be marked by major events, we occasionally witness a shift of a year or two, or indeed the year becomes insignificant.

The rise of electromagnetic intensity which in the Pacific is giving rise to the El Niño current, a phenomenon that our scientists are unable to explain completely, is also bound up with a discharge of energy from the core. This is compounded by an ex ternal, cosmic factor. The electromagnetic field begins to resonate with processes (radiation) ta king place in space. Therefore the final phase of the relatively brief existence of this current is as a rule marked by unpleasant events, such as floods and tsunamis. Ethnic groups living in particular regions will lose their immunity to individual viruses due to the changing intensity of the Earth’s electromagnetic field. That is to say, diseases that previously passed off relatively easily, might become problematic, even fatal, not to mention serious diseases. Those with a predisposition to cancer are more likely to develop th e disease this year than last just because of the changes in the electromagnetic field. The greater electromagnetic intensity creates favour able conditions for the for the development of viruses and bacteria that will mutate. Perhaps this year mankind will encounter new forms of immune-deficiency syndrome in animals which will affect mammals and humans. To be more precise, some forms of the syndrome in mammals will affect humans as well. The influence of the cosmic factors mentioned above will have a fairly deleterious effect on mankind. Beginning to resonate with the energy fl ows coming in from space the Earth's electromagnetic field with its growing intensity will begin to interact resonantly with the ancient energy installations that exist on the planet (among them the Pyramid of Cheops). This will lead to certain deviations being observed in the human psyche. By itself the flow of energy coming in from the cosmos produces no result. It is neither positively or negatively charged as far as the human being is concerned — it simply makes a person do something. It is a sort of activity stimulator. A person's basic qualities begin to come out, the deep-lying inclinations that are at the heart of his nature. How that expresses itself is decided by the person himself. As a rule mankind goes down the path of least resistance. A low level of consciousness, the lack of a due degree of spirituality plus aggressiveness leads to the problems that dog the human community — wars and aggression. Conflicts come to the boil, the worl d is afflicted by acts of terrorism, and so on. This psycho-physical factor also leads to the natu ral factor acting on the human one which can lead to catastrophes, and explosions prompted by a person s psycho-physical state. There will be both natural and man-made disasters. Cataclysms of a natural kind will be associated with the Pacific basin — the Far East, Latin America and part of the American west coast. Cataclysms due to the human factor (wars, terrorism) will take place around the globe, These factors will operate for over a year, until the autumn of 1998 or even longer. A special role in all that takes place will be play ed by the Great Pyramid and energy installations of artificial origin. They will serve in part as resonators for these processes. Cancer sufferers or those with a predisposition to the disease should avoid visiting the Pyramid of Cheops during this period. Otherwise unpredictable processes may be started. We all have a predisposition to cancer, but if someone is balancing on the brink, it is better not to tempt fate"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"The Wands of Horus . 65 Third Edition - December 2001 Appendix 7 Parameters of an Individual Pyramid Calculations of the parameters of an individual py ramid are based on the length of a person’s spine. This is so that the three main concentration points of the energy flow within the pyramid precisely coincide with the first chakra (the energy projection of the prostate gland or uterus), the third chakra (projection of the pancreas) and the sixth and seventh chakras (hypothalamus and hypophysis). This arrangement of the pyramid's internal energy space is a good illustration of the idea that the pyramid is a model of the energy structure of the human being and the Universe that employs the letter's energy mechanism. Accordingly the pyramid's effect will be focussed on the organs of the endocrine system, stimulating its activity. A individual pyramid made of wood, or better still of glass, has a profound, but most importantly gentle effect on the whole of a person's organism. An individual pyramid makes it possible to stimulate the internal energy, biophysical and physiological proce sses that it turn make it possible to discover and activate the inner reserves of the human psyche, increasing psychic potential. Apart from that the pyramid has a positive stimulating influence on the immune and nervous systems, creating the preconditions for their improvement. From experiments that have been carried out make it possible to conclude that the pyramid’s structuring field has a positive effect on factors of natural resistance in the human organism (changes in cellular and humoral immunities). A rise in the orga nism’s antiviral activity has been reliably detected. Below there are a number of appendices (See (See “Appendix 9” on page 68 ), (See “Appendix 18” on page 82 ) and (See “Appendix 19” on page 83 )) containing the results of re search into the effect of the pyramid’s structuring field on living nature carried out by scientists of the Russian Academy of Sciences. If we bare in mind that the human organism is made up of almost 90% water, then it becomes clear that the pyramid’s structuring field will have a deep-reach ing corrective and stimulatory effect on the whole organism. The main thing is that this influence is natural (not medicinal) and that leads to a raising of the immune status of the organism.. Acting in essence as a resonator and generator of cosmic energies on various planes, the pyramid enables us to tap into natural flows of cosmic energy that gently stimulate evolutionary processes in human biological systems and consciousness, as the consciousness exists in a certain degree of dependency on the state of the energy and biological systems. Depending on the task being pursued the body of an individual pyramid may be truncated in such a way that its field is focus exclusively on the head. In such a pyramid only the upper third will be covered by the surfaces of the facets. The states experienced in the pyramids will not always be consistent. The appearance of an unusual state suggests that there are certain imbalances in the organism and is connect with the correction process. As soon as the disturbances have been harmonised, the unusual sensations will fade away. This is particularly true if you use the pyramid regularly. Therefore occasional unusual states should not worry you. A full-size individual pyramid has all the properties of a glass mini-pyramid, as described in (See “Appendix 11” on page 70 ).

A hieroglyph might contain several levels of information (meanings). Individual symbol s conveyed the meaning of a whole doctrine, while the expression of a single idea sometimes requires the writing of whole volumes of books. Moreover, writing things down in words opens the door to incorrect interpretation and manipulation. One of the reasons that humanity has still not reco gnised the depth of the knowledge of the Ancient Egyptian priests has lain in the in correct reading of the hieroglyphs. The ability to read the sacred texts was lost long before the sunset of the Egyptian civilisation. The priests of the last dynasties were no longer bear ers of knowledge who appreciated its true meaning. When they painted their hieroglyphs on the walls of temples, they had as much understanding of them as a Christian priest might have of a quantum physics textbook. It is for this very reason that the Ancient Egyptia n doctrine about, for exampl e, the \"water of life\" that Aristotle took from Thales of Miletus and has come down to the present was wrongly interpreted. What actually was the theory of the \"water of li fe\" that Thales brought from Egypt?. We shall examine two passages identical except for one change . Aristotle had Thales teaching that: Water is the chief principle of all things. Everything proceeds from it ... constantly arising, and to water everything returns. The changes in things are dictated by compression and hardening. The incorrect translation of the knowledge coming from the distant past was the consequence of a misunderstanding of the meaning of the relevant hierog lyphs; in particular the hieroglyph that bore the meaning of the concept of energy and resembled a \"wave\" is still today interpreted as \"water\". Take a look at this symbol . It greatly resembles a sine curve. In mathematics the sine curve is used to describe wave or vibration processes. Such an analogy is natural given the observation of the movement of waves on the surface of the water. Everything that comprises the nature of material is a consequence of various vibrations in the environment. Therefore the symbol that resembles a wa ve was used as naturally reflecting the essence of this process. If we replace the word water in the statement abov e with \"energy\", we get close to what lay at the very foundation of the doctrinal world view of the Ancient Egyptian priests. Energy is the chief principle of a ll things. Everything proceeds from it ... constantly arising, and to energy everything returns. The changes in things are dictated by compression and hardening [of energy]. The meaning of the symbol become s even more obvious when the eyes scanning across one of the walls in Toth-Ankh-Amon (Tutankhamen's) burial chamber light on the depiction of a priest. Above her hands is the familiar hieroglyph, indicating that the priest's hands are radiating energy that is not only ancient, but contemporary psychics and spiritual healers use to infl uence the energy structure of others."},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"The Wands of Horus . 67 Third Edition - December 2001 In the light of this, the \"Myth of the Creation of the World\" assumes its true meaning, revealing to us the secret of what the ancient priests knew about the beginnings of all that exists. \" In \"the beginning of beginnings\" there was nothing: no air, no light, no sound, no sky, no earth, no fire, no life, no death - only the endless, immobile Ocean of Primordial Energy immersed in gloom (Nun). God created himself out of the primordial energy. His name was Everything and Nothing (Atum)... \"67 Speaking of energy, the vitally active element of creation, from which all the great variety of life proceeds, at the beginning of the new millennium we can understand what lies behind these words. For centuries this ancient knowledge remained inacces sible for humanity immersed in the gloom of ignorance as it had been in Aristotle's time. More than 5000 years before Thales visited the country, the Ancient Egyptian priests had precise scientific knowledge. And only the vanity and blinkered attitudes of certain representatives of the world of science who still do not wish to acknowledge such \"predecessors\" prevent the study and appreciation of the stone testimony of the Ancient Egyptian cultu re as an embodiment of scientific learning and techniques, especially in the field of medicine and parapsychology, on a comparable level at least with contemporary attainments, and in a number of instances going far beyond our present mastery."},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"The Wands of Horus . 68 Third Edition - December 2001 Appendix 9 Exposure of Living Organisms in the Pyramid The Menchikov Vaccine Research Institute of the Russian Academy of Medical Sciences, laboratory head N.B.

The study was carried out on a model infec tion of mice caused by the bacterium called salmonella typhi murium , strain 415. White, non-pedigree mice weighting 12–14 grammes were exposed in the pyramid for various lengths of time and various numbers of times. After several days the mice were infected peritoneally using four doses of salmonella typhi murium , increasing by a factor of ten from 10 1 to 10 4 microbe cells. A control group of mice from the same batch were infected with the same doses of culture, but not exposed in the pyramid. It was reliably established that the survival rate for the mice exposed in the pyramid is considerably higher than for the control group. At the lower do ses 60% of the mice exposed in the pyramid survived, against 7% in the control group. At higher doses the corresponding figures were 30% and 3%. Conclusion: time spent by mice in the pyramid substantially promotes increased resistance to subsequent infection with salmonella typhi murium . In other words, it is possible to speak of a powerful immuno-modulating effect on the non-specific reactivity of the animals’ organism. A similar picture was observed when the mice were injected with various carcinogens. Mice in the experimental group drank water exposed in the pyramid; the control group drank ordinary water.

The research object was pyrolytic carbon obtained by precipitating the products of the pyrolysis of methane on a graphite liner at a temperature of ~2100C. Measurements were taken by the four-probe method on direct current under normal conditions. The size of the sheet was ~25x10x1mm; the distance between the potential contacts ~3mm.

After exposure in the pyramid for 24 hours resistance approximat ely doubled. Such changes are anomalous for pyrocarbon. Even neutron bombardment with at about 10 19 neutrons/cm 2 does not produce changes of more than 5%. Over time the changes taking place in electrical resistance varied from +100% to -100% following a sine curve. Besides, we discovered a reduction in the electrical resistance of silicon of semiconductor purity from 10 5 ohms/cm 2 to 10 4 ohms/cm 2 and a loss of high temprature superconductivity in samples after exposure in the pyramid."},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"The Wands of Horus . 70 Third Edition - December 2001 Appendix 11 Mini-pyramids Pyramids depicted as the “granaries of Joseph”. Thirteenth-century mosaic in St Mark’s Cathedral, Venice Scientific experiments studying the effect of pyramids have shown that using them may be of invaluable help to people and become an inseparable part of our lives. While the construction of large pyramids is an expensive business, the building of mini-pyramids is completely realistic. Of course mini-pyramids do no t have such a powerful structuring field as a large pyramid, nonetheless they do make it possible to tackle a fairly broad range of problems. A miniature energy structure of this kind can easily be set up in the home, as its dimensions are not large — only 70cm at the base. The configuration of such a pyramid will differ somewhat from that of the Great Pyramid of Cheops, due the facets sloping at a different angle, which makes it possible to increase the activeness of the mini-pyramid. Best of all are mini-pyramids made of glass as th at material best matches the resonant qualities required to obtain the appropriate result. With regard to energy, the pyramid divides up i nto three levels. The first, lowest level of the glass mini-pyramid has a strong stimulating field with a positive effect on living things. The focal point (lower platform) has a harsh structuring field capable of affecting inanimate object s. Water placed on this level will not become cloudy for a long time as the structuring field at this level suppresses bacterial activity. In other words, water that has been \"processed\" in this level is what is known as \"dead water\". Such water is very good, for example, for combatting inflammatory processes. \"Dead water\" has an astonishing capacity to redistribute energy. Afterwards \"living water\" (produced in the lower or middle level [upper platform] of the pyramid) should be used. Here too we should add that if you put your household first-aid kit (liquid and solid medicines) in the pyramid, then the effectiveness of antibiotics, for example, will increase by almost 5-10%. The results of experiments suggest that the mini-pyramid has a corrective effect on any medicinal preparation (the crystal lattice of dry items and the molecular structure of liquids), while the use of medicines that have been processed in the pyra mid encourages a rise in the immune status. Apart from medicines, you can place in the pyramid all kinds of creams, ointments, mineral waters, liquid extracts of medicinal herbs and much else. Creams and ointments processed in the lowest level will further the disappearance of skin irritations, suppressing the activity of harmful bacteria. At the Ivanovsky Virological Research Institute a study was made of the effect of the pyramid field on the anti-viral activeness of immunoglobulin. A preparation was produced in two different concentrations: 50 mg/ml and 0.5 mg/ml. Aliquot quantities of venoglobulin in both concentrations was exposed in the pyramid. The venoglobulin was introduced into cell cultures, 24 hours before they were infected with a virus. The study revealed that venoglobulin at a concentr ation of 0.5 mg/ml, that has protective effect on the cells, did acquire after exposure in the pyramid a virus-inhibiting effect th at was more pronounced than the preparation with 10 0 times greater concentration."},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"The Wands of Horus . 71 Third Edition - December 2001 Under further dilution, to concentrations of 0.005 mg/ml and 0.00005 mg/ml with subsequent exposure in the pyramid, the venoglobulin displa yed a pronounced anti-viral effect. The anti-viral activity of the venoglobulin practically ceas ed to depend on its concentration. (See “Appendix 18” on page 82 ). It should be stressed particularly that the key to the solution of a whole number of ecological problems lies in the structure of water. If, purely hypothetically, it was possible to suddenly change the structure of water in our environment (and we ours elves are made up of 90% water), the effect would exceed all expectations. Here are the results of just a few experiments on water (liquids) exposed in the pyramid. Again in the Virological Research Institute a study was made of the effect of the pyramid field on human lymphoblastic cells. The source of the pyramid field was water that had been exposed in the pyramid and then used to produce a nutrient solution. The study produced data on the stimulating effect of a nutrient solution produced from water exposed in the pyramid on the vitality and proliferation of human cells. It was discovered that cells could be kept alive longer. (See “Appendix 19” on page 83 ) Experiments showed that the use in the diet of or dinary or mineral water, as well as juices and decoctions, that had been processed in the pyra mid has a pronounced immuno-modulating effect. A striking effect was observed in mice injected with various carcinogens. One group drank water that had been exposed in the pyramid, the control grou p drank ordinary water. The result showed that the likelihood of developing tumours was several times higher in the control group. No less astonishing was the fact that after seve ral days spent in a pyramid mice began to swim, although it is common knowledge that mice cannot swim. The middle level of the pyramid (upper platform) is intended to influence living nature. Everything that you place on the middle level will further the processes that heal small wounds, activate the regeneration of skin tissue, have a positi ve effect on surface vessels and much else besides. Apart from the structuring processes taking place in side, a pyramid has a powerful effect on its immediate vicinity. Using radar installations working in the centimetre band located at distances of 60, 32 and 30 kilometres from the 22-metre pyramid situated at the village of Khitino near Ostashkov (between Moscow and Novgorod) a radar scan was made of the space around the vertical axis of the pyramid. The study revealed the presence of a column-like energy stru cture up to 2000 metres in height and 500 metres in width following the vertical axis of the pyramid. The height of the column was constantly varying between 800 and 2000 metres. At the All-Russian Lenin Electro-Technical Institute a study was carried out into the influence of the pyramid field on the electri cal field within a circular area delimited by 100-gramme pieces of granite that had been exposed in a pyramid. The pieces of granite were placed on a metal surface with a discharge electrode five metres above it. A metal surface enclosed by pieces of granite that had not been exposed in the pyramid was used as a control. The experiment recorded the trajectory of discha rges and the impact damage points within the granite circles. The experiment showed that the number of impact damage points inside the granite circle that had been exposed in the pyramid was five times less than in the control. Conclusion: the shape made up of pieces of stone exposed in the pyramid has powerful properties protecting the part of the surface inside it ag ainst damage from electrical discharges. (See “Appendix 20” on page 84 ) A whole book could be devoted to the useful proper ties of mini-pyramids. We should therefore like to finish this appendix by expressing our certainty that in time mini-pyramids will appear in every home. .

The reason for its appearance is metabolic disturbance in the organism, long-term incorrect di et, as well as, quite often, unfavourable ecological conditions. And while in days gone by osteochondrosis was the lot of the elderly, today it can be found in one form or another even in new-born infants. As far as conventional medicine is concerned the disease is practically irreversible and tends to progress with time. The conventional treatments offered have little effect. At best with a long course of injections and physiotherapy they can suppress an acute condition and put the process into a latent phase. The method of bio-energetic correction proposed by our specialists makes it possible not only to quickly remove the oedema of nerve endings caused by them being pinched by displaced vertebrae or salt deposits and restore normal blood circulation (roughly three sessions), but also by resonant vibration (5–7 sessions) to reduce or completely break up salt deposits and remove them into the blood where the dissolve in the most natural way. The method of working with patients proposed by our specialists consists of intensive non-contact influence on the bio-field (bio-energetic structure). Every living organism (indeed every organ) has its own particular biological rhythm. A shift away from that rhythm leads to the disruption of the functions of one or other organ (in the present case, in osteochondrosis, a focus of inflammation appears). Th e shift away from biorhythms can take different forms with internal (incorrect lifestyle, diet,...) or ex ternal (nervous stress, injury, ecological factors,...) causes. All those causes, however, are reflected in a person’s biorhythms, and that means in his or her health. It should be particularly stressed that immu no-competent cells are synthesised specifically in the spine (in the spinal cord) and then enter the thymus and the lymph. Therefore the depositing of salts in the spine (osteochondrosis) gradually inhibits this highly important function. Exploiting the existing close interaction and unity of the physical and bio-energetic shells forming the human organism, with long practice it is possible not only to arrest the process, but even to reverse it. When we speak of completely curing a person of osteochondrosis we must remember that it is necessary not only to eliminate the symptoms of the disease, but also to remove the causes behind its appearance. To achieve that, after a course of treatment a person must change many aspects of his or her behaviour (diet, avoiding a sedentary lifestyle, ...). Nonetheless, even without changes in lifestyle, a patient who has been through a full course of treatment is guaranteed between 6–8 months and several years of untroubled (symptom-free) existence. The method that has been developed also gives positive results in the treatment of such diseases as intercostal neuralgia, some forms of arthritis, lumbago and the like."},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"The Wands of Horus . 73 Third Edition - December 2001 Appendix 13 Maximum Permissible Levels for Permanent Magnetic Fields Confirmed by Deputy Chief State Sanitary Physician of the USSR V.Ye. Kovshilo 16 August 1977 No 1742–77 MAXIMUM PERMISSIBLE LEVELS (MPLs) FOR THE INFLUENCE OF PERMANENT MAGNETIC FIELDS WHEN WORKING WITH MAGNETIC DEVICES AND MAGNETIC MATERIALS (EXTRACT) 1.0 General Statements 1.1. The present MPLs apply to perm anent magnetic fields affecting the human body under various conditions (constantly, intermittently) 1.2. A magnetic field is generated by various magnetic devices: electromagnets, solenoids, impulse devices of a half-period or capacitor type, cast and metallo-ceramic magnets. The highest magnetic field intensity is found in the gap of electromagn ets and other devices generating a magnetic field, and also at the point of work of cast and metallo -ceramic magnets. The intensity of a magnetic field within the working area drops with distance from the centre of the magnetic device or the point of work of an artificial magnet. 1.3. Persons working with magnetic devices are subjected to the influence of the magnetic field. Vari- ous parts of the body are affected by the action of a magnetic field to differing degrees. 1.4. The degree of influence of a magnetic field on workers depends on the maximum intensity of the field in the working area of the device or the point of work of an artificial magnet, the location of the workplace and the working regime. 1.5. Constant work in conditions where they are su bjected to a magnetic field exceeding the MPLs may adversely affect workers’ health. Most commonly they develop disorders of the nervous and car- dio-vascular systems, the upper respiratory orga ns, the digestive apparatus, certain biochemical indicators of the blood and urine, as well as of the morphological composition of peripheral blood and ESR [erythrocyte sedimentation rate]. In the initial stages of the development of the pathologi- cal process the changes are of a co mpensatory nature. At this stage under the influence of treatment as an out-patient or at a polyclinic a positive dynamic is observed; after the transition to a sub-com- pensatory state it may become necessary to provid e in-patient treatment and a certain degree of incapacity may arise. 1.6. To prevent harmful effects of magnetic fields on workers it is necessary to implement protective and prophylactic measures and to avoid exceeding the present MPLs. 1.7. The present MPLs apply to the design, installation and use of magnetic installations and magnetic materials with a large induction level at all enterpri ses, irrespective of the branch of state power to which they belong. 1.8.

The construction itself and the materials used by those who planned it indicate that behind the idea lay the “Principle of Correspondence” which is at the basis of all energy- and information-exchange processes in nature. The application of this principle is eloquent testimony to the Ancients’ profound knowledge in the field of natural science. In order to illustrate the sense of this principle and how it is connected with the pyramid and its effect, we should remind the reader that life arose on our blue planet thanks to the presence there of a liquid hydrosphere. It is also a well known fact that water, while the simplest chemical compound on our planet, is also the most mysterious of substanc es — all its properties are anomalous due to the peculiarities of its structure. Science has long since noted the anomalously high sp eed of sound in water — four times that in air. The Ancients, however, were also aware that besides that water has the capacity to convey electrical and energy signals over tremendous distances. Evidently this circumst ance was taken into account by the Ancients as they constructed the pyramids and othe r religious edifices close to water. If water was further away then channels were cut to the pyramid s or artificial reservoirs created that were called sacred lakes. That was done to link the pyram ids with the general pl anetary energy system (57 ). In 1933 researchers managed to establish that the anomalous properties of water are mainly due to the hydrogen bonds that also play an important role in organic chemistry. The hydrogen bonds form an endless “multi-strand cable” along which information is conveyed instantaneously. It was evidently out of appreciation for the unusual properties of water that the Ancient Mayas worshipped the gods by gigantic wells called cenotes . Because the Mayas’ knowledge, like that of the Egyptians, was founded on what they received from Atlantean colonists who came to the Yucatan peninsula immediately after th e inundation of their homeland, in worshipping the gods by cenotes the Mayan priests established contact through the water with the Atlantean energy sources that were still active at that time as well as natural sources of energy. Thousands of these wells are scattered across the peninsula, many in remote places. These water arteries form a complex hydrogeological network that discharges directly into the sea. Studies of the properties of water have shown th at it reaches maximum density at +4°C. Therefore the world’s oceans with an average temperature of +3.7 °_ represents, excluding ne gligible distortions on the surface, a single huge liquid crys tal or something like a quantum liqu id in which all the particles are connected together by collective interaction. [10 ] In other words the waters of the oceans together with the adjoining seas and lakes and the rivers and streams that flow in to all of them form a single energy- conducting medium linking the most remote areas of the planet. Thus, in order that a pyramid as a resonator amp lifying the effect of the “Energy Source” inside it might be in energo-informational interaction with objects located far away, the Ancients built near water or on sites of geological fractures and used in their co nstruction work materials that are akin to water in their structure and resonant with the “Energy Source” inside the pyramid. We have already mentioned that the basis of th e “Energy Source” in the pyramid of Cheops was a crystal whose lattice structure was closest to that of quartz which many ancient civilisations regarded as a sacred mineral. “With the discovery of X-rays and the development of X-ray structural analysis, the very first works showed that liquid water is closer in structure to solids than to gases. “On this basis Bernal and Fowler constructed a fu ndamentally new model of the structure of liquid water and the transformations that take place within it with changing temperature. It emerged that water has a tetrahedral structure like quartz of various mo difications, which can be rephrased in roughly this way: ‘Quartz has a structure like water.’” [10 ] The similarity in structure between these two at firs t sight different substances or, to use the concepts of the Ancients, their “correspondence”, determines th eir resonant interaction. Therefore quartz is a highly important material used not only in the co nstruction of the pyramids and energy sources of various kinds, but also as a filling for the Wands of Horus . The reports of archaeological expeditions that worked in the Giza plateau area do indeed record that a large quantity of large-grain quartzites was used in the construction of the Pyramid of Cheops."},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"The Wands of Horus . 75 Third Edition - December 2001 Archaeologists immediately noted a strange, hitherto unknown peculiarity — a distinctive alternation of layers of petrified mortar and sand containing quartz that does not occur in th e vicinity of the pyramid. An examination of a geometric model of the pyramid prompted the conclusion that the pyramid is in essence a powerful resonator, vibrating at a frequency set by the “Energy Source”. We have already stated that according to some Ancient Egyptian te xts the pyramid resonates at the frequency of our planet, that is, works in its frequency range. Bu t the “Energy Source” itself, being a highly complex device with an autonomous internal source of energy intended to last several thousand years also works in a low frequency band connected with the core of our planet. It is worth stating briefly that through the core of the planets using gravitational, electromagnetic and other means of interaction (including resonan ce) communication is achieved between planetary and galactic systems, joining the whole Univer se into a single energo-informational space. This mechanism is the basic one in the system of energo-informational interaction that operates through the pyramids. Apart from the basic m echanism, there are secondary ones, however. Under the pressure of the great architectural mass the quartz used in the construction of the pyramid generates what we can define as piezo-electricity. Besi des, the heating of the body of the pyramid in the mornings and afternoons leads to a deformation of the surfaces of the quartz crystals that also produces a piezo-electric effect that again is involved in the cr eation of a sort of electromagnetic shell around the pyramid. The “Energy Source” inside the pyramid, like the hypothalamus and hypophysis in the human organism, sets the frequency at which the electromagne tic shell created around th e pyramid by the quartz crystals begins to vibrate. This impulse in turn is instantaneously conveyed via atmospheric electricity, water vapour and the waterways surrounding the pyramid over tremendous distances, having an effect on people far away from the pyramid (58 )."},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"The Wands of Horus . 76 Third Edition - December 2001 Appendix 15 Ancient Way of Looking at the World An analysis of the Ancients’ level of knowledge an d of the religious teachin gs that formed in the process of historical development leads to the un equivocal conclusion that at the foundation of the ancient way of looking at the world there was one substa ntial defect that determined the fate of not only Atlantis and Hyperborea, but also the Egyptian, Mayan, Toltec, Aztec and many other past civilisations. The evolutionary significance of the consequences of that “defect” has proved so powerful that almost fifteen millennia were needed to produce the conditions needed to correct the deformations of moral and ethical standards that arose in the consciousness of the earthly human race. The chief cause of the general decline in morality and, as a consequence, of the long period of degradation full of tragic events intended to cause mankind to recognise the need to think again is the prevailing attitude towards God. Practically not a single one of the religious teachings and philosophical doctrines existing today provides mankind with the n ecessary conception of the Creator. More than that — the subject is not even broached, and all attempts to discuss Him come down in effect to questions of the relationship between man and God. With all the ramifications of the question posed in that way, the attention of many generations ended up being distracted from the key issue that in fact, by forming the basis of the world view, determines the fundamental meaning of existence and the principles for interaction with the World. Many millennia have gone by in the history of our civilisation, but mankind still remains totally ignorant about God. We believe, discuss, debate, draw dividing lines and fall out on the grounds of religious differences. We even kill each other in the name of faith. We have gone so far that we no longer remember our origins — the great revelation with which EVERYTHING began... The human race has gone down a blind alley, the way out of which may be provided by remembering the origins and the tie between a person and the world around. The knowledge acquired in ancient times, but cosmic in origin (59 ), including information about the structure of the solar system and the fundamentals of calculating cyclical processe s, also included information about the structure of the human organism and of everything that exists — the BA–KA principle. If we bear in mind that everything in our universe is constructed in accordan ce with that principle, th en it becomes evident that the quintessence of the knowledge passed on in ancient times was the pointing out of the unity of structure between Man and the Universe. (60 ). There is hope that at the current historical stag e that mankind’s intelligence will prove sufficiently developed to grasp the meaning of the knowledge about God given to humans in earlier times. And while in the remote past that knowledge belonged to a narrow circle of people, the time has now come to correct that shortcoming and to make it the property of all mankind. Knowledge of God For all who inhabit our universe, God remains invisible because no-one knows exactly what God is. In finding out about itself and the world around it, mankind inhabiting our universe will gradually come closer to solving the mystery. But everything is co nstructed in such a way that, as we approach the horizon, we will constantly see it moving further on. Therefore the meaning of life will always be to seek knowledge of the Unknowable. There are several points of view about the nature of God, the most predominant of which amounts to the following: “Something possessing both male and female aspects. Something that managed to embody within itself all the laws of Time and Space and created myriads of its own ‘projections’ (61 ) following a single genetic code (62 ). “All the ‘projections’ created (by God) do not embo dy within themselves th e laws of time and space. In the process of the evolution of forms that unfolds in accordance with the Creator’s genetic programme, ‘projections’ live in a particular time and place for a given length of time. “Each ‘projection’ (human being) carries within it several levels (energy bodies) and all those levels are directly connected to the creator. We are HIS eyes, HIS cells (63 ). Through us the Creator observes the world, learning about HIM who is outside of time and space, without beginning or end...” Having created our universe, the Creator thus entered the next stage of His evolutionary development. He will remain in this phase as long as is required to reach a higher stage of evolutionary"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"The Wands of Horus . 77 Third Edition - December 2001 development through self-knowledge and self-improvement. To make that transition the Creator will have to grasp, master and Himself embody laws of an even higher order. The mechanism of learning through self-knowledge and self-improvement operates according to the following pattern: The Creator produces within Himself (“in his bosom”) x number of His own “projections” that then begin to develop according to the programme envisaged by the Creator (64 ). Passing through various evolutionary stages in the course of numerous incarnations, each “projectio n” accumulates knowledge and experiences, while its energy potential grows. Th e Creator Himself, transferring His “projections” from one time to another (different historical ages) and from one space to another, observes the world through them, thus learning about the being in whose bosom He Himself is creating and developing (65 ) When, following the long and thorny paths of evolut ion, the “projections” created by God reach the zenith of their development, the Creator’s pote ntial is accordingly increased by a factor of x (66 ), and He enters into a state anticipating the transition to the following level of His existence. Forming the basic position of the world view, this knowledge given to humanity long ago was intended to make people understand that life given to a person by God is a priceless gift and the highest responsibility. A person’s consciousness becomes cosmic from the moment he or she realises that the Creator is perfecting Himself through his own creation. Accordingl y a person creates not only his or her own life, but also, to some degree, the future of the universe. Cosmic ethics begin with an awareness that God is watching us through the people around us, irrespective of the colour of their skin or their religio n. Therefore, before making any move or taking any decision that might affect someone’s life, you should remember that through people God is watching you (67 ). In doing something for another person, you indirectly do it for the Creator. When speaking of the meaning of life, bear in mind that through the works of human beings, through the development of the individual and co llective consciousness the Creator is perfecting Himself. Therefore the meaning of life lies in acq uiring knowledge, acquiring self-knowledge and improving oneself to the benefit of humanity, which means to the benefit of the Creator (68 ). In addressing God, a person addresses that wh ich created the person and the universe with everything that inhabits it. God created all human beings “in his image and likeness” (69 ). Therefore all the humanoids inhabiting out universe resemble each other apart from insignificant differences due to the conditions of life and the composition of the atmosphere on the various planets. Anthropologically we are all identical. The inhabitants of other univer ses are not like us, because they have a different genetic code. The programme laid down in the human being’s genetic code is a road that has at some time been travelled or, to some degree, one that is mapped out by the Creator of our universe. Therefore everything should develop in a natural way and without detriment to the evolution of the mind of the individual. The representatives of advanced extraterrestrial civilisations that visit the Earth do not interfere with the life of us earthlings, understanding that to interfere in the life and works of a person or of humanity as a whole is to interfere in the works of the Creator. The extraterrestrials understand deeply that in our universe there are no two identical people. Every person is one of the facets (projections) of the Cr eator. Following his or her own totally unique path through a host of reincarnations, a person, reaching the peak of his or her development, may possibly create a new totally unique universe; while any unwi se interference in a person’s works may have a detrimental effect on his or her evolutionary path. The ancients did not understand the profound mean ing of the knowledge that was passed to them and blood was spilt. An irresponsible attitude to human life deformed the very foundation of moral and ethical principles. The situation that arose led to the gradually degradation of our civilisation — and all humanity’s problems today have their origins in those times. In looking at itself and the world through the prism of that ancient knowledge, human beings gain the opportunity, by re-examining their relations with one another (and that means with God) to stop the process of degradation and establish the preconditions for a future ascent. Any kind of knowledge is not merely a blessing, but also a responsibility. What the world will be like, who and what will be served by the knowledge of God, will depend on human beings. This ancient knowledge gives the key to understanding that we are linked by an invisible thread to all the world around us as well as to each other."},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"The Wands of Horus . 78 Third Edition - December 2001 Modern humanity erroneously believes that the level of a civilisation’s development is determined by achievements in science or technology. A time wi ll come when people will realise that the true measure of development is the level of knowledge of the Creator. This is an extremely important aspect of which the modern school gives us no inkling. It follows that the human being deprived of this, not recognising his close ties with the world around, is pr imitive. He does not in any way grasp, nor can he grasp, the meaning of this ethical principle, th is fundamental natural phenomenon, without which normal, correct development is impossible. The true achievement of a civilisation does not lie in the knowledge of how to create a laser device or a flying machine. The main thing is the factor of human relations,forming on the basis of knowledge about the Creator. Sometime, having completed a long road, we shall b ecome capable of creating universes, but for the moment we should recognise that before becoming a god, a person needs to become a Human Being."},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"The Wands of Horus . 79 Third Edition - December 2001 Appendix 16 Experience of Paul Branton in the Great Pyramid The incident that happened to Patrick Flannagan and Eve Bruce was not the only one of its kind. The things that take place in the pyramid do not follow a set plot and are in some astonishing manner connected with the individual nature of each person and what prompts them to spend the night in the Great Pyramid. Everything that has taken place in the pyramid over its thousands of years of existence has left its informational mark in the pyramid’s structure. Theref ore a person who happens to be in the pyramid at the right time (determined by the act ivation of the “Source”) can become a witness to astonishing events as he or she taps into the “information hologram” — the database outside of time that is a part of the Noosphere. Here is the account of the experience of Paul Branton, a British journalist popular in the 1930s, who decided to spend a night in the Great Pyramid. “I do not know exactly how much time passed since then, but suddenly I sensed the presence in the room of a new being that radiated a barely noticeable glittering light that in some incomprehensible manner lit up the space around them... “It approached me, coming between me and the marble sarcophagus. I looked into its face and saw before me a very, very old man. “‘Today you are to enter the Chamber of Knowledge, ’ he stated dispassionately. ‘You should lie on this stone! In former times it would have taken place there, on a bed of papyrus.’ And he pointed to the stone sarcophagus. “Without even bothering to think over what I had h eard, I immediately obeyed the mysterious visitor and stretched out, face upwards, on the surface of the stone. “What happened right after that, I still do not understand. All my muscles tensed, after which my body began to be gripped by a strange paralysing lethargy. My limbs began to grow heavy and stiff. At first cold gripped my feet. It was as if someone ha d frozen them. Gradually th e weird numbness reached my knees, but it did not stop there, going on to em brace my entire body. It was as if I had fallen waist- deep into a snowdrift while ascending some mountain peak. I lost all sensation in my legs. “I began to drift into oblivion and a vague pres entiment of approaching d eath crept into my mind. But I was not afraid as I had long since managed to free myself from the primiti ve fear of death and now regarded its inevitability with philosophical calm. “By now the weird cold had already gripped my spine. My breathing became ever weaker and I myself seemed to begin dropping down somewhere into the depths of consciousness, into some central point of my own brain. “When, however, the cold reached my chest, ha ving practically paralysed my whole body, I felt something similar to a heart-attack. And although it soon passed, I guessed that the worst moment still lay ahead. “An astonishingly absurd thought came into my head and if my petrified jaw had been able to move, it might even have made me laugh out loud. This is what I thought: “In the morning my corpse will be found in the pyramid and that will be the end of all my occult searchings.\" “I have no doubt that all my sensations were evoked by the transition of my own soul from physical life to a posthumous state. “But although I knew that I was feeling the appro ach of death, I did not even think of resisting. “Finally, the moment came when all my concentrated awareness was fo cussed solely in my head and its last desperate flares gradually extinguished in the depths of the brain. It seemed to me as if I was picked up by a powerful tropical hurricane and dr agged somewhere upwards along a narrow corridor. Then came a frighteningly unexpected emergen ce into endless space and — I had attained Freedom ! “There are no words to describe that serene state of lightness in which I found myself. I had turned into a mental being consisting solely of thoughts and sensations and entirely free of the burdensome weight of physical flesh that had hitherto encumber ed me. I cast off my earthly body like a ghost, like a dead man rising from the grave, but my consciousness did not suffer one iota on that account. On the contrary, I began to sense the reality of my existen ce more clearly than before. Most importantly, though,"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"The Wands of Horus . 80 Third Edition - December 2001 after my exodus from the physical world, in that unknown dimension in which I now found myself I acquired a sense of boundless and most serene freedom . “At first I felt that I continued lying horizontally on my back like the body I had just left, only raised a little above my stone couch. Then it seemed to me that someone’s invisible hand, slightly pushing me forward returned me to a vertical position, and I was able to stand on my feet again. Finally I was left with the strange mixed sensation that I was standing and lying at the same time. “I looked down and saw my abandoned body, still stretched out motionless on the surface of the block of stone. I saw the upturned impassive face: the eyes were half-closed, but the pupils shining beneath the lids indicated that perhaps I continued to gaze attentively into the darkness. The arms were crossed over the chest, although I remembered with certainty that I had left them stretched out alongside my body. The legs remained stretched out and pressed tightly together. I reminded myself of a corpse, a dead form that the soul had already left. “I noticed that now I a barely visible silvery glow was coming off me — off the new me, shining directly onto the lifeless being that rested on the stone couch below. That was amazing, but even more amazing was the fact that the glow of this mysterious psychic umbilical cord I had noticed lit up the part of the King’s Chamber above which I was now floating. I could even make out separate stones in the wall, as if by moonlight. “I had turned into a ghost, a disembodied being suspended in space and I understood at last why in their hieroglyphic inscriptions th ose wise Ancient Egyptians depicted the liberated human soul in the form of a bird. I felt that now I could embrace a far greater volume of space and move within it far more freely as if wings had sprouted from my back. I rose into the air and hung above my abandoned body just like a bird rises into the sky and then circles abov e its nest. What of the sense of a great emptiness surrounding me? It would undoubtedly be hard to find a more fitting image for this state than a bird. “Yes, I soared upwards, having freed the soul fro m mortal bonds. Dividing into two visually identical parts, I left the world to which I was accu stomed. In my new tele-double I felt an exceptional lightness, the ethereality of my new nature. Looking down at the cold stone on which my body was stretched out, I suddenly grasped one important thing that long possessed me and I silently said to myself: “This is the state of death. And now I know that I am a spirit and that I can exist separately from the body. I will always remember that, because I saw it all with my own (albeit non-physical) eyes.’ “That revelation stuck in my mind all the time that i spent in a state of weightlessness above my own emptied material shell. I proved to myself the reality of immortality by what I consider the most reliable method — I simply died and then rose again! I continued to look at th e horizontal remains I had left and did not cease to be amazed: is that em pty shell really what for many years I believed to be me? In actual fact my body was only a prison in which the real me was incarcerated, but now I had broken free. From time to time I was born on this plan et thanks to the latest in a succession of physical organisms that I mistakenly long perceived as my true, chief self. “Unexpectedly the same old priest appeared alongsi de me, serious and sober as before. Raising his eyes he declaimed: “O Amon, o Amon who art in Heaven, turn your coun tenance on the dead body of your son and take him to you into the world of the spirit. Let it be so.’ And then he addressed me: “Now you have learned this great lesson. A person cannot die, because his soul is born of Immortality. “The secret of the Great Pyramid is the secret of your own essence. Therein lies the lesson of the Great Pyramid, that each person should try to penetrat e inside himself, to reach the unknown focus of his own being and find in it his soul, attain the invisible depths of his own temple and discover for himself its innermost secrets. Farewell!’ “At that point my thoughts were swept up in some unknown maelstrom that seized me. It seemed to be sucking me down, forcing me to descend lower an d lower. I was gripped by a strange numbness and I felt myself sinking back into my physical body. I exerted all my will, trying to budge the frozen muscles, but to no avail and finally — I lost consciousness.”"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"The Wands of Horus . 81 Third Edition - December 2001 Appendix 17 \"Atlantean Diadem\" Like the Wands of Horus , the device that we call the \"Atlantean Diadem\" was also inherited by the Ancient Egyptians from the Atlanteans who came to northern Africa long before Egyptian civilisation reached its peak. The very idea on which the construction of the Atla ntean Diadem is founded draws on the Ancients' extremely profound conception of the structural un ity that exists between the human being and the Universe, of the human energy system and its projections on the surface of the body. With its harmonising effect on the hemispheres of the brain, the Atlantean Diadem is a sort of transformer of the energy flow that passes throug h the energy projections of the hypothalamus and hypophysis which in its turn has a stimulating effect on the person's entire energy structure, activating it. (See “Appendix 3” on page 50 ). Alongside the Wands of Horus and copper skin-pat ches, the Atlantean Diadem is the third element that the Ancients used to pr epare a priest or pharaoh for \"Intercourse with the gods\". The mechanism by which the Atlantean Diadem functions, the principles behind its construction and also the unique possibilities that the diadem opens up will not be described in the present publication out of ethical considerations. This is because among th e readers there may well be obsessional \"enthusiasts\" who in the effort to unlock their own higher potential will try to produce a diadem and test it on themselves without possessing the necessary knowledge. As the properties of the diadem are tightly bound up with the activities of the brain that is in constant interaction with the energy processes taking place in the environm ent, when using the diadem one should pay very careful attention to solar activity. During periods of high solar activity, the Atlantean Diadem is capable of affecting the brain very strongly indeed. Besides, it should be emphasised that for about 5% of people the use of the Atlantean Diadem is cont ra-indicated altogether. This is connected with individual genetic make-up. Therefore, we issue a warning that the use of the Atlantean Diadem without consulting a specialist from the IUFORIC can lead to serious adverse consequences."},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"The Wands of Horus . 82 Third Edition - December 2001 Appendix 18 Influence of Pyramid Exposed Water on the Coagulatory System Professor V.A. Makarov, Haematological Resear ch Centre of the Russian Academy of Medical Sciences In order to study the influence of water exposed in a pyramid on the coagulatory system of the blood we carried out a study of the influence of this substance on certain coagulatory parameters in vitro using donor blood as well as standard normal and pathol ogical (reduced level of coagulatory factors) lyophilised human plasma and lyophilised pathological human plasma deficient in factor VIII. Besides this we made a study of pyramid water in vivo , in an experiment with rabbits. The donor blood was obtained by puncturing the cubital vein and stabilised with a 3.8% solution of sodium citrate ( Merck , Germany) in a ratio of 9:1. Blood samples for the evaluation of coagulatory parameters were taken from the marginal vein of the rabbits’ ears using the free-falling drops method. In order to obtain plasma rich in thrombocytes the blood was centrifuged for 10 minutes at 1000 revolutions per minute, after which the upper layer of plasma was transferred to another test-tube and the remainder was centrifuged again for 20 minutes at 3000 revs/min. to obtain thrombocyte-free plasma. At one of the stages a study was made of possibl e changes in the coagulatory system of rabbits in vivo if their ordinary drinking wa ter was replaced by water exposed in the pyramid. The experiments were conducted over 14 days. Blood was taken from the rabbits before they began drinking pyramid water, and also 7 and 14 days into the experiment. The number of thrombocytes was determined by the optical method proposed by B. Walkowiak et al. A sample of rich plasma was dissolved in ten times the amount of a 0.01-molar phosphate buffer, containing 0.14 moles NaCl (pH 7.3) and the density was measured in plastic dishes at A 800 against a weak plasma diluted in the same way. The quantity of thrombocytes before the introduction of the pyramid water was taken as 100%. On the 7th day of the experiment the quantity had risen to 129±10% and on the 14th day to 167±18%. A reduction in the prothrombin time and a rise in the number of thrombocytes was reliably established. ✦ ✦ ✦ Professor A.G.

The patients were new-born babies with serious pathologies.

Klimenko of the Russian Academy of Medical Sciences, N.N. Nosik Ph.D. (Medical Science), D.N. Nosik Ph.D. (Medical Science) Human Lymphoblastic Cells We conducted a study of the effect of the pyramid field on human lymphoblastic cells. The source of the pyramid field was water that had been exposed in the pyramid and then used to produce a nutrient solution. The viability of the cells was determined by staining with 0.4% tripan blue (Serva, Germany) and MTT (Sigma, USA) with spectrophotometry of the ab sorption of the vital dye. As early as the 10th day of the experiment there began a noticeable (sev eralfold) growth in the number of cells and the percentage of viable cells in the tr eated sample compared to the control. Data was obtained on the stimulating effect of a nutrient medium prepared with water exposed in a pyramid on the viability and proliferation of human cells. An increase in the duration of viability over the control was found. For example, on day 11 these figures were 1.2 million/ml and 52% respectively for the control and 1.4 million/ml and 88% for the experiment; on day 21 0.05 million/ml and 2% for the control, and 0.3 million/ml and 49% for the experiment. Antiviral Activity of Immunoglobulin In the same place we conducted a study of the effect of the pyramid field on the antiviral activity of immunoglobulin. The subject of the study was venoglobulin — human polyvalent immunoglobulin for intravenous injection. The study was carried out on a culture of human diploid fibroblast cells. To determine the antiviral activity of the immunoglobulin the virus causing encephalomyocarditis (EMC) in mice was used. The antiviral activity of the preparat ion was determined by its capacity to protect the human cells from the cytopathic action of the virus. The venoglobulin was dissolved in distilled wa ter in accordance with th e instructions to a concentration of 50 mg/ml. In the study the preparation was tested at two concentrations: 50 mg/ml and 0.5 mg/ml. Aliquot quantities of venoglobulin in both concentrations was exposed in the pyramid. The venoglobulin was introduced into cell cultures, 24 hours before they were infected with a virus. The EMC virus reproduces well in diploid cultures of human fibroblasts, producing a pronounced cytopathic effect. The infectious titre of the virus reached 5.0 lg CPD 50 . Venoglobulin at a concentration of 50 mg/ ml significantly inhibited the reproduction of th e virus and its titre reached only 2.0 lg TCPD 50 (a inhibition factor of 3.0 lg). With the concentra tion of the preparation reduced 100-fold, a protective effect could no longer be detected. When venoglobulin preparations of the same concen trations that had, however, been exposed in the pyramid were used a different picture was observed. In this case the preparation at a concentration of 50 mg/ml inhibited the reproduction of the EMC virus by 4.0 lg. Most significant, however, was that the preparation at a concentration of 0.5 mg/ml had the same inhibiting effect. Thus, venoglobulin at a concentration of 0.5 mg/ml that had had no protectiv e effect on the cells, after spending time in the pyramid possessed a more pronounced virus-inhibi ting effect than a preparation 100 times more concentrated. Under further dilution, to concentrations of 0.005 mg/ml and 0.00005 mg/ml with subsequent exposure in the pyramid, the venoglobulin displayed a pronounced anti-viral effect — the titre of the EMC virus reached only 1.0 lg TCPD 50 .

The basic set-up used had a rod-surface air-gap between the electrodes of 5.0 metres. The experimental set-up was the same, except that placed on the surface were 7 pieces of granite, each weighing 100 grammes that had been exposed in the pyramid and were placed on the surface around the perimeter of a 1-metre-diameter circle with its centre 0.5 metres from the centre of the surface. 100 voltage impulses were applied to each of the se t-ups. The trajectories of the discharges and the impact damage points were recorded. On the basis of the results a plot of the impact points was produced. The discharge voltage throughout the experiments was approximately 1400 kV. As a result of the study it was reliably established that the number of impact points inside the circle in the basic set-up was 5 times higher than in the experimental set-up.

It is made in such a way that it can produce all the substances and hormones necessary for the vital pro cesses. By introducing various medicines into the organism, even when there is an urgent need, we are nonetheless interfering with the natural mechanisms, something which has an adverse effect on the immune system. Let us examine one indicative example: when insulin is injected into the body, the pancreas i mmediately stops producing that hormone — why produce it when it is already pr esent? There is a wide spectrum of all manner of medical preparations and vitamins that, when introduced into the organism, suppress their production by the body itself. The organism begins to “get lazy” and that leads to a worsening of its overall immune status. The Wands of Horus possess a unique quality: they stimulate and activate natural functions of the organism that have been suppressed by the use of medicines. Thus regular use of the Wands of Horus creates the necessary preconditions for the revival of suppressed functions, the normalisation and improvement of the immune system. To intensify the stimulating effect of the Wand s of Horus on the immune system and increase their corrective effect on the secondary consequences of diseases, and also on diseases currently in a latent phase, the Wands of Horus need to be used in conjunction with special copper patches. These copper patches are attached to the appropriate acupu ncture points on the body, making it possible to direct the effect to a particular orga n or to the immune system as a whole. 2 Unfortunately, it has to be noted that in referri ng to “esoteric” knowledge, many authors lead their readers astray. The very word “esoteric” means secret , that is to say concealed from the majority of people. But if authors shout about this esoteric knowledge from the rooftops and regularly mention it in their books, then the knowledge in question is no longer “esoteric”, but rather “exoteric” — and the two concepts should not be confused. 3 Fifteen years of study in the temple at Luxor conv inced the Alsatian philosopher Schwaller de Lubicz that the orthodox view is either erroneous or hopelessly outdated. The data that he assembled contra- dict practically all the generally accepted conceptions abou t the history of mankind and the evolution of “civilization”. Like the classical authors of th e Ancient World, Schwaller de Lubicz believes that Egyptian science — specifically medicine, mathematic s and astronomy — was at a far higher level of development than many modern scholars are prepared to accept. He also notes that every aspect of Egyptian culture was already perfectly formed at the moment it appeared! As John Anthony West asserts: “Egyptian civilization did not appear as the result of ‘develop- ment’ — it was a legacy (or rather a gift received from others).” 4 An ordinary non-specialist might ask why we divide specifically by four. It is bo und up with a fundamental natural phenomenon that is known as the prin- ciple of dichotomy. It was observed that when a string begins to vibrate it moves as shown in diagram A. Immediately, howeve r, it starts to produce overtones, that is to say its two halves begin to vibrate as if some invisible finger had pressed down on its precise center. Each half in turn begins to produce overtones (to divide into two) and so it goes on. It is as if the string instantly “stops” itself in the middle, instantaneously, and the result is to produce a note that is the same, but an octave higher. Incidentally, if we take any segment and divide it precisely in half, that will always produce two segments divided in the ratio of the Golden Section. Thus in the present case it would perhaps be more correct to write 78:4 as (78:2):2, i.e. 78 cm divided in half, then divided in half again."},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"The Wands of Horus Notes & References . 86 Third Edition - December 2001 5 Everything that makes up the nature of material is the consequence of the interaction of various vibra- tions in the environment, in other words, of freque ncies, since a frequency is the rate of vibration. When we want to find out the rate of a process that we are studying, we draw a graph. In this example we have plotted changing pressure (D) against time (T). In order to find out what the rate of the process was at a given moment in time (point C), we need to draw the tangent (AE) to the curve at C. The slope of this tangent (angle _) is an expression of the rate of the process. In order to determine that angle we take the ratio of one side of the right-angled triangle (BC) to the other (AB). It follows that the hypotenuse (here AC) of a right-angled triangle is the formal expression of the rate of any process. 6 This experiment, carried out in 1978, is quite intere sting. The researchers planned to create this small version of the Pyramid of Cheops with a base roughly 17 metres square using “the Ancient Egyptians’ method” — employing an inclined plane to raise the bl ocks to the required height. Despite the fact that the volume of the Japanese miniature was 2367 times less than that of the Great Pyramid itself, its builders were unable to drag the blocks of stone to the upper levels and so were obliged to complete their pyramid using cranes, bulldozers and winches. This edifice still stands in Japan, the first pyramid in the Far East, but it was generally acknowledged that the experiment fell short of success. This is borne out by the book that the researchers published — with the candid title “How the Pyramids Were Not Built”. 7 Only five of the eleven have survived, the remaining six were destroyed by the action of water and time. 8 The sequence 2,1,3,4. That is to say two panels with “tops”, followed by one without, then three with tops, and four without. In geometry this sequen ce of numbers defines the concept of Pythagoras’ Tetraxi s. 9 For the Ancient Egyptian priests, BA denoted the focal point (of refraction) of an energy or light flow, that spread out evenly from it in all directions (globally and at once, without and within) — like the focal point of an optical system, refracting the flow of light entering an optical device from the envi- ronment outside. Both the photographic camera and the human eye function on this same principle. In other words, the human being is a manifest focal point transforming (refracting) energy flows. 10 Folklore and oral tradition in Arab countries asserts that music and sounds were used in the construc- tion of most ancient unique edifices. After the completion of some room an instrument (tuning device) capable of producing particular notes was brought in. From the quality of the sound (the acoustics, the depth and duration of the sound) it was possible to draw conclusions about the resonance properties of the room, in other words about the product of the construction work. If the result was unsatisfactory further work would be car- ried out until the room began to “ring”. In this context it is worth mentioning Doctor Joseph Martin Shore’s expedition to the Giza pla- teau and the Valley of the Kings. Shore’s experiments in the large “burial chambe r” of the Pyramid of Cheops produced sensa- tional results. They showed that the pyramid was perhaps constructed as a generator or amplifier of certain sonic frequencies. Shore’s group managed to identify four main frequ encies (notes) amplified by the edifice and used for its material construction. The notes form the chord of F sharp major, which, according to some Ancient Egyptian texts, harmon ises with our planet’s own vibratory frequency. ENTERPRISE MISSION (material published in NLO , Issue 1, 1998, p. 11) 11 The rock beneath the pyramid is approximately one-fift hs of the height of the edifice. That means that less material was required for the construction from the nearby quarries than was previously believed. This is borne out by calculations of the volume of material extracted from the quarries and that of the pyramid."},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"The Wands of Horus Notes & References . 87 Third Edition - December 2001 12 The history of quartz goes back far further than th at of diamonds and other precious stones. The legen- dary civilisation of Atlantis was already aware of the hidden power and colossal energy of quartz crys- tals. Legends and popular beliefs about quartz that survive in Tibet inform us of the extensive use in Atlantis of rock crystal (transparent quartz) ranging from healing to telepathic communication and tap- ping the energy of the Cosmos. Those legends speak of the Atlanteans having gigantic pyramids, colossal energy-stores. The summits of many pyram ids were crowned with large crystals of quartz. Much of the Atlanteans’ knowledge disappeared, but some survived to put out shoots in other cultures — in Egypt, Tibet and India. For many ancient civilisations quartz was a sacred mineral. The Ancients believed that quartz was the very consummation of nature, and its structure the basis of life on Earth. Indian yogis hold that quartz and the human being represent the culmination of evolution in the universe. Perhaps this is because of all the mineral kingdom quartz is most in tune with the human being. The Ancients believed that crystals of quartz radiate a divine white light, that they are the key giving entry to cosmic harmony, putting a person in touch with its vibrations. They are conductors of the pure energy of the cosmos, high frequency generators. Crystals are akin to the pyramids that co nnect people to the cos- mic consciousness. 13 Doctor Abatte-Pacha, vice-president of the Institute of Egyptology, and William Groff, a worker at the institute, once spent a whole night in the desert clos e to the pyramids. In the official account of this research Groff stated: “About eight p.m. I noticed a light, the source of which was slowly moving around the Great Pyramid near its very top. It resembled a low flame. The light passed around the pyr- amid three times and then disappeared. After that I attentively ob served that particular pyramid practi- cally the whole night and at about eleven the light appeared again, only this time it had taken on a somewhat pale blue hue. It slowly rose along the slope of the pyramid practically in a straight line and hung for a short time above its tip, after which it ag ain disappeared.” By persistently questioning the local Bedouins, Groff managed to find out that the mysterious light had been seen quite frequently in the past — tales about it went back into the depths of the centuries. The Arabs attribute it to the guard- ian spirits of the pyramid. Groff himself attempted to find a natural explanation for the phenomenon but without success. 14 A brochure entitled The Cylinders of the Pharaohs (1997 and 1998) presented a slightly different, sim- plified description of the structure of the “Energy Source” and its link with th e cylinders of the phar- aohs. Considering the fact that researchers from vari ous countries have come fairly close to solving the mystery of the Pyramid of Cheops, it is preferable to give a more detailed account of the structure of the “source” and a number of other elements lest they are destroyed by expeditions that are planned for the very near future. 15 For the sake of greater historical accuracy, here and below Ancient Egyptian names are given in the text followed by the Greek equivalents in brackets. 16 The symbolic meaning of the sculptural group can be read as follows: Horus and Isis (the two all-forming flows/sources of the BA-KA vital force) are the sources of energy needed by Osiris (the pharaoh) to become the ruler of the Duat. The basis of Ancient Egyptian theo logy was the idea that after deat h (leaving the body) the phar- aoh went up into the firmament an d became an “Osiris” (a traveller through the heavenly realm of the Duat). In other words, in order to journey through the heavenly Duat (the emergence and travelling of the astral body) the energy of Horus and Isis is n eeded (the active and harmonised BA-KA). If we take into account the Egyptians belief that their civilisation went back to a Golden Age when both king- doms were ruled by gods and the god Osiris was reckoned to be the first pharaoh, having assumed human form, then we can conclude that the practice of preparing pharaohs to journey in their “astral bodies” is very ancient indeed. 17 Against the background of the brief average life-span of the Ancient Egyptians — 25 to 30 years, the longevity of some priests and pharaohs is quite astonishing. Psamtik was on the throne for 51 years, Thutmose III for 54 years, Ramesses II for 67 years and Pepi II for 94 years! Naturally, given an aver- age life of 30 years, for three generations of ordinary Egyptians Pepi II would have seemed the embod- iment of immortality and divine superiority."},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"The Wands of Horus Notes & References . 88 Third Edition - December 2001 18 We have already mentioned the fact that frequencies are in resonance when the wavelength of one is an exact multiple of the wavelength of the other. For that reason, the cylinders intended to work with the Pyramid of Cheops were 146 mm long, one thousandth of the height of the pyramid. In other words, this type of cylinder was tuned to the pyramid. Incidentally, the figure 146 mm, or 0.146 m, is the fourth element in the descending br anch of the Golden Section sequence. It is worth also reminding the reader that the An cient Egyptian calendar had a cycle of 1460 (146 x 10) years. 1460 was the cycle of Sothis, which is ba sed on the heliacal rising of the star Sirius and its shift by one day every four years (of 365 days). The Ancient Egyptian year contained 1460 days (4x365=1460). 19 In 1968 a group of scientists from the USA and Cairo University set up detectors in the underground chambers of the Pyramid of Khaf-Ra (Chephren) to register the amount of cosmic radiation penetrat- ing through the thickness of the pyramid. The m easurements were taken around the clock for the period of a year. The results proved to be astonishing: each day the pattern of radiation was different and unique. 20 It is worth adding to the already existing definiti on of the Noosphere concept that it is a multi-dimen- sional, highly complex structure incorporating many sub-planes of existence. The souls of people who die on the Earth pass into the Noosphere, becoming a part of it. And we bring to the Noosphere all the positive and negative that we have stored up within ourselves over the course of our lives, thus deter- mining its quality and the problems of its development. It should be stressed that what people call Shambala is one of the highest sub-planes of the No osphere. Shambala is, in one of its manifestations, the “energetic space” created and inhab ited in by those who in their lives, deeds, thoughts and strivings embodied on Earth the will of the Creator and thro ugh whose lives and sufferings the Absolute itself draws closer to perfection. But the Noosphere is not only Shambala, after all not only people of great spirituality leave the Earth when they die. The Noosphere is us, only on another plane of exis tence. It should therefore be understood that sometimes a contact with the Noospher e is a contact with those who at some time lived on Earth, or on another planet. 21 Etymologically the word religion is made up of two elements: re meaning “establishment” and “ligio” meaning “connection”. That is to say “establishment of a connection” or the beginning of the process of interaction. A correct understanding of the word opens up a long-forgotten secret. 22 The “Canon” is a set of basic principles on which th e ancient hierophants’ conceptions of the universe were constructed. They form the foundation of the Law of Harmony. 23 Knowledge of destiny and the ability to foresee the future is a direct indication of the source of such knowledge and the pyramids were a tool to obtain that knowledge. In this connection it is worth noting that th e tales and myths of the North American Indians asserted that the people who lived before the flood could see through the earth and predict the future. [11 ] 24 Certain geological structures are connected with the energy processe s taking place in the cosmos and are therefore something like natural energy sources. The orientation of the pyramids in respect of the planet’s poles was a consequence of their attach- ment to particular energy flows coming from st ar systems, on which the Pyramid of Cheops, among others, was oriented. The southern shaft of the “Kin g’s Chamber” was directed at the belt of Orion, a constellation that was associated with Asar (Osiri s), while a shaft from the “Queen’s Chamber” was oriented on Sirius, the star of the goddess Aset (Isis ). The northern shaft, rising at an angle of 31 degrees to the horizontal, was oriented almost pr ecisely on the star now known as Alpha Draconis. This positioning was no coincidence and it also determined the pyramids orientation to the points of the compass. The determining factor, however, was not the points of the compass as such, but the alignment of the shafts with certain stars.

On an evolutionary scale, however, as psychic potential develops (the prog ramme of mutations encoded in the DNA of each of us) and the environment improves, the human immune system will also improve. Such mutations will accompany the shift of the human organism to the next evolutionary step. 26 We should immediately make clear that the Pyramidal Energy Structures referred to here will be rather different. Additional elements will be used in their construction, making it possible to correct the inad- equacies (or rather deliberate peculiarities) in the construction of the pyramids of the Giza complex. 27 The generally accepted title, “The Book of the Dead” is incorrect. The heading of the original work can be literally translated as “The Book of Those Who Rise by Day” or “The Chapters of Coming Forth by Day”. This kind of inexactitude in translation is a consequence of the fact that the scholars of ancient texts did not take into account the practises employed by the ancient pr iests during \"initations\". The ancient text is considered to be devoted to life after \"death\" and the necessary preparation for that transition. . But, in drawing that conclusion the researchers did not appreciate the reality that lay behind the texts. In point of fact the erroneously titled \"Book of the Dead\" speaks not of the deceased in a literal sense, but of those who have left their bodies during an \"initiation\" and made an \"astral journey\" while in a deep suggestive state. Separate fragments of the work in the form in which it has come down to us today are devoted magic rituals or metaphysics as such. The majority of the book is a description of the states passed through by the soul that has flown from the body, the trials awaiting it and its existence in subtler dimensions. In effect the main emphasis of the bo ok is no what happens to a person after \"death\" (coming forth from the body). [16 ] It should be noted that when a person “comes forth from the body” during a session of regressive hypnotism it seems to an observer that the subject parts with his life. At first the recumbent subject loses awareness of his body, then his speech become s retarded and his voice barely audible. It is remarkable that at some point the person who leaves his body speaks of a burst of bright daylight in front of him that is different from the usual kind. The events that follow can take different patterns, but the most interesting things always begin with that burst of bright white light. In Dr Raymond Moody’s book Life after Life people who had experienced clinical death told of flying along a “corridor” at the end of which they were met by “Divine light”. With that in mind it becomes cl ear why the “Book of the Dead”, which contains instructions for “the pharaoh who has left his body”, was called “The Chapters of Coming Forth by Day”. 28 Here we have briefly touched on the generally accepted theory of BA and KA, but this is only the vis- ible picture, the part accessible to th e majority in Ancient Egyptian society. In the religious doctrine of Ancient Egypt the BA-KA principle had many layers of meaning. BA and KA were component elements not only of the human being, but of everything that existed. They were considered to embody a human being’s vital force in life and to continue to exist after death. The KA was viewed not only as a vital force, but also as a kind of twin, an “alter-ego” inseparable form a person after death as well. The Ancient Egyptians saw everything in the world as a duality a “two-in- one”, and where there are two elemen ts there is an interaction. Accordingly, the BA-KA principle was knowledge about the connection between the physical plane and the energy plane, the world into which a person passes after death and with which there is a permanent interconnection. For that very reason everything in Ancient Egypt was subordinated to this principle. It should be emphasised that in general the Ancient Egyptians viewed the world from a position of principles. ✟ An indication that they thought of the dual nature of the universe as a principle, as some kind of funda- mental phenomenon of divine origin (i.e., primordial, given from on high and inherent in all things) is contained, for example, in one of the fragments of the legend about the death of Heru (Horus): “I am Aset (Isis) and I have emerged from the pris on in which my brother Set (Seth) confined me. For the god Tehuti (Thoth), the great god, the leader of the Maat, both in heaven and on earth, said to me: ‘Go, o Aset, goddess, besides that there is on e more thing that is worth listening to, because he shall be alive who follows the advice of others. Hi de together with your young son (Horus) and that will come to him. His members will grow and double strength of all kinds will enter into him...”"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"The Wands of Horus Notes & References . 90 Third Edition - December 2001 The BA-KA as a symbol of the dualistic thinking of the Ancients can be traced even in the struc- ture of the state and society. Egypt consisted of tw o parts: the southern, upper kingdom with two capi- tals — Nekhen and Nekheb, and the northern, lower kingdom, again with a double capital — Dep and Pe. The evidence surviving from that period conveys an emphatically dualistic vision of the world. The pattern of recording (encoding) and expounding (decoding) knowledge (information) followed the same principle. Suffice it to recall the eleven boards found in the tomb of Hesi-Ra, where information was presented on both the front and back. In turn the information recorded on each of the sides by means of dots was also presented in the pulsating BA-K a rhythm. It is certain that this principle and no other lay at the basis of the Heliopolis doctrine of eternal dualism. The same BA-KA principle can also be detected in the architecture of Ancient Egypt. After stud- ying many texts describing the burial process it beco mes evident that the heaven ly Duat of the Ancient Egyptians had its equivalent on Earth. In other words, the Ancient Egyptians viewed the region of the Memphis necropolis as an earthly reflection of th e heavenly Duat and the great pyramid complex on the Giza plateau was the gateway to the heavenly Duat. The labyrinthine funeral temple of Amenemhat III in the Fayum nome (district) contained 3,000 rooms — 1,500 above ground and 1,500 below. (Herodotus’ History ) ✟ A principle is understood as being something that completely inevitably and unconditionally reveals itself at all levels of the organisation of material, in contrast to laws that have only a localised sphere of application. 29 Translated from the Ancient Egyptian, “akh” means “blissful”, “enlightened”. 30 It should be noted that in Ancient Egypt carbon and ferro-magnetic material were not used as a filling for the Wands of Horus . This filling is a later refinement. We shall call this type of cylinder Wands of Horus Kont in honour of the Polish researcher Comte (Count) Walewski who first informed humanity about this type of cylinder back at the beginning of the twentieth century. 31 In Ancient Egypt the Wands of Horus were filled with quartz crystals of differing sizes. The size of the crystals depending on the task they were seekin g to accomplish, the state of the health and energy system of the user. In the initial phase fine-grain quartzites (a special white sand) were used. Cylinders containing white sand have a positive effect on a person’s energy channels, activating them. Then the Ancients used medium- and large-grained quartzites, raising their energy systems to a higher level of potential. We shall call this type of cylinder Wands of Horus Crystal and Wands of Horus Mono . The following variety of Wands of Horus contained monocrystalline quartz. This type of cylin- der was intended for priestly healers. The energy “cocoon” created by this ty pe can have a powerful harmonising effect on the patient, at one and the sa me time implementing and relaying a signal origi- nating in the healer’s consciousness. We shall call this type of cylinder Wands of Horus Crystal . Besides these, the Ancients used one further vari ety of cylinder that contained monocrystals of quartz selected in a special manner and processed in a special way. Cylinders containing such crystals were something like miniature “energy sources”, inte nded to provide energy an d strengthen the effect of psychic efforts. We shall call this type of cylinder Wands of Horus Source . 32 One of the causes of the gradual closing of the chakra is the prevailing ecological situation. The clos- ing is a normal reaction of the organism, a protec tion against the penetration of damaging types of radiation. 33 In a normal healthy the boundary of the first energy body is about 50–70 centimetres from the physical body. If the field is less than 30–40 centimetres thick, it indicates a disorder of one or other organ or a partial disruption of the person’s energy balance. If the field drops to 15–20 centimetres a person may have a seriously disrupted energy balance, even leading to fainting and loss of consciousness. In most cases, however, we find headaches, vertigo and nausea, as the energy balance is directly linked to blood pressure."},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"The Wands of Horus Notes & References . 91 Third Edition - December 2001 34 At roughly 37° Celsius, the average temperature of warm-blooded animals, th e most highly-developed living creatures, free water exists in a unique condition where exactly half the inter-tetramer hydrogen bonds are broken (Koliasnikov 1990b). This ensures the equal probability of the direction and manage- ment of reversible biochemical reactions by micro- gradients of temperature in different parts of the body. This state of water also corresponds to a predom inance within it of microstructural chains in which again half the hydrogen bonds that combine with bio-polymers are free. In this case the com- bined water in the blood system forms a sort of endless “multicore cable” which almost instantane- ously conveys information about the state of any organ, or even cell to the “command centre” — the brain (hypothalamus, hypophasis), which then gives its response to the pathological state. [10 ] 35 In order to demonstrate that the pyramid’s structuring field does have an effect specifically on the crys- tal lattice, making it more regular (fewer impurities) we cite an experiment carried out with ordinary water. Several plastic vessels containing distilled water were placed inside the pyramid and the state of the water was observed throughout the three winter months. The water did not freeze and retained all its liquid properties for the entire period. The lowest air temperature within the pyramid was minus 38° Celsius. Measurements of the temperature of the wa ter inside the vessels showed that it corresponded to the temperature inside the pyramid. In other words, the water did not freeze even when its own tem- perature was –38°C. Ordinary mineral water in plastic bottles behaved in the same way. It should be noted that if the vessels were shaken or jolted while being examined, crystallisation began inside and the water turned to ice in between 2 and 20 seconds (depending on the degree of supercooling at the time). 36 The spiral is a resonant shape. It is a topological invariant (direct consequence) of the diagonal of a rectangle or the hypotenuse of a right-angled triang le. Constructing such a spiral in a circle, then returning, completing the cycle of there and back, BA and KA, we arrive at proof that Pythagoras’ Theorem is a fundamental theorem, that reveals the idea of the resonance phenomenon as the har- monic principle on which the whole universe is constructed. 37 The god Horus(Heru) in Ancient Egyptian religion was a symbol of harmony. Horus was the “hypote- nuse” in the Sacred Triangle in which Isis and Osiris were the other two sides. The hypotenuse is the harmonising element. Therefore everything in Anci ent Egypt that was connected with harmony or har- monisation was linked with the name of Horus. Thus the cylinders that the priests and pharaohs used to harmonise the BA-KA energy system were called “Wands of Horus”. 38 The 1460-year So this cycle was calculated from obse rvations of the heliacal rising (that most nearly coincident with the Sun yet still visible) of the star Sirius (Sothis) and its shift by one day every four years with a 365-day calendar. The complete cycle therefore takes 4 x 365 = 1460 years. 39 Ordinary paper, cardboard or wooden mini-pyramids do not produce the required effect in this case. Best of all for personal use are mini-pyramids made of glass. 40 The energy matrix is a sort of energy framework or skeleton. Each energy body contains within it the matrix of the most important systems in the human organism. For example, the first (ethereal) energy body contains the matrix of the peripheral nervous system. As they form and grow the tissues of the human organism develop in a sort of copy of this energy “skeleton”, forming the structure of the organs. And while the function of the blood is connected with the vital activities of the organism, the energy canals carry information regulating the activities of the endocrine, exocrine and other systems. 41 Since the human brain is capable of perceiving info rmation within a certain range of frequencies, the mirror reflectors installed in the shafts transforme d the incoming energy flow into waves in the range accessible to the human brain. 42 Here are just a few examples. One of the very earli est pyramid texts expresses the idea of the endless- ness of space. In the noted Leyden Papyrus we find the words: “Look... the Earth is before me like a round ball.” Besides demonstrating that the Ancient Egyptians knew the Earth was spherical, it also"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"The Wands of Horus Notes & References . 92 Third Edition - December 2001 indicates that someone viewed our planet from somewh ere beyond it! And that is only possible either by flying in a space ship or by flying “in the astral body” during an act of dedication or initiation con- ducted by the hierophants. The Ancient Egyptian texts state that in its motion the Earth obeys the same lays as the other planets — Jupiter, Saturn, Mars, Mercury and Venus. And they also believed that the Sun, which later European science considered immobile, moved through the Universe and called it “a ball swimming in the bowels of the goddess Nut”. 43 The Ancient Egyptian list of heavenly denizens was qu ite extensive. It included, besides the person- ages often encountered, the Ashemu who were, as far as can be made out, something like ethereal creatures. The heavens were also the dwelling-place of the Khenmemet — being who were either des- tined to become people or had alread y been through a human incarnation. Professor Wallis Budge asserted that the word ashem usually denotes a form “in which a god becomes visible”, although at the same time the noted scholar expressed the opinion that the term must have a more ancient, long-forgotten meaning. [12 ] 44 The Mayas and Toltecs were splendid surgeons and anaesthesiologists. They had a good knowledge of human anatomy. The Ancient Egyptians, for their pa rt, had profound conceptions about human energy structure (the BA-KA principle). 45 Some of the legends about the Egyptian gods resemble modern action movies. 46 In this sentence “spirituality” should not be equated with “religiosity”. 47 It should, for example, be remembered that the ancient Mayas and Incas knew astronomy and mathe- matics and performed highly complex surgical operations, while their descendants did not even know about the wheel. [14 ] 48 According to even later beliefs, far from every human being possessed a Ba — a soul, the “subtle means of translocation” necessary to ascend to the next level of spiritual development. The right to possess a soul had to be earned over many lifetimes: until a person achieved it, he was compelled to remain within the earthly bounds. 49 It is quite common among UFO researchers to test the information obtained by a person during a “close encounter” by means of regressive hypnosis . The subject is placed in a state that gives the researcher access to blocked or deeply forgotten information. It is remarkable that when a person is being pu t into a hypnotic state everything begins with a sense of bodily lightness (occasionally heaviness), then the person leaves his or her body, seeing it from the side. Very frequently the subject finds hims elf in a strange corridor, after which he comes out into open cosmic space. UFO researchers using this technique know of dozens of cases when the sub- ject’s onward flight to a nearby star (or specifically to Orion) and his visit to some planet made it pos- sible to establish contact with a representative of that planet. The resulting conversation provided interesting information. In this technique the ufolog ist always acts as an instructor, directing the sub- ject (especially a novice) and ex plaining what is happening to him and how he should behave. 50 In many Coffin Texts there are descriptions of strang e corridors, crossroads that confuse the souls of the dead and also dangerous waters that can be cros sed only with the aid of the Ferryman. In order to overcome these and other obstacles, the dead need to know a password, while the celebrant priests were supposed to help dispose of these and many ot her secret obstructions, because only in that way could they be of use to the dead. 51 A study of the rituals of the Incas and Mayas that go back to the more profound religious views of their distant ancestors convinces one that the most venerated object of their worship was undoubtedly light, embodied by the sun. In the world view of Ancient Egypt the sun-god Ra was the first — the father and creator of all the other gods, the creator of all that exists, indivi sible and uncreated. The race that originated from the “first time” (Tep Zepi) considered light the closes t substance to God in this crude material world."},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"The Wands of Horus Notes & References . 93 Third Edition - December 2001 The Book of Genesis says that in the beginning God created light — th e element without which further creation is impossible. 52 Dr C. Jacques informs us of many details of the priestly initiation rite drawn from the “Leyden Magic Papyrus”. To all appearances the readiness of the candidate was assessed on the basis of his esoteric knowledge rather than practical skills that could be developed later. Particular account was taken of his highest ability to commune with “the light of the beginning of beginnings”. It was considered that this accomplishment in itself contained magic in its absolute ly pure form. From the very outset the initiate had explained to him that every event which he enco untered had its reflection in the “divine world”. In other words, any event that took place on Earth was connected with events taking place on the “subtle plane”. It was for that very reason that knowledge about the gods, theology, mythology, the creation of this and other worlds was considered of extreme importance. The initiate had to grasp these principles and master them because during the ritual a man might, for example, come across his own id , which quite often took the form of some monster or evil genius. As soon as the future priest proved capable of establishing contact with that form of divinity to whose service he was dedicating himself, he automatically came into the protection an d keeping of that divin- ity. [13 ] All the above accords astonishingly well with th e experience obtained today from conducting sessions of regressive hypnosis. A person leaving the body does indeed encounter some kind of white light — the selfsame “light of the beginning of beginnings”. It is far from every person who manages to approach it and speak to it mentally. Any false step in your thoughts and it immediately disappears. During “astral flights” a person encounters various beings and can chose to make contact with any of them. It is important (with rare exceptions) that the desire to make contact is positively returned and in that case it can be continued. All that is needed is mutual consent and adherence to certain conditions. The being with whom contact is made will gladly pr ovide advice, heal and warn of danger. The invita- tion to make contact as a rule takes the form of an “impulse”, a shift of state. The person suddenly feels an attack of sleepiness or, on the contrary, an astonishing influx of energy. At the same time he/ she senses a call or invitation from someone. Fu rther contacts take place according to the scheme already established. 53 Alexander Piankov, a translator of the Pyramid Text s, believed that the texts speak for themselves and are religious views and symbols. They were intend to guarantee a return to (bodily) life of the late pharaoh, in the same way as Os iris-Orion came back to life. The hieroglyphic texts call those who have undergone the initiation “twice-born” and they could add the title “resurrected to life” to their names. In the Book of the Dead the name of Osiris was placed in front of the names of those who had undergone initiation. A certain parallel can bet drawn here with the reading of the Tibetan Book of the Dead . 54 Preparation for such a ritual involved a host of rituals. It should not be forgotten that in order to avoid the pyramid and its influence (the powerful field) ha ving a negative effect on the pharaoh’s psycholog- ical and physical make-up, his organism had to be prepared appropriately. Ap propriate diets were fol- lowed and pharaohs and priests regularly used cylinders with quartz fillings and a number of other elements that improved the energy and immune systems. 55 The Bedouin living alongside the pyramids in the village of Giza have a host of legends about spirits and ghosts wandering at night in the Valley of the Sphinx, which the Bedouin consider the most evil- ridden place in the whole wide world. 56 Practically throughout the Book of the Dead , the expression “dead king” should not be taken literally. “Dead” here means having left the left the body, performing an “astral” journey. When the Egyptian Book of the Dead refers to the dead it mean s just such people, who have entered a trance so deep that it can easily be compared with death: their bodies are immobile and life- less and their souls are away in another world. What is being described is the initiation ritual. The most ancient of the sacred Egyptian texts, the Book of the Dead , is in its present form a mix- ture of works of the most varied kind, which speak of the dead and of the pseudo-dead (initiates) and the resultant confusion is inevitable. The fact that in its most ancient, genuine, undistorted form this"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"The Wands of Horus Notes & References . 94 Third Edition - December 2001 book told of those very rites is in part demonstrated by the following passage: “This book is about the greatest of mysteries. May the gaze of not a single (uninitiated) person fall upon it — that would be bad for it. Keep its existence a secret. The Book of the Teacher of the Secret Temple is its name.” This Book is indeed a veritable mystery. Let no stranger anywhere have knowledge of it. Do not speak about it to any man. Do not repeat it. Let no [other] eye see it. Let no [other] ear hear it. Let no one see it except [thyself] and him who taught [it to thee]. Let not the multitude [know of it] (Budge's translation) More over the deceased (in reality the initiated) in the Book of the Dead constantly prefixes his own name with that of Osiris. In the earliest versions of this ancient text, the deceased says of himself: “I am Osiris. I have moved forward, as have you. I live as the gods live!”. This confirms the truth of the interpretation of the mythical death of Osiris as an initiation by passing through a comatose state that outwardly resembles death. 57 It is a noteworthy fact that the throne of Osiris was always depicted standing “in water”. There is a mention of Herodotus having heard a story from Egyptian priests that was beneath the Great Pyramid a system of canals connected with the waters of the Nile. 58 The signal-carrying mechanism also involves the Earth’s crust. The outermost portion of the lithos- phere consists to 72% by weight of feldspars and quartz. 59 A honest, unprejudiced examination of the existing material relating to the development of our civili- sation, including not only history and archaeology, bu t also astronomy, geology, oceanology, geometry and a number of other disciplines, does not leav e even the shadow of a doubt that the knowledge received in their time by ancient ci vilisations was of cosmic origin. 60 The most complex aspects of the information passed to mankind entered the minds of priests and sha- mans in the form of myths during the performance of magic rituals and religious rites. After the removal of the overlay of primitive shamanistic view s, the mythological plots of many of the world’s peoples and the events that unfold in the myths take on another meaning, indicating that the tales that appeared in ancient times contained, in veiled form , a particular conception of the evolution of man- kind and the universe. 61 By projection we mean human being. In order to describe the method of research using “projections”, let us, purely hypothetically, imagine the Creator as the most up-to-date computer on which the very latest program is installed. The computer and the program are made in such a way that they can test and improve themselves and, by building up certain experience (a database) autonomously change their own parameters to take account of the data (variants) obtained. In order to test and make known all the program’s possibilities, both evident and concealed, the computer autonomously creates within itself a large number of mini-p rograms (projections of the main program). Those mini-programs, carrying out all possibl e operations in all the blocks and systems, in all possible variations reveal weaknesses and strengths, studying the principles that were laid in the basis of the idea of the program and of the computer itself. Thus, after a given amount of time, when all possible variations have been calculated, a new-generation program with maximum stability and a striving to self-knowledge and self-improvement will be developed. 62 In creating human beings following a single genetic code (his own), the Creator evidently here again drew on the BA–KA principle, envisaging two types of genetics. The first is the genetics of the physi- cal shell (the DNA code) that we acquire from our parents. The second is the genetics of the energy shell that a person forms in the process of his or her transformations. It is extremely interesting that in his 1978 book The Molecular Biology of the Gene James Watson examined in detail the question of the coding matrix that might have been some macro-mole- cules, intermediaries between acids and the synthesising proteins that are, as we know, the basis of all life. These intermediaries are, acco rding to Watson, undoubtedly present in all cells, but the pretender to the role of matrix (God) proved literally invisible. It is still unknown today, although evidently"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"The Wands of Horus Notes & References . 95 Third Edition - December 2001 responsible for the coding of proteins and each of the twenty natural amino-aci ds that make them up. The drama of the search for this elusive matrix su bstances led Watson to the unconsoling conclusion that even at our current stage it is impossible to settle the question of how the genetic code arose. 63 R.A. Schwaller de Lubicz draws our attention to the f act that the hieroglyph used to denote Unas (last pharaoh of the fifth dynasty) translates as Univ ersal Consciousness, cons tantly swallowing and processing its own energy, of which our bodies and souls are tiny fragments. 64 Encoded in the DNA is a programme of genetic muta tions and phaseal transitions that take place as a the human being’s mind improves and energy potential grows. 65 Here are a few traces of that ancient knowledge that found reflection in the Ancient Egyptian myth of the creation: “Ra, or Ra-Tem, rose from the Nunu (the primaeval waters covered by the dry land) and began sailing on the Boat of Millions of Years .” (“Sailing” means the beginning of movement in the universe (finding out about himself). Movement presupposes that the events take place in space and time, in other words are accessible to the senses. The universe begins to exist as a mass of moving beings (pro- jections). That movement was preceded by the original state of being without any sort of form outside of time and space. “After appearing Ra created everything that ar ose from his being and he was inside of his crea- tion as in his body.” Having created the universe out of himself, the Supreme Being, directed his Eye (mind) into that which had been created. Then the mind “became lost” in creatio n and turned into the souls of human beings and all forms of life, having forgotten about its true identity. The Eye lost in creation is the human soul caught up in the cy cle of reincarnations (“birth–death–birth”) as a result of loss of memory and distraction (ignorance of its true natu re). The Supreme Being (Ra) despatched the mes- senger of wisdom (Thoth) in the forms of Metu Nether (the ancient doctri ne of wisdom) and Sbai (spiritual mentors — gurus) to inform the Eye of its true nature. “Remembering” what it really is, the Eye returns to its fitting place. [18 ] Spell 261 of the pyramid texts is headed “To become a magus”. This is what it says: “Again the initiate addresses the magi in the presence of the Master of the Universe. Is he not one of those whom the Sole Lord created even before two foods [ sic ], day and night, good and evil appeared on the Earth, when the Creator opened in secl usion His only eye? The magus presents himself as the one who directs the Word. He is the son of the Great Mother — the one who gave life to the Creator on this Earth, but who nonetheless has no mother.” Christian Jacq, Egyptian Magic 66 The level of development of each projection multiplied by the number of projections. 67 The All-Seeing Eye that the pharaohs and priests obse rved during their astral journeys was that very eye through which everything that is happening is constantly being watched watched by the Creator. Thus the All-Seeing Eye is not simply a symbol, but a real aspect of existence. It is for just this reason that we find depictions of the Eye of Ra and the Eye of Horus on many Ancient Egyptian monuments, while priests and phar aohs made up their eyes in such a way as to remind others that God looks at the world through the eyes of the human being."},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"The Wands of Horus Notes & References . 96 Third Edition - December 2001 68 One further interesting aspect conn ected with the beliefs of the Dogo n tribe about Sirius can be found in the very nature and significance of their Sirius cult. Its meaning has echoes, on the one hand, of the idea that the soul is in constant s earch for its double, and, on the other, with that of the human being’s incessant striving for individuality (for the union of the anima and the animus ) in the name of achiev- ing true knowledge, attaining wisdom and perfection. 69 I n modern terminology — to the same (as His own) genetic code. The central ideas of Christianity have origins deep in Egyptian antiquity. Their es sence springs from the ancient knowledge of God. This makes understandable the statements found in the gospels: “I and the Father are one. ... Jesus answered them, ‘Is it not written in your law, ‘I said you are gods’?’” ( John 10, 30 & 34 ). “Be still,” the psalmist says, “and know that I am God.”"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"The Wands of Horus Third Edition - December 2001 Bibliography . 97 Bibliography 1 I.P.
