While all these newly organized associations do some good in preparing the minds of thoughtful people for their eventually becoming genuine disciples of the One Truth, ye t there is but ONE ancient organization of Mystics which shows to the student a Royal Road to discover the One Truth.

It is recorded in symbol, parable and allegory , requiring a Key for its interpretation. The symbols of Freemasonry were originally derived from the more ancient mysteries, as all who have travelled the burning sands know. The ritual and ceremonies, signs and passwords have been preserved with great fidelity: but the Real Key has been long lost to the crowds who have been initiated, advanced and raised in Masonry. The KEY to this knowledge can, however, be placed within the reach of all those who unselfishly desire, study and work for its possession. The Symbols of Ancient Masonry, the Sacred Art of the Ancient Chemi (Egyptians), and Homer's Golden Chain are but different aspects of the One Great Mystery. They represent but different degrees of initiation. By the Right Use of the “Key” alone the “Ma ster Word” can be found. In order to afford genuine seekers after Hermetic Truth some information on the aims of the Ancient Order of Oriental Templars, we now print the preliminary instruction issued by the Fratres of this Order. FIRST INSTRUCTION To all whom it may concern — Let it be known that there exists, unknown to the great crowd, a very ancient order of sages, whose object is the amelioration and spiritual elevation of mankind, by means of"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"ORDER OF ORIENTAL TEMPLARS ix conquering error, and aiding men and women in their effo rts of attaining the power of recognizing the truth. This order has existed already in the most remote and prehistoric times; and it has manifested its activity secretly and openly in the world under different names and in various forms; it has caused social and political revolutions, and proved to be the rock of salvation in times of danger and misfortune. It has always upheld the banner of freedom against tyranny, in whatever shape this appeared, whether as clerical or political, or social despotism or oppression of any kind. To this secret order every wise and spiritually enlightened person belongs by right of his or her nature; because they all, even if they are personally unknown to each other, are one in their purpose and object, and they all w ork under the guidance of the one light of truth. Into this sacred society no one can be admitted by another, unless he has the power to enter it him - self by virtue of his own interior illumination: neither can any one, after he has once entered, be expe lled, unless he should expel himself by becoming unfaithful to his principles, and forget again the truths which he has learned by his own experience. All this is known to every enlightened person; but it is known only to few that there exists also an ext ernal, visible organization of such men and women who, having themselves found the path to real self - knowledge, are willing to give to others, desirous of entering that path, the benefit of their experience and to act as spiritual guides to those who are w illing to be guided.

In regard to the spiritual aspect of this secret order, one of the Brothers says — “Our community has existed ever since the first day of creation when the gods spoke the divine command: ‘Let there be light!’ and it will continue to exist till the end of time. It is the Society of the Children of Light, who live in the light and have attained immortality therein. In our school we are instructed directly by Divine W isdom, the Celestial Bride, whose will is free and who selects as her disciples those who are devoted to her. The mysteries which we are taught embrace everything that can possibly be known in regard to God, Nature and Man. Every sage that ever existed i n the world has graduated at our school; for without wisdom no man can be wise. We all study only one book, the Book of Nature, in which the keys to all secrets are con - tained, and we follow the only possible method in studying it, that of experience. O ur place of meeting is the Temple of the Holy Spirit pervading the universe; easily to be found by the elect, but for ever hidden from the eyes of the vulgar. Our secrets cannot be sold for money, but we give them free to every one capable to receive the m.” As to the external organization of that society, it will be necessary to give a glance at its history, which has been one and the same in all. Whenever that spiritual society manifested itself on the outward plane and appeared in the world, it consi sted at its beginning of a few able and en - lightened people, forming a nucleus around which others were"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"ORDER OF ORIENTAL TEMPLARS xi attracted. But invariably, the more such a society grew in numbers, the more became attracted to its elements, such as were not able to understand or f ollow its principles; people who joined it for the purpose of gratifying their own ambition or for making the society serve their own ends obtained the majority over those that were pure. Thereupon the healthy portion of it retired from the field and con tinued their benevolent work in secrecy, while the remaining portion became diseased and disrupted, and sooner or later died disgraced and profaned. For the Spirit had departed from them. For this reason the external organization of which we speak has r esolved not to reveal its name or place to the vulgar. Furthermore, for the same reason, the names of the teachers and members of this society shall remain unknown, except to such as are intimately associated with them in their common work. If it is said that in this way the society will gain only few members, it may be answered that our society has a spiritual head, and that those who are worthy of being admitted will be guided to it by means of their intuition; while those who have no intuition are no t ripe for it and not needed. It is better to have only a comparatively small number of capable members than a great many useless ones. From the above it will be clear that the first and most necessary acquirement of the new disciple is that he will kee p silent in regard to all that concerns the society to which he is admitted. Not that there is anything in that Society which needs to be afraid of being known to the virtuous and good; but it is not necessary that things which are elevated and"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"THE EQUI NOX xii sacred s hould be exposed to the gaze of the vulgar, and be bespattered by them with mud. This would only impede the society in its work. Another necessary requirement is mutual confidence be - tween the teacher and the disciple; because a disciple who has no fait h in his master cannot be taught or guided by him. There may be things which will appear strange, and for which no reasons can be given to the beginner; but when the disciple has attained to a certain state of development all will be clear to him or her . The confidence which is required will also be of little service if it is only of a short duration. The way of development of the soul, which leads to the awakening of the inner senses, is slow, and without patience and fortitude nothing will be accomp lished. From all this it follows as a matter of course that the next requisite is obedience. The purpose of the disciple is to obtain the mastery over his own lower self, and for this reason he must not submit himself to the will of his lower nature, but follow the will of that higher nature, which he does not yet know, but which he desires to find. In obeying the will of the master, instead of following the one which he believes to be his own, but which is in reality only that of his lower nature, he ob eys the will of his own higher nature with which his master is associated for the purpose of aiding the disciple in attaining the conquest over himself. The conquest of the higher self over the lower self means the victory of the divine consciousness in m an over that which in him is earthly and animal. Its object is a realization of true manhood and womanhood, and the attainment of conscious immortality in the realization of the highest state of existence in perfection."},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"ORDER OF ORIENTAL TEMPLARS xiii These few preliminary remarks may be sufficient for those who desire information concerning our order; to those who feel themselves capable to apply for admission, further instructions will be given.

Requiescat in Pace! We are obliged to the Universal Freemason for the following Memorial Article: In the death of Brother John Yarker, of Didsbury, Manchester, England, whom the Great Architect of the Universe called from Labour in March last, Masonry has lost her greatest living authority on high grades, of all of which Brother Yarker was a Past Master, an ardent devotee, and on which he was a voluminous writer. We had the honour of Brother Yarker’s acquaintance nearly three decades ago, he having been a contributor to the Scottish Free - mason when we edited that journal. The following leading events in Brother Yarker’s Masonic career we quote from the Co - Mason , of London, England: It was in Manchester that Brother Yarker entered on his Mas onic career and took up those studies which were to make him famous throughout the world in his after - life. He was initiated at the age of 21 in the Lodge of Integrity, No. 189 , Manchester, on the 25 th day of October, 1854 , and after an interval of thre e months was duly Passed and Raised. The year after saw him occupying the Senior Warden's Chair of the Lodge of Fidelity, No. 623 †, and in 1857 he was elected Master of this Lodge. He still retained his membership of his Mother Lodge and served as Secreta ry in 1856 ; other offices were offered, but he resigned in 1862 . He entered Mark Masonry at Mottram in 1855 , and took also the Ark and Link degrees, and became the first Worshipful Master of the Fidelity Lodge of Mark Masters, No. 31 . In 1856 he was exal ted to the degree of a Royal Arch Mason in the Industry Chapter, No. 466 ‡, and became P.Z. of the Chapter of Fidelity in 1858 , and occupied the same office in the Industry Chapter for two years: 1861 , 1862 ."},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX xx When he was 23 years of age he was installed a K night Templar in the Jerusalem Conclave on the 11 th of July, 1856 . In 1861 he was elected Commander of the Love and Friendship Precep - tory, Stockport, and in 1863 , succeeding Brother William Romaine Callendar, M.P., D.L, he became the Commander of the J erusalem Conclave. Further honours fell to his share, and he was elected Grand Vice - Chancellor of the Province under Brother William Courtenay Cruttenden, P.G.C., and in 1864 was appointed Grand Constable of England. In the same year he was called abroad on commercial business and travelled extensively in America, the West Indies and Cuba. Before he left England he revived the old York degrees of Heredom - Kadosh, formerly worked under the Duke of Sussex, being helped in this important work by old members who had been admitted in 1823 and 1833 . In 1869 he was admitted into L'Ordre du Temple, the continuation of the Knights Templars in Paris. This body claims an uninterrupted succession of Grand Masters from the time of Jacques de Molay, who, it is said, invested as Grand Master Marc Larmenius in 1307 , when the Order was first impugned, before he himself perished at the stake. Later, Admiral Sir Sidney Smith, and several scions of the French Royal Family, were Grand Masters. It was a time of much activ ity, a Masonic Renaissance, in which the Very Illustrious Brother John Yarker played an important rôle, and many other old Rites were rescued from the oblivion into which they had fallen — such were the Rite of Mizraim, the degree of Ark Mariners, the Red C ross of Constantine, Babylon, Palestine, Philippi, etc., and, the most notable of all, the Ancient and Primitive Rite which was established by him in Manchester in 1871 . Very properly, therefore, we find that in 1870 the Royal Grand Council of Ancient Rit es appointed him Royal Grand Superintendent of Lancashire of these and other old Orders. For his Masonic scholarship and literary work, he was elected a member of the Masonic Archaeological Institute at its establish - ment in 1862 . The same year he was cr eated a Sovereign Prince Rose Croix of the Palatine Chapter of the A. and A. Rite by Brother Cruttenden, M. W., but as their claims conflicted with the old Templar grades he ceased attending. It would be impossible to enumerate all the offices he held a nd all the honours that were bestowed upon him; here, however, is a short list of the more important: Royal Grand Commander of the Rose Croix and Kadosh, 1868 to 1874 .

Early in his career V ∴∴ Illust ∴∴ Br ∴∴ John Yarker turned his attention to literature. He was a prolific writer on many subjects other than Masonic. In 1869 he compiled “Notes on the Temple and Hospital, and the Jerusalem Encampment, Manchester” — the Provincial Grand Conclave appreciated this work and complimented the author. Two years later saw an interesting work from his pen, Notes on the Scientific and Religious Mysteries of Antiquity; the Gnosis and Secret Schools of the Middle Ages, Modern Rosicrucianism; and the var ious Rites and Degrees of Free and Accepted Masonry , a book which has been exceedingly well reviewed. A little later, but about the same date, the “Egyptian Ritual of the Book of the Dead,” another paper on the Old Rosicrucian Doctrines and one on Astrol ogy, made their appearance. All this time articles were being written for the Masonic perodicals, and from 1855 up to the present time the best journals considered it an honour to publish his writings. These therefore can be found in the Freemason's Ma gazine , Free - mason , Freemason's Chronicle , Kneph (which he edited from 1885 ), the Transactions of Quatuor Coronati Research Lodge, and latterly in this maga - zine. Being much interested in Heraldry and Genealogical studies, he complied in 1881 a book o n the pedigree of the House of Yarker, containing much interesting information in regard to the origin, name and allied families in York, Westmorland and Lancashire. In 1909 the Arcane Schools , an epoch - making book, was produced. It is the flower of his devotion to the Craft, and the crown of all his labours, so in accord with his family motto, “the end crowns the work!” The data for this book took years to collect, and the result is monumental — an immense array of facts, systematically arranged, which f orm a valuable reference book. In it he traces the sources of the teaching of the philosophy and rites of the Craft, right back into the night of time — before the Aryan civilization. The mystery tradition was the sole survivor in the West, and in the Op erative Guilds a genuine mystery tradition was preserved and handed down to modern times. This splendid book carries conviction in every line, and all brethren who take a serious interest in Masonry should study it."},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"IN MEMORIAM — JOHN YARKER xxiii [ This Manifesto following has been iss ued by order of the new M.I.

A LTHOUGH the Sovereign Gra nd Master General departed this life on March 20 , 1913 , no official notice of the fact was sent out by the senior active officer, the Grand Chancellor General; but a few days after he had received the summons issued in default of such action by the Acting Sovereign Grand Master General, he sent another summons couched in similar terms, calling a special Convocation at Manchester for 4 p.m., June 28 , 1913 . This was illegal for two reasons: First, because Article XI of the Constitution provides that twenty days’ notice must be given; secondly, because by Article II the Grand Administrator General or his substitute had not fulfilled the conditions there imposed upon him, and because notices were not issued to all the Prince Patriarch Grand Conservators of the Rite. Brother Crowley, however, attended in order to protest against the illegalities. He further found a person claiming admission whose status he knew to be doubtful. The proceedings therefore began and ended with the following speech: Very Illustri ous Prince Patriarch Grand Conservators of the Sovereign Sanctuary of the Antient and Primitive Rite, Although I rise to protest against the illegality of the present Convocation, it is not in order to quibble over the letter of our Constitution that I have left my peaceful encampment in the Valley of Paris. When I see illegality, I ask myself, What has prompted it?"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX xxviii and in this case, the Chancellery fortunately reposing in the trained legal hands of Very Illustrious Brother Higham, it is certain that no inadvertence has been committed. I pass over therefore the breach of Article II and Article XI, which render this Convocation powerless to proceed to the business for which it purports to have been summoned, and I ask at whose instigation these illegalit ies have been committed? There is not one of you who is ignorant of the answer. The age and infirmity of our lamented Grand Hierophant allowed him to yield to improper persuasion, to be deceived by an intrigue no wilier than those he had so often defeated in his prime, and to relax the strict rules of our Constitution. Even to this exalted Sanctuary there has been admitted, in flagrant violation of Article VI of our Constitution, a man who is not and never was a member of a lodge in good standing workin g under a Grand lodge of Free and Accepted Masons. The Sanctuary must be purged. But it is not for this that I have left my very pleasant encampment in the Valley of Paris. Were the man of whom I speak a man free and of good report, I should perhaps hav e held my peace. I am not here to stickle even for the fundamentals of our Rite. But he is not even a free man, but the hired tool of a woman. Do you wonder if I protest that a woman — and women are excluded even from symbolic Masonry — should seek the usur pation of our Sovereignty? And yet this alone would not have induced me to exchange the amenities of my encampment in the Valley of Paris for the sterner and gloomier grandeurs of the Valley of Manchester.

This woman — pollution to that pure word! — comes to us from the nauseous fraud by which she made herself the real if not the nominal mistress of the T.S., the fraud which did not shrink from profaning the death - bed of that master - fool of the movement, who was at least unquestionably honest. Is it then to defeat her intrigues that I am come to this Valley of Manchester from my peaceful encampment in the Valley of Paris? No, a thousand times No! Let our Rite, the heir of all secular glory, be soiled and degraded by this creature as she will; I for one will not lower visor or lay lance in rest.

This is the hand which moves the wooden - headed pawn Wedgwood, hardly a man, certainly no Mason, and of what freedom and good report his prese nt intrigue is the best evidence.

Let us elect Lord Alfred Douglas S.G.M.G., and replace the name of Grand Architect of the Universe by that of Oscar Wilde! That would at least be honest, if not clean.

The plaintiff had at the time very great r espect and veneration for the defendant, whom he regarded as his spiritual preceptress and whom he credited with more than human attributes, and he agreed to serve her as the Assistant Correspondence Secretary with - out receiving from her any remuneratio n whatever. The plaintiff accordingly took up his abode at Adyar along with his second and third sons, J. Krishnamurti and J. Nityananda, who are respectively aged 17 and 14 . The boys were receiving their education in the Penathoor Subramanyam High Schoo l at Mylapore, Madras. But as Mr. R. B. Clarke and Mr. C. W. Leadbeater of the Theosophical Society undertook their education, and as the boys were not making much progress in their studies, the plaintiff stopped them from school and put them under thei r charge at Adyar. In or about December 1909 the defendant, who is frequently on tour in connection with her theosophical work, returned to India and promised to help undertake the future education of the boys. Accordingly the plaintiff stopped the boys f rom school altogether and kept them with himself at Adyar. 4 . About the beginning of 1910 the defendant requested the plaintiff to give a letter constituting her the guardian of the boys; and after some persuasion both on the part of the defendant and Sir S. Subramania Iyer, for whom the plaintiff had great respect, the plaintiff gave such letter, especially as the defendant had assured the plaintiff that the only reason for asking the letter was that after the plaintiff's lifetime his relations might give trouble to the"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"IN MEMORIAM — JOHN YARKER xxxiii defendant but for such a letter. The boys, however, continued to live with the plaintiff. 5 . In or about the later part of March 1910 the plaintiff discovered that his son J. Krishnamurti was being led into improper habits by C. W. Leadbeater, who held a very high position in the Theosophical Society; and on one occasion the plaintiff himself saw Leadbeater com - mitting an unnatural offence with the first minor. A few days after, the plaintiff strongly remonstrated with Mr. Leadbe ater, and made preparations for leaving Adyar with his sons, but on the persuasion of Sir Subramania Iyer, the Vice - President of the Theosophical Society, to stay on until the return of the defendant, who was then on tour, and in deference to the request of the defendant by wire, the plaintiff did not carry out his intentions. On her return, the plaintiff complained to the defendant about the conduct of Leadbeater, and she promised to keep the boys away from him, and immediately ordered the shifting of t heir bathrooms and residential rooms from the down - floor to the first - floor; and later on, when C. W. Leadbeater shifted his own room upstairs, the defendant arranged to take away the boys to Benares, and assured the plaintiff that they would have nothin g to do with Leadbeater. In spite of this, they were again being allowed to associate with the said Leadbeater, and it was about this time that he heard from other Theoso - phist friends that one Luxman, a personal attendant, had seen C. W. Leadbeater an d J. Krishnamurti in the defend - ant's room engaged in committing an unnatural offence. On a further remonstrance by the plaintiff, the defendant promised to take the boys away to England, and accordingly"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX xxxiv she left India for England about the end of March 1911 and returned to India only in the beginning of October 1911 , during which time, so far as the plaintiff was aware, the boys were kept away from associating with the said Mr. Leadbeater. 6 . In or about November 1911 the defendant told the plaintiff th at the boys were making rapid spiritual progress and were approaching initiation by the Masters (a set of superhuman gurus living on the eastern slopes of the Himalayas) believed in by the Theosophists. She therefore proposed to keep the boys with Mr. Le adbeater at Ootaca - mund preparatory to their initiation. On the plaintiff's objection the boys were not sent to Ootacamund. The plaintiff met the defendant in Benares in December 1911 and insisted on an absolute separation of the boys from Mr. Leadbeat er. But for the first time, to the plaintiff's great surprise, the defendant refused to adopt any such course, and alleged that the boys and Leadbeater had lived together for several lives past, and the Leadbeater was an Arhat or Saint, “who is on the ve rge of divinity.” The plaintiff stated that he could not accept any such position, and that unless the separation took place he would take action in the matter. 7 . The plaintiff returned from Benares to Adyar, and there, on or about January 19 , 1912 , th e defendant, in presence of certain members of the Theosophical Society, sent for the plaintiff and asked him what he wanted to be done in respect of the boys. The plaintiff only demanded that there should be absolute separation from the said Leadbeater . She agreed to this, and asked the plaintiff whether he had any objection to the boys being taken to England. The plaintiff assented,"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"IN MEMORIAM — JOHN YARKER xxxv as the defendant had alleged that she would be returning to India in April or May. In spite of her undertaking to k eep the boys separated from Leadbeater, the plaintiff has reason to believe that after reaching England she took the boys to Leadbeater in Italy and stayed with him for some weeks, thus breaking her promises. The plaintiff submits that, having regard to t he filthy and unnatural habits, character and antecedents of the said Leadbeater, it is extremely undesirable that the boys should be allowed to associate with him, or that he should be allowed to have access to them. 8 . The defendant started for England about February 1912 , but before she started she endeavoured to obtain evidence that Leadbeater was not guilty of the act complained of, and had a statement from her attendant, Luxman, recorded to that effect, and sent a copy of the same to the plaintiff. The plaintiff, on perusing this, wrote two letters to the defendant on the 7 th and 15 th of February 1912 , pointing out that even according to the statement aforesaid it was clear that Mr. Leadbeater was seen half dressed in her room with Krishna - murti. B efore these letters reached the defendant she wrote a letter to the plaintiff on February 7 , 1912 , from on board steamer, in which for the first time she set up that plaintiff has been ill - treating and starving his children. The plaintiff submits that thi s is an impudent and malicious lie trumped up by the defendant in view to further legal proceedings, and would be seen from the fact that the plaintiff was all along one of the trusted members of the Theosophical society and the Assistant Correspondence Secretary of the Esoteric Section thereof, and was paying for the mess of the boys wherever they were until November 1911 . The defendant in that letter also threatened that she would keep the boys in"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX xxxvi England until they attained their majority. The def endant also wanted the plaintiff to remove from Adyar, which he has accordingly done. The defendant has now returned to India, and has purposely refrained from bringing the boys with her to India in order to hamper the plaintiff in his efforts to recover the boys. 9 . The plaintiff states that all along the defendant has been aware of the practices of Leadbeater, and that after she reached England she took the boys again to Mr. Leadbeater in Italy. The plaintiff submits that the conduct of the defen - dan t as aforesaid renders her totally unfit to be in charge of the boys. The plaintiff further submits that the defendant has been stating that the first boy, who is named Alcyone, is, or is going to be, the Lord Christ, and sometimes that he is Lord Mait reya, and she has induced a number of persons to believe in this theory, with the result that the boy is deified, and that a number of respectable persons prostrate before him and show other signs of worship. It is also given out that the elder boy wrot e a book called At the Feet of the Master , which the plaintiff has reasons to believe to be a compilation made by Leadbeater. In any case, the boy who is not able to write a decent English letter is absolutely incapable of producing such a work. The pl aintiff submits that this course of conduct is calculated to warp the moral nature of the boys and to make them moral degenerates. The defendant, beyond putting forward divine claims on behalf of the boys, has not been taking proper care of their educat ion. The first boy has not picked up the rudiments of the English language in spite of three years of alleged tuition by English tutors. The plaintiff submits that he,"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"IN MEMORIAM — JOHN YARKER xxxvii as the father of the boys, is entitled to act as their guardian and is entitled to their custody, and further submits that the letter referred to in paragraph 4 cannot have the effect of de - priving him of the same; even assuming that it could, under the circumstances above detailed the defendant has proved herself totally unfit to be in charge of the boys, and the boys ought to be removed from her charge. When the said letter was given, the plaintiff believed the defendant to be superhuman and was completely under her influence and control, and he took her to be his preceptress who sho uld be obeyed implicitly and make any sacrifice demanded, and the contract, if any, made under such circumstances, is voidable on the ground of undue influence. In any case, if the defen - dant is unfit to be entrusted with the guardianship of the minors, the plaintiff's natural right as the guardian will again arise, inasmuch as the letter, if valid in law, was only a sur - render of the rights in favour of the defendant alone. The plaintiff's delay in taking action against the defendant has been due only to the faith which until recently he shared with many other persons that the defendant was semi - divine, and that the plaintiff was exceptionally fortunate in getting the defendant to take charge of the boys. The plaintiff was also led to believe that t he boy Krishnamurti was also possessed of divine attributes, and the plaintiff had to change his belief only on discovery of the circumstances connected with Leadbeater’s connection with the boys on the con - fession of the boy himself that the book At the Feet of the Master was not written by Krishnamurti, and on the dis - covery of the present imperfect state of their education. These circumstances came to light only during the latter part"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX xxxviii of 1912 , and it was only on receipt of the letter dated February 7 , 1912 , that the plaintiff realized fully how malicious and mendacious the defendant was and how totally unfit she was to be the guardian of the boys. 10 . The plaintiff submits that as the guardian of the boys he is entitled to their custody, and even otherwise, in the interest of the boys and their moral welfare, the defendant ought to be compelled to give them up to the plaintiff or to such other person as the Court may think fit. The plaintiff sent a notice on the 11 th July demanding that the boys should be brought back to India and replaced under the guardianship and custody of the plaintiff. The plaintiff submits that he had no authority and could not have dele - gated his parental rights to the defendant. Even assuming, however, that he could do so he was at liberty to revoke it at any time, especially with a view to promote the moral welfare of the boys, and that after the receipt of the said letter the defendant had no authority to keep the boys with herself. In answer to the plaintiff's not ice the defendant merely acknow - ledged its receipt and did nothing more, and the plaintiff believes that she has left the boys in England. 11 . The cause of the action arose partly at Adyar in the years 1910, 1911 and 1912 , when the plaintiff discovered the various matters referred to above in relation to the bring - ing up of the boys, and lastly on or about July 11 , 1912 , when the plaintiff sent a registered notice demanding delivery of the minors. 12 .

The author was not acquainted at that time with the literature of those gnostics who were the earliest and only true Christians. In Fragmen ts of a Faith Forgotten , however, we find the following passage: “After the banquet they keep the holy all - night festival. And this is how it is kept. They all stand up in a body, and about the middle of the entertainment they first of all separate into two bands, men in one and women in the other. And a leader is chosen for each, the conductor whose reputation is greatest and the one most suitable for the post. They then chant hymns made in God's honour in many metres and melodies, sometimes singing in chorus, sometimes one band beating time to the answering chant of the other, (now) dancing to its music,"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 6 (now) inspiring it, at one time in processional hymns, at another in standing songs, turning and re - turning in the dance. “Then when each band has feasted (that is, has sung and danced) apart by itself, drinking of God - pleasing (nectar), just as in the Bacchic rites men drink the wine unmixed, then they join together, and one chorus is formed of the two bands, in imitation of the joined chorus on the banks of the Red Sea, because of the wonderful works that had been there wrought. For the sea at God's command became for one party a cause of safety and for the other a cause of ruin. [Philo here refers to the fabled dance of triumph of the Israelites a t the destruction of Pharaoh and his host, when Moses led the men and Miriam the women in a common dance; but the Therapeuts all over the world could not have traced the custom to this myth.] “So the chorus of men and women Therapeuts, being formed as clo sely as possible on this model, by means of melodies in parts and harmony — the high notes of the women answering to the deep tones of the men — produces a harmonious and most musical symphony. The ideas are of the most beautiful, the expressions of the most beautiful, and the dancers reverent; while the goal of the ideas, expressions, and dances is piety. “Thus drunken unto morning's light with this fair drunkenness, with no head - heaviness or drowsiness, but with eyes and body fresher even than then they ca me to the banquet, they take their stand at dawn, when, catch - ing sight of the rising sun, they raise their hands to"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"EDITORIAL 7 heaven, praying for sunlight and truth and keenness of spiritual vision.

L et the Practicus study the textbooks of astronomy, travel, if need be, to a land where the sun and stars are visible, and observe the heavens with the best telescopes to which he may have access. Let him commit to memory the principal fact, and (at least roughly) the figures of the science. 1. Now, since these figures will leave no direct impression with any precision upon his mind, let him adopt this practice A. A. Let the Practicus be seated before a bare square table, and let an unknown number of small sim ilar objects be thrown by his chela from time to time upon the table, and by that chela be hastily gathered up. Let the Practicus declare at the glance, and the chela confirm by his count, the number of such objects. The practice should be for a quarter of an hour thrice daily. The maximum number of objects should at first be seven. This maximum should increase by one at each practice, provided that not a single mistake is made by the Practicus in appreciating the number thrown."},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":" 38 This practice should conti nue assiduously for at least one year. The quickness of the chela in gathering up the objects is expected to increase with time. The practice need not be limited to a quarter of an hour thrice daily after a time, but increased with discretion. Care must be taken to detect the first symptom of fatigue, and to stop, if possible, even before it threatens. The practised psychologist learned to recognise even minute hesitations that mark the forcing of the attention. 2. Alternating with the above, let the Practi cus begin this practice B. It is assumed that he has thoroughly conquered the elementary difficulties of Dharana , and is able to prevent mental pictures from altering shape, size and colour against his will. B. Seated in the open air, let him endeavour to form a complete mental picture of himself and his immediate surroundings. It is important that he should be the centre of such picture, and able to look freely in all directions. The finished picture should be a complete consciousness of the whole, fixe d, clear, and definite. Let him gradually add to this picture by including objects more and more distant, until he have an image of the whole field of vision. He will probably discover that it is very difficult to increase the apparent size of the picture as he proceeds, and it should be his most earnest endeavour to do so. He should seek in particular to appreciate distances, almost to the point of combating the laws of perspective."},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"LINES TO A YOUNG LADY VIOLINIST 39 3.

Let him add the Moon, keeping well in mind the relative sizes of, and the distance between, the planet and its satellite. He will probably find the final trick of mind to be a constant disappearance of the image, and the appearance of the same upon a smaller scale . This trick he must outwit by constancy of endeavour. He will then add in turn Venus, Mars, Mercury and the Sun. It is permissible at this stage to change the point of view to the centre of the Sun, and to do so may add stability to the conception. The P racticus may then add the Asteroids, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune. The utmost attention to detail is now necessary, as the picture is highly com - plex, apart from the difficulty of appreciating relative size and distance.

First (Ma rch 21 ), the conscious personal work of his life was crystallized in the thorough establishment of his system of Scientific Illuminism or Sceptical Theurgy through the publication of Number I of the Equinox; Second (October 17 ), he accomplished his purely human duty without which he had no right to become Sannyasin; Third (April), another purely human side of his life reached a proper climax; Fourth (December), he was relieved of his last human responsibility; Fifth (June), he was brought back completely, in full freedom, into the work laid down in Liber Legis . All these things were doubtless necessary as a winding - up of his business with Earth. The result is the final Initiation of December 3 . There is a very curious entry in his diary for January 1 — “ Having left the Juggler (Standard Music - hall), ate 12 oysters = 1 crab = Abrahadabra, a small bottle of No. 111 (cost 231 pence), invoked and banished Mercury in P. Circus, opened message from Adonai. Folly = Aleph.”"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 96 This was the way in which he would d ivine the forthcoming year. He did various things of a quite ordinary nature with an intense magical intention. He had asked a disciple to write him a message to be opened at midnight. The disciple, being a fool, wrote a foolish message, but none the le ss inspired. The diary continues thus — “Sought accidental symbols while looking for a black woman to represent Binah” (to which he was aspiring). “Entered by chance, firstly, Queen's Hotel [can this refer to Binah?] and Leicester.” (Leicester was the tow n whose hospitality had temporarily relieved him of his thorn in the flesh. Permanent relief followed in the course of the year.) He did not see any black woman, but a woman came to him and asked for alms, telling her sad story — which was that she had b een a servant who was now a fertilized free - woman with a young male child. He took this as a symbol of Binah in her form of Aima, the Rejoicing Mother. Further, she was dressed in grey, the colour of Chokmah, which he took to imply that she was the righ t kind of Mother, being covered by the Father. There is no record of any importance in the diary until the Vernal Equinox, when the “Word of the Equinox,” which is given out by the Masters to govern the events of the six months, was Perdurabo; and we fin d, in fact, that during this six months were some of the most important events of our history, whose which finished Perdurabo. On June 15 , he was at his Sacred House, and there con - ferred the Initiation of Neophyte upon his first probationer. The event of June 28 is so important that a little pre -"},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"THE TEMPLE OF SOLOMON THE KING 97 liminary explanation is required. It has been explained with what reluctance he moved to the obtaining of Liber Legis . We have seen how he tried to avoid carrying out the instructions; how he tried to give up M agick altogether; how he tried to take up Buddhism; how he tried any and every Path to escape the task laid upon him. He even attempted to publish Liber Legis and the 30 th and 29 th Æthyrs which he had obtained in Mexico, with sceptical commentary. We fi nd him driven inch by inch into the Path appointed by the Masters. We have seen him stripped of all that he had and of all that he was. We know, too, that he made the obtaining of Samadhi a condition of his taking up the work, on the ground that no one without that experience could possibly carry it out, and we have seen this demand granted. We have seen him hailed by the Adepts of the Great White Brotherhood in England, as not only one of themselves, but as their Master, nay, as the Logos of the Æon. We have seen him refuse to admit it. Ultimately, when every obstacle had been cleared away, when the Adepts themselves urged him to take up the work, his will refused assent, and that with finality. “For,” said he, “it is impossible. In my copy of the Book of the Law I find it written ‘This book shall be trans - lated into all tongues, but always with the original in the writing of the Beast, for in the chance shape of the letters and their positions to one another, in these are mysteries that no Beast sh all divine,’ and this original has been lost. I have not seen it for five years.” With this he dismissed the matter from his mind. He would continue with scientific illuminism. He would publish various scholarly studies of such works as Dr. Dee’s. Wha t"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 98 he would not do was — what he was told! It was impossible, and there was an end of the matter. However, he was obliged to go to his house in Scotland on business, and he arrived there on June 15 . Two days later he was joined by two disciples. One of these was interested in mountaineering, and had asked him for a pair of his ski. Several pairs were discovered in the loft. Some days later he determined to look for four large canvases, on which, nine years earlier, he had painted in their proper colou rs the Four Watch Towers of the universe given by Dr. Dee. The house was ransacked by the three men and by the servants; no trace was discovered, and the search was abandoned. On June 28 , we find this entry — “ Glory be to Nuit, Hadit, Ra - Hoor - Khuit in the Highest! A little before midday I was impelled mysteriously (though exhausted by playing fives, billiards, etc. till nearly six this morning), to make a final search for Elemental Tablets. And lo! when I had at last abandoned the search, I cast mine eyes upon a hole in the loft, where were ski, etc., and there, O Holy, Holy, Holy! were not only all that I sought, but the manuscript of Liber Legis! ” It was the last straw. For the next two days he remained in meditation, as in his previous Samm a Sati meditation in Burma and China, where his marvellous escape from death supplied the last factor in the equation, and brought him to the understanding of who he was and what his work. So"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"THE TEMPLE OF SOLOMON THE KING 99 this strange finding robbed him of his last excuse for not ta king up the work. Here was the reason for the years spent by him in climbing mountains. Because he had climbed mountains he desired ski; because he had climbed mountains he had gone to Cumberland in the winter previous, and there found the disciple K. M. W., whose request for the ski had brought him to the loft. Here, too, was the reason of his life - tragedy, for without that he would not have gone to Cumberland at that time or gone to his house in Scotland that summer. There was no further escape. He must take up the terrible Karma, which he had evaded, in spite of the tremendous pressure brought to bear upon him by the Masters, for five years. It is Their silent dealings with him which fill Volume 0 of the Equinox . Broken at last, he went to the top most point of the hill which crowns his estate, at midnight, and there, as we read in the diary, “I once more solemnly renounced all that I have or am. On departing, instantly shone the moon, two days before her fullness, over the hill among the clouds. ” A pencil note in the diary, written much later, underlines the words “two days before her fullness,” and notes: “And I attained two quarters of year later approximately.” The traces of this decision are now apparent when, from August 22 to 25 , we find h im at Maidenhead writing Aha! In this poem he gives a complete account of all that had occurred to him. Beginning with some hint of the aspiration to the Knowledge and Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel, it continues with an account of the method of meditation, culminating in that same Knowledge and Conversation.

But to return to the effect upon Fra. P. of the Finding of the Lost Book. There is no longer any hesitation or dissipation; as an Arrow from the Bow he flies to the mark of his high calling. We now find him, therefore, attempting to carry out the work, and finding it as difficult to do so as he had previously found it to avoid doing so; yet doing so successfully, since he was working in accordance with the Will of the Masters, and this Temple of Solomon the King was now intended t o lead up to the point which it has at last attained."},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"THE TEMPLE OF SOLOMON THE KING 113 However, this account in The Temple of Solomon the King is too clumsy, too overloaded with matter irrelevant to the main purpose, to serve as the book referred to in Liber Legis III . 39 . It will form a book of reference for students, but not a popular treatise. Frater Perdurabo was conscious of this difficulty. A further revelation through another messenger was necessary before the matter could be brought to a satisfactory conclusion. It is unnec essary in this place to detail how this came about, as it is quite recent and of too great importance in itself to deal with in any casual manner. It must suffice that this instruction is now being fully obeyed, as will be evident upon the publication of Part IV of Book 4 . We now return to the diary. On September 24 we find a new password for the forthcoming Equinox — Audio . Its sublime meaning was not yet suspected by Frater Perdurabo. On November 9 we find the entry “Here endeth this diary, for I writ e now in a Holy Book of my Holy Pilgrimage to the Sun.” In fact, he left London for Paris on November 10 , attended only by a single Chela. He arrived at Algiers on the 17 th, and on the next day took the tram to Arba, from which point they started to wa lk to Bou - Saada. At Aumale he took up again the work of obtaining the Cries of the 30 Æthyrs, to which he had not paid attention since August 1900 . It is evident that he was stopped from going beyond that point at that time. A study of these Cries will ex plain to students of intelli - gence the details of this Initiation, and it will be seen from the remarks at the end of the 13 th Æthyr that it is not possible to proceed beyond the 16 th for any one who is not a Master of the Temple. In the 19 th Æthyr is the beginning of this"},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 114 Initiation, and it will be noticed that even in the 22 nd Æthyr the Samahdi of Atmadarshana occurs, while in the 21 st Æthyr is the vision of Kether, and in the 20 th Shivadarshana, although not perfect. In the 19 th, then, the Angel of Init iation appears, and in the 18 th Shivadarshana, in its new and higher form — “Shiva” being replaced by “Horus” — takes place. In the 17 th the Initiation continues. The Angel took him into the Pylon of the threshold in the 19 th. In the 17 th he is balanced. I n the 16 th is the first dim dawn of the Great Ones of Liber Legis as Lords of the Initiation, and something of the nature of the ceremony is foreshadowed. In the 15 th the Adept is examined, and permission is given to pass him fully to the grade of Magist er Templi, but admission to any further grade refused. It will be noticed, further, that this all takes place in a Temple of the Rosy Cross. In the 14 th Æthyr we get the initiation itself. Fra. P. and his Chela, who was acting as his scribe, were upon D a’leh Addin, a mountain in the desert a few miles from Bou - Saada. It was found impossible to reach that Æthyr, and the Angel said, “Depart, for thou must invoke me only in the darkness, for the mystery cannot be spoken in sight of the sun.” Frater Per durabo therefore withdrew from the Vision. It was then that a strange thing happened. Impelled by some instinct or inspiration, it came to them that they must then and there build a Temple to the Most Holy Exalted One, and in this Temple invoke Him. The top of the mountain was covered with large loose stones entirely suitable for this purpose. In the course of an hour or so it was built,"},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"THE TEMPLE OF SOLOMON THE KING 115 and the invocation made, after which an inscription recording the result was built. This invocation was of a very rema rkable character. There had been a bar to the progress of Frater Perdurabo, a dualism in his conception of the Cosmos. He had not fully understood that the Universe was One, that one might in very truth eat and drink to the glory of God. He knew that by eating and drinking one did not necessarily detract from the glory of God, but had not fully understood the sacra - mentalism of the simplest actions. Now he knew that the huddling together of unhewn stones might build a better Temple than that of Luxor or of Karnak. He had still the old illusion that to succeed on one plane you must fail on another; still thought the mind more than the body, the soul more than the mind; did not see that these three must be one in exactly the same sense as the Christia n Trinity (as under - stood by the truest Christians) is One. It was in the course of this illumination that the Truth was ceremonially conveyed to him on the Magical plane, although it was not for three years later that it fully illuminated his mind. This illusion, of which it is here spoken, is a most necessary step for the beginner, because to the beginner his ordinary life is not a sacrament. To him things are really common and unclean. He must, therefore, cut them out of his life, and hence to him th e name of the Path is Renun - ciation. But to him who would be a Master of the Temple, the reverse applies. He wishes to remain perpetually in Samadhi, and it is therefore his renunciation to descend further and further into matter. He has volatilized th e fixed: now he must fix the volatile. He has ascended from his par - ticular body to the Universal Soul. That Universal Soul"},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 116 must now incarnate itself ever more completely in that body, and in the bodies and minds of all men. He has made his darkness li ght; that light must illuminate the darkness of all. Having then received this last Initiation, this destruction of the opposition, between One and the Many, he descended from the mountain, and awaited nightfall. The nature of the Initiation itself — its cli max and comple - tion — can only be given in the sublime words of the Angel of the Æthyr itself. We therefore quote it in full — The Angel reappears. The blackness gathers about, so thick, so clinging, so penetrating, so oppressive, that all the other darknes s that I have ever conceived would be like bright light beside it. His voice comes in a whisper: O thou that art master of the fifty gates of Understanding, is not my mother a black woman? O thou that art master of the Pentagram, is not the egg of spirit a black egg? Here abideth terror, and the blind ache of the Soul, and lo! even I, who am the sole light, a spark shut up, stand in the sign of Apophis and Typhon. I am the snake that devoureth the spirit of man with the lust of light. I am the sightless storm in the night that wrappeth the world about with desolation. Chaos is my name, and thick darkness. Know thou that the darkness of the earth is ruddy, and the darkness of the air is grey, but the darkness of the soul is utter blackness.

Thinkest thou that there is life within the Masters of the Temple, that sit hooded, encamped upon the Sea? Verily, there is no life in them. Their sandals were the pure light, and they have taken them from their feet and cast them down through the abyss, for this Æthyr is holy ground. Herein no forms appear, and the vision of God face to face, that is transmuted in the Athanor called dissolution, or hammered into one in the forge of meditation, is in this place but a blasphemy and a mockery.

In all previous grades the nature of the Initiation has been light through darkness. In this it is dark ness through light. The word of the Adept was L V X, Light. The word of the Master of the Temple is N O X, Night. This is the Night of Pan. The direction of the Path is definitely changed. The Master of the Temple cannot go to the Magus unless bringi ng the Neophyte himself in his hand, and in this task there is no consolation, as there has always been before. The visions are no more. Silence and stillness and darkness rule the grade. The Adept has through - out his progress been unifying himself. As it is written in Liber CCCXXXIII , Chapter III, the Brothers of A ∴ A ∴ are women; the Aspirants to A ∴ A ∴ are men. The Master of the Temple has given birth to a child, which child appears as an Adept among men. But that which was the Adept is but a littl e pile of dust. Samadhi has been attained once and for all. The process is complete and permanent. The Great Work is accomplished. The new Great Work is pro - claimed. He has finished with Solve. He must begin Coagula. In the 13 th Æthyr the Initiation c ontinues. The Initiate obtains his reward, and that reward is to understand all, yet to labour in the darkness without hope of reward. Now, however, we come to the 12 th Æthyr, wherein is the second mystery of the Reward, of which the key is the word N O X. BABALON, the Lady of the City of the Pyramids, is revealed. In Liber VII is the first utterance of the Master of the Temple, and this book should be studied by those who seek a further understanding."},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"THE TEMPLE OF SOLOMON THE KING 121 Such is the first part of the Ritual of Initiation. I n the second part the Master is made to understand what is that Abyss which he has passed. In the 11 th AEthyr he comes to the fortress upon the frontier of the Abyss, and is there prepared for the crossing of the Abyss. Every drop of his blood is taken fo r the cup of BABALON. The Candidate asks, “Is there not the Holy Guardian Angel?” And the answer is given, “My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?” It is the last word of the Æthyr. And of all the horror of the Abyss, that is the one word that ye t chills his blood as he remembers it. Now then, in the 10 th AEthyr, is given the Abyss. The Candidate is identified with the horror of that Abyss. Had not the Master already passed the Abyss, as it were, un - officially, he could not have endured this c rystallization of it into name and form. In the 9 th AEthyr comes a further reward, a further under - standing of the task. And the first indication that he has really passed the Abyss on all planes is that there is no longer any curse. All is blessing. There is a secret meaning, a blessing in everything. And this is his reward — the Daughter of BABALON the beautiful. She is the pure soul, glorified by virtue of his attainment. In the 8 th Æthyr this is continued. The Master becomes a Holy Guardian Ange l unto another, the Bridegroom of his Bride. This marriage is now accomplished in the 7 th Æthyr. There is Samadhi, but now no longer from below, but from above."},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 122 The reward of Understanding is further granted in the remaining Æthyrs. In the 6 th there is a shadowing forth of the Grade of Magus. And with this closes this part of the Initiation. Now then, in the 5 th Æthyr, comes the final reception. And after this reception among the Brothers of the Silver Star comes the Vision of the Arrow. In the 4 th Æth yr, the nature of the Great Work which the Master of the Temple must accomplish is shown more fully. The Holy Guardian Angel presents his Bride to the Mother, who presents her to the Father. One may remark that it is necessary to be a Master of the Templ e before anything like a full understanding of these mysteries can be attained. In the 3rd Æthyr the Guards to the further Grades are exhibited. Now it may be asked, “What has become of the blood of the Adept which was put into the cup of BABALON, for tha t blood is his life?” In this supreme Initiation narrated in the 2 nd Æthyr the answer to this question is given. The word “Samadhi” is now deep down, “an old unhappy far - off thing.” By so much does this exceed that. In this supreme marriage of Infinit e with Infinite comes the key to the Grade of Ipsissimus, which Grade is shadowed forth — but oh, how dimly! — in the 1 st Æthyr. It will be noticed by those who understand this Æthyr that when all is done there is a complete identification (on the very last p age) of that highest thing with that lowest. The Master of the Temple is not only the dust in the Pyramid, and the Blood in the Cup, but he is also that which was cast down through the Abyss into the Heaven of Jupiter. The"},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"THE TEMPLE OF SOLOMON THE KING 123 brain reels before such a conc eption. And the human brain of the Master of the Temple is but little more fitted to under - stand this in his life as a man than if he had never entered on the Path at all. For the Ego has been totally destroyed, and he has nothing wherewith to bind tog ether these things. He is not any of these things, for there is no He. Those things are. And of the results of this, and of how it may bear upon the question of his advancement to the Grade of Magus, who can say? It is not the Master of the Temple eve n who could answer such a question. For, in relation to his advancement, he is but that little pile of dust which is to burn up, and from which shall be prepared a white ash by Hermes the Invisible. And in relation to his true life, it is mixed with the blood of all his fellows in the Cup of BABALON. And in relation to his body and mind he is but a vehicle of the forces that are beyond the Abyss. He will therefore speak, but as a man among men, of that which he has seen and heard. But he will not cla im authority. He will not proclaim dogma. For all that in him from which such things proceed is no more. He will remain in the darkness of the City of the Pyramids under the Night of Pan, sitting silent through 106 seasons, the name of every one of w hich is Death, ever seeking to make his understanding perfect, until the time comes for him to seek that yet more fearful ordeal which must evidently 1 be involved in the attainment of the Grade of Magus. That such a time should arrive in this present life would probably seem to him unthinkable. One would imagine that the Magus must be born, not made.

One would imagine that in order to be suitable for such Initiation, the body and mind must be completely representative of the whole of the Cosmos, a perfect microcosm. The Mind of such an one must perfect ly comprehend every phase of the Universe without exception. It must, in the most real intellectual sense, be equally “The buffet and the Ear.” As it is written, “A man of like passions as we are.” It is not possible here or elsewhere, nor is it particul arly desirable, to enlarge upon such a subject. Such discussions are as unprofitable as those sterile controversies about the nature of Nirvana, that have done more harm to Oriental thought than all the rest of it has done good. For that which is requisit e for every man is the next step , and Frater P. has concentrated his message into this one phrase, “ATTAIN TO THE KNOWLEDGE AND CONVERSATION OF THE HOLY GUARDIAN ANGEL.” All beyond that is useless till that has been done. Here, then, the task of the wr iters of this book. The Temple of Solomon the King , may end. The progress of a man has been described in detail with the documents reproduced verbatim.

The beloved disciple, full of age and saintliness, is gone to his reward. The story of his life has already b een told, though, alas! inadequately, in the Equinox and in Who’s Who , but no list of his achievements is given even in What’s What , or What Swat , as we used affectionately to call our premier book of reference. The Witches’ Switch has only a passing all usion. The career of Arthur Edward Waite was largely de - termined by his father's fine perception. 1 “Ned, my lad,” said he when the future saint was barely six years of age, “brains are not your long suit, I can see. But it doesn't matter. If you can't be wise, look wise!” These words sank deeply into the mind of the future saint, and only two days later, when his father handed him a work on the Integral Calculus, he looked through it in a steady professional manner, going backwards and forwards severa l times, knitting his brows, nodding his head and muttering, “H’m! ingenious,” [ 1 Also, of course, by Karma. — Ed.]"},{"pageNumber":258,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 212 now and again. He then closed the volume with a snap, and said in a tone of infinite finality: “Inferentially inadequate data machicholated cerebrothoracically.” “By jingo!” re plied his father, “but you’re IT!” In this position there was only one weak point. There are people who understand the Integral Calculus, and there are people capable of disentangling words and sentences. Or rather, at that time, that was so. The art o f darkening counsel was in its infancy. The future saint was predestined to change all that. Arthur were wise, therefore, to find, if possible, a science so abstruse and venerable that no one at all understood it, and whose most respected authors wrote i n an indecipherable cryptogram. Such a science was found for little Arthur (the future saint!) in Alchemy. To establish a reputation was the work of a moment. To be “editor” of Paracelsus, Trithemius, Flamel, Eugenius Philalethes, Ripley, Starkey, Sendiv ogius, Basil Valentine, and a dozen others is a splendid position in the world of humane letters. To achieve this: obtain copies of their works, and forward carriage paid to a printer, with the remark — worthy of Julius Caesar at his tersest — ‘Reprint!’ Wou ld God it had stopped there! But (remember!) the future saint wasn't wise, he was only “looking wise,” and he made a terrible mistake by accepting a few shillings — all to0 few! — to whitewash Dr. Wynn Westcott (and English Free - masons generally) in the Diana Vaughan affair.

Relentlessly does he demolish his adversary. If Camden is spent Campden (which might happen to the best of French authors) he shrieks [ sic! ! ! ]. Many other remarks of the future saint display a lack of any sense of proportion or humour which was deplorable, and, by his best friends, deplored. It was also unfortunate in a way that a book purporting to deal exhaustively with the inmost cabinet secrets of high - grade Freemasonry should be written by one who was not even a craft Mason. The 2 result was that Dr. Wynn Westcott having been made to swear by all his gods that he was not Consulting Chemist to the British Government Underground Secret Poison Factory at Gibraltar, and that he had never received at his house a lady whom everybody but himself and the future saint (for in the whirligigs and revenges and, so to speak, Cochons Volants of time such was to be!) knew to be the absinthe or galette - begotten image in the mind of a French fumiste who had never in his brightest hours hoped to be taken seriously by as much as a rag - picker — people began to wonder what was the truth beneath the stori es which Westcott was at such pains to deny. 1 Waite quotes the commonest name in all South India as if it were some - thing too fantastic for belief. 2 Please make paragraph read clearly. — Printer’s Reader.

The future saint (far indeed from saintship at this time — but the ways of Providence are indeed wondrous!) knew that there was an inner order, but had no idea of its name; he only no ticed that he was not invited to enter it. So, to pass the time, he wrote his Real History of the Rosicrucians , in which he proved conclusively that there were no Rosicrucians and never had been, and that if any moderns claimed to be Rosicrucians there was “that difference between their asser - tion and the facts of the case in which the essence of a lie consists.” No sooner had he published these remarks (amid general applause) than it was gently broken to the future saint that the liars he had been deno uncing were his own occult chiefs, of whom he had been writing (elsewhere) in language which out - Mahatmaed the most eloquent - mysterious Theosophists, and left the sectaries of the Saviour high and dry.

Still more so Crowley's habitual recitation from Blake — “ Steiger, Steiger, burning bright In the forests of the night, What immortal hand and eye Framed thy fearful syntaxy?” And he positively hated to be call “pot of basil,” or even “Columbus.” He also disliked puns on his name and allusions to his personal appearance — his close resemblance to the excellent foreman printer at the Ballantyne Press was a constant source of irritation — also to his style of dress, which proven in -"},{"pageNumber":265,"pageContent":"DEAD WEIGHT 219 eradicable; and he used to wince when h is familiars called him “Art,” as it revived the story of Crowley's epigram on his work, as Art for Art’s Sake .

To the end he combined an intensity of holy awe with a kind of timid audacity of reverential love for the Master, to which the latter responded with the most gracious condescension, mingled with that peculiar affection which one feels for an old and worthless dog belonging to somebody else. It was an unique and altogether idyllic relation. His motto, “Fides, spes, caritas sunt virtutes ab omnibus Christianis diligendae” had to be shortened for convenience' s ake to “Fides,” or, more usually, “Fido”; and it was excessively touching to hear the caressing austerity of the tones of the Master when he had occasion to address him.

It may be regarded as written by him as his Thesis for the Grade of Exempt Adept, just as his Ritual and Dogma was his Thesis for the grade of a Major Adept. He is, in fact, no longer talking of things as if their s ense was fixed and universal. He is beginning to see some - thing of the contradiction inherent in the nature of things, or at any rate, he constantly illustrates the fact that the planes are to be kept separate for practical purposes, although in the final analysis they turn out to be one. This, and the extra - ordinarily subtle and delicate irony of which Eliphas Levi is one of the greatest masters that has ever lived, have baffled the pedantry and stupidity of such commentators as Waite. English has hardl y a word to express the mental condition of such unfortunates. Dummheit , in its strongest German sense, is about the nearest thing to it. It is as if a geographer should criticize Gulliver's Travels from his own particular standpoint. When Levi says th at all that he asserts as an initiate is subordinate to his humble submissiveness as a Christian, and then not only remarks that the Bible and the Qur’án are different translations of the same book, but treats the Incarnation as an allegory, it is evident that a good deal of submission will be required.

His very defence of the Catholic Hierarchy is a masterpiece of that peculiar form of conscious sophistry which justifies itself by reducing its conclusion to zer o.

In the Pope we have such an authority ready made, and it is the grav est tactical blunder to endeavour to set up an authority opposed to him. Success in doing so means war, and failure anarchy. This, however, did not pre - vent Levi from ceremonially casting a papal crown to the ground and crying “Death to tyranny and supe rstition!” in the bosom of a certain secret Areopagus of which he was the most famous member. When a man becomes a magician he looks about him for a magical weapon; and, being probably endowed with that human frailty called laziness, he hopes to find a we apon ready made. Thus we find the Christian Magus who imposed his power upon the world taking the existing worships and making a single system combining all their merits.

It is necessary for the reader to gain this clear conc eption of Levi's inmost mind, if he is to reconcile the “contra - dictions” which leave Waite petulant and bewildered. It is the sad privilege of the higher order of mind to be able to see both sides of every question, and to appreciate the fact that both a re equally tenable.

It seems unnecessary to add anything to these few remarks. This is the only difficulty in the whole book, though in one or two passages Levi's extraordinarily keen sense of humour leads him to indulge in a little harmless bombast. We may instance his remarks on the Grimoire of Honorius. We have said that this is the masterpiece of Levi.

To under - stand this science, is to see God. The author of this book, as he finishes his work, will think that he has demonstrated it. Then, when you have seen God, the hierophant will say to you: — “Turn round!” and, in the shadow which you throw in the presence of this sun of intelligences, there will appear to you the devil, that black phantom which y ou see when your gaze is not fixed upon God, and when you think that your shadow fills the sky, — for the vapours of the earth, the higher they go, seem to magnify it more and more. To harmonize in the category of religion science with revelation and reason with faith, to demonstrate in philosophy the absolute principles which reconcile all the antinomies, and finally to reveal the universal equilibrium of natural forces, is the triple object of this work, which will consequently be divided into three parts."},{"pageNumber":283,"pageContent":"PREFACE xiii We shall exhibit true religion with such characters, that no one, believer or unbeliever, can fail to recognize it; that will be the absolute in religion. We shall establish in philosophy the immutable characters of that Truth, which is in science, real ity ; in judgment, reason ; and in ethics, justice . Finally, we shall acquaint you with the laws of Nature, whose equilibrium is stability, and we shall show how vain are the phantasies of our imagination before the fertile realities of movement and of lif e. We shall also invite the great poets of the future to create once more the divine comedy, no longer according to the dreams of man, but according to the mathematics of God. Mysteries of other worlds, hidden forces, strange revela - tions, mysterious illn esses, exceptional faculties, spirits, apparitions, magical paradoxes, hermetic arcana, we shall say all, and we shall explain all. Who has given us this power? We do not fear to reveal it to our readers. There exists an occult and sacred alphabet whic h the Hebrews attribute to Enoch, the Egyptians to Thoth or to Hermes Trismegistus, the Greeks to Cadmus and to Pala - medes. This alphabet was known to the followers of Pythagoras, and is composed of absolute ideas attached to signs and numbers; by its com binations, it realizes the mathematics of thought. Solomon represented this alphabet by seventy - two names, written upon thirty - six talismans. Eastern initiates still call these the “little keys” or clavicles of Solomon.

PRELIM INARY CONSIDERATIONS W HEN Count Joseph de Maistre, that grand and passion - ate lover of Logic, said despairingly, “The world is without religion,” he resembled those people who say rashly “There is no God.” The world, in truth, is without the religion of Co unt Joseph de Maistre, as it is probable that such a God as the majority of atheists conceive does not exist. Religion is an idea based upon one constant and universal"},{"pageNumber":288,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 2 fact; man is a religious animal. The word “religion” has then a necessary and absolute sense. Nature herself sanctifies the idea which this word represents, and exalts it to the height of a principle. The need of believing is closely linked with the need of loving; for that reason our souls need communion in the same hopes and in the sam e love. Isolated beliefs are only doubts: it is the bond of mutual confidence which, by creating faith, composes religion. Faith does not invent itself, does not impose itself, does not establish itself by any political agreement; like life, it manifests itself with a sort of fatality. The same power which directs the phenomena of nature, extends and limits the supernatural domain of faith, despite all human foresight. One does not imagine revelations; one undergoes then, and one believes in them. In vain does the spirit protest against the obscurities of dogma; it is subjugated by the attraction of these very obscurities, and often the least docile of reasoners would blush to accept the title of “irreligious man.” Religion holds a greater place among the realities of life than those who do without religion — or pretend to do without it — affect to believe. All ideas that raise man above the animal — moral love, devotion, honour — are sentiments essen - tially religious. The cult of the fatherland and of the fa mily, fidelity to an oath and to memory, are things which humanity will never abjure without degrading itself utterly, and which could never exist without the belief in something greater than mortal life, with all its vicissitudes, its ignorance and its misery. If annihilation were the result of all our aspirations to"},{"pageNumber":289,"pageContent":"THE KE Y OF THE MYSTERIES 3 those sublime things which we feel to be eternal, our only duties would be the enjoyment of the present, forgetfulness of the past, and carelessness about the future, and it would be rigoro usly true to say, as a celebrated sophist once said, that the man who thinks is a degraded animal. Moreover, of all human passions, religious passion is the most powerful and the most lively. It generates itself, whether by affirmation or negation, with a n equal fanaticism, some obstinately affirming the god that they have made in their own image, the others denying God with rashness, as if they had been able to understand and to lay waste by a single thought all that world of infinity which pertains to Hi s great name. Philosophers have not sufficiently considered the physio - logical fact of religion in humanity, for in truth religion exists apart from all dogmatic discussion. It is a faculty of the human soul just as much as intelligence and love. While man exists, so will religion. Considered in this light, it is nothing but the need of an infinite idealism, a need which justifies every aspiration for progress, which inspires every devotion, which alone prevents virtue and honour from being mere words, serving to exploit the vanity of the weak and the foolish to the profit of the strong and the clever. It is to this innate need of belief that one might justly give the name of natural religion; and all which tends to clip the wings of these beliefs is, on the religious plane, in opposi - tion to nature. The essence of the object of religion is mystery, since faith begins with the unknown, abandoning the rest to the investigations of science. Doubt is, moreover, the mortal enemy of faith; faith feels tha t the intervention of"},{"pageNumber":290,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 4 the divine being is necessary to fill the abyss which separates the finite from the infinite, and it affirms this intervention with all the warmth of its heart, with all the docility of its intelligence. If separated from this act of faith, the need of religion finds no satisfaction, and turns to scepticism and to despair. But in order that the act of faith should not be an act of folly, reason wishes it to be directed and ruled. By what? By science? We have seen that science can do nothing here. By the civil authority? It is absurd. Are our prayers to be superintended by policemen? There remains, then, moral authority, which alone is able to constitute dogma and establish the discipline of worship, in concert this time with t he civil authority, but not in obedience to its orders. It is necessary, in a word, that faith should give to the religious need a real satisfaction, — a satisfaction entire, permanent and indubitable. To obtain that, it is necessary to have the absolute a nd invariable affirmation of a dogma preserved by an authorized hierarchy. It is necessary to have an efficacious cult, giving, with an absolute faith, a substantial realization of the symbols of belief. Religion thus understood being the only one which can satisfy the natural need of religion, it must be the only really natural religion. We arrive, without help from others, at this double definition, that true natural religion is revealed religion. The true revealed religion is the hierarchical and tra ditional religion, which affirms itself absolutely, above human discussion, by communion in faith, hope, and charity. Representing the moral authority, and realizing it by the efficacy of its ministry, the priesthood is as holy and infallible as humanity i s subject to vice and to error. The priest,"},{"pageNumber":291,"pageContent":"THE KE Y OF THE MYSTERIES 5 qua priest, is always the representative of God. Of little account are the faults or even the crimes of man. When Alexander VI consecrated his bishops, it was not the poisoner who laid his hands upon them, it was the pope. Pope Alexander VI never corrupted or falsified the dogmas which condemned him, or the sacraments which in his hands saved others, and did not justify him. At all times and in all places there have been liars and criminals, but in the hier archical and divinely authorized Church there have never been, and there will never be, either bad popes or bad priests. “Bad” and “priest” form an oxymoron. We have mentioned Alexander VI, and we think that this name will be sufficient without other memo ries as justly execrated as his being brought up against us. Great criminals have been able to dishonour themselves doubly because of the sacred character with which they were invested, but they had not the power to dishonour that character, which remains always radiant and splendid above fallen humanity. 1 We have said that there is no religion without mysteries; let us add that there are no mysteries without symbols. The symbol, being the formula or the expression of the mystery, only expresses its unkno wn depth by paradoxical images borrowed from the known. The symbolic form, having for its object to characterize what is above scientific reason, should necessarily find itself without that reason: hence the celebrated and perfectly just remark of a Fathe r of the Church: “I believe because it is absurd. Credo quia absurdum .” If science were to affirm what it did not know, it would 1 A dog has six legs. Definition.

Science will then never be able to perform the work of faith, any more than faith can decide in a matter of s cience. An affirmation of faith with which science is rash enough to meddle can then be nothing but an absurdity for it, just as a scientific statement, if given us as an article of faith, would be an absurdity on the religious plane. To know and to beli eve are two terms which can never be confounded. It would be equally impossible to oppose the one to the other. It is impossible, in fact, to believe the contrary of what one knows without ceasing, for that very reason, to know it; and it is equally impos sible to achieve a knowledge contrary to what one believes without ceasing immediately to believe. To deny or even to contest the decisions of faith in the name of science is to prove that one understands neither science nor faith: in fine, the mystery of a God of three persons is not a problem of mathematics; the incarnation of the Word is not a phenomenon in obstetrics; the scheme of redemption stands apart from the criticism of the historian. Science is absolutely powerless to decide whether we are righ t or wrong in believing or disbelieving dogma; it can only observe the results of belief, and if faith evidently improves men, if, moreover, faith is in itself, considered as a physiological fact, evidently a necessity and a force, science will certainly b e obliged to admit it, and take the wise part of always reckoning with it. Let us now dare to affirm that there exists an immense fact equally appreciable both by faith and science; a fact which makes God visible (in a sense) upon earth; a fact incontesta ble and of universal bearing; this fact is the mani - festation in the world, beginning from the epoch when the"},{"pageNumber":293,"pageContent":"THE KE Y OF THE MYSTERIES 7 Christian revelation was made, of a spirit unknown to the ancients, of a spirit evidently divine, more positive than science in its works, in its aspirations, more magnificently ideal than the highest poetry, a spirit for which it was necessary to create a new name, a name altogether unheard 1 in the sanctuaries of antiquity. This name was created, and we shall demonstrate that this name, this word, is, in religion, as much for science as for faith, the expression of the absolute. The word is CHARITY, and the spirit of which we speak is the spirit of charity . Before charity, faith prostrates itself, and conquered science bows. There is here evidentl y something greater than humanity; charity proves by its works that it is not a dream. It is stronger than all the passions; it triumphs over suffering and over death; it makes God understood by every heart, and seems already to fill eternity by the beg un realization of its legitimate hopes.

The Emperor Maximus, a Spaniard, was inclined to put it down with a strong hand and confiscate the heretics’ property.

But St. Martin of Tours, stalwart champion of orthodoxy and he was, resisted, and in 385 he went to Trèves to plead for the persecuted Priscillianists. He prevailed. So long as Martin stayed at court the Ithacan party was foiled. When he left they had the upper hand again, and Maximus gave the suppression of the heretics into the hands of the unrelenting Evodius.

Then S t. Martin left his cell at Marmontier, and set out a second time to Trèves. News of the old man coming along the road on his ass reached his enemies. They met him at the gate and refused him entrance. “But,” said Martin, “I come with the peace of Jesus Christ.” And such was the power of his presence that they could not close the city gates against him. But the palace doors were closed. Martin refused to see the Ithacans or to receive the Communion with them, and their fury at this is eloquent testim ony to their sense of his power. They appealed to Maximus, who delivered over Martin bound to them. But in the night Maximus sent for Martin, argued, coaxed, persuaded him to compromise. The schism would be great, he persisted, if Martin continued to ex asperate the Ithacans. Martin said he had nothing to to with persecutors.

But when he knew the cause of Humanity safe, he departed, and on his way back to Tour s experienced a great agony. Why had he had dealings with the Ithacans? In a lonely place he pondered sadly. An angel spoke to him. “Martin, you do right to be sad, but it was the only way.” Never again did he go to any council. He was wont to say with tears that if he had saved the heretics he himself had lost power over men and over demons. They have outraged the meaning of the episode who explain Martin’s protest as merely against the surrender of the Church to Secular Power.

Nature herself induces us to believe; but the formulæ of faith are social expressions of the tendencies of faith at a given epoch.

God is neces sarily the most unknown of all beings because He is only defined by negative experience; He is all that we are not, He is the infinite opposed to the finite by hypothesis. Faith, and consequently hope and love, are so free that man, far from being able to impose them on others, does not even impose them on himself. “These,” says religion, “are graces.” Now, is it con - ceivable that grace should be subject to demand or exaction; that is to say, could any one wish to force men to a thing which comes freely an d without price from heaven? One must not do more than desire it for them. To reason concerning faith is to think irrationally, since the object of faith is outside the universe of reason. If one asks me: — “Is there a God?” I reply, “I believe it.” “B ut are you sure of it?” — “If I were sure of it, I should not believe it, I should know it.\" The formulation of faith is to agree upon the terms of the common hypothesis.

Faith is a divination of intelligence and of love, when these are directed by the pointings of nature and of reason.

Faith is an hypothetical realization and a conventional determination of the last aims of hope. It is the attach - ment to the visible sign of the things which one does not see. “Faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.” To affirm without folly that God is or that He is not, one must begin with a reasonable or unreasonable definition of God.

God hath given to His spirits light and life; then He said to them: “Love!” “What is — to love?” replied th e spirits. “To love is to give oneself to others,” replied God. “Those who love will suffer, but they will be loved.” “We have the right to give nothing, and we wish to suffer nothing,” said the spirits, hating love. “Remain in your right,” answered God, “and let us separate! I and Mine wish to suffer and even to die, to love. It is our duty!” The fallen angel is then he who, from the beginning, refused to love; he does not love, and that is his whole torture; he does not give, and that is his poverty; he does not suffer, and that is his nothingness; he does not die, and that is his exile. The fallen angel is not Lucifer the light - bearer; it is Satan, who calumniated love. To be rich is to give; to give nothing is to be poor; to live is to love; to lov e nothing is to be dead; to be happy is to devote oneself; to exist only for oneself is to cast away oneself, and to exile oneself in hell.

Faith does not consist of the affirmation of this symbol or that, but of a ge nuine and constant aspiration towards the truths which are veiled by all symbolisms. If a man rejects an unworthy idea of divinity, breaks its false images, revolts against hateful idolaters, you will call him an atheist! The authors of the persecutions in fallen Rome called the first Christians atheists, because they did not adore the idols of Caligula or of Nero. To deny a religion, even to deny all religions rather than adhere to formulae which conscience rejects, is a courageous and sublime act of faith . Every man who suffers for his convictions is a martyr of faith. He explains himself badly, it may be, but he prefers justice and truth to everything; do not condemn him without understanding him.

Cain and Abel represent the flesh and the spirit, force and intelligence, violence and harmony. The giants are those who usurped the earth in ancient times; the flood was a great revolution.

The universal empire could not realize itself by force, but by intelligence and love. Thus, to Nimrod, the man of savage ‘right,’ the Bible opposed Abraham, the man of duty, who goes voluntarily into exile in order to seek liberty and strife in a strange country, which he seizes by virtue of his Idea . He has a sterile wife, his thought, and a fertile slave, his force; but when force has produced its fruit, thought becomes fertil e; and the son of intelligence drives into exile the child of force. The man of intelligence is submitted to rude tests; he must confirm his conquests by sacrifices. God orders him to immolate his son, that is to say, doubt ought to test dogma, and the in tellectual man should be ready to sacrifice everything on the altar of supreme reason. Then God intervenes: universal reason yields to the efforts of labour, and shows herself to science; the material side of dogma is alone immolated. .

Property is the right to dispose of a portion of the common wealth; it is not the right to destroy, nor the right to sequestrate. To destroy or sequestrate the common wealth is not to possess; it is to steal. I say common wealth, because the true proprietor of all things is God, who wishes all things to belong to everybody. Whatever you may do, at your death you will carry away nothing of this world's goods. Now, that which must be taken away from you one day is not really yours. It ha s only been lent to you. As to the usufruct, it is the result of work; but even work is not an assured guarantee of possession, and war may come with devastation and fire to displace property. Make then good use of those things which perish, O you who will perish before they do! Consider that egoism provokes egoism, and that the im - morality of the rich man will answer for the crimes of the poor. What does the poor man wish, if he is honest? He wishes for work.

Marriage is the union of two beings joined by love, who promise each other mutual devotion in the interest of the children who may be born. Married persons who have a child, and who separate, are impious. Do they then wis h to execute the judgment of Solomon and hew the child asunder? To vow eternal love is puerile; sexual love is an emotion, divine doubtless, but accidental, involuntary and transitory; but the promise of reciprocal devotion is the essence of marriage and t he fundamental principle of the family. The sanction and the guarantee of this promise must then be an absolute confidence. Every jealousy is a suspicion, and every suspicion is an outrage. The real adultery is the breach of this trust: the woman who compl ains of her husband to another man; the man who confides to another woman the disappointments or the hopes of his heart, — these do, indeed, betray conjugal faith.

Husbands, hide your domestic wounds; do not strip your wives naked before the laughter of the mob! Women, do not advertise the discomforts of the conjugal bed: to do so is to write yourselves prostitutes in public opinion.

In order to formulate its aspirations, faith is forced to borrow aspirations and images from the known. But she specializes the employment of these forms, by placing them together in a manner which, in the known order of things, is impossibl e. Such is the profound reason of the apparent absurdity of symbolism. Let us give an example: If faith said that God was impersonal, one might conclude that God is only a word, or, at most, a thing. If it is said that God was a person, one would represent to oneself the intelligent infinite, under the necessarily bounded form of an individual. It says, “God is one in three persons,” in order to express that one conceives in God both unity and multiplicity. The formula of a mystery excludes necessarily the very intelligence of that formula, so far as it is borrowed from the world of known things; for, if one understood it, it would express the known and not the unknown. It would then belong to science, and no longer to religion, that is to say, to faith."},{"pageNumber":364,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 78 The object of faith is a mathematical problem, whose x escapes the procedures of our algebra.

Mystery is therefore eternal. To bring into the logic of the known the terms of a profession of fa ith is to withdraw them from faith, which has for positive bases anti - logic, that is to say, the impossibility of logically explaining the unknown.

For th e Mussulman, God is a word before which one prostrates oneself, on the authority of Mohammed.

In doing that, science admits that religion is right, and herself wrong; she lacks logic, manifests the disorder which every angry passion introduces into the spirit of man, and admits the need that it has of being ceaselessly redressed and directed by the spirit of charity.

Remain the objections of dissent. The Jews, our fathers in religion, reproach us with having attacked the unity of God, with having changed the immut - able and eternal law, with adoring the creature instead of the Creator. These heavy reproaches are founded on their perfectly false notion of Christianity. Our God is the God of Moses, unique, immaterial, infinite God, sole object of worship, and ever the same. Like the Jews, we believe Him to be present everywhere, but, as they ought to do, we believe Him living, thinking and loving in humanity, and we adore Him in His works. We have not changed His law, for the Jewish Decalogue is also the law of Christians. The law is immutable because it is founded on the eternal principles of Nature; but the worship necessitated by the needs of man may change, and modify itself, parallel with the changes in men themselves.

If you knew it , you could teach it to me; and when I knew it, I should no longer believe it. SCIENCE . Do you then believe without knowing what you believe? FAITH . Oh, do not let us play with words! It is you who do not know what I believe, and I believe it precisely because you do not know it. Do you pretend to be infinite? Are you not stopped at every step by mystery? Mystery is for you an infinite ignorance which would reduce to nothing your finite knowledge, if I did not illumine it with my burning aspirations; and if, when you say, “I no longer know,” I did not cry, “As for me, I begin to believe.” SCIENCE .

I make my children carry me. SCIENCE . They are the blind carrying the blind; beware of precipices! FAITH . No, my children are by no means blind; on the contrary, they enjoy twofold sight: they see, by thine eyes, what thou canst show them upon earth, and they contemplate, by mine, what I show them in Heaven. SCIENCE . What does Reason think of it? REASON . I think , my dear teachers, that you illustrate a touching fable, that of the blind man and the paralytic. Science reproaches Faith with not knowing how to walk upon the earth, and Faith says that Science sees nothing of her aspirations and of eternity in the sky .

Can you reason about the operations of the unknown? Can you understand the mysteries of charity? I must always be absurd for you; for, if you understood them, my affirmations would be absorbed by your theorems; I should be you, and you would be me; or, to put it better, I s hould no longer exist, and Reason, in the presence of the infinite, would halt, blinded for evermore by your doubts, which are as infinite as space. SCIENCE . At least, you should never usurp my authority, or give me the lie in my own domains. FAITH . I ha ve never done so, and I could never do so. SCIENCE . So! You have never believed, for example, that a virgin could become a mother, without ceasing to be a virgin, in the physical, natural, positive order of things, in spite of all the laws of Nature; you do not affirm that a piece of bread is not only a God, but a real human body with its bones and its veins, its organs, its blood; such, in short, that you make of your children who eat this bread a little race of cannibals. FAITH . There is not a single C hristian who would not be revolted by what you have just said. That sufficiently proves that they do not understand my teachings in this positive and gross sense.

By what right do you exclaim “Absurd!”? I do not reason about any of the things you know; by what right do you say that I talk unreasonably? SCIENCE . I begin to understand you, or rather, I see that I shall never understand you. This being so, let us remain separate; I shall never have need of you. FAITH . I am less proud, and I recognize that you may be useful to me perhaps. Perhaps, too, you will be very sad and very desperate without me , and I will not leave you unless Reason consents. REASON . Be well ’ware of doing so! I am necessary to both of you. And I, what should I do without you? In order to be just, I need to know and to believe. But I must never confound what I know with wh at I believe. To know is to believe no longer; to believe is not to know as yet. The object of Science is the known; Faith does not occupy itself with that, and leaves it all to Science. The object of Faith is the unknown; Science may seek it, but not d efine it; she is then obliged, at least provisionally, to accept the definitions of Faith which it is impossible for her even to criticize.

It is beautiful to be good. To be intelligently good, one must be just. To be just, one must act reasonably. To act reasonably, one must have the knowledge of reality. To have the knowledge of reality, one must have consciousness of truth. To have consciousness of truth, one must have an exact notion of being. Being, truth, reason and justice are the common objects of the researches of science, and of the aspirations of faith. The conceptions, whether real or hypothetical, of a supreme powe r transform justice into Providence; and the notion of divinity, from this point of view, becomes accessible to science herself. Science studies Being in its partial manifestation; faith supposes it, or rather admits it a priori as a whole.

Science submits the reasons of persons and things to the universal mathematical reason; faith seeks, or rather supposes, an intelligent and absolute reason for (and above) mathematics themselves. Science demonstrates justi ce by justness; faith gives an absolute justness to justice, in subordinating it to Providence. One sees here all that faith borrows from science, and all that science, in its turn, owes to faith. Without faith, science is circumscribed by an absolute doub t, and finds itself eternally penned within the risky empiricism of a reasoning scepticism; without science, faith constructs its hypotheses at random, and can only blindly prejudge the causes of the effects of which she is ignorant. The great chain which reunites science and faith is analogy. Science is obliged to respect a belief whose hypotheses are analogous to demonstrated truths. Faith, which attributes everything to God, is obliged to admit science as being a natural revelation which, by the partial manifestation of the laws of eternal reason, gives a scale of proportion to all the aspirations and to all the excursions of the soul into the domain of the unknown. It is, then, faith alone that can give a solution to the mysteries of science; and in ret urn, it is science alone that demonstrates the necessity of the mysteries of faith.

The relative demonstrates the existence of the absolute. Intelligence exists in being. Intelligence animates and modifies matter.” “Intelligence is everywhere,” says faith; “Life is nowhere fatal because it is ruled. This rule is th e expression of supreme Wisdom. The absolute in intelligence, the supreme regulator of forms, the living ideal of spirits, is God.” “In its identity with the ideal, being is truth,” says science. “In its identity with the ideal, truth is God,” replies fa ith. “In its identity with my demonstrations, being is reality,” says science. “In its identity with my legitimate aspirations, reality is my dogma,” says faith. “In its identity with the Word, being is reason,” says science. “In its identity with the spir it of charity, the highest reason is my obedience,” says faith. “In its identity with the motive of reasonable acts, being is justice,” says science. “In its identity with the principle of charity, justice is Providence,” replies faith.

And if there existed a faith which trampled science underfoot, we should not say that to laugh at such a faith would be a true act of religion, for religion, which is all charity , does not tolerate mockery; but one would be right in blaming this love for ignorance, and in saying to this rash faith, “Since you slight your sister, you are not the daughter of God!” Truth, reality, reason, justice, Providence, these are the five rays of the flamboyant star in the centre of which science will write the word “being,” — to which faith will add the ineffable name of God.

The soul, by acting on this light through its volitions, can dissolve it or coagulate it, project it or withdraw it. It is the mirror of the imagination and of dream s. It reacts upon the nervous system, and thus produces the movements of the body. This light can dilate itself indefinitely, and communicate its reflec - tions at considerable distances; it magnetizes the bodies submitted to the action of man, and can, by concentrating itself, again draw them to him. It can take all the forms evoked by thought, and, in the transitory coagulations of its radiant particles, appear to the eyes; it can even offer a sort of resistance to the touch. But these manifestations a nd uses of the plastic medium being abnormal, the luminous instru - ment of precision cannot produce them without being strained, and there is danger of either habitual hallucination, or of insanity.

Q .‚‚Is magnetism contrary to morality and religion? A .‚‚Yes, when one abuses it. Q .‚‚In what does the abuse of it consist? A .‚‚In employing i t in a disordered manner, or for a disordered object.

"},{"pageNumber":396,"pageContent":" 110 FIRST BOOK MAGNETIC MYSTERIES CHAPTER I THE KEY OF MESMERISM M ESMER rediscovered the secret science of Nature; he did not invent it. The first unique and elementary substance whose existence he proclaims in his aphorisms, was known by Hermes and Pythagoras. Synesius, who sings it in his hymns, had found it revealed in the Platonistic records of the School of Alexandria:  M...a pag¦, m...a ·...za  Trif£hj œkampe morf ́  . . . . . . .  Perˆ g¦r sp£reisa pnoi¦  CqonÕj ™zèwse mo...raj  Poludaid£loisi mÒraij “A single source, a single root of light, jets out and spreads itself into three branches of splendour. A breath blows round the earth, and vivifies in innumer - able forms all parts of animated substance.” ( H YMN II — Synesius .) Mesmer saw in elementary matter a substance indifferent to movement as to rest. Submitted to movement, it is volatile; fallen back into rest, it is fixed; and he d id not understand that movement is inherent in the first substance; that it results, not from its indifference, but from its aptitude, combined with a movement and a rest which are equilibrated"},{"pageNumber":397,"pageContent":"THE KE Y OF THE MYSTERIES 111 the one by the other; that absolute rest is nowhere in uni - ver sal living matter, but that the fixed attracts the volatile in order to fix it; while the volatile attacks the fixed in order to volatilize it. That the supposed rest of particles apparently fixed, in nothing but a more desperate struggle and a greater tension of their fluidic forces. which by neutralizing each other make themselves immobile. It is thus that, as Hermes says, that which is above is like that which is below; the same force which expands steam, contracts and hardens the icicle; everything obeys the laws of life which are inherent in the original substance; this substance attracts and repels, coagulates itself and dissolves itself, with a constant harmony; it is double; it is androgynous; it embraces itself, and fertilizes itself, it strugg les, triumphs, destroys, renews; but never aban - dons itself to inertia, because inertia, for it, would be death. It is this original substance to which the hieratic recital of Genesis refers when the word of Elohim creates light by commanding it to exist. The Elohim said, “Let there be light!” and there was light. This light, whose Hebrew name is rwa , aour , is the fluidic and living gold of the hermetic philosophy. Its positive principle is their sulphur; its negative principle, their mercury; and its equ ilibrated principles form what they call their salt. One must then, in place of the sixth aphorism of Mesmer which reads thus: “Matter is indifferent as to whether it is in movement or at rest,” establish this proposition: “The universal matter is compelle d to movement by its double magnetization, and its fate is to seek equilibrium.”"},{"pageNumber":398,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 112 Whence one may deduce these corollaries: Regularity and variety in movement result from the different combinations of equilibrium. A point equilibrated on all sides remains at rest, for the very reason that it is endowed with motion. Fluid consists of rapidly moving matter, always stirred by the variation of the balancing forces. A solid is the same matter in slow movement, or at apparent rest because it is more or less solidly balanced. There is no solid body which would not immediately be pulverized, vanish in smoke, and become invisible if the equilibrium of its molecules were to cease suddenly. There is no fluid which would not instantly become harder than the diamond, if on e could equilibrate its constituent molecules. To direct the magnetic forces is then to destroy or create forms; to produce to all appearance, or to destroy bodies; it is to exercise the almighty power of Nature. Our plastic medium is a magnet which attrac ts or repels the astral light under the pressure of the will. It is a luminous body which reproduces with the greatest ease forms corresponding to ideas. It is the mirror of the imagination. This body is nourished by astral light just as the organic body is nourished by the products of the earth. During slumber, it absorbs the astral light by immersion, and during waking, by a kind of somewhat slow respiration. When the phenomena of natural somnambulism are produced, the plastic medium is surcharged wi th ill - digested nourishment. The will, although bound by the torpor of slumber, repels instinctively the medium"},{"pageNumber":399,"pageContent":"THE KE Y OF THE MYSTERIES 113 towards the organs in order to disengage it, and a reaction, of mechanical nature, takes place, which with the movement of the body equilibra tes the light of the medium. It is for that reason that it so dangerous to wake somnambulists suddenly, for the gorged medium may then withdraw itself suddenly towards the common reservoir, and abandon the organs altogether; these are then separated from the soul, and death is the result. The state of somnambulism, whether natural or artificial, is then extremely dangerous, because in uniting the phenomena of the waking state and the state of slumber, it constitutes a sort of straddle between two worlds. The soul moves the springs of the particular life while bathing itself in the universal life, and experiences an inexpressible sense of well - being; it will then willingly let go the nervous branches which hold it suspended above the current. In ecstasies of every kind the situation is the same. If the will plunges into it with a passionate effort, or even abandons itself entirely to it, the subject may become insane or paralysed, or even die. Hallucinations and vision result from wounds inflicted on the p lastic medium, and from its local paralysis. Sometimes it ceases to give forth rays, and substitutes images condensed somehow or other to realities shown by the light; sometimes it radiates with too much force, and condense itself outside and around some chance and irregulated nucleus, as blood does in some bodily growths.

But in a contrary sense; somnambulism is slumber borrowing its phenomena from waking; hallucination is waking still partially subjected to the astral intoxi cation of slumber. Our fluidic bodies attract and repulse each other following laws similar to those of electricity. It is this which produces instinctive sympathies and antipathies. They thus equilibrate each other, and for this reason hallucinations ar e often contagious; abnormal projections change the luminous currents; the perturbation caused by a sick person wins over to itself the more sensitive natures; a circle of illusions is established, and a whole crowd of people is easily dragged away thereby . Such is the history of strange apparitions and popular prodigies. Thus are explained the miracles of the American mediums and the hysterics of table - turners, who reproduce in our own times the ecstasies of whirling dervishes. The sorcerers of Lapland with their magic drums, and the conjurer medicine - men of savages arrive at similar results by similar proceedings; their gods or their devils have nothing to do with it. Madmen and idiots are more sensitive to magnetism than people of sound minds; it shoul d be easy to understand the reason of that: very little is required to turn completely the head of a drunken man, and one more easily acquires a disease when all the organs are predisposed to submit to its impressions, and manifest its disorders.

These phenomena are constant like nature, inexorable as fatality.

Her fault, if one may be permitted to reproach her with one, was that, at first, she madly and passionately loved her husband. “But,” you will say, “is not the human soul, then, free?” No, it is no longer free when it has abandoned itself to the giddiness caused by passion. It is only wisdom which is free; disordered passions are the kingdom of folly, and folly is fatality. What we have said of love may equally well be said of religion, w hich is the most powerful, but also the most intoxi - cating, of all loves. Religious passion has also its excesses and"},{"pageNumber":402,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 116 its fatal reactions. One may have ecstasies and stigmata like St. Francis of Assisi, and fall afterwards into abysses of debauch and imp iety. Passionate natures are highly charged magnets; they attract or repel with violence. It is possible to magnetize in two ways: first, in acting by will upon the plastic medium of another person, whose will and whose acts are, in consequence, subordinat ed to that action. Secondly, in acting through the will of another, either by intimidation, or by persuasion, so that the influenced will modifies at our pleasure the plastic medium and the acts of that person. One magnetizes by radiation, by contact, by l ook, or by word. The vibrations of the voice modify the movement of the astral light, and are a powerful vehicle of magnetism. The warm breath magnetizes positively, and the cold breath negatively. A warm and prolonged insufflation upon the spinal column a t the base of the cerebellum may occasion erotic phenomena. If one puts the right hand upon the head and the left hand under the feet of a person completely enveloped with wool or silk, one causes the magnetic spark to pass completely through the body, and one may thus occasion a nervous revolution in his organism with the rapidity of lightning. Magnetic passes only serve to direct the will of the mag - netizer in confirming it by acts. They are signs and nothing more. The act of the will is expressed and n ot operated by these signs."},{"pageNumber":403,"pageContent":"THE KE Y OF THE MYSTERIES 117 Powdered charcoal absorbs and retains the astral light. This explains the magic mirror of Dupotet. Figures traced in charcoal appear luminous to a magnetized person, and take, for him, following the direction indicated by the w ill of the magnetizer, the most gracious or the most terrifying forms. The astral light, or rather the vital light, of the plastic medium, absorbed by the charcoal, becomes wholly negative; for this reason animals which are tormented by electricity, as fo r example, cats, love to roll themselves upon coal. One day, medicine will make use of this property, and nervous persons will find great relief from it. CHAPTER II LIFE AND DEATH . — SLEEP AND WAKING S LEEP is an incomplete death; death is a complete s leep. Nature subjects us to sleep in order to accustom us to the idea of death, and warns us by dreams of the persistence of another life. The astral light into which sleep plunges us is like an ocean in which innumerable images are afloat, flotsam of wrec ked existences, mirages and reflections of those which pass, presentiments of those which are about to be. Our nervous disposition attracts to us those images which correspond to our agitation, to the nature of our fatigue, just as a magnet, moved among pa rticles of various metals, would attract to itself and choose particularly the iron filings."},{"pageNumber":404,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 118 Dreams reveal to us the sickness or the health, the calm or the disturbance, of our plastic medium, and consequently, also, that of our nervous apparatus. They for mulate our presentiments by the analogy which the images bear to them. For all ideas have a double significance for us, relating to our double life. There exists a language of sleep; in the waking state it is impossible to understand it, or even to order i ts words. The language of slumber is that of nature, hieroglyphic in its character, and rhythmical in its sounds. Slumber may be either giddy or lucid. Madness is a permanent state of vertiginous somnambu - lism. A violent disturbance may wake madmen to sens e, or kill them. Hallucinations, when they obtain the adhesion of the intelligence, are transitory attacks of madness. Every mental fatigue provokes slumber; but if the fatigue is accompanied by nervous irritation, the slumber may be incomplete, and take o n the character of somnambulism. One sometimes goes to sleep without knowing it in the midst of real life; and then instead of thinking, one dreams. How is it that we remember things which have never happened to us? Because we dreamt them when wide awake. This phenomenon of involuntary and unperceived sleep when it suddenly traverses real life, often happens to those who over - excite their nervous organism by excesses either of work, vigil, drink, or erethism."},{"pageNumber":405,"pageContent":"THE KE Y OF THE MYSTERIES 119 Monomaniacs are asleep when they perform unreas onable acts. They no longer remember anything on waking. When Papvoine was arrested by the police, he calmly said to them these remarkable words: You are taking the other for me . It was the somnambulist who was still speaking. Edgar Poe, that unhappy ma n of genius who used to intoxicate himself, has terribly described the somnambulism of monomaniacs. Sometimes it is an assassin who hears, and who thinks that everybody hears, through the wall of the tomb, the beating of his victim's heart; sometimes it i s a poisoner who, by dint of saying to himself, “I am safe, pro - vided I do not go and denounce myself,” ends by dreaming aloud that he is denouncing himself, and in fact does so. Edgar Poe himself invented neither the persons nor the facts of these strang e novels; he dreamt them waking, and that is why he clothed them so well with all the colours of a shocking reality. Dr. Briere de Boismont in his remarkable work on “Hal - lucinations,” tells the story of an Englishman otherwise quite sane, who thought that he had met a stranger and made his acquaintance, who took him to lunch at his tavern, and then having asked him to visit St. Paul's in his company, had tried to throw him from the top of the tower which they had climbed together. From that moment the Engl ishman was obsessed by this stranger, whom he alone could see, and whom he always met when he was alone, and had dined well. Precipices attract; drunkenness calls to drunkenness; madness has invincible charms for madness. When a man"},{"pageNumber":406,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 120 succumbs to sleep, he holds in horror everything which might wake him. It is the same with the hallucinated, with statical somnambulists, maniacs, epileptics, and all those who abandon themselves to the delirium of a passion. They have heard the fatal music, they have entered into the dance of death; and they feel themselves dragged away into the whirl of vertigo. You speak to them, they no more hear you; you warn them, they no longer understand you, but your voice annoys them; they are asleep with the sleep of death. Death i s a current which carries you away, a whirlpool which draws you down, but from the bottom of which the least movement may make you climb again. The force or repulsion being equal to that of attraction, at the very moment of expiring, one often attaches on eself again violent to life. Often also, by the same law of equilibrium, one passes from sleep to death through complaisance for sleep. A shallop sways upon the shores of the lake. The child enters the water, which, shining with a thousand reflections, d ances around him and calls him; the chain which retains the boat stretches and seems to wish to break itself; then a marvellous bird shoots out from the bank, and skims, singing, upon the joyous waves; the child wishes to follow it, he puts his hand upon t he chain, he detaches the ring. Antiquity divined the mystery of the attraction of death, and represented it in the fable of Hylas. Weary with a long voyage, Hylas has arrived in a flowered, enamelled isle; he approaches a fountain to draw water; a gracio us mirage smiles at him; he sees a nymph stretch out her arms to him, his own lose nerve, and cannot draw back the heavy jar; the fresh fragrance of the spring put him to sleep; the perfumes"},{"pageNumber":407,"pageContent":"THE KE Y OF THE MYSTERIES 121 of the bank intoxicate him. There he is, bent over the water l ike a narcissus whose stalk has been broken by a child at play; the full jar falls to the bottom, and Hylas follows it; he dies, dreaming that nymphs caress him, and no longer hears the voice of Hercules recalling him to the labours of life; Hercules, who runs wildly everywhere, crying, “Hylas! Hylas!” Another fable, not less touching, which steps forth from the shadows of the Orphic initiation, is that of Eurydice recalled to life by the miracles of harmony and love, of Eurydice, that sensitive broken on t he very day of her marriage, who takes refuge in the tomb, trembling with modesty. Soon she hears the lyre of Orpheus, and slowly climbs again towards the light; the terrible divinities of Erebus dare not bar her passage. She follows the poet, or rathe r the poetry which adores. . . . But, woe to the lover if he changes the magnetic current and pursues in his turn, with a single look, her whom he should only attract! The sacred love, the virginal love, the love which is stronger than the tomb, seeks o nly devotion, and flies in terror before the egoism of desire. Orpheus knows it; but, for an instant, he forgets it. Eury - dice, in her white bridal dress, lies upon the marriage bed; he wears the vestments of Grand Hierophant, he stands upright, his ly re in his hand, his head crowned with the sacred laurel, his eyes turned towards the East, and he sings. He sings of the luminous arrows of love that traverse the shadows of old Chaos, the waves of soft, clear light, flowing from the black teats of the m other of the gods, from which hang the two children, Eros and Anteros. He says the song of Adonis returning to life in answer to the complaint of Venus, reviving like a flower under the shining dew of her"},{"pageNumber":408,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 122 tears; the song of Castor and Pollux, whom death could not divide, and who love alternately in hell and upon earth. . . . Then he calls softly Eurydice, his dear Eurydice, his so much loved Eurydice: Ah! miseram Eurydicen anima fugiente vocabat, Eurydicen! toto referebant flumine ripae. While he sings, that pallid statue of the sculptor death takes on the colour of the first tint of life, its white lips begin to redden like the dawn . . . Orpheus sees her, he trembles, he stammers, the hymn almost dies upon his lips, but she pales anew; then the Grand H ierophant tears from his lyre sublime heartrending songs, he looks no more save upon Heaven, he weeps, he prays, and Eurydice opens her eyes . . . Unhappy one, do not look at her! sing! sing! do not scare away the butterfly of Psyche, which is about to al ight on this flower! But the insensate man has seen the look of the woman whom he has raised from the dead, the Grand Hiero - phant gives place to the lover, his lyre falls from his hands, he looks upon Eurydice, he darts towards her, . . . he clasps her in his arms, he finds her frozen still, her eyes are closed again, her lips are paler and colder than ever, the sensitive soul has trembled, the frail cord is broken anew — and for ever. . . . Eurydice is dead, and the hymns of Orpheus can no longer recall he r to life! In our Dogme et rituel de la haute magie , we had the temerity to say that the resurrection of the dead is not an impossible phenomenon even on the physical plane; and in saying that, we have not denied or in any way contradicted the fatal law of death. A death which can discontinue is only lethargy and slumber; but it is by lethargy and slumber that"},{"pageNumber":409,"pageContent":"THE KE Y OF THE MYSTERIES 123 death always begins. The state of profound peace which succeeds the agitations of life carries away the relaxed and sleeping soul; one cannot make it return, and force it to plunge anew into life, except by exciting violently all its affections and all its desires. When Jesus, the Saviour of the world, was upon earth, the earth was more beautiful and more desirable than Heaven; and yet it was neces sary for Jesus to cry aloud and apply a shock in order to awaken Jairus’s daughter. It was by dint of shudderings and tears that he called back his friend Lazarus from the tomb, so difficult is it to interrupt a tired soul who is sleeping his beauty - slee p! At the same time, the countenance of death has not the same serenity for every soul that contemplates it. When one has missed the goal of life, when one carries away with one frenzied greeds or unassuaged hates, eternity appears to the ignorant or guil ty soul with such a formidable proportion of sorrows, that it sometimes tries to fling itself back into mortal life. How many souls, urged by the nightmare of hell, have taken refuge in their frozen bodies, their bodies already covered with funereal marbl e! Men have found skeletons turned over, convulsed, twisted, and they have said, “Here are men who have been buried alive.” Often this was not the case. These may always be waifs of death, men raised from the tomb, who, before they could abandon themsel ves altogether to the anguish of the threshold of eternity, were obliged to make a second attempt. A celebrated magnetist, Baron Dupotet, teaches in his secret book on Magic that one can kill by magic as by electricity. There is nothing strange in this re velation for"},{"pageNumber":410,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 124 anyone who is well acquainted with the analogies of Nature. It is certain that in diluting beyond measure, or in coagulating suddenly, the plastic medium of a subject, it is possible to loose the body from the soul. It is sometimes sufficien t to arouse a violent anger, or an overmastering fear in anyone, to kill him suddenly. The habitual use of magnetism usually puts the subject who abandons himself to it at the mercy of the magnetizer. When communication is well - established, and the magnet izer can produce at will slumber, insensibility, catalepsy, and so on, it will only require a little further effort to bring on death. We have been told as an actual fact a story whose authenticity we will not altogether guarantee. We are about to repeat i t because it may be true. Certain persons who doubted both religion and magnetism, of that incredulous class which is ready for all superstitions and all fanaticisms, had persuaded a poor girl to submit to their experiments for a fee. This girl was of an impressionable and nervous nature, fatigued moreover by the excesses of a life which had been more than irregular, while she was already disgusted with existence. They put her to sleep; bade her see; she weeps and struggles. They speak to her of God; she trembles in every limb. “No,” said she, “no; He frightens me; I will not look at Him.” “Look at Him, I wish it.” She opens her eyes, her pupils expand; she is terrifying. “What do you see?” “I should not know how to say it. . . . Oh for pity's sake awaken me!”"},{"pageNumber":411,"pageContent":"THE KE Y OF THE MYSTERIES 125 “No, look, and say what you see.” “I see a black night in which whirl sparks of every colour around two great ever - rolling eyes.

Wake me!” “No, look.” “Where do you wish me to look now?” “Look into Paradise.” “No, I cannot climb there; the great night pushes me back, I always fall back.” “Very well then, look into hell.” Here the sleep - waker became convulsively agitated. “No, no!” she cried sobbing; “I will not! I sh all be giddy; I should fall! Oh, hold me back! Hold me back!” “No, descend.” “Where do you want me to descend?” “Into hell.” “But it is horrible! No! No!

It is my will.” The features of the sleep - waker become terrible to behold; her hair stands on end; her wide - opened eyes show only the white; her breast heaves, and a sort of death - rattle escapes from her throat. “Go there. It is my will,” repeats the magnetizer. “I am there!” says the unhappy gir l between her teeth, falling back exhausted.

It was to the public incredulity in the matter of magnetism that the authors of this sacrilegious experiment owed their own immunity from prosecution. The authorities held an inquest, and death was attributed to the rupture of an aneuri sm. The body, anyhow, bore no trace of violence; they had it buried, and there was an end of the matter. Here is another anecdote which we heard from a travelling companion. Two friends were staying in the same inn, and sharing the same room. One of them had a habit of talking in his sleep, and, at that time, would answer the questions which his comrade put to him. One night, he suddenly uttered stifled cries; his companion woke up and asked him what was the matter. “But, don’t you see,” said the sleeper , “don’t you see that enormous stone . . . it is becoming loose from the mountain . . . it is falling on me, it is going to crush me.\" “Oh, well, get out of its way!” “Impossible! My feet are caught in brambles that cling ever closer. Ah! Help! Help! There is the great stone coming right upon me!” “Well, there it is!” said the other laughing, throwing the pillow at his head in order to wake him. A terrible cry, suddenly strangled in his throat, a con - vulsion, a sigh, then nothing more. The practical j oker gets up, pulls his comrade's arm, calls him; in his turn, he becomes frightened, he cries out, people come with lights . . . the unfortunate sleep - waker was dead. "},{"pageNumber":413,"pageContent":"THE KEY OF THE MYSTERIES 127 CHAPTER III MYSTERIES OF HALL UCINATIONS AND OF TH E EVOCATION OF SPIRITS A N hallucinati on is an illusion produced by an irregular movement of the astral light. It is, as we said previously, the admixture of the phenomena of sleep with those of waking. Our plastic medium breathes in and out the astral light or vital soul of the earth, as our body breathes in and out the terrestrial atmosphere. Now, just as in certain places the air is impure and not fit for breathing, in the same way, certain unusual circumstances may make the astral light unwholesome, and not assimilable. The air of some pl aces may be too bracing for some people, and suit others perfectly; it is exactly the same with the magnetic light. The plastic medium is like a metallic statue always in a state of fusion. If the mould is defective, it becomes deformed; if the mould bre aks, it runs out. The mould of the plastic medium is balanced and polarized vital force. Our body, by means of the nervous system, attracts and retains this fugitive form of light; but local fatigue, or partial over - excitement of the apparatus, may occasio n fluidic deformities. These deformities partially falsify the mirror of the imagination, and thus occasion habitual hallucinations to the static type of visionary. The plastic medium, made in the image and likeness of our"},{"pageNumber":414,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 128 body, of which it figures every o rgan in light, has a sight, touch, hearing, smell and taste which are proper to itself; it may, when it is over - excited, communicate them by vibrations to the nervous apparatus in such a manner that the halluci - nation is complete. The imagination seems th en to triumph over Nature itself, and produces truly strange phenomena. The material body, deluged with fluid, seems to participate in the fluidic qualities, it escapes from the operation of the laws of gravity, becomes momentarily invulnerable, and even invisible, in a circle of persons suffering from collective hallucination. The convulsionaries of St. Medard, as one knows, had their flesh torn off with red - hot pincers, had them - selves felled like oxen, and ground like corn, and crucified, without suffe ring any pain; they were levitated, walked about head downwards, and ate bent pins and digested them. We think we ought to recapitulate here the remarks which we published in the Estafette on the prodigies pro - duced by the American medium Home, and on sev eral phenomena of the same kind. We have never personally witnessed Mr. Home's miracles, but our information comes from the best sources; we gathered it in a house where the American medium had been received with kindness when he was in misfortune, and wi th indulgence when he reached the point of thinking that his illness was a piece of good luck; in the house of a lady born in Poland, but thrice French by the nobility of her heart, the indescribable charm of her spirit, and the European celebrity of her n ame.

We at least showed ourself a good Christian in pitying and forgiving him, and as it is impossible to be an unfrocked priest without ever having been a priest, we let fall to the ground an insult which did not reach us. S POOKS IN P ARIS . Mr. Home, a week ago, was once more about to quit Paris, that Paris where even the angels and the demons, if they appeared in any shape, would not pass very long for marvellous beings, and would find nothing better to do than to return at top - speed to heaven or to hell, to escape the forgetfulness and the neglect of human kind.

Mme. de B . . . treated him very kindly that day, as always, and asked him to stay to dinner; the man of mystery was about to accept, when, some one having jus t said that they were waiting for a qabalist, well known in the world of occult science by the publication of a book entitled Dogme et rituel de la haute magie , Mr. Home suddenly changed countenance, and said, stammering, and with a visible embarrassment, that he could not remain, and that the approach of this Professor of Magic caused him an incomparable terror. Everything one could say to reassure him proved useless. “I do not presume to judge the man,” said he; “I do not"},{"pageNumber":416,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 130 assert that he is good or ev il, I know nothing about it; but his atmosphere hurts me; near him I should feel myself, as it were, without force, even without life.” After which explanation. Mr. Home hastened to salute and withdraw. This terror of miracle - mongers in the presence of the veritable initiates of science, is not a new fact in the annals of occultism. You may read in Philostratus the history of the Lamia who trembles on hearing the approach of Apollonius of Tyana. Our admirable story - teller Alexander Dumas dramatized th is magical anecdote in the magnificent epitome of all legends which forms the prologue to his great epic novel, “The Wandering Jew.” 1 The scene takes place at Corinth; it is an old - time wedding with its beautiful children crowned with flowers, bearing the nuptial torches, and singing gracious epithalamia flowered with voluptuous images like the poems of Catullus. The bride is as beautiful in her chaste draperies as the ancient Polyhumnia; she is amorous and deliciously provoking in her modesty, like a Venu s of Correggio, or a Grace of Canova. The bridegroom is Clinias, a disciple of the famous Apollonius of Tyana. The master had promised to come to his disciple's wedding, but he does not arrive, and the fair bride breathes easier, for she fears Apolloniu s. However, the day is not over. The hour has arrived when the newly married are to be conducted to the nuptial couch. Meroe trembles, pales, looks obstinately towards the door, stretches out her hand with alarm and says in a strangled voice: “Here he i s! It is he!” It was in fact Apollonius. Here is the magus; here is the master; the hour of enchantments has passed; jugglery falls before true 1 Some authorities attribute this novel to Eugène Sue. — T RANS ."},{"pageNumber":417,"pageContent":"THE KE Y OF THE MYSTERIES 131 science. One seeks the lovely bride, the white Meroe, and one sees no more than an old woman, the sorceress Canidia, the devourer of little children. Clinias is disabused; he thanks his master, he is saved. The vulgar are always deceived about magic, and confuse adepts with enchanters. True magic, that is to say, the traditional science of the magi, is the mo rtal enemy of enchantment; it prevents, or makes to cease, sham miracles, hostile to the light, that fascinate a small number of pre - judiced or credulous witnesses. The apparent disorder in the laws of Nature is a lie: it is not then a miracle. The true miracle, the true prodigy always flaming in the eyes of all, is the ever constant harmony of effect and cause; these are the splendours of eternal order! We could not say whether Cagliostro would have per - formed miracles in the presence of Swedenborg; but he would certainly have dreaded the presence of Paracelsus and of Henry Khunrath, if these great men had been his contemporaries. Far be it from us, however, to denounce Mr. Home as a low - class sorcerer, that is to say, as a charlatan. The cele - brated Ame rican medium is sweet and natural as a child. He is a poor and over - sensitive being, without cunning and with - out defence; he is the plaything of a terrible force of whose nature he is ignorant, and the first of his dupes is certainly himself.

Facts are inexorable, and genuine good faith should never fear to examine them. The explanation of these facts, which all traditions obstinately affi rm, and which are reproduced before our eyes with tiresome publicity, this explanation, ancient as the facts themselves, rigorous as mathematics, but drawn for the first time from the shadows in which the hierophants of all ages have hidden it, would be a great scientific event if it could obtain sufficient light and publicity. This event we are perhaps about to prepare, for one would not permit us the audacious hope of accomplishing it. Here, in the first place, are the facts, in all their singularity. W e have verified them, and we have established them with a rigorous exactitude, abstaining in the first place from all explanation and all commentary. Mr. Home is subject to trances which put him, according to his own account, in direct communication with t he soul of his mother, and, through her, with the entire world of spirits. He describes, like the sleep - wakers of Cahagnet, persons whom he has never seen, and who are recognized by those who evoke them; he will tell you even their names, and will reply, on their behalf, to questions which can be understood only by the soul evoked and yourselves. When he is in a room, inexplicable noises make themselves heard. Violent blows resound upon the furniture, and in the walls; sometimes doors and windows open by themselves, as if they were blown open by a storm; one even hears the wind and the rain, though when one goes out of doors, the sky"},{"pageNumber":419,"pageContent":"THE KE Y OF THE MYSTERIES 133 is cloudless, and one does not feel the lightest breath of wind. The furniture is overturned and displace, without anybody touching it. Pencils write of their own accord. Their writing is that of Mr. Home, and they make the same mistakes as he does. Those present feel themselves touched and seized by invisible hands. These contacts, which seem to select ladies, lack a seriou s side, and sometimes even propriety. We think that we shall be sufficiently understood. Visible and tangible hands come out, or seem to come out, of tables; but in this case, the tables must be covered. The invisible agent needs certain apparatus, just as do the cleverest successors of Robert Houdin. These hands show themselves above all in darkness; they are warm and phosphorescent, or cold and black. They write stupidities, or touch the piano; and when they have touched the piano, it is necessary to s end for the tuner, their contact being always fatal to the exactitude of the instrument. One of the most considerable personages in England, Sir Bulwer Lytton, has seen and touched those hands; we have read his written and signed attestation. He declares even that he has seized them, and drawn them towards himself with all his strength, in order to withdraw from their incognito the arm to which they should naturally be attached. But the invisible object has proved stronger than the English novelist, and t he hands have escaped him. A Russian nobleman who was the protector of Mr. Home, and whose character and good faith could not possibly be doubted, Count A. B —— , has also seen and seized with"},{"pageNumber":420,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 134 vigor the mysterious hands. “They are,” says he, “perfect shape s of human hands, warm and living, only one feels no bones .” Pressed by an unavoidable constraint, those hands did not struggle to escape, but grew smaller, and in some way melted, so that the Count ended by no longer holding anything. Other persons who h ave seen them, and touched them, say that the fingers are puffed out and stiff, and compare them to gloves of india - rubber, swollen with a warm and phosphorescent air. Sometimes, instead of hands, it is feet which produce themselves, but never naked. The spirit, which probably lacks footwear, respects (at least in this particular) the delicacy of ladies, and never shows his feet but under a drapery or a cloth. The production of these feet very much tires and frightens Mr. Home. He then endeavours to appr oach some healthy person, and seizes him like a drowning man; the person so seized by the medium feels himself, on a sudden, in a singular state of exhaustion and debility. A Polish gentleman, who was present at one of the séances of Mr. Home, had placed o n the ground between his feet a pencil on a paper, and had asked for a sign of the presence of the spirit. For some instants nothing stirred, but suddenly, the pencil was thrown to the other end of the room. The gentleman stooped, took the paper, and saw there three qabalistic signs which nobody understood. Mr. Home (alone) appeared, on seeing them, to be very much upset, and even frightened; but he refused to explain himself as to the nature and significance of these characters. The investigators accor d - ingly kept them, and took them to that Professor of High"},{"pageNumber":421,"pageContent":"THE KE Y OF THE MYSTERIES 135 Magic whose approach had been so much dreaded by the medium. We have seen them, and here is a minute description of them. They were traced forcibly, and the pencil had almost cut the paper. They h ad been dashed on to the paper without order or alignment. The first was the symbol which the Egyptian initiates usually placed in the hand of Typhon. A tau with upright double lines opened in the form of a compass; an ankh (or crux ansata) having at the top a circular ring; below the ring, a double horizontal line; beneath the double horizontal line, two oblique lines, like a V upside down. The second character represented a Grand Hierophant's cross, with the three hierarchical cross - bars. This symbol, w hich dates from the remotest antiquity, is still the attribute of our sovereign pontiffs, and forms the upper extremity of their pastoral staff. But the sign traced by the pencil had this particularity, that the upper branch, the head of the cross, was do uble, and formed again the terrible Typhonian V, the sign of antagonism and separation, the symbol of hate and eternal combat. The third character was that which Freemasons call the Philosophical Cross, a cross with four equal arms, with a point in each of its angles. But, instead of four points, there were only two, placed in the two right - hand corners, once more a sign of struggle, separation and denial.

The first is the signature of Typhon. It expresses the blasphemy of the evil spirit by establishing dualism in the creative princi ple. For the crux ansata of Osiris is a lingam upside down, and represents the paternal and active force of God (the vertical line extending from the circle) fertilizing passive nature (the horizontal line). To double the vertical line is to affirm that nature has two fathers; it is to put adultery in the place of the divine motherhood, it is to affirm, instead of the principle of intelligence, blind fatality, which has for result the eternal conflict of appearances in nothingness; it is, then, the most ancient, the most authentic, and the most terrible of all the stigmata of hell.

One thing, however, is re - markable in the invectives of which he is the object: his adversaries, though straining every effort in order to scourge him, recognize the truth of his miracles, and content them - selves with attributing them to the devil. What, then, are these so authentic miracles of Vintras? On this subject we are better informed than anybody, as will soon appear. Affidavits signed by honourable witnesses, persons who are artists, doctors, priests, all men above reproach, have been communicated to us; we have questioned eye - witnesses, and, better than that, we have seen with our own eyes. The facts deserve to be described in detail. There is in Paris a writer named Mr. Madrolle, w ho is, to say the least of it, a bit eccentric. He is an old man of good family. He wrote at first on behalf of Catholicism in the most exalted way, received most flattering encouragements from ecclesiastical authority, and even letters from the Holy See . Then he saw Vintras; and, led away by the prestige of his miracles, became a determined sectarian, and an irreconcilable enemy of the hierarchy and of the clergy. At the period when Eliphas Levi was publishing his Dogme et rituel de la haute magie , he r eceived a pamphlet from Mr. Madrolle which astonished him. In it, the author vigorously sustained the most unheard of paradoxes in the disordered style of the ecstatics. For him, life sufficed for"},{"pageNumber":425,"pageContent":"THE KE Y OF THE MYSTERIES 139 the expiation of the greatest crimes, since it was the c onse - quence of a sentence of death. The most wicked men, being the most unhappy of all, seemed to him to offer the sublimest of expiations to God. He broke all bounds in his attack on all repression and all damnation. “A religion which damns,” he cried , “is a damned religion!” He further preached the most absolute licence under the pretext of charity, and so far forgot himself as to say, that the most imperfect and the most apparently reprehensible act of love was worth more than the best of prayers . 1 It was the Marquis de Sade turned preacher! 2 Further, he denied the existence of the devil with an enthusiasm often full of eloquence. “Can you conceive,” said he, “a devil tolerated and authorized by God? Can you conceive, further, a God who made the de vil, and who allowed him to ravage creatures already so weak, and so prompt to deceive themselves! A god of the devil, in short, abetted, protected, and scarcely surpassed in his revenges, by a devil of a god!” The rest of the pamphlet was of the same vi gour. The Professor of Magic was almost frightened, and inquired the address of Mr. Madrolle. It was not without some trouble that he obtained an interview with this singular pamphleteer, and here is, more or less, their conversation: E LIPHAS L EVI . “Si r, I have received a pamphlet from you. 1 Quoted with approval in the Solution of the First Problem, IX, p. 52 . — O.

An empty chalice was upon the altar, a chalice well known to the Abbe Charvo z; he brought it himself from his church of Mont - Louis, and he was perfectly certain that the sacred vase had neither secret ducts nor double bottom. “ ‘In order to prove to you,’ said Vintras, ‘that it is God Himself who inspires me, He acquaints me that this chalice will fill itself with drops of His blood, under the appearance of wine, and you will all be able to taste the fruit of the vines of the future, the wine which we shall drink with the Saviour in the Kingdom of His Father. . .’ “Overcome with as tonishment and fear,” continued the Abbe Charvoz, “I go up to the altar, I take the chalice, I look at the bottom of it: it was entirely empty. I overturned it in the sight of everyone, then I returned to kneel at the foot of the altar, holding the chalic e between my two hands . . . Suddenly there was a slight noise; the noise of a drop of water, falling into the chalice from the ceiling, was distinctly heard, and a drop of wine appeared at the bottom of the vase. “Every eye was fixed on me. Then they lo oked at the ceiling, for our simple chapel was held in a poor room; in the ceiling was neither hole nor fissure; nothing was seen to fall, and yet the noise of the fall of the drops multiplied, it became more rapid, and more frequent, . . and the wine clim bed from the bottom of the chalice towards the brim. “When the chalice was full, I bore it slowly around so that all might see it; then the prophet dipped his lips into it, and all, one after the other, tasted the miraculous wine.

And what shall I tell you,” added the Abbe Charvoz, “of those miracles of blood which astonish us every day? Thousands of wounded and bleeding hosts are found upon our altars. The sacred stigmata appear to all who wish to see them. The hosts, at first white, slowly become marked with characters and hearts in blood. . . . Must one believe that God abandons the holiest objects to the false miracles of the devil? Should not one rather ado re, and believe that the hour of the supreme and final revelation has arrived?” Abbe Charvoz, as he thus spoke, had in his voice that sort of nervous trembling that Eliphas Levi had already noticed in the case of Mr. Madrolle. The magician shook his head pensively; then, suddenly: “Sir,” said he to the Abbe; “you have upon you one or two of these miraculous hosts. Be good enough to show them to me.” “Sir —— ” “You have some, I know it; why should you deny it?” “I do not deny it,” said Abbe Charvoz; “but yo u will permit me not to expose to the investigations of incredulity objects of the most sincere and devout belief.” “Reverend sir,” said Eliphas gravely; “incredulity is the mistrust of an ignorance almost sure to deceive itself. Science is not incredulo us. I believe, to begin with, in you own conviction, since you have accepted a life of privation and even of reproach, in order to stick to this unhappy belief. Show me then your miraculous hosts, and believe entirely in my respect for the objects of a s incere worship.”"},{"pageNumber":434,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 148 “Oh, well!” said the Abbe Charvoz, after another slight hesitation; “I will show them to you.” Then he unbuttoned the top of his black waistcoat and drew forth a little reliquary of silver, before which he fell on his knees, with tears in his eyes, and prayers on his lips; Eliphas fell on his knees beside him, and the Abbe opened the reliquary. There were in the reliquary three hosts, one whole, the two others almost like paste, and as it were kneaded with blood. The whole host bore in its centre a heart in relief on both sides; a clot of blood moulded in the form of a heart, which seemed to have been formed in the host itself in an inexplicable manner. The blood could not have been applied from without, for the imbibed colouring matter had left the particles adhering to the exterior surface quite white. The appearance of the phenomenon was the same on both sides. The Master of Magic was seized with an involuntary trembling. This emotion did not escape the old vicar, who having once again done adoration and closed his reliquary, drew from his pocket an album, and gave it without a word to Eliphas. . . . There were copies of all the bleeding characters which had been observed upon hosts since the beginning of the ecstasies and miracles of Vintras. There were hearts of every kind, and many different sorts of emblems. But three especially excited the curiosity of Eliphas to the highest point. “Reverend sir,” said he to Charvoz, “do you know these three signs?” “No,” replied the Abbe ingenuous ly; “but the prophet assures us that they are of the highest importance, and that"},{"pageNumber":435,"pageContent":"THE KE Y OF THE MYSTERIES 149 their hidden signification shall soon be made known, that is to say, at the end of the Age.” “Oh, well, sir,” solemnly replied the Professor of Magic; “even before the end of the Age, I will explain them to you; these three qabalistic signs are the signature of the devil!” “It is impossible!” cried the old priest. “It is the case,” replied Eliphas, with determination. Now, the signs were these: 1 °. — The star of the micrososm, or the magic pentagram. It is the five - pointed star of occult masonry, the star with which Agrippa drew the human figure, the head in the upper point, the four limbs in the four others. The flaming star, which, when turned upside down, is the hierolgyph ic sign of the goat of Black Magic, whose head may then be drawn in the star, the two horns at the top, the ears to the right and left, the beard at the bottom. It is the sign of antagonism and fatality. It is the goat of lust attacking the heavens with its horns. It is a sign execrated by initiates of a superior rank, even at the Sabbath. 1 2 °. — The two hermetic serpents. But the heads and tails, instead of coming together in two similar semicircles, were turned outwards, and there was no intermediate li ne repre - senting the caduceus. Above the head of the serpents, one saw the fatal V, the Typhonian fork, the character of hell. To the right and left, the sacred numbers III and VII were relegated to the horizontal line which represents passive and seconda ry things. The meaning of the character was then this: Antagonism is eternal. 1 But if this were on a circular host, how could it be upside down? — O.M."},{"pageNumber":436,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 150 God is the strife of fatal forces, which always create through destruction. The things of religion are passive and transitory. Boldness makes use of them, war profits by them, a nd it is by them that discord is perpetuated. 3 °. — Finally, the qabalistic monogram of Jehovah, the JOD and the HÉ, but upside down. This is, according to the doctors of occult science, the most frightful of all blasphemies, and signifies, however one may read it, “Fatality alone exists: God and the Spirit are not. Matter is all, and spirit is only a fiction of this matter demented. Form is more than idea, woman more than man, pleasure more than thought, vice more than virtue, the mob more than its chiefs , the children more than their fathers, folly more than reason!” There is what was written in characters of blood upon the pretended miraculous hosts of Vintras! We affirm upon our honour that the facts cited above are such as we have stated, and that we o urselves saw and explained the characters according to magical science and the true keys of the Qabalah. The disciple of Vintras also communicated to us the description and design of the pontifical vestments given, said he, by Jesus Christ Himself to the p retended prophet, during one of his ecstatic trances. Vintras had these vestments made, and clothes himself with them in order to perform his miracles. They are red in colour. He wears upon his forehead a cross in the form of a lingam; and his pastoral staff is surmounted by a hand, all of whose fingers are closed, except the thumb and the little finger. Now, all that is diabolical in the highest degree. And is"},{"pageNumber":437,"pageContent":"THE KE Y OF THE MYSTERIES 151 it not a really wonderful thing, this intuition of the signs of a lost science? For it is transcendental magic which, basing the universe upon the two columns of Hermes and of Solomon, has divided the metaphysical world into two intellectual zones, one white and luminous, enclosing positive ideas, the other black and obscure, containing neg ative ideas, and which has given to the synthesis of the first, the name of God, and to that of the other, the name of the devil or of Satan. The sign of the lingam borne upon the forehead is in India the distinguishing mark of the worshippers of Shiva the destroyer; for that sign being that of the great magical arcanum, which refers to the mystery of universal generation, to bear it on the forehead is to make profession of dogmatic shamelessness. “Now,” say the Orientals, “the day when there is no longer modesty in the world, the world, given over to debauch which is sterile, will end at once for lack of mothers. Modesty is the acceptance of maternity.” The hand with the three large fingers closed expresses the negation of the ternary, and the affirmation of the natural forces alone. The ancient hierophants, as our learned and witty friend Desbarolles is about to explain in an admirable book which is at present in the press, had given a complete résumé of magical science in the human hand. The forefinger , for them, represented Jupiter; the middle finger, Saturn; the ring - finger, Apollo or the Sun. Among the Egyptians, the middle finger was Ops, the forefinger Osiris, and the little finger Horus; the thumb represented the generative force,and the little finger, cunning.

It is the perverted and material translation of that great word of St. Augus tine: “Love, and do what you will!” Compare now this sign with the doctrine of Mr. Madrolle: The most imperfect and the most apparently guilty act of love is worth more than the best of prayers . And you will ask yourself what is that force which, indepen dently of the will, and of the greater or less knowledge of man (for Vintras is a man of no education), formulates its dogmas with signs buried in the rubbish of the ancient world, re - discovers the mysteries of Thebes and of Eleusis, and writes for us the most learned reveries of India with the occult alphabets of Hermes? What is that force? I will tell you. But I have still plenty of other miracles to tell; and this article is like a judicial investigation. We must, before anything else, complete it. However, we may be permitted, before proceeding to other accounts to transcribe here a page from a German illuminé , of the work of Ludwig Tieck: “If, for example, as an ancient tradition informs us, some of the angels whom God had created fell all too soo n, and if these, as they also say, were precisely the most brilliant of the angels, one may very well understand by this ‘fall’ that they sought a new road, a new form of activity, other occupations, and another life than those orthodox or more passive spi rits who remained in the realm assigned to them, and made no use of liberty, the appanage of all of them.

Is it not the very genius of ancient Prometheus , that force which sets in motion the world, life, even movement, and which regulates the course of successive forms? This force, by its resistance, equilibrated the creative principle. It is thus that the Elohim gave birth to the earth. When, subsequently, men were place d upon the earth by the Lord, as intermediate spirits, in their enthusiasm, which led them to search Nature in its depths, they gave themselves over to the influence of that proud and powerful genius, and when they were softly ravished away over the precip ice of death to find life, there it was that they began to exist in a real and natural manner, as is fit for all creatures.” This page needs no commentary, and explains sufficiently the tendencies of what one calls spiritualism, or spiritism . It is alread y a long time since this doctrine, or, rather, this antidoctrine, began to work upon the world, to plunge it into universal anarchy. But the law of equilibrium will save us, and already the great movement of reaction has begun. We continue the recital of the phenomena. One day a workman paid a visit to Eliphas Levi. He was a tall man of some fifty years old, of frank appearance, and speaking in a very reasonable manner. Questioned as to the motive of his visit, he replied: “You ought to know it well enou gh; I am come to beg and pray you to return to me what I have lost.” We must say, to be frank, that Eliphas knew nothing of"},{"pageNumber":440,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 154 this visitor, nor of what he might have lost.

It was the grimoire of Pope Honorius. One word upon this little book so much decried. The grimoire of Honorius is composed of an apocryphal constitution of Honorius II, for the evo cation and control of spirits; then of some superstitious receipts . . . it was the manual of the bad priests who practised Black Magic during the darkest periods of the middle ages. You will find there bloody rites, mingled with profanations of the Mass and of the consecrated elements, formulae of bewitchment and male - volent spells, and practices which stupidity alone could credit or knavery counsel. In fact, it is a book complete of its kind; it is consequently become very rare, and the bibliophile push es it to very high prices in the public sales. “My dear sir,” said the workman, sighing, “since I was ten years old, I have not missed once performing the orison. This book never leaves me, and I comply rigorously with all the prescribed ceremonies. Why , then, have those who used to visit me abandoned me?

I only know that among them the chiefs are good, the inter - mediate rank pa rtly good and partly evil; the inferiors bad, but blindly, and without its being possible for them to do better. He whom I evoked, and who has often appeared to me, belongs to the most elevated hierarchy; for he was good - looking, well dressed, and always gave me favourable answers. But I have lost a page of my grimoire , the first, the most important, that which bore the autograph of the spirit; and, since then, he no longer appears when I call him. “I am a lost man. I am naked as Job, I have no longer e ither force or courage. O Master, I conjure you, you who need only say one word, make one sign, and the spirits will obey, take pity upon me, and restore to me what I have lost!” “Give me your grimoire!” said Eliphas. “What name used you to give to the spirit who appeared to you?” “I called him Adonai.” “And in what language was his signature?” “I do not know, but I suppose it was in Hebrew.” “There,” said the Professor of Transcendental Magic, after having traced two words in the Hebrew language in the beginning and at the end of the book. “Here are two words which the spirits of darkness will never counterfeit.

Home: hands coming out of walls, movements of furniture, phosphorescent apparitions. One day, the rash apprentice - magician had dared to call up Astaroth, and had seen the apparition of a gigantic monster having the body of a hog, and the head borrowed fr om the skeleton of a colossal ox. But he told all that with an accent of truth, a certainty of having seen, which excluded every kind of doubt as to the good faith and the entire conviction of the narrator. Eliphas, who is an epicure in magic, was de lighted with this find. In the nineteenth century, a real sorcerer of the middle ages, a remarkably innocent and convinced sorcerer, a sorcerer who had seen Satan under the name of Adonai, Satan dressed like a respectable citizen, and Astaroth in his tr ue diabolical form! What a supreme find for a museum! What a treasure for an archaeologist! “My friend,” said he to his new disciple, “I am going to help you to find what you say you have lost.

In front of my bed I saw a bright light, and in this light a shadowy arm which passed and repassed before me, as if to magnetize me. Then I went to sleep again, and some instants afterwards, waking anew, I saw again the same light, but it had changed its place. It had passed from left to right, and upon a luminous background I distinguished the silhouette of a man who was looking at me with arms crossed.” “What was this man like?” “Just about your height and breadth.” “It is well. Go, and continue to do what I told you.” The nine days rolled by; at the end of that time, a new visit; but this time he was absolutely radiant and excited. As soon as he caught sight of Eliphas: “Thanks, Master!” he cried. \"The m achine works!

Some days afterwards, the Professor of Transcendental Magic was awakened, about two o'clock in the morning, by an acute pain in the head. For some moments he feared a cerebral congestion. He therefore rose, relit his lamp, opened his window, walked to and fro in his study, and then, calmed by the fresh air of the morning, he lay down again, and slept deeply. He had a nigh tmare: he saw, terribly real, the giant with the fleshless ox's head of which the workman had spoken to him. The monster pursued him, and struggled with him. When he woke up, it was already day, and somebody was knocking at his door. Eliphas rose, threw on a dressing - gown, and opened; it was the workman. “Master,” said he, entering hastily, and with an alarmed air; “how are you?” “Very well,” replied Eliphas. “But last night, at two o’clock in the morning, did you not run a great danger?” Eliphas did no t grasp the allusion; he already no longer remembered the indisposition of the night."},{"pageNumber":447,"pageContent":"THE KE Y OF THE MYSTERIES 161 “A danger?” said he. “No; none that I know of.” “Have you not been assaulted by a monster phantom, who sought to strangle you?

But how do you know that?” “At the same time, an invisible hand struck me roughly on the shoulder, and awoke me suddenly. I dreamt then that I saw you fighting with Astaroth. I jumped up, and a voice said in my ear: ‘Arise and go to the help of thy Master; he is in danger.’ I got up in a great hurry. But where must I run? What danger threatened you? Was it at your own house, or elsewhere? The voice said nothing about that. I decided to wait for sunrise; and immediately day dawned, I ran, and here I am.” “Thanks, friend,” said the magus, holding out his hand; “Astaroth is a stupid joker; all that happened last night was a little blood to the head. Now, I am perfectly well. Be assured, then, and return to your work.” Strange as may be the facts which we have just related, there remains for us to unveil a tragic drama much more extraordinary still. It refers to the deed of blood which at the beginnin g of this year plunged Paris and all Christendom into mourning and stupefaction; a deed in which no one suspected that Black Magic had any part.

Eliphas Levi did not feel himself immediately prepossessed with confidence towards the stranger, to the point of exposing h imself without precaution to his visits; he indicated the house of a friend, where he was to be in the company of his faithful disciple, Desbarrolles. At the hour and date appointed they went, in fact, to the house of Mme. A —— , and found that the ecclesia stic had been waiting for them for some moments. He was a young and slim man; he had an arched and pointed nose, with dull blue eyes. His bony and projecting forehead was rather broad than high, his head was dolicho - cephalic, his hair flat and short, part ed on one side, of a greyish blond with just a tinge of chestnut of a rather curious and disagreeable shade. His mouth was sensual and quarrel - some; his manners were affable, his voice soft, and his speech sometimes a little embarrassed. Questioned by El iphas Levi concerning the object of his visit, he replied that he was on the look - out for the grimoire of Honorius, and that he had come to learn from the Professor of Occult Science how to ob - tain that little black book, now - a - days almost impossible to fi nd. “I would gladly give a hundred francs for a copy of that grimoire,” said he. “The work in itself is valueless,” said Eliphas. “It is a pretended constitution of Honorius II, which you will find perhaps quoted by some erudite collector of apocryphal co nstitutions; you can find it in the library.” “I will do so, for I pass almost all my time in Paris in the public libraries.”"},{"pageNumber":449,"pageContent":"THE KE Y OF THE MYSTERIES 163 “You are not occupied in the ministry in Paris?” “No, not now; I was for some little while employed in the parish of St. Germain - A uxerrois.” “And you now spend your time, I understand, in curious researches in occult science.” “Not precisely, but I am seeking the realization of a thought. . . . I have something to do.” “I do not suppose that this something can be an operation of Blac k Magic. You know as well as I do, reverend sir, that the Church has always condemned, and still con - demns, severely, everything which relates to these forbidden practices.” A pale smile, imprinted with a sort of sarcastic irony, was all the answer that the Abbe gave, and the conversation fell to the ground. However, the cheiromancer Desbarrolles was attentively looking at the hand of the priest; he perceived it, a quite natural explanation followed, the Abbe offered graciously and of his own accord his h and to the experimenter. Desbarrolles knit his brows, and appeared embarrassed. The hand was damp and cold, the fingers smooth and spatulated; the mount of Venus, or the part of the palm of the hand which corresponds to the thumb, was of a noteworthy dev elopment, the line of life was short and broken, there were crosses in the centre of the hand, and stars upon the mount of the moon. “Reverend sir,” said Desbarrolles, “if you had not a very solid religious education you would easily become a dangerous sec tary, for you are led on the one hand toward the most exalted mysticism, and on the other to the most concentrated obstinacy combined with the greatest secretiveness that can"},{"pageNumber":450,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 164 possibly be.

He rose and took his leave without having given his name, and without any one having thought to ask him for it. Eliphas and Desbarrolles reconducted him as far as the staircase, in token of respect for his dignity as a priest. Near the staircase he turned and said slowly: “Before long, you will hear something. . . . You will hear me spoken of,” he added, emphasizing each word. Then he saluted with head and hand, turned without adding a single word, and descended the staircase. The two friends re turned to Mme.

In the course of the night between the 1 st and 2 nd of January, 1857 , Eliphas Levi was awakened suddenly by the emotions of a bizarre and dismal dream. It seemed to him that he was in a d ilapidated room of gothic architecture, rather like the abandoned chapel of an old castle. A door hidden by a black drapery opened on to this room; behind the drapery one guessed the hidden light of tapers, and it seemed to Eliphas that, driven by a curio sity full of terror, he was approaching the black drapery. . . . Then the drapery was parted, and a hand was stretched forth and seized the arm of Eliphas. He saw no one, but he heard a low voice which said in his ear: “Come and see your father, who is a bout to die.” The magus awoke, his heart palpitating, and his forehead bathed in sweat. “What can this dream mean?” thought he. “It is long since my father died; why am I told that he is going to die, and why has this warning upset me?” The following nigh t, the same dream recurred with the same circumstances; once more Eliphas awoke, hearing a voice in his ear repeat: “Come and see your father, who is about to die.” This repeated nightmare made a painful impression upon Eliphas: he had accepted, for the 3 r d January, an invitation to dinner in pleasant company, but he wrote and excused himself, feeling himself little inclined for the gaiety of a banquet of artists. He remained, then, in his study; the weather was cloudy; at midday he received a visit from o ne of his magical"},{"pageNumber":453,"pageContent":"THE KE Y OF THE MYSTERIES 167 pupils, Viscount M —— . When he left, the rain was falling in such abundance that Eliphas offered his umbrella to the Viscount, who refused it. There followed a contest of politeness, of which the result was that Eliphas went out to see t he Viscount home. While they were in the street, the rain stopped, the Viscount found a carriage, and Eliphas, instead of returning to his house, mechanically crossed the Luxembourg, went out by the gate which opens on the Rue d'Enfer, and found himself o pposite the Pantheon. A double row of booths, improvised for the Festival of St. Geneviève, indicated to pilgrims the road to St. Etienne - du - Mont. Eliphas, whose heart was sad, and consequently disposed to prayer, followed that way and entered the church. It might have been at that time about four o'clock in the afternoon. The church was full of the faithful, and the office was performed with great concentration, and extraordinary solemnity. The banners of the parishes of the city, and of the suburbs, b ore witness to the public veneration for the virgin who saved Paris from famine and invasion. At the bottom of the church, the tomb of St. Geneviève shone gloriously with light. They were chanting the litanies, and the procession was coming out of the ch oir. After the cross, accompanied by its acolytes, and followed by the choirboys, came the banner of St. Geneviève; then, walk - ing in double file, came the lady devotees of St. Geneviève, clothed in black, with a white veil on the head, a blue ribbon aroun d the neck, with the medal of the legend, a taper in the hand, surmounted by the little gothic lantern that tradition gives to the images of the saint.

After the lady devotees came the clergy; then finally appeared the venerable Archbishop of Paris, mitred with a white mitre, wearing a cope which was supported on each side by his two vicars; the prelate, leaning on his cross, walked slowly, and blessed to right and left the crowd which knelt about his path. Eliphas saw the Archb ishop for the first time, and noticed the features of his countenance. They expressed kindliness and gentleness; but one might observe the expression of a great fatigue, and even of a nervous suffer - ing painfully dissimulated. The procession descended to the foot of the church, tra - versing the nave, went up again by the aisle at the left of the door, and came to the station of the tomb of St. Genèvieve; then it returned by the right - hand aisle, chanting the litanies as it went. A group of the faithful fo llowed the procession, and walked immediately behind the Archbishop. Eliphas mingled in this group, in order more easily to get through the crowd which was about to reform, so that he might regain the door of the church. He was lost in reverie, softened b y this pious solemnity. The head of the procession had already returned to the choir, the Archbishop was arriving at the railing of the nave: there the passage was too narrow for three people to walk in file; the Archbishop was in front, and the two grand - vicars behind him, always holding the edges of his cope, which was"},{"pageNumber":455,"pageContent":"THE KE Y OF THE MYSTERIES 169 thus thrown off, and drawn backwards, in such a manner that the prelate presented his breast uncovered, and protected only the by crossed embroideries of his stole. Then those who were behi nd the Archbishop saw him tremble, and we heard an interruption in a loud and clear voice; but without shouting, or clamour. What had been said? It seemed that it was: “Down with the goddesses!” But I thought I had not heard aright, so out of place an d void of sense it seemed. However, the exclamation was repeated twice or thrice; then some one cried: “Save the Archbishop!” Other voices replied: “To arms!” The crowd, overturning the chairs and the barriers, scattered, and rushed towards the doors s hrieking. Amidst the wails of the children, and the screams of the women, Eliphas, carried away by the crowd, found himself somehow or other out of the church; but the last look that he was able to cast upon it was smitten with a terrible and ineffaceable picture! In the midst of a circle made large by the affright of all those who surrounded him, the prelate was standing alone, leaning always on his cross, and held up by the stiffness of his cope, which the grand - vicars had let go, and which accordingly h ung down to the ground. The head of the Archbishop was a little thrown back, his eyes and his free hand raised to heaven. His attitude was that which Eugène Delacroix has given to the Bishop of Liege in the picture of his assassination by the bandits of t he Wild Boar of the Ardennes; 1 there was in his gesture the whole 1 Extract from Sir Walter Scott’s Notes on the murder of the Bishop of Liège: “The Bishop ’s murder did not take place till 1482 .

The day was falling, and the church was beginning to grow dark. The Archb ishop, his arms raised to heaven, lighted by a last ray which penetrated the casements of the nave, stood out upon a dark background, where one could scarcely distinguish a pedestal without a statue, on which were written these two words of the Passion of Christ: E CCE H OMO ! and farther in the background, an apocalyptic painting representing the four plagues ready to let themselves loose upon the world, and the whirlwinds of hell, following the dusty traces of the pale horse of death. Before the Archbishop, a lifted arm, sketched in shadow like an infernal silhouette, held and brandished a knife. Policemen, sword in hand, were running up. And while all this tumult was going on at the bottom of the church, the singing of the litanies continued in the choir, the Ardennes,’ entered into a conspiracy with the discontented citizens of Liège against their Bishop, Louis of Bou rbon, being aided with considerable sums of money by the King of France. By this means and with the assistance of many murderers and banditti, who thronged to him as a leader befitting them, De la Marck assembled a body of troops. With this little army he approached the city of Liège. Upon this, the citizens, who were engaged in the conspiracy, came to their bishop, and, offering to stand by him to the death, exhorted him to march out against these robbers. The Bishop, therefore, put himself at the h ead of a few troops of his own, trusting to the assistance of the people of Liège. But as soon as they came in sight of the enemy, the citizens, as before agreed, fled from the Bishop’s banner, and he was left with his own handful of adherents . At this moment De la Marck charged at the head of his men with the expected success. The Bishop was brought before De la Marck, who first cut him over the face, thenmurdered him with his own heand, and caused his body to be exposed naked in the great square of L iège before St. Lambert’s Cathedral.” Three years after the Bishop’s death, Maximilian, Emperor of Austria, caused De la Marck to be arrested at Utrecht, where he was beheaded in 1485 ."},{"pageNumber":457,"pageContent":"THE KE Y OF THE MYSTERIES 171 as the harmony of the orbs of heaven goes on for ever, careless of our revolutions and of our anguish.

This group was whirling around a man whom fifty arms seemed to hold, whom a hundred shaken fists sought to strike.

But the description which the public sheets gave of the criminal disagreed with the recollection of the Professor of Magic.

For this is in what the infernal evocations consist, according to the grimoire of Honorius: “Choose a black cock, and give him the name of the spirit of darkness which one wishe s to evoke. “Kill the cock, and keep its heart, its tongue, and the first feather of its left wing. “Dry the tongue and the heart, and reduce them to powder. “Eat no meat and drink no wine, that day. “On Tuesday, at dawn, say a mass of the angels. “Trace u pon the altar itself, with the feather of the cock dipped in the consecrated wine, certain diabolical signatures (those of Mr. Home's pencil, and the bloody hosts of Vintras). “On Wednesday, prepare a taper of yellow wax; rise at midnight, and alone, in t he church, begin the office of the dead. “Mingle with this office infernal evocations. “Finish the office by the light of a single taper, extinguish it immediately, and remain without light in the church thus profaned until sunrise. “On Thursday, mingle wi th the consecrated water the powder of the tongue and heart of the black cock, and let the whole be swallowed by a male lamb of nine days old. . . .”"},{"pageNumber":463,"pageContent":"THE KE Y OF THE MYSTERIES 177 The hand refuses to write the rest.

Let us now investigate the allegories of Genesis. “In the beginning ( IOD the unity of being,) El ohim, the equilibrated forces (Jakin and Boaz), created the heaven (spirit) and the earth (matter), or in other words, good and evil, affirmation and negation.” Thus begins the Mosaic account of creation. Then, when it comes to giving a place to man, and a sanctuary to his alliance with divinity, Moses speaks of a garden, in the midst of which a single fountain branched into four rivers (the IOD and the TETRAGRAM ), and then of two trees, one of life, and the other of death, planted near the river.

They are then driven out from the sanctuary of truth, and a kerub (a bull - headed sphinx, vide the hieroglyphs of Assyria, of India and of Egypt) is placed at the gate of the garden of truth in order to prevent the profane from destroying the tree of life. Here we have mysterious dogma, with all its allegories and its terrors, replacing the simplicity of truth. The idol has replaced God, and fallen humanity will not delay to give itself up to the worship of the golden calf. The mystery of the necessary and successive reactions of the two principles on each other is indicated subsequently by the allegory of Cain and Abel. For ce avenges itself by oppression for the seduction of weakness; martyred weakness expiates and intercedes for force when it is condemned for its crime to branding remorse. Thus is revealed the equilibrium of the moral world; here is the basis of all the pr ophecies, and the fulcrum of all intelligent political thought. To abandon a force to its own excesses is to condemn it to suicide. Dupuis failed to understand the universal religious dogma of the Qabalah, because he had not the science of the beautiful h ypothesis, partly demonstrated and realized more from day to day by the discoveries of science: I refer to universal analogy . Deprived of this key of transcendental dogma, he could see no more of the gods than the sun, the seven planets, and the twelve sig ns of the zodiac; but he did not see in the sun the image of the Logos of Plato, in the seven planets the seven notes of the celestial gamut, and in the zodiac the quadrature of the ternary circle of all initiations."},{"pageNumber":474,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 188 The Emperor Julian, that adept of the s pirit who was never understood, that initiate whose paganism was less idolatrous than the faith of certain Christians, the Emperor Julian, we say, understood better than Dupuis and Volney the symbolic worship of the sun. In his hymn to the king, Helios, he recognizes that the star of day is but the reflection and the material shadow of that sun of truth which illumines the world of intelligence, and which is itself only a light borrowed from the Absolute. It is a remarkable thing that Julian has ideas of the Supreme God, that the Christians thought they alone adored, much greater and more correct than those of some of the fathers of the Church, who were his contemporaries, and his adversaries. This is how he expresses himself in his defence of Hellenism: “It is not sufficient to write in a book that God spake, and things were made. It is necessary to examine whether the things that one attributes to God are not contrary to the very laws of Being. For, if it is so, God could not have made them, for He could not contradict Nature with - out denying Himself. . . .

Minerals, vegetables, animals were studied analogically; and they attributed their origin and their properties to the passive or to the active principle, to the darkness or to the light. The sign of thei r election or of their reprobation, traced in their natural form, became the hieroglyphic character of a vice or a virtue; then, by dint of taking the sign for the thing, and expressing the thing by the sign, they ended by confounding them.

The thing is the virtue of the sign. There is an analogical correspondence between the sign and the thing signified. The more perfect is the sign, the more entire is the correspondence. To say a word is to evoke a thought and make it present. To name God is to manifest God. The word acts upon souls, and souls react upon bodies; consequently one can frighten, console, cause to fall ill, cure, even kill, and raise from the dead by means of words. To utter a name is to create or evoke a being. In the name is contained the verbal or spiritual doctrine of the being itself. When the soul evokes a thought, the sign of that thought is written automatically in th e light. To invoke is to adjure, that is to say, to swear by a name; it is to perform an act of faith in that name, and to communicate in the virtue which it represents.

From these principles, some true, others hypothetical, and from the more or less exaggerated consequences that they draw from them, there resulted for superstitious qabalists and absolute confidence in enchantments, evocations, conjurations and mysterious prayers. Now, as faith has always accom - plished miracles, apparitions, oracles, mysterious cures, sudden and strange mal adies, have never been lacking to it. It is thus that a simple and sublime philosophy has become the secret science of Black Magic.

However, as we have just explained, that is not the true science. Men rarely seek the truth from its own sake; they have always a secret motive in their efforts, some passion to satisfy, or some greed to assuage. Among the secrets of the Qabalah there is one above all which has always tormented seekers; it is the secret of the transmutation of metals, and of the conversion of all earthly substances into gold.

Jerome Cardan was acquainted with the symbolical alphabet of the initiates, as one may recognize by the number and dispo sition of the chapters of his work on Subtlety.

The tradition of this secret has, then, never been interrupted from the first ages of the Qabalah to our own times. The table - turners, a nd those who make the spirits speak with alphabetical charts, are, then, a good many centuries behind the times; they do not know that there exists an oracular instrument whose words are always clear and always accurate, by means of which one can communica te with the seven genii of the planets, and make to speak at will the seventy - two wheels of Assiah, of Yetzirah, and of Briah. For that purpose it is sufficient to understand the system of universal analogies, such as Swedenborg has set it forth in the h ieroglyphic key of the arcana; then to mix the cards together, and draw from them by chance, always grouping them by the numbers corresponding to the ideas on which one desires enlightenment; then, reading the oracles as qabalistic writings ought to be rea d, that is to say, beginning in the middle and going from right to left for odd numbers, beginning on the right for even numbers, and interpreting successively the number for the letter which corresponds to it, the grouping of the letters by the addition o f their numbers, and all the successive oracles by their numerical order, and their hieroglyphic relations.

In old times, chess - players sought upon the ir chess - board the solution of philosophical and religious problems, and argued silently with each other in manoeuvring the hieroglyphic characters across the numbers. Our vulgar game of goose, revived from the old Grecian game, and also attributed to Pa lamedes, is nothing but a chess - board with motionless figures and numbers movable by means of dice. It is a Tarot disposed in the form of a wheel, for the use of aspirants to initiation.

One of the first results of this discovery should be to give a new direction to the study of the hieroglyphi c writings as yet so imperfectly deciphered by the rivals and successors of M.

The obelisk of Luxor, for example, was it not one of the two columns a t the entrance of a temple? Was it at the right - hand or the left - hand pillar?

If it were, for example, the universal primitive language? Now, this language, which was that of the transcendental Qabalah, did certainly exist; more, it still exists at the base of Hebrew it self, and of all the oriental languages which derive from it; this language is that of the sanctuary, and the columns at the entrance of the temples ordinarily contained all its symbols. The intuition of the ecstatics comes nearer to the truth with rega rd to these primitive signs that even the science of the learned, because, as we have said, the universal vital fluid, the astral light, being the mediating principle between the ideas and the forms, is obedient to the extraordinary leaps of the soul whi ch seeks the unknown, and furnishes it naturally with the signs already found, but forgotten, of the great revelations of occultism.

It is in light that form is preserved. It is by light that form reproduces itself. The vibrations of light are the principle of universal movement. By light, the suns are attached to each other, and they inter lace their rays like chains of electricity. Men and things are magnetized by light like the suns, and, by means of electro - magnetic chains whose tension is caused by sympathies and affinities, are able to communicate with each other from one end of the wor ld to the other, to caress or strike, wound or heal, in a manner doubtless natural, but invisible, and of the nature of prodigy. There is the secret of magic. Magic, that science which comes to us from the magi! Magic, the first of sciences! Magic, the hol iest science, because it establishes in the sublimest manner the great religious truths! Magic, the most calumniated of all, because the vulgar obstinately confound magic with the superstitious sorcery whose abominable practices we have denounced!

The Bible tells us that Jannes and Jambres, Pharaoh's magicians, at first performed the same miracles as Moses, and that they declared th ose which they could not imitate im - possible to human science. It is in fact more flattering to the self - love of a charlatan to deem that a miracle has taken place, than to declare himself conquered by the science or skill of a fellow - magician — above all, when he is a political enemy or a religious adversary. When does the possible in magical miracles begin and end? Here is a serious and important question. What is certain is the existence of the facts which one habitually describes as miracles. Magnetiz ers and sleep - wakers do them every day; Sister Rose Tamisier did them; the “illuminated” Vintras does them still; more than fifteen thousand witnesses recently attested those of the American mediums; ten thousand peasants of Berry and Sologne would attest , if need were, those of the god Cheneau (a retired button - merchant who believes himself inspired by God). Are all these people hallucinated or knaves? Hallucinated, yes, perhaps, but the very fact that their halluci - nation is identical, whether separatel y or collectively, is it not a sufficiently great miracle on the part of him who produces it, always, at will, and at a stated time and place? To do miracles, and to persuade the multitude that one does them, are very nearly the same thing, above all in a century as frivolous and scoffing as ours.

The science of miracles is then the knowledge of this marvellous force, and the art of doing miracles is simply the art of magnetizing or illuminat - ing beings, according to the invariable laws of magnetism or astral light. We prefer the word “light” to the word “magnetism,” because it is more traditional in occultism, and expresses in a more complete and perfect manner the nature of the s ecret agent. There is, in truth, the liquid and drinkable gold of the masters in alchemy; the word “ OR ” (the French word for “gold”) comes from the Hebrew “ AOUR ” which signifies “light.” “What do you wish?” they asked the candidate in every initiation: “ To see the light,” should be their answer. The name of illuminati which one ordinarily gives to adepts, has then been generally very badly interpreted by giving to it a mystical sense, as if it signified men whose intelligence believes itself to be lighte d by a miraculous day. ‘Illuminati’ means simply, knowers and possessors of the light, either by the knowledge of the great magical agent, or by the rational and ontological notion of the absolute. The universal agent is a force tractable and subordinate to intelligence. Abandoned to itself, it, like Moloch, devours rapidly all that to which it gives birth, and changes the superabundance of life into immense destruction.

Thus also it is said in the Zohar that at the begi nning of our earthly period, when the elements disputed among themselves the surface of the earth, that fire, like an immense serpent, had enveloped everything in its coils, and was about to consume all beings, when divine clemency, raising around it the w aves of the sea like a vestment of clouds, put her foot upon the head of the serpent and made him re - enter the abyss. Who does not see in this allegory the first idea, and the most reasonable explanation, of one of the images dearest to Catholic symbolism , the triumph of the Mother of God? The qabalists say that the occult name of the devil, his true name, is that of Jehovah written backwards. This, for the initiate, is a complete revelation of the mysteries of the tetragram. In fact, the order of the l etters of that great name indicates the predominance of the idea over form, of the active over the passive, of cause over effect. By reversion that order one obtains the contrary. Jehovah is he who tames Nature as it were a superb horse and makes it go w here he will; Chavajoh (the demon) is the horse without a bridle who, like those of the Egyptians of the song of Moses, falls upon its rider, and hurls him beneath it, into the abyss. The devil, then, exists really enough for the qabalists; but it is neith er a person nor a distinguished power of even the forces of Nature.

At this word, the vulgar hastened to cross themselves, and to hide their eyes, but the initiates of the cult of Hermes - Pantheos understood the allegory, and were very careful not to explain it to the profane. Mr. de Mirville, in a book to - day almost forgotten, though it made some noise a few months ago, gives himself a great d eal of trouble to compile an account of various sorceries, of the kind which fill the compilations of people like Delancre, Delrio, and Bodin.

Callot alone, initiated by the wandering Bohemians during his infancy into the mysteries of black sorcery, was able to understand and reproduce the evocations of the first hermit. And do you think that in r etracing those frightful dreams of maceration and fasting, the makers of legends have invented? No; they have remained far below the truth. The cloisters, in fact, have always been peopled with nameless spectres, and their walls have palpitated with shad ows and infernal larvae. St. Catherine of Siena on one occasion passed a week in the midst of an obscene orgy which would have discouraged the lust of Pietro di Aretino; St. Theresa felt her - self carried away living into hell, and there suffered, between walls which ever closed upon her, tortures which only hysteri - cal women will be able to understand. . . .

But man never conceives absolute evil, save as a false idea of good. Good only can be absolute; and evil is only relative to our ignorance, and to our errors.

A wicked man will always find one more wicked than himself to do him harm; and when the e vil is at its climax, it must cease, for it could only continue by the annihi - lation of being, which is impossible. Then the man - devils, at the end of their resources, fall once more under the empire of the god - men, and are saved by those whom one at firs t thought their victims; but the man who strives to live a life of evil deeds, does homage to good by all the intelligence and energy that he develops in himself. For this reason the great initiator said in his figurative language: “I would that thou wert cold or hot; but because thou art lukewarm, I will spew thee out of my mouth.” The Great Master, in one of his parables, condemns only the idle man who buried his treasure from fear of losing it in the risky operations of that bank which we call life. To think nothing, to love nothing, to wish for nothing, to do nothing — that is the real sin. Nature only recognizes and rewards workers.

The hand is the instrument of action in man: it is, like the face, a sort of synthesis of the nervous s ystem, and should also have features and physiognomy. The character of the individual is traced there by undeniable signs. Thus, among hands, some are laborious, some are idle, some square and heavy, others insinuating and light. Hard and dry hands are made for strife and toil, soft and damp hands ask only for pleasure. Pointed fingers are inquisitive and mystical, square fingers mathematical, spatulated fingers obstinate and ambitious. The thumb, pollex, the finger of force and power, corresponds in th e qabalistic symbolism to the first letter of the name of Jehovah. This finger is then a synthesis of the hand: if it is strong, the man is morally strong; if it is weak, the man is weak. It has three phalanges, of which the first is hidden in the palm o f the hand, as the imaginary axis of the world traverses the thickness of the earth. This first phalanx corresponds to the physical life, the second to the intelligence, the third to the will. Greasy and thick palms denote sensual tastes and great force of physical life; a thumb which is long, especially in its last phalanx, reveals a strong will, which may go as far as despotism; short thumbs, on the contrary, show characters gentle and easily controlled. The habitual folds of the hand determine its line s. These lines are, then, the traces of habits, and the patient observer will know how to recognize them and how to judge them.

The hand has seven protuberances which the qabalists, following natural analogies, have attributed to the seven planets : that of the thumb, to Venus; that of the index to Jupiter; that of the medius, to Saturn; that of the ring - finger to the Sun; that of the little finger, to Mercury; the two others to Mars and to the Moon. According to their form and their predominance, they judged the inclinations, the aptitudes, and consequently the probable destinies of the individuals who submitted themselves to their judgment.

One will understand that such a science is already a power indeed sacerdotal and royal.

Previous to all great events, there have been most astonishing predictions. In the reign of Louis Philippe we heard sleep - walkers and ecstatics announce the return of the Empire, and specify the date of its coming. The Republic of 1848 was clearly announced in the prophecy of Orval, which dated at least from 1830 and which we strongly suspect to be, like those works attributed to the brothers Olivarius, the posthumous work of Mlle.

But what our learned friend and collaborator studies only as a philosophical curiosity, Paracelsus and his followers practised without being very anxious that the world should understand it; for it was for them one of those traditional secrets with regard to which silence is necessary, and which it is sufficient to in dicate to those who know, leaving always a veil upon the truth for the ignorant.

There are, then, in man, two lives: the individual or reasona ble life, and the common or instinctive life. It is by this latter that one can live in the bodies of others, since the universal soul, of which each nervous organism has a separate consciousness, is the same for all. We live in a common and universal lif e in the embryonic state, in ecstasy, and in sleep. In sleep, in fact, reason does not act, and logic, when it mingles in our dreams, only does so by chance, in accordance with the accidents of purely physical reminiscences. In dreams, we have the consci ousness of the universal life; we mingle ourselves with water, fire, air, and earth; we fly like birds; we climb like squirrels; we crawl like serpents; we are intoxicated with astral light; we plunge into the common reservoir, as happens in a more compl ete manner in death; but then (and it is thus that Paracelsus explains the mysteries of the other life) the wicked, that is to say, those who have allowed themselves to be dominated by the instinct of the brute to the prejudice of human reason, are drow ned in the ocean of the common life with all the anguish of eternal death; the others swim upon it, and enjoy for ever the riches of that fluid gold which they have succeeded in dominating.

Jesus expressed the same thought when he said to the daughter of Jairus: “The maiden is not dead, but sleepeth”; and of Lazarus: “Our friend is fallen asleep, a nd I go to wake him.” To express this resurrection - ist system in such a manner as not to offend common sense, by which we mean generally - held opinions, let us say that death, when there is no destruction or essential alteration of the physical organs, is always preceded by a lethargy of varying duration.

The thirty - two paths are the ten numbers and the twenty - two hieroglyphic letters of the Qabalah. The thirty - first refers to c , which represents the magic lamp, or the light between the horns of Baphomet.

The universal light, when it magnetizes the worlds, is called astral light; when it forms the metals, one calls it azoth, or philosophical mercury; when it gives life to animals, it should be called animal magnetism. The brute is subject to the fatalities of this light; man is able to direct it. It is the inte lligence which, by adapting the sign to the thought, creates forms and images. The universal light is like the divine imagination, and this world, which changes ceaselessly, yet ever remaining the same with regard to the laws of its configuration, is the v ast dream of God.

The soul of a dead man would, then, not be able to live in the atmosphere of the living, any more than we can live in earth or in water. For an airy, or rather an ethereal, spirit, it would be necessary to have an artificial body similar to th e apparatus of our divers, in order that it might come to us. All that we can see of the dead are the reflections which they have left in the atmospheric light, light whose imprints we evoke by the sympathy of our memories. The souls of the dead are above our atmosphere. Our respirable air becomes earth for them. This is what the Saviour declares in His Gospel, when He makes the soul of a saint say: “Now the great abyss is established between us, and those who are above can no longer descend to those wh o are below.” The hands which Mr. Home causes to appear are, then, composed of air coloured by the reflection which his sick imagination attracts and projects. 1 1 “The luminous agent being also that of heat, one understands the sudden variations of temperature occasioned by the abnormal projections or sudden absorptions of the light.

It is that all those who suffer from luminous congestion or contagious somnambulism, perish by a violent or, at least, a sudden death. It is for this reason that one used to attribute to the devil the power of strangling sorcerers. The excellent and worthy Lavater habitually evoked the alleged spirit of Gablidone. He was assassinated. A lemonade - seller of Leipzig, Schroepfer, evoked the animated images of the dead. He blew out his brains with a pistol. One knows what was the unhappy end of Cagliostro.

Religious feeling transforms itself into superstition when faith is lost; for souls need to believe, becau se they thirst for hope. How can faith be lost? How can science doubt the infinite harmony? Because the sanctuary of the absolute is always closed for the majority. But the kingdom of truth, which is that of God, suffers violence, and the violent must take it by force.

They were fluidic coagulations which one could destroy by dividing them. There were a sort of animated mirages, imperfect emana - tions of human life.

Persons who are obsessed by phantoms are usually exalted by too rigorous celibacy, or weakened by excesses. Fluidic phantoms are the abortions of the vital light; they are plastic media without body and without spirit, born from the excesses of the spirit and the disorders of the body. These wandering media may be attracted by certain degenerates who are fatally sympathetic to them, and who lend them at their own cost a fact itious existence of a more or less durable kind. They then serve as supplementary instruments to the instinctive volitions of these degenerates: never to cure them, always to send them farther astray, and to hallucinate them more and more. If corporeal em bryos can take the forms which the imagination of their mothers gives them, the wandering fluidic embryos ought to be prodigiously variable, and to transform themselves with an astonishing facility. Their tendency to give themselves a body in order to att ract a soul, makes them condense and assimilate naturally the corporeal molecules which float in the atmosphere. Thus, by coagulating the vapour of blood, they remake blood, that blood which hallucinated maniacs see floating upon pictures or statues. But they are not the only ones to see it. Vintras and Rose Tamisier are neither impostors nor myopics; the blood really flows; doctors examine it, analyse it; it is blood, real human blood: whence comes it?

The serum has again become liquid; it has taken up and imbibed anew the globules which the astral light has coloured, and the blood flows . Photography proves to us sufficiently that images are real modifications of light. Now, there exists an accidental and fortuitous photography which makes durable impression of mirages wandering in the atmosphere, upon leaves of trees, in wood, and even in the heart of stones: thus are formed those natural figures to which Gaffarel has consecrated several pages in his book of Curiosités inouies , those stones to which he attributes an occult virtue, which he calls gamahés; thus are traced those writings and drawings which so greatly astonish the observers of fluidic phenomena. They are astral photographs traced by the imagination of the mediums with or without the assistance of the fluidic larvae. The existence of these larvae has been demonstrated to us in a preemptory manner by a rather curious experience. Several persons, in order to test the magic power of the American Home, asked him to summon up relations which they pretended they had lost, but, who, in reality, had never existed.

That the dead may return, it is above all necessary that they should have existed, and demons would not so easily be the dupes of our mystifications. Like all Catholics, we believe in the existence of spirits of darkness, but we know also that the divine power has given them the darkness for an eternal prison, and that the Redeemer saw Satan fall from heaven like lightning. If the demons tempt us, it is by the voluntary complicity of our passions, and it is n ot permitted to them to make head against the empire of God, and by stupid and useless mani - festations to disturb the eternal order of Nature. The diabolical signatures and characters, which are produced without the knowledge of the medium, are evidently not proofs of a tacit or formal pact between these degenerates and intelligences of the abyss. These signs have served from the beginning to express astral vertigo, and remain in a state of mirage in the reflections of the divulged light. Nature also ha s its recollections, and sends to us the same signs to correspond to the same ideas. In all this, there is nothing either supernatural or infernal. “How! do you want me to admit,” said to us the Curé Charvoz, the first vicar of Vintras, “that Satan dares t o impress his hideous stigmata upon consecrated materials, which have become the actual body of Jesus Christ?” We declared immediately, that it was equally impossible for us to pronounce in favour of such a blasphemy; and yet, as we demonstrated in our ar ticles in the Estafette , the signs printed in bleeding characters upon the hosts of Vintras, regularly consecrated by Charvoz, were those which, in"},{"pageNumber":516,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 230 Black Magic, are absolutely recognized for the signatures of demons.

The drawings which pencils will trace if left to their own devices very often reproduce shapeless phalli, such as the anaemic hooligan, as one might picturesquely call him, sketches on the hoardings as he whistles, a further proof of our hypothesis, that wit in no way presides at those mani - festations, and that it would be above all sovereignly absurd to recognize in them the intervention of spirits released from the bondage of matter. The Jesuit, Paul Saufidius, who has written on the manners and customs of the Japanese, tells us a very remark - able s tory.

These spectres, at first without shape, and like la rvae, took on as they approached all the appearance of the human body. Soon they met the pilgrims, and mingled with them, gliding silently between their ranks. Then the Japanese saw themselves double, each phantom having become the perfect image and, as it were, the mirage of each pilgrim.

This phenomenon, whose truth we do not doubt, presents the double characters of a mirage, and of a sudden projection of astral larvae, occasioned by the heat of the atmosphere, and the fana tical exhaustion of the pilgrims. Dr. Brierre de Boismont, in his curious treatise, Traité des hallucinations , tells us that a man, perfectly sane, who had never had visions, was tormented one morning by a terrible nightmare: he saw in his room a mysterio us ape horrible to behold, who gnashed his teeth upon him, and gave himself over to the most hideous contortions. He woke with a start, it was already day; he jumped from his bed, and was frozen with terror on seeing, really present, the frightful object of his dream. The monkey was there, the exact image of the monkey of the nightmare, equally absurd, equally terrible, even making the same grimaces. He could not believe his eyes; he remained nearly half an hour motionless, observing this singular phenom enon, and asking himself whether he was delirious or mad. Ultimately, he approached the phantasm to touch it, and it vanished. Cornelius Gemma, in his Histore critique universelle , says that in the year 454 , in the island of Candia, the phantom of Moses appeared to some Jews on the sea - side; on his forehead he had luminous horns, in his hand was his blasting rod; and he invited them to follow him, showing them with his finger the horizon in the direction of the Holy Land. The news of this prodigy sprea d abroad, and the Israelites rushed towards the shore in a mob.

A shocking disaster resulted: almost all that multitude was drowned, and the hallucination was only extinguished with the life of the greater number of those unhappy visionaries.

She is more gracious than grace, her acts are easy and inimitable, like fine music and poetry. It is of her that a charming woman, too friendly to be her rival, said after a ball: “I thought I saw the Holy Bible frolicking.” Now look upon the other side of the sheet! See this other woman who affects the most rigid devotion, and would be scandalized if she heard the angels sing; but her talk is malevolent, her glance haughty and contemptuous; when she speaks of virtue she makes vice lovable. For her God is a jealous husband, and she makes a great merit of not deceiving him. Her maxims are desolating, her actions due to vanity more than to charity, and one might say after having met her at church: “I have seen the devil at prayer.” On leaving the first, one feels one's self full of love for all that is beautiful, good and generous. One is happy to have well said to her all the noble thi ngs with which she has inspired you, and to have been approved by her. One says to one’s self that life is good, since God has bestowed it on such souls as hers; one is full of courage and of hope. The other leaves you weakened and baffled, or perhaps, what is worse, full of evil designs; she makes you doubt of honour, piety and duty; in her presence one only escapes from weariness by the door of evil desires.

You admit sorrowfully that your child limps; in friendly fashion, they bid you remark that he is a hunchback. If he coughs and that alarms you, they conjure you tenderly to take great care of him, perhaps he is consumptive. Has you wife been ill for a long time? Cheer up, she will die of it!

One admires probity, said Juvenal, and one leaves it to freeze to death. If such and such a celebrated man, for exampl e, had not scandalously solicited wealth, would one ever have thought of endowing his old muse? Who would have left him legacies? Virtue has our admiration, our purse owes it nothing, that great lady is rich enough without us. One would rather give to vi ce, it is so poor! “I do not like beggars, and I only give to the poor who are ashamed to beg,” said one day a man of wit. “But what do you give them since you do not know them?” “I give them my admiration and my esteem, and I have no need to know the m to do that.” “How is it that you need so much money?” they asked another, “you have no children and no calls on you.” “I have my poor folk, and I cannot prevent myself from giving them a great deal of money.” “Make me acquainted with them, perhaps I w ill give them something too.” “Oh! you know some of them already, I have no doubt.

It was that same Cartouche who offered, on another occasion, of his own accord and without it being asked of him, twenty thousand pounds to a bankrupt. One must act properly to one's brothers.

The avowed accomplices of our passions may disgust us by humiliating us; at our own risk and peril our pride will teach us how to resist them. But what is more dangerous for us tha n our hypocritical and hidden accomplices? They follow us like sorrow, await us like the abyss, surround us like infatuation. We excuse them in order to excuse ourselves, defending them in order to defend ourselves, justifying them in order to justify our selves, and we submit to them finally because we must, because we have not the strength to resist our inclinations, because we lack the will to do so. They have possessed themselves of our ascendant, as Paracelsus says, and where they wish to lead us we sh all go. They are our bad angels. We know it in the depths of our consciousness; but we put up with them, we have made ourselves their servants that they also may be ours. Our passions treated tenderly and flattered, have become slave - mistresses; and those who serve our passions our valets, and our masters. We breathe out our thoughts and breathe in those of others imprinted in the astral light which has become their electro - magnetic atmosphere: and thus the companionship of the wicked is less fatal to the good than that of vulgar, cowardly, and tepid beings.

An honest woman will experience nothing but disgust in the society of a prostitute, but she has everything to fear from the seductions of a coquette. One knows that madness is contagious, but the mad are more particularly dangerous when they are amiable and sympathetic. One enters little by little into their circle of ideas, one ends by understanding their exaggerations, while partaking their enthusiasm, one grows accustomed to their logic that has lost its way, one ends by finding that they are not as mad as one thought at f irst. Thence to believing that they alone are right there is but one step. One likes them, one approves of them, one is as mad as they are. The affections are free and may be based on reason, but sympathies are of fatalism, and very frequently unreasonab le. They depend on the more or less balanced attractions of the magnetic light, and act on men in the same way as upon animals. One will stupidly take pleasure in the society of a person in whom is nothing lovable, because one is mysteriously attracted a nd dominated by him. And often enough, these strange sympathies began by lively antipathies; the fluids repelled each other at first, and subsequently became balanced. The equilibrating speciality of the plastic medium of every person is what Paracelsus calls his ascendant , and he gives the name of flagum to the particular reflection of the habitual ideas of each one in the universal light.

The astral ascendant has been divined by other magi, who gave i t the name of tourbillon (vortex). It is, say they, a current of specialized light, representing always the same circle of images, and consequently determined and determining impressions. These vortices exist for men as for stars. “The stars,” said Parac elsus, “breathe out their luminous soul, and attract each other's radiation. The soul of the earth, prisoner of the fatal laws of gravitation, frees itself by specializing itself, and passes through the instinct of animals to arrive at the intelligence of man. The active portion of this will is dumb, but it preserves in writing the secrets of Nature. The free part can no longer read this fatal writing without instantaneously losing its liberty. One does not pass from dumb and vegetative contemplation to free vibrating thought without changing one's surroundings and one's organs. Thence comes the forgetfulness which accompanies birth, and the vague reminiscences of our sickly intuitions, always analogous to the visions of our ecstasies and of our dreams.” This revelation of that great master of occult medicine throws a fierce light on all the phenomena of somnambulism and of divination. There also, for whoever knows how to find it, is the true key of evocation, and of communication with the fluidic soul o f the earth.

Thus are explained the bewitchments which are habitually made by shepherds, and the still quite recent phenomena of the Presbytery of Cideville. Cideville is a little village of Normandy, where a few years ago were produced phenomena like those which have since occurred under the influence of Mr. Home. M. de Mirville has studied them carefully, and M. Gougenet Des - mousseaux has reprinted all the details in a book, published in 1854 , entitled \" Mœurs et pratiques des démons . The most remarkable thing in this latter author is that he seems to divine the existence of the plastic medium or the fluidic body. “We have certainly not two souls,” said he, “but perhaps we have two bodies.” Everything that he says, in fact, would seem to prove this hypothesis. He saw a shepherd whose fluidic form haunted a Presbytery, and who was wounded at a distance by blows inflicted on his astral larva.

At that time, in Normandy, the magnetic illnesses of mediums were hardly known, and this un happy sleep - walker, who ought to have been cared for an cured, was roughly treated and even beaten, not even in his fludic appearance, but in his proper person, by the Vicar himself. That is, one must agree, a singular kind of exorcism! If those violence s really took place, and if they may be imputed to a Churchman whom one considers, and who may be, for all we know, very good and very respectable, let us admit that such writers as MM. de Mirville and Gougenet Desmousseaux make themselves not a little his accomplices! The laws of physical life are inexorable, and in his animal nature man is born a slave to fatality; it is by dint of struggles against his instincts that he may win moral freedom. Two different existences are then possible for us upon the ea rth; one fatal, the other free. The fatal being is the toy or instrument of a force which he does not direct. Now, when the instruments of fatality meet and collide, the stronger breaks or carries away the weaker; truly emancipated beings fear neither be witchments nor mysterious influences. You may reply that an encounter with Cain may be fatal for Abel. Doubtless; but such a fatality is an advantage to the pure and holy victim, it is only a misfortune for the assassin. Just as among the righteous ther e is a great community of virtues and merits, there is among the wicked an absolute solidarity of fatal culpability and necessary chastisement. Crime resides in the tendencies of the heart. Circumstances which are almost always independent of the will ar e the only causes of the gravity of the acts.

Seneca, Burrhus, Thrasea, Corbulon, theirs is the real guilt of that fearful reign; great men who were either selfish or incapable! The only thing they knew was how to die. If one of the bears of the Zoological Gardens escaped and devoured several people, would one blame him or his keepers? Whoever frees himself from the common errors of mankind is obliged to pay a ransom proportional to the sum of these errors: Socrates pays for Aneitus, and Jesus was obliged to suffer a torment whose terror was equal to the whole treason of Judas. Thus, by paying the debts of fatality, hard - won liberty purchases the empire of the world; it is hers to bind and to unbind. God has put in her hands the keys of Heaven and of Hell. You men who abandon brutes to themselves wish them to devour you. The rabble, slaves of fatality, can only enjoy liberty by absolute obedience to the will of free men; they ough t to work for those who are responsible for them. But when the brute governs brutes, when the blind leads the blind, when the leader is as subject to fatality as the masses, what must one expect? What but the most shocking catastrophes?

To brave God and to insult Him, is a final act of faith. “The dead praise thee not, O Lord,” said the Psalmist; and we might add if we dared: “The dead do not blaspheme thee.” “O my son!” said a father as he leaned over the bed of his child who had fallen into lethargy after a violent access of delirium: “insult me again, beat me, bite me, I shall feel that you are still alive, but do not rest for ever in the frightful silence of the tomb!” A great crime always comes to protest against great lukewarmness. A hundred thousand good priests, had their charity been more active, might have prevented the crime of the wretch Verger. The Chu rch has the right to judge, condemn and punish an ecclesiastic who causes scandal; but she has not the right to abandon him to the frenzies of despair and the temptations of misery and hunger. Nothing is so terrifying as nothingness, and if one could ever formulate the conception of it, if it were possible to admit it, Hell would be a thing to hope for.

Assassination would then become a virtue when it exercised the reprisals of outraged nature. Private vengeance would protest against the absence of public expiation, and from the splinters of the broken sword of j ustice anarchy would forge its daggers. “If God did away with Hell, men would make another in order to defy Him,” said a good priest to us one day.

It is by the victories of toil that one escapes from the fatalities of sorrow. What we call death is but the eternal parturition of Natu re.

This war is as ancient as the world; the Greeks figured it under the symbols of Eros and Anteros, and the Hebrews by the antagonism of Cain and Abel. It is the war of th e Titans and the Gods.

While love is nothing but a desire and an enjoyment, it is mortal. In order to make itself eternal it must become a sacrifice, for then it becomes a power and a virtue. It is the struggle of Eros and Anteros which produces the equilibrium of the world. Everything that over - excites sensibility leads to depravity and crime. Tears call for blood.

The impetuous currents of instinctive life and the feeble resistances of the will form an antagonism so distinct that the qabalists hypothesized the super - foetation of souls; that is to say, they believed in the presence in one body of several souls who dispute it with each other and often seek to destroy it. Very much as the shipwrecked sailors of the Medusa , when they were disputing the possession of the too small raft, sought to sink it. It is certain that, in making one’s self the servant of any current whatever, of instincts or even of ideas, one gives up one’s personality, and becomes the slave of that multitudinous spirit whom the Gospel calls legion . Artists know this well enough. Their frequent evocations of the universal light enervate them. They become mediu ms , that is to say, sick men. The more success magnifies them in public opinion, the more their personality diminishes. They become crotchety, envious, wrathful. They do not admit that any merit, even in a different sphere, can be placed besides theirs; and, having become unjust, they dispense even with politeness.

Let there be light! and there is light. Light, eternal as God, begins every day for all eyes that are open to see it. Truth will be eternally the invention and the creation of genius; it cries: Let there be light! and genius itself is, because light is. Genius is immortal because it understands tha t light is eternal. Genius contemplates truth as its work because it is the victor of light, and immortality is the triumph of light because it will be the recompense and crown of genius. But all spirits do not see with justness, because all hearts do not will with justice. There are souls for whom the true light seems to have no right to be. They content themselves with phosphorescent visions, abortions of light, hallucinations of thought; and, loving these phantoms, fear the day which will put them to flight, because they feel that, the day not being made for their eyes, they would fall back into a deeper darkness. It is thus that fools first fear, then calumniate, insult, pursue and condemn the sages. One must pity them, and pardon them, for they kno w not what they do.

Lacenaire, who spent his days in plotting murders, in order to have the means of passing his nights in ignoble orgies or in the excitement of gam bling, boasted aloud that he had lived. He called that living, and he sang a hymn to the guillotine, which he called his beautiful betrothed, and the world was full of imbeciles who admired the wretch! Alfred de Musset, before extinguishing himself in dr unkenness, wasted one of the finest talents of his century in songs of cold irony and of universal disgust. The unhappy man had been bewitched by the breath of a profoundly perverse woman, who, after having killed him, crouched like a ghoul upon his body and tore his winding sheet. We asked one day, of a young writer of this school, what his literature proved. It proves, he replied frankly and simply, that one must despair and die. What apostleship, and what a doctrine!

Judge the teachers by their works, said the supreme Master. This rule of judgment is infallible. If you wish me to believe in what you know, show me what you do. God, in order to exalt man to moral emancipation, hides Himself from him and abandons to him, after a fashion, t he government of the world. He leaves Himself to be guessed by the grandeurs and harmonies of nature, so that man may progressively make himself perfect by ever exalting the idea that he makes for himself of its author. Man knows God only by the names whi ch he gives to that Being of beings, and does not distinguish Him but by the images of Him which he endeavours to trace. He is then in a manner the creator of Him Who has created him.

Well, this programme is only paradoxical in its form, which lends itself to a false and sacri legious interpretation. In one sense it is perfectly reasonable, and the science of the adepts promises to realize it, and to accomplish it in perfection. Man, in effect, creates for himself a God corresponding to his own intelligence and his own goodness ; he cannot raise his ideal higher than his moral development permits him to do. The God whom he adores is always an enlargement of his own reflection. To conceive the absolute of goodness and justice is to be one's self exceeding just and good. The mora l qualities of the spirit are riches, and the greatest of all riches. One must acquire them by strife and toil. One may bring this objection, the inequality of aptitudes; some children are born with organisms nearer to perfection. But we ought to bel ieve that such organisms result from a more advanced work of Nature, and the children who are endowed with them have acquired them, if not by their own efforts, at least by the consolidated works of the human beings to whom their existence is bound. It is a secret of Nature, and Nature does nothing by chance; the possession of more developed intellectual faculties, like that of money and land, constitutes an indefeasible right of transmission and inheritance.

It is by the conquest of an intelligence eternally clear and of a will eternally just, that he constitutes himself as living for eternal li fe, since nothing survives injustice and error but the penalty of their disorder. To understand good is to will it, and on the plane of justice to will is to do. For this reason the Gospel tells us that men will be judged according to their works. Our works make us so much what we are, that our body itself, as we have said, receives the modification, and sometimes the complete change, of its form from our habits. A form conquered, or submitted to, becomes a providence, or a fatality, for all one's exist ence. Those strange figures which the Egyptians gave to the human symbols of divinity represent the fatal forms. Typhon has a crocodile's head. He is condemned to eat ceaselessly in order to fill his hippo - potamus belly. Thus he is devoted, by his gre ed and his ugliness, to eternal destruction. Man can kill or vivify his faculties by negligence or by abuse. He can create for himself new faculties by the good use of those which he has received from Nature. People often say that the affections will not be commanded, that faith is not possible for all, that one does not re - make one's own character. All these assertions are true only for the idle or the perverse. One can make one's self faithful, pious, loving, devoted, when one wishes sincerely to be s o.

In short, we are going to spea k the last word of magic. CHAPTER I OF TRANSFORMATION — THE WAND OF CIRCE — THE BATH OF MEDEA — MAGIC OVERCOME BY IT S OWN WEAPONS — THE GREAT ARCANUM OF THE JESUITS AND THE SEC RET OF THEIR POWER . T HE Bible tells us that King Nebuchadnezzar, at the highest poin t of his power and his pride, was suddenly changed into a beast. He fled into savage places, began to eat grass, let his beard and hair grow, as well as his nails, and remained in this state for seven years. In our Dogme et rituel de la haute magie , we hav e said what we think of the mysteries of lycanthropy, or the meta - morphosis of men into werewolves. Everyone knows the fable of Circe and understands its allegory."},{"pageNumber":557,"pageContent":"THE KE Y OF THE MYSTERIES 271 The fatal ascendant of one person on another is the true wand of Circe. One knows that almos t all human physiognomies bear a resemblance to one animal or another, that is to say, the signature of a specialized instinct. Now, instincts are balanced by contrary instincts, and dominated by instincts stronger than those. In order to dominate sheep, t he dog plays upon their fear of wolves. If you are a dog, and you want a pretty little cat to love you, you have only one means to take: to metamorphose yourself into a cat. But how! By observation, imitation and imagination. We think that our figurative language will be understood for once, and we recommend this revelation to all who wish to magnetize: it is the deepest of all the secrets of their art. Here is the formula in technical terms: “To polarize one's own animal light, in equilibrated antagonism with the contrary pole.” Or: To concentrate in one's self the special qualities of absorption in order to direct their rays towards an absorbing focus, and vice versa. This government of our magnetic polarization may be done by the assistance of the anima l forms of which we have spoken; they will serve to fix the imagination. Let us give an example: You wish to act magnetically upon a person polarized like yourself, which, if you are a magnetizer, you will divine at the first contact: only that person is a little less strong that you"},{"pageNumber":558,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 272 are, a mouse, while you are a rat. Make yourself a cat, and you will capture it. In one of the admirable stories which, though he did not invent it, he has told better than anybody, Perrault puts upon the stage a cat, which cunningly induces an ogre to change himself into a mouse, and the thing is no sooner done, than the mouse is crunched by the cat. The Tales of Mother Goose , like the Golden Ass of Apuleius, are perhaps true magical legends, and hide beneath the cloak of c hildish fairy tales the formidable secrets of science. It is a matter of common knowledge that magnetizers give to pure water the properties and taste of wine, liqueurs and every conceivable drug, merely by the laying - on of hands, that is to say, by their will expressed in a sign. One knows, too, that those who tame fierce animals conquer lions by making themselves mentally and magnetically stronger and fiercer than lions. Jules Gerard, the intrepid hunter of the African lion, would be devoured if he were a fraid. But, in order not to be afraid of a lion, one must make one's self stronger and more savage than the animal itself by an effort of imagination and of will. One must say to one's self: It is I who am the lion, and in my presence this animal is only a dog who ought to tremble before me. Fourier imagined anti - lions; Jules Gerard has realized that chimera of the phanlasterian 1 dreamer. But, one will say, in order not to fear lions, it is enough to be a man of courage and well armed. 1 Fourier was a Socialist who wrote a sort of “Utopia.” His social unit was the “phalanstère.” — T RANS ."},{"pageNumber":559,"pageContent":"THE KE Y OF THE MYSTERIES 273 No, that is not enough. One must know one's self by heart, so to speak, to be able to calculate the leaps of the animal, divining its stratagems, avoiding its claws, foreseeing its movements, to be in a word past - master in lioncraft, as the excellent La Fontaine might h ave said. Animals are the living symbols of the instincts and passions of men. If you make a man timid, you change him into a hare. If, on the contrary, you drive him to ferocity, you make a tiger of him. The wand of Circe is the power of fascination whi ch woman possesses; and the changing of the companions of Ulysses into hogs is not a story peculiar to that time. But no metamorphosis may be worked without destruction . To change a hawk into a dove, one must first kill it, then cut it to pierces, so as t o destroy even the least trace of its first form, and then boil it in the magic bath of Medea. Observe how modern hierophants proceed in order to accomplish human regeneration; how, for example, in the Catholic religion, they go to work in order to change a man more or less weak and passionate into a stoical missionary of the Society of Jesus. There is the great secret of that venerable and terrible Order, always misunderstood, often calumniated, and always sovereign. Read attentively the book entitled, The Exercises of St. Ignatius , and note with what magical power that man of genius operates the realization of faith. He orders his disciples to see, to touch, to smell, to taste invisible things. He wishes that the senses should be exalted during prayer t o the point of voluntary hallucination."},{"pageNumber":560,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 274 You are meditating upon a mystery of faith; St. Ignatius wishes, in the first place, that you should create a place, dream of it, see it, touch it.

Every one carries this out in his own fashion, but always in the way best suited to impress him. It is not the hashish intoxication which was useful to the knavery of the Old Man of the Mountain; it is a dream without sle ep, an hallucination without madness, a reasoned and willed vision, a real creation of intelligence and faith. Thence - forward, when he preaches, the Jesuit can say: “What we have seen with our eyes, what we have heard with our ears, and what our hands h ave handled, that do we declare unto you.” The Jesuit thus trained is in communion with a circle of wills exercised like his own; consequently each of the fathers is as strong as the Society, and the Soci ety is stronger than the world.

To be a long time young, or even to become young again, that is what would appear desirable and precious to the majority of men. It is possible? We shall examine the question. The famous Count of Saint - Germain is dead, we do not doubt, but no one ever saw him grow old. He appeared always of the age of forty years, and at the time of his greatest celebrity, he pretended to be over eighty. Ninon de l'Enclos, in her very old age, was still a young, beautiful and seductive woman. She died without having grown old. Desbarrolles, the celebrated palmist, has been for a long while for everybody a man of thirty - five years. His birth certificate would speak very differently if he dared to show it, but no one would believe it. Cagliostro always ap peared the same age. He pretended to possess not only an elixir which gave to the old, for an instant, all the vigour of youth; but he also prided himself on being able to operate physical regeneration by means which we hav e detailed and analysed in our History of Magic . Cagliostro and the Count of Saint - Germain attributed the preservation of their youth to the existence and use of the universal medicine, that medicament uselessly sought by so many hermetists and alchemists. An Initiate of the sixt eenth century, the good and learned William Postel, never pretended that he possessed the great arcanum of the hermetic philosophy; and yet after having"},{"pageNumber":562,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 276 been seen old and broken, he reappeared with a bright com - plexion, without wrinkles, his beard and hair black, his body agile and vigorous. His enemies pretended that he roughed, and dyed his hair; for scoffers and false savants must find some sort of explanation for the phenomena which they do not understand. The great magical means of preserving the youth of the body is to prevent the soul from growing old by preserving preciously that original freshness of sentiments and thoughts which the corrupt world calls illusions, and which we shall call the primitive mirages of eternal truth. To believe in happiness upon earth, in friendship, in love, in a maternal Providence which counts all our steps, and will reward all our tears, is to be a perfect dupe, the corrupt world will say; it does not see that it is itself who is the dupe, believing itself s trong in depriving itself of all the delights of the soul. To believe in moral good is to possess that good: for this reason the Saviour of the world promises the kingdom of heaven to those who should make themselves like little children. What is child hood? It is the age of faith. The child knows nothing yet of life; and thus he radiates confident immortality. Is it possible for him to doubt the devotion, the tenderness, the friendship, and the love of Providence when he is in the arms of his mother? Become children in heart, and you will remain young in body. The realities of God and nature surpass infinitely in beauty and goodness all the imagination of men.

To enjoy even the animal pleasures of life one must have the moral sense; and those who calumniate existence have certainly abused it. High magic, as w e have proved, leads man back to the laws of the purest morality. Either he finds a thing holy or makes it holy, says an adept — Vel sanc tum invenit, vel sanctum facit; because it makes us understand that in order to be happy, even in this world, one must be holy. To be holy! that is easy to say; but how give one's self faith when one no longer believes? How re - discover a taste for virtue in a heart faded by vice? One must have recourse to the four words of science: to know, to dare, to will, an d to keep silence. One must still one's dislikes, study duty, and begin by practising it as though one loved it. You are an unbeliever, and you wish to make yourself a Christian? Perform the exercises of a Christian, pray regularly, using the Chri stian formulae; approach the sacraments as if you had faith, and faith will come. That is the secret of the Jesuits, contained in the Spiritual Exercises of St. Ignatius. By similar exercises, a fool, if he will it with perseverance, would become a wise man. 1 By changing the habits of the soul one certainly changes those of the body; we have already said so, and we have explained the method. What contributes above all to age us by making us ugly?

The most perverse man has a good side to him, and softens when one knows how to take him. If you had nothing in common with the vices of men, you would not even perceive them. Friendship, and the devotions which it in spires, are found even in prisons and in convict stations. The horrible Lacenaire faithfully returned any money which had been lent to him, and frequently acted with generosity and kindness. I have no doubt that in the life of crime which Cartouche and M andrin led there were acts of virtue fit to draw tears from the eyes. There has never been any one absolutely bad or absolutely good . “ There is none good but God, ” said the best of the Masters. That quality in ourselves which we call zeal for virtue i s often nothing but a masterful secret self - love, a jealousy in disguise, and a pro ud instinct of contradiction. “ When we see manifest di sorders and scandalous sinners, ” say mystical theologians, “ let us believe that God is submitting them to greater test s than those with which He tries us, that certainly, or at least very probably, we are not as good as they are, and shoul d do much worse in their place. ” Peace!

In fact, to the true Christian even repentance is not a sorrow; it is a conso lation, a joy, and a triumph. “ I wished evil, and I wish it no m ore; I was dead and I am alive. ” The father of the Prodigal son has killed the fatted calf because his son has returned. What c an he do? Tears and embarrassment, no doubt! but above all joy! There is only one sad thing in the world, and that is sin and folly. Since we are delivered, let us laugh and shout for joy, for we are saved, and all those who loved us in their lives re joice in heaven! We all bear within ourselves a principle of death and a principle of immortality. Death is the beast, and the beast produces always bestial stupidity. God does not love fools, for his divine spirit is called the spirit of intelligence . Stupidity expiates itself by suffering and slavery. The stick is made for beasts. Suffering is always a warning. So much the worse for him who does not understand it! When Nature tightens the rein, it is that we are swerving; when she plies the whi p, it is that danger is imminent. Woe, then, to him who does not reflect! When we are ripe for death, we leave life without regret, and nothing would make us take it back; but when death is premature, the soul regrets life, and a clever thaumaturgist w ould be able to recall it to the body.

It was after a lethargy of this kind that William Postel, recalled to life by Mother Jeanne, reappeared with a new youth, and called himself no longer anything but Postel the Resur rected, Postellus restitutus . In the year 1799 , there was in the Faubourg St. Antoine, at Paris, a blacksmith who gave himself out to be an adept of hermetic science. His name was Leriche, and he passed for having performed miraculous cures and even resurrections by the use of the universal med icine. A ballet girl of the Opé ra, who believed in him, came one day to see him, and said to him, weeping, that her lover had just died. M. Leriche went out with her to the house of death. As he entered, a pe rson w ho was going out, said to him: “ It is useless for you to go u pstairs, he died six hours ago. ” “ Nev er mind, ” said the blacksmith, “ since I am here I will see him. ” He went upstairs, and found a corpse frozen in every part except in the hollow of the stomach, where he thought that he still felt a little heat.

They redoubled their efforts, and soon obtained a still better marked sign of life. They then put him in a well warmed bed, and a few hours afterwards he was entirely restored to life. The name of this pers on was Candy. He lived from that time without ever being ill. In 1845 he was still alive, and was living at Place du Chevalier du Guet, 6 . He would tell the story of his resurrection to any one who would listen to him, and gave much occasion for laughte r to the doctors and wiseacres of his quarter.

Such is the question of human ignorance in its most frequent and its saddest doubts. This, too, is what the human embryo may vaguely ask itself at the approach of that birth which is about to throw it into an unknown world by stripping it of its protective envelope. Let us study the mystery of birth, and we shall have the key of the great arcanum of death! Thrown by the laws of Nature into the womb of a woman, the incarnated spirit very slowly wakes, and creates for itself with effort organs which will later be indispensable, but which as they grow increase its disco mfort in its present situation. The happiest period of the life of the embryo is that when, like a chrysalis, it spreads around it the membrane which serves it for refuge, and which swims with it in a nourishing and preserving fluid. At that time it is f ree, and does not suffer. It partakes of the universal life, and receives the imprint of the memories of Nature which will later determine the configuration of its body and the form of its features. That happy age may be called the childhood of the embry o. Adolescence follows; the human form becomes distinct, and its sex is determined; a movement takes place in the maternal egg which resembles the vague reveries of that age which follows upon childhood. The placenta, which is the exterior and the real body of the foetus, feels germinating in itself something unknown, which already tends to break it and escape. The child then enters more distinctly into the life of dreams.

During embryonic life it seemed to it that the placenta was its body, and it was in fact its special embryonic body, a body useless for another life, a body which had to be thrown off as an unclean thing at the moment of birth. The body of our human life is like a second en velope, useless for the third life, and for that reason we throw it aside at the moment of our second birth.

Soon their moral soul will be naked, and in order to hide its shame by making itself at all costs a new veil, it will be obliged to drag itself into the outer darkness, and pass slowly through the dead sea, the slumbering waters of ancient chaos. These wounded souls are the larvae of the second formation of the embryo; t hey nourish their airy bodies with a vapour of shed blood, and they fear the point of the sword. Frequently they attach themselves to vicious men and live upon their lives, as the embryo lives in its mother's womb.

Around the triangle is the cross which divides the circle into four equal parts, and thus the symbols of religion are united to the signs of geometry; faith completes science, and science acknowledge faith.

In this case I must protest emphatically against the emp loyment of a translator who makes a solecism nearly every time he touches Paris. E.g . ‘northern railway station’ for ‘Gare du Nord,’ ‘Lilas brewery’ for ‘Closerie des Lilas,' 'St. Martin's Gate' for 'Porte St. Martin,' 'Rue de Fleurs’ for ‘Rue des Fle urs,’ ‘racecourse’ for some unindicated part of the Jardin du Luxembourg, ‘churchyard’ of Montparnasse for ‘cemetery,’"},{"pageNumber":582,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 228 ‘exhibition of independent artists’ for ‘Salon des Independents,’ ‘Bull - ier's dancing saloon’ for ‘Bal Bullier,’ ‘Lyons Bank’ for ‘Credit Lyon - nais,’ ‘St. Germaine des Pres’ for ‘St. Germain des Pres,’ ‘Dr. Popus’ for ‘Dr. Papus,’ ‘Rue de Madame’ for ‘Rue Madame,’ and so on. He puts the same place - name — first in translation, then in French, again and again; and as often as not gets both wr ong! The constant chemical absurdities are perhaps Strindberg's own and may have been made intentionally, as the book portrays the ravings of a melancholic with delusions of persecution. What sublime and septuple ass calls this Strindberg's autobiography? Strindberg was too lazy to find his incidents in other people's lives; that is all. And yet we find the translator note at the end: “Strindberg never actually entered the Roman Church” !!! The book is a perfect clinical picture of a typical case. Chapter I describes the irritability, the fantastic dreams. He imagines himself a great author, a great chemist. He has found carbon in sulphur; he will make gold. In Chapter II he begins to see omens in simple incidents, receives “warnings” from strangers, fi nds a plot against him at his hotel, notices remarkable resemblances between his neighbours and some of his “persecutors.” Chapter III develops the persecution - delusions. Roaring in the ears, electric shocks, and other physical symptoms develop. The beds tead has knobs like those of a leyden jar, the spring mattress suggests induction coils, and so on — to the end! For refuge he ranges from Papus to Swedenborg, and ultimately, as his mental disease increases on him, he clutches at such straws as Péladan, A nnie Besant, and the Church of Rome. In this dementia the book ends. But Strindberg did not end. He went his cheerful and polygamous way as a free - thinker. Persons who pretend otherwise are liars, probably hired liars — unless, of course, they are English men, who are such natural - born fools in all matters of the soul that they not only require no bribe to lie, but can hardly be paid to see truth. Until Strindberg's life is utterly dissociated from his art, the latter will not be truly valued.     A.C. W IND A LONG THE W ASTE . By M AUDE A NNESLEY . William Rider & Son.

When I was first in Paris for any length of time, the rage wa s all for professional bicyclists.

The best known of England's “heroic widows” a t that time kept a tame but half - witted giant with an enormous black beard; the whole of his body was, I was told, as hirsuite as a bear. A daughter of the nobility contented herself with more lyric loves than these. A well - to - do girl from Calcutta prac tised sheer promiscuity; an exquisitely beautiful woman of the middle classes did worse, and actually married a most hideous dwarf. To - day things are very much the same. A very celebrated dancer from America never goes on the stage without previously dragg ing a stranger — a man from the street, a stage carpenter, it matters nothing — to her dressing - room. One of our best known women art critics haunts the lowest brothels of the Bd.

The English and American women in the Café du Dôme solidly, stupidly drunk, dribble c urses when their maquereaux “American sculptors” are late; the peace of the Avenue des Champs Elysées is broken by the wild - beast howls of the harlot harridans who, driven from Chicago and Denver by the police, despair of finding such products as prairie air and cow - punching can alone supply.

Her story, moreover, is exceedingly well told, up to the point of the hero's death. The sequel appears to me somewhat an anticlimax, strained, artificia l, and boring. (At least I would rather she had carried out the vendetta by killing the son, as her lover had killed the father.) I suppose it is the publisher again. “Yes, what a nice story! Now if you'll add 40,000 words of dialogue about love and mak e the story end happily perhaps we might do something.” A publisher offered to take my Ercildoune if I'd “pad it to 150,000 words!” Well, Maude Annesley, ma môme, you're a very luck child to get your novels published at all in this rotten country, and if the homage and devotion of a colleague who has no such luck can serve you, command it!"},{"pageNumber":584,"pageContent":"THE EQUINOX 230 Be wary, though, and never stir a step from your own ground.

BY ALEISTER CROWLE Y The “Daily Mail” says — “This is a garland of some fifty or sixty devotional hymns to the Virgin, in which the author, while not exceeding the bounds of Catholic orthodoxy, fills his verses with quaint and charming conceits, very much in the style of th e ‘metaphysical’ poets of the seventeenth century. Indeed, in turning over the pages of ‘Amphora,’ as the little volume was entitled when published anonymously two years ago, by Burns & Oates, we feel them to be the work of a recipient of the tradition of Vaughan the Silurist, George Herbert, and Crashaw, although Mr. Crowley is smooth where they are rugged, plain where they are perplexing. “These poems indicate a mind full of earnest aspiration towards his spiritual Queen, a mind of an engaging naiveté , un - troubled by the religious and philosophical problems which weary more complex intelligences. This little work can be cordially recommended to Catholic readers.” Father Kent writes in “The Tablet” — “Among the many books which benevolent publishers are preparing as appropriate Christmas presents we notice many new editions of favourite poetic classics. But few, we fancy, can be more appropriate for the purpose than a little volume of original verses, entitled 'Amphora,' which Messrs. Burns & Oates a re on the point of publishing. The following stanzas from a poem on the Nativity will surely be a better recommendation of the book than any words of critical appreciation: “The Virgin lies at Bethlehem. (Bring gold and frankin cense and myrrh!) The root of David shoots a stem. (O Holy Spirit, shadow her!) “She lies alone amid the kine. (Bring gold and frankincense and myrrh!) The straw is fragrant as with wine. (O Holy Spirit, shadow her!)” Lieut. - Col. Gormley writes — “The hymns ordinarily used in churches for devotional purposes are no doubt excellent in their way, but it can scarcely be said, in the case of many of them, that they are of much litera ry merit, and some of them indeed are little above the familiar nursery rhymes of our childhood; it is therefore somewhat of a relief and a pleasure to read the volume of hymns to the Virgin Mary which has just been published by Messrs. Burns & Oates. The se hymns to the Virgin Mary are in the best style, they are devotional in the highest degree, and to Roman Catholics, for whom devotion to the Virgin Mary forms so important a part of their religious belief, these poems should indeed be welcome; personally I have found them just what I desired, and I have no doubt other Catholics will be equally pleased with them.\" “Vanity Fair” says — “To the ordinary mind passion has no relation to penitence, and carnal desire is the very anti - thesis of spiritual fervour. But close observers of human nature are accustomed to discover an intimate connection between the forces of the body and the soul; and the student of psychology is continually being reminded of the kinship between saint and sinner. Now and then we find the extremes of self and selflessness in the same soul. Dante tells us how the lover kissed the trembling mouth, and with the same thrill describes his own passionate abandonment before the mystic Rose. In our own day, the greatest of French lyric poe ts, Verlaine, has given us volumes of the most passionate love songs, and side by side with them a book of religious poetry more sublimely credulous and ecstatic than anything that has come down to us from the Ages of faith. We are all, as Sainte - Beuve said, ‘children of a sensual literature,’ and perhaps for that reason we should expect from our singers fervent religious hymns. “There is one of London's favourites almost unrivalled to express by her art the delights of the body with a pagan simplicity and directness. Now she sends us a book, ‘Amphora,’ a volume of religious verse: it contains song after song in praise of Mary,” etc. etc. etc. The “Scotsman” says — “Outside the Latin Church conflicting views are held about the worship of the Virgin, but there can be no doubt that this motive of religion has given birth to many beautiful pieces of literature, and the poets have never tired of singing variations on the theme of ‘Hail Mary.’ This little book is best described here as a collection of such variations. They are written with an engaging simplicity and fervour of feeling, and with a graceful, refined literary art that cannot but interest and attract many readers beyond the circles of such as must feel it religiously impossible not to admire them.” The “Daily Telegraph” says — “In this slight volume we have the utterances of a devout anonymous Roman Catholic singer, in a number of songs or hymns addressed to the Virgin Mary. The author, who has evidently a decided gift for sacred verse and ha s mastered varied metres suitable to her high themes, divides her poems into four series of thirteen each — thus providing a song for each week of the year. The songs are all of praise or prayer addressed to the Virgin, and though many have a touch of mys ticism, most have a simplicity of expression and earnestness of devotion that will commend them to the author's co - religionists.” The “Catholic Herald” says — “This anonymous volume of religious verse reaches a very high level of poetic imagery. It is a s eries of hymns in honour of Our Lady, invariably expressed in melodious verse. The pitfalls of religious verse are bathos and platitude, but these the sincerity of the writer and a certain mastery over poetic expression have enabled him — or her — to avoid. The writer of such verse as the following may be complimented on a very high standard of poetic expression: “The shadows fall about the way; Strange faces glimmer in the gloom; The soul clings feebly to the cl ay, For that, the void; for this, the tomb! “But Mary sheds a blessed light; Her perfect face dispels the fears. She charms Her melancholy knight Up to the glad and gracious spher es. “ O Mary, like a pure perfume Do thou receive this falling breath, And with Thy starry lamp illume The darkling corridors of death!” The “Catholic Times” says — “The ‘Amphora’ is a collectio n of poems in honour of our Blessed Lady. They are arranged in four books, each of which contains thirteen pieces. Thus with the prologue there are fifty - three poems in all. Needless to say they breathe a spirit of deep piety and filial love towards o ur Heavenly Mother. Many beautiful and touching thoughts are embodied in the various verses, which cannot but do good to the pious soul.” The “Staffordshire Chronicle” says — “Under this title there has appeared an anonymous volume of verses breathing the same exotic fragrance of Rossetti’s poem on Our Lady that begins ‘Mother of the fair delight.’ There is the same intense pre - Raphaelite atmosphere, the same aesthetic revelling in Catholic mysticism, the same rich imagery and gorgeous word - colouring that pervade the poetic works of that nineteenth - century artist. A valuable addition to the poetic literature on the Mother of our Lord.” The “Guardian” says — “The devotional fervour of ‘Amphora’ will make them acceptable to those who address their worship t o the Blessed Mother of the Christ. The meaning of the title of the book is not very obvious. It cannot surely have anything to do with the lines in Horace, ‘Amphora coepit,’ ” etc. The “Catholic Times” says — “As far as we can gather from his other works , the author is not a Catholic, perhaps not even, strictly speaking, a Christian; but here we have page after page of most exquisite praise of Her, whom Wordsworth greeted as ‘our tainted nature's solitary boast,’ until one marvels at the fecundity of conc ept, imagery, and fit expression.” WIELAND & CO., 33 Avenue Studios, South Kensington, London, S.W.

Miss Archer's poems are both mystical and realistic, and they bear traces of having been to so me extent influenced by the work of Mr. Aleister Crowley, but without losing an originality which is entirely their own.\" --- \" T. P.'s Weekly .\" “This book has all the defects and none of the qualities of Mr. Crowley's work. . . . Miss Ethel Archer misses everything. There is no élan in the work. She has none of the happy fluency of her master, and it requires much to carry off the cumbrous apparatus of esoteric epithets with which she is burdened. Miss Archer's mechanical abnormalities are ridiculous; she has mistaken jingle for music and incomprehensibility for passion. . . . The world will not willingly let it die.” — Vanity Fair . “On the cover a naked woman is riding a bat over a whirlpool; craggy white mountains are behind her and a red sky behind al l. There is a fine fierceness of movement in the design; it is certainly good. Mr. Aleister Crowley introduces Miss Archer briefly but splendidly, with phrases of this sort: ‘We find such rime - webs as abaaab - babbba . . . , more exquisite than all the ara besques of the Alhambra.” . . . It is all very splendid. . . . We feel drearily sensible of our outer darkness. Coming to Miss Archer's poetry we are obliged to notice her debt to Swinburne, yet we find it, on the whole, good. . . . The colour is very str ong; the shades of thought are clear, and often subtle. . . . The uninitiated may certainly recognise great strength of conviction in Miss Archer, even if they cannot or do not wish to appreciate it.” — The Poetry Review. “Several of these unpleasant phantas ies are reprinted from the Equinox , and there is an introduction by Aleister Crowley, in which he says this book is the hell of sterile passion glowing in the heart of the hell of desolation.” — Times Literary Supplement . “There is a resemblance in much of M iss Archer's verse to the sensuous school of English poetry, and it has the same lyrical power. Love in its various forms is the theme of her songs, and she expresses her thoughts in vivid words. The portrayal of the intensity of personal feeling with an unguarded freedom, is that which a student of pre - Raphaelite poetry would naturally acquire.

On the whole, we cannot help regretting that such splendi d powers of imagination and expression are flung away in such literary rioting.” — Light . “Sometimes of much beauty of rhythm and phrase. . . .” — Times . “Poets who have any originality deserve to be judged by their own standard. . . .

Mr. Neuburg has a ‘careless rapture’ all his own; the carelessness, indeed, is just the trouble. His versification is remarkable, and there is something impressive in its mere fluency. . . . So luxurious, so rampant, a decadence quickly palls. . . . On the whole, this book must be pronounced a quite grievous exhibition of recklessness and folly.” — Manchester Guardian . “. . .

B. Neuburg’s ‘Triumph of Pan’ (‘The Equinox’ Office), much of which merits the ambiguous distinction of being unusual. Th ough by no means deficient in originality, vigour or imaginative power, his verse is too often cumbered with the fantastic symbols of a species of erotic mysticism, into which we feel no desire to probe; while the lack of reticence consistently displaye d constitutes an artistic blemish not lightly to be excused. The author’s serene confidence in the immortality of his lays would be better justified were he to make some attempt to discriminate between the gold and the rubbish, and, incidentally, refrain ing from penning such grotesque - ness as is contained, for example, in ‘The Sunflower,’ where we are informed how, among other portents —  “ ‘a greater god arose, And stole the earth by standing on his toes And blowing through the air.’ “It is difficult to believe that the persons to whom certain poems are inscribed will experience any very lively gratification at the compliment.” — Athenaeum . “. . . really notable fluency and fecundity of expression. . . .

It is brilliant work . . . one is bound to admire the cleverness of it all.” — Litera ry Guide . “. . . In the author of the present collection of poems . . . we have a veritable twentieth - century mystic and apostle of ecstasy who, according to his dedication, gives his songs —  “ ‘By the sign that is black and forbidden,  By the word that is uttered no more.’ “'The Triumph of Pan,' from which the book borrows its title, is a remarkable sequence of some forty ‘philosophic and ecstatic’ stanzas . . . he would also seem to ‘hold opinion with Pythagoras’ a lthough we question if even Nietzsche himself could quite fathom the undercurrent of the lay. . . . Despite occasional extravagances in thought and in diction his work is that of a cultured scholar, his verbal artistry undeniably inspired with the true spirit of poetry. Whether he sings of ‘Violet skies all rimmed in tune,’ of red ravens, of purple kisses, of silver stars ‘crested with amber melody,’ or of the 'rhythmic sway of the idle moon,' he is always musical albeit, like Wagner, whose effects he now and then distinctly recalls, often utterly unintelligible. . . . In striking contrast to the chaste and serenely beautiful ‘Diana Rides’ . . . are no less that twenty - two audaciously passionate love - lyrics inscribed not only to one Olivia Vane, but also, curiously enough to her ‘other’ lover.” — The Gambolier . “He has arrived. . . . “Mr. Neuburg's work is partly mystical and partly of the flesh. . . . Quite frankly, some of his work we do not at all understand. This applies notably to his ‘Music - Pi ctures,’ which ‘were obtained under the direct influence of music.’ ‘This,’ the poet naively tells us, ‘may explain their apparent incon - sequence.’ . . . he is much more than a minor poet. He can and will yet accomplish great work. . . . His ingenious rhyming capacity sometimes almost startles one. In the choice of some of this subjects he is daring — greatly daring. . . .

A ∴ A ∴ PUBLICATION IN CLASS B. ====================== BOOK 777 HIS book contains in concise tabulated form a comparative view of all the symbols of the great religions of th e world; the perfect attributions of the Taro, so long kept secret by the Rosicrucians, are now for the first time published; also the complete secret magical correspondences of the G ∴ D ∴ and R. R. et A. C. It forms, in short, a complete magical and philos ophical dictionary; a key to all religions and to all practical occult working. For the first time Western and Qabalistic symbols have been harmonized with those of Hinduism, Buddhism, Mohammedanism, Taoism, &c. By a glance at the Tables, anybody conversa nt with any one system can understand perfectly all others. The Occult Review says: “Despite its cumbrous sub - title and high price per page, this work has only to come under the notice of the right people to be sure of a ready sale. In its author’s words, it represents ‘an attempt to systematise alike the data of mysticism and the results of comparative religion,’ and so far as any book can succeed in such an attempt, this book does succeed; that is to say, it condenses in some sixty pages as much informati on as many an intelligent reader at the Museum has been able to collect in years. The book proper consists of a Table of ‘Correspondences,’ and is, in fact, an attempt to reduce to a common denominator the symbolism of as many religious and magical system s as the author is acquainted with. The denominator chosen is necessarily a large one, as the author's object is to reconcile systems which divide all things into 3, 7, 10, 12, as the case may be. Since our expression ‘common denominator' is used in a fi gurative and not in a strictly mathematical sense, the task is less complex than appears at first sight, and the 32 Paths of the Sepher Yetzirah, or Book of Formation of the Qabalah, provide a convenient scale. These 32 Paths are attributed by the Qabalist s to the 10 Sephiroth, or Emanations of Deity, and to the 22 letters of the Hebrew alphabet, which are again subdivided into 3 mother letters, 7 double letters, and 12 simple letters. On this basis, that of the Qabalistic ‘Tree of Life,' as a certain arran gement of the Sephiroth and 22 remaining Paths connecting them is termed, the author has constructed no less than 183 tables. “The Qabalistic information is very full, and there are tables of Egyptian and Hindu deities, as well as of colours, perfumes, pl ants, stones, and animals. The information concerning the tarot and geomancy exceeds that to be found in some treatises devoted exclusively to those subjects. The author appears to be acquainted with Chinese, Arabic, and other classic texts. Here your r eviewer is unable to follow him, but his Hebrew does credit alike to him and to his printer. Among several hundred words, mostly proper names, we found and marked a few misprints, but subsequently discovered each one of them in a printed table of errata, which we had overlooked. When one remembers the misprints in ‘Agrippa’ and the fact that the ordinary Hebrew compositor and reader is no more fitted for this task than a boy cognisant of no more than the shapes of the Hebrew letters, one wonders how many proofs there were and what the printer’s bill was. A knowledge of the Hebrew alphabet and the Qabalistic Tree of Life is all that is needed to lay open to the reader the enormous mass of information contained in this book. The ‘Alphabet of Mysticism,’ as the author says — several alphabets we should prefer to say — is here. Much that has been jealously and foolishly kept secret in the past is here, but though our author has secured for his work the imprimatur of some body with the mysterious title of the A ∴ A ∴ , and though he remains himself anonymous, he appears to be no mystery - monger. Obviously he is widely read, but he makes no pretence that he has secrets to reveal. On the contrary, he says, ‘an indicible arcanum is an arcanum which cannot be revealed.’ The writer of that sentence has learned at least one fact not to be learned from books. “G.C.J.” T"},{"pageNumber":613,"pageContent":" WILLIAM NORTHAM Robemaker, 9 Henrietta Street, Southampton Street, Strand T ELEPHONE — 5400 Central MR.

WHICH IS ALSO FALSELY CALLED BREAKS By Frater Perdurabo. (Wieland & Co., 21s.) Poetry and Drama says: Creation and destruction of Gods has been for ce nturies mankind's favourite religious mania and philosophical exercise. “The Book of Lies” is a witty, instructive, and wholly admirable collection of paradoxes, in themselves contradictory, summing up and illustrating various experiments in God - making. Frater Perdurabo, however, has not written a philosophical or mystical treatise; on the contrary, his book leaves one with a feeling of intense exhilaration and clearheadedness. The book cannot be judged by the mere reading of excerpts; nor can it be read straight through. Indeed, if one is really desirous to appreciate its subtleties, this should not be attempted before 12 p.m. To be carried about and discussed at leisure, to annoy, repel, stimulate, puzzle and interest, are evidently some few of its fun ctions. Stupendously idiotic and amazingly clever, it is at the same time the quintessence of paradox and simplicity itself; yet when all this is said one is still far from the core, for just when one thinks to have discovered it, one finds that many obv ious beauties of thought and expression have been over - looked, others misinterpreted. Sometimes one is even doubtful if the author himself could translate into definite terms the exact meaning of his aphorisms and paradoxes without detracting from the val ue of the book as artistic expression of the personality. This is, however, an individual appreciation. “The Book of Lies” will be interpreted differently by each reader and judged accordingly. — A. d. R. The New Witness says: I have read with great care t wo very extraordinary books for which one Frater Perdurabo is partly or wholly responsible, “The Book of Lies,” and “Book Four,” both published by Messrs. Wieland & Co., Avenue Studios, South Kensington. “Book Four” is sold for a shilling, but “The Book o f Lies” is evidently far more precious, for though its wisdom fills only 116 small black - edged pages, it is not obtainable for less than a guinea. Allow me to reproduce its name and description in full ( done ) Now that, I thought, was rather pleasant, but looking on I perceived that these breaks could not be profitable to me without a severe intellectual preparation. I turned to “Book Four,” and there I read: “this book is intentionally not the work of Frater Perdurabo. Experience shows that his writing is too concentrated, too abstruse, too occult for ordinary minds to apprehend.” “Book Four” seems intended as a kind of introduction to the “Book of Lies.” It has also other objects. It tells one, for example, how to procure certain of the very inter esting works of Mr. Aleister Crowley for the insignificant sum of 6 guineas, 31 dollars, or 156 francs. It tells one, also, how to approach the throne of the Brother, how to gain a spiritual power not unlike his, although he is anxious, being “the most h onest of all the great religious teachers,” that nobody shall believe him. Hoping some day to be able to write little books that should sell for a guinea apiece, and also to understand “The Book of Lies,” I set myself vehemently to the study of “Book Fo ur.” I experimented with “the seven keys to the great gate,” though I admit my ambition led me to concentrate my energies chiefly on “Meditation,” as Soror Virakam says that this, as described in “Book Four,” is “The Way of Attainment of Genius or Godhead considered as a development of the human Brain.” Genius or Godhead; either would suit me well. I will not describe my experiments in detail but rather their results, which were a very bad cold in the head, and a few words of poetry which I am informed are worthy of Shakespeare and were indeed used by him in his noblest tragedy. Facing page 25 of “Book Four” is a photograph of a man naked sitting on the floor hugging his shins and hiding his face in his knees. I observed it with reverence, for it might perhaps represent Frater Perdurabo himself, whom I have not the honour of knowing by sight. Opposite the picture I read: “The Student must now set his teeth and go through with it.” I set my teeth. I went through with it, and, perhaps because February i s a rather wintry month, there resulted first the Shakespearean words and secondly a very bad catarrh. The words were these: — “Poor Tom. . . . Tom’s a - cold.” If any should doubt the Shakespearean nature of this inspiration, my informant, who knows the wor ks of that great master, refers to the Tragedy of Lear, Act iii. Scene 4 . Frater Perdurabo has not been so fortunate. Indeed, I fear that though his method lifted me to Shakespeare's level in “Genius or Godhead” it played its inventor false. Perhaps two or three or even more “ways of attainment” clashed with each other. Or — and with reverence must we contemplate this possibility — Frater Perdurabo attained too much. He put himself so vigorously in motion towards his goal that he overshot it and was carrie d past the common godhead or genius and hurled into something far beyond it, a region of super - divinity or super - genius so far above us that language will not bridge the gap — the gulf that divides its perfect wisdom from our feeble grouping expression. Let me give an example of the poetry of Frater Perdurabo. A few of the names of his poems will no doubt sharpen our appetite, so I copy them out from the list which Frater Perdurabo calls “Pro and Con Tents”: “The Sabbath of the Goat,” “The H IMOG ” (a note e xplains that this means “Holy Illuminated Man of God”), “Corn Beef Hash,” “Trouble with Twins,” “Skidoo,” “Haggai - Howlings,” “The Blind Pig” (a mote explains that pg = PG = Pig without an I = Blind Pig). Many of the other titles are no less promising. Here, however, is the chapter called “Skidoo.” “SKIDOO.” “What man is at ease in his Inn?” — “Get out.” — “Wide is the world and cold.” — “Get out.” — “Thou hast become an in - itiate.” — “Get out” — “But thou canst not get out by the way thou camest in. The way out i s T HE W AY .” — “Get out.” — “For OUT is Love and Wisdom and Power.” — “Get out.” — “If thou hast T already, first get UT.” — “Then get O.” — “And so at last get out.” There are two notes to this chapter which do not, to my mind, much elucidate it. “O,” we are told. “= j , The Devil of the Sabbath; U = b , the Hierophant or Redeemer; T = Strength, the Lion.” “T,” on the other hand, is “manhood, the sign of the cross or phallus; UT, the Holy Guardian Angel; UT, the first syllable of Udgita, see the Upanishads; O, Nothing , or Nuit.” Here is something far beyond Shakespearean simplicity. Perhaps I should have attained to it if I had persisted in my naked meditation on the floor, beyond the very bad cold that brought it to an end. Let me take another example: — “PHAETON.” “N o.” — “Yes” — “Perhaps.” — “O!” — “Eye.” — “Hi!” — “Y?” — “No.” — “Hail! all ye spavined, gelded, hamstrung horses!” — “Ye shall surpass the planets in their courses.” — “How? Not by speed, nor strength, nor power to stay, but by the Silence that succeeds the Neigh!” There a re no notes to this chapter. “This book,” another chapter tells us, “would translate Beyond - Reason into the words of Reason.” The difficulty the author encountered was like that of explaining snow to the inhabitants of the Tropics. The result is quite un intelligible to a simple brother like myself, whose only effort so far has been to keep on the hither side of reason, who is also hampered by the cold in the head given him by the position pictured in “Book Four.” Yet through these Haggai - Howlings, I admi t, there does appear a personality, perhaps a philosophy, a doubt of a doubt of a doubt (I offer this phrase to Frater Perdurabo for his next book), a certain vehemence of passion, a sense of humour rare in philosophers, and a determination not to be too e asily understood. “Adepts,” we learn, “have praised silence; at least it does not mislead as speech does.” Frater Perdurabo howls aloud. That, I suggest, is a mistake. Page 5 of his book is occupied only by a mark of interrogation: a mark of exclamatio n is alone in the middle of page 6 . Perhaps we may take these pages as promises of an improved method. A more silent and so, in the view of “adepts,” a less misleading guinea's worth might well be made by a development of the hitherto neglected occult me anings of spaces of blank paper, and the wonderful signs constrained usually by “the slaves of reason” to the servile punctuation of common speech. — F RATER P ERDITUS ."},{"pageNumber":619,"pageContent":" MORTADELLO OR THE ANGEL OF VENICE A PLAY IN FIVE ACTS BY ALEISTER CROWLEY PRICE TEN SHILLINGS NET “A little master piece.” — The Times .

The Universal Freemason , from which the obituary of Yarker in the prefatory matter was reprinted, was the jo urnal of Matthew McBlain Thomson’s “American Masonic Federation.” It is likely that Thomson himself was the author of that piece; he had previously lived in Scotland. Crowley’s Masonic title of “Past Grand Master in the U.S.A.” (see the title page of The Ship ) was conferred by Thomson, probably on Yarker’s recommendation (see Aleister Crowley: Freemason by Martin P. Starr, A.Q.C. vol. 108, 1995). Thomson was subsequently (early 1920s) imprisoned for fraud for selling bogus masonic degrees; the “American Masonic Federation” is generally regarded by masonic historians as a scam to extract money from the credulous. Thomson does not seem to have been directly involved in O . T . O . as such, although Reuss conferred an honorary O . T . O degree on him; the only time he ever met Reuss they quarrelled and fell out within a day.
