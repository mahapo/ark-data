Q: What ́s an \"Elite Family\"? A: That ́s how m ost are calling it. Families who for a long time have been ruling the people who are not from these bloodlines. Q: what ́s your thoughts on \"peak oil\" A: It is known within certai n circles that it is m anufactured. The Earth is producing more oil/gas than is being used now even believe it or not, it is a natural process \"the m ore you ta ke, the m ore it produces to balance itself\". Study the bees and the way they produce honey and you will understand. On top of that there are m any places with large amounts of natural resources which never have been touched. The agenda? I think you know."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Q: what commonalities do the bloodlines share? and have you ever fucked a child? A: Understand that \"bloodlines\" have been chosen to ru le, it didn ́t just appear out of air. The souls which incarnate into these bloodlines who rule are picked by Divine Law. Other things don ́t have to be m entioned. The second question shows you read to much Icke who is a tool that is being used. But to answer, no. Q: Sorry, OP. No one ru les me...never has! A: A little old saying: The perfect slave is the one that says \"I am not a slave\". It is like an alcoholic saying he isn ́t an alcoholic so therefor he will always be an alcoholic. Get m y drift? Q: Where do you elites store your mentally ill relatives caused by centuries of inbreeding? A: It is a m yth that inbreeding always causes problems. If the 2 persons who procreate carry genes which are of better quality than the rest.... Q: why have you allowed us to breed like rats if population is what you feel threatens you? A: 1. We haven ́t allowed that, you have more power than you think you have. 2. Population does not threaten \"us\" in any way, shape or form....again a m yth. Q by t he f orum o wner: I am curious what a member of an ́elite family ́ thinks of GLP. So what do you think? A: The m ore divided people are, the easier it is to ru le over them. Making them believe they have a sword in their hand which they think makes them powerful and able to fight \"the dark sider\" while it is just a toothpick. You have to be very careful who you give that imaginary sword to, Trinity. Do you know that not just spoken words but also written words emanate a frequency which have a direct effect? And I would say that a vast majority of the written words here are not helping the cause you think you are fighting for. Q: What is your religious affiliation? A: Religion is created by \"us\". The religions which rule now are the ones that are under total control."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"I can ́t give out to much about this but Christianity/Judaism/Islam/Buddhism are a bit off, let ́s say. There is a core of truth, but it is drowning in a sea of perversions....for you to pick out, good luck. What we believe in does not m atter but it is about serving the Divine Law which was passed onto us. Q: How about the world economy? A: One thing conspiracy theorists are right about is that it is based on money that doesn ́t exist, never existed, never will. The ones who own the banks also own the media and politics, so it can be portrayed the way they want you to believe it. Q When will the wheat be separated from the chaff? Or do you want to get rid of the wheat and leave the chaff for your slaves? Whichever, when will it happen? (tired of false dates, please be honest this time) A: I know 100% sure there is no end time, at least not like it is being portrayed everywhere, be it religion, media, etc. This place was never meant to end the way it is being described. There will be a time when everyone will be released but that is not a m ass event, but rather 1 by 1....work on yourself. Q: I ́m curious to know why the Elite do not lead? They seem to be more of a parasite on society. A: A fish in the ocean can ́t see that birds are flying in the sky. Q: Have you or any of your family members ever participated in an occult ritual and, if yes, what was the nature of it? A: Rituals have a meaning which cannot be understood by m ost. Rituals are there to connect with the higher beings who govern this realm. We are doing our job. Q: well I ́d have to say your divine law has fucked up this planet and its people very well! A: Peasants like you don ́t understand that you do it, nobody else. Btw, by what you just said you lenghtened your stay here on Earth one more lifetime....my condolences."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Q: Do you frequent the Bohemian Grove and fully participate... in cremation of care.. sacrifice to Molech ... screwing the male homosexual prostitutes... orgies ... etc.. A: Those and other similar places are for the politicians and media people, they are obligated. Sometimes a bloodline will be present but will not participate in those acts which are not the rit uals we do. Commen t from Ins ider : Accidental Stoner Those were many questions.... Most I would answer yes, some no. Don ́t believe all that \"gurus\" tell about us and you will do fine. Q: do you consider the prevalence/success of organised crime families and syndicates as a massive failure of your colle3ctive will? A: They are there for a reason. They aren ́t as succesful as they look though, they are broken. Q: Why do you continue to attempt to control mass consciousness by by spreading fear though every outlet available to you. Why not set the knowledge free as was intended long ago, the written word is spreading the wings of tru th. The sword has been given to the sheep, and the day of reconing is soon at hand. I believe in no law of divinity or hierarchy, we are all equal unto th eyes of the creator and for that must you answer in your time. The meek are inheriting the Earth presently, I pray for you. A: If that was the aim, it would be done in an instant. You do not understand what this world we live in really is. Q: I have no questions. I do however have a statement. The time of reckoning is at hand. A: It is not. Q: it goes..the best slave is one who thinks he is free. 13..ultimately it is all a matter of genes, n ́est ce pas? do you understand self­cloning? do you agree that the planet is replete with false allies and false enemies? A: That ́s not how it originaly goes....about the slave. If you read carefuly you will see."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Last question has a yes as an answer, there are also no real allies or enemies. Q: Op IF you are indeed who & what you say you are, then you will know that you and your ilk are in big trouble... Your time is short and those you belong to, who are in our space quadrant as we speak, already know it! I imagine they are a tad busy right at this moment. But of course you must keep up appearances even when you know you fight a losing battle. Personally I will be very happy to see the day... and it is coming, sooner than you think ;) A: There is no end of time. A long time ago, the people did ALMOST m anage to take over, and then bad things happened on earth to those people....what are you seeing now? Are you really living on the planet you think you are? Q: The \"higher beings who govern this realm\", do you serve them? By what names do you call them? Have you ever seen them? W here do they reside? A: They penetrate everything and they are benevolent. Q: dang insider you skipped my question about what really hit the pentagon....does that mean you aren ́t going to answer it? A: Does it m atter what hit it? Q: Too much question dodging A: I did not sign a contract which says I have to answer everything. Some questions do not need an answer and others do not m ean a thing eventhough you think it does. I will be back tomorrow. 9/2 5/200 5 Statement b y Inside r: How strange that some of you who tal k about love, light and peace are the ones who 2 sentences later cuss and ta lk about murdering others, smirking about it being soon.. Are you sure you are on the \"good\" side? And who is Natascha? For the ones who are a bit smarte r than that, ask away, I will answer the way I choose to. Before you ask the question, force yourself to think outside the box that was created for you by others...ask a real question that you thought about, formulate it in detail. For the others, if you could leave out cussing, hate, bigotry and prejudice (which is based on"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"your gurus ́ amazing wisdom), it would show you are a bit m ore evolved from the peasant stage. I will not answer all questions, sometimes because it is obvious if you think about it or parts of it have been answered, other times because I do not have the obligation to do so. Q: so is bill gates more elite than you? how about queen elizabeth? are you an arab? can ́t you control the oil instead of the arabs? A: The ones you know the names of are not true bloodlines like you have been ta ught by theorists. They are not the ones who write the symphony, neither conduct it. The ones you mentioned and other known names merely play the violin or cello when they are told to, the way they are told to. It does not matter what race I am, has no effect on anything. Oil is already under full control like all natural resources. Q: Why does visualization work? A: It does not work for everybody, you have to reach a certai n stage in your development. This means living by strict rules, applying them to everything you do in life, in detail. Most humans do not have the discipline nor temparence to achieve that stage. Some here ta lk like they can, but I know even without knowing anything about their lives that they are further away from it than they think. \"Visualisation\" works because it is an essential way of the creational process in this m aterial universe. The Universe is a living entity who uses it ́s Mind to create and the beings created from that may have that same power to within their boundarie s. Q: Now the question is, who is using Icke? and better question... Why? A: Icke has a core of truth he is trying to pass. What he does not realise is that this actually works against him. The reptilian part was fed him by the ones who work for the bloodlines. In a period of 7, 8 m onths he was bombarded with \"victims\" who witnessed shape­shifting, satanic rituals, etc. in such a way he could not refuse to not believe it. Sometimes the \"witnesses\" were lead to him a few times a day, depending on his location. Others like Icke (and there are more than you think) have been fed similar stories. Really, I am not reptilian. The answer why does not have to be answered. Q: Hello Insider! Are you part of the Divine Brotherhood? Are you M E? Are you he who manipulates the M atrix? Enquiring minds want to know, cuz I ́m thoroughly confused. You say we despise you, but I could not"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"imagine despising any Being from the Devine Realms! Then you act like your part of the \"elite bloodline\" on Earth, but what would bloodlines have to do with the Spiritual world? Again...I ́m confused. Could you clarify? Just what IS the Elite of whom you say we despise, and yet who apparently has all the \"inside scoop\"?? sigh Sammie A: You are confused for you have accepted the other versions of the \"truth\" and you think you have a sight of the big picture, but what I say dismisses huge parts of it. There is a misconception about bloodlines....obviously, the questions that are being asked here prove that. But there is a reason for that, and it serves an importa nt purpose. We m anipulate this world only as far as we are allowed to by the Divine Law. We provide you with tools and then it us up to you to determine how you use it. Tools can be used in a m aliscious way but noone is forcing you to use them that way....you are choosing yourself. So despising the ones who provide you with the tool that you voluntarily chose to \"sin\" with is about you trying to camouflage your tracks. You get what you deserve, that is how this universe works. We do our duty, so do yours. Q: There is a very old saying...unrecorded in open history­­\"the devil doesn ́t know he ́s the devil...he thinks he ́s God.\" A: Wrong. It actually states that humans who worship the \"bad\" think they worship the \"good\". Q: \"You do not understand what this world we live in really is.\" Care to elaborate on this statement...? Regards, Further Considerations A: Only if you form ulate the question and understand that certai n questions need to be answered by yourself only not others, otherwise they have no purpose. Q: Hey 13 ­­ I ́m not coming back to your planet next time. Smoke on that. A: What gave you the impression that when that time comes, you have a say in that? Q: What is the reason that your people came to this planet? A: Almost the same reason you came."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"Q: Now, what \"elite\" family does anyone know well enough to \"despise\"? Dubya, is that you? A: To clear this up once and for all....the Bushs are not bloodline.....in fact, they are your kind who wanted to be worshipped by your kind. I will sum it up again in short, the ones that have known faces/names are not directly bloodline. They are not the composers/conductors, they just play the flute the way they are told to. Bushs, Clintons, Sharons, Arafats, Hitlers, Dalai Lamas, M andelas, Blairs, Gores, Chavezs, Ghandis, Kennedys, Lennons, Dylans, Einsteins, M ichaelangelos, Popes, Ceasars, Aristotles, Herodotus, Akhenatons. They all p lay/played their part the way they are/were told to. These people who love recognition and praise of your kind would not be allowed to be in the same room with some people I am related to. Q by f orum owner : Insider, Rather than give them a sword (or a toothpick), I give them a canvas and a pen. The words as you say have vibration and effect. And though yes many that are written here are contrary to the ONE, some ring true. It is those few, that matter most. I was recently asked by a frie nd of mine, \"what do you do when you have mastered the game?\" This seems like a question that would apply to one in your situation as well. My answer was, \"save as many as you can\". I am curious to know, W hat is yours? A: If it has an immediate effect it is not a canvas and a pen anymore but a sword...an imaginary one but nonetheless a sword. And it is not working the way you think it does. You say most are contrary to the O ne and that is true, in fact almost all is contrary. But you say because of the few that ring \"true\" it is worth it. You cannot have 2 contrary essences at the same time/place eventhough they may have the same spring. Which means one of the 2 is not present here....do I have to tell you which one that is? About m astering the game. How does one know they have m astered it? Does someone else tell them? See, if the \"master\" is not really a m aster yet he acts like one it will mean he will make errors. He will have flawed thoughts and act accordingly. People will start listening to him and adopt the flawed opinions and way of living.....eventually he will do more harm than 1 bloodline actually has the power to do personally. Hence why \"leaders\" have been created for you who \"have mastered their game\". Jesus of Nazareth is a nice example. He was created, this human has m any worshippers and they have m urdered in his name and still do (Bush). Jesus of Nazareth was not a master of the game, he was a puppet being used in the game and he"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"still is serving the agenda among you. So you m ight think you are saving as many as you can like him but are you really? How would I answer the question \"what do you do when you have m astered the game?\" Checkmate. Q: Is Earth a prison? A: Yes and even worse. The ones who believe the contrary will never escape. Q: Why, oh why would an alleged member of an \"elite family\" waste one minute minute of their time, or give credence to the cespool that is GLP? A: Bloodlines are not robots who all act the same. You are confusing the ones who you think control you with others. Q: Now on the population reduction... We have a few brewing like AIDS... however, it has been my feeling that the \"release\" of a bio, will be in a timely fashion cloaked in chaos from another event. What say you on that? A: There is no plan to reduce the population, that is fully in the hands of the people. However certai n events have been seen as just that while they are servi ng another purpose....a misconception. Just because it comes across like population reduction does not m ean it is exactly that. Really, if the goal was population reduction, it would have been done a long time ago in a span of a few weeks. In fact the opposite is more true in m ost areas on this planet. What you said could happen but it would be done by the ones who control the lower areas. The ones up higher do it through the daily items you consume. Q: Was Yahweh an extraterrestrial negative entity? Or was he a fiction invented by the Jewish fantasy factory during the time the Greeks ruled Palestine? A: If the name of an entity is public, it means it is fabricated. Yahweh used to represent an age where m ass­control was ta king shape. Q: Ah, so Mormons are the on ly ones who are bar kin g up t he r ight tree. Author ity and all t hat. A: No. Q: 1). Don ́t you get sick and tired of the lack of real quality in the Music and the Movies? With your power/money/influence why do you not prime the pump with some really good stuff?"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"2). What are the three things that have you concerned about most regarding the upsetting of the applecart?

Please list the major player groups who actually answer to each successive level beginning from the top down. Descriptions are fine if you don ́t want to divulge names. Is it like a pyramid, or is it a number of factions vying for power/control? 4). What is the real story on the greys and are they still major players currently? 5). What do you fear the most? 6). What is the real story you haven ́t told us because we haven ́t asked yet?? A: 1. The ones who search hard will find the gems in Music, in fact they are out in the open. It is not our duty to enlighten you, that is yours. We hand out the tools that can be used in the way you choose to, \"good or bad\". 2. Nothing to do with us but with the puppets. 3. The shape of a Pyramid yes, but people forgot the underground chamber. The Top of the Pyramid is not the top. 5. Fear is based on physical impulses, the physical is not importa nt. Q: My full­blood Italian maternal lineage traces back to King Charles I (Charlemange) but by name, Count Dotto Dotti who was the captain of the archers for Prince Phillipe (King Charles IV) and who was part of the coup to secure the ́secret ́ from the M erovingians and the Knights Templar. I won ́t discuss the secret, which I am sure of, but I don ́t understand why you operate in the fashion that you do and I operate in the fashion that I do then as a result. This does not mean that I am of any particular bloodline that is part of the ultimate that you speak of, but my life is far more progressive than anyone that I know scientifically and professionally regardless of the economy (change thereof coming shortly). And I do see the ́illusion ́ all around me. Explain this please. A: I have explained it a bit. Your lineage is not what you think it is. Charlemagne (like other \"kings\") merely played the flute, like his descendants do now in politics especially. However if there are traces of the lineage within you (and this goes deeper than just blood and genes as you know) then obviously you will understand your surrounding better than others. There are people who are directy linked and they will act differently. Q: Do you think Insider that This current battle is in two stages. Now, on the etheric . And, a thousand years from now, on the astral, once all the HEart people have dropped their physical bodies and HAVE GRADUATED TO HIGHER LIFE FORMS, THE NEXT BEING THE ASTRAL. Then, The whole show starts all over again, with different players. A: You are confusing a few matters. There is just 1 struggle and it is now, here on this planet and on a personal level....meaning you only. There is no enemy you can attack except yourself."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"If you are busy attacking something else, you are wasting precious energy and you will fail. If you succeed, there will be no struggle anymore. Q: Dear Insider, You state that we have the tools to work with. Can you tell us some of them, something to work with so we may free ourselves? You agree that we are on a prison planet. I thought more like a Zoo, where we are being observed and studied. But if we are on a prison planet, than I must understand that we truly have no free will. Correct? Thank you A: The tools are in your hands, around you, everywhere...it is even being drawn out of you. It is your duty towards yourself to reveal them to yourself and then do as you please with them....there is always a consequence. Prisoners still can determine what they do in their prison with the tools that were provided to them, they can decide how to walk in the yard, how to tal k, think... You have free will therefore you suffer and are aware of your suffering. Q: Dear Insider, Thank you for answering my first two questions and your time. I should have asked this question with the first two, but alas I do now. W hy give me tools to escape a prison? Sounds counter productive to what a prison is for. I have known that the PTB are puppets moved around by hands that we cannot see, nor may ever see, but why make them look and act (seemingly) stupid or at the least illogical? Are you wanting a revolution? What you are saying is that the war is within ­ not without ­ though TPTB seem to want us to think it is without ­ why distract us? What is it that they don ́t want us to accomplish? Freedom? And yes, I am reminded everyday of my suffering. Thanks A: We are neutral and doing our duty which m any times comes across as being negative. If you observe closely you will see we m erely spreading the tools which can be used by you to free yourself or chain yourself, your choice. The Divine Law has a purpose for you and it is not on this planet. Prove you are worthy again to be released. The distraction is part of that. It is about knowing who is and who is not. The ones who support any of these known faces are failing. Q: It sounds like you are cautioning Trinity against giving full reign to freedom of speech? Is thi correct? A: He may do as he pleases and accept the consequences in the bigger picture. Q: What is your interpretation of the Divine Law and how can I make peace with myself? A:"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"Knowing yourself and where you really are, are the 2 most importa nt issues that you should be involved with. It is your task to find out. In fact, if someone gave you the correct answers, it would not mean a thing to you for they would not be attached to you in a way they would if you would have found them yourself.

Statement b y Inside r: Insider/AC 13 again, yet another proxy....the last one disappeared too right after posting. It is getting difficult for m e to enter and stay here but I will go on as long as possible. Q: Question to the insider (AC 13): Are you familiar with the Black Nobility? I have traced and linked all ancient royal families of Europe and the M iddle East still present to this day. I know their names and their connections to power, wealth and influence across the world. I can even identify the very person who is the potential Anti­Christ (he has all the correct makings ­ a wonderful, benign young man who has yet to realize his full p otentiality a s a world leader). The Black Nobility love this young man. And lastly, are you a small part of the Black Nobility, Insider? A: The Dark Nobility is a faction which operates on their own, they have different roots which have been described in texts written by m y ancestors. It is a m uch smaller group than m ost would claim, because the core is different to the \"outer walls\". They are the ones which you all confuse with my kind and therefor direct the hate towards the wrong ones (as shown in this thread too by the lesser intelligent). About the Anti­Christ....there are at this m oment literally billions of Anti­C hrists. I am not one. You will find them among Christians, Muslims, Jews, Atheists, Satanists, Agnostics, Buddhists, Hindus, etc. They don ́t need a leader to be m ore Anti­Christ. I have to m ake clear that The Christ has nothing to do with Jesus of Nazareth, that part was later fabricated."},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"Q: Gnostic number 13,do you subcribe to the view,that our dualistic reality provides excellent opportunities for souls to develop unconditional love,so they may transcend our dialectic universe,rather than escaping from it? Do you also believe in the law of balance and karma,allowing a soul to be king in one lifetime,a beggar in the next? If so,it doesn ́t really matter whether you ́re a member of the elite,it may be a unique experience on soul level,as unique as any role in society,as long as the soul progresses. Is the historian Laurence Gardner a powerful member of the elite as Icke claims,or is he just an average guy with access to hidden inform ation? Thanks for your communication,Insider.(hope this thread isn ́t a practical joke by some juvenile person.Trust you ́re for real) A: It is the task of every soul to accomplish that while in this human shape. There is a part that can be called escaping which will be followed by transcending....if failing, reincarnation. However the word \"love\" is m isunderstood....it is not meant to be the love in human term s which humans are enslaved by. That is the corrupt version of the real one. The Divine Law controls what is called karma, but it is much broader and \"harsher\" than people want to accept. Example: someone who gets cancer and dies a slow painful death deserves it, that person is being corrected, it is for his own good. Sounds \"harsh\"? That ́s the way it works. Just because it comes across as negative in this realm does not m ean it is negative in the big picture. What you are ta lking about (reincarnating into the opposite of your former life), there is no universal law which states that will definitely happen. Reincarnation is a fact though, but if you achieve your task there is no reincarnation, no need to experience all levels of life on Earth for they are mainly pointless to experience. Gardner is one of those persons who wants to be praised and recognised by the people, so he gets it in return for some favors (spreading m isinfo which here and there contain the facts, which hooks people). He was initiated in certain levels but it is not as in depth as one would think (including himself), he is clever though. He is a m ember of at least 6 \"societies\" (although 3 of them are closely linked and could be seen as 1, so 4 at least) but these have only as m uch power/control as you the people give them. People like Icke are giving them more power unknowingly. I am real. Q: Is this because Christians teach that individuals should be under the control of a God who is holy? Or should I say, one who judges right and wrong? A: Christianity is about idolising a human called Jesus of Nazareth first, which is an abomination. Christians teach what they have been told to teach by the ones they oppose. I can tell you who the 4 individuals were who wrote the Hebrew old testament and the exact date, if it suited me."},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"Same about your new testament which was gathered by 6 people from 2 different areas.

The Divine Law is the manifestation of the Will of the Superior O ne which not only creates everything that exists within this universe but also m aintains, nourishes, balances, energises and renews it.

If you are doing something which was not allowed or doing a ta sk which was not given to you, you will suffer during these rituals. In your daily life you will notice it too.

It is a \"sin\" to worship/idolize/praise humans who were part of this planet in any way, shape or form, including when talking/writing about them. You by adding those letters in brackets have just done that, elevating his name up to that of higher beings. A human is corrupt while on this planet.....each and single one of them. A \"death\" does not change the personality one had and leave behind here, do not feed it. Praise and prayers may only be offered to perfect beings. Muhammed was like Jesus, M ozes, Abraham, Buddha, a human who was lead to believe he was a knower, or like mentioned earlier \"master of the game\". It is very easy to make humans believe they are enlightened and know the truth...and then thinking it is their task to wake up others. He was used and his legacy is still being used to divide people, just like the other religions/ideologies/\"philosophies\". 2 of his closest assistants were servants of the bloodlines, 1 of his wives was too (bloodline servants were also assistants of Jesus, Buddha, M ozes, name them all). After his death it was made sure by these 3 that his followers would be divided which was the main thing Muhammed was told to be against. So Muslims who believe in seperate streams of Islam are actually rebelling against their own \"prophet\"....and that would be pretty m uch all Muslims. The kuran has a core of truth but it is floating in a sea of perversions, together with the other \"holy\" books. It was written by 4 individuals from 3 \"countries\" 1 being western, 2 middle­eastern. Q: Insider 13 are you Antichrist? A: Jesus of Nazareth is not the Christ, nor is anything I have said Anti­C hrist. The ones who claim the opposite are. Q: So, is a family where the children are naturally born with this ability *viisualization*, part of the ́bloodline ́? A: No. In fact someone who has no connections to these families whatsoever can have this ability too. This ability is there for everyone to receive.....you have to dial in. It is being provided by the Divine Law to everything that searches for it."},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"I tried to make this clear earlier.....the blood/genes/etc are not as importa nt as they seem. The physical realm is weak and it cannot affect the Divine.

Certa in individuals get born into the bloodlines to be able to reign over the people under certai n circumstances, that is what the bloodline m ainly is about. Q: To me Elite means those who place money before people or any real values at all....and those who hold office either because they can buy it or inherit it regardless of whether or not they are qualified. A: You just skillfully described your kind, not mine. Q: are you a Rothschild? Here is my question, although petty in light of the many questions posed to you on this thread, why aren ́t the any of the Rothschilds listed in Forbes top 500 richest people. A: If you read closely you would have not asked this question. The ones who are known in public are not in control, the Rothschilds are at the same level as your Knights Templar ancestors were....you shouldn ́t be proud that you are from that lineage by the way. These known families/clans/societies are merely dancers to the tune. But to answer your question, no I am not a Rothschild. Which family am I from? Most here tal k about the bloodlines who rule, yet they do not know who they are. They wrongly assume they are the Bushs/Clintons/Rothschilds/etc. because some theorists \"researched\" it and some \"insiders\" told them by providing evidence. I am from a ruling family whose name rarely has been mentioned in history, noone will even know who we are. Second, you accepting Forbes as a reliable source for these kind of lists shows you are easily manipulated and do not grasp what is happening. Q: Worthy ....an interesting word. Are you expecting those of us who know about the world of polarity and try our best not to play the polarity game, to believe that we need to be worthy? In whose eyes? It can only be our own. Whatever happened to the idea that ́the Universe is within us ́? Gaia and all other dimensional ́realities ́ are Illusions, No? So the prison is an illusion, right? p.s. Baby, and btw, we DON ́T HAVE FREE W ILL ON THIS PLANET....perhaps you slip is showing? A: Do you know who manufactured this new age nonsense you just promoted? If this prison is a \"true illusion\", get out then right now, I dare you. It is not like in the movies. You play the victim part.

If so ask again. Refrain from asking the same questions over and over again, first check the thread, check my answers, I do tell about areas which were not asked about but may have been on your mind, read carefully. Q: ...and if these beings are LUCIFERS...????? answer in 5 words or less, pleze A: You used 12 words and 1 number, without realising it you started a part of a ritual...are you a \"being of lucifer\"? Different beings have different characteristics which makes it easy to identify them during rit uals. If it was a \"malicious\" being guiding me, I would not be ta lking in the way I do. Someone who is lead by \"malicious\" forces cannot utter/write certai n words, phrases without it affecting him. The ones who are lead by them also cannot accept hearing/reading certain things without getting overly mad/agressive (see the thread for examples). This is when \"malicious\" beings are present: Everytime you cuss, talk negative, plot a scheme, get violent, utter lies, support murder, get sexually aroused, get afraid, get jealous, even laugh out loud, being overly joyfull (so all related to emotions/passions/desires), they appear near you.....one, two, three, or m ore of them. \"Malicious\" beings are from this realm, this is their home. You cannot hate them for they are doing their task, their rightful duty and it is connected to your behaviour....understand, you are the perpetrator, they react. They never instigate, you do. If you do hate them you are m issing an importa nt part of the reality....respect them up to a certai n point. This will also show you are conscious about them and that will be recognised. I type \"malicious\" because they are not malicious, they only appear to you in your manufactured perception to be so. People are perpetrators who play the victim part. Q: 1 How does real conciousness interface with this prison? 2 W hat are the techniques to break the hold of the interface and \"free\" the conciousness? A: 1 + 2. Depends what is meant by real conciousness and interface, from where I stand they could be almost the opposite of what you m ay m ean. Real conciousness is what is provided to you when you are in tune with the M ind of the Universe which operates according to the Divine Law (they are not the same like many are lead to"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"believe). This Mind penetrates everything, it rules over everything, so if you would connect with it you may experience it ́s unlimi ted power. No prison can confine this power, hence there will be an escape, you will be guided up to a certai n point, yet most work is to be done by you. But that is just the beginning, m uch work lies ahead concerning yourself. I have explained a few times as far as I am allowed to how to connect, at least how to start with it. It truly is up to you. I would hesita ntly add that studying ancient texts will help (although a lot is filled with perversions and wrong translations, intentionally) but this only after a certai n level of awakening, you will recognise/remember the small parts which are true. If you are not on that level you will take parts of the perversions/wrong translations as the truth (as a few show it here, especially 1 religious stream) and fail. Q: Care to tell us which it is? You some sorta good guy who gives up tools or do you ru le over us?? DId you change your mind or what?? A: Neutral means in the term s I used, neither negative nor positive, merely providing the tools you can choose to use as you wish....you are the perpetrator. Or would you say I control every aspect of your life, every hour, every minute, every second and force you what to think/say/do? Do not be mad at the wrong individual. Q: Is it necessary to know why we are here to escape, or just work out where we are? Are the answers to be found \"inside\" or by \"joining\" soocieties, or by appealing top divine intervention, or all three?, or none. You have answered no other of my questions, I hope I have not offended A: It is necessary to have a view of the whole spectrum, when it is partial it will be like looking through the window while it is partially covered with a curtain. You do not know what is behind that covered part therefore cannot act accordingly. What covers the whole spectrum? Understand this place, what and where it is, know what you are, how you came here, why you came here, how to return. Prepare yourself for the answers, cleanse yourself, reach out for the M ind, speak (within­\"with­ out\") that you are ready, live strictly according to the answers. Do not join \"secret societies\", never, whatever the circumstances are. Also no religions, including the new age, do not accept human gurus/prophets/priests/rabbis/imams/popes/fortunetellers/\"mediums\"/dalai lamas/politicians/authors/scientists/\"celebrities\"/parents/etc. as legitimate authorit y on Divine matters....on other m atters it is your choice to accept or decline, however accept the consequence.

Q: So, what are your comments on NESARA/PLANET X/POLE SHIFT/FIRST CONTACT/SECOND COMING? Who or what is behind these fairy tales and why? A: NESARA: counterproductive to you personally in the long run. PLANET X: does not exist anymore like so many planets, moons, stars, galaxies. Their demise however always brings forth something, which m eans they never stop being part of the whole, playing their part. POLE SHIFT: it happened 2 times to m y knowledge, in the 2nd and 3rd era, if necessary it will be done again. SECOND COMING: you returning back to where you belong after you have succeeded, which means a second coming cannot take place on Earth for you do not belong here. People who are waiting for a \"saviour\" on Earth to do all the work for them are all failing. I have noticed some Christians have gotten angry and are attacking me on a personal level by damning me, it is their choice. I tal ked more about Christianity than other religions because the questions gave room for that. I would say and have said similar things about the other religions/ideologies when asked about them. Q: What interests me is this: if someone takes the time and trouble to follow up the leads and clues left in numerous books and legends, and sorts out the wheat from the chaff, what then? If that person puts into practice what they have learnt, do they come closer to the truth that the bloodlines evidently have access to? A: Yes. Again, the bloodline is only importa nt for ruling over people, it is not about having a special power that m akes one more aware, although the knowledge is being passed on so therefore it appears like that. But this knowledge is not hidden, the Truth cannot be hidden, It wants to be known by you, inviting you every m oment of your life.

Are you in any way related to the Bird Tribes mentioned in Ken Carey`s Starseed Millenium books? Is there much truth in the writings of Sheldan Nidle of http://www.paoweb.com/ ? A: The Native Americ ans have preserved knowledge succesfully but nowadays (and the last century orso) it is being presented in an erronneous fashion. Integration is \"working\". About the authors mentioned; like I posted before it is not in your interest to accept human intervention/advisors/salesmen between you and the Divine. They may say certai n things which are true, yet it will n ever be complete. Q: Noone on this earth has the power to \"free\" any of us. Noone outside this earth sees a reason to free any of us. The divine source itself (if there is such a thing) is waiting for us to free our own selves, individually. There will be no \"mass ascention\" no \"mass enlightenment\" and \"we the people\" have all been duped by \"we the people\" into prolonging our sentence here. W e can stay here in this place for eternity if that is our choice, and we have created a belief system that allows us to do so. A: I would leave out the sentences \"Noone outside this earth sees a reason to free any of us.\" and \"(if there is such a thing)\". About the first sentence, there was a time when there were beings who had the power to do it but that was not their task. And The Divine Source IS....there is no \"waiting\", \"wanting\", etc. You are on the way, the other post showed that too, but living it is an importa nt part of the task. Q: And by Divine Law, Christ was sent here to correct the situation. A: Yes, but Christ did not descend into the body of a human called Jesus of Nazareth, 2014 years ago on M arch 20th, almost 2 hours before sunrise (which is the secret time of birth of your \"son of god\"). The Christ (which has a different \"real\" name but I will use this name here) appeared once, just once, and this was in another era, not even close to our era where Jesus of Nazareth also lived in. Do you know who keeps the knowledge about the real Christ alive? And do you know who keeps the knowledge about the fake christ(s) alive? The opposite of what you are thinking.

It m eans that subconsciously you have disattached yourself from that lineage (eventhough consciously you m ay not, this is importa nt to understand). You have passed a certai n level which I did too almost 11 years ago. 2. You excelling in certai n areas is not just genes, they have a bit different purpose. It is about what I mentioned above. Il vecchio sentiero è vicino *The old path is near* Commen t by Ins ider: Oazaki / Hiko Seijuro / Aiki­Mei, Before accepting a certai n knowledge, you have to investigate where it comes from.

Knowledge does not just appear out of nothing, it is passed on, always...there are no exceptions. Q: And, you ́re part of an \"elite family\", that we despise, yet, no one has ever heard of you?

How can this be, if the \"tru e bloodlines\" are the names and faces of people we do not know? Is it more the nature of your presence we despise or the position you take in life we despise? And, if that is so, then do all people despise you or just those who do not know or understand your tru e intent and/or nature? A: Last time I will answer this one. It is about the misconception about who rules. Terms are being used which do not apply to m y family yet they are part of the ruling. The flawed perception of the nature of the presence and the flawed perception about the positions which lead to affecting the lives of people...again, you are in control. One cannot despise others because of one ́s own lack of understanding about the m atter, yet that is exactly what happens. I.e. wrong ta rget, wasted energy.

Is M oroni, who is mentioned in the Book of M orm on really an extraterrestrial from the Pleiades and are such beings still interacting with humanity at present?

Nothing is easier than to write a best­seller book/hit album/movie script if you know what the highest promoter ́s agenda is. Morm ons are like the other religious people controlled by the ones who controlled their \"prophets/sons of god/angels/saints/etc\".

Also it could be a deceiving beginning of something else which many people experience.

Q: they include the sheik in the desert whom Jesus encountered during his travels and from whom he received a blessing. Would you happen to know anything about that? A: I know some people which Jesus of Nazareth \"happened to encounter\" were insiders. The 3 kings being the first right after his birth, which were actually 5 but 2 were present in the background (the number 3 in the story serves a symbolic purpose like so many things, read slowly). The gifts were the symbolistic artifacts (some ancient) which through rituals would initiate him into his chosen task, for this he needed to travel to certain places. I have said a few times and I will repeat for the last time, he was not the real Christ, he was made to appear like one by being guided throughout his life up to his death, and after that, the documenting of the words (which started long before his death, although rewritten again at a later time to release). The 5 kings were present too during his crucifixion and Jesus of Nazareth knew, he would have responded differently if they were not there. Jesus of Nazareth was always aware that he was being guided by them, in fact he sometimes actively searched for them and other insiders. He gave up on 2 occasions but was guided back. Q: The ́Elite ́ are making it (oil) look like it is being constantly restored, but are actually storing it. I`d appreciate your thoughts on this. Candace Frieze`s writings A: The Earth is storing it untill they get used, the ones in power just tap into it. Although there are some factions (above the puppets) and they are responsible for the misconception most have which you described together with the statement that the resources are disappearing. It is the way I described in the form er post. The writing has some errors. 1. The Annunaki are rulers from a different era, they are gone and replaced by others. 10.000­15.000 years from now (yes, the Earth will be still alive) people will find texts about the rulers of this era thinking it still applies to theirs. Those texts have been written for the major part already. 2. If what was written in this text was true, it would mean that at the moment the Earth, \"star"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"friends\" and Angels would be now rebelling against the Divine Law of the One.....which is an abomination to even suggest (I had to be very carefull h ow to articulate that to not fall into the trap too). If the person who wrote it does not restore it, she will a chieve the opposite of what she desires and taking many Souls with her who accept this. Again accept no human intervention between you and the Divine. 3. The struggle is on a personal level, that m eans you only can do it, do not wait for \"saviours\". Q: My only question now: Is it really THIS simple? I will not give away what you have knowingly or inadvertently revealed... I know now that what you say is tru e: This cannot be told, it m ust be discovered, for it has no power if it is revealed to one. Is this the reason there is so much secrecy? Not so much that people won ́t find out because it is an \"just for the elite\" but rather, that if they happened to be TOLD it, instead of discovering it they would never have any chance of escape? A: The Truth wants to be known by you, it is It ́s main goal, inviting you every moment of your life, so to be understood by you It is out of Necessity simple and to be noticed relating to Providence It is \"in front of you\". The last question has a yes as an answer. If you did find It, thank the Divine Law, nothing/nobody else. The journey just started, long path.

A force that does NOT want people to \"be all they can be\"? If so, what is the best way to deal with it in your experie nce. A: It is connected to the operations of your physical body which rebels everytime you reach higher to that realm. Physical body has the task to let you experience this reality and whenever you search for the other, it resists. It is it ́s duty so respecting it and gently ta ming it is the best approach. Also beings will accompany your thoughts and try to divert them, again it is their duty, show respect and that will be recognised by them.

It does so because the Soul is conscious of what it has been born into and is in a state of disbelief (you are m ore conscious of what you are and where you are during/right after birth than you are now). The Soul m akes the body cry because it is the first time it came to this physical realm (although this is a very limited number) or because it realises it has returned through reincarnation, after failing in the former life (which is a vast majority). The Soul itself is not the one cryi ng (it is unfamiliar with these functions in it ́s original state) yet the impulses it gives m akes the body cry. It cries \"without a reason\" for days, weeks, months, untill the consciousness has lost it ́s power, be it through natural processes or the influence of parents and these days even m edication...

This will have an impact which will influence them for the rest of their lives, subconsciously. The time of birth was determined (as is the time of passing on), together with the enviroment, parents, circumstances of birth, health, etc...nothing is a coincidence. But during puberty they get cut loose from certai n strings and they will be fully responsible for their actions, having the free will to lead the life they want, they determ ine the quality of it....they can even determ ine the way they pass on (\"death\") by the choices they make but cannot change the time of passing on. Just a few areas of their lives will be influenced by the tools that the parents have given them. Most of the child ́s life will be based on free will, which will have very little to nothing to do with parents, you are only importa nt in the first 5­6 years of the child ́s life so that is where you can do most good. Use your intuition (not instinct, 2 different matters). When becoming a parent you are rewarded with qualities (which concern raising children) which where not available before, listen to them. Every child is different, respond differently but m ake them aware there is more than they"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"experience, that there is a Good Source where everything/everybody flows out of for a reason and 1 day they will return after realising their ta sk here on Earth. Do not tell this all at once but over years and do not tell m ore than this. If done the right way they will start looking for it on their own for the rest of life, which is their duty. If you present it to them in an obvious way (like religious people do), you will achieve the opposite. Musical instruments were passed on in a different era for a reason and it was not just to listen to other people playing them. Education: 1 m ethod of manipulation (I have listed the others). They will be manipulated, but after puberty they have an importa nt opportunity to undo it. They will also get opportunities during the rest of their lives. You cannot stop the manipulation, neither instigate an awakening, that is up to the child and how it responds to the tools provided to it.....the M ind of the Universe following Divine Law is always penetrating your child so it is being provided with the chance to awake every m oment. It is up to him/her. Q: What do you know of an advanced race who were (and some still are) worshipped as gods? Do you recognize any lords or deities? A: There is only 1 race at the present, not another special race that is above the other, people are confusing different matters and eras. The O ne is worshipped/praised as what you call \"god\". The word \"god\" is a corrupt term, it would imply that you as a human would have control over the invocated higher being (like before, I had to be carefull how to phrase it to not fall into the trap m yself). I would say do not use it, but it is your own choice with consequences. The O ne has m any m anifestations/emanations/characteristics which are present in a hierarchy of beings with different workings but operating together. All are incorporeal/immaterial although some may operate bodies in a fashion different to ours, some by lowering their frequency which is actually emanating a form from themselves, may appear in the material world. All are praised for they are the One who creates the Good and they direct theirs to the O ne too. You people worship some humans as \"gods\", be it \"prohpets\", \"celebrity\", sportsmen, politicians, autors, etc. which is an abomination. Q: What do you eat? W here does it come from? A: What nature provides directly. I have a greenhouse which provides me with certain vegetables/frui t which sprang from uncontaminated seeds. I have some healthy animals which provide m e with m eat, eggs, milk. I get m y water from an underground spring. For you to know, bread can be bought at small independent backeries, especially the \"foreign\""},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"ones who do not use the same ingredients as the \"natives\", they are not free from them but better still. Some of the food/drinks sold in these \"foreign\"­run shops will be better for you than the ones sold in supermarkets. This is not how the rest of m y family lives, they have \"servants\" which provide them with their needs with the products from their own properties/factories/farms/etc. Q: Insider, what can you tell m e about Nikola Tesla? Do you think he completed/failed his ́mission ́ here on Earth? A: All knowledge is passed on, Tesla ́s was too to him, they are not his original ideas. 2 insiders passed on to him the knowledge, knowing Tesla would use it to advance the plan (which was alive then) to gain control over the energy resources from certai n bloodlines by dimishing their value with \"new\" technology. Tesla m ade it public to the wrong people and ended the whole thing. Clever individual, not so clever human. Insiders from the m inority m ust be vigilant, because of these kind of events. Q: Are ther any wholesale events on the horizon that will translate into a quantum leap in mass consciousness and/or redefine life and the way it is lived? A: No, not like that. As mentioned a few times it is on a personal level, meaning you getting selfconscious yourself through the tools available to you, I have described some as far as I am allowed to. There may be an event which would alter the way civilisation is perceived now (it happened before m any times) but that will have nothing to do with what you mentioned. Your duty towards the One and yourself still stays the same, no m atter what happens. Do not waste energy waiting for events, being generic and inanimate, your stay will o nly be extended. I might add this which may sound contrary to what I said but read carefully: When masses are m ade to believe something negative, they may create what they did not want, which is how for instance the \"NWO\" like you people name it, works. You are believing it is taking shape, so it will take shape and theorists are m ajor players in helping this taking shape by bombarding you with \"facts\" that it is ta king shape. Claimi ng you are giving in power everyday, and they control you m ore...while in reality you are in full control. So the people who are \"waking up\" to it are the ones who are creating it. Visualization also works that way around. But I repeat, even if these things would happen your duty towards the O ne and yourself still stays the same. Q: Have the husband/wife relationships of the \"higher beings\" been compromised? Have those created to be together by the One parted ways because they reject their duties?"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"If so, on which side of this rift do you reside? Is your God the Self Existent One? A: Again their is confusion about H igher Beings and the Souls in bodies be it bloodline or not. Higher Beings and Souls are different entities. Higher Beings do not enter bodies in this era (which lasted longer than you think), they are incorporeal, do not experience this world like we do. Souls are corporeal, we are in this m aterial/physical plane and experience it ́s low frequencies as reality, although we may float above it and experience the higher realm too. I should tal k about this briefly; you are not in the body but encompass/envelop it while being present in another invisible body which consists of similar elements to the Soul (which is you) yet this invisible body is entangled with the physical plane (this is very importa nt for you to understand) and connects with the visible body through energies transmitted by the invisible body to the brains, heart and areas in the spine, hence we (as Souls) may control the body and it ́s functions, m aking us experie nce this realm. Souls are dual, meaning you are also somewhere else, waiting to be united in another realm. Some bloodlines refuse their duties just like non­bloodlines do, suffering the consequences connected to it. Many bloodlines do not know either. The \"rift\" is not were you think it is, it is on a personal level, meaning m e and you too. I am from a minority within the faction which is getting smaller. I explained why the word \"god\" is not used for it ́s traps in the meaning. The O ne is Self­Existent, Pure, Good and indeed the O ne who creates the G ood. Q: Insider. Are you saying h ere that the \"old\" ways were based on truth and were cor rect? should we seek the old ways and follow them? Is being in harm on y with the \"Mo ther\" so mething we should seek? Is the Devine One mo re interes ted in our heart s or our mind s? which is st ronger? Were the teachings of Jesus regarding love a me ssage that w e shoul d pay at tention to? Are we stronger than you as a col lective? Are we im pri soned here because of our \"sinful\" nature or because of our lack of understanding. A: ­The first appearences of knowledge are closer to the Truth than the latter ones. Think of the ripple created in a pond when throwing something in it, the further the waves get from the core, the weaker they are, finally stopping. 4000 years ago is relatively young in this era. Wrong translations, wrong interpretations/additions, deletions will mislead you. Therefore search for the M ind of the Universe which will enable you to pick out the truths and later on directly pass it through. ­Being in Harm ony with everything the Divine Law is providing us with which were designed to realise our return, without interpreting it in human terms. ­The Divine One IS, there is no \"interested\", \"wanting\", etc. although It ́s emanations/manifestations/characteristics may act according to the O ne. We do not have a Mind, we may interact with the Mind which may allow us to be become one with It."},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"To have something is owning it, owning means mastering it or having it under your control at the least....we do not m aster the M ind, neither do we control It. Most confuse using intelligence with having a M ind while using the intelligence is m erely an operation granted to us by the M ind. A Soul does have different essences, it consists out of certai n \"parts­covers\" although it is 1 being. One of them could be called the H eart, that which connects to the spring of Life which keeps us alive, provided by the O ne through It ́s emanations. All essences are as importa nt. ­Read this slowly: Love, it is not to be understood in human term s, that is the corrupt version. The teachings of the real Christ are not the teachings of Jesus of Nazareth although the latter adopted m any from the former (I remember I would not mention it again but this context needs it). The Christ has a different name but I will use this term because that is what people are familiar with. The m essage was there since the real Christ revealed Itself in another era than ours. Jesus of Nazareth was part of our era. There is a difference in the way it is being spread in Christianity and it is corrupt. Without the appearence of the real Christ on Earth we would not know how to return for the Divine Law which through the Universal Mind allows us to ascend, was revealed by the real Christ. Where we are, what, who, how, why, when, all revealed by It in accordance to the W ill of the Good One and the real Christ should get all the praise, it is crucial. Not that It needs your praise, Higher Beings don ́t need us for anything in our present form , but it is a way to let it be known that you are conscious about It. You need the recognition that It grants you. ­Divinity can make 1 human be stronger in every way than all humans combined. ­What I am allowed to tell is that you are still here because of your lack of understanding. Do not think in \"us\" but \"I\". The \"us\" will come later in another realm. Q: If the \"Christ\" came in another era, why did he fail his mission? A: Be careful with what you say, you are harming yourself. The real Christ did It ́s duty fully and succesfully, now it is your turn. If you fail do not blame The Divine. Divinity is blameless in Earthly m atters. When you get sunburned, do you blame the Sun which m aintains life on Earth and beyond or do you blame yourself for laying hours doing nothing on the beach without protection?"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"Statement b y Inside r: This will be my last post, it is done. This was according to the Divine Law which is above my family or anyone on Earth and beyond. The m inority passes it on when ordered by the Higher Beings, understand this. There are 2 undesired m ovements which were known to happen to m e. I would have stayed longer, although m ost areas have been covered. I answered as m uch as I was allowed to in the simplest manner I could. I had to write fast for a reason. If you choose to: Thank everyday the Good One where everything has it ́s beginning for Being, for It ́s Divine Law providing you with a chance to return to your original state, the realm you truly belong to, for It ́s power of Necessity applying the justified corrections that you experie nce everyday. Praise the Higher Beings who operate according to the One ́s Divine Law, which are manifestations/emanations of the O ne, for providing the m eans of Life in all a reas, sustaining them and providing these means for your benefit, guiding you to the release and more. When addressing Divinity (read again) be careful to arti culate well, do not demand, tell, beg, order, suggest, ask.....which are abhorrences, just state and do your duty. Understand the questions I raised by answering you, I said more than you read, pass it on. Return."}]
