Many will ignore or dismiss its message as too horrifying even to acknowledge. This is exactly what we want: it advances the Work. (Indeed, if you are one of the rare few who do not see it thus, we congratulate you as you are probably already a Master and you are already advancing the Work.) We can state with confidence that most people will be appalled (or worse) because we have already seen it happen. We have noticed that quite a few of the brave souls who read through the original edition (which was titled The Toxick Magician), and those who helped \"test drive\" this greatly expanded version, have remarked that the first chapters seemed rather easy to take-despite our dire warnings. Indeed, it seemed to them that these first chapters seemed rather light-hearted, even amusing. And then, sometimes quite suddenly, they would remark that they felt something change within themselves, that it seemed that the tone of the book itself changed and that they began to feel disturbed-sometimes very disturbed. Whether it was the reader or the book itself that changed we leave for you to decide. You might even do this experiment for yourself: read the first five chapters or so. See if they seem \"easy to take.\" Then keep reading and see if you feel a difference, perhaps a greater sense of dread and malevolence. If you do, go back and reread those first chapters again. Do they still seem as easy to take? ~ ~ Many writers claim to be concerned with the lamentable condition of the human species and pur­ port to present the means to bring man to a \"higher state\" of consciousness or evolution or some such. Dr. Hyatt claims nothing of the sort. Rather. this book is intended as .an instruction book for the psychopath,2 the sort of person who cares nothing for the \"advancement\" of the species. 3 Much has been written about the psychopath but very little has been written for the psychopath. Perhaps the best-known is Niccol6 Machiavelli's The Prince (1532), written for the political psychopath. (Indeed, at one time we considered titling this book The New Prince: MachiaveW Revisited in homage to Machiavelli's work even though we personally despise all those in and around the political field. 4) Though (probably) not written specifically for the psychopath, Eric Hoffer's The True Believer: Thoughts on the Nature of Mass Movements (1951) is essential reading for the practitioner. We are aware of few other useful titles in the non­ fiction arena-not in psychology or even in political \"science\"-except for a few books classified in the 2 For those who wonder about the difference between the tenus \"psychopath\" and \"sociopath,'·' please note that both the dictionary and psychiatric definitions of the two words are now literally identical. This was not always so. We speculate that the merging of these two terms has been done for the convenience of those in the psychiatric and criminal justice systems so that they need only consider behavior and not internal psychological factors. 3 Though useful for aU psychopaths, this book is particu­ larly written for the group of psychopaths we consider the best and highest of all-in our tenus. We call them \"Toxick Magicians.\" More about that later. 4 At press time we saw an announcement of the release of a book titled The New Prince (Renaissance Books, 1999) by Dick Morris. It was described as a political book, perhaps intended to \"update\" the originaL 1 1 10"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"Pandemonium The Psychopath's Bible \"salesmanship\" category. Some of Robert J. Ringer'~ work, such as Winning Through Intimidation and Looking Out For No. 1 (both reissued in 1993) are particularly useful. (As Mr. Ringer so clearly points out, these are not salesmanship books at all. None­ theless, hardly anyone seems to believe him. To us, this is an indication that Mr. Ringer is a great master. One of the axioms of life is this: even if you tell the truth-perhaps because you tell the truth­ no one will believe you.] Most commonly the psychopath has been depict­ ed in a positive way only in fiction-the popularity of which emphasizes the moth-to-the-flame fascination most people have for the breed. (Though we focus mainly on movies, if you like to read you might want to keep in mind that many of the movies we mention-here and in the Appendix-were derived from books. some good, some bad. Further some useful books have not been made into movies at all; Ayn Rand's AtLas Shrugged. 1957 is an excellent example.) You can find a few comedies (mostly among older British films]; these include School for Scoundrels, 1960 and The Captain's Paradise, 1954). You can also find a few comedy/dramas (notably The Sting. 1973 and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. 1969-which may be the best-loved psychopath movie ever made], However, most works which depict psychopaths are straight dramas. Among these are such excellent movies as Point Break (in our view, one of the purest and best of its kind] and the ever­ popular Silence of the Lambs. 5 5 Silence oj the Lambs is an example of an excellent movie derived from an excellent book (Le., the book of the same name by Thomas Harris).

That is quite understandable since almost all of the world's religious and social philosophies have little use for the individual except as a tool to be placed in service to their notion of something else: \"God,\" or the \"collective,\" or the \"higher good,\" or some other equally undefinable teFm. Only rarely, such as in Zen, some aspects of Tibetan Buddhism and Hindu- story of Hannibal Lecter's earlier \"activities,\" Red Dragon, 1981 was also qUite good-as a book. The movie, however. was rather mediocre. As we go to press (1999), the long awaited third book in the Leeter series, Hannibal, has been published. Speculation abounds whether a movie will be made. It seems clear that after many years, Lecter. his liver, fava beans and Chianti are still treasured.) 6 The conscious psychopath is often seen as the most \"real\" and frequently the most sympathetic character. This is certainly true for the fictional psychopath. and is also true for the real-life psychopath much more often than most people would like to admit. 13 II"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"The Psychopath's Bible Pandemonium ism, and some schools of Existentialism, is the truly autonomous individual considered primal. To most of the world, anyone who holds himself apart from the herd (especiaLly in the psychological sense) is, at least, highly suspect and probably blas­ phemous, heretical and criminal. (Almost every defi­ nition of the term psychopath includes the word \"criminal\" as one of its key characteristics.) Who are held up to the world as archetypal examples of psychopaths? Almost without exception they are of the vio~ent criminal variety: \"crazed loners,\" \"terrorists,\" \"spree killers,\" \"mass murderers\" and \"serial killers\" are popular characterizations today.7 (\"Satanists,\" \"witches\" and their ilk get a play from time to time but haven't really caught on.) People in the political and propaganda (Le., news) businesses love examples of this kind: it gives them a golden opportunity to rabble-rouse and pontificate. Frequently they will describe the actions of these \"terrible people\" as \"incomprehensible.\" When moti­ vations are considered at all, such people are usually seen as demented, clinically insane, sexually frus­ trated, politically fanatical or incompetent malcon­ tents. Then comes the litany of assertions of \"expla­ nations\" for their behaVior-books, music, video games, movies, the Internet (or any relatively new technology), sa tanism, \"society,\" etc. , etc. a d nauseam. Historically, certain conquerors and political fig­ ures (e.g., Hitler, Napoleon, Stalin) and competitors 7 Note that all of these categories are highly stylized and serve to dehumanize the indiViduals about which they speak. This is a common-and important-methodology when referring to \"enemies.\" to \"legitimate governments\" (e.g., organized crime figures such as Jesse James, Al Capone, John Dillinger and John Gotti B ) have been characterized as psychopaths. ThiS focus on the Violent psychopath may be dramatic, but it is also rather narrow. In a sense, to isolate on figures such as these is like saying that \"Christians\" are typified by Torquemada and Jim Jones. (Come to think of it, there are millions­ perhaps billions-of people on this planet who would agree with such a characterization of Christianity. Us included.) In reality, there are many operating psychopaths who never reach the public eye. Some are never identified as such because they are so successful at what they do (Le., they don't get caught). Many more are never characterized as psychopaths because they do not exercise unacceptable criminal behaVior (remember, criminal behaVior-especially violent criminal behavior-is usually considered one of the essential defining characteristics of the psychopath) and are thus considered acceptable, even valuable, members of society. Many businessmen, lawyers, doctors, and politicians fall into this group. (It has often been said that Al Capone would have been a great success in the \"legitimate\" business world if he had not become involved in \"criminal\" activities. This should come as no great surprise considering that many of the businesses in which Capone and others of his time were engaged-for example, the sale of alcohol and other chemicals, gambling and prostitu­ tion-were then, and are today, defined as \"legiti­ 8 It seems interesting to us that many of these \"criminals\" were viewed as heroic figures by many of the people of their time. 15 14"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"Pandemonium The Psychopath's Bible mate\" or \"criminal\" only by the circumstances of geography.) Considering the amount of focus that is expended on the violent psychopath, it appears interesting to us that there really seem to be very few operating psychopaths in these traditionally accepted \"nut\" group categories. For example, according to the FBI, there are probably no more than thirty-five \"serial killers\" operating in the U.S. at any given time. 9 Also, according to the FBI, virtually all assertions of the existence of any organized violent \"Satanic\" conspiracies have proven to be unfounded. Even more significant to us, however, is the rare occurrence of relatively large-scale violent acts 10 initiated by individuals or small groups: \"terrorist\" acts like the bombings of the World Trade Center in New York and the Federal Building in Oklahoma City, \"mass murders,\" airplane bombings, etc. seem to us rather rare (and often rather incompetently carried out), 11 Indeed, with all the hype about the power, determination, organization and resources of certain \"terrorist groups,\" it seems particularly strange to us that no one has done something reaLLy 9 Some academic sources claim as many as two hundred and some claim that the number is rising. To be sure, much of the research seems rather shoddy to us. In any case, however. the whole thing seems like small potatoes, 10 This statement, of course, deliberately excludes the per­ petrators of reaLLy large-scale violence; i.e., governments. 11 Each such incident, of course, receives an enormous amount of publicity and hand-wringing, but let's be hon­ est: add it all up and there really haven't been that many incidents worldwide throughout human history; moreover, the total number of people killed in all the incidents put together amounts to less than a pimple on the ass of any minor league war. civil or otherwise. 16 dramatic: for example, setting off a nuclear bomb in Washington, D.C. Are all these \"psychopaths\" really so incompetent?12 It is worthy noting that some people have sug­ gested that, because we have written about the Violent psychopath, we are somehow encouraging such behaVior. Nothing could be further from the truth!! We wish to make it absolutely clear that we do not condone the initiation of violence to achieve any end, by anyone, at any time, in any place, in any way. For us, the fundamental rule of interpersonal behaVior is that it is absolutely unacceptable to initi­ ate violence under any circumstances. ~ Not that that's out of the way, what does the academic world say about the psychopath? Here are some \"accepted\" definitions. From the American Heritage Dictionary: Psycho­ path: \"A person with an antisocial personality disor­ der, especially one manifested in aggressive, pervert­ ed, criminal, or amoral behavior.\" [Emphasis added] \"Antisocial personality disorder\" is a technical term in psychiatry which we will soon consider. 12 Some people feel that the rarity of such deeds suggests (or even proves!) the existence of some sort of worlawide political/social conspiracy. Conspiracy theories appear to appeal to and console the human ego which longs for meaning and purpose and hates to accept that most peo­ ple really are incompetent. 17"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"Pandemonium Note that all of the other adjectives are normative: \"aggressive\" (as compared to passive and compli­ ant?), and \"perverted, criminal, or amoral\" which are all defined by what is \"socially accepted. \"13 In the U.S., The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, (DSM-rvr M ) 4th Edition, Ameri­ can Psychiatric Association, 1994 is the \"bible\" of psychiatry.14 So, what does DSM-IVTM say about \"antisocial personality disorder\"?

No doubt you would laugh (and run) if a medical doctor said, \"According to the customs of this society, you have an infection in your finger.\" But in psychiatry, this sort of diagnostic methodology is common and accepted. 14 If you've never picked up DSM-JVTM, we strongly rec­ ommend that you do so. You'll find yourself in it. You'll find your friends and associates in it. You'll find your fam­ ily members in it. Indeed, you'llfind everyone in it. In other words, from the point of view of psychiatry, everyone has a \"mental disorder.\" For psychiatry, there is no such thing as mental health, only degrees oj pathoLogy! 15 Central as this is to the definition of psychopath. we are not aware of any definition of \"rights\" in DSM-IVTM.

This book was written to applaud, encourage anci counsel the best among this wretched, sheeplik species called \"man.\" It pulls no punches, it makes no apologies, it minces no words. It applauds the rare individual who writes his own song, plays his own tune and lives his own life. In particular it speaks to a particular breed of psychopath which we call interchangeably the \"Toxick Magician,\"21 the \"Practitioner,\" or the \"Manipulator.\" The most effective of these we refer to simply and reverentially as the \"Master.\" As with all psychopaths, he (or she 22 ) recognizes the pathetic nature of the human condition and takes from it what he can.

He does what he can to 20 DSM-IVTM seems to consider Conduct Disorder more significant to the definition. 21 The (mis)spelling is del1berate to emphasize the mindful nature and quality of the practitioner. 22 For simplicity and convenience we use the pronoun \"he\" throughout this book to refer to all Toxick Magicians regardless of gender.

I ask myself why? Their answer is that by participating in the publi­ cation of this book, they would be participating \"in dimming the light of civilization.\" What they really mean is that they are horrified at the prospect of exposing the inherent hypocrisy of most human behavior. What these professionals seem unable to consider is that the light of civilization is the result of individ­ uals who are capable of inventing light bulbs and turning on the SWitches. Put another way, all that is best is the result of the aristocracy of spirit which faces the facts and refuses to become confused by the illusion of complexity. Like any patient in need of an operation r asked my surgeons (editors) to apply all their skill and knowledge toward beautifying this project. But instead of a healthy excision here and there they have concluded that this book is a cancer which must be cut out at all costs. What this means is that this book can't be beautified for it is itself the cure of the cancer which pays them. Of course, if I had labeled this book differently and had been indirect in what I said there would have been no problem. This, then, is the first lesson of this book: never say exactly what you mean if you want the cooperation of the coward. No matter how pathetic, everyone is looking out for their best inter­ ests.

They play to be safe while feeling morally superior to the winners. 27"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"Pandemonium The Psychopath's Bible Also these professionals can't handle, withoul facing a collapse of their spirit, that you call\" improve something that is not designed to bt· improved-except by radical reconstructive genetic \"surgery.\" You can toss all the money in the world into the pit of the eternal fire of stupidity and all it will do is burn.

If such things exist-and they do-they do so with the full consent and sanction of mankind. However, there are a few points that we need to get straight. First, the strong never will get rid of the weak as this would yield a poor return on invest­ ment. In fact, the strong actually help to breed the weak, because, without them, the strong who re­ mained might finally kill each other off. This would leave the world with but a few indi­ viduals separated by vast distances. If this were the case, those remaining would die of boredom. The common notion that man is a killer is much too narrow. He is simply an exploiter and controller with killing being only one of various possible game outcomes. In other words, all things being equal, like the proverbial cat and mouse, man would rather play with the mouse than kill it-unless of course he is starving to death. As long as there are other food sources, it appears that mankind enjoys manipula­ tion and exploitation as its primary species-sport. Man is the ultimate game player because he pretends that he is not playing a game at alL Nature is not horrible. Nature is simply nature and the term horrible is simply propaganda, created by leaders from the beginning of time to help control the majority of people most of the time. \"Most of the time\" is the important phrase be­ cause, without some chaos and destruction, the population might wake up to the fact that nature is not inherently horrible; and then who in hell would 30 The Psychopath's Bible III'c'd I<:aders to run their lives?

This book promotes the idea that the human species, like every other species, has its own favorite sports. Specifically, the human species loves games which are dominated by control and manipulation even if they lead to mass destruction, including the destruction of self. However, part of this game requires that we pretend that we do care, when in fact what we really enjoy is what leads up to the spilling of blood. Some people enjoy the blood a bit more than others. but I for one would rather call the game quits when I know that I have won. I am well aware that the position posited in this book will meet with a lot of resistance from the bleeding hearts of the world, but let me give away a little secret right from the beginning: most human beings (the common man) are so numb by their very nature that they are completely unaware that they 31"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"Pandemonium are playing a major part in this game (albeit n'l extras) and that, in most instances, the COmn)(111 man doesn't feel an ounce of pain from the process ul general exploitation and manipulation.

The Toxick Magician sees all appeals to ecology as futile attempts to maintain stasis. Hence, the preoc­ cupation with ecology leads to a level of destruction far greater than would be otherwise. For example, consider the cascading effects of water-saving toilets. In order not to clog them, we are now so dis-commoded that we have to shit in seg­ ments.

Now, at last. the human race has the means to make radical transformations and prOVide the race the opportunity to do away with itself in its present dead-end form.

Every human, no matter what he tells himself. knows that, simply by being alive, he has run into a brick wall in every aspect of his life. ThiS world is a world of in voluntarism, of Zombies. And the final brick in the wall is involuntary death. The power of death lies not simply in the cessa­ tion of life, but in the reality that death always feels like the \"other\" and forces most people to feel a distance between their self and their ~'here-and-now­ ness.\" Death is alienation-the final negative out­ come. This is why the housewives of the world are seen everywhere pUShing baby carriages and sipping tea as the mushroom clouds form. The Master. on the other hand, always keeps his coffin handy. Death, which we have been taught can neither be killed, endured or cured, is the ultimate wound to the self. The Toxick Magician knows otherwise. He knows that once the right forces are in play, death becomes optional. If he has the mental organization, the active will, and the stamina to exercise his power, he will have immediate control over his adversaries. This allows him to buy time. And isn't buying time our most interesting and penrerse activity? 40 iL!1 4 h clJuently the best way to gain control is through lllll'l'mtion. 1'::lC'h and every individual has almost a comical t!\"'lll'(' to see himself destroyed.

It always appears that this little something or that could have been avoided and, if we didn't wish Lo hide from the inherent ugliness of the human condition, we could have side-stepped this misery. But, remember, those who do not readily, eagerly and graciously accept this world of in voluntarism will be labeled misfits and psychopaths. As such, be prepared-for enemies are needed to blame for every \"bad ending.\" Look at the dinosaur-they might have blamed the automobile. And if you look at things perversely enough, the death of the automobile might create a species more horritying than the dinosaur. Even with horror and death aside, few can toler­ ate complete success. It leads to boredom and to the 41"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"Pandemonium final realization that we are all food within the belly of a giant monster whose final goals we only havl,; ;1 glimmer of-and the glimmer we see is not comfort ing. Thus, while man doesn't seek death per se, h(' seeks destruction as this provides the opportunity fe)J new and potentially more lively events. Destruction is the great act of control. It is the \"no\" to involun­ tarism. The fact that destruction does, in fact, lead to death is purely happenstantial. The organisms of the future will be able to destroy themselves and still continue to live. Where there exists an innate superiority or power, Toxick Magick will manifest itself. A good Student will immediately understand this once he realizes that much of what he has called \"failure\" is truly pre-potent success. ThiS is particu­ larly true when the Student can write his \"autobiog­ raphies\" with complete dispassion. Every autobiog­ raphy is nothing more than a story of destruction and decay. Whether a force is ultimately positive or negative doesn't matter, for it sets in motion other forces over which the magician has little or no control. This form of Chaos is desired since unknown results leads to more Toxicity and Chaos. Toxick Magicians have been called the \"Children Who Hate.\" And, if the truth be known, they do. They hate stu­ pidity, death and restriction. They loathe the idea of linear time. 42 5 rile public in general has no concern as to who is , Manipulator.

Similarly, consider the Christian fight against evil III Europe-which was finally victorious when all of I he \"witches\" were burned. The public concerns itself with the maintenance of its status quo (I.e., chickens) and, as a rule, the public should be helped to maintain its status quo even more intensely than it is. The heavier it gets. the deeper it sinks and the greater its fears. It can't succeed or leap to the next level of superiority. It must sink deeper and hold on more strongly. As it does this it creates more enemies while, at the same time, making itself more impotent. Do not fight the status quo or the failures which surround you. Help it. encourage it, and then help it encapsu­ late itself. Help it grow stronger and heavier. Use whatever it creates. Don't change it. simply stream­ line it a little.

This is the beauty of learning how to be an effective Manipula­ tor. All day long, every day, you can inject your will upon others by using their stupidity, their desire to be gullible and, more importantly, their need to be flattered while disbelieving what you say. People are so fearful of being controlled that this fact in itself makes them prime resources to be con­ trolled. Every subject will gUide you in how you can con­ trol them and help them become a slave to aspects of your will. For, although people hate the thought of control, most wish to be controlled. Risk, freedom and power are only words for them, Most are simply weak and cowardly. secretly waiting for some superior force to take them over. The proof is self-evident. Just look at the number of people who seek degrees in sociology and education. The comatose state of ordinary man is necessary, and every attempt to awaken him drives him deeper into security and trance. Thus, every promise to make things better is designed to make him less dangerous and more readily destroyed. Even his revolutions make him into a better slave.

One of the worst and most danger­ 1Il1n I raps is the \"food chain.\" Every good Manipulator '''Iows exactly where he is on the food chain at any 1IIIllllent in time. The concept, in and of itself, often separates the I ('al Toxick Magician from the pretenders. The food chain concept explicitly states that we -Ire in a constant process of consuming each other and being consumed by each other. There are no free I\\lnches and each encounter demands knowledge of Who is going to consume whom. Some people prefer to look upon this as trading: after all we are human, aren't we? But no, we con­ sume each other all the time, often in subtle ways, but nonetheless we live off the flesh and blood of everyone we meet. In fact, right now each of us is living off the flesh and blood of people we haven't met and others are living off of us. However, the Manipulator knows how to delve into and apply the most subtle forms of strength or weakness to accomplish his ends. One imperative technique is the ability to evalu­ ate what each person wants to consume, the style he consumes it in, and the utensils he uses. Everyone wants something, even if it is to give away something for \"free.\" Some people are so overburdened that the great­ est way to consume them is to not let them help you. By doing this, the Practitioner can create situations 49"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"Pandemonium The Psychopath's Bible in which he can get something from a persoll 1111!! they didn't wish to give.

No matter what disguise each and every person puts on, they are out for their own perception of their best interests-which includes their own self-destruction, Almost everyone denies that self-destruction is one of their primary goals, but no matter how much 50 Iii '\\' ,i,\"y II, they practice it. Self-destruction makes 1\\' loll III\"W. and possibly more interesting life forms, 11111 II db> allows people to cope with their own feel­ IltH11 III Iwlplessness. l'.Vc'ryone feels helpless in one way or another. IIC'II' IN no way out ofit, except to destroy yourself. : '.'11' destruction is control, and some control, no 1l1,lllc'!' how painful it might seem, is better than no 111111 !'tli at all. Most so-called insane people are nothing more I htlll bad control junkies. So are most drunks and Illlilids. They are very aware of how little control t.hey have l','\\l'l:pt, however, to numb themselves, create artifi­ l'Illl delusions of grandeur and, finally, to destroy IIH~mselves, And, in the process, cause pain to the world which \"refused\" them. This feeling exists only in their own imagination. I have known a number of people who attempted !4uicide and one of their prime fantasies is watching ot.hers cry over them and hate themselves for the way (hey treated the poor, dead martyr. If you were there and could have overheard some of these inadequate control junkies, you would have laughed yourself silly. And, frankly, I wouldn't be surprised that some of them, after hearing your laughter. would go right out and try it again. In the process of understanding the food chain, it is imperative to keep in mind the kind of diet you prefer. Some Toxick Magicians like different types of subjects to manipulate than do others. For example, some l1ke women while others prefer men. (I, for one, like to help women get what they wanL) However, it is imperative to keep in mind that since Toxick Vampirism is highly sophisticated and 5f"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"Pandemonium II Ii I'kille, it is important to know that SOUle \"nIt' I JlIW;I'S go on particular types of diets befo) (. til ill I~:rnpt certain manipulations or activities (\\ J rituals) .

Under certain circumstances a meat-eater mwll go on a vegetarian diet in order to heal an illness 01 lose weight. The same holds true with Toxick Magiclc Certain psychic diets (which. in this case. means tlw consumption of the energy of certain types of people). is necessary before embarking on a particular exper­ iment or project. Eat the psychic food of others which best suits your temperament and the temperament of your operation. If you are going to try a magical operation which requires immense strength, you might try con­ trolling someone you have never controlled before. However. if you fail you might find that you will need to wait a while before you have enough strength to try again. Be careful not to overindulge or overdo it. Draining people of energy can sometimes have a rebound effect. particularly if you can't stomach the results. It is like buying a puppy dog and feeling possessed by its following you around all the time. You might have been better off with a cat or a snake. Be careful of what you want. particularly if you do not know how to balance the operation. The balance of any operation counts on the mix­ ture of ingredients which goes into making up the whole meal. And, for some people, looking at a ritual 52 Tile Psychopath's Bible II It '\\'1'1 \" lll~ preparation of a fine meal is an ex­ ih III d\"vll'c to guarantee a successful operation.

You 1I1ust reward entities which assist you and punish entities which either harm or interfere with your work. When you are evaluating someone on the food chain, it is important to take into account the quality of their brain and the beauty or ugliness of their body. Extracting energy from dull-witted or very ugly people, while still energy. can cause psychic indiges­ tion. This idea follows from the old axiom: \"Be careful who you hang out With, you might become like them,\" This fact is often ignored. not only in the simple day-to-day operations between people, but in the area of Toxick Magick. Although a Master can nor­ mally offset this effect. most apprentices are not yet 53 nil"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"Pandemonium ;/ Illll/', ('Ill111gh to accomplish this, particularly if I Ill'\\' 11'(' 111IlTouncled by parasites and defeatists.

But don't build a constant shield around yourself because it might inhibit other work which you might be doing. Personal shield building is only necessary under certain conditions. Since the power of the Practitioner is a function of both natural superiority and intense practice, it is important to choose the right times and places for practice, as well as the right victims for your opera­ tions, 54 8 AN lllore people find that they are innately TOxick, 11111(' competition will tend to break out between 1'1 dl'llt loners. This is natural since, at this time in tJlll history, more people are being born with the Illh-llt. of manipulating darkness and participating in I Ill' destruction of nonnal humans. I often feel overjoyed when I find out that some worIl-out impediment to our futures-and the III t ures of the developing life forms-has been d(~stroyed, or has become so rigid that its own oper­ Idlng system is failing. For example, consider the effects of ever-increas­ Ing over-population. FOJ; normal people this is a worry because of the drain of resources. For the Toxick Magician it is a joy, particularly because it is a drain of resources. He scoffs at such notions or problems. Every problem is simply an opportunity to fuel the feeding frenzy. Groups that hate each other and wish to destroy each other are simply tools for the Manipulator. For example, the periodic \"Satanic Scares,\" witch hunts over organized child abuse, and all1V media­ events are viewed first as jokes and then as proof that this particular species has reached the end of its utility. The species is simply a resource for the latent, hidden viruses of this planet-much as this planet may be a resource for another planet. The entire process is a food chain which the Master actively supports and utilizes for his comfort and fun. He knows that everything is part of the 55"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"Pandemonium proillem and that there are no solutions 1')'(1111 I cOllvcntional point of view, He knows that milllllil die claily and millions are born to take their pJa<.:(' , III knows that the planet is alive as a stomach is allvl' it digests everything.

He knows that each mini-solution will lead to i I greater and bigger problem in the long run. r k knows that a vaccine which will save lives will, in th.· long run, actually destroy more lives or let the wrong people die and the wrong people live. Few people have the strength and fortitude to stare directly into the eyes of the future forms which are preparing to take our place, Few can stand the face of the superman. Few can bear the horrors that await and no one can stop them. Every law enacted is just another nail in the coffin, and to watch the true believer suffer and be tortured is a great joy. It feeds you. It is important to have a number of separate, independent, and different food sources to feed and maintain you, depending on your ever-changing needs. For example, I engage in \"friendships\" and dia­ logues with people who normally would hate each other, but who r use for sustenance and enthusiasm. Both Satanic cults and Christian fundamentalists are closer to seeing the truth than most normal people. Something is going on, but it's not what they think. The Beast is staring out from each pair of eyes you see. Each glance in the mirror is the story of this world-and the Toxick Magician loves mirrors. Each 56 The Psychopath's Bible 1IIIId II!'

Never be fooled by people Whll sacrifice themselves for you, Without their so-called sacrifice, they would be isolated, depressed or feel utter emptiness. Self-sacrifice is an addiction. Self-sacrificers are often closet- or ex-morphine addicts. I can't tell you how many addictions are prevented and/or \"cured\" through substitution, The number would certainly be startling to most people. The idea of \"for someone else's good\" is patently absurd, even if the victim receives benefit. People constantly confuse results with motive and it is much more comforting to ascribe mystical and altru­ istic motivations to events than to accept them as magical acts of will (the Merlin phenomenon), or ran­ dom consequences of complex interaction neucoid­ correlation matrices, If you place twelve people together in a room, certain unpredictable outcomes have to occur.

He becomes more capable than ever of consuming t lie energies and resources of that person. So, if you are strong enough, remember that no one really likes you. What they like is how you make them feel and how well you fit into their resource scheme. If a Manipulator does something for someone, he never allows himself to be totally repaid. He always wants an edge. However, he always allows his Victim to repay him to a certain degree lest the victim turn into a enemy. People are always keeping count of what they owe and what is owed to them. Few people are capable of simply taking without its finally haVing a devastating effect on their personality. However, there are some who are expert at it. I personally know of three, but even in these cases there are occasional paybacks which seem to have a random quality. None of these three are Toxick Magicians. In fact, they are excellent exam­ ples of altruists and martyrs who mostly sneak their pleasures behind closed doors and always at the expense of everyone they know-while, all the time, claiming innocence and ignorance.

The collection process can even be displaced­ that is, collected from someone who doesn't owe thal person a thing. ThiS is often caused by frustration which leads to depression or aggression. Neither state can be tolerated for too long, so the results of the frustration build and find release in sado­ masochistic actiVities which include extracting points from any victim. Note that I didn't say innocent victim, for no one alive is innocent. Everyone is involved in accumulat­ ing points and surviving, Thus, every act of survival is an act of destruction. Every breath destroys uni­ verses. We are all murderers. These sado-masochistic acts include punish­ ments dealt out both upon others and upon oneself.

At any time he is in various stages of planting, reaping, sowing, and allowing the land to rest. This is a very important model-although some prefer the hunter-gather model. I, for one, use and combine both. To be a stalker and a gatherer and a farmer is, in my view, an ideal formula for proper operation. Unfortunately, however, I leaITled some of my skills too late in life to take full benefit of them. As is so often said by psychologists and philoso­ phers, humans go through a protracted period of \"maturation\" when compared to other species. This lengthy period of being a child and under the thumb of various authorities makes the human a prime candidate for re-instituting the infantilizing process during any period of his life. For example, consider most people's response to the Toxick Platitude: \"Everything I Need to Know I Learned in Kindergarten.\" They nod their head knowingly, and smile because an authority has II.\" '1 'll '11 ,I: I J lrilliance what they had always thought .1\\;1111\\'. 1\\1, •• rt lonns of leaITling, teaching and punishment I It 'lid blllg more than forcing infantile and childish til-II II( )(lll others.

Most psychotherapists, of course, have always treated their \"patients\" as infants. As the field has driven out the few good therapists in favor of the mediocrity of the \"housewife therapist,\" the opportu­ nity for infantilization has expanded dramatically. Witness the self-righteousness, witch-hunt mentality of \"adult survivors of child abuse\" and the stylish­ ness of Multiple Personality Disorder. One of the key factors in understanding why people are so pathetic is that, during the infantile stage of development. they \"come to constant erro­ neous conclusions\" as to \"what causes what.\" In other words, they learn erroneous negotiation strategies right from the very beginning and come up 62 63"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"l\\lndemonium IVIII'I 1:'11\\ 1\\,1 II::; [OIlS about themselves, the world, 1!llii (lil'l, 1,1l('I't'onnections which they continue III U It l( I 1)(' vlcUms of until they are buried alive, Tile reason they survive at all is because of \"1111111 (J.e., most people have the same wrong concluslllll:,j Building upon wrong conclusions leads to b;lIdt which, once ingrained, are difficult if not impo~sll II, to break.

If this is not bad enough, all humans have a col lection of traumas and have learned to carry around a backpack of anxieties, I have often said of the hllman that he suffers from an auto-immune disease. He desires oblivion while at the same time loathing the idea of losing control and his occasional feelings of integrity. He can't tolerate his condition, but has no way out short of self-destruction. For man, life is a blind assembly line. Each person thinks he is free while secretly liVing out the fantasies of his DNA. His needs and resentments are so intense that annihilation through symbolic means is often his only option. He can't flee and he sees no one in par­ ticular to fight. Thus the need for SYmbolic substitu­ tions such as masochism, depression, war, enemies. and so forth. For example, there are wars on drugs, fruit flies, border invasions (illegal aliens) and even the occa­ sional revolution. There is no therapy for the human condition as death, decay, disease, detention, and dementia always force themselves on this pitiful creature in one form or another. 64 Tile Psychopath's Bible I III' '1ldlltiOIl to man's pitiful condition of depell­ Ii \\ dIll I Vl t1llerability is narcissism.

However, the German people, like any other group of people, would have felt offended if their nose was rubbed in what they had to become in order to get what they believed they wanted. The chronic process of making-and being made-the child is a technique at which every bureaucrat and government official is adept. ThiS is fundamentally how the police operate.

Often this takes the form of passive-aggressive behaViOr. We note this often in the American factory when workers sabotage the company's profit because they resent the role of being told what to do. The worker, of course, carries this home to his family where he has the opportunity to brutalize his Wife and she has the opportunity to brutalize the children and the children have the opportunity to brutalize the pets. This is the essence of the nuclear family. The entire structure of the world is a food chain of infantilizing. Everyone gets to play adult and child in various situations and many people relish any minor role of authority so they can get even. 66 Tile Psychopath's Bible t III' WilY of counteracting rebellious employees is II I 1111'111 t he opportunity to infantalize someone II H I II!

This is simply the posturing 01 Ill! insecure whose convictions are nothing more Ilulll platitudes and \"divine\" revelations indoctrinated dill ing childhood. The Manipulator has no need to express IIi convictions-unless it serves his purpose to cOlli I eli and create effects. For example, he might express the opinion t h:, I he doesn't \"believe in welfare\" while all the till!\\' letting others know how much he gives to charity. Doing this allows others to think they haw discovered who someone \"really is\" (I.e., how they really work). Letting others discover who they think you are is much better than telling them. People tend to intensively believe what they find out for them­ selves, particularly if they think You have been hiding something from them. The Toxick Magician is well aware how important it is to let others discover things for themselves. He accomplishes this by leaving clues and establishing puzzles and simple contradictions which others can easily solve for themselves. He knows that each person is a detective, albeit a bad one. but a detective nonetheless. As people get to know one another, \"great discoveries\" by the victim dispel the distrust everyone fundamentally feels toward each other. Subtly or unconsciously each person knows he is playing a role. Thus, discovering the \"truth\" for him­ self helps the person give the Manipulator more con­ trol than intended. It is important to be aware that, secretly, every­ one wants to be controlled-but in a way which is acceptable to them. Everyone wants to give away what they have-along with all the associated responsibility-as long as it is done in a way which 72 The Psychopath's Bible Ii q \"111,'\\ n'spectable to them.

The more the Practitioner hangs out with the I'ollllnon people. the more he understands the cues which they use to make decisions of trust and their Willingness to surrender control. Remember, to be in {'outrol is frequently painful for most people. This requires that the Manipulator hang out with groups from various social strata in order to learn tlleir cues. This may even mean lowering oneself to a level which normally would be unacceptable. In fact. doing this from time to time is good training, and giVing charity and alms to those one finds the most disgusting is a very good technique for building the necessary character to deal with more powerful and dangerous encounters which are sure to occur in an active career. 73"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"13 The Toxick Magician understands how pi Ill. works.

Remember, your goal is to get the victim to lose control over the irrationality or stupidity of his belief. Before performing this actiVity, however, first take dancing lessons. Dancing through the mind of a per­ son is very similar to dancing with your feet. If you can't take lessons, go to places where people dance and learn to watch them. Also learn to wa tch people while they are drunk.

This implies that there will be many so-called \"failures\" which provide the necessary lessons of how to present and preserve oneself during a failure. Another way of increasing power is through align­ ment with other Manipulators who have similar aims and goals. It is also sometimes useful to help another Toxick Magician accomplish his own particular end even if you do not directly benefit from it. In these condi­ tions, you will have the opportunity to observe from a different angle the operations of another Practitioner (and perhaps even of a Master!) Third, it is also useful from time to time to sur­ round yourself with many disciples from whom you can drain resources and energy. This tactic is especially fun if you know the dynamics among the people in your group.

Remember, always be sure to give relief at some time. Allowing tension to remain for too long a period of time can damage your resource. Relief, even if it comes through humiliation, is welcomed. It is important to reinforce the idea that the Toxick Magician is not the cause of human suffering. Human suffering is the norm. Being numb to the depth of this suffering is normal. Being unaware of the stupidity of life is a necessary defense for the survival of this particular species. The Manipulator is fully aware that anyone who accepts and adapts to this stupidity is not a member of the futures to come and is nothing more than a breeding machine for more slaves. The Practitioner didn't invent the human condi­ tion. He is only taking advantage of it by helping others get what they want. The human condition is simply slavery-a repetition of species behavior from 78 The Psychopath's Bible illl 1',\"IIt'ration to the next.

He attempts to force life to speed up the process of evolution-even if it costs him his own life-but he only does this out of choice. Toxick Magick is focused magic, and the Toxick Magician saturates the wound called mankind with his own vitality. He obtains this Vitality by consuming the energy which others are more than willing to \"give\" away, They don't want it-it is too much for them and the Manipulator knows just the right means for gather­ ing in this \"food\" and digesting it. He knows just the right temperature to store it and, best of all, he knows just how to prepare it, to make it a joyous and delightful meal. He knows that the easiest method for gathering in this energy is to help people continue to delude themselves, to help them get what they think they want. 79"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"16 17 Every once in a while, a Toxick Magician will rUll across someone who is somewhat aware of the trutll~, of human existence. If this person has the fortitude and the willingness, the Practitioner can help this person to himself become a Toxick Magician. This is a particularly problematical exercise and commitment, and is fraught with dangers and diffi­ culties. This exercise should only be taken on after deep deliberation and testing of the subject. It is imperative that the subject be tested in numerous ways. It is best if the subject is attractive in some sense, has some charisma and has an above average IQ. Having some special talent is also a good indication that the Manipulator's time will not be wasted. But these are only preliminaries. Numerous tests must be passed and many skills learned before the Practitioner can be assured that his subject is wor­ thy. However, it is also very important to keep in mind the idea of circles within circles. Everyone is of some use, especially those who hate the Toxick Magician. Everyone can't become a member of the inner circle and there is no harm in having many grades of prac­ titioners.

Also, he is acutely aware of the danger of hope in situations which have IIt:en very oppressive. He uses these devices (among many others), to Ilclp people get what they really want: more for less. He pretends that he respects the rights of people and is interested in their plights. Even though most people know that this is a ruse, they go along with the program because it is the line of least resistance and allows them to express some of their frustra­ tions. This reduces the pain of their pent-up depres­ sion and aggression. As a rule, people believe they have honor and a reputation to protect and the Practitioner can manip­ ulate their reactions by casting doubt on their honor or reputation. This can be done either by supporting or threatening them. Often, casting doubt by the method of support has the most useful benefits. The Manipulator is always aware of how much self-delusion is taking place when he is engaged in any conversation. He either helps the self-delusion along to the point that no one believes anyone any longer-thus ending the conversation by SWitching 80 81"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"Pandemonium the topic-or enhances the self-delusion just enoul',I, to inflate the person's public value.

The Manipulator is always ready to make some form of restitution for a perceived wrongdoing. Often a small apology is enough. At this point, it is often useful to talk about other people in a derogatory or gossipy manner. Give the victim the sense that you are taking him into your \"strictest confidence,\" Although there is some likelihood that you might not be fUlly believed, if the person about whom you are gossiping is in some way competitive with your victim, you will be doubfy believed. Any type of gossip establishes bonds and. secon­ darily. alerts others that they, too, might be betrayed at a later date. Thus. the Practitioner always uses gossip wisely. Often he will let the other person do the gossiping while keeping his mouth shut. Or he might say something which will be heard as gossip by his victim but which also has a double meaning which he can easily twist around if later confronted. He is expert at lying and confounding informa­ tion. Little slips and small distortions make for potentially great future power plays which, if well orchestrated, will produce excellent results. 18 While people scream about the importance of (H'lo.l justice, it interests them little unless they are II I some way harmed. In fact, the idea of social IlIslice is something about which almost everyone is II 19htened. For most people, social justice would mean ruin ~'ilnce almost everyone has lied, stolen, distorted the t I'uth, harmed others in insidious ways, and held hack favors out of selfishness. greed. or simple meanness. Thus. from time to time, someone must he sacrificed to atone for and hide the sins of the group or even an individual. In cases like this, the Toxick Magician can per­ foxm miracles. He can help any group, no matter how small, to find a victim to blame and torment. By relieVing the group of blame, he will often find them willing to provide small favors which he should take as soon as they are offered. In some instances, delaying the acceptance of a gift is the best thing to do, but not in the case of scapegoating. People want to forget this petty part of themselves as qUickly as possible. If you do a favor for someone who sees himself as honorable and reputable, be sure to get paid well in advance. These people have a very short memory when it comes to being associated with someone who might make them look bad in the future. The Practitioner is well aware that all people like to use reason and logic to help them follow and fulfill their whims. In practical terms, this means talking in moderation while always promising a miracle. 82 83"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"Pandemonium Since most people have been in a chronic st:IH.' cd hypnotic trance since childhood, it takes very lit lit· Ii. keep them asleep.

Still another method is to mention that no miracle will occur and lh~1I more effort or hard work is needed for the desire( I results. But no matter what you do, a miracle is always expected. This fact is based on a number of \"natural laws,\" the first of which is that no one has experi­ enced their own creation, and life goes on no matter what happens. All of this. and more. seems like miracles for which the TOxiCk Magician knows how to take credit. It is easy to be a miracle worker. Just allow the obVious to happen. Since most people are in an hyp­ notic trance, if you can just see 10% of the obVious you are a miracle worker. If you can see 25%. you are a God. People will always associate whatever precedes an event as the cause of the event. As such, always let your presence precede a happy occurrence and always let someone else precede a painful one. 19 Tlle TOxiCk Magician is well aware of the constant hill lie between aspects of the same force: the desire 11I1 ('omplete control and the desire for the unpre­ dldable which brings about the necessary destabi­ IIY,a! Ion of the entire human stIucture. As the desire for predictability (control) increases, n:d ural consequences are automatically set in lIultion which lead to destabilization or Chaos. This process happens both cosmically and micro­ I~('opically. This theory doesn't assume a simple lin­ mlr process within this gigantic struggle, but instead assumes muWple processes (which, from time to I fme, might include a simple linear process). In other words. the mathematical functions are multiple, and are sometimes interactive and complex. This leads to inconsistent error when certain phe­ nomena are scrutinized, since stabilization and destabilization are forever interacting, and something may be on the verge of complete destruction (meta­ morphosis) while appearing completely stable at the moment of observation. Humans are control freaks. The Manipulator knows that, even stronger than the reaLity of sex and food, is the desire to control sex and food. Once something comes under apparent control, the organism seeks to control other events to the ex­ tent that it invents games and devices which prOVide the opportunity to play the control game. The Practitioner spends a good deal of time ana­ 1yzing the peculiar way{s) in which people play their control game{s). 85 84"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"Pandemonium The desire to control is so powerful that SUII'ld, and mass madness are sometimes the only thlil/', which will satisfY this desire.

Control is what they desire, even if they have lo force someone else to take up the cause for them. The Toxick Magician 1s an expert in helping people stabilize and de-stabilize. He knows just when to introject the necessary force to accomplish his end which is, of course, control. He helps people seek destruction and death to escape the tension of living. For most people, time is tension and the clock, with its tight spring \"forever unwinding,\" is an ideal model. The tension unwinds until the clock stops. The Manipulator knows how to hold out hope. Hope allows the food on the chain the illusion that time has not run out. However, hope can't be used continuously. Reality is just too much. Aging, death, pain, loss and fear are just too real and, sooner or later, the spring doesn't wish to be wound up again. But, in spite of this wish, the Toxick Magician may give it a \\vind or two anyway. Hope springs eternal and, just as the hope is coming to fruition, it is swallowed up by the monster of time. The Practitioner doesn't believe in the progress of human nature, nor does he believe in the progress of 86 The Psychopath's Bible 11111111111 hehavior.

Help people realize how easy it is to lose the things they have or want. The trick in all of this is not to become identified as the bearer of bad tid­ ings-unless you are looking for people with a strong stomach.

This can also be done even more indirectly by telling the story to someone when the victim is nut even present if you know that the person to whom you tell the story will spread the story in the direction you want it to go. Learn to spread rumors in ways which will create concern, suspicion or trust. Create fires and then put them out. ThiS technique is essential in building trust and confidence in people you want to use later. Learn to confuse people and then help them out of their confusion.

After much self-training, the Practitioner always asks himself questions about the environment and the humans operating in it. He is always aware of the limitations of a situation. He is constantly examining the important social reinforcers within any given context. He determines the pecking order and notices which people are most easily influenced by approval or disapproval. He is especially alert to anyone in authority with excellent social skills as he knows that such a person could also be a Toxick Magician. He knows that a good Practitioner avoids direct confrontation and frequently speaks obliquely in order not to offend people or make them feel small.

One of the main themes of childhood is the gain­ ing of information. This is called \"learning\" and adults do a fine job of making children stupid by their methods of indoctrination. Compared to adults, children have minimal infor­ mation. On the other hand, children have less per­ ceptual and cognitive bias than adults, For both the adult and the child; information is constantly being redefined, not only in content, but also in terms of how real information is defined. Put simply, real information consists of learning how to ignore and select data. For example, forty years ago few children had much information about sex. Today, sex is so com­ mon that it is not really information at all. Once everything becomes available to everyone, it becomes nothing for everyone, People appear more sophisticated today but, as the gross level of sophistication rises, the real infor­ mation becomes more hidden and valuable. When you hear an advertisement \"disclose\"; \"Be the first to know what the markets are doing,\" remember that it is being heard by millions of people at once. Where is the real information? It's mostly in the fact that millions of people each think they are I 'I hearing the real information first. 92 The Psychopath's Bible '1'1l1~ l~ the illusion that TV prOVides; that you and Ill[Hj(' aruund you-alone-are being entertained.

II n'nl information could be had by everyone, it would IIIIJlIt:diately become worthless. Information, by its wry definition, implies ignorance and exclusivity. We II'quire ignorance in order to be informed. What most people carl information is nothing Illore than another level of noise. Some optimists who are aware of the problem simply state that the Information is available but the use of the informa­ tion is still dependent on the intelligence of the popu­ lution. Mass intelligence is nothing more than mass lnformation. Zero is still zero. What is fascinating about this entire process is that everyone thinks they know more but, in fact, they know less. Moreover, what they do know is next to useless and is often mis-information. Thus, each new level of information is nothing more than a higher level of non-sense. What we generally call information is nothing more than a higher level of incompetence. People forget that, like indiViduals, each civiliza­ tion rises to its highest level of incompetence. The Toxick Magician knows that if you help someone or something long enough, it will finally wish to be left alone. At that point help it a bit more and then drop it. At that point it will become like England: a land of non-entities with expenSive titles. ThiS is the meaning of what we call information. The more teachers, the dumber the students.

Thes(' issues are important considerations for the Master. His goal is to help information become marc worthless while creating the illusion that it has more value. He does this by helping people ask more questions in very well-controlled and well-defined situations. He also promotes the collapse by helping crimi­ nalize behavior which interferes with the information highway. He knows that the criminahzation of human behavior serves one primary purpose: the destruction of the system which defines crime. The more crimi­ nals, the more resources necessary to control crime and criminals. The more resources reqUired, the more economic disruption and thus the more crimi­ nals reqUired to fill the gaps in the system. 1ill: I 1: '11 94 22 I\\U mega-systems become top-heavy awl ('bllPI k, 1'1 lis is much like a family With more children Ill: til JIIllds available to feed them.

As long as there are doors, there will be prisons. The key is to get the prisoner to pay you for ser­ vices that he could provide better for himself. Thus. 1 he first task is to teach him that he can't care for himself and reqUires assistance. Once he accepts his dependency on metaphysical grounds and submits, his ownership is guaranteed. Slavery as we knew it before, for example, the Civil War in the U.S .• was a bad thing. It made us aware of something best forgotten-universal, hierar­ chical slavery. When overt slavery ended, we lost our example of what slavery was really all about. Slavery slipped back into our unconscious. All good Practitioners know how to manipulate the common man's desire to be a slave while main­ taining the illusion of being a free person. It is better for the common man to think that he is free as he is held in the anTIs of his caretaker. Democracy is the best political system of slavery ever invented. In a democracy, the slaves believe that they are \"free\" and have a \"voice\" in their affairs. Thus, they are waring slaves and, as such. the possi­ bility of a revolt is much less than in an overt system of slavery. 95"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"Pandemonium This simple fact is supported by the numlJ('1 ill books which have been written about self-esl(;I'111 The desired results are impossible to obtain Sin(T Ii slave can only have false self-esteem.

If they feel any pain at all, it is minimal. The fact of the matter is simple: people are so Llllliliar with abuse and misuse that they are un­ \"ware of it. This is worth repeating, Most people are ~H) used to being abused that for all intents and pur­ poses they are unaware that they are being abused :lnd, in most cases, expect it. More interesting is the fact that, when they do feel abused, they get upset by events and actions which make them unaware of their real condition and the chronic abuse which they \"suffer.\" Moreover, they take the events of life, both good and bad, very personally. This fact alone contributes to their overall sense of malaise and stupidity, They are hard-wired to suffer and, in most cases, to suffer without much awareness. A deadened suffering is the norm and is expected. Understanding the origin of human behavior is like looking for a place to land a plane when the earth below is covered by a huge, thick cloud. Human behavior makes no sense from a hedoniC point of view, nor does it make sense from any alter­ native idea. The human being is an unfinished entity, bur­ dened by a strange mix of cortical and sub-cortical processes and a body which requires immense arti­ fices to protect and assure it of its immortality. 97"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"'I 24 One thing we know-very well-is that 11101,1 humans have been hired on as extras.

Most people are extras who somehow have b(' come deluded into thinking they are stars-albej t burnt-out ones. A few people are not extras on the stage but are stunt men, hired to play dangerous roles for the real star. But even stunt men are rare. It's funny to walk into a bank or a grocery store and watch the tellers and clerks. A good Toxick Magician knows how to watch them and manipulate them. He knows that they feel that they have a little power-and they do-but they are taught not to abuse it, because it is a sign of bad taste. Just watch them drool as they count out the money or say \"no\" to someone. Then watch them hang their little heads as they gaze blankly at their paychecks. Nonetheless. each is a star, each has a room somewhere where he is king. Somewhere people rec­ ognize them as they perform their daily chores. Watch the smile on their faces when you recognize them. Watch how some try to hold back their enthu­ siasm-like a dead puppy dog. Others flaunt their authority like a bit player who has 30 seconds on second camera.

Many of the extras will have gone, some of the audi­ ence will have moved on, and the star-well. who can tell? Is her new billing for real, or is it just another temp job, waiting until someone better comes along?

In this way, common man has the potential to act as if he was a sower of discord and disobedience. but this remains well under control-except dUring certain times of the year and in certain places. Other than pathological individuals (which in­ clude Toxick Magicians who have lost control), com­ mon man is nicely controlled by bouts of depression, temper tantrums, guilt. sorrow, terror and fear. The result of all of these emotions is that common man is nullified. which allows for his ability to perform the rather pathetic and puny tasks to which he and others have given significance. 102 103"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"Append'ix A Few Useful Teaching Tools The following is a short, semi-random list 01 books, movies and events which we like for variOII(1 reasons and which the aspiring or practicing Toxldl Magician might find useful to study.

Only in a few cases, however, do we recommend the work unreservedly: often the amount of useful information varies tremendously. Some (like The Thomas Crown Affair and Point Break) are excellent portrayals of the psychopath from beginning to end. Others (like Thelma and Louise are more limited-in our view it was rather so-so until the end), In some the psychopath-protagonists are highly limited by the circumstances of their social environment (e.g., in GoodjeUas the full expression of psychopathy was limited-not because of the wider external society, but because of the more limited society of a gang with its own rules.)

It damn well better be!)\" On Drums is Father Daniel Suders whose Fourteen Steps was first pub- lished in Rebels & Devils: The Psychology of Liberation (edited by Christopher S. Hyatt, Ph.D., New Falcon Publications, 2001). Suders was an ordained clergyman active in the Episcopal church (really!) and a bartender. For more than ten years he worked in some of ,the sleaziest bars in Hollywood. (This included the Spotlite-which was also the name of a Nazi rag during Hitler's regime. A coincidence-or something more insidious?) His customers ranged from bikers who write poetry, to hookers and boy hustlers, and to any number of sociopaths, most of whom have done time. He was also a writer and enjoyed debunking popular, pre-packaged, freeze-dried ideology. Before his death, he completed Volume I11 of The Longest and Worst Poem in the English Language.

Once the pattern has been established, it is used as a framework for interpreting new facts which arise within the situation. To demonstrate the documentary method in action, Garfinkel set up an experiment in the Psychiatry department of a university. He asked a number of students to take part in the experiment, telling them that it involved a new form of Psychotherapy. The students were invited to talk about their personal problems with an 'advisor' who was separated from them by a screen. They could not see the advisor and could only communicate with him via an intercom. They were to ask him a series of questions about their problems to which he would respond by answering either 'yes' or 'no'. What the students didn't know was that these responses were not authentic answers to the questions posed but a predetermined sequence of yes and no answers drawn from a table of random numbers. Garfinkel found that, although there was no real consistency in the answers given to the questions asked, the students nevertheless managed to make sense of them, discerning some underlying pattern in the advice they were being given. Most found the advice reasonable and helpful. This was so even when, as must inevitably happen when answers are Harold Garfinkle's Studies in Ethnomethodology Prentice Hall 1966 19"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"given randomly, some of the advice was contradictory. Thus, in one case, a student asked: \"So you think I should drop out of school then?\" and received a 'yes' response. Surprised by this he asked, \"You really think I should drop out of school?\" only to be given a 'no' answer. Rather than dismissing the advice as nonsense, the student struggled to find its meaning, looking back for a pattern in the advisors' responses, referring back to previous answers, trying to make sense of the contradiction in terms of the advisors' knowledge of this problem. Never did it occur to the student to doubt the sincerity of the advisor. What the students were doing throughout these counselling sessions, Garfinkel argues, was constructing a social reality to make sense of an often-senseless interaction. By using the documentary method, they were able to bring order to what was in fact a chaotic situation.

Being considered by Utne is tantamount"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"to the big time in my world. You see, I don't do it for the money. At least, I didn't back then. Things have changed since then, but I am getting ahead of myself. Standing in the rain, watching the pretty little earth-muffins overturning cars and breahng windows, I suddenly had a thought. I cannot say where it came from. It seemed to have come out of thin air as thoughts sometimes do, without a logic sequence of thinking or events leading up to it. Why not seek out and interview the leader of the first recorded organized labor movement? None other than Lucifer himself, the fallen one. But how? After the rally, I went back to the train station, retrieved my backpack from the day locker, boarded my southbound train and made a written to- do list of things I would need to research and retrieve. After I arrived home, I quickly logged my laptop into my wireless DSL connection, looked up some books and then ordered them overnight on amazon.com. Two days later I had found what I needed. On pages 244 through 248 of The Book of Black Magic and Pacts by Arthur Edward Waite are detailed instructions for conjuring \"Emperor Lucifer, conjuring Lucifer, Master and Prince of Rebellious Spirits.\" For obvious reasons it will not be quoted here. I acquired the needed materials and spent two days preparing the space and myself for the deed at hand. Just as I was weighing the silver ingot, having everything else at the ready, I heard a knock at my door. I impatiently strode to the door, irritated by the interruption of my painstaking preparations. I flung the door open, wafting a plume of incense smoke in the process. When the smoke cleared I found a dapper gentleman, tastefully dressed, fit and tan, standing at the door. He held a cane in the crook of his elbow that had a silver star atop the handle. \"Can I help you?\" I said exasperated. \"You requested an interview with me?\" said the man in a pleasant voice. \"Excuse me?\" I said, not catching on right away. \"No, excuse me for not introducing myself, I am Lucifer,\" he said, producing a simple black text on white background business card that read: LUCIFER - NOT SATAN lucifer @ ange1oflight.com"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"\"Uh. Oh. Um.. .\" I was flustered. \"Aren't you going to ask me in?\" he asked. \"Um, certainly, yes.\" I stammered. \"Thank you,\" he said, moving into my apartment smoothly. He removed his fedora and gave my ritual accoutrements a cursory glance. \"A bit outdated,\" he said. \"One need only send me an email these days. I rarely get asked for an interview anymote, so my schedule is usually clear.\" By now I had begun to regain my composure so I set my mind to the task of controlling this interview. This was it, my big break, and I could not blow this. \"So, no one conjures you the old fashioned way anymore?\" I asked."},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"\"Oh sure they do,\" he said, seating himself at my dining room table. I was kicking myself for missing the opportunity to offer him the seat, therefore asserting my control of the situation. I had to grab the reins here ! 'Want a drink?\" I asked, moving towards my makeshift bar. \"No, thank you,\" he said. \"What kind of people generally try to conjure you up the old fashioned I way?' I asked, continuing the previous thought-thread. \"Did you ever see the movie Spawn?\" he asked. \"There's this scene where Clowny, a demonic played by John Leguizamo, takes Spawn to a cemetery to dig up his own body, to prove to him that he's really dead. In the background, some heavy metal types are trying to summon me, using some butchered hokum, probably from that carny LeVay's books. Don't get me wrong. I love Anton's schtick, but not for the reasons that you might imagine that I would.\" He paused for a moment and then continued, \"Anyway, back to the Clowny story: When the Metal Heads see Clowny and Spawn creating some otherworldly pyrotechnics, they rush over and ask, 'Did the great Dark Lord send you?' and Clowny looks over his shoulder and then asks no one in particular, 'Why does God get all the smart ones and we get all the retards?\"' he then fell silent, grinning. \"I don't understand.\" I replied. He gave my occult clutter another visual sweep and then replied, \"No, I don't suppose you do.\" Damn, I didn't see that one coming. I needed to get on top of this interview. \"Ok, tell me about the fall.\" I asked. \"You were banished. Right?\" \"Sure, we were banished.

You are an inmate. You built the prison. Yahweh was the original judge, jury and executioner. I am merely the warden. My job is to rehabilitate you. My secret wish is to see you tunnel out with a spoon, but in the meantime I do my -job. Sort of. It's hard to explain. The so-called demons are merely the guards, the screws.

The Angels who still work for the 'mad one7 are the cops outside the walls. You get past us, you still have to contend with them. I, however, am secretly rooting for you. There are some kernels of truth spread around.. . ' ' \"Like the Pseudopigraphia?'I asked. \"Yes, like that, but no one reads that crusty old text anymore. In order for a story to come through with all of it's potential mythic resonance, it must be couched in the language and symbols of its time.

As I was saying, John De Vito did a nice rendition with The Devil's Apocrypha. There's been others, but you can start there.\" \"So what is this so called true story?\" I asked, trying to muster my self- confidence back into the fore. \"The job of a writer is not to say something new. It is rather, to decrypt that which has already been said plainly but then encrypted, so that it may be received and decoded properly in it's time.\" he said flatly. \"What is that supposed to mean?\" I asked. \"Isn't that a redundant question, considering what I just said?\" he replied. \"This is bullshit! You talk in circles. I think you should go now.\" I said, testily. \"Have it your way. You were the one that wanted to interview me. Circles is what is.\" He said, half smiling \"I'm not feeling prepared for this, you came unannounced.. .\" I quavered. \"No, I came because I was invited.\" He said firmly."},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"\"Get out!\" I shouted, angry for some unexplained reason. \"I am being rebuked!

The question is; Food for what or whom?\" Now, just for you junior!\" he smiled and then vanished in a puff of sulfuric smoke. The interview was a disaster. I had asked none of the questions that I had prepared. In a fit of rage I kicked the leg of my home entertainment center and it collapsed, trashing my 30\" color TV, DVDNCR combo and digital cable box.

You see that we have learned from many years of experience that we imprint who we are on everybody we encounter. So it is best to be \"up front\" about what we do.

Dr. Hyatt: A conspiracy is usually defined as an agreement (often secret) to perform an illegal, wrongful, or subversive act-rarely defined as performing a legal, helpful, happy act. --Hee Haw! This is one of the best conspiracies of them all-a conspiracy of benevo- lence. Not only is it fun, but it will rarely be believed-and it is often the most dangerous to the people involved. Everyone likes evil better. First and foremost you need at least one human brain. Even alone, a per- son could become suspicious of himself-as in conspiring against one- self. A brain alone can also assume that there are other brains out there some- where and begin to speculate on what they might be up to. Next, is the belief in a hierarchy of causal-meaning agents-a grand theory of how the world really operates. This simply means that all things have a conscious intention behind them. Often there is a refusal to accept randomness, hapenstance and stupidity as the primary forces. Most conspiracies are built on the model of god in his heaven controlling the world. Consider these seven religious principles: A. All is ordained by heaven B. All is concealed behind the obvious. C. The truth is always trying to reveal itself to those that believe. D. Avoid revealing how you really feel-keep your deeper feelings, particularly negative ones, secret. E. Every act you intend to do must have the help of the Higher Power. F. We have free will to operate within the Higher plan. G. Know and attach yourself to those people who have greater knowledge of the great plan. Does any of this sound familar? hehehehehe"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"~t's all about the ability to be anxious, nervous, frightened. Rarely do we hear of \"good conspiracies\" or if we do, we are not that interested in them. Humans like \"evil\" conspiracies better. In fact, humans love searching and finding dark-evil motives. The inability to live in cognitive dissonance. Any explanation is better than no explanation at all. The ability to confuse metaphor with fact and to mix them up in the same sentence. The ability to change the word possible into probable and then, finally, it must be. Holding to half truths.. . Misapplication of assumptions and models from one area to another. The belief that there are Higher Powers-that there are those who have plans and knowledge that the average person is unaware of. The human brain likes to connect dots, and once it makes a picture-any picture-it believes it to be the Truth. A fundamental dislike of authority and the belief that they are intention- ally up to no good. The opposite may also operate-the worship of authority and the belief that evil is trying to destroy them. For some people, the belief that their personal failures are due to evil forces operating to control them and the world at large. The belief that people are able to keep massive amounts of secrets, when, in fact, most people love to share secrets.. .and then create alliances and create more secrets. People love to play detective and prefer just about any explanation, par- ticularly if it gives them meaning and upholds their beliefs. My position is rather simple-something similar to Indra's net: most of what we call conspiracy is the result of a rather large correlation matrix interacting and presenting dots which we then connect and from which we make interesting pictures. Of course, there are real conspiracies-that is intentional ones-but most of them are tacit, simply based on the structure of the human brain. The most powerful conspiracies are those we can't and don't know about, until we stare into the mirror and find ourselves staring back. -Later, friend."},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"Copyright O 2004 CE by Christopher S.

This means a world without otherworldly purpose, order, meaning, or value. a an is a cognitive creature (not necessarily rational) whose brain both amplifies and ameliorates his fears. The amplification is both a curse-as seen in his religions and beliefs-and a blessing-as seen in his science \\ and self-discipline. Life is indifferent to man-sometimes dangerous, sometimes helpful- but this is not something nature intends as nature intends nothing. The helpfulness or hostility of life is simply an interpretation from man's point of view, a result of his unique cognitive ability. Man inherently, automatically, involuntarily and continually creates meaning-he is genetically programmed to do so. But man also has the capacity to recognize that such meaning IS his own invention and not reality. Unfortunately, most men can not and will not reconstruct their primal constructions. This indifferent universe gives man ultimate freedom within the limita- tion of his own biologic nature. With this freedom comes anxiety and there is no one, or no thing, to live life for him in his place. Man can be his own salvation-not his labels, mother, father, god, presi- dent, doctor, etc. Man's uncanny and successful ability to create other- worldly powers and then forget he has created them has saved him from extinction-as well imprisoning him in a self-created penitentiary. To cope with his condition, man invents an otherworldly purpose (ideal categories) or, in rare cases, he can stand naked and face the chances and accidents of life using his own nature as his primary tool. He can choose to set aside the \"meaning\" he has created, and act based on pure (direct),"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"uilinterpreted reality (that is, respond by bypassing his categories); yet, whatever reality he responds to, it is a function of the structure of his brain, nothing more nothing less. He can develop himself into a piece of art-a standard for himself which he can admire+r he can remain an advanced \"ape.\" Most men are noth- ing more than an advanced, talking ape. A universe without a moral teleology has no purpose or order and has no moral values that man can use to interpret and order his life. I All religious, and most philosophical, interpretations of the universe and choice mechanisms are based on these constructions and are nothing but survival devices invented and policed by men and their social institutions to satisfy man's questioning brain. Hence the brain amplifies the primal issues of survival providing both an exaggerated and a calming effect. The potentially free man must reject as pollution all sanctioned explana- tions of life and the moral systems based upon them. He may use them as a device when necessary but, in essence, he has trashed them. I He must accept the realities of nothing, of chance, accident, death, decay, disease and dementia and, having accomplished this through his own efforts, he has the option to attempt to discover through trial and error and by critical and often painful evaluation of his knowledge, what is valuable and useful to him. Most men find the effort to do ,this too painful, too frightening, too much work, etc.-and, because they never attempt the process, they never discover the freedom it can bring, the exhilaration, the joy, the freedom afforded by knowing oneself. Those that do the necessary work of self- discovery live on a different level and speak a different language; they are often rejected by society and stand alone. What is of value for man is what makes him happy-from eating, to sex, i to adventure, to inventing, to making himself into a piece of art--and this I i includes discipline-for ddiscipljne gives man a greater happiness-he can be in control of himself-he is not the simple victim of chance and circumstances or sanctioned metaphysics. Feeling in control of himself through discipline and scientific discovery replaces and dissolves man's need for his preceding creations: metaphysics and re1,igion. It requires that he continually THINK and QUESTION, and simply live with the fear generated by the realization that answers may or may not come.. .

This is what 1 brings one the exhilarating freedom and joy possible in life. r: b / Man in the world can develop a way of life that conforms to his desire to control his life. This method involves discipline, analytic thought, intuition and pleasure and is best summed up as the \"risking to be man.\" In this way, man no longer feels a victim and, even if he is destroyed, his life is not defeated. The rare individual who has recognized the reality of \"nothing\" and who, depending on the stage of their ability and powers, are either struggling with the fear, anxiety, and loss of control which the recognition of \"nothing\" brings; or who are in the process of learning the nature of dignity and integrity which are the result of discipline, using the brain, joy in living and discovery.

It has been known for more than a century that the lower the intelligence of a subject, the more difficult it is to hypnotize them. Something similar may apply to magic. If no one is there, there is no target for the curse, so it goes elsewhere; in this case, my mother's relatives. Do I have your attention? Good.

I adjusted it too far the other way. - - My other cousin, the oldest daughter of my mother's other brother, was !I abducted, raped and murdered within an hour of the conclusion of my fi second ceremony.

In the words of the late Bull- winkle Moose, \"This time for sure!\" I I waited until the next propitious day, which if memory serves, was Walpurgis night, I performed the ceremony again. This time, I don't know what the hell scent it was following, although there is an interest- / ing possibility that I will pursue later. She didn't die that time either, although I thought she had once while asleep on the couch. Breathing, I apparently, is unnecessary at that age. In a deep depression, I avoided answering many phone messages for about ten days, though I did write them down. Finally, I picked up the 'phone on a friend in California (I was in Missouri) and he told me he had been trying to get hold of me for ten days. He told me his ex-lover had committed suicide with some kind of downer. It happened the day following my ritual. The interesting thing about this was that this young man had always claimed he had been psychic. A claim I never paid much attention to as he had an I.Q. approximately that of a sponge.

It was my friend. He sounded rather panicked and said there was something in the apartment. He described seeing a figure, like a free-standing, three-dimensional fig- ure of a man, made from hazy black smoke. I had seen something like this myself years before during an experiment in Santeria (described in Urban Voodoo) and had known other people over the years, some with no involvement in the esoteric or occult whatsoever, describe similar things. More recently, Sex and Rockets, the biography of Jack Parsons, told of a similar apparition conjured up by him and a group of fellow- travelers (including L. Ron Hubbard) in his Crowleyan magic group in California in the 1940's. So, feeling rather creepy at this point, I asked him if he had any garlic (well, what was I supposed to do?) and when the answer was no, I told him to pray, or something, and not to call again unless the furniture was flying across the room. Sometime after midnight, the 'phone rang. While the sofas weren't fly- ing, it was obvious from his near hysteria that something had happened. He said that he had been in bed, in the dark, when he felt the pressure of a body against his from behind, and assumed it was his boyfriend. Suddenly, without any preliminaries or lubrication of any kind (rude, at the very least) he was penetrated by a very large male member, moving very fast. He cried out in pain, and flailed on the bed. In doing so, he touched his boyfriend who was on the other side of the bed. He froze in terror, and the \"man\" disappeared. Other friends called me out of the blue during those eight months with other uncanny stories, most having no interest in such things themselves, but giving me a call because I did. I slowly came to the eerie conclusion that whether the \"spirit\" could read my mind or not, it was somehow capable of tracking my associations. It was Dr. Hyatt who first inclined me to this idea, as something unpleasant happened to him as well (no, no astral buttfucking) which he attributed to my \"successful\" working. Since that time I have read some of the older books on involvement with non-human intelligences, from Dion Fortune (the only \"magician\" who has much straightforward and intelligent to say on the matter, perhaps because she wasaa psychologist) to psychical researchers from the nineteenth century onward who examined people who made such claims of contact. The mass of modern commentary on such things from \"magicians\" is a melange of inept Crowleyan references to the unconscious (in spite of his claims, he knew nothing about psychology except that of manipulation, which he probably learned from"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"his preacher father) and Jungian nonsense used to explain why your imaginary friend can't do anything for you in the real world.) ) CIJ Culture Many of the things that kill us unnecessarily are unquestioned cultural norms and superstitions that are accepted as reality even though many of them can be easily checked. A-mong the former-and most frequently deadly-are the supposed value of family relationships; prime among the latter are Christian-Islamic-Judaic religious values, hereafter referred to as CIJ (pronounced \"keege\") for short. Other things have a supernatural smell to them. These are the things Western culture doesn't want you to believe in, yet are real, and real enough to kill. I refer you to the bizarre stories at the beginning of this essay. One of the great myths of European society, and its retarded stepchild, America, is that curses (or good luck spells) only work if the person they are directed at believes in them. There is a psychological phenomena-formulated circa the 1940's- 60's-called \"Voodoo death,\" which involves the death of a person who has been informed of being the subject of a death curse. They are in- formed, one way or another, and the autonomic nervous system overre- acts to such a degree that it kills them. Unfortunately, as has been pointed out many times, in a society that believes in magic, anyone who finds out they are cursed would immedi- ately go to another magician to have ,the spell counteracted. It would, therefore, behoove the sorcerer to keep his work a secret. There is also an old saying in the Caribbean islands that there is no easier target for a spell than a white man who doesn't believe in magic. It must be said, however, that in places like Haiti, or in communities where Santeria or Macumba are practiced, both methods are sometimes used. Among the tiny minority of \"wiccans\" or \"Crowlyites\" that I have met who genuinely practiced magic to influence real-time events, the ones who have talked openly about their experiments have confirmed that the basic rules of witchcraft, which are identical throughout the world, seem to hold true. Informing your target of the spell, is not one of them. The lover Who Wouldn't Go Away I once had a friend who had an unrequited love for some young woman.

He was to place this somewhere I where she would pass over it or be very near it daily. That was the last that I saw of him for nearly six months. When I saw him again, he looked a little too eager to see me. He told me that he had planted the talisman between her mattress and box springs after following my instructions, and waited for results. (She was living with him when I gave him the talisman, but she didn't \"love\" him, had her own room, and was about to leave.) At first, he said, her feelings not only revived, but she said she was head-over-heels in love with him. Things went great for three months or so and then turned strange. She became less and less interested in sex but still maintained her intense love for him. Finally she said she didn't want to have sex any more but loved him and wanted to stay with him. He was sure she wasn't seeing anyone else. She had no intention of leaving or of willingly let him see anyone else. What should he do? Retrieve the talisman and destroy it, I replied. He couldn't. Her bedroom had it's own lock, and since he planted it, he hadn't had a single chance to get the damn thing. And that's the last that I ever heard of it.

The proportion of rubbish to fact, I eventually came to find, was so great that one knowledgeable critic declared it a novel. But back to the real Nazis. In one of the most famous stories told about Hitler he is quoted as saying, \"The superman already exists.

Now, as far as I know, this is entirely verboten. In any case, he was in a hotel room one evening, and prepared to inject himself with whatever drug it was whose effects he was trying to codify. Just what that was isn't im- portant as he either picked up the wrong syringe or had forgotten to pre- pare it. He injected himself with what he described as \"detergent foam.\" If this is literally what it was, he was lucky he didn't have an embolism! It sent him into a very bad place, possibly near death. But right at the height (or nadir) of the experience, he entered a state of calm-the room disappeared around him, and he found himself in a chamber, or space, where two beings stood in front of him and identified themselves as aliens. After a conversation with them (which you may read for yourself in The Center of the Cyclone) he awoke, in some physical distress, but otherwise fine. It could be dismissed easily as a chemically induced hallucination but Lilly, a trained observer, admitted in his book that he was unsure. After consideration (and it was some time between the experiments and the writing of the book), he said it had unique qualities he had not experienced on LSD or other chemicals, and so, considered the possibility that somehow, for some reason, it was real.

In addition, there is Terrence McKenna, a man considered an expert on psychedelic mushrooms, who also claims to have talked to aliens (or something) while under the influence. In addition, he suggests that psychedelic plants may have given a boost to early man's brain development. They are still used sacramentally in many religions. He also points out that animals (e.g., horses), are known to deliberately seek out plants like datura. McKenna also asserts that psychedelic experience were far more important in the development ofhuman history than has generally been realized.

I am not talking about rioting in the streets, although that may come, too.

I am refemng primarily here to religionists, but it applies even to the totally irreligious whose view of things is locked into a time already past. This is exemplified by that triad of stupidity, CIJ. Those who wish to survive, much less thrive, in this environment must proactively embrace attitudes and technologies for living they might not want known to their friends, family and neighbors. Among these are \"alternative\" (which often means \"foreign\") medicines and methods of bodily maintenance which the general-practice M.D. might frown upon (I have never personally met a family-practice doctor who knew about anything but B-12, but I know they are out there). Yoga and self-hypnosis (the existence of the latter is still denied in a dis- tinctly paranoid way by some doctors) both have extensive backgrounds of Western research, that of hypnosis going back to the late eighteenth I century. Having practiced both of these for going on twenty years, I can I attest to the fact that the saying is easier than the doing, and there are few activities that will demonstrate just how thoroughly you already are hyp- notized than beginning these techniques. An excellent overall history of hypnosis can be found in Trance by Brian Ingliss (Paladin, 1990). Sex, Sperm B Blood The disciplining, NOT repression, of sex is something which even people whom I have met that are more sexually enthusiastic than normal find almost impossible to do.

I have had-and known others who have had-experiences that could only be described as paranormal in conjunction with the sexual addition to ritual.

There are, of course, methods of homosexual sex I magic. The basic technique described above can be adapted with some 1: 5 flourishes. Ignoring the nonsense of consuming your own spem, the k primary use of sexual fluids and, indeed, blood in magic is the consecra- j tion of talismans.

In this practice, the person performing the oral activity refrains from orgasm and concentrates on the lifeforce entering hislher system and remaining there. While vampirism is disappointingly more difficult in reality than in the movies, some distinctly weird phenomena seem connected to it. The few people I have known who have tried this (those, that is, whose stories I trust), have described uncomfortable I physical and psychic states, and sometimes odd reactions in their sex i , partners, apparently including unwanted telepathic contact.

Upon closing the door behind his departing friend, he heard a thud in the hall outside. He opened the door to check, and discovered his young man flat on the floor. When asked if he was all right, the yourig man said, \"I don't know what happened. Suddenly I got dizzy and fell.\" He assumed the experiment worked, and so do I.

He went into spontaneous trance-states that he described as, not hypnotic, but almost psychedelic. He also developed a constant and totally useless precognitive faculty.

A fender-bender in the street, or a skunk rounding a comer (skunks are endemic in that part of Hollywood)-that kind of thing. When the activity stopped, the phe- nomena stopped.

If the rules are followed, the accompanying phenomena (if they occur) will rarely have a negative backlash. It should be repeated, however, and for any serious goal; about a month should be allowed for, the ritual being performed at least twice a week. One drawback: your talisman may become a little crusty. The considered and focused use of fantasies to free yourself from envi- ronmental norms. computer material, pornography, odd old movies, can be used in conjunction with Tantrik techniques and self-hypnosis to great effect.

INSTITUTE FOR THE (XPERIMENTAL INV6STIGATION Of THE ORIGIN OF LIFE (IEIOL) This work advocates that life may have originated on earth through the influence of electromagnetic forces produced by lightning discharges in a primordial reducing atmosphere. Early research [l] concentrated upon the electric component of the discharge and yielded the basic building blocks of matter: amino acids. This presentation focuses upon lightning- generated electromagnetic fields as the causal agent of higher-ordered organic synthesis. It postulates that certain electromagnetic frequencies naturally favour biological synthesis. To test this idea, magnetic and radio frequency fields were applied to such-atm~spheres resulting in the synthesis of not only amino acids, but also peptides and polypeptides, complex compounds produced only by living matter.

The spark discharge across the gap simulated the light- ning discharges that were believed to have raked the primordial atmo- sphere for tens of millions of years, giving rise to organic compounds that \"somehow\" organizes thcmselves into living matter. The water component of the reaction condensed back into a liquid after passing through a watercooled condenser. From there it moved through the U-tube pictured, and flowed back into the boiling flask. This gaseous- water vapor mix was recirculated nonstop for seven days. What Miller produced in this experiment stunned the scientific world: amino acids, the basic building blocks of all life on earth. Figure 1.

Apart from some interesting results that mimicked larger organic compounds, no substantial progress was made, however, towards answering the fundamental question of how life arose on earth. By the early 1980's, work on the electric (lightning-simulated) discharge and its associated phenomena was abandoned, and emphasis shifted away from this fundamental question. Instead, the scientific societies' involved became interested in such related activities as DNA-RNA arti- ficial synthesis. From the 1990's to the present, their focus shifted again; this time, to the speculation of how life may have been transported to earth by meteoric and cometary bombardment. For all practical purposes then, the attack on the fundamental problem has been abandoned by the scientific community at large and remains as such today. fin Impetus to experiment For the past thirty-four years the author has been engaged in this field of scientific exploration. He has proposed a new theoretical model that attempts to further an answer to the fundamental question, and has tested it in the laboratory. This new model arose from several factors, including an analysis of Miller's original paper [I]. This study indicated that, of the numerous variables tested in his experiments, the most important were the means by which lightning phenomena was simulated. Principally, as mentioned previously, Miller used a continuous radio fre- quency (RF) discharge. In addition, however, a pulsed direct current source was also used to simulate electrostatic charge buildup between adjacent clouds, or between cloud and ground. Lastly, a continuous AC electric discharge of 15,000 volts, provided by a transformer, was also employed. The RF discharge produced the most fruitful results: about 1 gram of organic compounds after a week's continuous sparking. Among the important amino acids produced were glycine, d,l-alanine, a-alanine, d,l-a-aminen-butyric acid, sarcosine, and a-arqjnoisobutyric acid. The AC discharge produced about one-third this quantity, while the pu,lsed DC discharge yielded a smaller production of glycine only. The internal pressure of the apparatus was maintained at < 1.5 atmo- spheres and Miller speculated that higher pressures might decrease the time required for organic compound production. Due to these and other chemical factors presented in his paper, Miller concluded that amino acids and the more important compounds of living systems would be"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"formed in the solution phase as opposed to the gas phase (and discharge site) of the system. This latter and crucial view was supported by the lack of urea in the experimental results he obtained. R New Theoretical Model A new model that attempts to explain the mechanism of complex mole- cule formation is presented in [TJ but is too extensive for inclusion here. The essential feature of the model is that the frequency of the discharge energy input is a critical component of synthesis: not just the magnitude of the energy itself. Electrically charged byproducts of the discharge, in particular protons, will have a magnetic dipole moment associated with them due to their in- trinsic spin. In the presence of a magnetic field these dipoles will precess at the Larmor frequency and superposition of an RF electromagnetic field can induce resonance effects that aid alignment of the bonds be- tween the discharge products. This increases the probability of the for- mation of long-chain molecules. The lightning discharge is harmonically rich and, in addition to low fre- quency magnetic fields associated with bulk current flow, radio fre- quency fields will also be present. This gives rise to the possibility that the resonance conditions outlined above could have arisen naturally in the lightning discharge process, and could be the actual mechanism by which higher ordered organic synthesis occurred on primordial earth. The apparatus used by the author (Figure 2) attempts to simulate the conditions under which such synthesis may occur. The pressure in Miller's apparatus was of order 1.5 atmospheres. Differ- ing cosmological views suggests that the pressure on prebiotic earth was higher than this and may have played a role in organic synthesis. The author believes this was indeed the case and his apparatus operated at 2.0 atmospheres. In addition the apparatus was designed so that the water vapour entered the reaction site immediately and directly as a comparison of the two figures will illustrate. Experimental Proce Jure The synthesis chamber used in the present investigation is shown in Figure 2 and consists of three sections: the bottom \"water chamber,\" the central \"synthesis chamber,\" and the top \"allyn condenser.\" It was made"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"of Pyrex, 914 rnm in length, with an O.D. of 70 rnrn and an I.D. of 63.5 mm, giving a volume of order 2.9~103 m3. The desired increased pressure (-2 atmospheres) in the system is an inevitable condition of the closed system, while the placement of the condenser on top of the syn- thesis chamber guarantees a high water vapor pressure at the reaction site. Gentle heating (just below boiling) provided by an electrically-regu- lated heating tape, allowed the water and gas molecules to circulate in the region of the discharge for a longer period of time, as compared to Miller's system. Water flow through the condenser was about 30 cm3 s-1 at 16-20°C. Lightning discharges were simulated in all nine experiments with a 50 kV RF Tesla coil of nominal frequency 500 kHz. Due to elec- tric dissociation of the methane and ammonia gases by the discharge, resulting in the production of free hydrogen, only thesetwo gases were added in equal volume. Figure 2. Present Synthesis Chamber [2] 26"},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"Fixed magnets provided field strengths of 390 and 950 gauss, which changed the Larmor precessional frequency for protons from 1.65 MHz in the first case, to 4.02 MHz in the second case. Using this design and conditions, it was found experimentally that only fifteen hours of opera- tion (as opposed to seven days) were needed to produce the results achieved. The precessional frequency induced by the fixed magnets was matched by an RF frequency provided by a radio frequency generator that was used to superimfiose a second RF field at right angles to the magnets. The RF supply drove a coil affixed to the outside of the appara- tus and parallel to the discharge site (not shown in Figure 2). Power dis- sipation into the synthesis site provided by the generator was 120-150 mW. Careful regulation of the water temperature below the boiling point is important to prevent excessive pressure in the chamber. Discussion of Results All runs yielded the same amino acids as obtained by Miller but a num- ber of others were also identified, including isoleucine, serine, tyrosine, glutarnic acid and aspartic acid, as analyzed by TLC (thin layer chro- matography) methods. In addition to the amino acids produced, polypeptides on the order of 1-2x103 g cm3 were produced in 5 runs using the 390 gauss magnetic field, with larger amounts on the order of 7x103 g cm3 produced with the 950 gauss field and the EM coil operating at 1.6 MHz. In contrast, the run using a 500 kHz discharge with the 950 gauss field only produced 2x10-3 g cm-3 of polypeptides demonstrating that the frequency of the applied field has a pronounced effect on the polypeptide generation. Polypeptide and peptide analysis was accomplished through the use of a Hitachi 91 1 Auto Chemical Analyzer (HACA). The addition of elemental sulfur to two runs yielded only peptides. Sulfur possibly competed for binding sites with the peptides formed, preventing the formation of the higher-ordered compounds. Peptide production re- sulting from the 390 gauss field at 500 kHz was measured at 1-3~10-~ g cm3 with the increased amounts being produced for the 950 gauss field and the coil operating at 1.6 MHz. The above results demonstrate that the radio frequency electric fields associated with lightning discharges occurring on primordial earth played a more significant role in the generation of those compounds needed for life to arise, than was formerly thought possible.

Ephesus now lies in ruins along the western coast of Turkey. But in the days of Saul it was one of the major cities of the Roman. Empire, an economic and cultural hub dominated by ven'eration of the multi-breasted, fecund goddess Artemis. To a modem reader, it may seem strange that a virgin goddess should embody fertility for millions of worshipers. But the whole point was the enormous power of creating life that women and women alone possessed and controlled. Saul, who was quoted as saying women should be wholly subservient to men and not even speak in public, obviously held a dim view of such elevation of womanhood as the Artemis cult represented. His attitude was noted by the local population, who poured into the streets to protest his attack on their civil institutions, with cries of \"Artemis is Great!\" Saul was a zealous sort. He had been zealous as a Pharisaic Jew attacking the new Christian movement, and he became just as zealous as a Chris- tian attacking Pharisaic Juddsm, which he now declared totally invalid. He was subject to seizures, during which he had what he considered direct communications from the spirit world. These convinced him not only to join the new Christian movement, but to direct it out of Judaism into direct engagement with followers of non-Jewish spirituality. You"},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"can search through every word ascribed to Yeshu the Galilean, and find not a single remark directed against forms of worship outside of Judaism. His Nazorean movement seems to have been primarily an internal reform of Jewish practices. But Saul felt himself instructed to \"evangelize\" the non-Jewish world. He dropped his Jewish name and took the Roman name Paulus, and began to travel from city to city spreading the \"good news,\" which could be boiled down to four noble truths: 1. God is not in the world as a living force, but created the world apart from himself. The world therefore is alienated from the divine and has no value. The forces of nature are not divine, but demonic. 2. The physical body is compt and separate from the true person. The processes of sex, birth, and death are not a blessing but a curse marked by mortality. 3. God has created this world for destruction, and allows bad things to happen within it as a \"test.\" The spiritual forces that respond to people's worldly concerns for life, love, safe childbirth, health, safe travel, pros- perity, and success are therefore also demonic, not divine. 4. All that one should care about is escaping this world for a heaven where one is not plagued by the processes of life and death, not bothered by plants or animals, but spends a sexless eternity praising God. \"Paul\" brought from his Jewish heritage the idea that there was only one God, a great and wrathful patriarch with a serious case of Narcissism. There was no room left within this rigid monotheism for a goddess, or for any of the natural processes of birth and generation that necessarily require feminine assistance. The one God creates by giving orders and the occasional hands-on craftsmanship. Creation is a set of distinct objects molded by God's whim, not a web of interconnected being. People did to Paul what just about anyone would do to someone who went around shouting that everyone was a fool, that the gods did not exist, that the principal traditions of the people were wicked-they beat the crap out of him, several times. The local police often hauled him away for disturbing the peace and inciting riot--often for his own protec- tion. This was, of course, \"persecution,\" even at a time when there was no constitutional right to free speech. There was, however, freedom of religion in the Roman Empire. Modern textbooks immured in Christian bias wildly distort this fact, and regularly depict Rome as a trial-run for Nazi Germany. The truth is, Roman society was such a model of enlightened governance that it was"},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"taken as the primary model for the United States when it was founded. The Romans believed in keeping government small. An army was needed to protect people from invaders and gangs, basically to defend \"the Roman way of life.\" Since the army needed to be paid, taxes had to be collected. If people paid their taxes and kept the peace, they could do anything else they liked. They could spend every day in a temple, or every day in a bordello. They could believe what they wanted, and follow a personal ethical code of their choice, so long as it did not infringe on anyone else's right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. Every once in awhile someone would get into power with some peculiar notions of giving the government a bigger hand in everyday life. But such exper- iments at \"social engineering\" were short-lived-usually as short-lived as the person who tried to make them law. The Empire was also very cosmopolitan, with people of every race and color living side by side in the cities, each with as much opportunity as the next person to rise high in business, culture, or government. Freedom of religion in the Roman Empire was qualified in two ways. First, technically there was no separation of religion and government. The government supervised religious institutions, making sure no one made off with the temple funds. It also sponsored religion with tax money, pretty even-handedly. This made sense because temples were the center of civil life. They sponsored feasts, festivals, parades, theater, local building projects, and charity. So they were the best avenue for the government to use to invest in the cities, which were, of course, the government's political base. Second, in a small town or village, one's spiritual options were somewhat limited. \"The family that prays together stays together\" was a common sentiment, and that idea extended to the whole community. Only in the big cities was there enough diversity for people to experiment with something other than the faith of their mothers. The big cities were precisely Paul's targeted mission field for this reason, and from the very beginning the Christians were accused of being a cult that broke up families and undermined traditional values. Paul's method is familiar to anyone who knows how new religions and ' cults work. He claimed to have direct revelations from the true God. And his verbal attack on traditional values--combined with dire warnings of a dark future-shook his audience's confidence that they were on the right path in life. Anyone who approached Paul and his team with interest was floodedwith love, generosity, and a feeling of belonging. At the same time, Paul instructed the new recruit to stop participating in normal social"},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"life: to not attend public festivals or other social functions connected to his or her old way of life, and not to see friends, family, and neighbors. The Christians formed a \"new family,\" in which everyone was a \"brother\" or \"sister.\" The new recruit would be constantly accompanied by these spiritual kin, to be monitored and encouraged in the new way of life. Any serious breach would be met with curses and shunning from the group until he or she repented. The way of looking at nature and the world's value taught in the mysteries was systematically drummed out of the recruit's mind. Past ethical principles and values were declared worthless, and the person was put through an initiation designed to in- duce spirit-possession. The new spirit was thought to take possession of a person's mind, and guide him or her instinctively to behave in confor- mity with the Christian message. Believers were kept in a constant state of fervor and anxiety by the message that the world would be destroyed any day, and only true believers would be rescued. They quit their jobs, broke engagements to marry, and met in all-night sessions of prophecy and speaking in tongues. Some were so driven to distraction by the delay of the world's end that they sought to force it by setting fire to Rome it- self. Thousands were killed as the poorer sections of the city were re- duced to ashes. Several Christian ringleaders, no doubt along with a handful of innocent bystanders, were rounded up and publicly executed by the state. Another \"great persecution.\" The original followers of Yeshu the Galilean, led by his brother Yaqob, were appalled at Paul's practices. They sent their own missionaries wherever Paul had been to undo some of the damage and let people know the actual content of Yeshu's message of love and non-violence. We don't know exactly how Paul's version of the religion prevailed, but it did. Perhaps it is the simple fact that fanaticism always has an advantage over tolerance because it does not rule out any tactic in advancing its goals. Paul's success set Christianity on a path of violent confrontation with the Mysteries. Within a hundred years of Paul's activities, Christianity had become a notorious cult. People had had enough exposure-to Christians to under- stand what they were all about. They were quite simply \"atheists,\" who did not believe in the gods who filled the world and governed all of its life-sustaining energies. And because service to the gods was a collective responsibility, one bad apple in a village could profane the sacred realm, and break the partnership with the gods on which everyday life de- pended. This was viewed as a direct threat to everyone's well-being."},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"Naturally, then, people took matters into their own hands to harass, drive out, and even lynch an atheist Christian. In cities where the rule of law prevailed, those Christians who publicly profaned and flaunted the sacred were arrested. If they recanted their hatred of the gods, they were pardoned. If they persisted, they were executed. This quickly devolved into ritual suicide on the part of the Christians, who deliberately incited arrest and prosecution to more quickly escape the evil world. Of all the things pondered by the penetrating mind of Marcus Aurelius, this willful suicide and disdain for life was something he said he could not fathom. This whole period is perversely called the time of the \"Apologists\" by Christian historians, who claim that Christian leaders sought to explain themselves politely to the surrounding society. The few \"Apologies\" that survive from this time paint a very different picture. Even though they ask for Christians to be protected by the state from their neighbors, they include virulent attacks on the beliefs and values of those neighbors, declaring everything they believe and do to be foolish and false. These documents also represent a new phase in the Christian war, specifically on the Mysteries. In the Second and early Third centuries, Christian writers began to publicly profane the Mysteries by revealing the secret experiences one had when initiated into them. Since many of these Christian writers had converted from traditional religion, they had actually gone through the Mysteries, and vowed never to speak or even hint about their content. Now they violated their oaths and sought to ridicule the Mystery experience by mentioning certain things that went on there totally out of context. The Mysteries, you see, were not a set of teachings, a laundry list of ideas, or merely a ritual procedure. The Mysteries worked as total expe- riences in which the initiate's mind is prepared and carefully manipulated into intuitively perceiving the significance of sights, sounds, smells, tastes, and sensations that in ordinary experience and the plain light of day would be perfectly ordinary. The so-called \"Apologists\" of Chris- tianity, now de-programmed from their Mystery initiation, disassembled its constituent parts and ridiculed them as \"all there is to the Mysteries.\" Since modem historians mostly rely on such sources to reconstruct the mysteries, there has been a serious problem grasping their inner meaning. Fortunately, there are threads of this meaning running through the spiri- tual traditions that became embedded in later forms of religion, and the discerning eye can see connections to the fragments of direct evidence about the Mysteries."},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"The profaning of the Mysteries started to have serious consequences for Mediterranean society.

Despite being an illegal gang bent on the destruction of the w I state and society, Christianity attracted a following. The society started to 1 I come apart. Christians tapped into class tensions. They recruited heavily in the army where young men were far from home. While attacking the Mithra Mysteries popular with soldiers, they copied some of its ritual forms to maintain the atmosphere of a familiar club. And whenever they could, they committed public acts of impiety and desecration. Inevitably, the gods abandoned Rome. The Empire collapsed internally and exter- nally. Invaders pillaged hundreds of cities. The great Roman army split into factions and devastated the countryside. The leaders called for I I everyone to return to the gods, to make offerings and pray for peace and I safety once again. Some Christians sought public suicide once again. Others, more comfortable with worldly success, bribed government offi- cials to issue false certificates of sacrifice that they could wave in front of their neighbors while pretending to be on the same side. The campaigns of traditional piety did nothing to reverse the collapse of civil society. And so, in desperation, the leaders of Roman society turned to a dictator to restore stability. Diocletian is another one of those Emperors who has gone down in his- tory as a great \"persecutor\" of the Christians. What is forgotten was that he was a persecutor of just about everyone. He decided to balance the state budget on the backs of the temples. He cut off government support for all temples outside of the four imperial cities and, by greatly increas- ing taxes, he drained the resources that might have supported the temples locally. Since traditional religion had always been closely interrelated to civil government, first locally, then nationally, then imperially, Diocle- tian's policy was an amputation at the neck for all traditional religion in the Empire. He hated everything \"un-Roman,\" and confiscated the operating accounts of Egyptian, Syrian, Phrygian, and Celtic temples. He ordered the execution of any missionary bringing spiritual teachings from outside the Empire, from Persia or India. Finally, he turned on the Chris- tians, confiscating their money and property, burning their books, and sending their leaders off to labor camps. In doing so, he did Christianity a big favor. Since he was so widely hated by such a huge segment of the population, his antagonism made Christianity popular. Isis worshipers"},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"ambushed police convoys to free Christian prisoners. For a brief time of common adversity, people of many different religions made common cause. This mood prevailed in the years following Diocletian, and led to the rise of Constantine the Great. Once again the history books, deep in Christian bias, have it wrong. Constantine was not \"the first Christian Emperor,\" and he did not \"make Christianity the state religion.\" These are fictions meant to push the vic- tory of ~hristianity back in lime. Constantine was an initiate of the Mithra Mysteries, and a devotee of the Unconquerable Sun, Sol Invictus. He was, in fact, an early practitioner of what today we would call \"New Age\" religion, because he felt that all religions contain parts of the same truth, and he selected the most appealing features of each and wove them into a personal faith of his own. The Christians, like everyone else, received official acceptance, and for the first time were considered mem- bers of a religion, rather than a socially destructive atheist secret society. Astute Christian leaders cooperated with Constantine in guiding the movement towards mainstream status. That meant they needed temples, priests, public worship, holy days, and multiple forms of the divine to appeal to. At this moment, in the early Fourth century, Christianity adopted all of these things, and began to look like a respectable religion. For the first time, they demarcated areas of sacred space and furnished them as if they were temples with standard sacrificial rites. They imitated traditional ritual, imagery, and music, and dressed their leaders in the robes of priestcraft. They adopted the common concept of a triune divine family of transcendent Father, immanent Mother, and beloved Son, adapting it by replacing the Mother with a sexless divine Spirit. When this failed to appear to the masses, they promoted Mary as the new form of the Mother Goddess. Finally, and most crucially, they transformed the simple Christian initiation of baptism into an elaborate Mystery, with all of the usual preparation and stage management necessary to produce an experience of insight, now that the activity of the possessing Spirit seems to have waned in direct proportion to the popularity of the faith. The tone of Christian rhetoric changed dramatically. Dropping the harsh attacks on traditional religion and the Mysteries, Christian writers began to show how the Mysteries were part of God's plan to educate humanity and prepare it for the final great Mystery that Christianity offered. Every symbol, every insight was explained as leading up to the best Mystery of all. Constantine was praised by Christian leaders as a god on earth, as the second coming of the Messiah, as God's instrument to govern the whole world in a new era of peace. He built a fantastic new city in which he"},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"built temples to abstract principles that could embody many gods together. He filled the city with the finest representations of every god and goddess (though modem textbook perpetuate the Christian myth that Constantinople was a purely \"Christian\" city). It truly did seem like uni- versal tolerance and harmony would prevail. But underneath, the con- spiracy continued to eventually undermine and displace all rival spiritu- alities in the cause of the truth that Christianity alone possessed. Constantine became more and more a pawn in the hands of a few unscru- pulous Christian leaders. He was pushed into executing his young second wife and his eldest son on trumped up charges of an affair between them. Then his guilt over the deed was played upon to make him malleable in the hands of those who could promise him God's forgiveness. When rev- enues fell short, he was encouraged to plunder the few remaining temple treasuries untouched by Diocletian. His mother had become a full blown believer, and told her son that the Christian God had revealed to her sev- eral sites sacred to him. Constantine appropriated these sites, which were various sacred caves and groves around Jerusalem, and built churches upon them. His mother also \"miraculously\" discovered various sacred relics that became objects of worship, such as the cross on which Jesus was executed by the Romans three hundred years earlier. So, by a com- bination of adaptation and appropriation, Christianity made serious in- roads into public life, displacing the traditional Mysteries. In his old age, Constantine fell increasingly under the spell of a closed circle of the conspirators around him. He gave Christian leaders free use of the government courier system. He exempted them from certain taxes and civic responsibilities. In return, they fed his delusions of divinity and convinced him he could conquer the world if his armies were led by a rebuilt Ark of the Covenant. Only death forestalled the testing of this promise. In his will, Constantine treated the Empire itself with disdain, parceling it out among his three sons and two nephews as personal fief- doms. The Christian sons immediately disposed of the non-Christian nephews, and began to undermine dramaticdly the tolerance their father had maintained. The harsher policy bred revoli in Rome, but the sole surviving son, Constantius, prevailed, and instituted even more severe measures. Sacrifice was prohibited and the major city temples closed to religious observances. Christian leaders were given increasing powers and privileges.

A brief reprieve for traditional religion came with the revolt of Julian, sole survivor of the slaughtered non-Christian line of Constantine's dynasty. Taken from his home, he had been indoctrinated as a Christian and forced to prepare for the priesthood. Secretly, he studied the old ways, and was initiated into all the Mysteries. Given a military command in a desperate hour by the Emperor Constantius, he performed mar- velously. But when word of his true spiritual inclinations leaked out, and he was recalled to Constantinople, his troops hoisted him on their shields and declared him Emperor, pledging their lives to displace the hated Constantius. Constantius conveniently died, leaving the way open to the energetic young conqueror. The whole Roman world, with the exception of the Christians, celebrated his ascent to power. He publicly declared his commitment to the old gods, and set about reorganizing and refunding their worship throughout the Empire. He introduced teacher testing, root- ing out any teacher who used the classroom as a place to attack tradi- tional culture. He delivered public speeches and published tracts compar- ing Christianity unfavorably to the Mysteries, and he wrote moving hymns reflecting his own spiritual devotion. He also recalled from exile all Christian leaders driven out by previous infighting, restoring them to their positions and property. He calculated, rightly, that Christians were their own worst enemy, and that they would fight and argue among themselves perpetually if no side could use government power against the others. A couple of the most obnoxious and abusive bishops were attacked in the streets by mobs and lynched in retaliation for the wanton acts of desecration they had perpetrated under the indulgent previous -regime. When Julian came to Antioch to prepare an invasion of Persia, local Christians set fire to a major temple in the region, then complained bitterly when one of their churches was temporarily closed in retaliation. Julian gave permission and funds to the Jews to rebuild the Temple in Jerusalem. But Christian gangs attacked the construction works in the night, and torched the site. In time, Julian might have resorted to harsher measures and punishments to bring the Christians in line. But after only three short years, he had had enough taste of trying to govern hostile Christians to prefer the relative quiet of war.

Julian was the last openly non-Christian Emperor of Rome. His death marked the beginning of the triumph of Christianity over the force of the Mysteries. With each successive administration, traditional religion was whittled away. At first, only overtly magical rituals were banned, and the Mysteries continued. But in the 380s the co-rulers Gratian and Theodo- sius brought a new level of fanaticism to an Empire that could ill afford it. They refused to take the oath as Pontifex Maximus, by which they were bound to manage and protect all religious institutions in the Empire. They removed the altar of victory from the Roman senate house. They stripped Jews and Manichaeans of their legal rights, confiscated their property, and drew up long lists of outlawed varieties of Christianity itself, driving thousands from the cities. This only served their need for resources by which to support the form of faith they chose to sanction, (Catholic/Orthodox Christianity), which up until now had been decidedly , in the minority. They closed all the temples, and appropriated all temple funds. The Mysteries were suspended. Finally, they drove traditional religion out of public life altoge,ther and proposed, although the means were not at their disposal, to root it even out of the home. Non-conformist Christians and traditionalists formed an odd alliance that disposed of Gratian and freed Rome temporarily from this oppressive regime. Theodosius set out to crush the revolt and, not trusting Roman troops in this fight, hired a mercenary army of Goths. The opposing armies met at Frigidus in northern Italy, the standards of Jupiter against the standards of Christ. For two days the future of the West hung in the balance. In the end, the hastily gathered Roman forces could not match the tough mercenaries of Theodosius. For the next century and a half, Christianity dug ever deeper into the native soil. Temples were systematically confiscated and converted into churches. Legends were created of how the local \"demon\" was driven out by the power of a priest or monk. Sacred trees were cut down, sacred springs sealed or polluted. A mob of monks attacked the great Museon in Alexandria, pulling down the statue of Serapis who oversaw the four thousand year old Egyptian Mysteries, and burning its Library to the ground. Later Christian historians fabricated contradictory stories of the Library being burned by Julius Caesar four hundred years earlier, or by the Muslims three hundred years later, to cover up responsibility in this devastating loss of ancient wisdom. Christianity had entered a period of"},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"all-out assault on traditional religion and the Mysteries. Having seized control of the cities, they labeled all traditionalists \"pagans\" or country- folk. The cultured classes willingly gave up the cities for life in the country where they could practice their traditional religion in peace, and closer to the nature that embodied it. As a result, civic life all but ceased. The cities became ghost towns where only churches and their dependents remained. Imperial legislation was ignored and unenforced in most rural areas. Though the MysteriCs were a thing of the past, the memory of them and the worldview they offered was preserved in the resistance literature of the Fifth and Sixth centuries, which passed itself off as commentaries on the classics or antiquarian studies. The victory of Christianity was the death of the Roman world. The disaf- fected country landholders welcomed Gothic and German invaders and formed new nations with them. The Empire struck back under Justinian in the mid-Fifth century. He recaptured Rome and Carthage. He closed the university in Athens, the last non-Christian center of learning. He shut down the last large operating temple, that of Isis at Philae at the bor- der with Nubia. He burned whole villages with their inhabitants to the ground because they held on to \"paganism\" or some variety of Christian- ity he refused to recognize. On paper, he seemed to reconstitute the Empire of old on a new Christian footing. But his actions only bred hatred and resistance. The Egyptian and Syrian Christians rejected his interpretation of Christianity, while the countryside seethed with rebel- lion. Within a century of his death, the much more tolerant Muslims had seized control of the Middle East, greeted by jubilant crowds as libera- tors, an ironic scenario from the contemporary Western perspective. The deeply embedded thinking of the Mysteries found new clothing in eso- teric teachings of the Monophysite Christians, and in the practices of the Islamic Sufis. European traditionalists also hung on, sometimes wrapping beliefs and practices in Christian garb, other times celebrating them in all their raw \"paganism.\" One by one, Christianity won control of the ruling classes of the new European nations, but the imposition of the faith on the common people varied with the whim of individual rulers. Only in the Twelfth century did Catholicism start to make serious inroads into rural life in Europe, and only with puritanical Protestantism and the age of witch-burning did Christianity seal the tomb of the last remnants of the old religion. But the Mysteries in their original form were long since silenced. Only echoes in fragmented ritual, songs, and folk tales carried hints of long-"},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"forgotten views.

Consider the circumcision of male infants as a social \"norm.\" Normative: Conforming to the established (dogmatic) language usage of educated speakers in a given society. Synonym = prescriptive. Consider that if the police ask you a question, regardless of its absurdity, you must I answer. \"Yes or no, did you use a knife to kill your neighbor?\" This is an ' ill-formed question; it presupposes that you killed your neighbor. Prescriptive: Based on or prescribing a norm or standard (non-observ- able suppositions); giving directives or rules: Art & fashion, law, mores, common sense. Presupposition: Reasoning that involves the formation of conclusions from incomplete evidence. Empiric: Regarding an objective collection of data points (evidence) for the synthesis of suppositions. Empirical: Derived from observation and experiment rather than theory; capable of being tested (falsified or verified) by experiment or observa- tion. Synonym = data-based. Antonym = theoretical.

Thus, the words and sentence structures with which one speaks and thinks creates and manifests his reality. Language communicates information (descrip- tivelempirical function), and it also coordinates and directs behaviors by stirring feelings like wellness, guilt, pride, and shame (prescriptivelnor- mative function). In the case of hypnosis, my reality, as expressed by the words I use, may alter your reality if you accept the words and phrases I speak to you. Accepting the words of a statement or question need not occur con- sciously, and in fact, it rarely does. Hopefully, the gentle reader already has a decent level of skill in detecting and rejecting obviously false, or ill formed statements such as: \"The earth is flat.\"[False, see NASA photo- graphs of earth] or \"Jesus is my lord and savior.\" [Ill-formed, cannot be tested empirically]. I find it relatively simple to detect the ill-formed-ness of a statement. However, an ill-formed question, especially if posed by someone that you consider an authority figure, or if posed in a violent or accusatory manner, may prove more difficult to detect. Adrenaline mercilessly slays analytical and cognitive ability, sending one quickly to the irrational animal mind where ill-formed language is likely to be accepted whole- sale. Without analysis and rational cognition, ill-formed questions and statements are accepted and internalized, thereby forming ones reality - without detection. This is a form of hypnosis. The Question Game: The Inquisition. \"A question as a question is simply a question; however, for most monkeys a question has tension and freezes the brain.. . . . . 99 - Dr. Hyatt"},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"Mother/father/god/cop/judge/priest asks a question, and the childlparish- ioner/heretic/infideVcriminal answers. The first question to ask is: Is the question answerable? Are all the terms in the question capable of some empirical (i.e., non-normative) definition? Whoever asks this type of moral question expressed in normative grammar is playing a \"one up game\" in which they presuppose themselves as the deity (moral author- ity). A whole host of other presuppositions may be present in the lan- guage structure of the queition,-and upon answering the question, the child/parishioner/heretic/infidel/criminal accepts the presuppositions as true, and validates the irrational stance of the inquisitor. You must learn to avoid switching over to fight-or-flight response, and you must learn to spot poorly formed questions. Rvoid Chemical Rrcrin Freeze Some people can ask questions of you and you simply answer. Other people (e.g., spouse, police, parent, priest, combatant, etc.) may ask a question and instantly send you into a \"chemical brain freeze,\" also known as fight-or-flight. The major key in avoiding brain freeze is to remain calm and detached, which can be nearly impossible in some cir- cumstances. However, like all good personality change, it will take effort, time & patience. Train yourself to make your initial response to any question calm and patient. Your first response to any question then should be the following: 1. Take three deep breaths, hold each breath for a few seconds, and then gently release. The inquisitor will likely become impatient and fidgety, or may even become more agitated. Do not allow this to affect you. You will answer the question if and when you choose. Focus on the feeling of the breaths. 2. Smile: This will send signals to you brain that relax you and enhance cognition. Fake it if necessary. It should feel and look genuine-avoid the \"devil's grimace.\" 3. Detach: Force yourself to stop experiencing this as a threat. This will require effort and work on your part. 4. Analyze: If you have successfully avoided the Sympathetic Nervous System response (fight-or-flight = adrenaline), you are ready to move on to analysis. Analyze these 3 points when considering a question put to you: a. What physical signals does the inquisitor exhibit? 43"},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"Pupils dilated means the target is adrenalized and ready for battle. Pointing fingers, shrugged shoulders, or any extreme gesticulation sig- nals that an emotional response is occurring (emotions don't mix with calm cool analysis).

Pulse rate and blood pressure often takes a moderate level of skill to dis- cern, but you can easily notice if veins are bulging on the side of the headlface or neck (high blood pressure), and the pulse can often be seen in the carotid artery alongside the neck, especially if the target is aroused. Flared nostrils and rapid, shallow breathing are also signs of emotional arousal/distress. b. What, if any, are the presuppositions of the question? Presupposition is probably the most common hypnotic technique used in manipulative language. Study presuppositions. Below are a few basic examples of pre- supposition. See if you can spot the presupposed ideations: (1) How often do you beat your wife? (2) When will you call me? (3) How often do you use drugs? c. Are the terms of the question definable empirically? Do you love me? This cannot be tested empirically. There is no way to measure or observe love. \"Have you accepted the Lord Jesus Christ as your savior?\" Same as above, since there is no way to prove or disprove. \"Why are you like this?\" \"This\" is a vague pronoun, and could mean anything. \"Do you believe in American values and the verity of justice?\" This question essentially means nothing, but it looks great on paper. Keep in mind that many people will ask questions only to demonstrate their authoritative knowledge of a subject area. These people are severe time wasters, loaded with hair-splitting questions so they may show off their metapuke superiority. If you suspect this may be the case, respond to the questions with questions. Turn the haughty self-aggrandizing rub- bish back on the inquisitor.

Establishing Rapport with the Target If you want to get along with someone, learn when to ask the right ques- tions. The right question at the right time shows interest. The wrong questionvat the wrong time willbe perceived as an attack! A question always asks something of the target. At the very least, a question is the act of asking for a response from the target. Thus, a question is a con- frontation of wills. To get along with someone, your will must appear to be identical to, or at least parallel to, the will of the target. Consider the beauty you'd like to take home tonight. Any good hunter knows that patience and the ability to plan for the future will yield the best results. If her will is to avoid you at all costs, you will establish rapport more quickly if it appears that you wish to avoid her at all costs. Otherwise, you just bother her. Likewise, consider that interview for the job you really want. You are a staunch conservative, while the big boss is a hardcore liberal. If you want to have a great conversation and a new job, you will appear liberal as well. This doesn't mean you agree with everything the target says; rather, a little engagement will make you appear lively. However, the target's ego must be made to feel special while in your presence. Thus, your presence will be desired. Along with the right questions, mimicking the target's posture, manner- isms, and tone of voice, at least initially, establishes rapport (leading). Then, as you alter your mirroring of them, they will mimic you (pacing). All this must be done very slowly and with greatest patience and ease. Also, note the output phraseology of the target. If it is speaking about visual data, and using visual statements, respond in kind. The same applies to auditory and kinesthetic statements as shown below: Visual target output: \"I look forward to brightening up our company's reputation. I hope you're the man for the job.\" Practitioner responds in visual phraseology: \"Yes sir, I see things your way, and with your visionary guidance, I'm confident that I can shed light on the problem areas.\" Audio target output: \"I've heard a lot of good things about you.

We spend about 65,000 of our 100,000 waking hours involved in solitary activities, and in direct informal relationships with family and friends, and these activities play a major role in the development and mainte- nance of important personal memories.

Further, computer programs and TV editing techniques tend to compress, extend, and distort normal timelspace relationships, a critically important element in the creation and use of effective long-term memories. 1. A relatively slow, analytic, reflective system (thalamus-hippocampus- cortex circuitry) explores the more objective factual elements of a situa- tion, compares them wi,th related declarative memories, and then re- sponds.

User-friendly computer programs and non- frantic TV programming tend to use this rational system. 2. A fast conceptual, reflexive system (thalamus-amygdala-cerebellum circuitry) identifies the fearful and survival elements in a situation, and quickly activates automatic response patterns (procedural memory) if survival seems problematic. The fast system developed through natural selection to respond to immi- nent predatory danger and fleeting feeding and mating opportunities. It thus focuses on any loud/loominglcontrastinglmovinglobnoxiouslattrac- tive elements that might signal potential danger, food, andor mates. The system thus enhances survival, but its rapid super-fkial analysis often *. leads us to respond fearfully, impulsively, and inappropriately to situa- tions that didn't require an immediate response (regrets and apologies often follow). Stereotyping and prejudice are but two of the prices we humans pay for this powerful survival system. Worse, fear can strengthen the emotional and weaken the factual memories of an event.

Excessive TV viewing, one of the most passive visual activities, can s&iously impair a child's observational skills. Viewing affects not only eye mechanics, but also the ability to focus and pay attention. Since TV is more visual than auditory, children's sense of hearing is not being fully exercised. Active listening is a skill that needs to be devel- oped. Children need practice in processing auditory stimulation, making their own mental pictures in response to what they hear. Also, when TV is constantly on, the sense of hearing may be dulled by the persistent background noise. I Sense of Wonder The subtle rhythms and patterns of life's wonders which can only be appreciated through patient observation and experience will hold little interest for a child given a steady diet of TV. The fast paced, action- packed, high drama which is programmed to keep viewers tuned in does not accurately represent the natural world, yet it is what children come to expect. Real experiences, therefore, can't compete with TV and the child's sense of wonder is dulled.

A great many studies have documented declining literacy rates over the last thirty years. TV viewing is an easier and preferred activity compared to the challenge of book reading, especially for children who have not yet developed fluent reading skills. TV requires little concentration, de- focuses the mind, offers ele_ctronically produced images, and encourages passivity, while reading necessitates concentration, thought, focusing, and the ability to visualize. Television trains short attention spans, while reading trains long attention spans. Studies suggest that light viewers learn to read more easily than heavy viewers. Research into brain wave patterns confirm these differences. Studies of both children's and adults' brain wave patterns while viewing TV confirm that brain activity switches from beta (indicating alert and conscious attention) to alpha waves within thirty seconds of turning the set on. Greatly increased alpha waves resulted regardless of whether children were interested in the pro- gram or not. The electrical responses of the brain while viewing resemble those which do not normally occur when the eyes are open. I Effects on Creativity and lrnaqination Boredom is the empty space necessary for creativity. With TV filling a child's leisure moments, the necessary void is never experienced. Addi- tionally, the child's play is often restricted to forms prescribed by adult programmers whose primary objective is to sell toys. With pre-deter- mined themes and ready-made playthings, little is left to the imagination. . Furthermore, when children are bombarded with TV images, their own ability to form imaginative pictures becomes severely impaired. This process of generating internal pictures is critical to the development of dendrites and neural connectors which lay the foundation for intelligence and creativity. Studies which have investigated how TV viewing affects performance in creative problem-solving suggest that excessive viewing may lead to decreased attention, persistence, and tolerance. The displace- ment of problem-solving opportunities also results in a more limited repertoire of creative solutions. blfects on Socinl Development Television is not a substitute for meeting and interacting with real people in real situations. A child cannot develop a sense of self in the absence of contact with others. While viewing, a child is not gaining practice in"},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"1 relating to others, and in constructive interpersonal problem-solving. Furthermore, most TV problems are framed in oversimplified, black- white thinking and resolved, often violently, in one hour (less commer- cial breaks). Findings have consistently demonstrated that violence on TV correlates with subsequent aggressive behavior. Recent evidence from an extensive longitudinal study carried out in four different countries suggests there is a sensitive period that begins before age eight when children are especially susceptible to the effects of violence shown on TV. Effects on Perceptions of Reality Heavy TV viewers develop a distorted sense of reality. Most notable may be an exaggerated perception of the prevalence of violence in society, which comes from an over-representation of violent acts in programs. (The frequency of violence in children's programs is six times greater than that of adult^').^ Put this book down and take that walk before you read another word. No, really. I see that you're back.

Wait, I have a few more things to say before I get to that. I'm getting there, hang on. I want to talk about video games and on-line games for a minute. Tripping the Photon Phantastic .- - Immersive gaming is in the tradition of psychonautic and cybernautic exploration. But while its connections to the supermind and cyberpunk are fairly clear, does the gaming experience really compare in intensity of experience or effect to what is suggested as the first historical coun- terpart, the radical reality-estrangement of taking psychedelic drugs? Study Links Aggressive Adults, TV Viewing, Malcolm Ritter 60"},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"consider a typical trip report: \"It was as if my room were reduced to a 2-dimensional picture which was subsequently torn to confetti and thrown into a blender. My head was attached to R's arm. My foot is ,ticking out of the wall, next to a book which had somehow fused with my alarm clock. All concept of space, time, and direction are scrambled. '1' is not even a vaguely remembered concept. Ultimate chaos. Ultimate fear.\" Certainly, this reaction is more severe than a typical gamer's as I have described it above. Yet, the estrangement from customary con- sciousness and social relations that immersive gaming provides has, I believe, a few potential advantages over psychedelic drugs and the earlier cyberpunk movement in generating lasting change in subjectivity. First, in terms of attracting new explorers, games can provide a much less frightening and more seductively pleasant path than psychedelic drugs. With gaming, there is not only less of a perceived physical risk, and therefore less of an impeding fear factor, but also less intention required on the part of the participant. Many non-evolutionary-minded players, ostensibly in search of simple entertainment, find themselves inadvertently implicated in and motivated by the opportunity for new modes of human being."},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"This increased availability of prospective participants is compounded by the opportunity for extended simultaneous exploration among immersive garners. Although web sites such as lyceaum.org and thedrugsindex.org have taken advantage of digital technology to allow for greater distribu- tion of knowledge on where to obtain, how to prepare, or how to endure psychedelic drugs, these forums do not yet orchestrate real-time commu- nities of simultaneous exploration. Immersive gaming, on the other hand, provides numerous opportunities for massively multi-player simultane- ous gaming, connecting thousands of players in live online and offline communities. To this extent, immersive gaming has succeeded in engi- neering huge and widely distributed networks of experience, whereas psychonauts have been limited to comparatively local exploration. This distribution is important not only for potential outreach, but also for cre- ating the large-scale feedback systems and contextual reinforcement nec- essary for sustained and group-directed change. It also, through sheer magnitude of mind share, exponentially heightens the potential subjec- tive multiplicity. Another potential strength of immersive gaming as an agent for change is the absence of a \"coming down\" factor. With psychedelic drugs, users return from a totally alternate reality to an everyday reality that looks, sounds, and feels like the pre-trip world. Things in this \"real world\" exist in contrast to the experience of the trip. The user may feel irrevocably changed, perhaps mentally or spiritually, by the experience, but the everyday world itself has not been substantially altered. In a Web docu- ment entitled \"Psychedelic Experience F.A.Q\", first-time users are ad- vised of numerous \"post-effects\" that accompany psychedelic experimen- tation, including \"disorientation\" and \"insights\"; they are assured, how- ever, that \"All the following effects share one characteristic: their fre- quency and/or intensity decreases with time. Fully returning to baseline usually takes around one month, although most of these disappear en- tirely within a week.\" For immersive garners, on the other hand, the everyday world is so much a part of the alternate reality they experience, the player never \"comes down\" from theexperience. The game world is not set in contrast to everyday life, so \"post-effects\" persist indefinitely in non-game life.4 \"This Zs Not a Game\": Collective Subjectivity and Immersive Enter- tainment Jane McGonigal.

An expanded definition of rhetoric is expressed as \"the management of symbols in order to coordinate social action.\" (Hauser, 1986) Popular discourse also refers to the product of thii management as \"rhetoric.\" Rhetorical analy- sis stresses the interpretation of artifacts from a rhetorical perspective, and by focusing on the interpretation of the artifact, distances itself from questions of authorial intent. Feminist rhetorician Susan Foss also ex- tends the scope of rhetorical expression to include non-combative per- suasion (persuasion that does not intend to change the position of the - audience, but to gain acceptance for the position of the speaker). i Ulhy This Approach? Games offer a unique format in which the playedaudience has some opportunity to control and configure their experience. Interactive game players thrive on a sense of agency-a desire to see the results of their interactions. This desire is amplified in online games, which offer players the opportunity to communicate with a wide audience. Rre you getting it yet? OH, NOW TO THOSE SGCRETS. Secret number one.. .oh, shit.
