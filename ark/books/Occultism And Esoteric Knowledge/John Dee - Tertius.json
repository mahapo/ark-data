And commyng to the stone, E.T. saw there those two, whom hitherto, we wer instructed to be Michael and Uriel. E.T: Michael and Uriel, both kneled holding up theyr hands: and Michael seamed to sweat water abundantly, somwhat reddish or bluddish. There cam 7 Bundells down, (like faggots) from heven ward. And Michael taketh them kneeling. And Uriel taketh a thing like a superaltare and layeth it uppon the Table: and with a thing like a senser doth make perfume at the fowre corners of the Table: the smoke ascending up: and the senser, at the last, being set on the Table it seemed to fall throwgh the Table.

From under the Table commeth a great smoke, and the place semeth to shake. Uriel lieth now prostrate on his face: and Michael contynually prayed sweating.

The glorious man seemed to stand uppon a little hill of flaming fyre. He taketh of, of one of the Bundells a thing lyke a little byrd; and it hoovereth affore him as thowgh it had life: and than it rested uppon the thing like a superaltare.

He hath a berd forked of brownish cullour, his heare of his hed, long, hanging down to his sholders: but his face, for beutifull glittring, can not be discerned. His heares do shake, as thowgh the wynde carryed them. This man blesseth the bird, making a Cross over it: and so he did three tymes. He looketh up to heven. Now the byrd, which, before, seamed to be but as byg as a sparrow, seameth to be as great as a swanne: very beutifull: but of many cullours.

And this they did very often: and in diverse places of the heven with great celeritie. After this they semed to fly over Cities, and townes, and to break the clowdes in peces, as they passed: and to cause all dust to flye from all walls, and towres, as they passed, and so to make them clene. And in the streetes, as these two Byrds flew, seemed diverse brave fellows, like bisshops, and Princis and Kings, to pass: and by the wyngs of these byrds, they were striken down.
