They weave a complex and long-lasting spell, creating all these subethric ltnots which can redefine the reality around the machine. Since these Imots try to unravel themselves, the magickal engine has to hold them together, which it does by contin- uing to run. It keeps the tension off the knots so they won’t untie, if you want to think of it that way So what they do is gather up large quanti- ties of energy, larger quantities than the sponta- neous engines do, and use them to alter the qualities of the world immediately around them. The reason they need to usc so much energy is that the spells must be able to last for a lot longer. The curious thing is that the engine itself is what does the work, not the magickal power. The engine uses thc magicli as a catalyst, but when it is shut off, it releases the magicltd ener- gy back into its surroundings. This means that when a continuous sorcerous automata starts up, it gathers up a bunch of power, depleting the area. When it’s shut off, the power returns pret- ty rapidly. However, if you moire the magiclcal engine, the power it has accumulated goes with it, held by its mechanical arms. If it’s shut down somewhere else, that place will have more power than normal. We haven’t done much experimenting on what happens when a place has more than a nor- mal amount of magickal energy. Mer all, we’ve only had these aerodreadnoughts a short while, and we’re keeping the few other engines we’ve built securely under guard back at Falkenstein. So what happens when an area is ovcrstoclted on magick? It could be that anyone casicing a spell in the area gathers more power than intended. You could simulate this in the game, if you like.

Perhaps the wiz- ard has the option of discarding these extra cards forced upon him or her, or perhaps not. Not is definitely more fun., and I think it’s more realistic. Casting a spell in an area supersaturat- ed with magick would seem to be as risky as lighting a torch in a fireworks warehouse. Especially if there’s another joker or two in the extra cards. You could take a simi- lar approach when some- one fires up a magickal engine in an area where there’s a lot of magickal power. You can imagine that as magickal engines become more common, whatever wizards are in the area are going to get peeved.

This is due to the effects I described above. However, there are spontaneous magickal engines which require more power than a mage would to do the same thing with a spell. For example, the transformation engine takes 16 points of power to acti- vate, while a Templar can change the shape of an item with a 12-point spell.

This means the dramatic characters have to gain access to the knowledge of how to build mag- ickal engines through their own activities.

You can obtain copies of the plans fi-om my copy of Leo’s Codex, or discover a long- lost page of Leo’s original notebooks in some widow’s attic in Genoa, or acquire the plans from someone else who, by hook, crook, or genius, has a copy of his own. Or, hardest of all, you can design your own magiclial engine (don’t even try untd you’re Excellent at Sorcerous Engineering). Getting the plans must be played through in the game. We of the Inner Circle are loathe to give up our secrets, as would be anyone else the Host decides has a plan for a magickal engine. Unless the dramatic characters have ingratiated themselves to no end with the leaders of Bayern, they’ll have to come up with a darned interesting scheme to get hold of the plans. flEW SKJLL: SORCERO~S ENGJNEERJflG (e) his is the ability to design and tune sorcer- ous automata (building them in and of itself is a Tinkering feat). A Poor Sorcerous Engineering skill means you are technically illit- erate with magiclial engines; you don’t know how to operate them, and if you tried to design or tune one, others nearby would run for very solid cover from the impending blast. Good Sorcerous Engineering is still not particularly good; you can probably adjust very simple devices, but your designs are only the most basic, and are still unreliable at best. Tuning complex magickal engines is still a nervous undertaking. Great Sorcerous Engineering ability allows you to readily design very simple engines, and even undertake some more com- plex ones. Tuning engines is something which you perform with confidence. Those with Exceptional Sorcerous Engineering skills can design a wide variety of engines, and tune them quickly and efficiently. Characters with an Extraordinary ability at Sorcerous Engineering can create any magickal engine imaginable, and tune even the most temperamental and explo- sive engine without a fuss. Those with such skills are on par with Leo himself, and are prob- ably bent on global domination besides. Designing an engine from scratch involves a Sorcerous Engineering feat. Use the complexi- ty of the engine as the difficulty of designing it, i.e., the harder it is to build, the harder it is to design as well, right? If the engine being devel- oped is a new one, use our complexities as guidelines. If it’s a combination of engines given in this book, you might want to take the higher difficulty and add half the lower to determine how tough a feat it is.

This gate is paired to another gate at the engine by an ethereal tunnel which transcends normal space. This gate allows people at the engine to look through the gate and see what’s on the other side as if they were there. This means that people on opposite sides of the engine will be loolung in different directions of the target area, and will see opposite walls of the place the far gate is placed. This gate allows only for the transmission of light, yet it does not diminish the light present at the location being spied upon.

Evasions and half- truths can result in a slight decrease in the diff- culty. Obviously, then, a large and powerful engine will be nigh irresistible in its sodium pen- tatholic effect. Jokers make everyone speak the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, no matter what, and no matter how trivial or pithy the remark. “Gee, that’s a terrible coat you have.

Like maybe it engenders a molecular-level steam explosion like the one that took St. Helens apart up in Washington in 1980. The amount of damage the shot causes is equal to the amount of energy used in the cre- ation of the fireball. It is possible to build this engine with a higher or lower activation level, and in fact, it’s recommended that smaller engines have very small activation levels.

It does not glow of itself; it causes all itcms within its radius of effect to be illumi- nated, in essence to reflect a magickal light. The light has no source, so there are no shadows within its area of effect. The magick causes items outside its radius to be lit as well, simply because there is some reflected light from items within the engine’s radius. However, this reflected light is scant at best. By the way, you’ll notice that this is a hearts spell; it’s psychic magick. I think this is because the engine doesn’t actually cause real light, just the illusion of it.

Normal iron is what the Prussians are beat- ing into sabers and bayo- nets and land fortresses even as we speak. Normal iron has some negative effects on magick, too. The iron railways the Prussians and English Steam Lords are building are hampering the normal flow of magicli about the land.

And Star Iron has a great effect upon magicli, far more so than normal iron. To hear Auberon explain it, Star Iron is a lot like plutonium to the Faerie. Yeesh. Star Iron’s effect is so pronounced that the Faerie can actually die just by being too close to it-they don’t even have to touch the stuff! And we’re talking the True Death here! No one knows why Star Iron has these effects. Grey Morrolan believes that is it because other planets out there do not have magick. That may or may not be, but it’s almost certain that there is no magick in deep space. Since the iron here has been exposed to the Earth’s magick for thou- sands of years, its suppressive effect on magick has been reduced over time. It’s been denatured. But Star Iron, Morrolan thinks, has never been exposed to a magickal field, and so has a very seri- ous effect on magick. Over a few hundred thou- sand years or so, he thinks Star Iron will be indw tinguishable from normal iron. This sounds pret- ty reasonable to me; I mean, the planet is sup- Dosed to have been made by a whole bunch of iron-nickel asteroids mushing together, right? So, in theory, all the iron on the planet is Star Iron if you go back far enough. And since it doesn’t act that way, that indicates that maybe Star Iron can be denatured by chronic exposure to magickal energies. Whatever the case, Star Iron is needed, so Star Iron the characters must get. As you might figure, you just can’t go trot on down to Fred’s Convenience Store on the corner and pick up half a pound of Star Iron.
