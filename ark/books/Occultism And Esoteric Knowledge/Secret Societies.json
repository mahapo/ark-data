(In India, Brahma is the name of the rising sun, he is symbolized by the boar and the bull, the phallus is one of his chief emblems, along with the lion and the peacock, and the word Brahma means \"Father.\" Vishnu bears the titles \"destroyer,\" \"lord of serpents,\" and \"thunderbolt.\" He is represented by goat, a 7-headed serpent, the phallus, a hog, a man-headed Fish-- Dagon, the sun-god in the ocean--and by a lion. Though primarily the setting sun, Vishnu, like other sun-gods and their earthly vicars, was said to rule over heaven, earth, and hell, to have a triple crown. From every angle, Shiva or Siva represents not only the sun-god but also Lucifer. He is represented by a lion, by a serpent, by a bull, by the peacock--symbol of the devil throughout the East--and by the phallus. Shiva also wears the triple crown and bears the title “Lord of the three worlds.\" Called \"the god of a thousand names, \"his multitude of demon titles as well as the manner in which he is worshiped show clearly that he is none other than \"that old serpent, the devil.\" He regularly bears the pitchfork as his staff of office.) The God or Gods of Masonry: Abraxas, Adad, Adonis,** Amun, Baal, Bel, Hu, the Sun, and a host of others are listed by Mackey ( Ency. of Freemasonry ) as a \"name of the true God,\" identified with Jehovah, or as a deity worshiped in the mysteries of which Masonry everywhere declares he is the successor. Abraxas is identified with Christ on p.9 of the 1917 edition of this work, and with Satan on p. 117 of History of Freemasonry and Concordat Orders , Stillson, who was assisted in his editorial work by a board of 81 leading Masons. The Gnostics worshiped Abraxas under the symbol of a lion-headed serpent and connected the number 666 with him. Adad, who is declared to represent God among the upper degrees of Masonry (Mackey, op. cit ., p. 16), Adad the stormy man-bull god of Syria, is called \"destroyer, \"t he Roaring One,\" and \"wielder of the bolt\" in Syrian texts. A Babylonian text tells how a Babylonian king kissed the feet of \"Adad, my lord.\"-- Royal Descriptions , Barton, p. 339. The mysteries of Adonis are frankly admitted to be the most closely related to Masonry of all the ancient mysteries.--Mackey, op. cit., pp. 25-29. Yet Adonis is identified with Tammuz, Bacchus, Osiris, Atys, Dis, Serapis, and other demon gods by scholars who have investigated the field. Phallic worship was especially associated with this cult, and the goat was one of the chief symbols for the god. Amun, Amen, or Ammon was represented by a bull, by a serpent, and by a lion. The name Amen means \"the Hidden One,\" and such titles as \"Lord of the Two Horns,\" \"Lord of Hades,\" show his demon connections. The phallus was one of his chief symbols, being representative of his title \"G od of the uplifted arm.\" In his hieroglyphic dictionary, Budge defines Amen as \"Hidden one, devil, secret, mysterious.\" _________________ **\"The mysteries of Adonis are said to have been first established at Babylon.... Adonis, which derived from the Heb. Adon,--lord or master--was one of the titles given to the sun.\"--Mackey, Adonis The word Baal means lord or master. Among the later Babylonian, Phoenician, and Caananite Cults, Baal became a proper name for the sun-god. Scholars consider that Baal is but a later spelling for Bel, the earlier Babylonian name for the sun. \"Baalim, in the plural, were the sun, moon, and stars, 'the host of heaven.'\" \"Baal peor, the lord of priapism ((phallic worship)), was the sun represented as the generative principle of nature, and identical with the phallus of other religions. Baal-gad was the lord of the multitude, (of stars); that is, the sun as the chief of the heavenly host-Mackey, op. cit., art. Baal. 2"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"\"Bel...has, with Jah and On, been introduced into the Royal Arch system as a representative of the Tetragrammeton....\"-- id ., art. Bel . (The word Tetragrammeton, usually spelled -maton , is the Babylonian-Jewish name for the four letters JHVH, which with the vowel points is Jehovah .)Another title of Bel in Babylon was Enlil , \"lord of de- mons,\" (see Web. Un .). Jah is considered to be a shortened form of Jehovah, and On was the name or one of the names-of the sun in Hebrew and Egyptian--Funk and Wagnall’s New Standard Dictionary. Hu, the Druidic name for the sun-god, is related to the word Jehovah according to Mackey. (See under Hu and Hi-Ho , the latter, according to this author being he-she and showing that God is both male and female!) Hu is called \"the Dragon Ruler of the World,\" \"the Smiter,\" \"the Strangler.\" He was represented both as a bull and as a serpent. His solar chariot is shown being pulled by serpents, and his priests were called \"adders.\" One of his titles was \"Father.\" \"Sun worship ... is modified and Christi anized in our modern system. Many, indeed nearly all of the Masonic symbols of the present day can only be thoroughly comprehended and properly appreciated by this reference to sun-worship.\"-- Symbolism of Freemasonry , Mackey, revised by Clegg, 33°, p. 28. Throughout the mysteries and everywhere in church art, the Hebrew equivalent for the letters JHVH, Jehovah, will be found written in the sun . At every step of the investigation of pagan gods and their concealed representations in the apostasy, one finds an attempt to identify God with Satan, the Saviour with the Serpent, and to combine the worship of Lucifer with the worship of Jehovah. It seems highly significant in this study that the Hebrew-Chaldee name of the sungod is Shamash , a word which in the letter-number system of the Babylonian H ebrews has as the numerical value of 640, as any Hebrew scholar will point out. Everywher e in the mysteries it is pointed out that the numerical value of JHVH in the Hebrew is 26. Busenbaak points out that by writing the JHVH in the sun , the mystics have a subtle way of concealing 666, \"the grand number of the sun,\" for this is the sum of 640 and 26.-- Symbols, Sex, and the Stars , p. 260. (This same fact is pointed out by Rev. Walter Begley in his Biblia Cabalistica , p. 120.) The Religion of Masonry : One frequently hears the statement made that Masonry is a social organization, not a religion. This statement is at variance with the facts: \"Masonry, then, is indeed, a religious institution.\"-- Ency. of Freemasonry , Mackey, art. Religion of Freemasonry . Religion is listed by Pierson as one of the subjects taught by Masonry. Traditions of Freemasonry, p. 120. \"...The Master is really the priest of the lodge.\"--Mackey, op. cit ., art. Priest . Other priest titles listed in this same work as applying to Masonic officers are High Priest, Grand High Priest, Royal Priest, and Priest Theosophist. The whole structure of the mysteries is built around a secret worship! \"Each of the pagan gods had (besides the public and open ceremonies) a secret worship paid unto him to which none were admitted but those who had been selected by preparatory ceremonies, called Initiation. This secret worship was termed the Mysteries.\" -- Symbolism of Freemasonry , Mackey, rev. by Clegg, p. 93. Foundation doctrines of the mysteries : \"It was, then, the great object of all the rites and mysteries of antiquity to teach the consoling doctrine of the immortality of the soul.\" \"The hidden doctrines of the unity of the Deity and the immortality of the soul were originally in all the Mysteries, even those of Cupid and Bacchus.\"-- id ., p. 231.

(The unity of the Deity\" mentioned above w ill be found, on close examination, to be based on the Gnostic principle that all the deities of the pagan and Christian world in reality are but forms of the one supreme god, Pan or Cosmos; centering in the sun as the central deity from whom all the other stellar gods as well as all matter, including man, are supposed to have emanated. In all these myst ic religions, the life of man is a \"divine spark\" which has descended from the solar deity and which ascends to it at death.) In every case, the astrological religion of Babylon is found to be the foundation of the mysteries! If some zealous vivisectionist were to attempt to cut away from the body of an animal as much, in proportion, as the science of astronomy enters into the mysteries of Free Masonry, either ancient or modern, he would scarcely leave more than the tips of the ears and the tail. The same may with equal truth be said of all the ancient religious mysteries.\"--Ancient Free Masonry, Higgins, 330, p. 177. \"Freemasonry is based on Sabeism, the worship of the stars.\" Freemasonry , Fellows, cited.

The work itself, though not by a Masonic writer, was accepted and published by a Masonic publishing house.) Much is made in Masonry over the legend of a mythical \"Hiram Abif.\" Note the symbolism involved: \"We are indebted to the Tyrian Freemasons for the introduction of the symbol of Hiram Abif. The idea of the symbol ... was evidently borrowed from the pagan mysteries, where Bacchus, Adonis, Proserpine, and a host of other apotheosized being play the same role that Hiram does in the Masonic Mysteries.-Mackey-Clegg, op. cit ., p. 20, 21. \"Take, for instance, the legend of the third degree, or the myth of Hiram Abif.... Its invention... was... intended to illustrate a philosophical or religious truth, which truth, it is hardly necessary for us to say, is the doctrine of the immortality of the soul.\"-- id ., pp. 209,209. Hiram is a \"symbol of the sun shorn if its vivifying rays and fructifying power by the three winter months, and its re storation to generative heat by the season of spring.\"-- id ., p. 238. The word Free in Free-Masonry is derived from Phre or Phra, the sun. -- Egyptian Belief and Modern Thought , Gonwick. On the eastern wall of nearly every Masonic hall is the letter G in a sun . Its meaning? \"The letter G represents Geometry and God.... Its deeper meaning is properly reserved for the more advanced degrees.\"-- Traditions of Freemasonry , Pierson, p. 137. ((One wonders what deeper meaning anything could have than God!)) The G in the flaming star represents Geomatria, God, G nosis, Generation, Goblin, Gravitation, and the 7 ranks or stations.-- Le Symbolique Maconnique , Babuf, pp. 237-239. It also represents the father as the generator and has the same significance as the Hebrew Jod, Yod, Iod. id ., p. 239. We turn to The Quabbalah Unveiled by McGregor-Mathers to learn what this significance is, to discover that it represents the lingam or membrum Virile in union with the orificii membri from which springs life. The old Hindu form of the Yod is a straight line in contact with a circle--and several other alphabets have the same form--an echo of which is still to be found in the dot over our own letter i or Yod. (McGregor-Mathers was the Rosicrucian teacher of A.E. Crawley, the \"secret master\" who gave the charter to the San Jose Rosicrucians.) Everywhere in the mysteries, an upright bar or vertical mark is considered as symbolic of the \"serpent which standeth erect,\" the activated phallus.-- The Rosicrucians, Their Rites and Ceremonies , Jennings. Still another secret society writer informs us that the G refers to the \"Garden of Venus,\" which has a \"narrow pathway\" by which one may ascend and descend, the whole being an allegory dealing with the \"mystery of Generation.\"-- Freemasonry , A.E. Waite, vol.l. The same writer goes on, \"He who understands the secret of the sexes has the key of all things.... Physical generation ... is symbolized by a Garden of Venus.\" It appears certain, therefore, that the \"deeper meaning\" of this mystic letter G has the same significance as the yoni-lingam symbol to be found outside every Hindu temple and that we have here the same sex worship to be found in the rawest of the pagan mysteries. This conclusion is to be further borne out by a multitude of other symbols used in the secret societies. One of the most frequently used such symbols is a dot within a circle, the Egyptian symbol for Ra the sun-god, called in the Egyptian texts the \"Generator\" and \"the Heavenly Bull.\" (We note that the symbolism here is identical with the Masonic G in the circle of the sun). \"Properly to understand this symbol ((the dot within the circle))\" we read, \"we must refer... to the worship of the Phallus, a peculiar modification of sun-worship, which prevailed to a great extent among the nations of antiquity.\"- Mackey-Clegg, op. cit ., p. 111. In India, the same Sanscrit word is defined as \"The architect of the gods, creator, penis, Father, Siva.\" -- The Practical Sanskrit-English Dictionary , Apte, p. 642. It would appear that it is the knowledge of such secret signs 5"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"and symbols as these which enables a high degree Mason to enter the intersanctum of a Hindu temple by giving the proper hand signs at the door. -- Freemasonry and the Ancient Gods , Ward, p. 13. A multitude of other Masonic symbols could be sighted which have the same phallic meaning, but we will omit them with but a mention of the so-called \"Seal of Solomon\" or \"Whield of David,\" the doubletriangle which is found in the mysteries throughout the world. This symbol, we read, represents God when it has the significant dot in the center.--Ward, op.cit ., p. 12. We have been told, as noted earlier, that we must turn to India if we are to learn the full meaning of Masonic symbols. In India, the downward pointing triangle, frequently made in black, represents woman, sin, darkness, and the underworld. The upward pointing triangle represents man, goodness, light, and the realm of light and life. Thus the two in union symbolize exactly the same thing as the tessellate black and white floor of the Masonic lodge, and it is significant that this same sacred seal of the mysteries is sometimes used to replace the phallic organs on Hindu bi-sexual gods.-- Symbols, Sex, and the Stars , Busenbark, p. 157. The upward point triangle is also the symbol of the male god of Hades Siva while the one pointing down represents the female goddess of Hades, Vishnu.-- id . This same writer also informs us that the serpent frequently placed across the two triangles in union is the Oriental symbol for lust. We noted in an earlier study that the secret societies also use the \"seal\" with its central circle or dot as a symbol of the 7 planets, being pictured with the symbols of the planets at the tips of the \"star.\" Everywhere in the mysteries, just as in the religious art of ancient paganism, one finds the serpent. It is a much used symbol in Freemasonry representing, we are told, both Good and Evil, God and Satan.-- Ency. of Freemasonry , Mackey, art. Serpent . The serpent, we are told by Parker, \"entered into the mythology of every nation, consecrated almost every temple, symboliz ed almost every deity, was imagined in the heavens, stamped on the earth, and ruled in the realms of eternal sorrow .... The close relationship if not absolute identity among the early races of man between Solar, Phallic, and serpent worship was most striking; so marked indeed as to indicate that they are all forms of a single worship.\"-- The Evil Eye , p. 51. Paul points out the true nature of this single worship in 1 Cor. 10:20. And we find numerous hints as to its nature in the writings of the secret societies: \"Sons of Light. Freemasons are so called because Lux, or Light, is one of the leading characteristics of Speculative Freemasonry. --Mackey-Clegg, op.cit ., p. 361. \"Light... was revered because it was an emanation of the sun, the common object of worship.\"-- id ., p. 348. \"Sabianism, the worship of light, prevailed amongst all the leading nations of the early world.\"-- id ., p. 27. \"Thus it will be perceived that the religious sentiment of a good and an evil principle gave to darkness, in the ancients ... has supplied Freemasonry with a double Symbolism--that of Light and Darkness . Darkness is the symbol of initiation.\"-- id . p. 155. The word Lucifer is derived from Lux -feros , \"Light-bearer.\" Lucifer, we are told by Waite, represents light-darkness, malefemale, and is related to the tiled floor (with alternating black and white squares) of the Universal Lodge.-- Freemasonry , vol.1. Pike tells us that everything has emanated from \"the Ancient King of Light.\"-- Morals and Dogma , p.286. This king of Light in the pagan mysteries is of course the sun, Enlil, the lord of demons, the god whom the ancients pictured as a being with hoofs, horns, a tail, and a pitchfork. \"A ray of light, shot from the Deity, is the cause and principle of all that 6"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"exists. It is at once Father and Mother of All, in the sublimest sense.\" \"Lucifer, the Light- bearer! Strange and mysterious name to give the Spirit of Darkness. Lucifer, the Son of the Morning! Is it he who bears the Light, and with its splendors intolerable blinds feeble, sensual, or selfish Souls? Doubt it not! for traditions are full of Divine Revelations and Inspirations: and Inspiration is not of one Age nor of one Creed. Plato and Philo, also, were inspired.\"-- id ., pp. 267, 321. (Pike's work is an authorized Masonic publication.) If these things be true, why do not the multitude of fine Christian people who belong to Masonic organizations know about them? The answer is given by the publications themselves: \"Masonry, like all the Religions, all the Mysteries, Hermeticism and alchemy, conceals its secrets from all except the Adepts and Sages, or the Elect, and uses false explanations and misinterpretations of its symbols to mislead those who deserve only to be misled: to conceal the Truth which it calls Light, from them, and to draw them away from it.\" id ., p. 104. \"To pretend to explain the sy mbols while leaving them still an enigma has ever been the rule in the mysteries. They had an outer explanation for the profane and unwise initiates, and, an Inner for the Adepts.\"-- Of Masonic Symbolism , Pike, p. 58. \"One of the most beautiful; but at the same time most abstruce, doctrines of the science of Masonic symbolism is that the Freemason is ever to be in search of truth, but is never to find it.\"-Mackey-Clegg, op. cit ., p. 228. Miscellaneous Notes : \"All the secrets of Masonry are concealed in the Hebrew or Chaldee language.\"-- The Rosicrucians , Jennings, p.90. \"It has been thought by some writers that during the captivity in Babylonia, the Jews inbibed the notions of the Orient on all religious and mysterious subjects....\" id., p. 93.

The Palladists see in Satan the true Adonai, the element of Goodness. The Luciferians worship the God of Evil. \"In both cases, it will be seen, there is faith in the Devil.\"-- id ., p. 336.
