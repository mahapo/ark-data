The First Pentacle of Saturn . – This Pentacle is of great value and utility for striking terror into the Spirits. Wherefore, upon its being shown to them they submit, and kneeling upon the earth before it, they obey. Editor’s Note. – The Hebrew Letters within the square are the four great Names of God which are written with four letters: – YHVH, Yod, He, Vau, He; ADNI, Adonai; IIAI, Yiai (this Name has the same Numerical value in Hebrew as the Name EL); and AHIH, Eheieh. The Hebrew versicle which surrounds it is from Psalm lxxii 9; \"The Ethiopians shall kneel before Him, His enemies shall lick the dust.\" Figure 12. The Second Pentacle of Saturn . – This Pentacle is of great value against adversaries; and of especial use in repressing the pride of the Spirits. Editor’s Note . – This is the celebrated S A T O R A R E P O T E N E T O P E R A R O T A S, the most perfect existing form of double acrostic, as far as the arrangement of the letters is concerned; it is repeatedly mentioned in the records of medieval Magic; and, save to very few, its derivation from the present Pentacle has been unknown. It will be seen at a glance that it is a square of five, giving twenty-five letters, which, added to the unity, gives twenty-Six, the numerical value of IHVH. The Hebrew versicle sur- rounding it is taken from Psalm lxxii 8, \"His dominion shall be also from the one sea to the other, and from the flood unto the world’s end. This passage consists also of exactly twenty-five letters, and its total numerical value (considering final letters with increased numbers), added to that of the Name Elohim , is exactly equal to the total numerical value of the twenty-five letters in the Square. Figures 11 and 12."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"The Holy Pentacles Page 61 Figure 13. The Third Pentacle of Saturn . – This should be made within the Magical Circle, and it is good for use at night when thou invokest the Spirits of the nature of Saturn. Editor’s Note. – The characters at the ends of the rays of the Mystic Wheel are Magical Characters of Saturn. Surrounding it are the Names of the Angels: Omeliel, Anachiel, Arauchiah, and Anazachia, written in Hebrew. Figure 14. The Fourth Pentacle of Saturn . – This Pentacle serveth principally for executing all the experiments and operations of ruin, destruction, and death. And when it is made in full perfection, it serveth also for those Spirits which bring news, when thou invokest them from the side of the South. Editor’s Note. – The Hebrew words around the sides of the triangle are from Deut. vi.4: – \"Hear, O Israel, IHVH ALHINVH is IHVH ACHD.\" The surrounding versicle is from Psalm cix. 18: – \"As he clothed himself with cursing like as with a garment, so let it come unto his bowels like water, and like oil into his bones.\" In the center of the Pentacle is the mystic letter Yod. Figure 15. The Fifth Pentacle of Saturn . – This Pentacle defendeth those who invoke the Spirits of Saturn during the night; and chaseth away the Spirits which guard treasures. Editor’s Note. – The Hebrew letters in the angles of the Cross are those of the Name IHVH. Those in the Angles of the Square form ALVH, Eloah. Round the four sides of the Square are the Names of the Angels: – Arehanah, Rakhaniel, Roelhaiphar, and Noaphiel. The versicle is: \"A Great God, a Mighty, and a Terrible.\" – Deut x. 17.

The person against whom thou shalt pronounce it shall be obsessed by Demons. Editor’s Note. – It is formed from Mystical Characters of Saturn. Around it is writ- ten in Hebrew: \"Set thou a wicked one to be ruler over him, and let Satan stand at his right hand.\" Figure 17. The Seventh and Last Pentacle of Saturn . – This Pentacle is fit for exciting earthquakes, seeing that the power of each order of Angels herein invoked is sufficient to make the whole Universe tremble.

Figure 18. The First Pentacle of Jupiter . – This serveth to invoke the Spirits of Jupiter, and especially those whose Names are written around the Pentacle, among whom Parasiel is the Lord and Master of Treasures, and teacheth how to become pos- sessor of places wherein they are. Editor’s Note. – This Pentacle is composed of Mystical Characters of Jupiter. Around it are the Names of the Angels: – Netoniel, Devachiah, Tzedeqiah, and Parasiel, written in Hebrew. Figure 19. The Second Pentacle of Jupiter . – This is proper for acquiring glory, honors, dignities, riches, and all kinds of good, together with great tranquillity of mind; also to discover Treasures and chase away the Spirits who preside over them. It should be written upon Virgin Parchment, with the pen of the swallow and the blood of the screech-owl. Editor’s Note. – In the center of the Hexagram are the letters of the Name AHIH, Eheieh; in the upper and lower angles of the same, those of the Name AB, the Father; in the remaining angles those of the Name IHVH. I believe the letters outside the Hexagram in the reentering angles to be intended for those of the first two words of the Versicle, which is taken from Psalm cxii. 3: – \"Wealth and Riches are in his house, and his righteousness endureth for ever.\" Figure 20. The Third Pentacle of Jupiter . – This defendeth and protecteth those who invoke and cause the Spirits to come. When they appear show unto them this Pentacle and immediately they will obey. Editor’s Note. – In the upper left hand corner is the Magical Seal of Jupiter with the letters of the Name IHVH. In the others are the Seal of the Intelligence of Jupiter, Figures 18 and 19."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"The Holy Pentacles Page 65 and the Names Adonai and IHVH.

The Fourth Pentacle of Jupiter . – It serveth to acquire riches and honor, and to possess much wealth. Its Angel is Bariel. It should be engraved upon silver in the day and hour of Jupiter when he is in the Sign Cancer. Editor’s Note. – Above the Magical Sigil is the Name IH, Iah. Below it are the Names of the Angels Adoniel and Bariel, the letters of the latter being arranged about a square of four compartments. Around is the Versicle from Psalm cxii. 3: – \"Wealth and Riches are in his house, and his righteousness endureth for ever.\" Figure 22. The Fifth Pentacle of Jupiter . – This hath great power. It serveth for assured visions. Jacob being armed with this Pentacle beheld the ladder which reached unto heaven. Editor’s Note. – The Hebrew letters within the Pentacle are taken from the five last words of the versicle which surrounds it, each of which contains five letters. These are, then, recombined so as to form certain Mystical Names. The versicle is taken from Ezekiel i. 1: – \"As I was among the captives by the river of Chebar, the heavens were opened, and I saw visions of Elohim.\" In my opinion the versicle should only consist of the five last words thereof, when the anachronism of Jacob using a Pentacle with a sentence from Ezekiel will not longer exist. Figure 23. The Sixth Pentacle of Jupiter . – It serveth for protection against all earthly dangers, by regarding it each day devoutedly and repeating the versicle which surroundeth it. \"Thus shalt thou never perish.\" Figures 20 and 21."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"The Key of Solomon Page 66 Editor’s Note. – The four Names in the Arms of the Cross are:- Seraph, Kerub, Ariel, and Tharsis; the four rulers of the Elements. The versicle is from Psalm xxii 16, 17: – \"They pierced my hands and my feet, I may tell all my bones.\" Figure 24. The Seventh and last Pentacle of Jupiter . – It hath great power against poverty, if thou considerest it with devotion, repeating the versicle. It serveth furthermore to drive away those Spirits who guard treasures, and to discover the same. Editor’s Note. – Mystical Characters of Jupiter with the verse: – \"Lifting up the poor out of the mire, and raising the needy from the dunghill, that he may set him with princes, even with the princes of his people.\" – Psalm cxiii. 7.

The First Pentacle of Mars . – It is proper for invoking Spirits of the Nature of Mars, especially those which are written in the Pentacle. Editor’s Note. – Mystical Characters of Mars, and the Names of the four Angels: – Madimiel, Bartzachiah, Eschiel, and Ithuriel written in Hebrew around the Pentacle. Figure 26. The Second Pentacle of Mars . – This Pentacle serveth with great success against all kinds of diseases, if it be applied unto the afflicted part. Editor’s Note. – The letter Hé, in the angles of the Hexagram. Within the same the Names IHVH, IHShVH Yeheshuah (the mystic Hebrew Name for Joshua or Jesus, formed of the ordinary IHVH with the letter Sh placed therein as emblematical of the Spirit), and Elohim. Around it is the sentence, John i. 4: – \"In Him was life, and the life was the light of man.\" This may be adduced as an argument of the greater antiq- uity of the first few mystical verses of the Gospel of St. John. Figure 27. The Third Pentacle of Mars . – It is of great value for exciting war, wrath, discord, and hostility; also for resisting enemies, and striking terror into rebel- lious Spirits; the Names of God the All Powerful are therein expressly marked. Editor’s Note. – The Letters of the Names Eloah and Shaddai. In the Center is the great letter Vau, the signature of the Qabalistic Microprosopus. Around is the versicle from Psalm lxxvii 13. – \"Who is so great a God as our Elohim?\" Figure 28.

Round it is the versicle from Psalm cx. 5: – \"The Lord at thy right hand shall wound even Kings in the day of His Wrath.\" Figure 29. The Fifth Pentacle of Mars . – Write thou this Pentacle upon Vir- gin Parchment, because it is terrible unto the Demons, and at its sight and aspect they will obey thee, for they cannot resist its presence. Editor’s Note. – Around the figure of the Scorpion is the word HVL. The versicle is from Psalm xci. 13: – \"Thou shalt go upon the lion and added, the young lion and the dragon shalt thou tread under thy feet.\" Figure 30. The Sixth Pentacle of Mars . – It hath so great virtue that being armed therewith, if thou art attacked by any one, thou shalt neither be injured nor wounded when thou fightest with him, and his own weapons shall turn against him. Editor’s Note. – Around the eight points of the radii of the Pentacle are the words \"Elohim qeber, Elohim hath covered (or protected),\" written in the Secret Alphabet of Malachim, or the writing of the Angels. The versicle is from Psalm xxxvii. 15: – \"Their sword shall enter into their own heart, and their bow shall be broken.\" Figure 31.

The Letters in Hebrew, and in the Secret Alphabet called the Celestial, compose the Names of Spirits. Round the Pentacle is: – \"He gave them hail for rain, and flaming fire in their land. He smote their vines also, and their fig-trees.\" – Psalm cv. 32,33. Figures 29 and 30. Figure 31."},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"The Key of Solomon Page 70 THE SUN. Figure 32. The First Pentacle of the Sun . – The Countenance of Shaddai the Almighty, at whose aspect all creatures obey, and the Angelic Spirits do reverence on bended knees. Editor’s Note. – This singular Pentacle contains the head of the great Angel Meth- raton or Metatron, the vice-regent and representative of Shaddai, who is called the Prince of Countenances, and the right-hand masculine Cherub of the Ark, as Sandal- phon is the left and feminine. On either side is the Name \"El Shaddai.\" Around is written in Latin: – \"Behold His face and form by Whom all things were made, and Whom all creatures obey.\" Figure 33. The Second Pentacle of the Sun . – This Pentacle, and the preced- ing and following, belong to the nature of the Sun. They serve to repress the pride and arrogance of the Solar Spirits, which are altogether proud and arrogant by their nature. Editor’s Note. – Mystical characters of the Sun and the Names of the Angels: – Shemeshiel, Paimoniah, Rekhodiah, and Malkhiel. Figure 34. The Third Pentacle of the Sun . – This serveth in addition (to the effects of the two preceding) to acquire Kingdom and Empire, to inflict loss, and to acquire renown and glory, especially through the Name of God, Tetragrammaton, which therein is twelve times contained. Editor’s Note. – The Name IHVH, twelve times repeated; and a versicle somewhat similar to Daniel iv. 34: – \"My Kingdom is an everlasting Kingdom, and my dominion endureth from age to age.\" Figures 32 and 33."},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"The Holy Pentacles Page 71 Figure 35.

The Fifth Pentacle of the Sun. – It serveth to invoke those Spirits who can transport thee from one place unto another, over a long distance and in short time. Editor’s Note. – Characters in the \"Passing of the River\" Alphabet, forming Spirit’s Names. The Versicle is from Psalm xci. 11, 12: – \"He shall give His Angels charge over thee, to keep thee in all thy ways. They shall bear thee up in their hands.\" Figure 37. The Sixth Pentacle of the Sun . – It serveth excellently for the oper- ation of invisibility, when correctly made. Editor’s Note. – In the center is the Mystical letter Yod, in the Celestial Alphabet. The three letters in the \"Passing of the River\" writing, in the Angles of the triangle, form the great Name Shaddai. The words in the same characters round its three sides are, in my opinion, from Genesis i. 1: – \"In the beginning the Elohim created, etc.\"; but the characters are sadly mangled in the MSS. The versicle is from Psalms lxix. 23, and cxxxv. 16: – \"Let their eyes be darkened that they see not; and make their loins continually to shake.

The Second Pentacle of Venus . – These Pentacles are also proper for obtaining grace and honor, and for all things which belong unto Venus, and for accomplishing all thy desires herein. Editor’s Note. – The letters round and within the Pentacle form the Names of Spirits of Venus.
