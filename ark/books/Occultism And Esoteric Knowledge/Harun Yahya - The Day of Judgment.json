Y ou must use the opportunity given to you by Allah to obtain the reward, happiness, and peace awaiting you in the Hereafter, which cannot be compared to anything on Earth. The only thing that you have to do is to believe in Allah and the certainty of the Hereafter and be thankful for all the blessings that He gives to you. The contents of this book have been designed to help you extract yourself from your everyday occupation and desires for a while so that you can see the true purpose for your life. It seeks to inform you in advance about the Day of Judgment that you will most certainly encounter. This is an important warning, because everybody who ignores this Day and its aftermath will witness unbearable events on the Day of Judgment and experience endless hardship in the Hereafter. ABOUT THE AUTHOR The author, who writes under the pen-name Harun Yahya, was born in Ankara in 1956. He studied arts at Istanbul's Mimar Sinan University, and philosophy at Istanbul University. Since the 1980s, the author has published many books on political, faith-related and scientific issues. Greatly appreciated all around the world, these works have been instrumental in helping many to return their faith in Allah, and, in many others, to gain a deeper insight into their faith. Harun Yahya's books appeal to all kinds of readers, regardless of their age, race, or nationality, for they focus on one objective: to broaden the r eader's perspective by encouraging him or her to think about a number of critical issues, such as the existence of Allah and His unity, and to live by the values He prescribed for them."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"www.harunyahya.com Translated by Yasar Kutukcu Edited by Jay Willoughby All translations from the Qur'an are from The Noble Qur'an: a New Rendering of its Meaning in English by Hajj Abdalhaqq an Aisha Bewley, published by Bookwork, Norwich, UK. 1420 CE/1999 AH"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"THE DAY OF JUDGMENT HARUN YAHYA November, 2003"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"ABOUT THE AUTHOR Now writing under the pen-name of HARUN YAHYA, he was born in Ankara in 1956. Having completed his primary and secondary education in Ankara, he studied arts at Istanbul's Mimar Sinan University and philosophy at Istanbul University. Since the 1980s, he has published many books on political, scientific, and faith-related issues. Harun Yahya is well-known as the author of important works disclosing the imposture of evolutionists, their invalid claims, and the dark liaisons between Darwinism and such bloody ideologies as fascism and communism. His penname is a composite of the names Harun (Aaron) and Y ahya (John), in memo- ry of the two esteemed Prophets who fought against their people's lack of faith. The Prophet's seal on the his books' covers is symbolic and is linked to the their contents. It r epresents the Qur'an (the final scripture) and the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him), last of the prophets. Under the guidance of the Qur'an and the Sunnah (teachings of the Prophet), the author makes it his purpose to disprove each fundamental tenet of godless ideologies and to have the \"last word,\" so as to completely silence the objections raised against religion. He uses the seal of the final Prophet, who attained ultimate wis- dom and moral perfection, as a sign of his intention to offer the last word. All of Harun Yahya's works share one single goal: to convey the Qur' an's message, encourage readers to consider basic faith-related issues such as Allah's Existence and Unity and the Hereafter; and to expose godless systems' feeble foundations and pervert- ed ideologies. Harun Yahya enjoys a wide readership in many countries, from India to America, England to Indonesia, Poland to Bosnia, and Spain to Brazil. Some of his books are avail- able in English, French, German, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, Urdu, Arabic, Albanian, Russian, Serbo-Croat (Bosnian), Polish, Malay, Uygur Turkish, and Indonesian. Greatly appreciated all around the world, these works have been instrumental in many people recovering faith in Allah and gaining deeper insights into their faith. His books' wisdom and sincerity, together with a distinct style that's easy to understand, directly affect anyone who reads them. Those who seriously consider these books, can no longer advocate atheism or any other perverted ideology or materialistic philosophy, since these books are characterized by rapid effectiveness, definite results, and irrefuta- bility. Even if they continue to do so, it will be only a sentimental insistence, since these books refute such ideologies from their very foundations. All contemporary movements of denial are now ideologically defeated, thanks to the books written by Harun Yahya. This is no doubt a result of the Qur'an's wisdom and lucidity. The author modestly intends to serve as a means in humanity's search for Allah's right path. No material gain is sought in the publication of these works. Those who encourage others to read these books, to open their minds and hearts and guide them to become more devoted servants of Allah, render an invaluable service. Meanwhile, it would only be a waste of time and energy to propagate other books"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"that create confusion in people's minds, lead them into ideological chaos, and that clear- ly have no strong and precise effects in removing the doubts in people's hearts, as also verified from previous experience. It is impossible for books devised to emphasize the author's literary power rather than the noble goal of saving people from loss of faith, to have such a great effect. Those who doubt this can readily see that the sole aim of Harun Y ahya's books is to overcome disbelief and to disseminate the Qur'an's moral values. The success and impact of this service are manifested in the readers' conviction. One point should be kept in mind: The main reason for the continuing cruelty, con- flict, and other ordeals endured by the vast majority of people is the ideological preva- lence of disbelief. This can be ended only with the ideological defeat of disbelief and by conveying the wonders of creation and Qur'anic morality so that people can live by it. Considering the state of the world today, leading into a downward spiral of violence, corruption and conflict, clearly this service must be provided speedily and effectively, or it may be too late. In this effort, the books of Harun Yahya assume a leading role. By the will of Allah, these books will be a means through which people in the twentyfirst century will attain the peace, justice, and happiness promised in the Qur'an.

Since Darwinism rejects the fact of creation—and therefore, Allah's Existence—over the last 140 years it has caused many people to abandon their faith or fall into doubt. It is therefore an imperative service, a very impor- tant duty to show everyone that this theory is a deception. Since some readers may find the chance to read only one of our book, we think it appropriate to devote a chapter to summarize this subject. ✺ All the author's books explain faith-related issues in light of Qur'anic verses, and invite readers to learn Allah's words and to live by them. All the subjects concerning Allah's verses are explained so as to leave no doubt or room for questions in the r eader's mind. The books' sincere, plain, and fluent style ensure that everyone of every age and from every social group can easily understand them. Thanks to their effective, lucid narrative, they can be read at a one sitting. Even those who rig- orously reject spirituality are influenced by the facts these books document and cannot refute the truthfulness of their contents. ✺ This and all the other books by the author can be read individ- ually, or discussed in a group. Readers eager to profit from the books will find discussion very useful, letting them relate their r eflections and experiences to one another. ✺ In addition, it will be a great service to Islam to contribute to the publication and reading of these books, written solely for the pleasure of Allah. The author's books are all extremely con- vincing. For this reason, to communicate true religion to oth- ers, one of the most effective methods is encouraging them to r ead these books. ✺ We hope the reader will look through the reviews of his other books at the back of this book. His rich source material on faith- r elated issues is very useful, and a pleasure to read. ✺ In these books, unlike some other books, you will not find the author's personal views, explanations based on dubious sour- ces, styles that are unobservant of the respect and reverence due to sacred subjects, nor hopeless, pessimistic arguments that create doubts in the mind and deviations in the heart."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION ......................................................................10 THE DAY OF JUDGMENT IS APPROACHING ................13 THE EVENTS OF THAT DAY ..................................................19 ALLAH CREATED THE UNIVERSE ......................................49 AFTER THE UNIVERSE DIES ................................................77 TRUE LIFE BEGINS WITH DEATH ......................................107 CONCLUSION............................................................................127 THE DECEPTION OF EVOLUTION ......................................129 CONTENTS"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION And the Moon is eclipsed, and the Sun and the Moon are fused together, on that Day man will ask: \"Where can I run?\" No indeed!

You are working hard to get somewhere, trying to find your place in the struggle for a good life. You are very attentive to some matters and reflect deeply upon them. At the same time, you carefully avoid thinking about other matters and, as it happens, many people close to you do the same. Everyone knows what subjects to avoid in conversation and thought. Death is one of these, perhaps the most important one. For them, death is an end to which there is no solution. The Day of Judgment, which will bring \"death\" to the universe just like the death of people, is a matter that people do not like to think about; rather, they consider it as a remote and distant matter. They have a vague idea of what will happen on that Day, but since the thought of it scares them, people are inclined to forget about it. Rather than facing up to it, they just get on with their lives instead. People are most affected by the final day aspect of this Day for all beings, whether living or non-living.

To the contrary, the r eality of death and the events of that Day will lead people to do good in the cause of Allah, direct them to believe in the Hereafter, and bring them closer to Allah. Only the believers will be spared the great fear on that Day, on which previously unseen events will take place, for Allah reveals that they will have no cause for fear or sadness, for: Not so! All who submit themselves completely to Allah and are good-doers will find their reward with their Lord. They will feel no fear and know no sorrow. (Surat al-Baqara, 112) Those who believed in this Day and in the Qur'an, as well as that the real life is in the Hereafter, while alive and lived accordingly will be safe.

(Surat al-Hajj, 7) D eath is coming closer by the day. Whether you are young or old, death is a little closer to you every day, even every minute. You cannot resist time or prevent death's approach. Nothing you do can change the fact that you and those close to you are only \"temporary\" beings. Like every other living being, you are advancing toward the Day on which your life will end. Humanity is not the only part of creation that is subject to death. All other creatures, Earth itself and the whole universe, have a day of death fixed for them. The Day of Judgment is a day of terror and unimaginable fear. But at the same time, it is most wondrous. Everything on Earth will be flattened, the stars will be extinguished and fall in rapid succession, and the Sun will be wrapped up in darkness. All human beings who have ever lived will be gathered and made to witness this Day. This Final Day will be dreadful for the unbelievers, and its Lord will be Allah, Who owns all that exists.

Ambitions,"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"THE DAY OF JUDGMENT 14 desires, anger, expectations, lusts, enmities, and pleasures will cease. Plans made for the future will become meaningless, for those who had forgotten that they will be returned to Allah, preferring this world over the eternal life and its misleading wealth, beauty, and pleasures, will have met their end. On this Day, everyone will witness clearly Allah's existence and will come face to face with the death that they had tried so hard to forget. Their attempt to forget Allah and the Hereafter is finished, and a new beginning, one which will be eternal and bring no happiness to the unbelievers, is awaiting them. From the very first moment of this eternal life, the punishment is so fearsome that those who experience it will beg for \"death\" and \"annihilation.\" The beginning of this life is the Day of Judgment and, \"the Hour is coming without any doubt.\" LIFE ON EARTH IS TEMPORARY, AND DEATH IS A CERTAIN REALITY From your earliest childhood onwards, you head for certain goals or are guided by others. You probably will have a family and a job, try to earn more in order to have a better life, educate your children, and hope that they will have a better life than you did. Once a week you meet the other members of your extended family. Y ou take vacations, go to work, and spend the rest of your time at home. Except for a few hiccups on the way, your life progresses orderly and you usually encounter nothing outside the ordinary. Everything in your life seems to be premeditated, and everyone's life is like everyone else's. You need to work to realize these goals, and you need to have a family to continue your lineage. According to this worldview, what else could you possibly want besides \"a"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"good job\" and \"a nice family?\" Having achieved these goals, you expect to lead a happy life. In this way, everything is wonderful and you will live happily ever after. However, some important changes are happening in your body and environment. Many cells with diverse functions fulfill their purpose and die. As you age, it becomes harder to replace them. Y our body is ageing visibly, as seen through your illnesses and weaknesses. Time moves fast, and the impossibility of reversing it becomes clearer every day. Thinking that you were going to live happily and comfortably forever, you are nevertheless nearing death. Thus, this worldly life can never give the sense of contentment and peace you expect. When this \"satisfying\" life ends, you will come face to face with the real truth. Given this fact, none of your life ambitions should become your true purpose in life. This life is a temporary trial to separate the righteous from the evildoers. Allah reveals this reality in the following verse: He Who created death and life to test which of you is best in action. He is the Almighty, the Ever-Forgiving. (Surat al-Mulk, 2) The true purpose of life is not a decent job and a nice family. Rather, everybody has been created for one purpose: to serve Allah. We become attached to our children, rank, and status but with the first instance of death, these worldly pleasures lose their value and importance. Everybody knows this, but many choose to ignore it. And so such things should not be the ultimate goals of life. We must r eflect carefully and realize what is the real purpose and the true gain. Allah reveals the true purpose of our creation, as follows: I only created jinn and man to worship Me. (Surat adh- Dhariyat, 56) The Day of Judgment Is Approaching 15"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"THE DAY OF JUDGMENT 16 Only by fulfilling this responsibility can we expect the gifts of the Hereafter. Most people have some unfounded expectations and comfort themselves with them. But this is a great error. If one has nothing to expect from the Hereafter, there is only one possibility left: To become nothing with death, a possibility that is scarier than all the others. The unbelievers develop various methods of forgetting this possibility, because they fear it so much. Among these methods are not talking about, discussing, or remembering death, even though it is a certainty for everyone. Everybody acts as if it does not exist. That most people behave in such a way might be r eassuring to some extent, but in reality they are all misguided. People know about death, the Last Day, and the Hereafter, but r efuse to ponder them. They are satisfied with this worldly life, or at least make themselves believe that they are. However, Allah reveals that death will find everyone: Say: \"Death, from which you are fleeing, will certainly catch up with you. Then you will be returned to the Knower of the Unseen and the Visible, and He will inform you about what you did.\" (Surat al-Jumu‘a, 8) The universe and all of its contents, not just humanity, will die on the Day of Judgment, for on that Day the trial will end. Many people will recognize its coming by its signs, and the events leading up to the universe's death will be literally hair-raising. Finally, on that Day, Allah will raise up all those in the graves and all people on the Earth will be called to account. Those who did not expect to experience such a Day will no longer be able to deny it, and so will bow to Allah's will whether they want to or not. Allah has prepared a spectacular end for the universe, and despite most people's attempts to deny this reality, the Day of Judgment will come at its appointed time."},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"The Day of Judgment Is Approaching 17 THE DAY OF JUDGMENT IS A CERTAIN REALITY People who are satisfied with this world's temporary values and pleasures do their best to ignore such facts as their eventual death, which is just around the corner, and the Day of Resurrection. By not r eflecting upon such truths, they tell themselves that they can live only for themselves and forget about their duties to Allah. The Qur'an graphically depicts the events of the Last Day, and all of the people's accompanying shock, fear, panic, and mental framework. The universe will end in the same spectacular fashion in which it was created. Planets will fall out of their orbits, and mountains will be moved. In the face of such amazing events, those who put their faith in chance and random happenings will realize that only Allah rules over everything. Allah states: Say: \"To whom does everything in the heavens and Earth belong?\" Say: \"To Allah.\" He has made mercy incumbent upon Himself. He will gather you to the Day of Resurrection, about which there is no doubt. As for those who have lost their own selves, they have no faith. (Surat al-An‘am, 12) So when the Trumpet is blown with a single blast, and Earth and the mountains are lifted and crushed with a single blow, on that Day, the Occurrence will occur. (Surat al-Haqqa, 13-15) THE DAY OF JUDGMENT'S HOUR IS PREDETERMINED As time progresses, we are speedily approaching the Day of Judgment. Most people think that this Day is in the distant future. However, they would be well-advised to remember that previous generations had the same attitude.

As only Allah knows when the Day of Judgment will come, there is no guarantee that it will not happen while you are making plans for the future and are busying yourselves with your everyday lives, for: Say: \"I do not know whether what you are promised is close or whether my Lord will appoint a longer time before it.\" He is the Knower of the Unseen, and does not divulge His Unseen to anyone. (Surat al-Jinn, 25-26) The great order in which Allah created life will terminate at a time unknown to us. Those who doubt this fact and choose not to believe in it may consider themselves reasonable, and so this Day will be a hard and scary one for them. For this reason, it is far more beneficial and positive to believe in it, for it will be of no use to believe in it when the Hour has struck, or to feel remorse for their self-deception.

The unbelievers will suffer great fear, terror, and suffering, and all of their hidden remorse, fear, and debasement will be experienced. The Qur'an presents several allegories of this event. This chapter provides a general description of this Day's events and explores their meanings. Allah knows best, and only His knowledge is infinite. We, on the other hand, can understand and relate only what He has revealed and taught. Everything related in this chapter comes from the Qur'an, and therefore is beyond doubt. Given that only Allah knows how all of these events will occur, things might happen differently than we expect. We only know the following facts for certain: His promised events will take place, people on the Day of Judgment will come face to face with a spectacular scene unlike anything seen before, and that the universe and all of its contents will be completely destroyed. People will not have the opportunity to learn the reason for this, to escape and save themselves, or to strive for a solution. Everyone will realize that Allah and the Hereafter exist."},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"THE SOUND OF THE TRUMPET The Day Begins When the T rumpet Is Blown The Trumpet will be blown. That is the Day of the Threat. (Surah Qaf, 20) The sounding of the trumpet proclaims that the Day of Judgment, promised by Allah, has finally come, that this world has ended, and that the Hereafter has begun. Everyone has been informed of this great Day and what it holds, and has been warned that they would be brought to account. Now, they are face to face with this promised reality. This unexpected sound, which is unlike anything ever heard before, will cause people to realize that their time is up, for it indicates the beginning of infinite fear, terror, and hopelessness for the unbelievers—a very hard Day for them indeed. Allah says: For when the Trumpet is blown, that Day will be a difficult day, not easy for the unbelievers. (Surat al-Muddaththir, 8-10) Those who are fooled by the world order's temporary attractions and attach themselves tightly to such things are blind to the reality of Allah's existence and unity. They are supposedly happy and content with this illusion, and live without any consideration for the Creator of all or for His creation and its progress toward its end. In r eality, since Allah created this order, He will cause this spectacular system to cease to be, by giving a single command, in a mind- blowing fashion. Those who do not think that they will meet such a day will awake from their slumber immediately when the trumpet sounds. However, their new state will be of no benefit to them, for by this time it will be far too late to do anything for Allah and the Hereafter. THE DAY OF JUDGMENT 20"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"The Events of that Day 21 But why is it too late? Allah informs us that the reason behind this is that such people wasted their lives and ignored the trial and also the reality of the Hereafter. Such an attitude engenders a severe punishment, for its source is the individual's satisfaction with this limited world and ignoring the possibility of a past and future. People holding this attitude crave this life's temporary pleasures and disregard creation's purpose, and so spend their lives without wondering why they live, why they were created, what the Creator expects of them, and why they will die. They know about death, but are also aware that its reality raises questions that beg for answers. Therefore, they turn away and try to distance themselves from these thoughts as much as possible. In reality, however, the sole purpose for each person's creation and short life on Earth is to serve Allah. People who are aware of death's proximity, the shortness of this life, and that whatever happens to them is part of their trial, are also aware that they will meet with what the Qur'an reveals to them. Therefore, they understand that their sole purpose for being alive is to live for Allah. Realizing this while alive is a great benefit, for it causes people to distance themselves from the deceptive world and turn to their real home: the Hereafter. The greatest desire of those who chase after pleasure and lust is that this order will go on forever. But even that sometimes does not make them content, for life always contains problems and difficulties. Moreover, Satan has countless tactics to keep them from believing in the infinite sufferings of the Hereafter and has them prefer this life of hardship and sadness over faith. But when such people hear the trumpet sound, maybe while driving to work or while getting ready for bed, they will realize that all of their"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"postponed ambitions and expectations are for naught, and thus will fall into a state of utmost despair. The order that they had hoped would go on forever has ended, as have their own lives. Everything that they refused to believe in, despite knowing about them, now has caught up with them. Those people who lived in the shadow of false powers that were \"protecting them\" now have nowhere to seek re fuge, because all people except the believers are in the same hopeless situation. They have surrendered to the inevitable, and all people whoever lived are now assembled together in Allah's presence: The Trumpet will be blown, and at once they will be sliding from their graves toward their Lord. (Surah Ya Sin, 51) For the unbelievers, this event means \"meeting the very thing from which he or she ran away,\" as well as \"the end of the last opportunity to correct one's errors.\" The fear of that moment is indescribable, for such panic and terror has never been heard of or seen before. It might have been possible to make good mistakes or they might have been forgotten over time, but the trumpet's sound proclaims that no more time is left. On that Day, this sound will bring great fear to the unbelievers, and everybody will surrender to this reality.

Follow the best that has been sent down to you from your Lord before the punishment comes upon you suddenly, when you are not expecting it, lest anyone should say: \"Woe to me, for neglecting what Allah was due and for being one of the scoffers!\" or lest they should say: \"If only Allah had guided me, I would have been more heedful,\" or lest he should say, when he sees the punishment: \"If only I could have another chance so that I could be a good-doer!\" \"No, the fact is that My Signs came to you, but you denied them and were arrogant and were one of the unbelievers.\" On the Day of Resurrection you will see those who lied about Allah with their faces blackened.

(Surat az-Zilzal, 1-5) On the Day of Judgment, an ear-shattering sound will follow the sounding of the trumpet, and an unequalled tremor will rock Earth. Massive mountains, trees, skyscrapers, buildings—in fact every place on Earth—will begin to rock at the same time. People will panic and be gripped by great fear. The most fear-inspiring aspect is that no one can escape it or find any sort of refuge, for this tremor is not like the ones with which we are familiar; rather, this tremor will continue until Earth has been flattened. (Allah knows best.) Allah describes these tremors, as follows: On the Day the first blast shudders, and the second blast follows it, hearts that Day will be pounding and eyes will be cast down. (Surat an-Nazi‘at, 6-9) Tr y to imagine how much the tremors known to us affect those who experience them. These tremors lasted only for seconds, but the r esults were nevertheless devastating.

However, upon hearing the trumpet sound, even they will realize that this is no ordinary tremor and that there is no possibility of escape. The Qur'an warns of this event and of the tremors, as follows: Mankind, heed your Lord! The quaking of the Hour is a terrible thing. (Surat al-Hajj, 1) At that moment, nothing on Earth will have any meaning. Everything that led people astray (e.g., luxurious houses, gigantic skyscrapers, 5-star hotels, ambitiously accumulated life savings, houses, decorations, palaces, bridges, all of the most famous buildings, the Pyramids that have survived all natural disasters so far, historic castles, and whole cities) all will crumble like sand castles on the beach.

Earth Disgorges Its Charges And Earth then disgorges its charges, and man asks: \"What is wrong with it?\" on that Day it will impart all of its news, because your Lord has inspired it. (Surat az-Zilzal, 2-5) Earth's core, beginning at a depth of 5,000-6,000 kms (3,000-3,700 miles) from the surface, consists of highly pressurized magma that has an estimated temperature of 5,000 o C (9,000 o F). 1 The lava flows from volcanic eruptions come from areas close to the core. Throughout history, volcanic eruptions have caused terror, brought death to many people, and, in some cases, buried whole cities. Lava emerges from cracks in Earth's crust and, the higher the pressure, the higher it spurts into the sky. The main factor in this process is the presence of various gases that separate from the liquid substance on the way to the surface, for they form a layer above the magma and increase the pressure. The higher the proportion of gases, the greater the force of the resulting explosions. The boiling lava turns the area's surface into a quasi Hell. Such localized eruptions affect only a limited area. Researchers can anticipate such calamities and ensure that the necessary precautions are taken. The Qur'an says that \"Earth will disgorge its charges,\" indicating that, in addition to the many other things underground, the magma will spill over. The rocking tremors that are cracking the planet's crust on a global level, will prepare the ground for such a disaster.

Earth bows to Allah's will, for: When Earth is flattened out and disgorges what is inside it and empties out, hearkening to its Lord, as it is bound to do! (Surat al-Inshiqaq, 3-5) The Final Day has arrived, humanity's time is up, and everything has ended. No living thing can escape this day, for when it finally ends, there will be nothing left: no seed, plant, microorganism—not even Earth itself. Magma is not the only load that will be emptied out on that Day. Magma conducts heat and chemical reactions to the outer layer (the mantle) and between the mantle and the crust. Therefore, it probably will carry intense heat and many other subterranean substances to the surface, thereby increasing the surface temperature to previously unknown levels. Such events will cause Earth to spew forth all of its contents: minerals, coal, crude oil, fossils, corpses, ruins, and so on. Earth will be turned upside down, for: When the graves are emptied out, each self will know what it has sent ahead and left behind. (Surat al-Infitar, 4-5) Ground water will emerge from the cracks and, due to its highly pressurized nature, will cause damage in the vicinity and flood the entire planet.

The dust and smoke clouds blanketing every place, as well as the gases spreading out all at once, will suffocate people and cause great suffering. All of these events will make the unbelievers realize the scale of the eternal suffering awaiting them in Hell. Allah ends the lives of people with such a shocking spectacle, and for the unbelievers He has prepared an unspeakable spiritual and physical suffering.

(Surat at-Tur, 10) And the mountains are shifted and become a mirage.

Without a doubt, seeing all of them shaken from their places, pushed across Earth's face, and smashed up against one another, thereby flattening the whole planet, will be one of the most shocking scenes ever seen. We can hardly imagine such a scene. Imagine that the Himalayas, the Alps, and the Taurus mountains, which people consider unshakable and climbers struggle to ascend, all of a sudden were rocked and began to collapse and flatten themselves, as well as the surrounding towns. Building roadways through mountainous areas requires great technological means, machines, and tools. But even then, they are often used to no avail. Using dynamite to make a path is of little use, because it has only a local effect, or sometimes no effect at all. For this reason, many mountainous areas cannot be reached. On the Day of Judgment, all mountains will be pulverized. This is a very effective example of the destruction that will be wrought on that Day.

Say: \"My Lord will scatter them as dust. He will leave them as a barren, level plain on which you will see no dip or gradient.\" (Surah Ta Ha, 105- 107) The uneven ground we see today will be flat on that Day, for all people will be assembled on an endless plain: On the Day We make the mountains move, you see the earth laid bare, and We gather them together, not leaving out a single one of them.

No doubt, Allah can destroy and then level everything in a spectacular manner, for: That is Allah's promise. Allah does not break His promise. But most people do not know it. (Surat ar-Rum, 6) People who were proud of themselves will be worth nothing. Humanity, who considered itself great and powerful before Allah, who denied Him out of self-conceit, will be forlorn and weak amid these events. Everything that people considered greater than themselves will surrender on this Day, as decreed by Allah. Mountains, oceans, the whole universe—all will lose their rock- solid appearance and bow to Allah's will. Everything will be finished by Allah's command \"Be!,\" for they have obeyed Allah's order and fulfilled their roles as His submissive servants.

Even when forcing the limits of their minds, people can have only a vague idea of just how terrifying that event will be. So far, our personal experience probably consists of images of erupting volcanoes or burning crude oil tankers seen on television or in photographs. However, the descriptions given in the verses are beyond comparison. Only our knowledge of Allah's infinite greatness, power, and might can give an idea about the scale of these expected calamities, for He can alter or overturn the universe's order as part of the greater scheme of things. Along with everything else being spewed out of the ground, hot lava, having an estimated temperature of 5,000 o C (9,000 o F) will spill over wherever it can, including into the oceans. Those who have seen lava emerging from the bottom of the ocean in documentaries have witnessed something really amazing. The scenes on the Day of Judgment, however, will be very different, for they will be all- encompassing and far more terrifying. The oceans will burn, and an inescapable wall of fire will engulf people. On that Day, all oceans will be set alight. As Allah says in the Qur'an: When the seas are filled with flame. (Surat at-Takwir, 6) As a result of this, all aquatic life, as well as all terrestrial life, on Earth will cease. The oceans, usually soothing and cooling, suddenly will spread an incredible heat.

As Allah is the All-Mighty and the Creator of Earth and all of its contents, all He has to do is utter the command \"Be!,\" and whatever He wills occurs. The probable circumstances (only Allah knows the exact ones) leading up to these events serve to remind us of, and to be awed by, Allah as we draw closer to Him. Some of the probable events have to do with the rising of the oceans. As we know, earthquakes on the ocean floor cause tidal waves on the surface. The resulting tremors can send waves racing toward the shore at speeds of up to 750 kms (466 miles) per hour. Wa ves that start out as less than a meter (3 feet) high in the open sea can be 60 meters (200 feet) high by the time they reach the shore. A 25-35 meters (80 to 100 feet) high tidal wave created by a strong earthquake in Japan in 1896 swept over the town of Honshu, killing 25,000 people. Vo lcanic eruptions are another cause of tidal waves. The tidal wave created by the eruption of the volcano on Krakatoa in 1883 caused Krakatoa Island, located between Java and Sumatra, to submerge suddenly and unleash a tidal wave that hit one of the most densely populated stretches of Java's coastline. The wave, which destroyed 165 villages and killed 36,000 people, was more than 35 meters (110 feet) high when it reached the shore.

The pillars of this perfect equilibrium, all of which were created by Allah's will, will be destroyed at once again by His will. Also, it is quite probable that the underground heat will increase the atmospheric temperature, thus melting the ice at both poles and raising the water levels. We also know that landslides can cause unusually high waves on a lake or bay. On the Day of Judgment, not one mountain will be left standing, and Earth's surface will be leveled. Rocks rolling down the mountains will fill the ocean beds and cause floods. Once Allah's appointed time has come, such fear-inspiring events will unfold one after another: a deafening blast; the pulverizing of mountains; lava erupting from under people's feet; dust, gas, and smoke clouds suffocating Earth's surface; and scolding hot water overflowing onto people... a sudden remorse befalling those who did not contemplate Allah's existence or His might while alive... an overwhelming torment that subdues everyone indiscriminately, that exposes people's helplessness, the worthlessness of all that they valued while alive...

The sky, the Moon and the Sun, stars and planets, will all be destroyed, in accordance with what Allah has revealed: What you are promised will certainly happen. When the stars are extinguished, when Heaven is split open.

The Qur'an reveals these events, as follows: On the Day when Heaven sways to and fro. (Surat at-Tur, 9) The Heaven will be split apart therefrom; His promise will be fulfilled. (Surat al- Muzzammil, 18) And Heaven will be split apart, for that Day it will be very frail.

The atmosphere, so delicately sustained in a stable equilibrium by the laws of physics, will just melt and flow away. The end of the heavens is described, as follows: On the Day the sky is like molten brass.

The heavens and Earth, which responded to Allah's command of \"come willingly or unwillingly\" with \"we come willingly\" upon their creation, will again submit to their true owner and creator: Allah. The Qur'an r eveals Allah's call to the heavens and Earth: Say: \"Do you reject Him Who created Earth in two days, and make others equal to Him?

It is quite impossible for the human mind to truly grasp the vastness of the mysterious universe. However, we can try to estimate its scale. The Sun is one of the predicted 200-250 billion stars in our Milky Way galaxy. Considered one of the smaller stars, even though it is 333,000 times as massive as our own Earth, it is located 28,000 light years away from the center of the Milky Way, which itself is 100,000 light years across (one light year is equal to 9,460,800,000,000 kms or 5,879,000,000,000 miles.)

Each unfolding event will increase their panic and terror, and each passing moment will bring fresh suffering and peril. The awesome events they encounter will demonstrate Allah's majesty, Whom they had denied until then.

During these frightening minutes, they will encounter only a fraction of the suffering awaiting them. The Qur'an rec ounts this fear in some detail. People's Fear Allah tells people that although they passionately cling to the worldly life, their passion will not benefit them in the Hereafter. All of the things that they value, hold dear, and take risks for will bring nothing but loss if they were not done to win Allah's good pleasure. Every worldly attraction has been created as a test for humanity. The true life is in the Hereafter as the Qur'an reveals: To mankind the love of worldly appetites is painted in glowing colors: women and children, heaped-up mounds of gold and silver, horses with fine markings, and livestock and fertile farmland. All of that is merely the enjoyment of the life of this world. The best homecoming is in the presence of Allah. (Surah Al ‘Imran, 14) People desperately desire the worldly attractions mentioned in the verses, and can spend their entire lives pursuing them. The Qur'an says the following about the worldly life: Know that the life of this world is merely a game and a diversion, and ostentation and a cause of boasting among yourselves, and trying to outdo one another in wealth and children: like the plant-growth after rain, which delights the cultivators, but then it withers and you see it turning yellow, and then it becomes broken stubble. In the Hereafter, there is terrible punishment but also forgiveness from Allah and His good pleasure. The life of this world is nothing but the enjoyment of delusion. (Surat al-Hadid, 20)"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"THE DAY OF JUDGMENT 44 For some, one of life's biggest ambitions is to show off one's wealth, sons and daughters, and other valuables. One of the most highly prized possessions is children. This is true for all societies and is pointed out specifically in the Qur'an. The desire to have children is learned at a young age. Children are simultaneously a cause for unnecessary competition between people as well as a source of reassurance for their future. Another ambition is the craving for property and wealth. As we know, people's aims, plans and efforts center around these ambitions. The craving for money and wealth clouds people's vision, moral values lose their importance, and materialism becomes the defining factor for their character. The Qur'an's morality, together with its commands and prohibitions, lose their precedence; amassing wealth becomes a goal itself, and personal gain becomes preeminent in relationships. On the Day of Judgment, however, everything will be reversed. People will forget all about what they used to value, for now they will realize that the objects of their desires have no more meaning. Their values will alter in moments, for wealth and children will have no value and parental emotions will lose their meaning. In the face of this Day's terror, they will forget their most loved people: their children. No one will remember his or her children, much less inquiring about their well-being. In every way, this will be a very hard Day for the unbelievers. On the Day, the sky is like molten brass and the mountains like tufts of colored wool. No good friend will ask about his friend, even though they can see each other.

It will be a hard Day for the unbelievers. (Surat al-Furqan, 25-26) Families will desert infants, and people will be confused as to what to do. The fear will strike so suddenly and forcefully that pregnant women will miscarry and mothers will forget about their breast-feeding children: On the day they see it, every nursing woman will be oblivious of the baby at her breast, and every pregnant woman will abort the contents of her womb... (Surat al-Hajj, 2) All people who rejected the appeals to believe and so became oblivious to their only true friend and creator, Allah, will want to avoid one another. They will be so preoccupied with themselves, that friendship, lineage, and family bonds will cease to exist: The Day a man will flee from his brother and his mother and his father, and his wife and his children. On that Day every man among them will have concerns enough of his own. (Surah ‘Abasa, 34-37) People W ill Act as if Drunk People will lose all their calmness, self-control, and, self- confidence.

However, this Day's events will leave no doubt in people's mind that escape is impossible, even before death comes to them. The unbelievers will find themselves confronted with a Day that they did not expect to meet, despite being warned of it, a Day on which the existence of a Creator and a Sustainer of the universe will become clear for everyone to see, but also on which everything will be destroyed in submission to His will. They never reflected on what comes after death, because they did not believe in Allah's or the Hereafter's existence, but they will come to realize clearly Allah's existence and power. They also will realize that there is no hope for salvation and that their new life is eternal. Their eternal suffering and sorrow will be incomparably worse than that Day's events, and the Qur'an says that the unbelievers will prefer death over such a life: We have warned you of an imminent punishment on the Day when a man will see what he has done, and the unbeliever will say: \"Oh, if only I were dust!\" (Surat an-Naba', 40) People's panic, terror and astonishment will make them appear drunk, for: . . . And you will think people drunk when they are not drunk; it is just that the punishment of Allah is so severe. (Surat al- Hajj, 2) The physical and behavioral changes in people experiencing extreme fear are very similar to those of drunken people.

(Surat at-Takwir, 4-5)"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"ALLAH CREATED THE UNIVERSE Many different theories have been posited to explain the universe's creation. Some people, who disregarded the scientific evidence about the beginnings of the universe, suggested that matter has always existed. One hypothesis put forward to support this view is the \"Steady-state Hypothesis.\" Comprehensive and long r esearch has revealed strong evidence that the universe has a beginning. The Steady-state hypothesis, on the other hand, has become a distant memory in the history of science. Data shows that the universe came into being from nothing. Accordingly, the universe has an explosive beginning: the \"Big Bang.\" Before that, there was nothing: no matter, energy, space, time, or a universe. As a consequence of an explosion of an infinitely dense, zero volume point, matter was blasted out at an incredible speed in all directions, forming stars, planets and other heavenly bodies. The universe expanded, inflated, grew rapidly, and, over time, cooled and assumed its present shape. At the present time, most books on cosmology, science journals, and articles on the subject, as well as supporting evidence, assert that the universe began with a Big Bang and therefore has a certain age. As it is impossible to squeeze all of this written material into a few lines, we will provide one or two examples. Professor George O. Abell (University of California) states that although the steady-state universe appeals to materialists, it has to be abandoned in the face of new evidence:"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"THE DAY OF JUDGMENT 50 The steady-state universe is infinite and eternal and has much philosophical appeal. But we have already seen that certain objects, especially quasars, change as the universe ages, which violates the perfect cosmological principle. Moreover, we shall see subsequently that there is direct evidence that the universe has evolved from a hot, dense state, strongly supporting the idea of a big bang. 3 When American scientists announced the discovery of radiation patterns in space that may mark the beginning of time itself, astrophysicist George Smoot, leader of the research team said: \"What we have found is evidence for the birth of the universe—It's like looking at God. The order is so beautiful and the symmetry so beautiful that you think there is some design behind it.\" 4 Somewhere else, he added: \" It is a mystical experience, like a religious experience. It really is like finding the driving mechanism for the universe.\" 5 Given that the universe has a beginning, it has to have been made from nothing. In other words, it was created. If there was a creation, there has to be a creator. This universe was created without a preceding model and even before time and space existed. The most crucial fact discovered by this theory is that the universe has a beginning and an absolute and all-powerful creator. Allah created the universe! The Big Bang is the first movement that we can calculate in the universe. Every single move and event since that moment has happened by Allah's will and under His control. It is unacceptable as well as irrational to assume that matter dispersed by an unconscious explosion could form, by itself, such a galactic order, star systems, and the solar system to which our planet belongs. Everything that can be observed in the environment, including one's own body, has been created in an infinite order within Allah's control and knowledge. The Qur'an reveals that He first created the"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"Allah Created the Universe 51 heavens, then Earth, and finally living beings. Allah created the universe with a very delicate balance and order. Countless factors are interlinked with one another, from the proportion of the atmosphere's different gases to Earth's surface temperature, from the speed of rainfall to the iron content of Earth's core. The force of gravity, which keeps all of the stars and planets in their respective orbits, is another example of this. All matter in the universe is subject to gravitational forces, according to its size. Earth's gravitational force holds the oceans and everything else, including living beings, firmly on Earth's surface. This way, people and other creatures, as well as oceans and mountains, do not fall into the void of space. Earth's mass is of crucial importance here: If its mass had been slightly larger, it would have exerted a greater pull on everything on the planet's surface. Consequently, groundwater would have receded, people would have been unable to walk, water could not have reached the tree branch's leaves, vegetation would have disappeared, and blood circulation would have become dysfunctional and concentrated the blood in the feet. All of these and similar examples prove that Earth's mass is adjusted in such a way to sustain its ecological systems and life forms. Scientists investigating the universe's eventual end believe that everything is in the process of decaying, and that the universe's end will be a result of this decay. They suggest that even one unstable proton could cause this event, and warn of this great danger: Cosmic entropy, if it is real, will continue for centuries but when it happens, nothing will remain, no stars, people, poems, atoms or memories... After pointing out this fact, our attention is drawn to the real danger:"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"THE DAY OF JUDGMENT 52 Not one research project and not one experiment ever undertaken has been able to prove the disappearance of a single proton. However, this has not discouraged scientists from continuing to research in this field. For scientists to witness a proton decay would mean that the universe is face to face with the threat of annihilation. The obliteration of even just one proton means that everything in the universe is decaying, The decay of a single proton would demonstrate that all protons decay and that therefore atoms, molecules, and DNA could not be formed. 6 These few examples are enough to prove that the universe was created by a superior power, who gave it a great order and balance. Our all-powerful Lord protects and watches over this faultless order, for: Allah keeps a firm hold on the heavens and Earth, preventing them from vanishing away. And if they vanished, no one could then keep hold of them. Certainly He is Most Forbearing, Ever- Forgiving. (Surah Fatir, 41) Allah reveals in the Qur'an that everything in the universe will end. It is obvious that Allah, Who created and sustains this universe, can destroy it whenever He wills. On this great Final Day, all existing orders will cease, and everything that people admired, investigated and incessantly tried to comprehend will be turned on its head, for: His command when He desires a thing is just to say to it, \"Be!\" and it is. Glory be to Him Who has the Dominion of all things in His Hand. To Him you will be returned. (Surah Ya Sin, 82-83) THE UNIVERSE'S EVENTUAL DESTRUCTION Our world is surrounded by deadly threats. Surprisingly, even"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"Allah Created the Universe 53 though we know of such dangers, many of us live as if no life- threatening danger faces the universe and as if our lives were guaranteed. Many of us do not reflect upon death or what comes after death. Our world is on a long journey in an endless space. In reality, the factors making this journey possible are more numerous than anticipated. Earth faces many dangers on this journey: from comets to falling stars, from black holes to supernova explosions. It must stay in its orbit around the Sun, revolving at a constant speed on its axis, following a spiral path at the required angle to the Sun, and maintain all of the prevailing balances in its systems for life to be possible on it. However, there is no reason why external dangers should not destroy these balances. Scientists, who point out these dangers at every opportunity, agree that Earth could face such dangers at any time. As Professor Carl Sagan says: The earth is a lovely and more or less placid place. Things change but slowly. We can lead a full life and never personally encounter a natural disaster more violent than a storm. And so we become complacent, r elaxed, unconcerned. But in the history of Nature, the record is clear. W orlds have been devastated. Even we humans have achieved the dubious technical distinction of being able to make our own disasters, both intentional and inadvertent. On the landscapes of other planets where the records of the past have been preserved, there is abundant evidence of major catastrophes. It is all a matter of time scale. An event that would be unthinkable in a hundred years may be inevitable in a hundred million. Even on Earth, even in our own century, bizarre natural events have occurred. 7 It would not be surprising to see the universe destroyed by some of the things mentioned earlier. Maybe all of the things Allah says"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"will happen on the Day of Judgment will happen because Earth's equilibrium will be damaged. No doubt, damaging the faultlessly functioning order could cause many catastrophes, and maybe, the Last Day, which people consider unlikely or far in the future, is just r ound the corner. THE PROBABLE CAUSES OF EARTH'S DEATH The countless factors that enable our world to continue its existence must be present at the same time and in the same way as they are. Many scientists are studying how to preserve these natural balances. A small example: Scientists and environmentalists predict that it will not be possible to reduce the economic and environmental damage caused by the consumption of such fossil fuels as oil and coal. 8 Experts in the field say that the following disaster scenarios will be caused by the escalating consumption of fossil fuels in the very near future: 1. The deltas of the world's greatest rivers, like the Ganges or the Nile, will be flooded and lost, and one-quarter of Bangladesh's territory, together with all of China's deltas, will be underwater. 2. The Maldives and other islands and island states will be submerged. 3. Great areas of fertile countries (e.g., the US Midwest, Europe, and Kazakhstan) will become deserts, and Turkey will resemble the Sahara. 4. The frozen landmasses of Siberia and Canada will partially defrost, causing the destruction of pipelines, rail tracks, and buildings. 5. One-third of all forests will be destroyed. Due to this reduced amount of vegetation, the lungs of our world, the proportion of THE DAY OF JUDGMENT 54"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"carbon dioxide in the atmosphere will increase. This will fuel the global warming process and lead to various epidemic health problems. 6. In tropical areas, typhoons, cyclones, and other natural disasters will occur more often. Such currents as the Gulf Stream and El Niño in the Pacific and Atlantic oceans will alter their courses and turn the climatic conditions on land as well as the sea upside down. 7. In Texas and along Europe's Mediterranean coastline, such infectious diseases as malaria will become epidemic. 8. One-quarter of all glaciers and permanent ice in the Alps and the Himalayas will melt. The resulting waters will flood many coastline towns, and many island states will be submerged. The estimated 100 million people living in the affected areas will either die or become homeless migrants. 9 All of the above dangers have been predicted by scientific r esearch. Once Earth begins this process, only Allah will be able to stop it. The 25 percent increase in carbon dioxide in 1997 alone increased the greenhouse effect, which caused the following events: parts of polar glaciers melted, icebergs melted and raised the oceans' water levels, colder winters than usual, extreme rainfall, and devastating hurricanes and floods. The hole in the ozone layer exposed Earth to harmful radiation from space, increased cancer rates, caused new illnesses to be identified and diagnosed, and r evealed degenerative developments in plant life. American scientists and Greenpeace activists discovered during their research in Alaska that the Bering Glacier has shrunk by 12 kms (7.5 miles) in length and 130 m 2 (155 square yards) in size. 10 The ocean's water temperature increased by 0.8 degrees; corals, which play a vital role in the ecosystem's balance, began to die; and 80 percent of the Allah Created the Universe 55"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"THE DAY OF JUDGMENT 56 plankton was destroyed. 11 Over the last few centuries, many new probable causes for the world's end have emerged, and their number continues to increase every day. Our planet's current situation contains a strong message: Earth's end is a certainty, and its time is approaching. Physicists, in particular, frequently express their concerns about this, as follows: If the universe has a finite stock of order, and is changing irreversibly towards disorder—ultimately to thermodynamic equilibrium—two very deep inferences follow immediately. The first is that the universe will eventually die, wallowing, as it were, in its own entropy. This is known among physicists as the \"heat death\" of the universe. The second is that the universe cannot have existed for ever, otherwise it would have r eached its equilibrium end state an infinite time ago. Conclusion: the universe did not always exist. 12 It is surprising that so many people continue to live without considering their own end and being in awe of Allah, and remain totally absorbed by their worldly lives despite the proximity of death. And, it is even more surprising that most people, when re minded of death and the ensuing hardships, consider it a distant possibility. As they reject the Qur'an outright, its descriptions of the Day of Judgment have no meaning for them. They behave as if they will live forever, and so endanger the eternal life for the sake of a temporary life. Death, which people try to avoid at all costs, will find all of them, for neither humanity nor the universe can avoid or prevent death. The Qur'an reveals this reality, as follows: Say: \"Death, from which you are fleeing, will certainly catch up with you. Then you will be returned to the Knower of the Unseen and the Visible, and He will inform you about what you did.\" (Surat al-Jumu‘a, 8)"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"Allah Created the Universe 57 Given that Earth's destruction is a physical fact rather than a belief, the factors that will contribute to its end reveal themselves in the light of scientific discoveries. Even people who do not believe in Allah or any other religion must acknowledge that the universe is approaching its inevitable end. Hence, a new reality besides belief in the Day of Judgment and the Hereafter emerges. This is a frightening reality, because it means endless nothingness. The signs of the approaching Last Day leave people with a number of options: Some unbelievers see it is an endless nothingness, whereas believers see it is either eternal pleasure or eternal suffering... THE END OF THE UNIVERSE: THE CLOSED UNIVERSE AND OPEN UNIVERSE MODELS Scientists agree that the Big Bang theory is irrefutable and wholly based on scientific data. Accordingly, the universe was born out of the sudden explosion of an infinitely dense point and its subsequent rapid expansion and growth in space. Over time, it began to cool and assumed its current shape. So, for how long will this expansion continue? The greater an object's mass, the greater its gravitational force—to the extent that the gravitational force will overwhelm the rate of expansion. However, if the gravitational force is smaller, expansion cannot be prevented. According to scientists, if the universe's mass exceeds a certain limit, the expansion will cease one day and the universe will collapse back in on itself. This is the closed universe model. But if its mass is below this limit, the gravitational forces will be unable to overcome expansion and so it will continue to expand infinitely. This is the open universe model."},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"THE DAY OF JUDGMENT 58 The universe will either close and end, or expand until it is exhausted and then end, unless Allah causes it to end in another way. In order to predict by which model the universe will die, we need to know its total mass. As determining this is very difficult, scientists have tried to measure its density rather than its mass, because if the density r eaches a critical point, its gravity may overcome the expansion of galaxies. Thus, the universe would begin to collapse by sucking in all of the galaxies. But if its density does not reach this critical value, the expansion will continue forever, because gravity cannot overcome the the galaxies' expansion. Scientists setting out from this premise undertook to discover the end of the universe. They conducted many experiments and spent endless hours analyzing light from distant galaxies through telescopes. The speed of galactic systems was measured; their size, intensity, and distance were calculated; and the universe's real density was r esearched. The emerging data confirms that the universe's present density is close to critical density. In other words, it is more probable that the universe is closed. Once the data obtained by the American scientists Edwin Loh and Earl Spillar—research that is based on the study of thousands of galaxies—was added to the existing data in 1986, the probability of the universe being closed reached 90 percent. Furthermore, several factors were disregarded while calculating the universe's density, which led to the 90 percent figure. For instance, black holes were not taken into account. If they had been, the density value would have increased by a certain amount. Once the dark matters' density—present in all galaxies—is added to the equation, the emerging picture shows that the universe will cease to"},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"Allah Created the Universe 59 expand and collapse within itself. Dr. John Gribbin, a well-known physicist and science writer, also stated that the evidence for the closed universe model has never been so strong. 13 Phrasing it differently, the universe has reached a critical point and is ready to implode at any time. Allah reveals that one day He will return the universe to its original state, as follows: That Day We will fold up Heaven like folding up the pages of a book. As We originated the first creation so shall We bring it back again. It is a promise binding on Us. That is what We will do. (Surat al-Anbiya', 104) It is highly probable that this verse indicates the closed universe model. What we have related here shows that scientific data implies that the universe is likely to implode. Moreover, the guardians of materialist ideologies can posit no serious counterclaim in the face of such research results. Dr. Scherman, dean of the University of Chicago's astronomy department, says that whereas the closed universe idea used to be re presented chiefly by religion and philosophy, there is now much experimental as well as theoretical evidence that proves its correctness. 14 Our universe has been expanding for 15 billion years, but according to the obtained results and at the time when Allah wills, gravity probably will overcome expansion and bring it to a close. Once gravity becomes the dominant force in a closed and extremely dense universe, everything will begin to implode and be reversed, for all that had until then been cooling and expanding will contract and heat up. As a result, all of the galaxies will be rapidly brought closer to one another. According this model, gravity will end the universe's expansion"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"THE DAY OF JUDGMENT 60 and cause the galaxies to move toward one another at escalating speeds. Devastating collisions will take place; huge stars will collide and fuse. The Moon, the Sun, and Earth, as well as all other stars and planets, will fuse, and at the end of this process the imploding universe will be concentrated in one point and destroyed. The whole universe will be turned upside down. Given that a small deviation in Earth's orbit would lead to either the burning up or freezing to death of all living beings, that a small hole in the atmosphere can have devastating effects, and that a change to the 23 o 27' angle of Earth's axis would prevent the seasons, it is not difficult to estimate the negative effect of the universe's contraction on the precarious balances upon which its order rests. Allah reveals that the Sun and the Moon will be fused together on the Day of Judgment. Perhaps these verses indicate the closed universe model. If contraction occurs, the world, our solar system's other planets and stars, as well as the Sun and the Moon, will merge. The Qur'an also reveals that the stars will fall from their places in the heavens in rapid succession (Surat at-Takwir, 2). This verse could indicate a closed universe model, because in this scenario the stars will leave their orbit and collide. In a contracting universe, time will move backwards, and so there could be similarities between the events taking place at that time on Earth and the events that occur when entering a black hole. As with everything else, gravitational forces will be reversed, Earth will disgorge its charges and be shaken, the mountains will be pulverized, and the oceans will overflow. We do not know how long this process will last, but these events will take place as Allah describes them in the Qur'an. We can summarize this as follows: If the closed universe model is true, the universe will merge in one point and be extinguished by"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"Allah Created the Universe 61 Allah. However, this does not mean that the expanding universe model will save the universe from destruction. If this scenario is true, it simply means that the universe will be destroyed in another way. Ever since it was created, the universe's density has continued to increase, and its temperature nearly reached absolute zero. The presently prevailing temperature in space is -270 o C—only 3 degrees warmer than absolute zero. 15 As long as the expansion continues, the universe's temperature will continue to decrease. A temperature of -270 o C is the most suitable for life to exist. 16 Even minor fluctuations will doom all life to death. This temperature cannot re main constant in an expanding universe. So, when it falls, humanity and all other living parts of creation will die. Confirmed findings of recent research suggest that the closed universe model is applicable. Although uncertain of exactly which model it might be, scientists agree that the fate of the universe will be the same: In both models the universe dies, albeit in different ways. As we have explained above, both models lead to the Last Day. However, there are other factors that can bring about the universe's end, such as the Sun's completion of its life cycle. Allah knows best. THE SUN COMPLETES ITS LIFE-CYCLE Stars are born, live for a certain period of time, and then die. Our Sun has a limited lifetime. Before the universe meets its end, the Sun might have completed its life cycle, which, in turn, means that Earth will have to die as well. The Sun is an estimated 5 billion years old. Every second, it"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"THE DAY OF JUDGMENT 62 converts 564 million tons of hydrogen into 560 million tons of helium. 17 The remaining 4 million tons of matter is converted into energy. When it reaches the phase in which it will burn up and use up its hydrogen, Earth's end will have come. At this stage, the abundant hydrogen in the Sun's core will be replaced by helium, and the core's temperature will increase from its present 20 million degrees to 100 million degrees Centigrade. While the Sun's core overheats, its outer layers will expand and its color will take on a red hue instead of its usual yellow. In this way, the Sun will become a \"red giant.\" Scientists make the following predictions: The Sun, so vital for earthly life, will bloat and expand in space; our solar system's planets will catch fire; and those small planets near to it will be destroyed. Despite the Sun's outer temperature remaining the same, nearby planets will be greatly affected by its heat radiation, which is caused by its increased volume. First Mercury and then Venus will burn up. The continuation of life on Earth depends on the preservation of the universe's many existing balances. For instance, if Earth were to come a little closer to the Sun, all life on it would die. Thus, Earth will be greatly affected by the expanding Sun way before its outer fringes reach it. By the time Mercury and Venus are engulfed in flames, all of Earth's natural conditions will have been destroyed and all life on it will have been destroyed. In a very short time, the extreme heat will evaporate the oceans and melt the rocks and mountains, which soon will become gases. In a moment, the planet will burn up and become a handful of ash scattered across the universe. Scientists reached this conclusion after studying stars that have a similar size to our own Sun. Many distant stars are becoming"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"Allah Created the Universe 63 \"red giants,\" which cause many extraordinary events in the universe. 18 When the giant Sun uses up its fuel, it will no longer be able to support the weight of its inner layers, and they will begin to collapse toward the core, eventually producing a small, dense, cool star called a white dwarf. After it becomes a white dwarf, it will cool slowly for billions of years, eventually becoming so cool that it will no longer emit light. Professor of Theoretical Physics and renowned science writer Paul Davies expresses his concerns about the Sun's decreasing energy levels in the following way: As far as the sun is concerned, it clearly cannot continue burning away merrily ad infinitum. Year by year its fuel reserves decline, so that eventually it will cool and dim. By the same token its fires must have been ignited only a finite time ago: it does not have unlimited sources of energy. 19 As a natural consequence of this process, the disaster issuing from the Sun is unavoidable. In addition, research reveals many other factors that could destroy Earth. METEORS The universe contains millions of moving large and small meteors. The consequences of a collision between these and a planet vary, according to the mass of the meteor involved. Scientists estimate that 1,000 tons to more than 10,000 tons of meteoritic material falls on the Earth each day. However, most of this material is very tiny—in the form of micrometeoroids or dust- like grains a few micrometers in size. 20 And most of the rest is r educed to ash partly because of the friction they encounter upon"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"entering the atmosphere. In other words, Earth's atmosphere protects us from possible catastrophes day after day. Somewhat distressingly, however, some meteors are large enough to destroy all life on Earth. Scientists have shown that meteor strikes in Earth's past have altered its geological and ecological landscape significantly. One meteorite, estimated to have a diameter of 60 kms (37 miles), exploded in the atmosphere above Tunguska in Siberia in 1908 and destroyed some 2,000 km 2 (770 square miles) of forest. Its explosive force was 1,000 times more powerful than the atom bomb dropped on Hiroshima. Fortunately, it exploded above a largely uninhabited area. If it had exploded above the Eiffel tower, it probably would have killed over 10 million people. 21 This event brought home to people the great threat of catastrophic natural disasters. This is how it happened: In the early morning hours of June 30, 1908, in Central Siberia, a giant fireball was seen moving rapidly across the sky. Where it touched the horizon, an enormous explosion took place. It leveled some 2,000 square kilometers [770 square miles] of forest and burned thousands of trees in a flash fire near the impact site. It produced an atmospheric shock wave that twice circled the Earth. For two days afterward, there was so much fine dust in the atmosphere that one could read a newspaper at night by scattered light in the streets of London, 10,000 kilometers [6,200 miles] away. 22 Eyewitnesses can give us clues about other potential disasters: I was sitting on the porch of the house at the trading station of Vanovara at breakfast time and looking towards the north. I just raised my axe to hoop a cask, when suddenly... the sky was split in two, and high above the forest the whole northern part of the sky appeared to be covered with THE DAY OF JUDGMENT 64"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"fire. At the moment I felt a great heat, as if my shirt had caught fire... I wanted to pull off my shirt and throw it away, but at that moment there was a bang in the sky, and a mighty crash was heard. I was thrown on the ground about three sajenes [about 7 meters or 23 feet] away from the porch and for a moment I lost consciousness. My wife ran out and carried me into the hut. The crash was followed by a noise like stones falling from the sky, or guns firing. The Earth trembled, and when I lay on the ground I covered my head, because I was afraid that stones might hit it. At that moment when the sky opened, a hot wind, as from a cannon, blew past the huts from the north. It left its mark on the ground... 23 We do not know from where the next meteor might come or strike. According to scientists, every 2 centuries a meteor the size of the T unguska one collides with Earth, a fact that illustrates the proximity of such disasters. There is no reason why the next impact should not occur on a densely populated area. At present, scientists are very concerned about such an impact's potential consequences, for: If such an impact occurred today it might be mistaken, especially in the panic of the moment, for a nuclear explosion. The cometary impact and fireball would simulate all effects of a one-megaton nuclear burst, including the mushroom cloud, with two exceptions: there would be no gamma radiation or radioactive fallout. 24 The impact of such a massive object on a large city could kill millions of people. If it fell in the ocean, it would still be devastatingly dangerous, for its velocity and mass would create tidal waves that would destroy the shoreline's populated areas. Allah Created the Universe 65"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"THE DAY OF JUDGMENT 66 Furthermore, the likelihood of much larger meteors colliding with Earth is highly probable and gives food for thought. Scientists consider such an event inevitable, and say that it would be able to destroy whole continents and fill the atmosphere with toxic gases. They also readily admit that they are still fervently looking for a solution. ASTEROIDS AND COMETS Scientist state that the probability of a collision between Earth and some of the known asteroids increases by the day. Duncan Smith, reader in space technology at the University of Salford said scientists had identified more than a thousand asteroids, of various dimensions, that have orbits around the Sun that cross the path of the Earth. Scientists say that big asteroids have hit Earth before and it is only a matter of time before one strikes the Earth again. 25 Each year, many fragments of debris hit our planet, but most of them are so small that they burn up harmlessly in the atmosphere, unnoticed by us. However, some of this material is larger than what the atmosphere can handle. Geologist Walter Alvarez lists the probable events of a comet (shooting star) entering Earth's atmosphere in his book T -Rex and the Crater of Doom where he describes the world 65 million years ago: Doom was coming out of the sky, in the form of an enormous comet or asteroid—we are still not sure which it was. Probably ten kilometers across, traveling tens of kilometers a second, its energy of motion had the destructive capability of a hundred million hydrogen bombs. If an asteroid, it was an inert, crater-scarred rock, dark and sinister, invisible until the last moment before it struck. If a comet, it was a ball of dirty ice, spewing out gases boiled off by the heat of the Sun, and it"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"announced impending doom with a shimmering head and a brilliant tail splashed across half the sky, illuminating the night, and finally visible even in the daytime as Armageddon approached. 26 Scientists believe that a very large celestial body (most probably a comet) collided with Earth 65 million years ago and marked it considerably. Based on this experience and subsequent collisions, it is possible to predict the events following such an impact and the probable consequences for our planet. The potential energy of a comet before impact is equivalent to 100 billion megatons of TNT, which will cause it to evaporate in seconds and can leave a crater 40 kms (25 miles) deep. In comparison, a hydrogen bomb has the force of 1 megaton of TNT. At the height of the cold war, there were 10,000 such weapons. On the other hand, a comet's potential force is 10 million times greater than the force of all of the explosives that existed at that time. The Qur'an reveals that on the Day of Judgment there will be shocking tremors, that everything will be leveled, and that the oceans will boil over. A collision with a comet or an asteroid could cause all of these disasters. Massive seismic waves would disturb the ocean beds, causing landslides and huge tidal waves. Scientists re mark that previous tidal waves caused in this way were of such a magnitude that they left their marks on the ocean bed. Recent research reveals that a large object that fell into the Gulf of Mexico created large-scale tidal waves headed for Florida. While traveling toward their destination, they grew even larger and endangered the coast. They eventually destroyed large areas of forest. Although many people live as if their death and the Day of Judgment will never come, there is no reason why such a catastrophe should not occur. For instance, one day before the above catastrophe occurred, the soil covering great swathes of America Allah Created the Universe 67"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"and Mexico were fertile; soon after it struck, however, all of it was re ndered useless. 27 Fourteen centuries ago, Allah revealed that on the Day of Judgment the sky will split apart (Surat al-Haqqa, 16) and will be like molten brass (Surat al-Ma‘arij, 8). This scenario resembles the effects of a comet or a large meteor colliding with Earth. Paul Davies, in his book The Last Three Minutes , says that a comet on a collision course with Earth will emit such an intense light that the atmosphere will begin to burn up from above and melt like metal. He also states that the escaping gases in the vacuum of space will create a tornado. These statements are quite similar to what the Qur'an says, as follows: When Heaven is split apart and goes rose-red, like dregs of oil. (Surat ar-Rahman, 37) The melting and running of the heavens like molten brass or dregs of oil is reminiscent of a hot, thick-flowing liquid. In such a case, the skies would take on a red-hot color. As Davies states, on that Day the superheated gases could form tornados, and the r esemblance thereof to a red rose is obvious. Allah will bring the Day of Judgment at a predetermined time and fulfill His promises. These events may take place one by one, or all at once. Similar things have happened before, for both asteroids and comets have caused localized and, at other times, widespread, damage. Only Allah knows the time of the next one. Scientists predict that an asteroid will come close to Earth in 2028. According to them, if it falls into the Atlantic Ocean, America and Europe will be submerged; if it falls onto land, it will be far more destructive. Asteroids entering the atmosphere would cause earthquakes and volcanic eruptions, the dust of which would veil Earth in darkness. Astronomers point out that even the proximity of THE DAY OF JUDGMENT 68"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"such a comet would pose a great danger to Earth. 28 Scientists refer to the Swift-Tuttle comet, which passed close by in 1993 and is expected to return in 2126. Calculations suggest a high probability of a collision, as it is expected to pass by at 2 weeks' distance—a close encounter indeed—and many scientists are genuinely concerned and worried about such a near miss. The inconsistent orbits of these objects create a continuous traffic, which means that Earth and other planets are constantly at risk. According to experts, Swift-Tuttle or some other object eventually will collide with Earth. Some of them could cause greater devastation than all of humanity's nuclear weapons combined. We just do not know when this will happen. Davies says \"when it does, it will be bad news for people. There will be an abrupt and unprecedented interruption in the history of our species.\" He says that a collision would almost certainly spell the end for humanity. 29 He deals extensively with this subject in his book The Last Three Minutes , in which he states that on the 21st of August 2126, Swift-Tuttle will strike Earth and thereby usher in our planet's final day. There is a great similarity between what he relates and what Allah reveals, as follows: The date: August 21, 2126. Doomsday. The place: Earth. ... The diminutive head of the comet belies its enormous destructive power. It is closing on planet Earth at a staggering 40,000 miles per hour, 10 miles every second—a trillion tons of ice and rock, destined to strike at seventy times the speed of sound. ... Directly above ground zero, the sky splits open. A thousand cubic miles of air are blasted aside.

The planet shudders with the force of ten thousand earthquakes. A shock wave of displaced air sweeps over the surface of the globe, flattening all structures, pulverizing everything in its path. The flat terrain around the impact site rises in a ring of liquid mountains several miles high, exposing the bowels of the Earth in a crater a hundred miles across. The wall of molten rock ripples outward, tossing the landscape about like a blanket flicked in slow motion... W ithin the crater itself, trillions of tons of rock are vaporized. Much more is splashed aloft, some of it flung out into space. Still more is pitched across half a continent to rain down hundreds or even thousands of miles away, wreaking massive destruction on all beneath. Some of the molten ejecta falls into the ocean, raising huge tsunamis that add to the spreading turmoil. A vast column of dusty debris fans out into the atmosphere, blotting out the sun across the whole planet. Now the sunlight is replaced by the sinister, flickering glare of a billion meteors, roasting the ground below with their searing heat, as displaced material plunges back from space into the atmosphere. 30 No doubt, this description is not farfetched. Just one comet can cause such damage, but we do not know when it will collide with Earth. Regardless of how much people try to deny the existence of the Day of Judgment, it can confront them as a possibility that is closer than they think, for the Qur'an reveals that: The Unseen of the heavens and Earth belongs to Allah. The matter of the Hour is only the blink of an eye away, or even nearer. Allah has power over all things. (Surat an-Nahl, 77) THE DAY OF JUDGMENT 70"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"BLACK HOLES At present, scientists believe that black holes of enormous mass exist in the center of many galaxies. Their massive gravitational force swallows its own radiation and everything else that comes within its vicinity, an action that only further increases their size and gravitational force. They can pull in stars many times their own size, planets, smaller black holes, and even whole galaxies. As our planet travels rapidly in the endless void of space, one day it might enter the gravitational zone of a black hole. Black holes are a most dense phenomenon that pulls in everything. Their gravitational force is so strong that nothing in its path can escape it. Just like a vacuum cleaner, black holes suck in everything in their gravitational spectrum: planets, satellites, asteroids, and even stars. Once they enter this field of gravity, they cannot escape. Why do black holes suck in everything? As we know, every object exerts a certain gravitational force. For example, if we throw a stone into the sky, it will go up until it exhausts its velocity and then falls to the ground by the force of gravity. For an object to escape Earth's gravity, it needs to exceed a certain speed in one direction (velocity). If a rocket is to break free of Earth's gravity, it must reach a velocity that can overcome gravity: 1 1.2 kms (7 miles) per second. To escape a black hole, the object must travel faster than the speed of light. However, since nothing can exceed the speed of light, nothing can escape a black hole's gravity, not even bundles of light traveling at a speed of 300,000 kms (190,000 miles) per second. Since not even light can escape, black holes are always dark. There is no r eason why our planet, traveling at high speeds through space, Allah Created the Universe 71"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"should not enter a black hole's gravitational field. In fact, scientists in America have disclosed the existence of two active black holes in the center of our galaxy, each of which can swallow up millions of stars larger than our Sun. The American Astronomers Association recently published a scientific report in which it says that one of the black holes is right in the center of our galaxy, just 26,000 light years away from Earth (one light year is almost 9.5 trillion kilometers, or nearly six trillion miles). It is called \"Sagittarius A\" or \"A-Star,\" 31 and is as large as our solar system but has a mass millions of times higher. Based upon calculations, its mass is 2.6 billions times that of the Sun and it sucks in stars at a speed of 965 kms (600 miles) per second. This is no doubt a serious discovery and poses a great danger to our planet. The other black hole, \"Old Faithful,\" is spherical in shape, is much larger, and is 40,000 light years away. It resembles an insatiable monster that swallows up all stars within its reach. The fact that A-Star swallows up the stars in its environment at a speed of 965 kms (600 miles) per second shows that its gravitational force increases with every star it swallows. Therefore, at the end of this process, the escalating speed with which it draws objects to itself will reach an incredible magnitude. As black holes swallow up light, they cannot be seen or perceived even by the most highly developed telescopes and other technology. Therefore, scientists must determine their existence through research and measurement. By using such tools, scientists have already proven the existence of several black holes. However, there is a strong probability that many more have not yet been discovered yet, as the current level of research is insufficient. Many scientists believe that our Sun has a twin, which likely became a black hole. The reasoning behind this assumption is that THE DAY OF JUDGMENT 72"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"Allah Created the Universe 73 all other stars in our solar system exist in groups of twos, threes, and fives, except for our Sun. The supporting evidence is considerable and is being analyzed. Considering that the Sun is only 150 million kms (93 million miles) away from Earth, the potential danger is undeniable. In short, there is no reason why Earth should not fall into a black hole's gravitational field at any given moment. Many scientists believe that a black hole will annihilate Earth by swallowing it. Even if Earth avoids this end, there is a great danger of a black hole's passing by our solar system. And, what would happen if a black hole quietly approached our solar system? Such an event could alter the orbits of many planets, which of course would affect Earth's balance. Hundreds and even thousands of asteroids could be affected by such a gravitational force. Many would be sucked in by the black hole, and hundreds or thousands of them would fall on Earth. COLLIDING GALAXIES There are an estimated 200 other galaxies besides our own in the universe, each of which consists of 200 billion stars, revolves around its own axis, and follows an orbit. Our galaxy is traveling at a high speed in the direction of an imaginary point called the Solar Apex near the bright star Vega. Due to all of this movement in the universe, collisions and huge explosions occur. But because they happen millions of light years away, we do not notice them. For instance, the Hubble telescope took pictures of two galaxies colliding some 63 million light years away. As a result of this event, new stars were born and massive hydrogen clouds were formed and released into space. If such a collision were to take place near Earth, it could become one of the factors that would destroy our"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"THE DAY OF JUDGMENT 74 planet. Furthermore, scientists state that such an end probably awaits our solar system. One such disclosure is the following: Astrophysicists speak of serious problems the Earth will have in the near future. The first of these is a supernova explosion (a supernova: a star that explodes and becomes extremely luminous in the process). Even if the time and location of this explosion is unknown, predictions put forward are looking at the near future and they are not very encouraging. According to scientists, the reddish supergiant Betelgeuse star at a distance of 430 light years, appears ready to explode. They r eckon that hypernovas are created by the fusion of black holes or by the merger of black holes with neutron stars. But none of them knows how these time bombs are distributed in space or what would happen to us if they were to come near our world. 32 The Qur'an reveals that on that Day, Earth will be rocked by devastating tremors; that people will experience pure terror; that the Sun, the Moon, and stars will be extinguished; and that everything will be destroyed rapidly. A collision could cause all of these events, and would affect not only Earth but our entire solar system as well. Scientific research reveals that the promised Day of Judgment will definitely come, that all living and non-living things and Earth too will be destroyed, and that Allah will create a new sky and a different world. All of this is related to point out that Earth can also die by natural causes. However, there is no doubt that Allah does not require a cause to do such things and that if Allah wills it, he can make the Day of Judgment happen at any time and even without the need for a collision or an explosion.

Regardless of how remote a possibility seems to people, r esearch and an increase in catastrophic events suggests that such a day is approaching.

Newspapers, magazines, television programs, and other media outlets often inform people of the latest scientific discoveries. Researchers who are aware of these facts are looking for ways to prevent such calamities in order to delay the universe's death.

(Surat ar-Rum, 25) They will say, \"Are we to be restored to how we were when we have become perished, worm-eaten bones?\" They say: \"That will clearly be a losing restoration!\" There will be but one Great Blast, and at once they will be on the surface, wide awake! (Surat an-Nazi‘at, 10-14) People act as if this world will exist forever. This is one of the greatest mistakes of their lives, for it causes them to think that the world's amazing order, created by Allah, is self-sufficient and eternal. But after they die, they will see that death does not finish everything; rather, it is the beginning of their eternal lives. Having believed that they would enter a realm of nothingness, they are suddenly gripped by terror when they hear the trumpet's second sounding. The scrolls of their deeds are not yet unfolded, nor have they had a taste of what is in store for them. Nevertheless, they say \"Woe to us!\" and rise from their graves. In reality, they knew that this day would come. The Qur'an describes their fear on that Day, as follows: They will say: \"Woe to us! Who has raised us from our"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"After the Universe Dies 85 resting place? This is what the All-Merciful promised us. The Messengers were telling the truth.\" (Surah Ya Sin, 52) Now it is too late, for their lives on Earth yielded neither true pleasure nor true comfort, and everything they had done until then only prepared for them this hardest of all days. They W ill T urn T o A Caller On that day they will follow the Summoner, who has no crookedness in him at all. Voices will be humbled before the All-Merciful, and nothing but a whisper will be heard. (Surah Ta Ha, 108) When people emerge from their graves and begin to run toward a call, the like of which they have never heard before, they will not stop running until they reach the place from where they were called. The believers will arrive contented and peaceful, whereas the unbelievers will arrive as if they had sensed what is awaiting them, saying over and over again \"This is a pitiless day!\" (Surat al-Qamar, 8). It is now time to assemble, and nothing can prevent it. Everyone who has ever lived will be gathered and begin to move rapidly, in surprise and submission to Allah, toward their punishment. Escape and returning to Earth are impossible, and all remorse is useless. Fear and terror will grip their whole being, for: The Day they will emerge swiftly from their graves, as if rushing to rally to the flag, eyes downcast, darkened by debasement, that will be the Day which they were promised. (Surat Ma‘arij, 43-44) [They say:] \"When we are dead and turned to dust and"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"THE DAY OF JUDGMENT 86 bones, will we then be raised up again alive? And our earlier ancestors as well?\" Say: \"Yes, and you will be in a despicable state.\" (Surat as-Saffat, 16-18) Unbelievers, who did not observe Allah's boundaries, were arrogant and disobedient on Earth, will now become very obedient and submissive. They will follow the call unconditionally, for they will not be able to act of their own volition. They will have surrendered to Allah and will bow to His will, whether they like it or not, because the ego-driven life that they led in the world is now over. They will clearly understand their incapacity in front of Allah, the severity of His punishment, and the truth thereof: T urn away from them then. On the Day the Summoner summons them to something unspeakably terrible. (Surat al-Qamar, 6) All people finally will realize that they have no option but to obey Allah and bow to His will. They will be unable to do otherwise, even if they wanted to. This promised Day is an exceedingly tragic one for the unbelievers. The terror of the Day of Meeting and the frightening experience of rising from the graves is undisputable. People will see their predecessors facing the same reality as they are and that Allah has kept His promise. They W ill Be Like Swarming Locusts Those who do not believe in the Hereafter have an evil likeness. Allah's is the Highest Likeness. He is the Almighty, the All-Wise. (Surat an-Nahl, 60)"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"After the Universe Dies 87 As the verse says, every example given by Allah depicts the situation in the most concise manner and the best possible way. For this reason, the Qur'an states that each of its verses is \"consummate wisdom\" (Surat al-Qamar, 5). Given this fact, every description given in the Qur'an enables us to visualize the Day of Judgment and the people's situation. No doubt, Allah's promise is true and all examples and depicted scenes will become true. For instance, the Qur'an likens people rising from their graves to swarming locusts, as follows: They will emerge from their graves with downcast eyes, like swarming locusts. (Surat al-Qamar, 7) This allegory enables us to visualize that moment in the best way. The swarming of locusts is unique. Migrating locusts travel in huge swarms and cause damage on a massive scale. Swarms can fly between 1,500 and 1,800 meters (4,900-5,900 feet) above the ground and they descend like a cloud formation. Locust swarms can migrate great distances very rapidly and remain airborne for long periods. Some swarms cover an area as large as 75 x 15 miles (120 x 25 kms), and contain about as much as 150 billion locusts. 33 Numbering in the billions, they literally appear out the blue, cover huge areas, and strip away all vegetation wherever they go. As the verses state, billions of people will suddenly appear on the ground after hearing the trumpet and, like locusts, will begin to move together toward the caller.

Holding Their Heads Up, They W ill Run T o One Point On that Day, the unbelievers' heads will be up in the air, their eyes fixed on one point only, and they will run as if hypnotized. They are only moving in the way prescribed by Allah and facing the call's direction. According to Allah's will, everybody except the believers, who are safe, will be gripped by a great fear: Each of them will come to Him on the Day of Resurrection all alone. As for those who believe and do right actions, the All-Merciful will bestow His love on them. (Surah Maryam, 95-96) The unbelievers will run in fear and astonishment, unable to look at others or themselves. It does not even occur to them to do so. On the Day of Judgment, wealth, children, or worldly ambitions will lose their value. Everybody will be in a state of unconditional obedience, and the only thing of value is faith. Allah describes the unbelievers' state at that moment in the following way: Do not consider Allah to be unaware of what the wrongdoers perpetrate. He is merely deferring them to a Day on which their sight will be transfixed, rushing headlong—heads back, eyes vacant, hearts hollow.

People's rising from their graves to be judged and their running will end with them congregating in the Lord's presence, as follows: They will be paraded before your Lord in ranks: \"You have come to Us just as We created you at first. Yes indeed! Even though you claimed that We would not fix a time with you.\" (Surat al-Kahf, 48) Ag r eat majority of people did not believe that this meeting would ever take place. But on that great Day, they will be captured and realize its truth and that they cannot escape it. GATHERING FOR THE JUDGMENT Allah has designed this moment of truth, as befits His power and glory, which the unbelievers disregarded and evaded all their lives, whereas the believers were preparing themselves for it. Jibril and all the angels will assemble in rows for the judgment, all people will be judged fairly, and those who speak will only be able to speak the truth: On the Day when the Spirit and the angels stand in ranks, no one will speak, except for him who is authorized by the All-Merciful and says what is right.

(Surat an-Naba', 17- 18) The Qur'an reveals that the believers' faces will be radiant and they will be gazing at their Lord, whereas the unbelievers will not even raise their heads because of their shame. Their behavior at that moment will be as follows: Faces will be humbled to the Living, the All-Sustaining, and anyone weighed down with wrongdoing will have failed. (Surah Ta Ha, 111) When we add the billions of people who are living now to all of the people who lived in the past and will live in the future, we can get an impression of the astonishing scenes of the huge mass of people rising from their graves. People will gather, see, and comprehend clearly one another, what they have done, and what is going on, because their sight will be sharp: [On the Day of Threat, they will be told:] \"You were heedless of this, so We have stripped you of your covering and today your sight is sharp.\" (Surah Qaf, 22) All the people one has ever known will be there.

They may have been presidents, musicians, artists, or rich. But such \"superiority\" no longer matters, and money, office, and other marks of worldly distinction will lose their value. In other words, both the admired as well as the admirer will be in the same situation, for: On the Day We gather them all together... (Surah Yunus, 28) Say: \"Allah gives you life, then causes you to die, and then will gather you together for the Day of Resurrection, about which there is no doubt. But most people do not know it.\" (Surat al- Jathiya, 26) On that Day, worldly status and wealth will have no value, no one will follow in the footsteps of another, and no one will try to impress anyone else. Aristocrats, the rich, the rulers, and the bosses will be held accountable for their sins in the same way as all the ordinary people, and the only superiority will be one's closeness to Allah. All people will understand clearly that nothing but trying to win Allah's approval and good pleasure has any value, and they will know with certainty that Allah is the sole possessor of everything. And, as the Qur'an relates, the unbelievers who encounter this reality will be unable to return to their former lives to make amends or to help one another: Then when the Trumpet is blown, that Day there will be no family ties between them; nor will they ask about one another.

You are toiling laboriously toward your Lord, but you will meet Him! (Surat al-Inshiqaq, 6) Such events like going to university, graduating, marrying, or having children are considered turning points in a person's life. People with worldly ambitions count the days, make plans, and prepare for the day when they will achieve their ambitions. They admit that their lives are geared toward these ends and that they live for such goals. But in reality, humanity was created to serve Allah. Even if they do not acknowledge it, deep down they know it. However, people consider this life to be eternal and spend it trying either to forget or completely ignore the reason for their creation. Regardless of what they do while alive, their final destination is Allah's presence: the moment of justice on the Day of Judgment. Every passing day brings us a little closer to that Day. Every hour, minute, and second is a new step toward resurrection and judgment. This progress, which cannot be reversed or stopped, is followed by everyone, for: Certainly it is to Us they will return. Then their reckoning is Our concern. (Surat al-Ghashiya, 25-26) When that time comes, everything will reach its conclusion and there will be no way to go back and make amends. All of those who disregarded the truth, shown to them by their conscience, will experience a previously unknown degree of astonishment and panic. All of those who rejected Allah's existence and unity will undergo an unequaled punishment, for His Messengers warned and informed them how to live and invited them to the true religion.

And now everybody has become sure about Who created them, why He created them, what was required of them, and that they will be returned to Allah. They chose to fool themselves with a devilish boldness, even though they knew about it, and so will be punished accordingly. On that Day, everybody will be told what they did and what they postponed: On the Day Allah raises up all of them together, He will inform them of what they did. Allah has recorded it while they have forgotten it. Allah is a Witness of all things. (Surat al-Mujadala, 6) That Day people will emerge segregated to see the results of their actions. Whoever does an atom's weight of good will see it. Whoever does an atom's weight of evil will see it. (Surat az- Zilzal, 6-8) Allah calls all people to prepare for the moment of truth: \"... Whatever good you do, Allah knows it. Take provision; but the best provision is doing your duty ( taqwa )...\" (Surat al-Baqara, 197). Those who listened to their consciences and followed Allah's call will not know fear or sorrow on that Day, whereas the unbelievers will experience a remorse for which they cannot atone. As the Qur'an states: And that Day Hell is produced, that Day man will remember; but how will the remembrance help him? He will say: \"Oh!

As on Earth, His justice will govern the questioning of deeds and their final reward or punishment. Everyone will receive justice based upon the placement of \"just scales\": We will set up the Just Balance on the Day of Resurrection, and no self will be wronged in any way. Even if it is no more than the weight of a grain of mustard-seed, We will produce it. We are sufficient as a Reckoner. (Surat al-Anbiya', 47) Every deed will be put on these scales, which will decide one's eternal suffering or eternal salvation or happiness. People whose good deeds weigh heavier will go to Paradise, but those whose good deeds weigh less will receive a fearsome punishment: being cast into Hell. The verses say: As for him whose balance is heavy, he will have a most pleasant life. But as for him whose balance is light, his motherland is Hawiya. And what will convey to you what that is?

Prophets who advised and reminded people of their duty to serve Allah and the other witnesses will be with those who will be questioned on that Day. These witnesses will do no wrong. Nobody will be able to claim that they did not know that their duty was to serve Allah, for every member of humanity has been informed of this fact by Allah's Messengers. Nor will they be able to deny, in His presence, what they have done. All of their good as well as evil deeds will be exposed. Even if they deny the truth, the witnesses will be just and expose their lies. Every nation will be present with its own book and leader ( imam ) in this great order in our Lord's presence.

Some of the verses in this regard are the following: On the Day We crowd the enemies of Allah into the Fire and they are driven in close-packed ranks, when they reach it [the Fire], their hearing, sight, and skin will testify against them concerning what they did. They will ask their skins: \"Why did you testify against us?\" and they will reply: \"Allah gave us speech, as He has given speech to everything. He created you in the first place, and you will be returned to Him. You did not think to shield yourselves from your hearing, sight, and skin testifying against you, and you thought that Allah would never know much of what you did. It is that thought you had about your Lord that has destroyed you, so now you find yourselves among the lost.\" If they are steadfast, the Fire will still be their residence! If they ask for favor, no favor will be given. (Surah Fussilat, 19-24) People can find a plausible (as well as an implausible) explanation for whatever they do, and can even make themselves believe in it. The only thing wanted at such a moment is convincing oneself or the other party. In other words, they believe in what they want, devise a logic in support thereof, and provide explanations based on that.

THEY WILL BE CALLED TO ACCOUNT ALONE In addition, those who expected to receive their friends' help will find themselves giving account for their deeds \"alone.\" This will cause the unbelievers to see the pointlessness of expecting anyone or anything other than Allah to help them. They will receive the due r eturns of such an error. The Qur'an reveals the reality of giving such an account alone, as follows: Each of them will come to Him on the Day of Resurrection alone. (Surah Maryam, 95) To be alone is one of the scariest thoughts for people, especially in times of hardship. It is painful to be lonely, even under the conditions of life on Earth. In the Hereafter, loneliness will not be the only problem. The worst will be the unbelievers' strong fear of the moment of justice, because they will be painfully aware of the evil they committed. Nobody in whom they can trust or from whom they can seek help and support will be nearby, and not even their most trusted and close family members will care about them.

(Surat al-Haqqa, 18) Every self will be repaid in full for what it did. He knows best what they are doing. (Surat az-Zumar, 70) All of the unbelievers' sins will be fully exposed. People who lied throughout their lives even to their families and closest friends, committed fraud and took every conceivable risk to satisfy their self-interest, who denied Allah's Messengers and rejected their words, thinking that such things would never be exposed, will be called to account alone, for: On the Day when the secrets are sought out and man will have no strength or helper. (Surat at-Tariq, 9-10) NO FRIENDSHIP, FAMILY, OR CLOSENESS On that Day, people will not have the strength or the opportunity to deal with anyone but themselves. People will not even think about their families, which they so cherished and trusted. Due to their terror, they are totally preoccupied with themselves. The bonds between them and their ancestors, of whom they were so proud, for whom they prepared family trees and learned their history, will be severed, for: Then when the Trumpet is blown, that Day there will be no family ties between them; they will not be able to question one another. (Surat al-Mu'minun, 101) The strong forts in which they trusted and sought refuge, such as"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"After the Universe Dies 99 family wealth and their offices, all will be destroyed. Those who sought superiority and power from their ancestors' titles or inherited wealth, who thought that they would profit from a life re moved from the morality of religion and even considered this a sign of superiority, will now realize their mistake. On this Day, only faith has value. In societies divorced from the values of religion, the most important factor for friendship to develop and continue is self- interest. Self-interest seeks to invest in and guarantee one's future, obtain money, status, and connections. But on the Day of Judgment, no one will be in a state to seek pleasure, ambition, and lust, and so all friendships will be forgotten at once. The Qur'an says: [On that Day] no good friend will ask about his friend. (Surat al-Ma‘arij, 10) The fear will be so great that everybody would forsake all they have if only they could escape the fearsome punishment. Moreover, the wealth that they did everything to acquire will have lost its appeal. They would give all of Earth's wealth, if it belonged to them, as a ransom, along with their own wealth. All of the property that they possessed and guarded so closely will have lost its meaning. They would spend all of their wealth in the cause of Allah without a second thought, but now it is too late. Instead of using their wealth in the path of Allah, they used it during their short lives for temporary worldly gains and passions in a futile attempt to ensure that their names, deeds, and status would be remembered and preserved after they died. And so they disregarded this difficult day. The Qur'an reveals this dead-end situation, as follows: If those who did wrong owned everything on Earth, and the"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"THE DAY OF JUDGMENT 100 same again with it, they would offer it as a ransom to save themselves from the evil of the punishment on the Day of Resurrection. What confronts them from Allah will be something with which they did not reckon. (Surat az-Zumar, 47) He [Ibrahim] said: \"You have adopted idols apart from Allah as tokens of mutual affection in this world. But then on the Day of Resurrection, you will reject one another and curse one another. The Fire will be your shelter. You will have no helpers.\" (Surat al-‘Ankabut, 25) Despite being party to many hypocrisies, no unbelievers will acknowledge that their friendships were false. For many, the friendships and love they experienced were \"different from all others.\" In reality, they all made the same mistakes and did not experience true loyalty, not even on Earth. Furthermore, the offers that they will make on that Day to prevent their deserved punishment reveals their attitude toward friendship. Their families and friends, about whom they felt so strong while alive, will be considered a potential ransom. This fact is revealed in the Qur'an, as follows: [On that Day] no good friend will ask about his friend, even though they can see each other. An evildoer will wish that he could ransom himself from the punishment of that Day by means of his sons, his wife, his brother, or his family who sheltered him or everyone else on Earth, if that only meant that he could save himself. But no! It is a Raging Blaze. (Surat al- Ma‘arij, 10-15) By making this ransom, the unbelievers will finally expose their true character. All people will realize that even the closest"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"After the Universe Dies 101 r elationships on Earth were based on self-interest. And, due to the clear conflict of interest exposed by that Day, these friendships will have lost all their value. Allah gave them all of the blessings they had to try them for a predetermined time. The fact that they offer them as a ransom after the time is up reveals the unbelievers' inability to comprehend reality yet again. HANDING OUT THE BOOKS OF DEEDS All deeds are recorded by two angels: one on the right and one on the left. Each person receives his or her record on the Day of Judgment. Not a single deed can be denied, for nothing has been left out of this record. And, it is this record that will inform people of what they have prepared for themselves in the Hereafter. The believers will receive it in their right hands, and the unbelievers will re ceive it in their left hands. No one will be wronged, for each deed, no matter how small, will be accounted for. The believers receive their books in great joy and pass them to those who are nearby for them to read. Allah says in the Qur'an: On that Day you will be exposed—no concealed act you did will stay concealed. As for him who is given his Book in his right hand, he will say: \"Here, come and read my Book! I counted on meeting my Reckoning.\" He will have a very pleasant life in an elevated Garden, its ripe fruit hanging close to hand. \"Eat and drink with relish for what you did before in days gone by!\" (Surat al-Haqqa, 18-24) The Prophet says the following about the believers' reward: \"Verily, Allah does not treat a believer unjustly in regard to his virtues. He would confer upon him (His blessing) in this world and would give him"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"THE DAY OF JUDGMENT 102 re ward in the Hereafter.\" (Sahih Muslim). On the other hand, the unbelievers will be ashamed and in great fear. Their books, which they will receive with their left hands, will contain everything they did throughout their lives, and so will be full of deeds of which Allah does not approve. The verse below r eveals their fear and astonishment when confronted with this r eality, as follows: The Book will be set in place, and you will see the evildoers fearful of what is in it. They will say: \"Woe to us! What is this Book that does not pass over any action, small or great, without recording it?\" They will find there everything they did, and your Lord will not wrong anyone at all. (Surat al-Kahf, 49) Not fearing Allah, associating partners with Him, putting other people's approval above His, lying, gambling, fornicating, and all other sins will be recorded in their books. As they have not assessed Allah with the assessment due to Him, they believe that they can live as they wish with their hypocrisy and that they can put forward some ostentatious good deeds they did as factors for forgiveness. Thus, fear and astonishment awaits those who did not worship Allah or who just appeared to worship Him, for their intentions also are recorded. The unbelievers' hopeless remorse is clearly understandable from what they say, as the Qur'an reveals: But as for him who is given his Book in his left hand, he will say: \"If only I had not been given my Book and had not known about my Reckoning! If only death had really been the end! My wealth has been of no use to me. My power has vanished.\" (Surat al-Haqqa, 25-29) Another verse describes the difference between the believers, who believed in Allah and the Hereafter with certainty and"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"After the Universe Dies 103 prepared for the moment of truth, and the unbelievers, who forgot about the Hereafter and turned away from Allah and the believers, as follows: As for him who is given his Book in his right hand, he will be given an easy reckoning and return to his people joyfully. But as for him who is given his Book behind his back, he will cry out for destruction but will be roasted in a Searing Blaze. He used to be joyful among his people. He thought that he was never going to return. But, in fact, his Lord was always watching him! (Surat al-Inshiqaq, 7-15) PEOPLE WILL BE SEPARATED The moment awaited by those who lived according to Allah's boundaries has arrived. The believers will experience the joy of r eceiving what they were promised, whereas the unbelievers will experience an indescribable and great fear, one that they have never known before. The believers will not experience this fear. The Qur'an reveals that the believers and the unbelievers will be separated on this Day, for: This is the Day of Distinction [between the true and the false] that you used to deny. (Surat as-Saffat, 21) The Qur'an reveals that people will be separated into groups: the \"Companions of the Right\" (the believers) and the \"Companions of the Left\" (the unbelievers). Among the believers, are those who were at the forefront of the struggle on His path and were close to Him. The Qur'an refers to them as forerunners: [Some] faces that Day will be radiant, gazing at their Lord.

Those are the Ones Brought Near. (Surat al-Waqi‘a, 8-11) HELL WILL BE DISPLAYED On that Day, everybody will give an account of what they have done. Those who realize that they are destined for Hell will be full of r egret for preferring a short life to the eternal one. While they led lives of illusory comfort, believing that they would not be punished, that the Day of Judgment would not happen, and that Allah would not punish them, Allah caught them at an unexpected moment. Now it is all over, and everyone's place has been determined. The believers and the unbelievers, before they are separated, will be shown Hell. On that Day, every person will kneel around Hell, hear its fearsome seething and rasping, and witness its hair-raising scenes. Then the believers will be saved, while the unbelievers will be left kneeling, as follows: Man asks: \"When I am dead, will I then be brought out again alive?\" Does not man recall that We created him before, when he was not anything? By your Lord, We will collect them and the devils together. Then We will assemble them around Hell on their knees. Then We will drag out from every sect the one among them who is the most insolent toward the All-Merciful. Then We will know best those most deserving to roast in it.

(Surah Maryam, 66-72) There is obviously much wisdom in showing Hell to the believers. When they see the state of Hell from close up, they will fully realize the distinction and beauty of the faith given to them by Allah, because Hell is so frightening that their being saved from its suffering evokes a sense of sheer happiness and gratefulness. They are given the chance to compare Hell and Paradise, and so are far more appreciative of the value of Paradise's eternal and beautiful gifts. Only by comparison can the value of what is given be fully understood. Accordingly, part of the wisdom of creating Earth as a testing place is education. On Earth, people learn right and wrong, beauty and ugliness, and good and bad by seeing it all and making comparisons. They are able to do this because Allah gave them the abilities to reason, to use their conscience, and, most of all, to be in awe of Him. On the Day of Judgment, all believers, \"the best of creatures\" (Surat al-Bayyina, 7), will be separated eternally from the unbelievers, \"the worst of creatures\" (Surat al-Bayyina, 6), as follows: When the Messengers' time [for testimony] is appointed— until what day is that deferred? Until the Day of Distinction [between the true and the false]. And what will teach you what the Day of Distinction is? On that Day, woe to the unbelievers! Did We not destroy the earlier peoples, then succeed them with later ones? That is how We deal with evildoers. On that Day, woe to the unbelievers!

This difference makes itself known at the moment of death. Whereas the angels take the lives of believers nicely, they take the unbelievers' lives in a most agonizing manner. The angels greet the believers and give them the good tidings of Paradise and gently draw out their souls. All believers come face to face with the gateway to the eternal life (death), having prepared for it throughout their lives, knowing its inevitability. On the other hand, the unbelievers meet death with overwhelming pangs of regret, having tried to evade it all their lives, having known its existence and yet still having ignored its r eality. The Guards of Hell reach out for them, striking their faces and their backs, plucking out their souls harshly, which causes much pain, and then send them to a humiliating and burning punishment. One verse says: If only you could see when the angels take back those who did not believe at their death, beating their faces and their backs: \"Taste the punishment of the Burning!\" (Surat an-Anfal, 50) The believers have prepared for this Day all their lives, and have prayed to Allah that He may not disgrace them, as the following"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"THE DAY OF JUDGMENT 108 verse indicates: [Those who remember Allah say:] \"Our Lord, give us what You promised us through Your Messengers, and do not disgrace us on the Day of Resurrection.

(Surat al-Insan, 10-11) THE BELIEVERS ON THE DAY OF JUDGMENT Their Physical Condition On the Day you see the men and women of the believers, with their light streaming out in front of them, and to their right: \"Good news for you today of Gardens with rivers flowing under them, remaining in them timelessly, forever.

They will be \"laughing, rejoicing\" (Surah ‘Abasa, 39). The Qur'an describes the different facial expressions of the believers and the unbelievers, as follows: Those who do good will have the best and more!

Those are the Companions of the Fire, remaining in it timelessly, forever. (Surah Yunus, 26-27) The unbelievers will beg the believers for some of the light, although they had fought them while alive. The meaning of this light is illumination, safety, and joy. This light radiating from those who have earned Paradise will not benefit the unbelievers, re gardless of how much they want it. As its source is the good deeds done on Earth, the unbelievers, who have no store of such deeds, will not have any of it. For this reason, they will be told to go back to Earth in order to find some. The Qur'an informs us: That Day the men and women of the hypocrites will say to those who believe: \"Wait for us so that we can borrow some of your light.\" They will be told: \"Go back and look for light!\" And a wall will be erected between them with a gate in it, on the inside of which there will be mercy, but before whose exterior lies the punishment. (Surat al-Hadid, 13) The believers will receive the reward for their efforts to win Allah's good pleasure while alive, and they will be well-pleased with it (Surat al-Ghashiya, 9). Allah will respond to their efforts most generously. That was what they were hoping and expecting, and they will be grateful for it and say: \"...

But on the Day of Resurrection, those who do their duty will be over them. Allah provides for whoever He wills without any reckoning. (Surat al-Baqara, 212) As we can see from the verses, the believers who fulfilled their duty to their Lord without seeing Him, who waited for the judgment in apprehension will be under His protection. Another verse that gives the good news of the believers being protected on that Day is the following: ... on the Day when Allah will not disgrace the Prophet and those who believed along with him. Their light will stream out ahead of them and on their right. They will say: \"Our Lord, perfect our light for us and forgive us! You have power over all things.\" (Surat at-Tahrim, 8) Whereas the unbelievers will be debased as never seen before, the believers will know no fear. They will live the joy and pleasure of receiving what Allah has promised them, and will be given their books in their right hands and wait in peace to be directed to Paradise. Allah responded to them with endless rewards, took their lives pleasantly, and protected them from the Day of Reckoning. Allah reveals that He gives blessings and prosperity to the believers in particular, for: Say: \"Who has forbidden the fine clothing Allah has produced for His servants and the good kinds of provision?\" Say: \"On the Day of Resurrection such things will be exclusively for those who believed during their life in this world.\" In this way We make the Signs clear for people who know.

You have done well, so enter it timelessly, forever.\" (Surat az- Zumar, 73) The Qur'an details the rewards that the believers will receive in the eternal life of the Hereafter. One example is given below, as follows: The heedful will be in Gardens of Delight, savoring what their Lord has given them. Their Lord will safeguard them from the punishment of the Blazing Fire: \"Eat and drink with relish for what you did.\" They will recline on couches ranged in rows, and We will marry them to dark-eyed maidens. We will unite those who believed with their offspring, who followed them in faith, and We will not undervalue their own actions in any way. Every man is in pledge for what he earned. We will supply them with any kind of fruit and meat that they desire. They will pass around there a drinking cup to one another with no foolish talk and no wrong action in it. Circulating among them there will be youths like hidden pearls. Some of them will come up to others and they will question one another. They will say: \"Beforehand we used live in fear among our families. But Allah was gracious to us and safeguarded us from the punishment of the searing wind.

On that Day, there will be no mercy or compassion for them, and no power will be able to end their suffering. The main reason for this is that they did not respect Allah's boundaries, even though they were sent re minders, and that they would not have done so even if they were sent back to Earth. This truth is revealed in the following verses: If only you could see when they are standing before the Fire and saying: \"Oh! If only we could be sent back again, we would not deny the Signs of our Lord and we would be among the believers.\" No, it is simply that what they were concealing before has been shown to them; and if they were sent back they would merely return to what they were forbidden to do. Truly they are liars. (Surat al-An‘am, 27-28) While they are accounting for their deeds, the blazing Hell is awaiting them. They will be sent to Hell in return for what they did while alive, for: When the Pages are opened up, when the Heaven is peeled away, when the Fire is set ablaze, when the Garden is brought up close: then each self will know what it has done. (Surat at- Ta kwir, 10-14) Other verses reveal that the believers will have an easy trial: O Man! You are toiling laboriously toward your Lord, but meet Him you will!

Enter among My servants! Enter My Garden.\" (Surat al-Fajr, 27-30) In this way, they will be saved from the eternal Hellfire by His grace and favor and enter Paradise full of endless reward. Their r eply to \"enter Paradise\" is revealed in the Qur'an: They will say: \"Praise be to Allah, Who has fulfilled His promise to us and made us the inheritors of this land, letting us settle in the Garden wherever we want. How excellent is the wage of those who work!\" (Surat az-Zumar, 74) THE UNBELIEVERS ON THE DAY OF JUDGMENT Their Physical State On the Day of Judgment, people will be raised up and re-created. The believers' faces will manifest the light and beauty unique to the faithful, while the unbelievers' faces will be made hideous: We pursued them with a curse in this world, and on the Day of Resurrection they will be hideous and spurned. (Surat al-Qasas, 42) Y et many other verses relate that dust, gloom, and darkness also will cover the unbelievers' faces: That Day some faces will be dust-covered, overcast with gloom.

Those people who forsook an honorable life, one lived according to Allah's will, for one lived according to their selfish desires acquire only debasement. Thus, the resulting ugliness and dishonor is placed upon them. For this reason, they are driven to Hell in shame: If We had wanted to, We would have raised him up by them. But he gravitated toward Earth and pursued his whims and base desires. His metaphor is that of a dog: If you chase it away, it lolls out its tongue and pants, and if you leave it alone, it lolls out its tongue and pants. That is the metaphor of those who deny Our Signs. So tell the story so that hopefully they will reflect. (Surat al-A‘raf, 176) People who allow themselves to be ruled by their selfish desires will be debased in the Hereafter in return for their conceit on Earth. In addition to physical ugliness, they also will be disgraced, for: Some faces that Day will be humiliated. (Surat al-Ghashiya, 2) The unbelievers, who disregarded the verses despite the threat, did not practice them, and would not improve themselves, will experience the astonishment of being debased and helpless at an unexpected moment. They deserve this punishment, and so their situation on that Day will be very difficult. Allah will fulfill His promises, for His rule is just. The verses say: ...

(Surat al-Qamar, 7) The expression in their eyes and their fear-evoking appearance will be given to them on that Day. Allah describes them, as follows: On the Day the Trumpet is blown—and We will gather the evildoers on that Day, blue-eyed [their eyes dimmed by terror and sightless]. (Surah Ta Ha, 102) The Qur'an also reveals that those who were in conceit over Allah's Messengers and verses will be branded on their noses: We will brand him on the snout! (Surat al-Qalam, 16) This is an important source of shame, for calling their noses \"snouts\" and being branded is enough to reveal their debasement and ugliness in the Hereafter. Whereas the believers will live in the Hereafter in comfortable environments, the unbelievers will begin a life of everlasting disgrace. The Qur'an reveals all of this, as follows: [Some] faces that Day will be radiant, gazing at their Lord. And [some] faces that Day will be glowering, realizing that a back- breaking blow has fallen. (Surat al-Qiyama, 22-25) There is no chance of hiding or escaping.

They will confide regret when they see the punishment. Everything will be decided between them justly. They will not be wronged.

(Surah Ibrahim, 22) The believers will watch the unbelievers' hopeless situation, whereas the unbelievers will regard the believers from the corner of their eyes, as their heads will be lowered in shame and remorse. This reality is revealed in one verse: Y ou will see them as they are exposed to it, abject in their abasement, glancing around them furtively. Those who believe will say: \"Truly the losers are those who lose themselves and their families on the Day of Resurrection.\" The wrongdoers are in an everlasting punishment.

Did we turn them into figures of fun? Did our eyes disdain to look at them?\" All this is certainly true—the bickering of the people of the Fire. (Surah Sad, 62-64) While they were alive, their disputes with each other never ended and, in fact, they actually darkened their own lives.

They will receive pain from all sides, as well as dispute continually with those whom they consider close. They Are Disgraced Arrogance toward Allah will bring humiliation. People who do not believe in the Hereafter, deny Allah's evident existence, and live a carefree life will pay a heavy price in return. As they do not consider His punishment probable and so do not think about it, they become Satan's servants by falling for his diversionary tactics and thus waste their lives. Instead of living life as a test, they live it as empty cause. Their arrogance caused them to commit many sins, such as fighting Allah and looking for ways to deny Him. This is no doubt a great sin, one that will lead to great suffering and humiliation in the Hereafter. Obviously, the unbelievers are wrong. They never inquire into the source of Allah's gifts or how they came by their wealth, and consider it their right to enjoy life's pleasures without remembering and giving thanks to their Creator. But the consequences of such arrogance will be massive. The verses reveal: On the Day when those who did not believe are exposed to the Fire [it will be said]: \"You dissipated the good things you had in your worldly life and enjoyed yourself in it. So today you are being repaid with the punishment of humiliation for being arrogant in the land without any right and for being deviators.\" (Surat al-Ahqaf, 20) Those who spend their lives pursuing the world and never re flect upon the Hereafter will be humiliated on the Day of"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"Judgment and after.

(Surat al-Furqan, 69) People who continue their war on Allah with an ugly impudence disregard the Day of Judgment. They live unaware of the plan Allah has devised for them, a plan that is unrivalled. Only small groups of people accepted and then abided by the Messengers' calls. These calls increased other people's unbelief and also increased their burden. In the end, Allah will show the reality of the Hereafter to all people in the most spectacular fashion. And the unbelievers will clearly understand the consequences of Allah's promises. Their lives are not eternal, and their time on Earth has been exhausted. Pleasures and desires have lost their appeal, and the only reality that matters is His judgment. The evil that they did against Allah has been repaid, for He has judged them fit to live forever in suffering and sorrow.

In this way, science confirmed the fact that Allah created the universe and the living things in it. The propaganda carried out today in order to keep the theory of evolution alive is based solely on the distortion of the scientific facts, biased interpretation, and lies and falsehoods disguised as science.

The fact that the theory of evolution is the greatest deception in the history of science has been expressed more and more in the scientific world over the last 20-30 years. Research carried out after the 1980s in particular has revealed that the claims of Darwinism are totally unfounded, something that has been stated by a large number of scientists. In the United States in particular, many scientists from such different fields as biology, biochemistry and paleontology recognize the invalidity of Darwinism and employ the concept of intelligent design to account for the origin of life. This \"intelligent design\" is a scientific expression of the fact that Allah created all living things. We have examined the collapse of the theory of evolution and the proofs of creation in great scientific detail in many of our works, and"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"THE DAY OF JUDGMENT 130 are still continuing to do so. Given the enormous importance of this subject, it will be of great benefit to summarize it here. THE SCIENTIFIC COLLAPSE OF DARWINISM Although this doctrine goes back as far as ancient Greece, the theory of evolution was advanced extensively in the nineteenth century. The most important development that made it the top topic of the world of science was Charles Darwin's The Origin of Species, published in 1859. In this book, he denied that Allah created different living species on Earth separately, for he claimed that all living beings had a common ancestor and had diversified over time through small changes. Darwin's theory was not based on any concrete scientific finding; as he also accepted, it was just an \"assumption.\" Moreover, as Darwin confessed in the long chapter of his book titled \"Difficulties of the Theory,\" the theory failed in the face of many critical questions. Darwin invested all of his hopes in new scientific discoveries, which he expected to solve these difficulties. However, contrary to his expectations, scientific findings expanded the dimensions of these difficulties. The defeat of Darwinism in the face of science can be reviewed under three basic topics: 1) The theory cannot explain how life originated on Earth. 2) No scientific finding shows that the \"evolutionary mechanisms\" proposed by the theory have any evolutionary power at all. 3) The fossil record proves the exact opposite of what the theory suggests. In this section, we will examine these three basic points in general outlines:"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"The Deception of Evolution 131 THE FIRST INSURMOUNTABLE STEP: THE ORIGIN OF LIFE The theory of evolution posits that all living species evolved from a single living cell that emerged on the primitive Earth 3.8 billion years ago. How a single cell could generate millions of complex living species and, if such an evolution really occurred, why traces of it cannot be observed in the fossil record are some of the questions that the theory cannot answer. However, first and foremost, we need to ask: How did this \"first cell\" originate? Since the theory of evolution denies creation and any kind of supernatural intervention, it maintains that the \"first cell\" originated coincidentally within the laws of nature, without any design, plan or arrangement. According to the theory, inanimate matter must have produced a living cell as a result of coincidences. Such a claim, however, is inconsistent with the most unassailable rules of biology. \"LIFE COMES FROM LIFE\" In his book, Darwin never referred to the origin of life. The primitive understanding of science in his time rested on the assumption that living beings had a very simple structure. Since medieval times, spontaneous generation, which asserts that non- living materials came together to form living organisms, had been widely accepted. It was commonly believed that insects came into being from food leftovers, and mice from wheat. Interesting experiments were conducted to prove this theory. Some wheat was placed on a dirty piece of cloth, and it was believed that mice would originate from it after a while. Similarly, maggots developing in rotting meat was assumed to be"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"THE DAY OF JUDGMENT 132 evidence of spontaneous generation. However, it was later understood that worms did not appear on meat spontaneously, but were carried there by flies in the form of larvae, invisible to the naked eye. Even when Darwin wrote The Origin of Species , the belief that bacteria could come into existence from non-living matter was widely accepted in the world of science. However, five years after the publication of Darwin's book, Louis Pasteur announced his results after long studies and experiments, that disproved spontaneous generation, a cornerstone of Darwin's theory. In his triumphal lecture at the Sorbonne in 1864, Pasteur said: \"Never will the doctrine of spontaneous generation recover from the mortal blow struck by this simple experiment.\" 34 For a long time, advocates of the theory of evolution resisted these findings. However, as the development of science unraveled the complex structure of the cell of a living being, the idea that life could come into being coincidentally faced an even greater impasse. INCONCLUSIVE EFFORTS IN THE TWENTIETH CENTURY The first evolutionist who took up the subject of the origin of life in the twentieth century was the renowned Russian biologist Alexander Oparin. With various theses he advanced in the 1930s, he tried to prove that a living cell could originate by coincidence. These studies, however, were doomed to failure, and Oparin had to make the following confession: Unfortunately, however, the problem of the origin of the cell is perhaps the most obscure point in the whole study of the evolution of"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"The Deception of Evolution 133 organisms. 35 Evolutionist followers of Oparin tried to carry out experiments to solve this problem. The best known experiment was carried out by the American chemist Stanley Miller in 1953. Combining the gases he alleged to have existed in the primordial Earth's atmosphere in an experiment set-up, and adding energy to the mixture, Miller synthesized several organic molecules (amino acids) present in the structure of proteins. Barely a few years had passed before it was revealed that this experiment, which was then presented as an important step in the name of evolution, was invalid, for the atmosphere used in the experiment was very different from the real Earth conditions. 36 After a long silence, Miller confessed that the atmosphere medium he used was unrealistic. 37 All the evolutionists' efforts throughout the twentieth century to explain the origin of life ended in failure. The geochemist Jeffrey Bada, from the San Diego Scripps Institute accepts this fact in an article published in Earth magazine in 1998: T oday as we leave the twentieth century, we still face the biggest unsolved problem that we had when we entered the twentieth century: How did life originate on Earth? 38 THE COMPLEX STRUCTURE OF LIFE The primary reason why the theory of evolution ended up in such a great impasse regarding the origin of life is that even those living organisms deemed to be the simplest have incredibly complex structures. The cell of a living thing is more complex than"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"THE DAY OF JUDGMENT 134 all of our man-made technological products. Today, even in the most developed laboratories of the world, a living cell cannot be produced by bringing organic chemicals together. The conditions required for the formation of a cell are too great in quantity to be explained away by coincidences. The probability of proteins, the building blocks of a cell, being synthesized coincidentally, is 1 in 10 950 for an average protein made up of 500 amino acids. In mathematics, a probability smaller than 1 over 10 50 is considered to be impossible in practical terms. The DNA molecule, which is located in the nucleus of a cell and which stores genetic information, is an incredible databank. If the information coded in DNA were written down, it would make a giant library consisting of an estimated 900 volumes of encyclopedias consisting of 500 pages each. A very interesting dilemma emerges at this point: DNA can r eplicate itself only with the help of some specialized proteins (enzymes). However, the synthesis of these enzymes can be realized only by the information coded in DNA. As they both depend on each other, they have to exist at the same time for replication. This brings the scenario that life originated by itself to a deadlock. Prof. Leslie Orgel, an evolutionist of repute from the University of San Diego, California, confesses this fact in the September 1994 issue of the Scientific American magazine: It is extremely improbable that proteins and nucleic acids, both of which are structurally complex, arose spontaneously in the same place at the same time. Yet it also seems impossible to have one without the other. And so, at first glance, one might have to conclude that life could never, in fact, have originated by chemical means. 39 No doubt, if it is impossible for life to have originated from natural causes, then it has to be accepted that life was \"created\" in a"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"The Deception of Evolution 135 supernatural way. This fact explicitly invalidates the theory of evolution, whose main purpose is to deny creation. IMAGINARY MECHANISM OF EVOLUTION The second important point that negates Darwin's theory is that both concepts put forward by the theory as \"evolutionary mechanisms\" were understood to have, in reality, no evolutionary power. Darwin based his evolution allegation entirely on the mechanism of \"natural selection.\" The importance he placed on this mechanism was evident in the name of his book: The Origin of Species, By Means of Natural Selection... Natural selection holds that those living things that are stronger and more suited to the natural conditions of their habitats will survive in the struggle for life. For example, in a deer herd under the threat of attack by wild animals, those that can run faster will survive. Therefore, the deer herd will be comprised of faster and stronger individuals. However, unquestionably, this mechanism will not cause deer to evolve and transform themselves into another living species, for instance, horses. Therefore, the mechanism of natural selection has no evolutionary power. Darwin was also aware of this fact and had to state this in his book The Origin of Species : Natural selection can do nothing until favourable individual differences or variations occur. 40"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"THE DAY OF JUDGMENT 136 LAMARCK'S IMPACT So, how could these \"favorable variations\" occur? Darwin tried to answer this question from the standpoint of the primitive understanding of science at that time. According to the French biologist Chevalier de Lamarck (1744-1829), who lived before Darwin, living creatures passed on the traits they acquired during their lifetime to the next generation. He asserted that these traits, which accumulated from one generation to another, caused new species to be formed. For instance, he claimed that giraffes evolved from antelopes; as they struggled to eat the leaves of high trees, their necks were extended from generation to generation. Darwin also gave similar examples. In his book The Origin of Species, for instance, he said that some bears going into water to find food transformed themselves into whales over time. 41 However, the laws of inheritance discovered by Gregor Mendel (1822-84) and verified by the science of genetics, which flourished in the twentieth century, utterly demolished the legend that acquired traits were passed on to subsequent generations. Thus, natural selection fell out of favor as an evolutionary mechanism. NEO-DARWINISM AND MUTATIONS In order to find a solution, Darwinists advanced the \"Modern Synthetic Theory,\" or as it is more commonly known, Neo- Darwinism, at the end of the 1930's. Neo-Darwinism added mutations, which are distortions formed in the genes of living beings due to such external factors as radiation or replication errors, as the \"cause of favorable variations\" in addition to natural mutation."},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"The Deception of Evolution 137 To day, the model that stands for evolution in the world is Neo- Darwinism. The theory maintains that millions of living beings formed as a result of a process whereby numerous complex organs of these organisms (e.g., ears, eyes, lungs, and wings) underwent \"mutations,\" that is, genetic disorders. Yet, there is an outright scientific fact that totally undermines this theory: Mutations do not cause living beings to develop; on the contrary, they are always harmful. The reason for this is very simple: DNA has a very complex structure, and random effects can only harm it. The American geneticist B.G. Ranganathan explains this as follows: First, genuine mutations are very rare in nature. Secondly, most mutations are harmful since they are random, rather than orderly changes in the structure of genes; any random change in a highly ordered system will be for the worse, not for the better. For example, if an earthquake were to shake a highly ordered structure such as a building, there would be a random change in the framework of the building which, in all probability, would not be an improvement. 42 Not surprisingly, no mutation example, which is useful, that is, which is observed to develop the genetic code, has been observed so far. All mutations have proved to be harmful. It was understood that mutation, which is presented as an \"evolutionary mechanism,\" is actually a genetic occurrence that harms living things, and leaves them disabled. (The most common effect of mutation on human beings is cancer.) Of course, a destructive mechanism cannot be an \"evolutionary mechanism.\" Natural selection, on the other hand, \"can do nothing by itself,\" as Darwin also accepted. This fact shows us that there is no \"evolutionary mechanism\" in nature. Since no evolutionary mechanism exists, no such any imaginary process called \"evolution\" could have taken place."},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"THE DAY OF JUDGMENT 138 THE FOSSIL RECORD: NO SIGN OF INTERMEDIATE FORMS The clearest evidence that the scenario suggested by the theory of evolution did not take place is the fossil record. According to this theory, every living species has sprung from a predecessor. A previously existing species turned into something else over time and all species have come into being in this way. In other words, this transformation proceeds gradually over millions of years. Had this been the case, numerous intermediary species should have existed and lived within this long transformation period. For instance, some half-fish/half-reptiles should have lived in the past which had acquired some reptilian traits in addition to the fish traits they already had. Or there should have existed some r eptile-birds, which acquired some bird traits in addition to the r eptilian traits they already had. Since these would be in a transitional phase, they should be disabled, defective, crippled living beings. Evolutionists refer to these imaginary creatures, which they believe to have lived in the past, as \" transitional forms .\" If such animals ever really existed, there should be millions and even billions of them in number and variety. More importantly, the re mains of these strange creatures should be present in the fossil r ecord. In The Origin of Species , Darwin explained: If my theory be true, numberless intermediate varieties, linking most closely all of the species of the same group together must assuredly have existed... Consequently, evidence of their former existence could be found only amongst fossil remains. 43"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"The Deception of Evolution 139 DARWIN'S HOPES SHATTERED However, although evolutionists have been making strenuous efforts to find fossils since the middle of the nineteenth century all over the world, no transitional forms have yet been uncovered. All of the fossils, contrary to the evolutionists' expectations, show that life appeared on Earth all of a sudden and fully-formed. One famous British paleontologist, Derek V. Ager, admits this fact, even though he is an evolutionist: The point emerges that if we examine the fossil record in detail, whether at the level of orders or of species, we find—over and over again—not gradual evolution, but the sudden explosion of one group at the expense of another. 44 This means that in the fossil record, all living species suddenly emerge as fully formed, without any intermediate forms in between. This is just the opposite of Darwin's assumptions. Also, this is very strong evidence that all living things are created. The only explanation of a living species emerging suddenly and complete in every detail without any evolutionary ancestor is that it was created. This fact is admitted also by the widely known evolutionist biologist Douglas Futuyma: Creation and evolution, between them, exhaust the possible explanations for the origin of living things. Organisms either appeared on the earth fully developed or they did not. If they did not, they must have developed from pre-existing species by some process of modification. If they did appear in a fully developed state, they must indeed have been created by some omnipotent intelligence. 45 Fossils show that living beings emerged fully developed and in a perfect state on the Earth. That means that \"the origin of species,\" contrary to Darwin's supposition, is not evolution, but creation."},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"THE DAY OF JUDGMENT 140 THE TALE OF HUMAN EVOLUTION The subject most often brought up by advocates of the theory of evolution is the subject of the origin of man. The Darwinist claim holds that modern man evolved from ape-like creatures. During this alleged evolutionary process, which is supposed to have started 4-5 million years ago, some \"transitional forms\" between modern man and his ancestors are supposed to have existed. According to this completely imaginary scenario, four basic \"categories\" are listed: 1. Australopithecus 2. Homo habilis 3. Homo erectus 4. Homo sapiens Evolutionists call man's so-called first ape-like ancestors Australopithecus, which means \"South African ape.\" These living beings are actually nothing but an old ape species that has become extinct. Extensive research done on various Australopithecus specimens by two world famous anatomists from England and the USA, namely, Lord Solly Zuckerman and Prof. Charles Oxnard, shows that these apes belonged to an ordinary ape species that became extinct and bore no resemblance to humans. 46 Evolutionists classify the next stage of human evolution as \"homo,\" that is \"man.\" According to their claim, the living beings in the Homo series are more developed than Australopithecus. Evolutionists devise a fanciful evolution scheme by arranging different fossils of these creatures in a particular order. This scheme is imaginary because it has never been proved that there is an evolutionary relation between these different classes. Ernst Mayr, one of the twentieth century's most important evolutionists, contends in his book One Long Argument that \"particularly"},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"The Deception of Evolution 141 historical [puzzles] such as the origin of life or of Homo sapiens, are extremely difficult and may even resist a final, satisfying explanation.\" 47 By outlining the link chain as Australopithecus > Homo habilis > Homo erectus > Homo sapiens, evolutionists imply that each of these species is one another's ancestor. However, recent findings of paleoanthropologists have revealed that Australopithecus, Homo habilis, and Homo erectus lived at different parts of the world at the same time. 48 Moreover, a certain segment of humans classified as Homo erectus have lived up until very modern times. Homo sapiens neandarthalensis and Homo sapiens sapiens (modern man) co-existed in the same region. 49 This situation apparently indicates the invalidity of the claim that they are ancestors of one another. A paleontologist from Harvard University, Stephen Jay Gould, explains this deadlock of the theory of evolution, although he is an evolutionist himself: What has become of our ladder if there are three coexisting lineages of hominids (A. africanus, the robust australopithecines, and H. habilis), none clearly derived from another? Moreover, none of the three display any evolutionary trends during their tenure on earth. 50 Put briefly, the scenario of human evolution, which is \"upheld\" with the help of various drawings of some \"half ape, half human\" creatures appearing in the media and course books, that is, frankly, by means of propaganda, is nothing but a tale with no scientific foundation. Lord Solly Zuckerman, one of the most famous and respected scientists in the U.K., who carried out research on this subject for years and studied Australopithecus fossils for 15 years, finally concluded, despite being an evolutionist himself, that there is, in"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"THE DAY OF JUDGMENT 142 fact, no such family tree branching out from ape-like creatures to man. Zuckerman also made an interesting \"spectrum of science\" ranging from those he considered scientific to those he considered unscientific. According to Zuckerman's spectrum, the most \"scientific\"—that is, depending on concrete data—fields of science are chemistry and physics. After them come the biological sciences and then the social sciences. At the far end of the spectrum, which is the part considered to be most \"unscientific,\" are \"extra-sensory perception\"—concepts such as telepathy and sixth sense—and finally \"human evolution.\" Zuckerman explains his reasoning: We then move right off the register of objective truth into those fields of presumed biological science, like extrasensory perception or the interpretation of man's fossil history, where to the faithful [evolutionist] anything is possible—and where the ardent believer [in evolution] is sometimes able to believe several contradictory things at the same time. 51 The tale of human evolution boils down to nothing but the prejudiced interpretations of some fossils unearthed by certain people, who blindly adhere to their theory. DARWINIAN FORMULA! Besides all the technical evidence we have dealt with so far, let us now for once, examine what kind of a superstition the evolutionists have with an example so simple as to be understood even by children: The theory of evolution asserts that life is formed by chance. According to this claim, lifeless and unconscious atoms came"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"The Deception of Evolution 143 together to form the cell and then they somehow formed other living things, including man. Let us think about that. When we bring together the elements that are the building-blocks of life such as carbon, phosphorus, nitrogen and potassium, only a heap is formed. No matter what treatments it undergoes, this atomic heap cannot form even a single living being. If you like, let us formulate an \"experiment\" on this subject and let us examine on the behalf of evolutionists what they really claim without pronouncing loudly under the name \"Darwinian formula\": Let evolutionists put plenty of materials present in the composition of living things such as phosphorus, nitrogen, carbon, oxygen, iron, and magnesium into big barrels. Moreover, let them add in these barrels any material that does not exist under normal conditions, but they think as necessary. Let them add in this mixture as many amino acids—which have no possibility of forming under natural conditions—and as many proteins—a single one of which has a formation probability of 10 - 950 —as they like. Let them expose these mixtures to as much heat and moisture as they like. Let them stir these with whatever technologically developed device they like. Let them put the foremost scientists beside these barrels. Let these experts wait in turn beside these barrels for billions, and even trillions of years. Let them be free to use all kinds of conditions they believe to be necessary for a human's formation. No matter what they do, they cannot produce from these barrels a human, say a professor that examines his cell structure under the electron microscope. They cannot produce giraffes, lions, bees, canaries, horses, dolphins, roses, orchids, lilies, carnations, bananas, oranges, apples, dates, tomatoes, melons, watermelons, figs, olives, grapes, peaches, peafowls, pheasants, multicoloured butterflies, or millions of other living beings such as these. Indeed, they could not obtain"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"THE DAY OF JUDGMENT 144 even a single cell of any one of them. Briefly, unconscious atoms cannot form the cell by coming together. They cannot take a new decision and divide this cell into two, then take other decisions and create the professors who first invent the electron microscope and then examine their own cell structure under that microscope. Matter is an unconscious, lifeless heap, and it comes to life with Allah's superior creation. The theory of evolution, which claims the opposite, is a total fallacy completely contrary to reason. Thinking even a little bit on the claims of tevolutionists discloses this reality, just as in the above example. TECHNOLOGY IN THE EYE AND THE EAR Another subject that remains unanswered by evolutionary theory is the excellent quality of perception in the eye and the ear. Before passing on to the subject of the eye, let us briefly answer the question of how we see. Light rays coming from an object fall oppositely on the eye's retina. Here, these light rays are transmitted into electric signals by cells and reach a tiny spot at the back of the brain, the \"center of vision.\" These electric signals are perceived in this center as an image after a series of processes. With this technical background, let us do some thinking. The brain is insulated from light. That means that its inside is completely dark, and that no light reaches the place where it is located. Thus, the \"center of vision\" is never touched by light and may even be the darkest place you have ever known. However, you observe a luminous, bright world in this pitch darkness. The image formed in the eye is so sharp and distinct that even the technology of the twentieth century has not been able to attain it."},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"The Deception of Evolution 145 For instance, look at the book you are reading, your hands with which you are holding it, and then lift your head and look around you. Have you ever seen such a sharp and distinct image as this one at any other place? Even the most developed television screen produced by the greatest television producer in the world cannot provide such a sharp image for you. This is a three-dimensional, colored, and extremely sharp image. For more than 100 years, thousands of engineers have been trying to achieve this sharpness. Factories, huge premises were established, much research has been done, plans and designs have been made for this purpose. Again, look at a TV screen and the book you hold in your hands. You will see that there is a big difference in sharpness and distinction. Moreover, the TV screen shows you a two-dimensional image, whereas with your eyes, you watch a three-dimensional perspective with depth. For many years, tens of thousands of engineers have tried to make a three-dimensional TV and achieve the vision quality of the eye. Yes, they have made a three-dimensional television system, but it is not possible to watch it without putting on special 3-D glasses; moreover, it is only an artificial three-dimension. The background is more blurred, the foreground appears like a paper setting. Never has it been possible to produce a sharp and distinct vision like that of the eye. In both the camera and the television, there is a loss of image quality. Evolutionists claim that the mechanism producing this sharp and distinct image has been formed by chance. Now, if somebody told you that the television in your room was formed as a result of chance, that all of its atoms just happened to come together and make up this device that produces an image, what would you think? How can atoms do what thousands of people cannot?"},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"THE DAY OF JUDGMENT 146 If a device producing a more primitive image than the eye could not have been formed by chance, then it is very evident that the eye and the image seen by the eye could not have been formed by chance. The same situation applies to the ear. The outer ear picks up the available sounds by the auricle and directs them to the middle ear, the middle ear transmits the sound vibrations by intensifying them, and the inner ear sends these vibrations to the brain by translating them into electric signals. Just as with the eye, the act of hearing finalizes in the center of hearing in the brain. The situation in the eye is also true for the ear. That is, the brain is insulated from sound just as it is from light. It does not let any sound in. Therefore, no matter how noisy is the outside, the inside of the brain is completely silent. Nevertheless, the sharpest sounds are perceived in the brain. In your completely silent brain, you listen to symphonies, and hear all of the noises in a crowded place. However, were the sound level in your brain was measured by a precise device at that moment, complete silence would be found to be prevailing there. As is the case with imagery, decades of effort have been spent in trying to generate and reproduce sound that is faithful to the original. The results of these efforts are sound recorders, high- fidelity systems, and systems for sensing sound. Despite all of this technology and the thousands of engineers and experts who have been working on this endeavor, no sound has yet been obtained that has the same sharpness and clarity as the sound perceived by the ear. Think of the highest-quality hi-fi systems produced by the largest company in the music industry. Even in these devices, when sound is recorded some of it is lost; or when you turn on a hi-fi you always hear a hissing sound before the music starts. However, the sounds that are the products of the human body's technology are"},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"The Deception of Evolution 147 extremely sharp and clear. A human ear never perceives a sound accompanied by a hissing sound or with atmospherics as does a hi- fi; rather, it perceives sound exactly as it is, sharp and clear. This is the way it has been since the creation of man. So far, no man-made visual or recording apparatus has been as sensitive and successful in perceiving sensory data as are the eye and the ear. However, as far as seeing and hearing are concerned, a far greater truth lies beyond all this. TO WHOM DOES THE CONSCIOUSNESS THAT SEES AND HEARS WITHIN THE BRAIN BELONG? Who watches an alluring world in the brain, listens to symphonies and the twittering of birds, and smells the rose? The stimulations coming from a person's eyes, ears, and nose travel to the brain as electro-chemical nerve impulses. In biology, physiology, and biochemistry books, you can find many details about how this image forms in the brain. However, you will never come across the most important fact: Who perceives these electro- chemical nerve impulses as images, sounds, odors, and sensory events in the brain? There is a consciousness in the brain that perceives all this without feeling any need for an eye, an ear, and a nose. To whom does this consciousness belong? Of course it does not belong to the nerves, the fat layer, and neurons comprising the brain. This is why Darwinist-materialists, who believe that everything is comprised of matter, cannot answer these questions. For this consciousness is the spirit created by Allah, which needs neither the eye to watch the images nor the ear to hear the sounds. Furthermore, it does not need the brain to think. Everyone who reads this explicit and scientific fact should"},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"THE DAY OF JUDGMENT 148 ponder on Almighty Allah, and fear and seek refuge in Him, for He squeezes the entire universe in a pitch-dark place of a few cubic centimeters in a three-dimensional, colored, shadowy, and luminous form. AM A TERIALIST FAITH The information we have presented so far shows us that the theory of evolution is a incompatible with scientific findings. The theory's claim regarding the origin of life is inconsistent with science, the evolutionary mechanisms it proposes have no evolutionary power, and fossils demonstrate that the required intermediate forms have never existed. So, it certainly follows that the theory of evolution should be pushed aside as an unscientific idea. This is how many ideas, such as the Earth-centered universe model, have been taken out of the agenda of science throughout history. However, the theory of evolution is kept on the agenda of science. Some people even try to represent criticisms directed against it as an \"attack on science.\" Why? The reason is that this theory is an indispensable dogmatic belief for some circles. These circles are blindly devoted to materialist philosophy and adopt Darwinism because it is the only materialist explanation that can be put forward to explain the workings of nature. Interestingly enough, they also confess this fact from time to time. A well-known geneticist and an outspoken evolutionist, Richard C. Lewontin from Harvard University, confesses that he is \"first and foremost a materialist and then a scientist\":"},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"The Deception of Evolution 149 It is not that the methods and institutions of science somehow compel us accept a material explanation of the phenomenal world, but, on the contrary, that we are forced by our a priori adherence to material causes to create an apparatus of investigation and a set of concepts that produce material explanations, no matter how counter-intuitive, no matter how mystifying to the uninitiated. Moreover, that materialism is absolute, so we cannot allow a Divine Foot in the door. 52 These are explicit statements that Darwinism is a dogma kept alive just for the sake of adherence to materialism. This dogma maintains that there is no being save matter. Therefore, it argues that inanimate, unconscious matter created life. It insists that millions of different living species (e.g., birds, fish, giraffes, tigers, insects, trees, flowers, whales, and human beings) originated as a result of the interactions between matter such as pouring rain, lightning flashes, and so on, out of inanimate matter. This is a precept contrary both to r eason and science. Yet Darwinists continue to defend it just so as \"not to allow a Divine Foot in the door.\" Anyone who does not look at the origin of living beings with a materialist prejudice will see this evident truth: All living beings are works of a Creator, Who is All-Powerful, All-Wise, and All- Knowing. This Creator is Allah, Who created the whole universe from non-existence, designed it in the most perfect form, and fashioned all living beings. THE THEORY OF EVOLUTION IS THE MOST POTENT SPELL IN THE WORLD Anyone free of prejudice and the influence of any particular ideology, who uses only his or her reason and logic, will clearly"},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"THE DAY OF JUDGMENT 150 understand that belief in the theory of evolution, which brings to mind the superstitions of societies with no knowledge of science or civilization, is quite impossible. As explained above, those who believe in the theory of evolution think that a few atoms and molecules thrown into a huge vat could produce thinking, reasoning professors and university students; such scientists as Einstein and Galileo; such artists as Humphrey Bogart, Frank Sinatra and Luciano Pavarotti; as well as antelopes, lemon trees, and carnations. Moreover, as the scientists and professors who believe in this nonsense are educated people, it is quite justifiable to speak of this theory as \"the most potent spell in history.\" Never before has any other belief or idea so taken away peoples' powers of reason, refused to allow them to think intelligently and logically and hidden the truth from them as if they had been blindfolded. This is an even worse and unbelievable blindness than the Egyptians worshipping the Sun God Ra, totem worship in some parts of Africa, the people of Saba worshipping the Sun, the tribe of Prophet Ibrahim (peace be upon him) worshipping idols they had made with their own hands, or the people of the Prophet Musa (peace be upon him) worshipping the Golden Calf. In fact, Allah has pointed to this lack of reason in the Qur'an. In many verse, He reveals in many verses that some peoples' minds will be closed and that they will be powerless to see the truth. Some of these verses are as follows: As for those who do not believe, it makes no difference to them whether you warn them or do not warn them, they will not believe. Allah has sealed up their hearts and hearing and over their eyes is a blindfold. They will have a terrible punishment. (Surat al-Baqara: 6-7) ... They have hearts with which they do not understand. They"},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"The Deception of Evolution 151 have eyes with which they do not see. They have ears with which they do not hear. Such people are like cattle. No, they are even further astray! They are the unaware. (Surat al-A‘raf: 179) Even if We opened up to them a door into heaven, and they spent the day ascending through it, they would only say: \"Our eyesight is befuddled! Or rather we have been put under a spell!\" (Surat al-Hijr: 14-15) Wo r ds cannot express just how astonishing it is that this spell should hold such a wide community in thrall, keep people from the truth, and not be broken for 150 years. It is understandable that one or a few people might believe in impossible scenarios and claims full of stupidity and illogicality. However, \"magic\" is the only possible explanation for people from all over the world believing that unconscious and lifeless atoms suddenly decided to come together and form a universe that functions with a flawless system of organization, discipline, reason, and consciousness; a planet named Earth with all of its features so perfectly suited to life; and living things full of countless complex systems. In fact, the Qur'an relates the incident of Prophet Musa and Pharaoh to show that some people who support atheistic philosophies actually influence others by magic. When Pharaoh was told about the true religion, he told Prophet Musa to meet with his own magicians. When Musa did so, he told them to demonstrate their abilities first. The verses continue: He said: \"You throw.\" And when they threw, they cast a spell on the people's eyes and caused them to feel great fear of them. They produced an extremely powerful magic. (Surat al-A‘raf: 1 16) As we have seen, Pharaoh's magicians were able to deceive everyone, apart from Musa and those who believed in him."},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"THE DAY OF JUDGMENT 152 However, his evidence broke the spell, or \"swallowed up what they had forged,\" as the verse puts it. We revealed to Musa, \"Throw down your staff.\" And it immediately swallowed up what they had forged. So the Truth took place and what they did was shown to be false. (Surat al- A‘raf: 117-118) As we can see, when people realized that a spell had been cast upon them and that what they saw was just an illusion, Pharaoh's magicians lost all credibility. In the present day too, unless those who, under the influence of a similar spell, believe in these ridiculous claims under their scientific disguise and spend their lives defending them, abandon their superstitious beliefs, they also will be humiliated when the full truth emerges and the spell is broken. In fact, Malcolm Muggeridge, an atheist philosopher and supporter of evolution, admitted he was worried by just that prospect: I myself am convinced that the theory of evolution, especially the extent to which it's been applied, will be one of the great jokes in the history books in the future. Posterity will marvel that so very flimsy and dubious an hypothesis could be accepted with the incredible credulity that it has. 53 That future is not far off: On the contrary, people will soon see that \"chance\" is not a deity, and will look back on the theory of evolution as the worst deceit and the most terrible spell in the world. That spell is already rapidly beginning to be lifted from the shoulders of people all over the world. Many people who see its true face are wondering with amazement how they could ever have been taken in by it. They said, \"Glory be to You! We have no knowledge except what You have taught us. Y ou are the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.\" (Surat al-Baqara: 32)"},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"NOTES 1 D.J.
