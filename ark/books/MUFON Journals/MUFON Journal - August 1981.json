FROM THE EDITOR We present in this issue still another interpretation of abduction reports, this time as psychological imagery. The ferment of thought on abduction cases is a healthy sign. The author's idea is interesting and deserves to be studied, though its application to some cases (e.g., Travis Walton, with independent witnesses to a UFO, and others with physical evidence effects) would seem to be strained. Still, it may have application • to some of the cases and therefore warrants discussion rather than outrof-hand rejection. As with- some other recent \"theories,\" the author may be stretching it too far. However, the im- agery phenomena described do bear sufficient resemblance to some aspects of close encounter cases to suggest that the notion deserves critical review.

Aircraft, weather balloons, clouds, the moon, the sun, stars, planets, and meteors have all been the cause of reports from people caught either by something which they haven't pre- viously observed or by an unex- pected or unusual aspect of viewing. Ground markings reportedly asso- ciated with UFOs have been caused by fungus, slime mould, leaf smut, animals, whirlwinds, helicopters and hoaxes. Even photographs have fallen to the use of sophisticated computer technology which has now eliminated all but a few of the more than 1,000 photographs known to have been in- vestigated since 1947. Radar \"evidence\" has been con- fused by the lack of understanding that even in this medium the human element of interpretation still comes into play and that other cases can be eliminated by the words \"anomalous propagation.\" The January 1979 New Zealand radar reports in association with two movie films represents the point in question. The New Zealand government declared the radar targets to be due to faulty equipment and anomalous propagation effects. The second film was said to be Venus and doubt was cast on the initial film as being of little scientific value. (This in- terpretation, of course, is strongly disputed by Dr. Bruce S. Maccabee. -Ed.) The residue left after the above ex- planations have been taken into ac- count are a few photographs which have passed computer analysis, a small group of physical trace cases, and a larger number of close en- counters where verbal testimony is the only evidence available. It is this latter group of reports which will be the subject of this paper. The following examples of reported encounters will illustrate the typical event under consideration. Gum Creek, South Australia (1964) A farmer's wife lying awake at 0200 hrs. (CST) 1 noticed a \"figure\" suddenly appear outside the bedroom window, as if a \"movie screen had been unrolled.\" The scene seemed very bright as if daylight and the en- tity was revealed in great detail because of the unusual lighting. The male figure appeared to be taking \"photographs,\" then advanced towards the window. The lady wanted to speak to the figure but found she couldn't. She slipped down into bed and fell asleep. It was con- jectured by her that the lighting came from an object above the house. No traces were found. Sandford, Tasmania (1978) Awakening due to a dog barking, a woman rose at 2350 hrs. (EST) 2 and looked out of the window. She no- ticed a \"doorway\" of white light out on the rough, front driveway. It was dark everywhere else surrounding the \"door.\" However through and only through the \"door\" she could see the drive as if it were lit up by daylight. Then a golden glow spread from the door and both went out in- stantly. No traces found. Boyup Brook, West Australia (196 7) A man was driving alone at 2130 hrs. (WST), 3 doing a steady 100 kph. Suddenly he became aware of the ap- proach of a lighted object from the air. The car was immediately \"stopped dead\" and all electrical systems ceased to function. There was no feeling of deceleration at all. Look- ing up he reported seeing an irrides- cent blue oval over the car with a tube of light extending down into the car. After an estimated five minutes the object left and he found himself travelling along at 100 kph again with all systems working and no feeling of acceleration. His watch was later reportedly found to be 5 minutes slow. Prospect, III., USA (1977) At 0100 hrs. (local) while driving alone a 19-year-old man claimed he was abducted from his car and taken into an object where weird entities were observed. He was then returned to his vehicle and found himself still travelling at speed. An inspection of a large (300) sam- ple of such close encounters within Australia lead to the conclusion that most are reported to occur in rural or isolated localities, at night, mainly with only one person present, fre- quently when they are driving a vehi- cle. There are peaks in the times of reports, namely 2000-2200 hrs. and 0200-0400 hrs. (see diagram l). The type of object reported varies tremen- dously, and in some cases a humanoid \"figure\" is described in association with the UFO. There are physically inexplicable events described such as \"materialization,\" cars being \"taken over\" from the drivers' control, and abduction stories of medical examina- tion. In attempting to determine if there was a real event without resort to the extraterrestrial hypothesis or other more fanciful theories, two cases caught my attention. Details follow. Ivy Tanks, South Australia (1973) A lady was travelling as a passen- ger in a semi-trailer and decided to go to sleep at 0200 hrs. 1 About 0300 hrs. she heard a warm male voice calling her name and telling her to look out of the window. By the side of the road she saw an egg-shaped object surrounded by a \"force field.\" The en- tire thing was alight with a white glow which seemed to come from all (continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Imagery, Continued over and inside it. She feels the oval may have been semi-transparent. This illumination was so good that she was at a loss to compare the color and glow to anything she could think of. Although the viewing time was short (5 seconds) much detail was noted. The \"force field\" glow died down in an inexplicable manner. She woke up feeling fresh and upon questioning the driver found he had said and seen nothing. Frankston, Victoria (1972) While driving home, a 37-year-old housewife encountered a large silver- blue irridescent object hovering over her car. Twenty-two days later a similar or the'same object appeared over her car at the same location. Sud- denly the car's engine cut off and couldn't be restarted. She tried the steering wheel, pumped the brake and changed gear, all to no avail. The car \"controlled itself\" to the side of the road and stopped. All sound was drained out of the air and she was told three things. The engine then started itself and she drove to a police station and reported the incident. Later a mental message told her to return to the spot. On the way a man \"material- ized\" then later \"dematerialized\" in- side her car. Meeting two other peo- ple at the spot she again saw this \"man\" then lapsed into unconscious- ness and while physically in the presence of two people who saw none of this, she described being taken inside a \"room.\" There was no visible sign of illumination yet the room was well lit. She then recovered in the car. Other odd psychic events occurred at around this time (e.g., voices in her head). She was regarded as an average, normal healthy person by those who knew her. As will be noted from these two reports there are items which we would consider impossible. Cars do not take over control of themselves and materialization is not an everyday practice. Remember, though, we are not talking of cranks or crackpots here, we are speaking of credible, reliable, healthy, average persons who stood up to rigorous cross- examination. These events are single or at most multiple over a period of 6 months in an entire lifetime, not con- stantly repeated unlike so-called \"con- tactee\" claims. A court would have no doubt about the status of these people as reliable witnesses. A literature search revealed that there are known psychological phenomena which are still not fully understood (as far as a mechanism goes) which seem to provide a possi- ble examination for these events. These are hypnopompic and hyp- nagogic imagery. 4 Hypnopompic imagery was so named by Alfred Maury in 1848. Maury perceived \"faces\" in the dark. Both types of imagery most often oc- cur with the eyes closed, but may also occur in a darkened environment with the eyes open. McKellar (1972) reports encountering individuals who reported remarkably similar imagery which occurred when they were fully awake. The imagery content is visual, or auditory, in the main but also include sensation of heat/cold, smell, or touch. They may be reproductions of the events of the day or strange, bizarre images of pleasing or frighten- ing proportions. There seems to be lit- tle control over their appearance, and thus a person could certainly be frightened by their sudden onset. Reality and images of this kind can be readily confused. One of the most basic auditory images is that of hear- ing one's name called. You may recall instances where sleeping or dozing waiting for a morning call to break- fast, you hear your name called and obediently trot into the kitchen only to find a half-cooked breakfast and a puzzled chef. Visual images range from simple (patches of color) to integrated and complex scenes. Objects can be \"strange\" or noticed from an unusual angle with sometimes an unusual clarity of detail. Durations range from seconds to minutes. Persons exper- iencing these images comment on the unusual intensity of color and lights using such phrases as \"strange luminosity\" and \"glow of the Sun.\" Surveys which have been done have led to speculation that such im- agery is experienced by all but denied by some as some deny having dreams. The incidence of imagery amongst the population has been found to range from 50-70% with events occurring to a number either nightly or regularly experienced on at least half the nights. As an example of just how \"real\" these images can be, an instance quoted by McKellar (1968) is of note. A young couple had a routine of the wife getting breakfast ready for her husband and then seeing him off to work. One morning she recalled get- ting out of bed, washing, dressing, getting breakfast, and then kissing her husband goodby. At this point she \"woke\" to find her husband kissing her goodby. She had been asleep in bed all the time until that point. Green and McCreery (1975) re- lated what they called type two awakenings where we find people awakening normally to find them- selves in bed. The surroundings at first appear normal but then become unusual or uncanny. Alternatively they may awake immediately to a stressed or stormy feeling. In either case they may experience fear, panic, or an hallucination or apparitional ef- fect. This may also be accompanied by a seeming paralysis of the body or an \"out of body\" state. To an outside observer the person would appear asleep, lying with eyes closed. Occasionally type two false awakenings are simply the sensation of awakening, then really awakening. ' Table 1 compares characteristics of UFO events and imagery. I would suggest that events such as Ivy Tanks (1973), Gum Creek (1964), and Sandford (1978) are imagery caused as they occurred on the awake/asleep interface where we know imagery occurs. The accounts of the Boyup Brook (1967), Prospect (1977) and Frankston (1972) cases contain the same basic elements and occurred to persons travelling alone in an environment of unrelieved nature, driving along a relatively isolated road where one would have the probability of being in relaxed wakefulness on the sleep/- awake interface. (continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Imagery, Continued There are hundreds of such events described in the UFO literature which the \"image\" hypothesis appears to be able to satisfactorily explain. About 100 cases exist on record where people claim to have been \"ab- ducted\" by aliens and subjected to a medical examination on board a UFO. An in-depth examination of 25 cases indicated strong correlation with the types of event already discussed. There are the same basic details present, except these abduc- tion events result in a more convinced reporter with seeming physiological and physical traces, (e.g., glazed eyes, needle puncture marks). However, many cases occur where the witnesses claim to have been awakened from sleep or travelling in a vehicle where image conditions are optimum. One abduction case (Calgary, Canada 1967) presents a further pointer to this hypothesis being cred- ible. A boy on a 3-minute walk be- tween two houses along a paddock arrived home in a daze. Under hyp- nosis he revealed he heard a high- pitched noise, looked up and saw an object. He was taken up into it and medically examined. However, the hypnotist believed that the incident was actually a subconscious memory recall of an earlier appendectomy operation. Physiological and physical occur- rences in people might have a parallel with the medically recognized \"hysterical conversion.\" Hysteria is recognized as an illness resulting from emotional conflict and is classically manifested by dramatic physical symptoms involving the voluntary muscles or the organ of special senses. During the process of conversion un- conscious impulses are transmitted in- to bodily symptoms. The emotional conflict is expressed physically (e.g., facial swelling, tunnel vision, or shock). Mechanism Although we accept imagery as oc- curring we are still not certain of its mechanism. EEC experiments reveal that creative imagery is connected with the Theta brain wave pattern and that excess theta may be evident in schizophrenics and psycho- neurotics. Victims of the former can withdraw into fantasies and hallucina- tions. Much more investigation needs to be performed and it would be premature to speculate on the possi- ble mechanism here beyond reporting that Ferguson (1973) describes how William Dent and associates of Stan- ford University looked at neural discharges — PGO (pont ine- geniculo-occipital) spikes — which oc- cur most heavily (but not exclusively) during paradoxical sleep. These bursts are thought possibly to bring on the intense visual imagery associated with REM (rapid eye movement) sleep. If abnormal discharges of this kind occur to normal, healthy people at other than REM sleep periods, this might prove to be a possible mechanism. If these encounters are in fact im- ages, we would need to address ourselves to the question of why the form of imagery is metallic spaceships and entities. Surely imagery has been with us through the years7 Looking back through time we do in fact find support. People exper- ienced \"visions\" and \"apparitions\" which were reported in a religious context; perhaps they became the village oracle or were held to be witches. In the middle ages we became afraid of elves, hobgoblins, and fairies. A percentage of the population could be found who ac- tually reported seeing such creatures in isolated spots, notably during the hours of darkness. Materialization and dematerialization of entities was reported. A general belief in all this pervaded all classes of people, with the grass roots of society firmly con- vinced. The 20th Century brought us a disbelief in such happenings; belief in them was seen as childish. Along came aircraft, rockets, missiles, and talk of extraterrestrial life. Many people today believe life exists out- side of the Earth. The jump from ex- istence to visitation has been strongly reinforced by science fiction films, books, and open discussion on the subject. I would suggest that we have merely moved the content of our im- agery from the supernatural to UFOs. NOTES 1. Central Standard Time — GMT plus 9Vi hours. 2.

At least two Lords were in attendance and so were some 350 mainly Euro- pean and American urologists. The Congress was sponsored by the British UFO Research Association (BUFORA). Featured speakers in- cluded Dr. Bruce Maccabee, Chair- man of the Fund for UFO Research; Charles Bowen, editor of England's prestigious \"Flying Saucer Review\"; Bertil Kuhlemann, of Project URD (UFO Research Data), Sweden; Hilary Evans, of the Society for Psychical Research; and Nigel Henbest, radio astronomy, Cambridge, and consul- tant in astronomy for \"New Scientist.\" Lord Kings-Norton, former Head of Britain's Air Defense, and current BUFORA President, convened the Congress on a Sunday morning. He was joined in the audience by Lord Glencarty, Brinsley le Poer Trench, who initiated the 1978 House of Lords Debate on Unidentified Flying Objects, in which both participated. Le Poer Trench is himself the author of several books about UFOs and a former \"FSR\" editor. In his opening remarks. Lord Kings- Norton noted that as a child he was often asked if he believed in Santa Claus and similar ephemera and that invariably the answer was no. But now that he has participated in the House of Lords Debate and accepted the Presidency of BUFORA, report- ers ask him in the same tones if he believes in UFOs. \"And I'm afraid this time I have to say yes,\" Lord Kings- Norton said. \"I do believe that life ex- ists elsewhere. I do believe that it will one day make itself known, and I do believe that man will one day com- municate with this life. But I do not believe that it has been proved to Lord Glencarty, left, with Staff Writer Dennis Stacy have happened yet,\" he added. Still, it was in the interest of perhaps resolv- ing just such a question that he was calling the Second Congress to order. And it was this dual tone of faith and skepticism that colored most of the subsequent proceedings. Robert Digby, BUFORA, delivered the open- ing address and asked ufologists, \"Have You Got Your Facts Right7\" Digby compared the ufologist's task with that of the police trying to reconstruct the events leading up to an automobile crash: both parties, he said, begin with what is essentially a cold trail. Thus, the witness becomes the main instrument of the investiga- tion and it is imperative that we begin to recognize this inescapable facet of the UFO investigation. This is also the reason why separate and individual witnesses are so imperative, if a contamination factor of personal or familial origins is not to creep into the report. Finally, Digby said, the investigator himself must beware of introducing his own contaminations into the case. Were your questions leading or other- wise designed to support a personal theory? Did you ask the witness what he or she saw, and not what you hoped he saw, for example? Bertil Kuhlemann of Sweden followed Digby to the podium and addressed the Congress on \"The Link Between Investigator and Scientist.\" Kuhlemann is Head of Computer Ser- vices for his government's IVA Ad- ministrative Department and is also a member of the Swedish Royal Acad- emy of Engineering Sciences. The link Kuhlemann proposed was the in- ternational adoption of Project UFO Research Data, or URD, a two-fold program designed to coordinate in- the-field data gathering with com- puter analysis of that data. Kuhlemann's proposal was also submitted to the Provisional Interna- tional Committee on UFO Research (PICUR) which met the day before the Congress in a closed-door meeting. The working party session (continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"London, Continued was attended by delegates from England, Scotland (Chairman Peter Hill), Holland, Denmark, Sweden, Italy, the United States, and Canada. David Haisell, of UFOCAN, repre- senting the Canadian UFO organiza- tions, proposed that Michael Sinclair, MUFON International Coordinator, be accepted as MUFON's permanent delegate to the committee, a motion that was duly ratified. This reporter represented MUFON in Sinclair's temporary absense. Dr. Bruce Mac- cabee, MUFON State Director for Maryland, a board member of CUFOS, and Chairman of the Fund for UFO Research, was the other U.S. representative. PICUR was originally established during the First International Con- gress in London in 1979 with the in- tent of coordinating the international investigation of the UFO phenomena. Anyone who has followed the some- times chaotic history of UFO organizations around the world realizes that the Committee has its work cut out for it. Too often, the civilian effort has been characterized by jealousy and a proprietary regard for collected data which has worked against the best interest of ufology as an objective and legitimate scientific discipline. Whether PICUR can reverse this sad state of affairs re- mains to be seen. In the meantime, the Committee has taken the first steps toward credibility and should be applauded accordingly. MUFON has long led the way in international cooperation and looks forward to working with others of a similar in- terest and intent. Project URD Project URD itself, developed by Kuhlemann's fellow countryman and . computer programmer, Bjame Hikansson, of Stockholm, is designed to standard- ize international investigative tech- niques and to insure the compilation of a minimum UFO data base accept- able to scientific analysis by com- puter. A field investigator's manual has already been prepared in English which would familiarize individuals Stuart Campbell (BUFORA, Scotland), left, with Hilary Evans (British Soc. of Psychical Research) with the use of the Project's Form A and B punch cards. Form A is in- tended to gather general information about the UFO sighting, including geographical coordinates, duration, and applicable meteorological condi- tions. Form B collects specific data about the UFO stimulus itself, such as size, shape, and characteristics of hehavior, such as changes in luminos- ity, movement, and audible sounds. As currently outlined, Project URD would employ an IBM 360/175 com- puter, a system already widely deployed around the world, including the communist bloc countries, which would greatly facilitate any future in- ternational interface. Kuhlemann also told the Congress audience that as ufologists they would have to ask themselves some very hard questions. \"Why do we not enjoy a wider acceptance among society and science at large, for exam- ple? Part of the problem is un- doubtedly because most politicians, bureaucrats, and scientists are still get- ting their information from media which tend to sensationalize UFO reports and thereby mitigate against personal involvement.\" But all too often, Kuhlemann warned, UFO organizations them- selves are to blame. By trying to exert pressure upwards in the social heirar- chy, ufology has defeated its own purpose. \"If we really want to see more of society's resources applied to a study of the UFO phenomenon, we must start at the top with the scientists and the politicians in control of those resources. It is up to ufologists to adopt the methodological approaches acceptable to science as a whole. And that means we need a body of reli- able, computer-processed data which indicates that there is indeed some- thing new and unknown up there.\" Project URD, of course, could pro- vide just such an indication and once that is done, Kuhlemann urged, there would be no reason why PICUR, or a similar federation of international UFO organizations should not be formed with the goal of seeking af- filiation with the International Coun- cil of Scientific Unions. Almost all of the Congress speeches were provocative, but Kuhlemann's may well prove to have the most reverberating consequences for the future of ufology. Time, as it has so often been said, will tell. Other highlights of the London Congress included Hilary Evans' com- (continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"London, Continued parison of traditional psychic phe- nomena with some aspects of contem- porary UFO reports. In particular, Evans pointed to the similarities in- herent in many UFO contact stories with the historical accounts of out-of- the-body experiences, so-called \"bedroom visitations,\" and \"orthodox\" poltergeist phenomena, including possession and instances of psychokinesis. Charles Bowen's \"Reflections of an Editor\" and Nigel Henbest's discourse on \"Implications of Black Holes for Space Travel\" were also well re- ceived. For the past 17 years Bowen has been responsible for putting out one of the world's most highly regarded UFO journals, Flying Saucer Review. First published in the spring of 1955, the quarterly celebrated its Silver Jubilee Anniversary last year. \"Like the world's economy,\" Bowen said, \"we are currently in a state of recession which greatly restricts our activities, and I cannot help but wonder why this is so.\" If, as sociologists tell us, UFO reports are a consequence of the stress modern life, Bowen wondered, then where are to- day's flaps, or periods of peak activ- ity, for surely the world has seen enough stress recently7 Bowen went on to cite the assassination of John Lennon, the attempt on the Pope's life, and the continuing strife in Northern Ireland, the Middle East, and other troubled parts of the world. \"Never before have there been more articles and books and movies about UFOs than there are now and still, we have yet to see the surge of modern reports that might be anticipated.\" But recessions have their oppor- tunities, too, Bowen noted, and work of lasting importance would be done, if investigators were to go back and explore in detail some of the earlier cases, particularly those from the early sixties. Bowen recalled several cases which were characterized by a high degree of absurdity. In Venezuela, a perci- pient saw two eight-foot tall beings emerge from an apparent craft in a beam of light. He was soon engaged in a conversation which contained the Charles Lockwood (BUFORA); Peter Hill (Chairman, Provisional International Comm.); David Haisell (UFO Canada) following dialogue: \"Are there more like you living among us?\" \"Yes,\" came the immediate reply, \"Two million, four hundred seven- teen thousand, eight hundred and five.\" \"Have you any powerful weapons?\" \"Yes, we have a compressor which can destroy the moon with only one discharge.\" \"Did you bring it with you?\" \"No.\" In another instance Bowen cited, not even the percipient himself could believe what happened. A Frenchman had encountered a disc-shaped object in a field. Standing between him and the disc was a dwarf-like being who kept repeating in a mechanical voice: \"Truth is refused to the constipated,\" and then, \"Cancer comes from the teeth (or: what is eaten).\" Nigel Henbest considered the physical improbability of at least one UFO theory in his talk entitled,'\"Im- plications of Black Holes for Space Travel.\" It has been proposed that UFOs may be interdimensional, i.e., capable of flitting between universes by a quantum mechanics process known as \"tunneling,\" in which a UFO in one space-time continuum enters a black hole in one universe and emerges from a white hole in another. The known facts, as Henbest persuasively argued, do not support such a supposition. As far as we know, black holes can only be formed as the result of a star collapsing, or going supernova, or at the center of galaxies where the necessary conditions may also be created. When a star such as our sun explodes, the forces of implosion may well compress the star's inner core to the degree that a black hole is formed, Henbest noted. Unfortunately, the black hole itself is not a thing to be treated lightly. Long before an astronaut (or ufonaut) could make use of a black hole's supraphysical proper- ties, he would be stretched asunder by what is called \"spaghettification.\" As an astronaut approached a black hole, say, feet first, contorted forces of gravity initiate what might be called a cosmic \"taffy-pull,\" stretching his limbs out in a long line while the upper part of his body remained for the time being unaffected. Paradoxically, however, the larger the mass of the black hole, the less the (continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"London, Continued tidal stretch effect. And where might the more massive black holes be found? At the center of galaxies, of course. But now a new problem arises; instead of the deadly conse- quences of gravity, a potential ufonaut must now consider the conse- quences of overexposure to radiation. A black hole at the center of a galaxy would inevitably begin to attract vast clouds of interstellar dust and gas, forming a tremendous spiral plane of cosmic debris. But as this matter moves closer and closer, faster and faster, towards ultimate absorption, friction creates tremendous heat and the resulting free electrons are thrown off vertically as X-rays. Again, any form of life or matter as we know it, could not possibly hope to survive such a close approach. In short, while not ruling out the possibility that some UFOs may have their origins in another solar system, the chances of their tunneling from one alternative universe to another via black holes is extremely remote if not physically impossible. But what about the Extra- Terrestrial Hypothesis itself, which has enjoyed somewhat of a roller coaster career since its inception more than three decades ago? This was the subject of Dr. Bruce Maccabee's talk to the Congress. ETH's fall from grace began in the mid and late 1960s as more of the patently absurd contactee cases were becoming more widely known. Not only were the aliens given to spouting juvenile theology .and ludicrous physics, but their own behavior was suspect, as well; not at all the sort of thing one would expect from a truly intelligent and advanced race of extraterrestrials. More recently, the ETH has come under fire because it was said to be ultimately unverifiable and therefore \"unscientific.\" But according to Dr. Maccabee, the theory's burial may have been a bit premature. He of- fered the Congress at least four ex- amples of cases which might not be explainable by any alternative theory: (1) the radar and multiple witness sightings of December 21 and 31, PERCIPIENT-DEPENDENT COMPONENTS IN UFO EXPERIENCES By Luis Schoenherr (Innsbruck, Austria) Hilary Evans' article \"Abducted by an Archetype\" in the April issue (No. 158) reflects a ufological trend which will gain increasing importance in the future. It is good scientific method- ology (and economy as well!) to ex- amine UFO reports from a psycholog- ical and even a psychoanalytical view- point before the men of the \"hard\" sciences move in. Which would be worse: trying to interpret true phys- ical data in psychological terms or to search for physical explanations where only psychological ones could be found? For me this question has been answered by the unproductive confusion of the last three decades surrounding the close encounter and abduction cases. There is no science which could supply us a reliable frame of ref- erence for the evaluation of the presumed extraterrestrial components in UFO reports. Therefore the most subtle arguments (and how many have 1 thought out myself) can only lead into inconclusive ambiguities and 1978, near Kaikoura, New Zealand; (2) the Lonnie Zamora landing report, outside Socorro, New Mexico; (3) the McMinnville, Oregon, photographs taken in 1950, which were closely replicated by another picture taken in Rouen, France, four years later; and (4) the Roswell, New Mexico, inci- dent of July 1947, alleging the crash and retrieval of an apparent flying disc and its alien crew. \"The Roswell Incident, of course, is potentially the whole jackpot,\" Mac- cabee said. \"I say potentially because it is not yet a completely investigated case.\" In conclusion. Dr. Maccabee urged that the theory of extraterrestrial visitation be maintained because \"it makes us look at things in new ways, and who knows? — ultimately, it may prove to be right.\" vicious circles. If the most notable astronomers and cosmologists assure us that, according to their probability calculations, there must be an incredi- ble number of inhabited planets in the universe, does this help us to prove in the specific, actual UFO case that the extraterrestrial visitors could or could not have had bald heads, luminous bodies, and bulging eyes? On the other hand we know a lot about man (albeit not enough) and there exists a large and well-tried body of theory and experience in the social sciences, which can serve as a basis of reference in the psychological approach. Moreover, the dominant instrument of ufology is necessarily the human being and it is this instru- ment that must be calibrated. This is simply a question of methodology and has nothing to do with mysticism or debunking. For these reasons the psychological approach should be assigned increased priority. There is of course no room in ufology for a psychology that. is misused for dis- criminating against UFO witnesses or even the whole field (similar things have in other fields led to the angry catchphrase of the \"terror of psychi- atry\"). It cannot be overlooked, however, that the indiscriminate attempts to in- terpret all phenomenal characteristics of UFO experiences in terms of realities existing independently of the witness, can only lead into confusion. But it is not sufficient to use psychological methods solely for the elimination of fraudulent and patho- logical cases. The implications of the psychological approach are far more important and I won't be astonished if those supposedly \"soft\" methods would some day yield more durable results than the premature application (continued on next page) 10"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"BOOK REVIEW The Roswell Incident By Charles Berlitz and William Moore (N.Y.: Grossett and Dunlap), 1980; 168p. The Roswell Incident is probably the first of several books to come from authors who will try to convey to the general public the reasons why the UFO \"community\" is presently be- coming more involved with the Crash- ed Disc Syndrome (CDS). The first occurred in the early 1950's with the publication of a book by Frank Scully entitled Behind the Flying Saucers. Scully's book was thoroughly dis- credited when investigators deter- mined that his sources were unscrupu- lous men, and that his book was filled with errors of fact because of poor re- search on his part. By the middle 1950's the CDS had faded ir^to the background of \"mainstream Ufology,\" largely as a result of the efforts of UFO buffs themselves. What, then, is this CDS which was rejected years ago as a possible solution to the fly- ing saucer mystery? And, more im- portantly, why has it been resur- rected in this more modern, doubt- less (?) more enlightened decade of the 1980's? The answers to these questions are quite straightforward, as will be seen. The CDS could be defined as the feelings a person gets and the actions a person takes upon learning that the government has in its possession one or more crashed discs with one or more occupants. More and more peo- ple are \"suffering\" from the CDS these days because of recent revela- tions under the Freedom of Informa- tion Act, and, more importantly, be- cause many reputed witnesses of such crashed discs are now speaking out about their experiences. The avail- ability of this new information is the reason why the CDS is being re- surrected. As an example of FOIA informa- tion, consider the following verbatim transcription from an FBI document dated March 22, 1950, sent from Special Agent in Charge (abbrev. SAC) in the state of Washington to FBI Headquarters in Washington, D.C.: The following information was furnished to SA (i.e., to the Special Agent) xxxxxxx (name crossed out) by xxxxxxx (name crossed out). An investigator for the Air Forces stated that three so-called flying saucers had been recovered in New Mexico. They were described as being circular in shape with raised centers, approximately 50 feet in diameter. Each one was occupied by three bodies of human shape but only 3 (continued on page 1 7) Percipient, Continued of the (not necessarily always \"hard\") natural sciences. There are, for example, indications that the tunnel-images, the large rooms perceived during (or perhaps only remembered) abduction experi- ences, may be related to the birth trauma. It will be possible to test this hypothesis by comparing the experi- ences of abductees born by Caesarean section with those of a control group. The experience of diffusely lighted in- teriors with no visible light source as well as the experience of being blinded, as it is reported again and again, may also turn out to be a memory of birth. Some psychologists tend to regard this \"light screen\" as the proto-hallucination of the dream and it seems that even prenatal psy- chology will have something to say about those matters. Jung regarded the discoid shape of UFOs as archetypical images and it is not impossible that they are in fact related to memories of embryonic structures. It seems to be a pre- posterous thing that a not yet existing individual brain should \"remember\" the embryonic shape of its later body. But concepts like Jung's Collective Unconscious or even Persinger's Geopsyche may help us some day to understand this. Ufology, however, should not make the mistake of going from one extreme to another. Now as before we should be aware of the possibility that the phenomenon includes impor- tant physical components. One of the goals in the field should be the verification of the hypothesis that in physical trace cases the reports them- selves are generated independently of the physical traces. This would settle the controversy about the percentage of explanatory myths (whose in- fluence is, for example, detectable in the development of folk lore) giving the remaining physical trace events a better level on the evidence scale. In my opinion the critical as well as the promising point lies in the fact that the UFO phenomenon is (if com- pared with any other conventional event) to a hitherto unheard of degree dualistic by its very nature. We can- not say at present that the physical or the psychic component is dominant. But the fact that there is such a discouraging diversity in the phenom- enal profile of UFO reports should be sufficient to indicate that the psychic component is probably far more im- portant than has been thought. In any case it is safe to regard every single UFO event (and not only the whole population of all reports) as an intricately interwoven complex of physical and psychic components. Any progress in UFO research will depend on whether we can find out how those two components interact and how they are mutually depen- dent. In a 50-page paper* I have dealt with this problem and some related topics. The paper demonstrates that, notwithstanding effective filtering factors, thought-provoking psychic material appears in published UFO reports and that even a case once unanimously regarded as an outright fraud is not that simple. To paraphrase Evans: could it be that some people possess inside themselves the do-it-yourself kit necessary for transforming collective or individual memory images into reality and is the modus operandi an interaction of the observer/percipient with an as yet unknown transient force or cgndition in his physical en- vironment? *Luis Schoenherr, \"Percipient Depen- dent Components in UFO Ex- periences,\" UFO Phenomena, 1980, Vol IV (Editecs Publishing House, P.

In these localities, dedi- cated investigators and researchers have banded together to collect re- ports, diligently weed out IFOs, and disseminate and publish meaningful cases. These well-watched areas, how- ever, are very few, and even in those places where public UFO reports are consistently collected, there are piti- ful pockets where no technically- trained observers are available to act immediately on a puzzling report. A flurry of sighting reports in the Los Angeles Basin, beginning on December 10, 1980 emphatically demonstrated this pathetic lack. But first — a brief review of the present situation of UFO research in this sprawling metropolis (approximate- ly 1,500 miles square) will point up the urgency which exists at times when researchers stumble against the \"pitiful pockets.\" Since 1965 I have been Project Co-ordinator of a filter center and tracking system in the Los Angeles Basin. Known as SKYNET, it has knowledgeable observers living in various places around the area, who are available to be called if an object — a potential UFO — is reported in their line-of-sight. SKYNET is small in size in relation to the area it presumes to cover. 1 Even though our present group of about 60 mem- bers does an excellent job, you can see how impossible it is to ade- quately cover such a large territory. One of our biggest problems, of course, is that the majority of public reports occur \"after the fact,\" that is, after the UFO has already vanished from view. Most of the cases which are long-lived enough to warrant activating the system involve objects which are identifiable. We have over the past 15 years, however, collected valuable, cor- relative material which gives rather substantive evidence of UFO \"win- dow areas\" in Southern California, such as the communities of Yorba Linda, Temple City, 2 and certain parts of the Tujunga Canyons. 3 Another suspected \"window area\" is over the offshore waters of the Pacific Ocean between the coast- line of Long Beach and the island of Santa Catalina, which lies 20 miles farther out. Evidence collected by this writer from 1962 through 1980 points to the possibility that this particular ocean area either attracts or permits the formation of huge, cigar- shaped UFOs. 4 At times these shapes are shrouded in clouds and are simi- lar to the giant UFOs which the French researcher, Aime Michel, termed \"cloud cigars.\" 5 Other times they seem to be unadorned \"shells\" or almost transparent. Cloud- shrouded or not, these huge UFOs invariably seem to be aggregations of smaller UFOs which depart from, return to, and maneuver around the main object. \"Cloud cigars\" are reported worldwide. They are relatively long lasting. The smaller glowing and/or metallic-like objects associated with them are sometimes called \"surveil- lance craft.\" In the Los Angeles area, the giant cigar-shaped objects hover or move slowly and seem generally confined above the channel waters. During four known appearances of these gigantic cigar-shapes since 1962, smaller UFOs were seen simultane- ously, making forays inland. The giant shapes have remained station- ary for as long as 3 hours. Recently, however, a flap of in- land sightings continued for weeks after the manifestation of a giant, maroon-colored, hazy UFO over the channel. (See Fig. 1.) The witnesses to this object, Mrs. D. G. and her daughter, 6 viewed it at 1:30 a.m. on December 10,1980, from their home in Hollywood, 20 air miles inland. It was the apparent size of three full moons and seemed almost trans- parent. It \"had a great deal of move- ment going on within its shape,\" but because of its great distance from the witnesses, they could not determine what the \"movement\" was. Its posi- tion in the sky seemed to be some- where around or past Long Beach. As it moved farther away over the Pacific, it became brighter and pinker. Its traveling motions were jerky and erratic, with abrupt shifts and extended periods of hovering. It shrank in size as it moved away. The entire sighting lasted about 5 minutes, but there is no way of knowing how long the strange ob- ject was in the sky before being noticed by the G's. No correlating sightings have surfaced up to the present time. Following this report, a virtual stream of UFO reports came from various inland cities in the Basin. They numbered on the average two or three per week and, except for a few, they were too numerous to even investigate thoroughly. 7 None of these 1980-81 reports, however, occurred simultaneously with the sighting of the December 10th ob- ject. It was almost as if, I speculated (continued on next page) 12"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"Pockets, Continued idly, that the giant cigar-shaped UFOs had \"learned\" not to stay around while the smaller craft were surveying inland! All of these cases, including the initial December 10th sighting, were received by SKYNET and other Basin sources \"after the fact.\" Then, on April 18, 1981, a call was received from SKYNET #1 in Hollywood. A Mr. J. R., who lived 3 miles southeast of SKYNET #l's location, had been watching a lumi- nous, white object with \"a red light on its tail,\" circling above his apart- ment building, darting in and out of thick rain clouds. Since SKYNET # 1 was unable, because of pressing family responsibilities, to handle the call, I phoned five other SKYNET locations within five miles of Mr. R's home to try to get an experienced observer to help determine what he was watching. As can be seen in Figure 2, these five locations formed a half-oval around Mr. R's site. Unfortunately, SKYNET mem- bers, like most UFO investigators, work on a strictly voluntary basis. They have no obligation to be home when they are needed to check out a SKYNET call — and they weren't. The urgency of this particular call came from the fact that a \"cloud cigar\" had been reported on Decem- ber 10th and numerous inland UFO sightings had occurred after that date. Suppose the disk-shaped light that Mr. R was reporting was asso- ciated with a \"cloud cigar\" hidden among the thick cloud cover which lay over the Basin? I had to know, but the pitiful pocket on the SKY- NET map where no members were available frustrated my efforts. It was suspected, of course, that Mr. R wa^ viewing searchlights on clouds. Numerous times after a rain, commercial searchlights playing on clouds appear as cohesive spots of bright, white light and are dutifully reported as UFOs. The light beams usually associated with searchlights are not visible from many viewing angles when the atmosphere is rain- washed and clear.

She also could not Jell me whether the Air Support Division had sent heli- copters to that location. In desperation I considered jumping into my car and driving 15 miles to Mr. R's home, but the prob- ability that the object was merely a searchlight on clouds dissuaded me. Mr. R had first seen the object at 8:15 p.m. and it was now about 10:00 p.m. The possibility that he was seeing an actual UFO manifestation continued to nag me. Talking with him again by phone, he continued to insist that the object had \"a red light on its tail.\" I tried to interpret how searchlights appeared without beams after rain, and tried suggesting that the \"red light\" was an afterimage. He insisted that he was watching something truly unusual. Then, as we talked, the \"object suddenly went up into the clouds and disappeared.\" About one-half hour later the object was back. This time it periodi- cally \"split in two,\" according to Mr. R's excited description, so that two lights were circling and maneuver- ing in the clouds. Both objects had \"red lights on their tails.\" A patrol car came finally, Mr. R reported, but the officers were busy trying to il- luminate the objects with their own powerful spotlight and could not (continued on next page) Figure 2. - SKYNET observers' locations maneuvers of Mr. R's object were familiar, too. In the past several years, at least three separate times, long-lived \"circling lights\" have been excitedly reported as UFOs. 8 I talked at length with Mr. R by phone. He described a \"very solid, white light, sometimes round, some- times oval,\" circling over his apart- ment. Two police helicopters were nearby, he said, seemingly inter- ested in the object. He described how the light occasionally \"dove up into the clouds, pushing the clouds around as it moved through them.\" Checking out his story with the police, I learned that no patrol car was available to go out on the call. The courteous woman officer on duty obligingly looked in the direc- tion of Mr. R's home and saw what seemed to be searchlights on clouds.

The Wilshire police station would not give me the names of the policemen who had answered the call. The pleasant woman officer was no longer on duty. At the switch- board was an abrupt male who was handling a police emergency. By this time it was 11:00 p.m., and I gave up for the night. The next morning I learned that another witness, Mrs. B, a neighbor of Mr. R, had seen the lights and identified them as searchlights on clouds. She had not seen any red lights on their tails! Checking again with the Wilshire station, I learned that no police report had been filed regarding the incident. So another IFO entered SKY- NET files, but at what cost! The pitiful pocket in that area of Los Angeles, caused by the unavailabil- ity of experienced observers, plus lack of cooperation by overworked police, was the cause. When will UFO research attain a funded methodology which will permit prompt, adequate fol- lowup on all potential UFO reports? Twenty-four hours after J.R.'s sighting of the \"maneuvering lights,\" what seems to be a genuine UFO was reported in the same area. From West Los Angeles, Barry Taff, a local psychic researcher and writer, 9 sighted a large, brilliantly lighted object about 11:30 p.m. on April 19, 1981. During the 45-second sight- ing, Taff noted rectangular \"win- dows\" along one side of its gray, opaque body, and the perimeter of the low-flying craft was outlined with alternating bright white and green-blue lights. (See Fig. 3.) 10 It was traveling from southeast to northwest at an estimated altitude of 500-600 feet above the ground. It was the apparent diameter of six moons. As it approached within about 2,500 feet of Mr. Taff's loca- tion, it made a 180 degree turn and traveled back toward the southeast, in the direction of the Long Beach- channel area. 11 As it turned, the \"windows\" were no longer visible, but Taff could still see the outline of Figure 3. - Apr. 19, 1981 UFO; West Los Angeles bright lights. That same evening, Mr. D. W. 12 of Huntington Beach independently viewed a rectangle of bright white lights moving erratically among the star field, traveling in a northerly direction. The configuration of four lights moved as one unit, in a pecul- iar manner of stops and starts. The time was 11:05 p.m. Mr. W could not say whether or not the interior was transparent, but he saw what seem- ed to be \"dull stars\" within the rectangle. Its apparent position was somewhere over Long Beach when first seen, Mr. W judged. Moving inland, it traveled about 45 degrees of sky in 15 minutes, then \"took a 180 degree turn\" and went back on its original course. It disappeared over the channel waters, moving upward into the sky. Both these sightings, unfortu- nately, were received by SKYNET the next day, after the fact. It is possible, however, that D. W. was actually seeing the same object as Taff, or a larger object associated in some way with Taff's smaller UFO. The two objects were not identical, but they traveled the same path in the sky at the same time. What was needed here was immediate reaction capa- bility to receive both reports as they were happening, or at least imme- diately afterwards, and enough avail- able, experienced observers in the line-of-sight to document these val- uable events. In a sense, then, in spite of the best efforts of Los Angeles re- searchers during the past two dec- ades, the whole Basin area might be considered one huge, \"pitiful poc- ket.\" Such is the state of the art today!

I have recently read the March 1981 edition of MUFON UFO Jour- nal and as usual found it interesting, especially the article \"California Re- port\" by Ann Druffel. Regarding her article titled \"An Open Letter to Dr. Carl Sagan\" I personally found it loaded with assumptions regarding the recent highly acclaimed TV series COSMOS. Dr. Sagan, like numerous others in the scientific community has an extreme propensity against the UFO phenomenon. All of us must agree that much of the UFO material; docu- ments, reports, photos, etc., are at best, pure subjective nonsense. The numerous sensationalized hoaxes, continuing misinterpretations, even by reputable observers, create an aura that strongly suggests the en- tire subject is one that belongs in the paranormal category. It's no wonder that Dr. Sagan or any other person, not involved with UFO research, would have a biased judgment to- wards the subject. It is probably un- fortunate that Dr. Sagan and others within the \"community\" have not taken the time to investigate/evaluate the unknown 5 to 10 percent of the sightings. Then, possibly, all of us would obtain a better perspective on the subject. I am not defending Carl Sagan or his views on the UFO phenomenon, but I do wish to impart some of GSW's opinions on Ann Druffel's extremely prejudiced letter. We know for a fact that the religious funda- mentalists of this country that view- ed COSMOS have the same bitter opinions that Ann Druffel is project- ing. When Dr. Sagan literally tore at their religious foundations with his excellent scientific segment on evolution, he created the same \"stir\" with the fundamentalists as he has done to the ufologists. In retrospect, Sagan has become the voice of anti- religious science, because of his factual presentation and exposure. When the recent classic California case was presented to the state's Supreme Court regarding \"equal time\" for religion in the classroom commensurate with evolution teach- ings, the media used Dr. Sagan as the \"expert\" in religion to represent the evolution forces. Now, by no stretch of the imagi- nation is Dr. Sagan an expert on re- ligion, but he was given that title because of his pro-evolution stand. Why does anyone consider Dr. Sagan an expert in ufology? Is it because of his national exposure on COSMOS and previous media appearances in which he took the anti-UFO stand? I personally think, with the broad scope of COSMOS, that Dr. Sagan covered the subjects as well as he possibly could, especially when you consider his previous proclamations on the UFO subject, the amount of time allotted, the script, etc. One thing Dr. Sagan did attempt, was the separation of science fact from blind faith. Let's examine some of the ERRORS/FACTS presented in the MUFON article. ERROR/FACT One, Two, and Three concern 'indicated\" state- ments by Dr. Sagan regarding the Hill abduction. Is it not fact that the Hill's indicated certain events during their regressive hypnosis sessions upon which many researchers tend to place great credence. Regressive hypnosis is very subjective and close to 22 states in this country are creat- ing laws to prohibit this type of test- ing due to its subjectiveness. I think we are arguing semantics regarding specific incidents about this \"en- counter\" rather than addressing the validity of hypnosis as a viable test- ing tool for close encounter cases. ERROR/FACT Four relates to the term \"UFO enthusiasts\" and/or buffs. The term is not only used by anti-ufologists but by everyone out- side of the UFO researcher com- munity. The term buff/enthusiasts is similar to comparing the UFO organ- izations as UFO clubs. Clubs tend to remove the professionalism when used to describe UFO researchers' affiliations. Yet, the term buff is a carry-over from the military/intelli- gence community. GSW has dozens of government documents which use the term buff. We are, once again, relating to semantics. ERROR/FACT Five and Six re- lates to the controversial Hill \"star- map\" drawn after a detailed study by Marjorie Fish. I believe Sagan was <i attempting to demonstrate the lack of significance regarding the star- map in much the same manner that pro-saucer researchers have attempt- ed to show the validity of the map. The basic questions still must be answered: (1) how can others draw similar maps by simply connecting the dots to other star systems and (2) how was the Hill data (original map) generated? Did some of this informa- tion come from the regressive hyp- nosis? (Reference article by writer entitled, Abductions/Contacts - Who's Kidding You?, to be released June 1, 1981.) ERROR/FACT Seven relates to navigational lines of the map which Betty Hill allegedly saw aboard the UFO. The point here is, simply stated, were the Hills actually aboard a UFO, or what they thought was a UFO? Until conclusive evidence outside of hypnosis can be presented, how can the UFO field accept this case without question. Are the \"essen- tial facts\" presented by Betty Hill the final, absolute word on this bizarre incident? ERROR/FACT Eight involves the deliberate \"picking and choos- ing\" of the stars for the Hill star map. This hints that the stars were a de- liberate selection to make the map work. This is a good point. How- ever, the UFO researchers who worked on the map only worked with data supplied by Betty Hill and it is an assumption to deduce that her information is science fact. I believe that the UFO segment on the COSMOS series should have had additional time to present other cases and facts concerning the UFO question. However, that was not the case. I believe it is preposterous to think that Dr. Sagan can make or (continued on next page) 15"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"BOOK REVIEW Casebook of a UFO Investigator, by Raymond E. Fowler. Prentice- Hall, Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey. 246 pages. $10.95 This book provides a rare oppor- tunity to view the work of a veteran investigator, covering the complete modern era of ufology from 1947 to the present. It is Raymond Fowler's personal memoir. The reader can feel the emotions that consumed Ray at the age of 14, locking him into a lifetime of detailed investigations, sorting fact from fiction during a time in which the United States was joining the jet-age. The novice as well as the sea- soned UFO investigator can gain from the personalized discussions about the growth of the \"cover-up,\" the exemplary application of the scientific method to the evaluation of UFO data by Dr. James McDonald, and Ray's own growth as an investi- gator. His details of the incident at Exeter, N.H., point out the need for the investigator to question all data and not accept \"answers,\" even from supposedly accurate sources. For example, Project Bluebook pro- vided a story about the Strategic Air Command exercises over New Hampshire, a story accepted by some people as the true explanation of the Exeter sightings. However, some critical checking of the facts showed that the alleged Air Force aircraft were not even airborne at the time of the incident. Sagan, Continued break the UFO movement, regard- less of his beliefs, anymore than any- one in the UFO field can bring the subject to number one prominence. With public apathy the highest it has ever been towards this subject, all of us are going to have to make the effort to place UFO research out of the stagnant position it is in today, with strong, absolute data. Only then will science ever consider it worthy of additional study. I am sure, that even Dr. Sagan, when given irrefut- able facts will objectively look at the evidence. The chapter on experienced wit- nesses dispels the old theory that only unreliable individuals observe UFOs. Ray provides the details of an analysis of local cases he personally investigated. His statistics cover the age, educational level, and profes- sion of the witnesses. The results were comparable to the national samples in that the young to middle- age groups, with better than average education, and responsible jobs were the prime witnesses of UFO inci- dents. The chapter goes on to de- scribe how the honest, childlike descriptions shared by children can be valuable to the investigator and important to the parents of small children that have a UFO experience. The careful questioning of a six- year-old Bingham, Maine girl re- vealed details of a humanoid close encounter case, a case not unlike dozens of others in the archives. The book has it's sections on wild goose chases and identifiable flying objects, with situations that most investigators will encounter sooner or later. However, the chap- ter on consistent characteristics of real UFOs brings the whole mystery into focus. It begins by admitting to the reality of the mystery. Then the details of hundreds of cases are drawn together to provide a shop- ping list of important characteristics. It all starts with a classification accord- ing to physical configurations, and then proceeds to cover maneuvers, strange effects such as radiation, electromagnetic, sound, light, smell, etc., and concludes with coverage of humanoid and landing cases. After reviewing these details it is easy to understand why Ray remains a dedi- cated investigator. Casebook of a UFO Investigator is unique in that it doesn't waste time alluding to the serious nature of the UFO situation. It provides the names, dates, and places. Anyone can go back over the material and check the facts. The result is a fine book for the casual reader, as well as the sea- soned investigator. \"Where do we go from here?\" is the title of the last chapter in the book. The answer is supplied and for my money it is worth the price of the book. —John F. Schuessler Letters Bailey Case Editor, My colleagues' letter (No. 158, April 1981) needs clarification. Semantical ploys therein throw false light on the Bailey case. No time spent on the Bailey hyp- nosis was unproductive. The case was an early, heretofore unexplored CE-III. Lawson was not an investi- gator on the case. He only witnessed the hypnosis. He cannot consider his 5 hours' time \"unproductive.\" Recently, R. Leo Sprinkle and Berthold E. Schwarz added input into the Bailey hypnosis contro- versy. In their broad views, Bill McCall's hypnosis techniques were proper, resulting in recall compar- able to any other acceptable \"abduc- tion\" case. Their comments will be published shortly. McCall's opinion that Rev. Bailey's recall was unreliable was expressed as an individual opinion. The con- certed opinions of researchers world- wide is that there seems to be some element(s) of objective or altered reality in abduction recall, and that the UFO phenomenon possibly in- dicates actual interaction of unknown intelligences with members of the human race. Lawson and McCall favor the hypothesis that the \"UFO phenomenon\" is produced by the human mind. That, in itself, is enough to explain their opinion that Bailey's abduction memories were unreli- able. The \"will to believe\" mentioned in the letter seems to indicate that most UFO researchers are victims of blind, mindless faith. This semanti- cal ploy gives no credit to serious researchers who accumulate corre- lated evidence through objective, laborious study. I was advised recently by Bill McCall not to bother answering the letter, since it was like a tiger chasing its tail. His comment, \"We're all in this together\" bespeaks of much (continued on next page) 16"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"Letters, Continued needed cooperation and camaraderie.

I have read with interest the thought- provoking contributions of Ann Druffel, Mark Moravec, Wayne LaPorte, Barry Downing, Bill Chalker, et al. including yourself, Richard Hall. May I congratulate you for ele- vating the Journal another echelon of professional-intellectual altitude. The yarn spun by Hilary Evans (No. 158, Apr. 1981), however, deck- ed me! In his \"Abducted by an Archetype,\" Mr. Evans drove me around Robin Hood's barn of logic just to zap me with this zinger of a UFO beam: \"For whether or not there is any reality underlying the abductees' stories, their characteris- tic features derive from some widely if not universally diffused scenario, which in its turn is made up of ele- ments deeply imbedded in all our subconsciouses.\" For cat's sake! Hasn't Mr. Evans read of the many abductions sub- stantiated by real, material, physical evidence? Surely he has been in- formed of the kidnapping and mul- tiple injuries to the three Liberty, Kentucky, ladies; the burns on their necks; the malfunctioning of their timepieces; the damage to the paint on their car? In what cloistered cell is Mr. Evans sequestered that he knows naught of the numerous abductions in which physical proof was de- posited? Is Hilary Evans metaphysical? No, he is pulling our leg. He spun his yarn with tongue in cheek, as do the jokers on this side of the Atlantic.— William D. Leet MUFON Arkansas State Director MUFON 1030LDTOWNE RD. SEGUIN.TX 78155 Roswell, from page 11 feet talJ, dressed in metallic cloth of a very fine texture. Each body was ban- daged in a manner similar to the blackout suits used by speed flyers and test pilots. According to Mr. xxxxxxx, informant, the saucers were found in New Mexico due to the fact that the Government has a very high-powered radar set-up in that area and it is believed the radar interferes with the controlling mechanism of the saucers. No further evaluation was attempted by SA xxxxxxx concerning the above. The above document was duly recorded and filed away with hundreds of other documents related to flying saucer sightings. The FBI has released well over 1,000 pages from its file on \"flying discs,\" and some of the pages provide very interesting information on the flying saucer \"situation\" in the late forties and early fifties. However, to this author's knowledge, the above document is the most bizarre. Could an Air Force investigator really have told the FBI about a crashed disc. . . or three such discs? Other documents in the FBI file refer to FBI attempts to find out from the Air Force just what the official position was on the reality of flying saucers. The response to such queries was almost always that the Air Force had no evidence that flying saucers existed. Moreover, the public state- ments by the Air Force, also echoed in the FBI documents, implied that the Air Force considered the UFO prob- lem to be quite unimportant. And yet, the Air Force circulated several top level memos requesting informa- tion about flying disc reports. One such memo entitled \"Unconventional Aircraft\" was sent out from the Head- quarters of the USAF, Directorate of Intelligence, and dated 15 February, 1949. That memo specified reporting procedures and was sufficiently de- tailed as to be, in effect, a sighting report form. Documents released by the CIA and other government intelligence agencies indicate a considerable in- terest in the early 1950's. . . .an in- terest which was not made public. Therefore the newly released docu- ments provide information which was only known to intelligence agen- cies at the time... .information which, although old, is \"new\" in the sense that it is in the public domain for the first time. But what about the other types of \"new\" information. . . .that which comes from the witnesses them- selves? Leonard Stringfield has recent- ly published short monographs on his collection of CDS stories. But the big problem with his research is that no one has been willing to allow his name to be publicized. And herein lies the importance of the book by Berlitz and Moore: the major witnesses of a \"re- trieval\" of unusual material have been willing to speak up after more than 30 years and to allow their names to be used along with the information they have provided. The most important parts of the Roswell book are based upon informa- tion obtained through extensive inter- views of the original witnesses by William Moore and Stan ton Friedman. These are the parts of the book which relate to the recovery of a mysterious foil-like material from a farm in New Mexico near Roswell. Other parts of the book tend more to speculation and even provide incorrect informa- tion related to other aspects of ufo- logy. For example, there is a list of highly questionable \"UFO reports\" by astronauts in orbit. To this writer's knowledge only one astronaut case remains unresolved (Gemini 11 photos) out of the eleven sightings listed. One section of the book discusses the possibility (presented as \"fact\") that President Eisenhower was, in 1954, \"spirited\" to Muroc Air Force base to view one or more crashed discs. Of somewhat more factual in- terest, however, is the transcript of an official Canadian document by Wilbert B. Smith who ascertained in (continued on next page) 17"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"Roswell, Continued 1950 through the Canadian Embassy that the matter of UFOs \"is the most highly classified subject in the U. S. government, rating higher than the H- bomb.\" Since the heart of the book is the collection of eyewitness accounts of the retrieval of a strange material and the subsequent Air Force reaction, I suggest the following \"reader's guide\" to the Roswell Incident: skip immedi- ately to Chapter 3 and read straight through Chapter 4. Then read Chapter 8 and note that the FBI file contains a teletype message about the Roswell retrieval. (Also note: the statement that a copy of the teletype was sent to the Strategic Air Command is wrong: SAC stands for Special Agent in Charge, not Strategic Air Command. Mr. Berlitz take note. The Air Force officer whose name was crossed off the partially transcribed FBI docu- ment was Major Curtan.) Having read this much, jump back to Chapter 2 and read through 2, 3, and 4 again. By this time you should have the, definite impression that an Air Force cover-up actually did occur, and that without the forthright attitude of (then) Major Jesse Marcel the public at large would still be in the dark about what happened in Roswell in July 1947. Major (now Colonel, retired) Marcel supervised the retrieval of a material that was like thin metallic foil, with thicker \"structural mem- bers\" and strange markings. The material was found covering a rather large area of pastureland several days after an unusual explosion was heard during a thunderstorm, and during a period of time when flying saucers were first being seen around the United States (1947 flap). The ma- terial was collected and loaded on a plane bound for Wright Field (Wright- Patterson Air Force Base) by Major Marcel and members of the 509th Bomb Group of the Eighth Army Air Force at Roswell. The news of the retrieval made immediate head- lines when the public information officer at Roswell Army Air Base re- leased an unqualified statement to the press that \"the many rumors regard- ing the flying disc became a reality yesterday when the intelligence office of the 509th Bomb Group of the Eighth Air Force, Roswell Army Air Field, was fortunate enough to gain possession of a disc through the co- operation of one of the local ranchers and the sheriffs office of Chaves County.\" The book provides copies of the original news stories and pic- tures of the principals involved. Immediately after the press re- lease the Air Force tried to cover its tracks by claiming that what was ac- tually retrieved was a weather balloon with an attached radar target device. However, by presenting the well- researched statements by Marcel and by the son and daughter of the rancher (the rancher is now dead), witnesses who actually handled the material, the book provides convincing evidence that strange material did not come from a balloon/radar target combina- tion. There is also evidence that the material, whatever it was, was sent to Wright Field for further study. . . . strange if the material simply came from a common weather device. The direct intervention of Bri- gadier General Roger Ramey in trying to arrange the cover-up, apparently on orders from the Deputy Chief of the Air Force, Lieutenant General Hoyt Vandenburg, also points to an event that is more important than the re- trieval of a weather balloon. Apparent- ly the orders to fly the material to Wright Field came from Vandenburg via Ramey. The astute student of UFOlogical History will remember that General Vandenburg was the man who, as Chief of Staff of the Air Force in 1948, refused to \"buy\" the inter- planetary theory expressed in the famous Estimate of the Situation written by ATIC (Air Technical In- telligence Center) investigators in the summer of 1948 (according to Rup- pelt, The Report on Flying Saucers, Chapter 3). A less well researched incident related to the Roswell retrieval is the retrieval of the main body of a crashed disc with occupants. Unfortunately, only \"second-hand\" witnesses to this more spectacular event were still alive (continued on next page) Director's Message, Continued member of MUFON as a condition of membership. 4. Many people are very interested in Ufology and desire to read the Journal, however, due to age or physical limitations, they prefer not to be involved in active UFO in- vestigations or research. These people may become members of MUFON as \"Contributing Subscribers.\" 5. All members should publicize the Journal in their radio, TV and news media appearances as recom- mended reading and how subscrip- tions may be obtained. UFO sighting reports received via the \"National UFO Reporting Center\" 24-hour telephone hotline number of 1-206-722-3000, through the coopera- tion of Robert J. Gribble, Director of Phenomena Research and MUFON State Director for Washington, and his associates in Seattle, Washington, have been instrumental in revitalizing MUFON's field investigative net- work. Cases are assigned to State Sec- tion Directors and Field Investigators living nearby and reported sighting for interviews and investigations. This not only provides the inves- tigator an opportunity to exercise his or her interviewing techniques, but gives them a feeling that their talent and services are being utilized and ap- preciated. We all must recognize that at least eight out of ten of these reports will be classified as an IFO (identified fly- ing object) after a thorough investiga- tion has been completed. The same amount of time could be devoted to an IFO as compared to an acutal UFO sighting before the distinction is made. This fact should not discourage an investigator, since he or she has been sharpening his or her investiga- tive procedures in either case. It is only in this manner that we will be able to obtain the raw facts associated with the remaining 10 to 20 percent of the sighting reports that constitute the authentic UFOs. 18"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"Lucius Parish in Others' words The July 7 issue of National Enquirer contains the first of a series of articles by Henry Gris on UFO activity in the Soviet Union. This initial report tells of.a large \"mothership\" and smaller \"probes\" seen over Moscow in June 1980. James Oberg's \"UFO Update\" col- umn in the July issue of Omni deals with UFO hoaxes. Oberg recounts some of the better-known hoax cases from 1897 to the present. For what it's worth, he describes MUFON as \"a well-organized private research group with a good reputation.\" Dr. Harley D. Rutledge has learned a lot about UFOs since 1973. When the town of Piedmont, Missouri became a focal point for UFO activity in early 1973, Dr. Rutledge's im- mediate reaction was that he \"wouldn't touch the subject with a ten-foot pole!\" However, in a short period of time, his scientific curiosity overcame his skepticism. As the head of the Physics Department at South- east Missouri State University in Cape Girardeau, he felt that UFOs could — and should — be studied with scientific recording instruments by a well-qualified team of observers. Thus, Project Identification was born. During the seven-year period, 1973-80, Project members had a total of 157 sightings of 178 UFOs. Numerous photographs were taken, with other data being obtained via in- strumentation. In his book, Project Iden- tification, Dr. Rutledge presents his ac- count of the investigations, as well as his conclusions about the nature of the UFO phenomenon. The book contains a wealth of information on the various types of UFOs observed, their colors, speeds, maneuvers, evi- dent interactions with the observers, etc. The photo section gives examples of the many anomalous lights seen in southeastern Missouri while Project members were on watch. It is Rutledge's conclusion that an advanced technology is involved in the UFO performances and, in some of the more bizarre reports, he finds it difficult \"to .accept the objects as a creation of man.\" Further, he believes the intelligences behind the UFOs are capable of mimicking man and his technology for their own subtle pur- pose^. To my way of thinking, there are relatively few books (probably less than 30) which make substantial and needed contributions to our knowledge of the UFO subject. Project Identification is definitely one of those books. Rutledge has conducted the type of scientific study which should have been done 20 or more years earlier by some of those scientists whose names and faces figure so prominently in the UFO literature today. Had they done so, they might have established some genuine credibility, not to mention adding immeasurably to public awareness of the UFO mystery. Project Identification carries my highest recom- mendation. It is available from Prentice-Hall, Inc., Englewood Cliffs, NJ 07632. The price is $10.95 for the hardcover; $6.95 for the softcover.

There were dead bodies in the machine. The witness did not have a good look at the device, how- ever, because a military patrol escorted him away from the area. The authors have conjectured that a flying disc had passed over the ranch near Ros- well during a thunderstorm and had exploded, dropping a considerable amount of material (outer skin?) on the pastureland. It had then continued its flight for several more miles before finally crashing.

Allen Hynek, keynote speaker at the recent MUFON UFO Symposium at the Massachusetts In- stitute of Technology, set the stage for future goals and objectives in Ufology in his paper titled \"Ufology as a Profession: A Manifesto.\" This challenge is being met by the Interna- tional Committee on UFO Research, an independent organization dedi- cated to establishing the study of the UFO phenomenon on a professional level worldwide. MUFON was repre- sented at their meeting, held in con- junction with the Second London In- ternational UFO Congress on May 24 and 25, 1981 in London, England, by Dennis W. Stacy, Director of Publica- tions. MUFON, as a respected UFO organization on the international scene, has pledged its support to the positive endeavors of this prestigious committee. Michael Sinclair, International Coordinator, and your Director are delighted to announce the appoint- ment of Dr. Nachman Ben-Yehuda as our Representative for Israel. Dr. Ben- Yehuda is a lecturer in sociology at the Hebrew University. His mailing address is Dept. of Sociology, Hebrew University, Jerusalem 91905, Israel. He has been very active in the UFO field in his country and. is plan- ning a symposium for 1982. Speaking for MUFON, your Direc- tor has invited the expanded Board of Directors of APRO to drop their isolationist policy and to cooperate with the other major UFO organiza- tions in the United States, MUFON and CUFOS. This proposal in recent .issues of the Journal has struck a responsive note with new members on the APRO Board and many APRO members, who have replied by letter and telephone calls. However, it must be pointed out that MUFON has not received any official reaction or statement from the APRO Board of Directors to our invitation, only from individuals expressing their personal confirmations. Elimination of petty jealousies is essential if the UFO community in the U.S.A. is to present a united front in resolving the UFO phenomenon and combating the vocal negative minority. The Third Edition of the MUFON Field Investigator's Manual edited by Raymond E. Fowler, Director of In- vestigations, is now in the formation stage. New investigative techniques and processes in scientific research are being actively solicited from Con- sultants and members at this time so that the new manual may be pub- lished early in 1982. The 1981 MUFON UFO Sym- posium Proceedings titled \"UFOs: The Hidden Evidence\" (153 pages) is now available from MUFON for $10.00 in U.S. funds plus $1.50 for postage and handling. The book will be mailed Fourth Class Special Book Rate unless otherwise requested by the inclusion of additional postage costs. Philatelists are reminded that MUFON still has fourteen sets of four of the Grenada UFO postage stamps issued by the former prime minster of Grenada, Sir Eric Gairy, to com- memorate \"Research Into U.F.O.s.\" The four mint stamps have a face value-of $5.40 and are being sold by MUFON for $4.00 postpaid until the small supply is depleted. The MUFON Amateur Radio Nets have met with various degrees of suc- cess throughout their existence depending upon the leadership and the frequencies involved. The 75 meter net is recommended for state groups or groups of adjoining states. The 2 meter, 6 meter, or 10 meter nets are very effective for State Sec- tion communications, where a limited range is adequate. The 40 meter net has been very successful for daytime communications from the east coast to the Mississippi River. The 10, 15, 20 meter bands are ideal for interna- tional communications and should be selected to conform to the \"skip distance\" prevailing at the scheduled net time. Citizen Band radio has been utilized effectively for local or field investigative work. We need volun- teers to organize and act as net con- trol stations for each MUFON net under the direction of Joe Santangelo, NlJS. If you are interested, please write to the International Director in Seguin, Texas, and we will forward this information to Mr. Santangelo. Due to the deterioration in quality of the UFO magazines on the news- stands and the sensationalist approach used by the weekly tabloids, the only creditable, authentic, and authorita- tive UFO publications are published by selected reputable UFO organiza- tions. In the United States and Canada, the MUFON UFO Journal is the only monthly publication of this stature. Since the MUFON UFO Jour- nal is a subscription/membership publication, it is obviously not available on the newsstands. For peo- ple interested in keeping abreast of the UFO'Situation and status world- wide, the Journal is the only current monthly scientific publication available. In order that this informa- tion may be shared with everyone in- terested in Ufology, a program has been launched to expand the subscrip- tion distribution of the Journal and MUFON membership' in the follow- ing manner: 1. Give an annual Journal subscrip- tion to a friend or relative as a Birth- day or Christmas gift. (MUFON will acknowledge your gift to the reci- pient with a card.) 2. Local UFO groups could pur- chase annual subscriptions to the Jour- nal for their public, school, or univer- sity libraries in their name as a con- tribution to the library. 3.
