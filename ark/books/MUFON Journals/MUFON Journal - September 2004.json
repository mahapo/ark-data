Schuessler MUFON Dive Team Many UFO sightings have been re- ported over water, as well as going in and out of water. This type of case is difficult for most field investigators to investigate, especially if there is a poten- tial for physical evidence being hidden in a body of water. Two MUFON mem- bers residing in Missouri, Debbie Ziegel- meyer and Tom Ferrario, have taken steps to John Schuessler remedy this situ- ation by forming a MUFON Dive Team. Both are already State Section Direc- tors and oversee investigations for the state of Missouri. Debbie and Tom are developing a list of certified divers nationwide that will form the MUFON Dive Team. This is a volun- tary effort. Divers wishing to be included on the list will be sent information forms and liability waivers. The information form will include cer- tification level, C-number, logged dives, equipment owned including tanks, cameras and underwater metal detectors. The list will be kept current by Debbie and Tom, and provided to MUFON Headquarters for quick access in the event of a water in- vestigation. Anyone interested in being a part of the MUFON Dive Team should contact Debbie Ziegelmeyer and Tom Ferrario at Post Office Box 181, Imperial. MO), 63052.

I saw a UFO.\" Being a MUFON field investigator, and having just completed a series of UFO sighting interviews for the local paper, I answered, \"Please tell me what you saw.\" The woman, who I will call Gallic, told of a fairly routine sighting, but I had a sense that she wanted to say more. We chatted, and as her trust in me grew, she asked if she could tell me about her daughter's ex- perience. I find the very best interviewing tech- nique for me is to just listen to the entire story, only occasionally urging the person on with phrases such as, \"and what hap- pened next?\" or \"how did you feel?\" I take notes, and only after the person is finished talking do I ask open-ended questions de- signed to get the person to elaborate on a particular part of their experience. A very condensed version of her story follows: \"In 1971, my daughter Marisa moved to a college-sponsored apartment. Being blind, she struggled both scholastically and financially. Determined to stay in school, she asked her counselor to find her a room- mate to help with the rent. \"It couldn't be a party girl, as she needed quiet in order to listen to the tapes from her classes. Soon it was arranged that a girl named Raechel would be her room- mate. \"In a get-acquainted visit, Raechel's fa- ther, a colonel in the Air Force, told Marisa that even though he was stationed nearby, he had adopted and raised his daughter on an isolated base in Nevada, and now wanted to increase her socialization skills by letting her go to college and have a roommate. \"Raechel was a perfect roommate, quiet and studious. Yet conversations were strained. \"Marisa would ask, 'What's your favorite musical group? I like Simon and Garfunkel.' 'I have never heard of Simon and Garfunkel.' 'What's your favorite song?' yielded, 'I do not have a favorite song.' \"It was frustrating for Marisa to have a lilSt This is a drawing of Raechel as Callie remembers her from their initial meeting. conversation with someone who didn't seem to have had a childhood, a past, or even a life. Marisa noticed that Raechel never used a contraction, nor did she use slang or colloquialisms. She asked Raechel to help her choose her clothes so the col- ors would match. The outcome proved that Raechel had no sense of color combina- tions. \"Marisa's tutor asked her why Raechel always wore a jumpsuit, long sleeved shirts, a scarf, and wraparound sunglasses, even inside the house. Marisa could only answer she didn't know, but she did know that Raechel had a difficult time physically. 'What the heck. I'm blind, Raechel dresses funny and is clumsy. We're a pair.' \"Occasionally my daughter's eyes would improve to the point where she could see fuzzy shapes and colors, with a mag- nifying glass. \"Each week Raechel would get visitors who, Marisa could tell, always wore dark suits. They always brought her some spe- cially mixed food and drinking water. Sometimes the men would ask Marisa to go into her bedroom and study while they visited with Raechel. \"Marisa was sure the men sometimes hit Raechel during their visits. She felt sorry for her, but there was nothing she could do to help. Editor's Note Although hybrid reports have been with us a long time, there seems to be renewed interest in the topic. (See the review in this issue of Budd Hopkins' and Carol Rainey's latest book. Sight Unseen). Keep in mind that the case described in this article surfaced well before our cur- rent knowledge of gene swapping. But note also that while this case suggests collusion between our military and the aliens, screen memories cannot beruled out. \"One day when I was visiting her, Marisa semi-joked that her roommate had to be from outer space: 'Mom, she's never heard the song, Bridge Over Troubled Waters. She's never had a boyfriend, she's never done anything a teenager would do. That base where she was raised must have been very remote.' \"As we talked, Marisa told me she could hear Raechel coming up the stairs and wanted to introduce us. \"Raechel was a frail looking girl, and was completely covered in clothes, and I assumed she had a skin condition. Raechel was polite, saying she was glad to meet me, and I replied something similar. \"As Raechel started walking across the room she stumbled and started to fall. She didn't try to break her fall with her arms, and I instinctively reached out to catch her. I will never forget the feel of her arm-it was smooth and cool, like a mushroom. \"Then her glasses fell forward on her face, exposing her eyes. She looked at me, fright registering in her large, avocado green eyes. She had no whites in her eyes; something was wrong with her pupils, I couldn't tell what. \"She just stared at me, trying to say something with her eyes. I heard a buzz- ing in my ears. I should have been more adult, but all I could think of was her cool skin and strange eyes. In a moment, she stood, straightened her glasses, said thank you, and went back outside. \"Marisa couldn't see what happened. I didn't tell her. It seemed I knew all about Raechel. I knew I had to find my daughter another place to live, soon. \"Being blind, Marisa knew what it was like to be different. Her roommate was dif- ferent. Marisa loved being accepted and"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"having friends. Raechel, as far as Marisa could determine, didn't have a friend, un- less you counted her father. \"Marisa decided to become her friend. Marisa asked Raechel why she didn't seem to have had any normal childhood experi- ences; did she have amnesia? \"Raechel knew that I had seen her eyes, she knew I knew all about her. She called her father, and he came over. Together they told my daughter about how Raechel was a product of a genetic hybridization experi - ment, originating on earth, then growing off earth, finally returning to an isolated military base in Nevada. \"The colonel told of the immediate closeness he felt towards Raechel when he first looked into her eyes. He told of her experiences and education, how she was adopted by him and a decision made to at- tempt to integrate her into society. \"Becoming Marisa's roommate was the latest step in the process. They had believed that with Marisa being blind, Raechel's physical appearance would not be an ob- stacle. \"It was enough for Marisa just to know the truth. They became good friends, sis- ters, sharing a secret they knew must never be told. Because I'd seen her eyes, Raechel gave permission for Marisa to tell me. \"One afternoon Marisa came home from her classes and found Raechel was not there. Marisa went from room to room looking for some indication of where she had gone. Walking into Raechel's bed- room, she saw a note taped to the dresser mirror. She took the note and sat on Raechel's now stripped bed. \"She read, 'Dear Marisa, You are my first and only friend. I will miss you very much, but I have left you a gift to remem- ber me by. Love, Raechel.' \"Marisa sat on the bed and looked around the room. Nothing was left. There was no gift so far as she could see. It took her about ten minutes to realize that Raechel's gift was the gift of sight.\" The woman, Gallic, stopped talking. An hour had gone by. She sounded exhausted, so we made a date to meet and discuss things further. I finished writing some notes and started on what would become a ten- year investigation. Inadvertently I had stepped into a house of mirrors and closed the door. I had en- tered into a place where paths led to places I didn't want to go, and reality wasn't what it seemed. Next month I will explain the steps taken in trying to unravel the web of mys- tery surrounding Raechel, Marisa, and the case I came to call, Raechel's Eyes.

Burned tree branches from Ohio case show no foreign materials FRONTIER ANALYSIS, Ltd. 17100 Wood Acre Trail Chagrin Falls, Ohio 44023 Phone/Fax: 440-708-2211 Email: BudingerPA@MSN.com TECHNICAL SERVICE RE- SPONSE NO.: UT034 Subject: Analysis of Tree Branches which purportedly came into contact with a UFO (Centerville, Ohio, March 6,2004) Date: July 11,2004 Requested By: Bruce M. Forrester, Zephyr Technology Reported By: P. A. Budinger, Analyti- cal Scientist Background/Objective: An unusual event happened in Centerville, OH, at ap- proximately 5:30 AM Saturday morning March 6, 2004 (see article in June, 2004, MUFON UFO Journal). Residents saw a UFO apparently inter- acting with power lines. The extent of the interaction was explosive in nature, and also involved the burning of tree tops. Flame and \"glitter\" from the trees were reported to continue for several hours af- ter the event. The objective of this analysis is to ana- lyze the exposed tree branches for any un- usual or foreign materials. Conclusions: 1.) No unusual or foreign materials were detected on the charred and unburned ar- eas of the branches. The results show nor- mal natural products from trees and nor- mal burn byproducts.-The natural products include primarily celluloidal material, some natural ester, a small amount ofsec- MUFON UFO Journal ondary amide, and trace amounts of pos- sible natural carboxylic acid salts. Burning by-products include carbon, calcium carbonate, calcium phosphate, in- organic nitrate, and organic oxidation prod- ucts, which are primarily carboxylic acid salts. 2.) It is worth noting that there are no radioactive or fluorescing materials. It is reassuring to know radioactivity is absent. 3.) The results do not confirm or rule out a UFO as a cause of the burning phe- nomenon. An interaction with such un- known craft could have resulted in normal burning by-products, and may not have left any unusual residues or craft deposits. Procedure: Samples: Several charred tree branches from the event were sent. Numerous infrared spectra were ob- tained from both burn and unburned areas of the tree branches \"as received.\" These were obtained on the Nicolet Avatar 360 spectrometer using the Harrick SplitPea (tm) sampling accessory. In addition, infrared spectra were also obtained from solvent extractions from the charred and unburned sections of the branches, as well as a control branch. Pro- gressively polar solvents were used, i.e. hexane, 1:1 acetone:methanol and water. The extracts were weighed for a quantita- tive estimate of their amounts. The branches were also examined with a radiation monitor (SE International's Radiation Alert (tm) Monitor 4) and a UV light (Optical Engineering's Model 22- UV).

The years 1966, 1967, and 1973 saw much historic intrusion, with the peaks coming in the fall months, and scattered activity other years. This area is mostly quiet little towns in rolling hills. I was comparatively young when Blue Book was active, but I was severely taxed in trying to keep up with all that was going on. However, I wouldn't have wanted to miss this incredible adventure against un- known forces for anything. So much happened during this time pe- riod that I can use only brief descriptions of important events: On an August, 1966, twilight evening a domed disc hovered over a barn a block away from State Road 44 east of Connersville, IN. It projected a beam that captured an auto from the highway, then its big doors closed, and it zipped away with the car. One witness had looked up at the figure in the transparent dome, then she and her brother fled to the house. It was yet an- other abduction in which an auto is later returned to the highway and the occupant or occupants have missing time. I had just worked on a good one down near Madison, IN. An orange glowing bowl-shaped UFO had taken Martha Cain, and she was very swollen . Her car's fin- ish was ruined, along with the rubber and electrical parts. Dr. J. Allen Hynek and another Ph.D. wanted me to have Martha hypnotically SEPTEMBER 2004 A pile ofredish soil-like material found after a UFO sighting in Fayette County, IN, in August, 1973. regressed, but no such person could be found in this Bible Belt area. On an early fall morning in 1966, two paper boys sat on their bikes at the end of John Street in East Connersville and watched a curved-top object with pulsat- ing colored lights on the river bottom field. The object had been farther south the pre- vious morning, and thought to be new lights on a transformer bank. There was the odor of sulphur in the air, and a high-pitched whirring. When they heard walking in the field, they fled up John Street. That evening one of the boys came back to the site and found three cone shaped holes, and a pile of reddish dirt off to one side. I had contact with a Maj. Quintanilla at Blue Book concerning all the activity that was going on, and this landing was quite interesting. He stressed aircraft flight pat- terns, and when he equated the John Street landings with swamp gas I of course had to laugh in disgust. Of course we know Blue Book was re- ally not sleeping-just pretending nothing was going on, since they were totally help- less in the face of it. In this time period I spent some time down in the strip mines area of south cen- tral Indiana where UFOs seemed to be coming out of the lakes. One night jets from Terre Haute chased one of them. Meanwhile, plenty was happening back MUFON UFO JOURNAL About the author Donald Worley, at 82, has investi- gated a number of cases over the past 39 yearswith NICAP and MUFON, and has also worked with CUFOS. He has written more than 50 UFO articles, has appeared on TV, and has willingly assisted other investigators. He has specialized in abduction cases, especially those involving the Nordic- type aliens, and has investigated more than 200 such cases over the years. home. One disc with a blue glowing dome glided very low over much of two coun- ties. It sent a herd of cattle into panic, and was seen by many witnesses. At the motel north of Rushville the owner-witness put \"Saucer Pilots Wel- come\" up on his marquee. On another night Citizen Band radio owners had a wild time chasing a disc over cornfields. Some coon hunters spooked a hovering UFO when they flashed their big light up at it, and it became a glowing fire coal, going away in three seconds. On a cold night in 1967 two orange glowing Saturn-type UFOs visited three ladies from the Haytown church in one's home. Thinking the end had come, they grabbed Bibles. One became incoherent, and as white as the refrigerator. In this same area a UFO revisited a lady"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"who had a UFO land in a pasture near her home several years before. It was from ex-sheriff Jim Caldwell that I learned what else happened to this lady besides prob- ably abduction. In this 1967 incident he found a very frightened person. In broad daylight a gi- ant ape-like creature had approached her back door. She unloaded a pistol into it at close range and it just stood there looking at her. When she dared to look again it was gone. Her dog was found with a heavy tree limb driven into its mouth and all the way to its stomach. I didn't mention this in a TV show I did on the Para-apes in Indi- ana. On Aug. 19,1973,1 was presented with yet another pile of reddish soil. The farm family watched the square-looking light down in the trees by the creek off Harris- burg road on two nights in one week. In the twilight it had risen up as a disc-shaped craft, and later flew east. The farm resident and I were there hid- den in some tree roots on the bank, but nothing happened. A pile of reddish dirt remained behind, just like the John Street landing. Specimens of the pile and nearby soil were sent to the Purdue University Agronomy Dept. to be tested, and no ab- normalities were found. I was not sur- prised, for there have been several hundred touchdowns with a variety of burns, mate- rials, fluids, and holes left behind, and they have not proven anything. The hogs avoided the site, and the farmer had found three circular 30-foot pressed down places in his wheat fields. The fall of 1973 saw the arrival of a domed disc in this area that had a trisected bottom and was well witnessed over a 15- day period. I know of only one jet vectoring, and that took place over the Hauler farm. Many factory workers at the DRUM plant, as well as people on Oak Street and at Laurel 10 miles south of here, saw it. At Laurel a truck's air horn sent it zipping away over the trees. I called another case the Davis Street Zombies case. On the night of Oct. 15,1973, the brilliant star that had maneu- vered in the sky on several previous nights descended to, or near, the ground at the end of Davis Street in Connersville. The long UFO had many brilliant yel- low lights on its lower part, a curved win- dow in its front, and seemed to be fish shaped. The abductee recalled that during a tour conducted by a kindly short alien she looked out the window and there stood about 10 people like statues looking at the UFO. The abductee's daughter, who re- mained in the nearby house, also saw these zombie-like people. I searched the neighborhood, and it was even written about in the local newspaper, but I never have found a single one of these people. Were they also taken on board? I suspect so, because previously I had cases in Anderson and near Indianapolis in which a group of people were abducted. One abductee saw what happened at a swimming pool, and at Anderson the abductee saw other zombie-like people. In this type of multiple abductions it appears that mental erasure is complete. On a cold snowy day in 1978 Pamara Johnson, who had already received the at- tentions of the aliens as a child, was re- turning home from near Abington in Wayne County. The UFO hovered over the tree tops (that were later found dead). Next the family found themselves driving home and three hours were missing. When they arrived home, Pamara crawled out of the back floor of the car and into her house. She was in a fear-stricken state, to put it accurately. Later that night she began to bleed from her vagina and felt empty. Next day the doctor who had confirmed she had a fetus announced it was no longer there. In later months Pamara began to re- call parts of her abduction-how four small aliens were around her and used a vibrat- ing wire device to take her fetus. She was shown a wall with rows of transparent containers with fetuses in them. One wonders if Pamara could have been just one more stop on a fetus gathering mission. Pamara's sister was also abducted, but would never talk to me. On her neck, hid- den by her long hair, was a strange scar that erupted each year on a certain winter day. Tim Brandenburg went down to the lo- cal sheriffs office and reported he had been kidnapped by a UFO. It made a few lines in the police blotter, and he was not be- lieved. It was a nice summer evening in 1991 on the south edge of Centerville, just 8 miles northeast of Connersville. Tim's wife was off to church . His dogs were howling in an unusual manner, so he went out behind his house to see what could be going on. In the darkness, low over the field, was this big curved object, and Tim immedi- ately began to back up in alarm. Little did he know \"they\" had come again for him, MUFON UFO Journal for \"they\" had gotten him in his youth. When the light beam hit him, all he no- ticed was a mild pain in his chest. He looked at the ground and turned to run. The next he knew he was looking at the floor in a room in the craft. Across from him stood two tall (Gray-type) humanoids. They began to come across the floor toward him, and in his mind came the voice, \"Don't be afraid. We are not going to hurt you.\" One Gray held out his arms toward Tim. Tim thought it must want something, and if he gave it something maybe they would let him out of this place. His hand landed on a $20 bill in his pocket. He handed this to the being. It looked at it, turning it over, then handed it to the Gray next to it. That was the last he ever saw of his money. Suddenly the Gray reached out with its long-fingered hand and grabbed Tim's arm. It produced a pen-like device and moved this three times laterally over Tun's arm. Next, Tim knew he was to go sit on a box-like chair. The Gray then held a cigarette-sized device near his temple. Late the next morning Tim awoke in bed. Since he and his wife were not get- ting along, she had not even disturbed him before going off to work. Tim was very sick, with blood in his nose and dark urine when he went to the bathroom. He remembered some of the evening before, and wondered if it had been a very bad dream until he happened to look at his arm. There were three long purple-reddish strips down in his flesh. I tried to photo- graph these, but failed. In his back yard were two 12-inch cir- cular browned grass spots about 6 feet equidistant from where he stood when hit with the beam. I didn't pick up any radia- tion or magnetic deviation from these places. Yes, the aliens were very active right under Blue Book's radar. In fact, as you see, it was not just in the air, but at ground level too. Estate Planning Some members and friends of MUFON have already included MUFON in their estate plans.

Bainbridge, Ohio Witnesses report encounter with entity Reported by Delbert Anderson Investigators: Pete Hartinger, John Fry, and Delbert Anderson, MUFON of Ohio Roundtown UFO Society. The witness, his nephew and the nephew's friend were going for a walk, looking for pieces of wood to make Christ- mas presents from. They were on their way home when the main witness (the uncle) looked behind and noticed a bright white light in the sky. When he arrived home he noticed that the bright light had moved from its origi- nal position (south) and was now in the west over a wooded hill behind their home. The third witness (the friend) had gone home, so the uncle and his nephew changed into warm clothing, got flashlights, and went up the hill into the woods and out onto a clear area at the top of the hill accompa- nied by their dog. They saw the white light hovering in the sky just above the treeline on the opposite side of the field. They signaled with their flashlights, and the object seemed to sig- nal back. The dog was looking at the light, and the other dogs in the neighborhood were barking. The witnesses then shined their lights on themselves. The light in the sky changed shapes from a pyramid to a five-point star, then a purple light began to glow around the white object. Then the purple light grew in size, en- f Drawing of entity touching hand of uncle while nephew observes.

When they looked back at the object, the witnesses report, they saw what appeared to be four to six human shapes on the top of the purple globe object, gestering with their arms. \"They had hu- man-like bodies, and we could see their heads and arms, but not their legs. It looked as if they were wearing robes.\" Allegedly, other red blinking lights were now circling the field. One of the figures on the globe broke away from the group and was slowly floating down toward the witnesses. The dog reportedly backed away at this point and stood in the shadow of the woods. \"The entity landed on the earth directly in front of us,\"said the uncle, \"about three SEPTEMBER 2004 MUFON UFO JOURNAL 7"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"feet away. It was made of the same purple light as the globe, and had no distinguish- ing features-no face hair, fingers, legs, appearance of clothing-it was just light with form. We tried to communicate with it, but received no answer either in word or telepathically. \"So I decided to extend my hand out to- wards it-in a manner of goodwill. The fig- ure put its arm out and put its hand on mine. I could not feel any type of pressure on my skin, nor did I get any tingling sensation or feeling of heat or cold. Instead it was as if I was being touched by a hologram. \"I again tried to communicate with it and told it my name was Michael, and my nephew told it his name was (withheld by investigator). Again we got no type of re- sponse. \"One of the red blinking lights left its position in the sky on our left in the south and flew towards the white light, which was in the west. Then it went to our right in the northern sky, cut across the field right above us, and continued on until it was once again in the south. \"Then the white light began to lower itself until it was behind the tree line of the wooded area across from us. The purple light which had enveloped the field disap- peared, along with the figure which had been standing before us.\" At this point the witnesses could no longer see anything except the white light behind the trees and found they were get- ting cold and went home. The uncle speculated that \"maybe we had experienced more than we could re- member.\" He also notes that the encoun- ter had been a positive experience for him. \"I was suffereing from depression, something I have battled for some time. But the encounter with whatever type of entity it was gave me a better outlook on life, and I feel much better about myself and the future.\" Sighting investigation We interviewed both the chief witness and his young nephew. The nephew's friend had since moved away. The wit- nesses' testimony was compatible, but there are problems with the fact that this is a case of very high strangeness, and ex- traordinary claims require extraordinary evidence. All we have, however, are the witnesses' claims. A check of star charts revealed several bright lights in the sky on this date in the west, and also in the south. The bright stars Vega, Deneb, and Altair, as well as the planet Venus, were in approximately the west. Mars was in the south. - Atmospheric conditions could have made the stars appear to change in size and color, as well as position. One other point is that the area where this incident took place is in the flight pat- tern of Air Force jets out of Wright- Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton, OH. The weather reports seem to agree with what the witnesses said about the weather: snow on the ground, clear visibility, and turning cold in the evening. Because of the fact that the second wit- ness is a minor and a relative of the main witness, the case is not as good as if there were an independent witness. There did not appear to be any attempt to deceive on the part of the witnesses, but in the end all we have are very unusual claims. We are in agreement that on a scale of 10, with a rating of 10 being the best, that this case rates a 4 in terms of Strangeness and Reliability. I would rate this case one of Ordinary Significance based on the MUFON categories of Great Significance, Significant, Ordinary, and Borderline. \"Mantis\" entities reported in Arkansas On Wednesday, August 4, 2004, at 10 PM, eyewitness A.T. and his girlfriend were lying on the grass in Kay Rodgers Park, just off Midland Boulevard in Fort Smith, AR, (population 80,268) when they reportedly spotted two strange figures nearby. \"My girl friend and I were hanging out at a local park when we saw two figures walk out of the bushes about 10 feet away from where we were sitting,\" says A.T.. \"They wore grey or off-white tunic-style outfits. They had shiny bronze or gold medallions on the center of their chest or shoulder.\" He continues: \"They had (preying) man- tis-like heads and made strange clicking noises. Their eyes would change from blood red to neon green. We stood there staring at each other for five or six min- utes, when they disappeared into a white light. \"Both were approximately seven feet tall, but the one on the left was a few inches shorter. They appeared from the south (the Harper Stadium area) at an average walk- ing speed.\" (Email form report). Thanks to UFO Roundup, No. 22, Joseph Trainor.

DNA decipherer Francis Crick dies Nobel Prize-winning scientist Francis Crick, 88, who co-discovered the spiral, \"double-helix\" structure of DNA in 1953 and opened the way for everything from gene-spliced crops and medicines to DNA fingerprinting and the genetic detection of diseases, has died. Crick died July 28 after a battle with colon cancer, according to the Salk Insti- tute, the research body where Crick worked in recent years. The British-born Crick was 36 and working at the University of Cambridge's Cavendish Laboratory in 1953 when he and the American-born James Watson, just 24, struck upon the idea that the DNA molecule resembles a twisted ladder. After making the discovery, Crick an- nounced that he and Watson had \"found the secret of life.\" But only a few people at the time \"even thought it was interest- ing,\" Crick once said, and it took years before the groundbreaking discovery was firmly accepted. Decades later, the discovery's impact can be seen everywhere. It laid the foun- dation for the biotechnology industry, en- abling scientists to engineer bigger toma- toes, doctors to pursue gene therapy to treat disease, and police to solve crimes through DNA evidence. Building on the work of Crick and Watson, and that of others over the de- cades, scientists can now alter genes to breed out disease and breed in desired traits. That newfound power has stirred ethi- cal debates, but Crick said there was no way in the 1950s that he could have fore- told modern DNA developments. Biotechnology is a $30 billion-a-year industry that has produced some 160 drugs and vaccines, treating everything from breast cancer to diabetes. Seven million farmers in 18 countries grew genetically engineered crops last year, allowing them to grow food with fewer pesticides. Crick's work \"helped to usher in a golden age of molecular biology,\" said Lord May of Oxford, president of Britain's academy of scientists, the Royal Society. Crick and Watson were awarded the Nobel in medicine in 1962. Watson's 1968 best seller \"The Double Helix\" told how he and Crick used bits of wire, colored beads, sheet metal and card- board cutouts to construct a 3-D model of the molecule.

Summary In the early morning hours (about 0437) of 21 November. 2003, Robert Williams, 20, of Deerfield Township,MI. went to the back door of his and his mother's home to smoke. As he leaned out the sliding glass doors, he noticed an extremely bright white light out of the corner of his eye. Robert stated that the light was \"brighter than anything I'd ever seen,\" and was hovering over Bennett Lake at an es- timated altitude of about 50-60 feet from the surface of the wetlands that are adja- cent to his home. It was about the size of a fifty-cent piece held at arms length. Robert watched this intense light for about 1-2 minutes before running to the bedroom where his mother, Chistine Wil- liams, was sleeping, and excitedly asked her to come and see what he was looking at. Christine, noticing the serious, but ex- cited, tone of her son's voice, proceeded to the back deck area of their home. She was amazed at what she saw. As Robert and Christine watched the object that they estimated to be about 500-600 yards away, they noticed that it remained motionless and continued to hover just below the treeline, even though the wind that morning was coming from the WSW at about 9 miles per hour. They continued to watch this object for about another 2-3 minutes before it began to move in a straight Line from the NNW, where they originally observed it, to the WSW at an estimated speed of 5-7 MPH.. Since both witnesses had lived next to Selfridge Air Force Base prior to their move to Bennett Lake, they were accus- tomed to watching various aircraft taking off and landing at any given time. Both witnesses stated that the object moved in a fashion that was unfamiliar and, in their estimation, far too slow to be a conventional aircraft. SEPTEMBER 2004 Drawing of object from MUFON sighting questionaire. As the object approached the small resi- dential community and moved to within 250-300 yards of the witnesses, the intense white light began to dim, and both wit- nesses were able to make out a defined structure. They agreed that the object had a definite \"frisbee\" shape, and was com- plete with individual white lights around the perimeter. Around the bottom of the \"craft\" were intense blue lights that appeared to swivel as the craft moved and lent a bright blue glow to the underside of the craft. According to Christine, it appeared as though the craft was \"sightseeing. \" Rob- ert reports that the craft appeared to be \"looking for something.\" Both witnesses were in agreement that the object moved in complete silence, and was close enough that, had it been a plane, the engine(s) would have \"blown us back into the living room.\" As the \"craft' approached, Robert wanted to flash the back porch lights at the object to see what would happen, but Christine, being understandably apprehen- sive, refused to allow Robert to do this. The witnesses continued to watch the \"craft\" for another 2-3 minutes before it was blocked from view by houses that sit across the small inlet from the Williams' back deck. These houses are about 230-300 yards from the witnesses' home. Shortly after the object had gone from view, a large cargo type plane, traveling on the same flight path that the \"craft\" had taken (WSW), was seen and heard to fly MUFON UFO JOURNAL over the exact area where the craft had been sighted, and was low enough to rattle the windows in the home of Robert and Christine. Both witnesses state that this was highly unusual, as that type of aircraft had not been seen in that area at any time prior to the sighting. This may or may not be of relevance, since Bishop International Air- port is located approximately 15 miles NE of the sighting area (Flint), and is capable of handling this type of aircraft. Weather data An infrared satellite photo (taken at 0505) obtained via internet search revealed that this portion of Michigan was clear to partly cloudy on the morning of Nov 21, 2003. NWS archives for the month of Novem- ber, 2003, were also checked, verifying that the wind was out of the WSW at an average speed of 9.7 MPH, with a max. wind speed of 16 MPH and gusts to 20 MPH. Further analysis for this date shows that at 0453 the temperature was 42.1 deg. F and humidity was 80%, with a visibility of 10 miles. Actual time of sunrise for this date was 7:34 AM EST.

Animal reactions This area is a protected wetlands that covers several acres, and is directly adja- cent to the home of Christine and Robert. This wetlands area surrounds the entire community located at Bennett Lake, and is constantly alive with different species of waterfowl and various other wildlife. At the time of the sighting, there were no animal or bird sounds noted by the wit- nesses, and everything in the area was com- pletely quiet. Although it is believed that this would normally not be unusual for this time of day, both Christine And Robert noted that there wasn't any wildlife activity in the area for a 5-7 day period following the sighting. Birds would not land, and normal ani- mal sounds that are present at any given time of day were not evident. Christine stated that even birds that nor- mally flock to her birdfeeder would not approach the area. Messenger spacecraft blasts off for Mercury An early morning launch Aug. 3 sent NASA's Messenger spacecraft on its way to Mercury. All systems appear ready for a planned 4.9-billion-mile trip to the Sun's closest planet, say mission controllers at the John F. Kennedy Space Center. The $427 million probe will fly by Ve- nus (twice) and Mercury (three times) on its way into orbit around the planet in 2011. From orbit, the spacecraft will map Mer- cury while probing its magnetic and min- eral characteristics with unprecedented detail. \"We will see things that no human has ever seen, and know infinitely more about the formation of the solar system than we know today,\" says Michael Griffin of the Johns Hopkins University Applied Phys- ics Laboratory, which built the spacecraft and manages the mission. Messenger (short for Mercury Surface, Space environment, Geochemistry, and Ranging) is the first mission to Mercury in three decades. About one-third the size of Earth, Mer- cury orbits the sun once every 88 days, but it spins so slowly that a day on Mercury lasts nearly six months on Earth. The planet endures temperatures above 840 degrees (Fahrenheit) on its days and minus 350 degrees at night. 10 NASA scientist says possible Martian microbes should be studied By Leonard David A future astronaut traipsing across the landing sites of the Mars Exploration Rov- ers \"Spirit and Opportunity\" might be squishing into a welcome mat of microbes, according to one NASA scientist. While the twin robots push ahead in scouring their real estate locations at Gusev Crater and Meridiani Planum, they leave behind a tantalizing trail of issues that need to be sorted out. One big unknown: did life ever take root on Mars? And if so, is that planet home to living organisms today? So far, the life- on-Mars card has not played out. Rover scientists have seen nothing they regard as needing a biological explanation. But the twin robot landers weren't built to prowl around for life. According to David McKay, chief sci- entist for astrobiology at NASA's Johnson Space Center in Houston, TX, visual evi- dence from the rovers is pretty enticing. The chronicle of Mars being viewed as a comfy habitat for biology is an unfold- ing one, and McKay led the research group that in August, 1996, presented evidence of ancient life from Mars. The observa- tions, the researchers said, strongly sug- gested primitive life may have existed on Mars more than 3.6 billion years ago. The NASA-funded team found the first organic molecules thought to be of Mar- tian origin, several mineral features char- acteristic of biological activity, and pos- sible microscopic fossils of primitive, bac- teria-like organisms inside an ancient Mar- tian rock that fell to Earth as a meteorite- the often-called \"Mars Rock,\" or as scien- tists like to professionally label it: ALH84001. \"I've seen the saga move from 20 or 30 years ago when virtually no one believed there was life on Mars, or that there was even water on Mars,\" McKay said. \"Now the whole pendulum is swinging.\" McKay said it is now clear a lot of wa- ter flowed across Mars. Furthermore, there may still be water spurting out onto the planet at certain times. \"The same pendu- lum may be swinging back toward life,\" he said. \"We'll wait and see. These are exciting times. The Mars rovers represent an incredibly successful mission.\" Moreover, they seemingly have uncov- ered a major find. He points to pictures taken by the rovers that show areas of the MUFON UFO Journal Martian surface disturbed by the retrac- tion of landing airbags. Patches of surface \"acted as a cohesive blanket of some sort\" when the airbags pulled back, McKay explains. \"It didn't simply crack apart like a dried-up crust. But one possibility is that this is the fossil- ized remains of a biological mat of some sort.\" The mat would be made up of bacterial parts and pieces. That claim can't be proven at this point, McKay said. \"That's one reason you have to go get samples to be sure. Mars has all the conditions for life: water, energy, and organic substances.\" He says that \"it is very clear that Mars was a habitable place in terms of life as we know it. Meteorite evidence show there was microbial life on Mars, and for all we know, there still could be. It's hard to kill off life once it has started.\" Early in the mission of Spirit at Gusev Crater, scientists dubbed the region messed up by landing bags as the \"Magic Carpet.\" The crumpled portion of the soil appeared to have been peeled away, as noted by rover scientists. \"I think there's really something there,\" McKay told SPACE.com. \"There is some cohesiveness to that material. Talk about the Magic Carpet just went away. I don't think it should have gone away.\" He pointed to work being done at Guerrero Negro, Baja California, by NASA's Ames Research Center on the evolution of a microbial community func- tioning in microbial mats. \"They've also produced some in the lab,\" he notes. \"You pick that stuff up and it's kind of like a fabric. It is fairly cohe- sive. A crusty material like dura crust breaks up immediately.\" According to a NASA Ames web site, microbial mats here on Earth are impor- tant because their 3.4-billion-year fossil record indicates they are our planet's old- est known ecosystems.

Or snakes in the grass By Bey Trout MUFON Iowa State Director The above title sounds provocative, which seems appropriate to me, given some of the fairly radical sounding state- ments made by some abductees and re- searchers. I'm refer- ring to those who maintain there are some human-appear- ing individuals among us who have an ability to meta- morphose into reptil- ian form. Is this true? Per- haps. Perhaps not. I do not know, al- though I have en- countered friends who say they have psy- chically perceived humans who in reality are reptilian, and I have listened and re- spected their assertions, based on their own psychic perception. It is true that many abductees, myself included, have reported reptilians perform- ing extremely intrusive physical proce- dures (that all aliens seem capable of). Beyond that, some abductees have ac- cused the reptilians of sexual abuse, as well-although we must not forget that there are also humans reporting sexual eupho- ria in their interaction with reptilian aliens. And in addition to these conflicting and somewhat unsettling reports, there are those abductees who indicate some sort of mental and emotional reptilian efforts to penetrate the human psyche, for reasons about which there is considerable specu- lation. In presenting my perspective, I need, at the outset, to make plain that I am no apolo- gist for aliens, be they grays, reptilians, or whatever, nor am I an apologist for humans (myself included) regarding the interaction that takes place during encounters. When I stand before audiences to talk about this subject, I ask the following (without tongue in cheek): Have you per- haps scanned your fellow humans to check for some sort of reptilian overlay? Have you looked at your friends and neighbors, maybe even your relatives, seeking further answers on a possible reptilian presence in the human scene? I also ask if an audience wonders if somehow there are reptilian genes verbal- izing through the speaker-myself-as I stand before them. At this point, of course, there's usually a titter from the audience, but I'm quite serious in posing the question about such a seemingly far-out possibility. And there may, in- deed, be some percep- tion of such reptilian presence among us. Bev Trout  And then I ask the following: HAVE YOU EVER STOPPED TO CONSIDER WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF YOU SUDDENLY FOUND YOUR- SELF ABLE TO SAY: \"WELL SO WHAT!!!\" I have to say that when I speak and look out over an aud ience and find my self scan- ning them, I do find myself able to sincerely say, \"I DON'T CARE\" if I perceive some sort of reptilian presence associated with my fellow humans, or with myself. Frankly, I AM in a SO WHAT!!! FRAME OF MIND! And I don't mean to sound glib, to sound uncaring. That's not where I'm coming from; I would not want to be misunder- stood at this point. Of course there are rogues among the reptilians. And of course the whole encounter situ- ation is loaded with massive manipulation - and I haven't figured out how to get them to go back where they come from, nor have I figured out how to get them to move on. And beyond that, I'm faced with the DICHOTOMY that I and most other abductees that I've interacted with ARE NOT REALLY INTERESTED IN HAV- ING THE ALIENS GO AWAY, even though we find ourselves in dicey encoun- ter situations where the word INTRUSIVE hardly lives up to the interaction that's been described by so many abductees, myself included. So, although I do not lightly assess rep- tilian aliens-nor any other aliens, for that matter-I have to honestly say that I still remain in a SO WHAT frame of mind. To explain, let me offer the following thoughts: For a moment, let's consider one day as a metaphor for a whole lifetime. If, early in this one metaphorical day, we've come to realize that interacting with our fellow humans as creatively as pos- sible needs to be a primary task in our lives (if we're to remain spiritually and psycho- logically healthy, that is), and then later in that \"one day\" we become consciously aware of our involvement with reptilian aliens, I ask you, as I've asked myself: IS OUR PRIMARY TASK ANY DIFFER- ENT THAN IT WAS EARLY IN THAT ONE DAY? Oh, of course we may now realize the additional need to interact creatively with aliens, as well as humans, but the basic nature of our primary task, it seems to me, has not changed. Now, in offering some of these state- ments, I suppose I may be laying myself open to the question of whether I've been co-opted by the aliens to speak kind words about reptilians. And I might be inclined to consider the co-option possibility myself if it were not for the fact that I have been, and still am, highly critical of present alien-human in- teraction-and in most cases I'm critical on both the alien and the human side of that equation. Frankly, I'm intensely interested in get- ting on a more level playing field with all the aliens, reptilians included. In assessing our present reptilian-human relationship, I have felt a compelling ur- gency to probe, to take a closer look at our ancient past, because in addition to all the talk going around today, in modem times, about reptilians interacting with us, we need, I believe, to remind ourselves that a reptilian connection, a reptilian presence, has been recorded in a highly visible way in ancient records as well. For those who might want to explore in great depth, there are books authored by those who have investigated the ancient writings which direct the reader toward the sources of some very pointed references to SEPTEMBER 2004 MUFON UFO JOURNAL 11"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"reptilians associated with our human past. For instance, as told in Dead Sea Scrolls Uncovered, by Robert Eisenman and Michael Wise, among the Dead Sea Scrolls discovered in 1947 is a document attributed to the father of Moses, which provides a physical description of \"watch-, ers\" over this planet. The narrative clearly points to some of the \"watchers\" having a reptilian look. The author, Moses' father, in describing his en- counters with the \"watchers\" said, \" terrifying in his appearance.. ..visage like a viper,\" and so on. A book authored by R. A. Boulay, who incidentally was a cryptologist with the National Security Agency (NSA) until his retirement in the late 1970s, is entitled Fly- ing Serpents and Dragons, with a subtitle, The Story of Mankind's Reptilian Past. It's a fascinating read, and I think a rather informative book in which specific historical and religious texts are cited from various cultures as referring to mankind's reptilian connection. In a fragment from one of the Sumerian Tablets dated to about 3500 BC, there is a description of the coming of the \"gods\" to this planet from the skies, long before the Deluge, and the reptilian nature of these \"gods\" is explicit. Consider this one-liner: \"The reptiles verily descend.\" For me, it's interesting to note that a Sumerian term used to describe \"flying serpent with flaming breath\" was U- SHUM-GAL, which was a common epi- thet for the scientist god/alien, Enki, and other major gods that Zechariah Sitchin has written about in detailing his research into the Sumerian Records. And what's interesting to me is that this term, U-SHUM-GAL is translated by modern scholars as simply one word, \"dragon.\" Author Boulay points to the University of Pennsylvania Sumerian Dic- tionary, Volume 2, where U-SHUM-GAL is translated simply as \"dragon.\" There are also ancient Sanskrit sources which tell of a serpent race which de- scended from the skies and taught mankind; as well as South American cultures refer- ring to their serpent gods. Although I'm naming only a few refer- ences, there are actually many cultures in which a dragon or serpent represents di- vine heritage or royalty, and we need to remind ourselves that even in the West the serpent is a symbol of wisdom and knowl- edge-we're all familiar with the caduceus (two serpents coiled around a staff) which is used by the American Medical Associa- tion as its logo, its symbol of healing. This image on rock in Northern Tanzania, Africa, is thousands of years old, but it could easily pass for an abduction event being carried out by reptilians today. It was discovered by anthropologist Mary Leakey. (Isn't it somewhat ironic that we hu- mans, even in the Western world where very few of us fancy ourselves as herpe- tologists, have somehow managed to el- evate the reptilian image to a healing sta- tus!!) Given our predominantly Christian heri- tage in which serpents are reviled as hav- ing caused problems for humans in our ancient past, we're exceptionally adept, it seems to me, at talking out of both sides of our mouths! What strikes me as significant about all this is that however one chooses to look at these various references in the ancient writ- ings and records, even the book of Gen- esis in our own Christian Bible points to the snake as a reptilian influence-as a player in mankind's development of knowl- edge and ability. There are are other records which point to Adam and Eve-or should we say, \"first humans,\" as having unusual skin. Of course, we're all familiar with the story in Genesis, but there are other interesting sources as well. In Hebrew literature, there is the Haggadah, an ancient Jewish document which describes the consequences of Adam and Eve's (first humans) eating forbidden fruit as follows: \"The first result was that Adam and Eve became naked. Before, their bodies had been overlaid with a horny skin and envel- oped with the cloud of glory. No sooner had they violated the command given them than the cloud of glory and the horny skin dropped from them, and they stood there in their nakedness and ashamed.\" It would appear that they lost something, that something being described as a skin of some kind which we do not normally equate with our mammalian skin appear- ance. The Haggadah goes on to comment that Adam and Eve's clothing needs (that is, \"man's\" clothing needs) at this point in time were filled by making clothing from the skins sloughed off by serpents. Also the story makes the point that Adam and Eve (man) must now sweat, something serpents are not subject to, and Eve is consigned to bearing children-as a mammal bears children-the hard way. Certainly something to think about as we re-examine the \"Adam and Eve\" story and the many references to serpents in our own human heritage. Obviously, I've only touched on a few of the ancient sources which talk about reptilians in our past, mainly to make the point that reports of reptilians among us are nothing new, and that we may have a closer connection to them than we realize.

November 13 th 8:30 - 9:30 am Nick Redfern - UFO Crashes: An Illustrated History Nick Redfern is the author of 3 best-selling books on UFOs and spoke at last year's Crash-Retrieval conference on C/R incidents from the United Kingdom. This year, Nick will be providing the audience with a detailed, historical breakdown of the many and varied C/R cases that have been reported over the course of the last century and from throughout the world. As well as encompassing new data and summarizing some of the more well known cases such as Roswell, Aztec, Kecksburg and Kingman, Nick's lecture will cover both seldom-discussed and previously-unknown crashed UFO incidents from China, the former Soviet Union, Africa, South America, Germany, Australia and the United States. The lecture will demonstrate the sheer C/R reports on a global scale, their frequency and locations, and will provide the audience with a firm appreciation of probably the most important aspect of the UFO mystery. 9:35 - 10:35 am Jim Marrs â€” Aurora, Texas UFO Crash As an investigative journalist and author, Jim Marrs explores the crash details of April 19, 1897, when a slow moving space ship crashed into a windmill, bursting into pieces. As the debris was searched through, supposedly the body of a small alien was discovered. Some of the debris also revealed material sketched with a type of hieroglyphic. The town folk gave the poor little creature a proper burial in the local cemetery. Jim brings fresh information to this story and will provide startling new evidence. 10:50 - 11:50 am Don Ledger â€” The Shag Harbour Incident Don Ledger describes the Shag Harbour Incident in two parts. The first part involves the sighting, and then a witnessing of the entry or crash of an object into the waters adjacent to Shag Harbour on the southern tip of Nova Scotia on the night of October 4, 1967. There followed rescue attempts of a lighted object seen floating on the water by the RCMP and local fishermen, and the subsequent attempts by the authorities and the Canadian navy to find the object or traces of it on the bottom over a 4-day period. This part of the incident was in full view of the public and written about extensively in the daily newspapers. The second part unfolds over a period of 7 days and within a few hours of the incident at Shag Harbour when years later it is discovered that the object apparently made its way northeast some 23 miles to the mouth of Shelburne Harbour under the water and settled on offshore about 1.5 miles from a top-secret base at Government Point, it's true purpose not known until 21 years later. Canadian Forces Base, Shelburne was actually a United States Navy SOUSOS base established many years earlier during the early years of the Cold War. During the 7 day period six or seven naval vessels were stationed over the object which was on the bottom in about 80 feet of water. Divers were sent down to ascertain what it was and observe it and took photographs of not one but two objects, one of which appeared to be lending assistance to the other. The first part of the incident is heavily documented while the second part is anecdotal information received from Army, Navy and Air Force personnel who were present during that 7 day period. It is the second part of the Shag Harbour Incident that will be the focus of the speaker's presentation. 1:00 - 2:00 pm Peter Robbins â€” The Rendlesham Forest UFO Incident Twenty-four years after the fact, England's Bentwaters-Woodbridge UFO Incident (AKA the Rendlesham Forest Incident) still stands as the United Kingdom's seminal UFO event. While no serious allegations of a crash were involved, the Ministry of Defense and the United States Air Force's did what they could to downplay the events in question. Since the 1997 publication of the British best seller Left At East Gate by Larry Warren and Peter Robbins, Her Majesty's government has seen fit to release several hundred pages of documents, memos and letters pertaining to the events of December 1980. Other evidence supporting the book's accuracy has surfaced since then as well. In this compelling presentation, Peter will take us through the original incident, then review key updates in the case. Robbins, who will be fresh from a speaking and research tour of the United Kingdom, will present material not previously aired in this country. 2:05 - 2:35 pm Special Guest Speaker â€” To be announced www.ufoconference.com - www.majesticdocuments.com"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"The 2 nd Annual UFO Crash Retrieval Conference th Saturday. November 13 . continued 2:50 - 3:50 pm Linda Moulton Howe â€” UFO Crash Retrievals and America's Policy of Denial in the Interest of National Security For 25 years as a TV producer and investigative reporter, Linda Moulton Howe has sought the evidence that will answer the important question: What does the United States government actually know about entities and technologies from UFO crash retrievals which have provoked an American policy of misinformation and denial in the interest of national security, since at least 1947 while at the same time, the American government and corporations have back-engineered the very same alien technology they deny exists. In 2002, a microbiologist named Dan Burisch, Ph.D., came forward to whistleblow about his work for Majestic-12 and the MAJI Committee concerning an \"extraterrestrial biological entity\" at Area 51 S-4/5, Nellis AFB, which allegedly was retrieved from the May 20, 1953, Kingman, Arizona UFO crash. 3:55 - 4:55 pm (Part 1) Grant Cameron â€” The Presidents and the Hard Evidence In Part 1 of this 2-part talk, Grant Cameron will show that the U.S. president knew about hard UFO evidence such as crash retrievals right from the start, and that he took steps to cover up that evidence. He will discuss the Canadian government's involvement in the early days of Ufology, directed by Wilbert Smith who ran the official government investigation of flying saucers known as Project Magnet. Also discussed will be Smith's contact with the secret MJ-12 type group that controlled the most classified UFO evidence, and evidence that Smith was read into the crash retrieval program. Grant will talk about Arthur Lundahl, who was considered the preeminent intelligence officer of the 1950s. According to one CIA source, Lundahl briefed at least three presidents on the subject of UFOs. Grant will look at Lundahl's involvement in UFO hardware recovered in 1952 and his successful attempt to communicate with an alien in 1959, as well as Lundahl's connection to the present flood of UFO documents in the UFO community known as the Majestic Documents. 7:15 - 9:30 pm Banquet & Keynote Speech by Stephen Bassett - Truth Retrieval: A Message to the President Elect  * Eleven days after the 2004 presidential election, Stephen Bassett will give the conference Keynote. The politics of disclosure, exopolitics, and the requirements for REAL secrecy/intelliqence reform directly enqage issues which reside within the hidden core of an evolvinq governmental dysfunction which threatens the nation. The crash retrievals beqan in the 1940's; the cover-up followed. Six decades later, it is time for truth retrieval; and as of November 2, 2004, that becomes the iob of the President Elect.

His records of crash retrievals are extensively detailed in the eight documents easily available over 17 years (1977 book \"Situation Red-The UFO Siege\", and seven UFO Crash/Retrieval Status Reports, ending in 1994). A clear and accurate summary of what one can conclude from this large data base would be very welcome and this paper is aimed at being such a summary. There are multiple reports covering the apparently identical crash retrievals, and numerous subtle corroborating statements by unrelated witnesses. Witness crash reports cover at least 30 years. The bottom line will attempt to answer the question, \"How many crash retrievals actually occurred, and what are the implications for today?\" 10:05 - 11:05 am Paul Davids - The Road To Roswell: A Primer of Undisputed Facts and Factual Disputes In 1995 when President Clinton visited Ireland, a schoolboy at a press conference asked him whether aliens had really crashed at Roswell. The President replied: \"As far as I know, no spaceship crashed at Roswell, New Mexico, in 1947.\" The crowd roared with laughter. The network news didn't consider it worth broadcasting the rest of what the President said, which was: \"But if a spaceship did crash and aliens were recovered there, the Air Force hasn't told me about it, and I would like to know!\" Paul Davids wrote the President to tell him what the Air Force hadn't. Paul's father, Dr. Jules Davids, was Bill Clinton's Professor of U.S. Diplomatic History at Georgetown University in 1968, and Paul's letter and evidentiary materials got through to the President and received a response. But how, Paul asks, can any of us navigate through the morass of competing versions of \"The Truth\" in books and documentaries and government reports that are designed to shut off inquiry about the Roswell Incident and declare \"CASE CLOSED\"? How does one choose sides between authors and \"authorities\" who are at odds with one another - and who are at one another's throats? Paul will attempt to walk you through the minefield that every truth- seeker must traverse on the Road to Roswell, laying out the undisputed facts and the factual disputes, so that you will better understand why this case emerged for many as \"Ground Zero\" in the Great UFO Debate. www.ufoconference.com -- www.majesticdocuments.com"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"The 2 nd Annual UFO Crash Retrieval Conference th Sunday, November 14 . continued 11:10 - 11:40 am Special Guest Speaker â€” Title to be announced 12:50 - 1:50 pm Dr. David Pace - Inside the USSR Majestic 12 Program Dr. David Pace will discuss his experiences with the Soviet UFO Hierarchy, scientific-engineering and medical as well as governmental. First will be a discussion of the history and genesis of the USSR's analog to Majestic 12 program. The second part of the talk will encompass Soviet/Russian UFO crash retrievals and perspective on reverse science and engineering, along with his firsthand knowledge and experience with the Soviet analogues to America's Area 51. Specific examples of UFO crashes will be presented along with his insights about the reality of such events. Given Dr. Pace's experience, his insights into the USA - USSR coordination and communications around UFO events and technology constitute a true first in Ufology. 1:55 - 2:55 pm (Part 2) Grant Cameron â€” The Presidents and the Hard Evidence In Part 2 of this 2-part talk, Grant Cameron will discuss Lyndon Johnson and the role of the presidents in the post Project Blue Book era. The presidents who were briefed will be named, and those names will surprise some people. A key part of this presentation will be the role of President Richard Nixon in UFOs, and the importance of the \"Holloman Air Force Base film\" story that occurred during his administration. Grant will present many new facts about this fascinating story that have never been heard before, including a letter signed by President Nixon that could become one of the most significant UFO documents ever released. The presentation will also look at a major disclosure effort that was initiated during the Reagan administration to release UFO films and to familiarize the public with the story about a live alien recovered in a UFO crash retrieval. The Reagan administration was also the period when UFO documents started to leak into the UFO community. 3:10 - 3:40 pm Special Guest Speaker â€” Title to be announced Ryan Wood - Convenient Deaths in Support of UFO 3:45 - 4:45 pm Secrecy At first glance one might not think that murder would be necessary in the name of UFO secrecy, but in this talk Ryan Wood shows that the evidence suggests otherwise. A review of key deaths will be presented with details of how each person died and the probability against chance. There are famous figures including Oppenheimer, Einstein and possibly JFK, and lesser-known people such as virologist Robert Green and John Murphy, the Kecksburg, Pennsylvania UFO crash reporter.

A friend of mind (I'll call him Frank), someone I might describe as well-endowed with a psychic ability, was touring India in the 1960s. One day, as he stood watch- ing a snake charmer doing his thing, Frank found himself responding as the snake charmer challenged any in the audience to step forward and interact with the cobra. The snake charmer, of course, not hav- ing anticipating any response from the au- dience, hesitated, apparently fearing the outcome, but Frank persisted, and amid the murmur from the crowd, the snake was draped around Frank's shoulders. What did the snake do? Immediately the cobra swung its head around to within a few inches of Frank's face-and the two stared at one another, eye-to-eye for some period of time. After several seconds of silence (and one wonders at the level of communica- tion taking place) the cobra suddenly laid its head against Frank's cheek. And in the midst of the surrounding crowd's approval, the snake charmer exclaimed, \"Ah, you are one of us!!\" Obviously, of course, this incident says something about Frank, and it may also say something about the snake. Now, lest you conclude that I am, by telling of this incident, trying to paint a benign image of reptilian life, please con- sider this next incident, an incident related by Paul Brunton in a book of his own ex- periences, which was published in the 1930s. Brunton's book (which, by the way, is still available to be ordered in paperback) is entitled A Search in Secret Egypt. Brunton was an individual with an ex- ceptionally inquiring mind. For instance, he once spent a night alone in the Great Pyramid, which incident, alone, makes for interesting reading. But it's his experience with snakes I'd like to call to your atten- tion. Brunton, who was no snake lover, learned to handle and control poisonous snakes by allowing himself to serve as a student to a well-known Egyptian gentle- man at that time. He relates that several times when look- ing into a cobra's eyes, he felt that there was behind them an intelligence which was almost human, and that once when he had slung a particularly thick and exception- ally large specimen of a snake around his neck for a minute, he had experienced a sudden slipping away of his mind from its earthly surroundings, and that he found himself in a somewhat bewildering psy- chic state. This he did not relish, and he let the snake fall gently to the ground, and his consciousness reverted to normal. He wondered if he had sensed the snake's own state of consciousness. He says it happened only once, but was unforgettable. What I'm leading up to is the following incident. Brunton tells about a jungle expedition in the south of India where he unexpect- edly came upon a weird sight, nothing less than a meeting of cobras. A number of . them were gathered round in a clearing, their bodies raised majestically into the air as they faced one another in the circle. And Brunton wondered what they were discussing, what mysterious secrets they might be communicating to one another. In telling this story, he said that he had to admit that he was so disconcerted that he \"fled from the sight.\" In researching our past, I've come to realize that even if I think I can discount some of the legends and stories, I still have to admit the serpent as a heavily perceived presence in mankind's past in ancient cul- tures all over the planet. (Next month: modern encounters.) Group claims recovery of Tunguska ET device An unconfirmed report from what is described as \"the scientific expedition of the Siberian state foundation Tunguska Space Phenomenon\" claims that \"blocks of an extraterrestrial device which crashed down on Earth on June 30, 1908,\" have been recovered. Expedition members also reportedly found the so-called \"deer,\" which is the stone which eyewitnesses repeatedly men- tioned in their stories. A 50-kilogram piece of the stone is being analyzed. The well-known 'Tunguska event\" was some sort of aerial explosion, as opposed to a ground impact, that occurred near the Tunguska River in Siberia around 7 AM on June 30,1908. The explosion felled an estimated 60 million trees over a wide area, and caused biological mutations. Residents of the area reportedly ob- served a huge fireball, almost as bright as the Sun, moving across the sky before ap- parently exploding, creating a shock wave felt strongly 400 miles away, and which circled the Earth. Wildlife in the area were killed, and some of the animals which escaped the blast were covered with scabs. There has been an ongoing debate as to what caused the aerial blast: comet, aster- oid, or UFO. Director's Message (Continued from page 2) Paul Breakenridge, of Omaha, NE; Steven G. Paulson, of Mesa, AZ; and John M. Read, of Clovis, CA, have suc- cessfully passed the MUFON Field Investigator's Exam and are now MUFON Field Investigators. All Field Investigator Trainees are urged to study the MUFON Field Investigator'sManual 'and take the exam. The manual provides excellent guidelines for UFO investigations and reporting. It is available from MUFON Headquar- ters for $25 plus $3.50 p&h. The total price for delivery outside the U.S. is $38.50. The exam is available from MUFON Headquarters and is mailed free to trainees when their studies are com- pleted. Contribution to MUFON Archives We wish to thank CliffBarnes of Lady Lake, FL, for the contribution of a scrap- book of UFO clippings collected by his mother. Many of the clippings date back to a time before MUFON was formed so they are a nice addition to the archives. Eventually, these and all other news clippings will be scanned and digitized as a part of the MUFON Pandora Project. Call for Laboratory Analysis Capability The proper analysis of physical evi- dence in UFO cases is of utmost impor- tance to MUFON. Field investigators col- lect items of physical evidence as a part of their investigation. They package and document it and start the chain of custody that assures the evi- dence is not tampered with until it arrives at a laboratory and the chain of custody is handed over to the laboratory personnel for analysis and reporting. Inasmuch as we never know where evi- dence will be found, it is important to have a number of laboratories across the coun- try available to do the analytical work. While it would be nice to have a certified laboratory available in every state, that is not possible at this time due to the expense involved. This is a call to all MUFON members having access to laboratory capabilities to identify laboratories that will contribute the cost of their work in order to help solve the UFO mystery. MUFON is a non-profit corporation, and their contributions are tax deductible.

Reviewed by Dwight Connelly The UFO wave of 1966-67. which Hall calls \"the Mother of All UFO Waves, cre- ated quite a stir at the time. The mass media was impressed by the great number of reports, and even a few scientists sug- gested that the government should do more than dub the sightings as swamp gas (as   \\ did Dr. J. Allen Hynek, then an Air Force consultant, in March, 1967). Congressional hearings were held, and the Air Force set up the Colorado UFO Project in 1967 under Dr. Edward Condon, who indicated from the beginning that there was nothing to UFOs. Despite the interest generated by the 1966-67 wave, little changed, except perhaps Dr. Hynek, who gradually became one of the leading UFO investigators and proponents. This book was authored by one of the top UFO investigators of the past 50 years, so Hall's selection of cases is, as one would expect, excellent-not the \"lights in the sky\" variety. In the 1967 cases, for example, 31% in- volved occupant sightings, 48 % involved vehicle encounters, and 42% involved physical effects. Also included are radar tracking and photograph cases. Most came from the files of the National Investigations'Committee on Aerial Phe- nomena (NICAP), where Hall served as assistant director and acting director dur- ing this wave. A few cases came from newspaper re- ports, which,-as Hall points out, \"cannot be given the same weight as firsthand re- ports and reports that were carefully in- vestigated by qualified people,\" such as Raymond Fowler or Walter Webb. While most of the cases come from the 14 U.S., sightings from all over the world are included; In the back of this book are bar graph charts showing statistics from the 208 sightings in 1966 and the 579 sightings in 1967. These charts graphically illustrate such items as physiological effects, envi- ronmental illumination, light beam, vehicle encounter, satellite objects, occupants, time of day, and shape of object, all on a month by month basis. Additional charts show the regions of the country where the sightings occurred. The cases themselves are presented in chronological order, with perhaps four to eight cases per page. Several of the cases are illustrated with drawings. Nearly four decades have passed since the 1966-67 wave, and a look at these cases shows that the same types of sightings are still being reported. However, a compila- tion of sightings-over the past ten years would no doubt include a great many more occupant sightings, as .abductions have taken center stage. As Robert Swiatek notes in the Foreward, \"Yes, the phenomenon has changed, evolved with the years, but only to. further define what was already being seen. People now report being taken on board disc-or saucer-shaped-objects, and various types of entities are observed to emerge from them. The UFO field has an additive, not substitutive, nature.\" Witness to Roswell^ Tom Carey and Don Schmitt, 2003, Triton Group Publi- cations, P.O.

September 2004"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"co-author, Carol Rainey (Budd's wife), appears to be just as careful in presenting the scientific evidence. I have to wonder whether those calling for government disclosure would, after reading this book, still want the govern- ment to tell all. Still, we humans do want to know. Ann- Marie (one of the abductees described by Hopkins), after having learned at one point to read the strange alien symbols in a book provided by her abductors (a skill that she lost as soon as she read the material), re- sponded to what she recalled was the \"hor- rible\" subject matter by saying to the aliens, \"This is so terrible! You have to tell us about this....\" In explaining their purpose in writing this book, Hopkins and Rainey list two goals: (1) to \"alert open-minded members of the scientific community to the need to join in this crucially important investiga- tion.\" and (2) \"to provide enough specific information about the aliens' behavior on our planet to enable readers to form their own judgements about its intent and its future course.\" I'm not sure how much scientists can realistically add to the picture. It appears that ufologists have, with little direct help from scientists, come very close to explain- ing as much about the ah'ens as we are likely to know-short of some overt action by our abductors. Perhaps the authors are suggesting that scientists zero in on the physics of UFOs, including invisibility, and I know that Budd is very interested in getting medical doc- tors involved in documenting the physical effects reported in abductions-although several such cases have already been docu- mented by physicians. The basic procedure followed by the authors in co-writing this book is for Budd to present the actual cases, and for Carol to discuss recent scientific breakthroughs which suggest that in many of the cases the amazing feats attributed to the aliens are not so far from what our own scien- tists are now able to do. Sight Unseen is really two separate books, divided into two major sections. Unseen Part one, \"Unseen,\" explores what ap- pears to be the aliens' ability to not only make themselves invisible, but to make humans invisible as well. Several very interesting cases are de- scribed, including the strange experience of abductee and author Katharina Wilson in a Chicago airport when none of the restroom's automatic faucets would acti- vate for her, although they were working fine for other travelers. Other cases of in- dividuals who were seemingly invisible are also discussed. Seen Part two of the book, \"Seen,\" is the most interesting, however, as it deals with what are called hybrids or transgenic be- ings. The hybrids, of course, would be a mixture of hu- mans and aliens created by cross fertilization of sperm and eggs. Hopkins feels this is not as likely to occur, since there would probably be an incompatibility between humans and aliens which would cause such a combi- nation not to work-unless, of course, we and the aliens have a common background of some sort (such as organic seeds of life present in space, or some sort of alien in- volvement in mankind's creation or evo- lution). More likely, say the authors, aliens are using the transgenic process, whereby the DNA of humans is mixed with the DNA of the aliens. Since humans have already shown that genes can be transferred be- tween species, as with the sheep-goat mix- ture, the monkey-jellyfish, and fish-straw- berries, this process is not beyond our present science. The authors note that \"if the foreign DNA is stably integrated into the host ge- nome, the 'transgene' can be expressed in the transgenic animal and passed in the gametes to future generations... .And it can change the genome of an entire species in a condensed amount of timeâ€”without be- ing visible in the exterior traits of the ani- mal.\" Testimony by abductees suggest, how- ever, that the breeding experiments are not always successful, sometimes resulting in pitiful-looking misshapen creatures that only a mother could loveâ€”and in some reported cases, not even the mother. The authors suggest that perhaps there is improvement from generation to genera- tion. Or perhaps some aliens know how to do it, and some don't. Hopkins and Rainey point out that, like our own scientists, aliens would likely want to study the effects of what they are doing by using the same experienced individual (animal or human) for a period of time, as well as to study the effects from one gen- eration to another-which fits with reports of multiple abductions of the same indi- An apology to our readers /<?tf/7Ztf/readers should have had access to a review of Sight Unseen much earlier, and normally we do receive books as soon as they are published-or, in some cases, as galleys even before they are published. In this case, effective communications never seemed to get established, despite efforts on our part to contact the various parties involved. Finally, at the MUFON Symposium in July, Budd Hopkins personally provided the editor with a copy of the book, aplogizing for the communications break- down. We appreciate Budd's concern, and thank him for taking care of the problem as soon as he was aware of it. vidual, as well as multi-generation abduc- tions being the norm. In addition, the use of implants has been suggested as a method of monitoring indi- viduals between abductions. Hopkins and Rainey note the following statistics: \"If, as a 1991 Roper Poll on 'Unusual Personal Experiences' suggests, there are an estimated two percent of Americans (approximately four million people) who have had experiences consis- tent with those of the abduction phenom- enon, the scope of the aliens' apparent ge- netic mission is staggering.\" They add, \"The UFO occupants' am- biguity, their elusiveness in being catego- rized, and their profound secretiveness are strokes of genius. In this way, they have all the control in terms of our relationship to them. These same qualities offer our alien visitors the perfect opportunity to slip between the two mighty cultural rocks of human religion and secular science. \"They slide right through our nets, evade both our old and new systems, pass by our understanding, and go quickly, ef- ficiently, about their business-without full disclosure, without permission, and with- out official public acknowledgement that something significant is happening to us as a species.\" Mr. Paige Of the many cases discussed, a couple are especially interesting. One involves a woman, Ann-Marie (mentioned earlier), an abductee who grew up with a strange, gentle \"handyman,\" Mr. Paige, living in the family's household for a period of sev- eral years. She first remembers him when she was about three years old when the odd-look- ing (like the wizard of Oz) Mr. Paige would take her on walks to a special cow pasture. These walks were enjoyable for SEPTEMBER 2004 MUFON UFO JOURNAL 15"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"Ann-Marie as they examined the plants and animals, and Mr. Paige was special to her as she rode on his shoulders and enjoyed his company. He had simply appeared at their home one day looking for work, with no refer- ences, no drivers license, nothing. Yet he was trusted to take Ann-Marie on long unsupervised walks, something that puzzles Ann-Marie's mother even now, since she was normally very protective of the child. Over the years Mr. Paige never seemed to age, and periodically he would disap- pear for a time, always refusing rides to the bus station when he left. While away, he would write letters to Ann Marie, but they were difficult to read because of their poor construction, punctuation, and gram- mar, although he appeared educated when he spoke. It was as though he had learned to speak English, but not to write it very well. His letters were always typed, and where there were gaps in the sentences he would place strange symbols. Hopkins notes that these appear simi- lar to symbols reported by other abductees. The symbols were also like those that Ann- Marie was shown in a book presented to her (temporarily) by aliens during an ab- duction. This was the book with the horrible ma- terial (mentioned earlier) that Ann Marie could read briefly, but then could neither read nor remember exactly what she had read. Even more strange, Mr. Paige seemed able to read Ann-Marie's thoughts through some sort of telepathy while he was away. Or, as the authors suggest, perhaps he had access to an implant strategically placed in Ann-Marie. Mr. Paige never wanted his photo taken, and the one time that Ann-Marie managed (through extensive begging) to get a photo of him with her, the photo and his letters later mysteriously disappeared. Under hypnosis, Ann-Marie cheerfully described Mr. Paige and their trips to the cow pasture, but then as they arrived at the cow pasture she paused and began to cry softly. At that point Hopkins asked her if she wanted to stop the hypnosis, and she said yes, which they did. It seemed that something had occurred at the cow pasture that Ann-Marie did not want to relive, and Hopkins feels that hyp- nosis should not be used to bring up a prob- lem where none exists. Ann-Marie is certain that Mr. Paige never sexually abused her, which suggests that something else, perhaps abductions, occurred at the cow pasture. 16 Was the handyman who Ann Marie adored actually a hybrid or transgenic who prepared her as gently as possible for her abductions? Judging by the way she has handled the abuctions, compared with other abductees, her relationship with Mr. Paige may indeed have made her \"the luckiest little abductee,\" says Hopkins. Damoe Still another case involving a mysteri- ous stranger was that of \"Will\" and \"Damoe.\" Damoe was a young man who looked very much like one of Will's sons, and who seemed to just suddenly appear at Will's farm. Will assumed he was some- one staying at a neighboring farm. Among the strange occurrences involv- ing Damoe, Will discovered his watch was missing, only to have it mysteriously found and returned by Damoe. Budd observes that this \"is part of a curious pattern that I have noticed with several abductees. In these cases, personal, cherished objects-a wedding ring, a favorite bracelet, a par- ticular item of clothing-seems to vanish and then reappear under highly unusual cir- cumstances.\" But more to the point in this case, Will's wife had suffered a mental breakdown, which Will suspected had something to do with a strange incident on their farm. He had seen three black, unmarked he- licopters (\"They was not saucer-shaped in any form. They was helicopters,\" he told Hopkins.) hovering over a nearby field where his wife was resting after helping him harvest hay. The helicopters seemed to land near where Will's wife was resting, so he rushed to the area. When he arrived, there were no helicopters, but he had not seen them leave. When he asked his wife about them, she said somewhat groggily, \"What heli- copters?\" He thought that even if she had been napping, the helicopters would surely have awakened her. Looking back, he also felt that there may have been missing time con- nected with the incident. Hypnotic regression on Will revealed a very different scenario from what he con- sciously recalled. Instead of helicopters, there were saucer-shaped craft. As Will started to investigate, Damoe appeared, telling Will that everything was okay. Will ran to where his wife was, spot- ting her lying on a wagon, naked. He re- ports, \"There are about six people....! bump into one and he goes flying... .1 jump onto the wagon....! grab the chain....I'm swinging it over my head.. .1 know these people. I've seen 'em before....I'm screamin'. MUFON UFO Journal \"Damoe says, 'Will, put your weapon away. You may hurt yourself or your mate. We did not want you to do this. We merely wanted you to witness what has taken place. We did not want you to be angry.' \"They're doing some of the same things to her they' ve done to me....\" Other enti- ties tell Will to stop, and he feels he has to obey. Eventually a long needle is placed in the wife's navel, and she is crying. This episode will emerge later in her nightmares, and seems instrumental in her eventual mental breakdown. The main point of this case, however, is Damoe. Is he a hybrid or transgenic? Since he looks so much like one of Will's sons, is there a physical relationship be- tween Will and Damoe? This case, like others, suggests that transgenics, if Damoe is one, often do not have a complete idea of human emotions. Damoe could not understand why Will was angry. Also, his referring to Will's wife as a \"mate\" seems to be a somewhat un- usual and stilted use of language. There are several other cases in this fas- cinating book which provide a strong ar- gument for hybrids among us. What is not provided is an answer to the question of what the aliens are up to. Dr. David Jacobs, another reliable re- searcher and a colleague and friend of Hopkins, suggested in The Threaf.thai his studies of abductees indicate that the aliens are conducting a breeding program de- signed to ultimately take over the Earth. Hopkins and Rainey have not reached this conclusion, but likewise do not dis- miss this scenario. In any case, it is clear that the aliens have a great deal of power. Evidence indicates that at least some (perhaps all) of them can make themselves, their saucers, and their abductees invisible; can move through solid walls with their prey; can screen themselves and their sau- cers to appear to be something else (heli- copters, military, deer); can immobilize witnesses; can harm individuals (acciden- tally or intentionally); can steal fetuses; can cause memory loss; and can infiltrate our society as hybrids or transgenics. If our government does decide to ac- knowledge what is known about the aliens, officials will have a difficult job explain- ing it in a manner that will avoid panic, hopelessness, and chaos. I would think that any such disclosure would have to begin with the basics, such as, yes, we have tracked UFOs and believe they are real. It would take a considerable period of acclimation before the general public would be ready for the advanced material in this excellent book-if ever.

The object was high up, but they could tell it was tubular, with- out wings or tail. The object was moving northwest to southeast. After about a minute it passed by a jet fly- ing east to west at a higher elevation. The jet made a complete turn and flew in the same direction as the object, and seemed to be chasing it. So they got their binoculars. The witness states, \"Sure enough this three-lighted thing with the lights rotating flew over our heads at about 1,000 feet, heading northwest to southeast. I used to fly airplanes, and this whole thing was re- ally weird, so I called up my Mom, who was driving home and was located between Lacrosse and Sparta. She also saw a craft that got her attention because it seemed to have no wings.\" Thanks to Peter Davenport, Director, www.UFOCenter.com. Illinois bright light CHICAGO - Around 1 AM on July 25, 2004, the observer was sitting on his back porch and noticed a thick cloud with a pul- sating and flashing light coming from it. He continued to watch, and knew it wasn't lightning or a star or anything nor- mal. There was no sound. He kept looking and saw eight to nine objects in perfect alignment with one an- other circling the main light that was pul- sating from the thick cloud. These smaller objects flew into the lighted area and disappeared. After three minutes the cloud wasn't there either! Thanks to Peter Davenport. Car stalls in New York Two friends were driving in the moun- tains in upstate New York on July 22, 2004, around 2 AM. They pulled the car off the highway in a heavily wooded area to take a break. They got out of their car, but left the headlights on because it was very dark. They heard a strange humming sound, which was not a typical humming sound. As the humming got louder, the car's head- lights started dimming and went off. The witnesses started freaking out at this point. They jumped back in the car and at- tempted to start it. The car wouldn't start. They were somewhat frantic. After about ten minutes the car's lights suddenly went back on and they were able to start the car. The witness states, \"That's when we no- ticed this lemon-shaped light in the sky that just sort of drifted for a minute and the strange noise stopped, and I have no idea what it was, but I'm never going upstate again!\" Thanks to Peter Davenport. California disc HANFORD - Three roommates ob- served a red-tinted spinning dome-shaped object hovering in the sky at 2 AM on July 22, 2004. The disc had a white pulsating light emanating from it, and made no sound. The witness states, \"It was spinning rap- idly, yet it wasn't moving much. After about ten minutes it slowly began moving away from us. \"During this time we noticed aircraft scrambling from the Lemoore Naval Base towards the object. Within the next ten minutes we lost sight of it. The total dura- tion of the sighting was twenty minutes.\" Thanks to Peter Davenport. Solomon Islands UFOs In the June-July issue of NEXUS Magazine, Sri Ramon Jun Quitales II wrote a Letter to the Editor inquiring, \"Could anyone provide information of the UFO activity on Makira Island.\" Other people living on the Solomon Islands have reported heavy UFO activity and sighting unusually large people wearing grey uni- forms. The UFOs are flat sting-ray type craft with large round lights on the bottom. They reportedly dive in and out of the water over known deep areas of lagoons. Thanks to Sky watch International New Zealand egg-shaped object In the afternoon of July 21, 2004, the observer was looking up in the sky and saw a disc-shaped craft flying over. Later that night at 11:30 PM, he was looking through a telescope and saw a bright cream col- ored light. He and his friend looked out and saw a hovering disc-shaped craft with rock-like projectiles on the outside surface. They saw a neon blue beam shine into their pad- dock. They ran out into the paddock. He states, \"Then the rocks started fall- ing, so we ran back to the house, and then there was a big flash, then that's all I re- member about that night. \"The next morning, I went out to check up on the calves, and there were slaugh- tered heifers scattered on the ground. The craft made a sound like a chainsaw cutting through a log, and it gave a magnetic ef- fect on all metals in a 100-meter vicinity, including our barbed wire fence.\" Thanks to Peter Davenport. New Jersey disc SURF CITY - I was notified person- ally concerning this sighting from a pro- fessional who has long denied the possible existence of UFOs. She was talking with a group of friends at 1 AM in a gazebo overlooking the Atlantic Ocean, on Aug. 1, 2004. She looked out over the ocean and to the left of the full moon and noticed a large disc-shaped object with three rings of lights, one above the other running paral- lel to each other. Each row of lights had about 20 lights similar to a commercial air- craft surrounding what seemed to be a disc. The craft was flying to the north of her location towards the Barnegat Lighthouse. The disc wobbled as it descended on a SEPTEMBER 2004 MUFON UFO JOURNAL 17"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"maneuvering course towards the light- house. The craft appeared quite large, and had multiple parallel lights similar to a three- decked ship. Many similar UFO reports have accumulated through the years, and a book was written concerning these sightings. The sighting is notable by this witness, since she has always strongly ridi- culed the concept of UFOs in the past. California changing object SAN JOSE - It was around noon, and the witness was traveling north on Saratoga Avenue on July 17, 2004, when he saw a bright shiny object. There were several aircraft flying above San Jose along with the shiny UFO that was moving very slowly at first, giving the impression that it may be hovering. The object suddenly moved rapidly, and then slowed to a standstill. The witness got out of his car to observe as the shiny ob- ject flew slowly southeast. The witness, who was wearing sunglasses, described the object: \"It was like three bright shiny bal- loons or spheres connected together that seemed to change shape and reflect the sun's light or emit a bright white light.\" It took the shape of a triangle, and then changed to form a cylinder shape. Two minutes passed and the object quickly as-' cended going east. Thanks to Peter Dav- enport.   ~^j-. Greenland ice melting quickly The Scotsman reports, Greenland's cover of ice is melting ten times quicker than previously thought, an increase that could lead to floods across the world, sci- entists have found. Newly published research shows an alarming rise in the rate of collapse of the massive Greenland ice-sheet as a result of global warming. Scientists now believe the ice-sheet is shrinking at the rate of ten meters a year, not the one meter previously thought. If the entire ice-sheet melts, the result- ing flood waters would raise the level of global seas by seven meters (22 feet), sub- merging large areas of land, including sea- level cities such as London/ Greenland has the biggest ice-sheet in the northern hemisphere: almost 772,000 square miles of ice which is up to 1.9 miles thick, the base of which is below sea level. New Jersey disc EDGEWATER - The witness was riding in a car with his friend along Water Street, and reports seeing a curved UFO on July 17,2004, after noticing four lights 18 in the sky. \"Basically, it was a little curved circle with four lights, while two lights were on each curved side,\" he says. \"These four lights attracted me, because they constantly had a little vibration, which is very impos- sible for an aircraft or a bug. And the light vibration with those four lights flew in a curved shape from left to right.\" Thanks to Peter Davenport. New Jersey objects BOUND BROOK - The two objects flew from the right to the left, stopped for about ten seconds, and then flew slowly on July 17, 2004, at 12:30 PM. The witness was out looking at the stars through a pair of binoculars, and saw a satellite. Then two white disc-shaped UFOs went across the sky about halfway and stopped for about ten seconds before leaving. He states, \"There was a screech that sounded really weird, and the two crafts were too slow for it to be a comet, aster- oid, or a plane.\" It was in a clear sky. Thanks to Peter Davenport. Ohio circular objects PORTSMOUTH - It started with one white circular object that came out of al- most nowhere and dropped above a tree on July 17, 2004, at 10:45 PM. The object(s) moved effortlessly, and one came very close to the ground, hovered, and emit- ted beams. The others just seemed to float by. The tree is probably 30 feet high, and the craft hovered about 20 feet above that. It sent down four beams of light to the street, and just stayed there. The witness states, \"My girlfriend and I noticed darker squares or rectangles to- wards the middle of the circle, and after hovering with no noise for about 20 sec- onds it lifted slowly, then bolted out of sight. \"A triangular shape also came into fo- cus that was a pulsing red color. When it got closer it turned bright white. We saw about 15 of these that came from the south- east. Five of the craft seem to flow back and forth and change altitudes. The other ten just flew straight. \"They were red at first, and proceeded to change to white. I tried to put it off as a helicopter, but it just didn't seem right. All the triangles were changing from red to white. There were also small dark squares or rectangles. We called the local police, and guess what. The craft stopped com- ing, so the police thought we were crazy.\" Thanks to Peter Davenport. MUFON UFO Journal Disappearing lights in Iowa SIOUX CITY - \"On July 25, 2004,\" says the witness, \"we first saw a solid bright light, coming from the north, trav- eling quickly. It was a solid light until it got above us, then it stopped and was flash- ing, or it moved away. It was really high. \"Then we saw about six more lights. One of them looked like a cop car in space, circling the sky. All of the others ended up disappearing also, but not as dramatically as the first one.\" Thanks to Peter Daven- port. Huge object fills sky HOUSTON-The witnesses state, \"We were driving east down memorial drive at 6:30 PM between Kirkwood and Dairy Ashford when my daughter and I saw a huge object in the sky on July 25,2004. \"It had to have been larger then a foot- ball field. It was white on top and light gray on the bottom. It was rectangular shaped, but the top was kind of rounded. Not like anything I have ever seen before. \"It was pretty far away, but it was huge. Probably five times bigger then any plane I have seen in the sky. It was also com- pletely motionless. We turned back around to look again because some trees got in the way, biit it was gone.\" Thanks to Peter Davenport. Numerous orbs in Arizona PHOENIX - The witness reports, \"I have noticed for the last month or so that around 1 PM I have been seeing the same orbs at or around the same exact area in downtown Phoenix on Saturdays. \"Well, July 24, 2004, today, was no exception...It is a clear day today and the winds are coming in at a constant 10-15 MPH from the south. I went to the roof of my parking garage six floors up and spot- ted a white orb that.was heading northeast about 10 MPH at 1,500 feet high. \"I called a friend and described to him what I saw, when out of nowhere the ob- ject came back and headed in my direc- tion. I videotaped this, and noticed it was going southwest against the wind and de- scending at a slow rate. \"I saw two strings of orbs float down near the other object. There were eight to ten objects in each bunch. They were multi- colored with reds, white, orange, and blue, and there was a distortion around the ob- jects like they were under water in the sky. \"At first it was really hard to focus, then I finally got in on them and they were changing shapes and colors and barely moving, kind of meandering in the general area. They were starting to go through a September 2004"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"thin haze, and I couldn't focus in on them anymore. \"The sighting started about 1:15, and I couldn't see them anymore by 1:50 AM. These are the weirdest objects I have ever seen. They were side by side the whole time as if shadowing each other.\" California light LOS ANGELES - The witness re- ports, \"It was around 11 PM, on July 23, 2004, and there was a red and white blink- ing light in the sky that flew from one place to another quickly. It was circling around the night sky until it flew higher and van- ished. It was very small and very high up and continued to circle around and around very slowly. \"I kept on looking at it until it just went higher and higher into the sky until I could no longer see it.\" Thanks to Peter Daven- port. California orbs AUBURN - The witness says, \"On Aug. 6,2004, at 6:55 PM local time I wit- nessed three orbs of light coming out of the setting sun. I quickly got out my bin- oculars, which I carry with me, and was able to track and view the last of the three orbs. \"It was translucent, yet very white and bright. It was constantly changing shape, going from circular to a dodecahedron shape with star or pointed-like protrusions coming out of the circumference, and then back to circular. \"All three orbs passed over me at great speed. They looked like about 15,000 feet in altitude, and after passing over me they disappeared. One made a 90-degree turn to its left in an instant, then traveled for approximately an inch at my arm's length and disappeared rapidly.\" Mark A. Olson, D.M. Washington triangles TROUT LAKE - James Gilliland re- ports, \"We have had almost a week of con- stant activity with as many as 13 eyewit- nesses at a time. Several ships came in very low and expanded into a brilliant light. Some side slipped back and forth, chang- ing speeds and exhibiting behavior unlike any conventional craft. \"There was a triangle on Aug. 6 around 10:30 PM which swooped down, banked, and turned upward like a ghost ship. It was a bit larger than my hand. Two out of thir- teen saw it. It happened very quickly. On Aug. 8 at 9:50 PM, a ship came in low from the southeast. It burst into a bril- liant golden light, dimming to orange, then SEPTEMBER 2004 white. It continued northwest and repeated the signal, yet this time it was brilliant white like a welding arc. Three witnesses were present. The skies are getting busier.\" Georgia sphere ATLANTA - The witness reports, \"This sighting was similar to my encoun- ter a few days ago, only that each craft moved in completely different directions. The first one was a star-like looking ob- ject with a one-second interval flash very similar to the fourth craft I saw a few days ago. \"It moved fairly slow from south to north. The second one was identical, with- out a flash, and moved from west to east. The third was identical in appearance, ex- cept it moved freely wherever it wanted. It started from the south and strayed towards the northwest, zigzagging a few limes. \"This time my girlfriend was with me as opposed to my last encounter. She wit- nessed two of the three craft. I'm sure it's still continuing because I saw three within ten minutes at 9:50 PM on July 23,2004.\" Thanks to Peter Davenport. Florida discs in hanger U. S. AIR FORCE BASE (UNIDEN- TIFIED) - The Air Force witness claims that he met an airman in North Dakota when he was based there in 1970 who told him that his uncle, who owned a drill com- pany in Florida, was asked by USAF to come to the base with the best drills he had. He was taken to a hanger on one of the air bases, and there were three saucer-like craft inside. He was asked to drill into one of them, and he tried with his best equip- ment. He said, \"He drilled in one spot for about 15 minutes, and there was no sign of any marks where the drill had been working. No heat or color change, no noth- ing. I never saw the airman again.\" Thanks to Peter Davenport. Note: Numerous similar stories were told to me while I was on active duty in the Air Force whenever I would ask about UFOs. I met several maintenance person- nel who claimed they were given pieces of metal with hieroglyphics on them from al- leged alien craft to drill or cut. Even though the metal was very light and bendable, it was virtually indestructible. Washington spheres KIRKLAND - \"This is day two,\" says the witness. \"My wife and I saw the same spherical object moving in the sky at about 60,000 feet altitude on July 20, 2004, at 7:30 PM. Yesterday, we saw three objects. After three or four minutes, we saw the MUFON UFO JOURNAL original silver sphere moving west like the previous day. I called my wife to come out, and she also saw the sphere. \"We got out binoculars to see it better and magnified the silver sphere. It was probably a little smaller than a jet flying at about 40,000 feet. This time we didn't see any other objects like we did yester- day flying around it. \"Then it blinked out and was gone. There was no high cloud cover this time like there was the day before. I think the odds of seeing this thing twice in two days is really strange. The objects from the day before moved in odd directions around it and changed direction and speed. This main sphere kept the same course during both sightings.\" Thanks to Peter Davenport. Argentina UFO filmed COMODORO RIVADAVIA - A resi- dent of Comodoro Rivadavia filmed an unidentified flying object (UFO) over Cerro Chenque July 16, 2004. Marcelo Soto claimed the object apparently rested on that mountain, and he was able to record it from his home. \"The film shows a phenomenon that is very similar to the one seen in recent days over Buenos Aires. Marcelo Soto states, \"The image captured is unedited, and from the center of the luminous sphere, which changes colors, it can be seen how other lights emerge from within. The object ap- proached and receded, and lights came out of the center of the circle toward the side. That's when I got scared.\" Translation (c) 2004. Scott Corrales, Institute of Hispanic Ufology. England UFOs chased ILFORD, ESSEX - Lisa Sable called from London to tell me that while in school as an eleven-year-old in 1980, she and her class of 20 mates saw a huge craft hovering above a football pitch of about 15 acres next to their school. The huge craft was also seen by their professor, a rabbi. After ten minutes of watching and disrup- tion of the class they moved to another room. Thanks to Lisa Sable Pennsylvania disc ALLENTOWN - The witnesses were at Dorney Park on July 29, 2004; and at 4 PM took photos of a helicopter flying by with their digital camera. Later, when they looked at the photo there was a disc-like object next to the helicopter. The witness claims, \"Prior to taking the picture-even while taking it-I saw nothing except the copter, but it is in the picture.\" Thanks to Peter Davenport. 19"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"By Jenny Randies Jenny Randies Getting from there to here One of the things that has always fasci- nated me is how UFOs, assuming that they are flying machines (and I don't assume that, by the way!), might get here. The usual thought is that they are space- craft and so they-being the alien crew-pi- lot the thing across the cosmos just like we might take a hop in a small craft to the moon and back. Yet, there are evident problems with this. The difficulties include the modest (in galactic terms) speed of light, and the limits imposed in travel across vast universal distances. Indeed, even with the complications of time dilation making journeys relatively shorter, intergalactic travel is nothing like as straightforward as it seems to be on Star Trek. Hence there is always a get out clause for those skeptics suggesting that UFOs cannot be alien spacecraft because we do not yet know how to get here to there. Frankly, that is irrelevant. All that mat- ters is if it is theoretically possible, since, if it is, then someone, somewhere might have already achieved it. Indeed, given the vastness of the cosmos, must surely have already done so. Unfortunately, we do not know if such a thing is theoretically possible. As our knowledge of physics stands, there are huge problems envisaging how any mate- rial object can be accelerated beyond the speed of light. And in the absence of usable shortcuts, such as wormholes, faster-than-light travel would be essential for any kind of credible intergalactic travel to be occurring. Unless, by pure chance, two advanced species hap- pen to live next door to one another, in ga- lactic terms. This might have fostered a spacefaring mentality. A way out However, there is a way out, and it has become evident to me as I have been work- 20 ing on a book unrelated to UFOs. We have already achieved something else that Star Trek has been dreaming about- teleportation. In the late 1990s the first simple experi- ments were carried out in which energy was \"beamed\" a short distance across the lab. These have gradually escalated, and research teams in the US, in Europe, and in Australia had all by 2004 successfully teleported small packets of energy-such as light-across small distances. It is not difficult to imagine being able to do this through greater ranges, and to up the size of the things being \"beamed.\" These experiments work because of dis- coveries that we have made in the field of quantum mechanics and a property known as \"entanglement.\" This basically seems to show that there are intricate links at the smallest level of cosmic matter where you can alter^some- thing at one point and an entangled twin particle, maybe way out there across the universe, will respond in tune. It actually makes no difference at all how far away this other particle is. Dis- tance is of no consequence in these mat- ters.  I Indeed there are fascinating parallels between what happens in this research and the claimed experiences of twin humans who seem to have parallel feelings, emo- tional responses, and even life events that match one another even if they are not lo- cated anywhere close together. At its tiniest level, reality may be simi- larly twinned, making all things related in some incredibly intimate fashion. Beam me up The teleportation experiments carried out so far are very crude, and we are a long way from any kind of attempt to beam large things across space, let alone human beings. Some researchers are talking about sending things such as microscopic bacte- ria from one point to another, but even that is not imminent. Another thing to bear in mind is that this process is not like sending something by Fed Ex. You do not get a package, turn it into atoms, and then reconstruct this at the far end of its journey. In fact what hap- MUFON UFO Journal pens is more like photocopying. The atoms that create the teleported energy are in no way those being deconstructed. It is like taking a piece of paper with a message on it, sending that message, and creating it ut- terly anew on a completely different sheet of paper. Nobody knows what would happen if it were possible to beam a human. Would we create a clone, or would the real you some- how be sent as a wave of energy to inhabit new atoms? It is a very complex set of questions. However, what is apparent is that sci- ence is making great strides towards be- ing able to achieve teleportation above and beyond the remarkable experiments of these pioneer years. A new way of transporation has been discovered, and suddenly there is a completely different way of looking at the issue of how anyone might get from here to there (or in alien terms, from there to here!) We might look again at some of the evi- dence for close encounters and see how often the reported propulsion of a UFO is not as obvious as pressing a button, firing a motor, and climbing into the sky on a long trip homeward. Rather the data is full of weird events, including instant appearance and disap- pearance, shimmering hazes, strange alter- ations to the nature of light, energy or mag- netic fields in the immediate presence of the encounter, and various other clues that suggest something exotic might be going on. All of this may lead us nowhere, but it is surely worth contemplating the possi- bility that UFOs are not space travelling in any sense that we can envisage, but lit- erally beaming themselves from A to B. Where ever A or B are! Brazilian astronaut joins UFO Magazine board St. Col.

Institute, Mountain View, CA Dear Seth: I had been very pleased when I was in- formed that you had finally agreed to ap- pear with me on the Coast to Coast Radio Show with George Noory on June 22, 2004. Naturally I was disappointed when you developed pneumonia and the debate was postponed until July 21. But I thought it would at least give you extra time to do some homework about UFOs. It was perfectly clear from your books Cosmic Company and Shared Uni- rerses, and then your three lec- tures on the Queen Eliza- beth 2 (QE 2) in December, 2003, that you apparently knew almost nothing about UFOs. I must say you were in denial the entire show. Not only did you not provide any evidence of any kind that there are ET transmitters broadcasting either radio or optical signals that we can detect, but your ignorance about UFOs was readily appar- ent. You may recall that the late Graham Birdsall in his cover story about you in UFO Magazine noted that I had suggested that the best meaning for SETI would be Silly Effort To Investigate. I refrained from using the phrase during the show to be po- lite. In retrospect, I wish I had, since you provided so many examples of silliness rather than science. Let me be specific. You demanded my best evidence, sounding like you wanted it in 50 words or less... even though you had provided NO evidence regarding ET transmitters. I noted that there were five large-scale scientific studies, which I discussed in some detail on the QE 2, including astrono- SEPTEMBER 2004 mer J. Allen Hynek's The UFO Experi- ence. I Pointed out that there were 5,000 physical trace cases from 75 countries as collected by researcher Ted Phillips. I referred to multiple witness radar-vi- sual cases as researched in detail by the late Dr. James E. McDonald. Jim was a professor of physics at the University of Arizona. His specialty was atmospheric physics, which surely ought to be relevant to a serious scientific investigation of UFOs. Most sightings that can't be explained occur within the atmosphere. Jim had talked to more than 500 witnesses. His 71 - page congressional testimony, which I had given you. reviewed 41 outstanding cases. Several involved multiple witness RA- DAR-VISUAL situations, including trained flight crews in the sky and highly trained ground radar operators communi- cating with the sky crews. Your silly response on the air was that \"radar can be mistaken.\" And Barry Bonds sometimes strikes out. So? Does that mean these cases can be ignored? Yes, the very great majority of stars are not black holes. Does that mean none are? Barry Bonds does indeed hit many home runs. I am afraid you struck out on the show. I talked about physical trace cases, spe- cifically Delphos, KS, on the QE 2.1 had visited the site, and had lab tests done on soil from the affected ring and a control sample from nearby. I showed slides of these on the QE 2, noting the absence of moisture absorption by the ring soil and absence of seed ger- mination in the ring soil which had been dried out down 14\" in a ring about a foot wide and 10' in outer diameter. Your silly response after I said that the saltiness of the affected soil (mineral level too high) was too great to permit plant growth was that the farmer could have poured a bucket of salt water on the soil in a ring. Just as silly was your comment that clay doesn't absorb moisture either. As the slide showed, the ring soil was clearly NOT clay. There was, of course, no basis for either of your silly responses. About Roswell, for reasons unknown (though probably because the same silly comment was made in Phil Plait's recent MUFON UFO JOURNAL article in Sky and Telescope], you sug- gested it was obviously ridiculous to sug- gest a space craft could travel here hun- dreds of trillion miles and then crash. I had to point out that there wasn't the slightest reason to suggest that the same small craft that crashed near Roswell and out in the Plains of San Agustin had just flown on their own from Zeta Reticuli or any other star system. The Shuttle has had a few mishaps de- spite its high cost. Does the word aircraft carrier ring a bell? We dropped a lot of cruise missiles and bombs in Iraq last year that originated from nearby bases or from aircraft carriers (nuclear powered at that) very much closer than the United States and very much larger than the cruise mis- siles which were not nuclear powered. As I noted, there are many outstanding cases of huge unidentified \"mother\" ships being observed. The Yukon case, to which I referred, involved testimony from more than 30 witnesses. In independent groups of two or three, Martin Jacek, a civil engineer, was able to triangulate, based on their first-hand testi- mony. The ship was between 0.6 and 1.2 miles long. The Canadian Airlines International crew saw on their radar an object estimated at 5 or 6 times the size of a 747, moving at 5,400 miles per hour, according to their radar. They reported it. The captain and crew of a Japan Air Lines 747 observed a flying craft twice the size of an aircraft carrier. It was observed on their radar and by government radar on the ground. They were given permission to fly in a circular course. The craft sta- tion kept with them. There is an FAA file. The case has been carefully investigated in detail by Dr. Bruce Maccabee, an opti- cal physicist, and Dr. Richard Haines, now retired from NASA Ames. Both have written books about UFOs. Too bad you couldn't be bothered reading them. Incidentally, a UFO skeptic claimed that what was observed by the JAL crew were Jupiter and Mars! Pretty neat trick for Mars and Jupiter to station keep in a circle with a 747 and to be observed by aircraft and normal ground radar.

At first you suggested that they were too close to each other for there to be stable planetary orbits. I pointed out they are 9,000 AU apart, not the 1000 usually thought of as making it tough to have stable planetary orbits. Then you pointed out that no planets had been found around either one. Shouldn't you have added that with the currently available methods for inferring the exist- ence of planets, only the existence of very large planets (unlike Earth) can be inferred. You have no proof that any planets have been observed in other solar systems. Their existence depends on evaluation of data. You don't have a piece of one. Where is your best evidence?? You are very well aware that the his- tory of astronomy is loaded with eventu- ally-shown-to-be-false claims about many things, such as the age and size of the gal- axy and universe, the presence of water on Mars, the tropical paradise at Venus, etc. I still don't see why you do not under- stand that having another solar system more than 30 times closer than we do that there would be more incentive for inter- stellar travel. With a billion-year headstart and the ability to directly observe planets around the other one, of course there would be more incentive, and a long time ago at that. You posed a silly question when you demanded to know why they look like us. Again you hadn't done your homework and were wildly casting about for an anti-UFO argument. The best data concerning abductors and the beings seen in the physical trace cases (roughly 800 cases of the 5,000) indicates that the alien visitors do NOT look like us. By and large, we are dealing with short skinny little beings having oversized heads, large eyes, skinny arms and legs, four fin- gers, and practically no nose, mouth, or ears. I surely don't know anybody from Earth that fits that description who has been ob- served piloting highly maneuverable air- borne vehicles. Do you? I suppose one could say that gorillas look just like us since they walk upright, have two arms, two legs, two. eyes, a mouth, nose and ears, and genitals more or less like Earthlings. But I don't think most Earthlings would have any trouble distinguishing other humans from gorillas, do you? Also, despite the huge variety of living animals on Earth, one doesn't find all pos- sible combinations. Most have only two upper and two lower limbs, as opposed to 3,4,5; most have only two eyes, two ears, one nose. Females have two breasts not three or five or one. In other words, there seem to be pre- ferred arrangements that have evolved over time. We know essentially nothing about how many technological civilizations there have been on this planet over the past bil- lion years. We cannot say that this planet wasn't colonized, much as you SETI people refuse to include colonization or migration in your \"calculations\" about how many civiliza- tions there are in the galaxy. Proclamations would be a better word. The July issue of New Scientist says that ACTA Astronautica will carry an article by you in which you use the best accepted practices of the SETI community to com- pute the number of transmitting civiliza- tions in the galaxy, somewhere between 10,000 and 1 million. This is science? A factor of 100 spread?? No, it is dartboard physics. SETI thinks we Earthlings, especially the SETI Community, are the Crown of Creation as opposed to being the least advanced civi- lization in the neighborhood. We have been able to generate radio waves for about 100 years. We have been able to launch satellites for about 50 years. I think we are more like the baboons in a nature park in Africa than one of the more advanced civilizations. I doubt if you have made much effort to teach astronomy to the baboons. When I spoke of no astrophysicists working on advanced propulsion systems, I was thinking in terms of major programs which produced hardware that was ground tested. You brought up Freeman Dyson, indeed an outstanding astrophysicist, who was heavily connected with Project Orion. But according to Michael Flora's ar- ticle, only $11 million was spent on Orion over a seven-year period. The GE ANP program I worked on (1956-1959) in 1958 alone spent $100,000,000... and did test hardware. You have complained that I misrepre- sented SETI's views, and you seemed to deny that Lawrence Maxwell Krauss had said that aliens wouldn't know we were here until they received our signals. Here is the quote: \"It seems wildly un- likely that any civilization living there {where our TV signals would be reach- ing } would have had time, even had they possessed the necessary resources, to launch a mission to Earth that arrived by 1947\" {Roswell}. I have had a \"UFOs: Challenge to SETI Specialists\" article on my website for years. Do you have any complaints about it? After all, I have read a couple of your books, books by Carl Sagan, Frank Drake and others. Have you read either of mine or those by Maccabee, Haines, Hynek? Seth, I happen to strongly believe that a professional scientist trading on his edu- cational status has an obligation to know what he is talking about, which means to have studied the relevant data. Otherwise he should clearly state that he is expressing a personal opinion based on essentially no knowledge of the subject at hand. Don't you agree? In case you are wondering, I would be happy to do the debate again and give you a chance to improve on your 33% rating by the audience. Perhaps you can convince the 10% who thought it was a draw, or the 57% who voted for me, to change their minds. Also, congratulations on receiving the Klumpke-Roberts award for your contri- butions to public understanding and appre- ciation of astronomy. Most cordially, Stanton Friedman fsphys@rogers.com ww w. stanfriedman .com Canadian sighting reports increase Jim Bronskill in the Canadian Press re- ports, \"From a translucent, saucer-shaped object in British Columbia to mysterious lights buzzing motorists in New Brunswick, Canadians are on their way to reporting a record number of UFO sightings this year.\" More than 400 stories of curious en- counters were filed through the end of July, compared with just over 300 by this time last year, says Ufology Research of Manitoba, a group that tracks reports of unidentified flying objects. At this rate, the total for 2004 will sur- pass the current record of 673 sightings re- ported last year, said Chris Rutkowski, research co-coordinator for the Winnipeg- based organization. The group receives reports directly by telephone and e-mail from sister agencies that follow the phenomenon, and via fed- eral departments such as transport and na- tional defense. Rutkowski says, \"I think there is a re- surgence of interest in space.\" Dazzling mid-air maneuvers were a feature of some of the more dramatic otherworldly epi- sodes. 22 MUFON UFO Journal September 2004"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"RKETPLACE For advertising, contact John Schuessler, schuessler@mho.net, 303-948-6224.

Walter N Webb October 2004 Bright Planets (Evening Sky): Saturn (magnitude 0.2), in Gemini, rises in the ENE about 11:30 PM in mid- October and about 10:30 near month'send. Bright Planets (Morning Sky): Venus (-4.0) rises in the E about 3:30 AM and is up prominently at dawn. The dazzling planet closes on the much fainter star Regulus on the 3rd (separated by only 8 arc-minutes at 5 AM in Hawaii). The planet and star are still relatively near each other on the next few mornings, but moving steadily apart. Then Venus approaches within 5 degrees of Jupiter on the 31st. Finally, the lunar crescent is near Venus on Oct. 10 and 11. Mars (1.7) emerges in the ESE dawn sky about 6 AM late in the month. Jupiter (-1.7), in Virgo, emerges in the E at dawn about 5:30 AM (midmonth) during October and can be seen below Venus. Saturn stands high in the SSE at twi- light. The ringed planet is 5 degrees S of the Moon on the 7th. Moon Eclipse: On the night of Oct. 27-28, the full moon slides into the Earth's shadow, causing a total eclipse of the Moon. The entire U.S. will experience the darker umbral phases of the eclipse, including totality. (Alaska will catch most of the total phase.) Partial eclipse begins at 9:14 PM (EOT). The Moon is totally obscured from 10:23 to 11:45. Earth's satellite leaves the umbral shadow at 12:54 AM.

The absence of moonlight will aid in observing these mostly faint swift objects. But keep your eyes peeled for occasional bright fireballs as well. Moon Phases: Last quarterâ€”October 6 New moonâ€”October 13 First quarterâ€”October 20 Full moonâ€”October 27 The Stars: The heavenly symbols of 2 seasons-the Great Square of Pegasus and the Summer Triangle-grace the southern sky this month. Below Pegasus the only bright star in the entire lower southern sky is the white star Fomalhaut in Piscis Austrinus the Southern Fish. Of all the Ist-magnitude stars seen from northern latitudes, Fomalhaut (meaning \"fish's mouth\") is the southernmost and is often overlooked. Both the V-shaped Hyades and dipper- shaped Pleiades star clusters (in Taurus the Bull) appear for the first time above the eastern horizon-a hint of the winter sea- son yet to come. 24 MUFON UFO Journal September 2004"}]
