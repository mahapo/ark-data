UFOs and crop circles make for a queasy year north of the border. By Michael Strainic \"Easter bonnett\" crop circle. Sakutchewan. Canada, September 1992/Photo & investigation hy Chad Deetken. T his article was intended to be a simple year-end round-up of Canadian crop circle reports. However, it seems that nothing is ever truly sim- ple, and it soon became painfully clear that if anything at all had been rounded up in Canada in 1992. it was var- ious creatures, both great and small, all of whom had met their ends long before the year had reached its. It's not that Canada did not have crop circles in 1992. We most certainly did. and they were quite different from those we've hosted in previous years. And. it was one crop circle event in particular that suggested this possibly odd — and definitely tenuous — juxtaposi- tioning of events. Overall, the year 1992 was a bull market for things paranormal here in the Great White North. Several good videos were taken, both in New Brunswick and in Newfoundland, of what appear to be genuine UFOs. Some excellent still photos came out of Ontario later in the year. Abduction claims are (still) coming in at an alarming rate. Ogopogo, British Columbia's resident lake beast, surfaced once again. Sasquatch reports came in from areas where the elusive gent hadn't been spotted in decades. Even those dapper MIBs—painfully shy of late—made a rare appearance. Oh yes, and a Gray got his hand stuck in a window . . . But it was a milestone, of sorts, in Milestone. Saskatchewan that caused the most interest in the ufo- logical and cerealogical communities. CRYPTOTHANATOLOGY Not everyone agrees as to whether there is a direct UFO/crop circle connection, although the evidence is be- coming quite overwhelming. On the other hand, the re- lationship between animal mutilations and UFOs can ac- MAY 1993 NUMBER 301 PAGE 3"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL tually seem stronger, if one lends any credence whatso- ever to credible witness testimony, something we cer- tainly tend to do in the field of ufology. Still there are many holdouts to a UFO/mutilation connection. When an abductee relates having witnessed a cattle mutilation, their testimony regarding the abduction is accepted without question, but the rest of their story is either ig- nored, overlooked, or simply not mentioned. Cognitive dissonance, perhaps? Further still, there is an even smaller group of stal- warts who believe the mutilation problem is a non-phe- nomenon, or even constitute non-events. The most vocal of this non-phenomenon group is Jerome Clark of CU- FOS. Whenever Mr. Clark addresses this topic, he quotes the Kagan and Summers book Mute Evidence as the definitive information source for his convictions. Many investigators who have worked on mutilation cases would like to present counterarguments based on the specific information contained in this book, but un- fortunately, copies of this work are harder to find than a Gray willing to go on the Donahue Show. In addition, there is some real question as to how valuable and cred- ible this book is as an information source at all. Still, the bottom line remains that there are many researchers and investigators with hands-on experience in the field — quite literally — who simply do not agree that the mutilation cases constitute a non-phenomenon, and that there are many elements involved therein which still lack acceptable explanations. T he term \"cattle mutilation\" is, for one thing, a misnomer. It is also misleading. It is misleading in that many animals not categorized as cattle are af- fected. It is also misleading in that the animals who have become victims are only \"mutilated\" in the sense that they have been dismembered, disemboweled, and dis-several-other-things in ways that we can't readily ex- plain, or in ways that we ourselves do not do. When hu- mans do similar things to cattle in an organized fashion, we say they were \"butchered,\" not mutilated. Since the techniques used imply technology, expertise, and even purpose, \"mutilation\" seems to be a gross overstate- ment, and one laden with our biases. In addition to these radical surgical-type events, animals of all types are expiring, sometimes en masse, in a variety of other, perhaps less obvious ways that Science cannot currently explain. Language being what it is, we are stuck with the term \"cattle mutilation\" much in the way we were sad- dled with the term \"flying saucer.\" But, like \"UFO,\" while it may not be perfect, it's not too terribly inaccu- rate, either, and it is at least equatable with a certain loosely-delineated set of events. From a lexicographic standpoint, however, I believe \"mysterious death\" is a more accurate and a more inclusive descriptor for these various events, and I would strongly urge the use of the term \" cryptothanatology\" when referring to this study. CROP MUTILATIONS Being a lifetime subscriber to Aime Michel's philosophy of \"Consider everything, believe nothing,\" the similar- ities between crop circles'and~animal mutilations have always impressed me. Since we misuse and misapply the term \"mutilation\" to animals, we could just as inaccu- rately refer to crop fields as having been mutilated, since they suffer a similar type of \"rearrangement\" as cattle — precise, exact, almost sterile, and seemingly purposeful. Both crop circles and mutilations are usually discovered in somewhat remote areas, out away from large numbers of people, traffic and lights. Both are of- ten accompanied by reports of strange lights in the sky. Hoaxes and cult activity notwithstanding, there is a healthy residuum in both occurrences that we are hard pressed to explain. People discover a crop circle, and they wander into the field and stand in awe at the beauty. People discover a mutilation, and they wander into the field and stand in revulsion at the horror. Two sides of a coin are never very far apart. In extremely simplistic terms, since 1947, the UFO phenomenon has evolved altered, mutated, or simply changed thus: In the 1940s and 50s, we watched — from the ground and on our radar screens — as silvery disks flew merrily along at high altitude, often eluding our pursuit planes. In the 1960s, the disks and their variants came down to treetop level, and occasionally landed and did other annoying things, like stop cars or debark a humanoid or two. In the 1970s, not only did they, land, but they often took an unwilling passenger with them. Now, in the 80s and 90s, the occupants are walking right into our homes, even in such remote and sparsely-populated areas as New York City, to perform their rituals. The UFO phenomenon no longer avoids crowds and large cities. Whatever is happening, it is get- ting ever closer to home — very literally. Both crop circles and mutilations seem to be follow- ing this pattern. Crop circles are found near large urban areas, and if the crop-canvas permits, even in cities'. Mutilations, whatever their individual causes, are now happening in large cities as well, as we shall see. SLAUGHTERHOUSE SIX Rumors abound. Much of what we deal with in this field is rumor, and never progresses beyond that state. However, occasionally a rumor does get traced back to an original source, but subsequent investigation of the story simply yields more questions than it answers. And we should never forget that there are strange, bizarre, and sometimes grisly events which have a \"normal\" explanation: human beings. Even so. cases of urban mutilation, mysterious deaths, and the like should be studied much in the way we (should) study IFO cases and crop circle hoaxes. If they do a good imitation of cases which we cannot explain, we have to learn how, if at all possible, to distinguish between them. PAGE 4 NUMBER 301 MAY 1993"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL Early in 1992, a rumor reached us that some hogs had died under mysterious circumstances on a farm outside of Vancouver, Canada. When we tracked the rumor to a reliable source, we found that everything we had heard had been accurately reported. Individual hogs, i.e., one at a time over a span of time, had been found dead on an indoor hogfarm. The hogs had all been electrocuted, yet they were all discovered quite a distance from the nearest electrical outlet, implying that a very long ex- tension cord had been used to do the nefarious deed. Other damage was also inflicted on the animals. And, as our informant told us, \"someone was having sex with them.\" This information was related to us by a person working for the security company which was hired to in- stall some very sophisticated and very costly detection devices of various types. As far as we know, no culprit was ever apprehended. The southeastern corner of Saskatchewan produced more reports of cattle mutilations in 1992. We spoke with a young woman whose parents have a farm there, and who have been living with this disturbing situation for many years. This year proved to be no different. Cows were discovered with their tongues removed, sev- ered very far down in the throat. Esophagi were missing, as were other body parts. Predators, scavengers and in- sects all took an extended holiday. And — echoing a re- port discovered by Daniel Clairmont.a year previously — there was one case of \"porridge guts,\" aka in the USA, \"oatmeal innards.\" A cow had been found, re- cently mutilated, but otherwise in good condition. Yet, when it was cut open, it was found that the internal or- gans had turned to the consistency of oatmeal. M eanwhile, hundreds of miles to the north- east, other fairly typical cattle mutilations were occurring near Edmonton, in the province of Alberta. 2 To further confuse the issue, some inci- dents were reported which could be attributed to cult activity, a sick sense of humor, an intense dislike of the Canada Post Corporation, or a combination of these. Cow parts — both flesh and organs — were being deposited in mailboxes, mail slots, automo- biles and similar places. Earlier in the year, several cows were found dead near Seattle, Washington, under unusual circum- stances, and later two horses were mentioned in a similar context. Reports of other mysterious animal deaths, e.g., goats and sheep, etc., were coming in from the area of Bellingham, also in Washington state, but just across the U.S. border. Possibly relating to the events to be described next, more than a dozen cats had been found half-buried in a schoolyard in a Vancouver, B.C. suburb. A few weeks after the fol- lowing events transpired, reports of cat dismember- ments came out of Issaquah, near Seattle — bringing to mind the much-publicized cat disappearances in Piano, Texas. Vancouver half-Lai. August 6. I9V2. Clean, almost totally eviscer- ated. Photo bv Graham C<mwav/UFO*BC HALF-CAT CONUNDRUM On 04 June 1992, one of our members brought to our at- tention an article in a local Vancouver newspaper: \"Mystery Killer Rips Cats.\" 1 We contacted the Van- couver city pound, and learned that the newspaper ac- count was fairly accurate as far as it went. Between May 15 and June 4, five half-cats had been found in the Kerrisdale section of the city of Vancouver. All were cleanly severed in half, and eviscerated; not a single trace of blood was found anywhere on or around the cat. In no case had the missing half of the cat been found. Some of the half-cat remains were the front half, and some were the hindquarters. All five were discovered on the front lawns of homes other than their own. The first cat to be discovered was a purebred Russian Blue, and the rest — unstated in the article — we as- sumed were domestic shorthairs. No necropsy had been done on any of the cats, since it was assumed that a predator, a coyote in particular — as unlikely as that seemed based on the available evidence — had been the cause of the cats' demise. We asked to be notified if any other half-cats were found or if any other mysterious an- imal deaths were reported. Sadly, it was not a long wait. MAY 1993 NUMBER 301 PAGES"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL All were cleanly severed In half and eviscerated. Not a single trace of blood was found anywhere on or around the cats. Nor were the missing halves ever found. On August 5 we received a call from Mr. Jim Cousins at the Vancouver city pound. Another half-cat had been found, this time a Manx, remains to be seen. He said he would keep the half-cat until the end of the week if we wanted to examine it. The next day, myself, accompa- nied by Paul Anderson, Vancouver area Section Director and UFO*BC Director of Investigations, and Graham Conway, Flying Saucer Review consultant and UFO*BC Director of Special Investigations, went to view the half-cat. On arriving, we checked the pound records and learned that a total of six half-cats had been found — •• the missing halves had never been found. One front half had been found, three hindquarters, and two were un- recorded. This latest case was slightly different in several ways. It was more separated in time and location than the previous five. Whereas the first five had all been dis- covered on front lawns, this one was discovered in an al- leyway, on concrete. Also, there was an additional ex- cision area that had not been done — or perhaps had not been noticed — in the other cases. FtLIS NOVADLAD We then went to view the remains, which were uncere- moniously brought in, wrapped in a previously used plastic garbage bag which had been used to cover the half-cat when it was first discovered. Lamentably, it was exactly as had been advertised, with one minor ex- ception. We had been told that this half-cat was a Manx, but in fact it was not. Rather, it was a domestic longhair that had, due to accident or other misfortune, lost a por- tion of its tail, thereby giving it the look of a \"stumpy\" Manx. 4 That it was not a true Manx cat was important, as it shot holes in the theory that the perpetrator was some- one with a dislike for purebred cats. What was to prove extremely important, however, was the fact that the hapless half-cat was a domestic longhair. L onghaired cats, whether purebred or domestic, have much more fur per square centimeter than do short- haired cats. A longhair has just as many regular hairs as a shorthair, but the longhair has four or five extra guard hairs surrounding each individual strand of hair. This is of significance, because these guard hairs are very fine in texture and extremely porous. Because of this they would literally suck up blood or bodily fluids like a sponge. But in this case, they most definitely did not. While there was some very minor clotting at the major excision area — where the cat had been severed in two — the other excision area was completely clean. This other excision area was most interesting. When the half-cat was being shown to us, the excision was not noticed until it was pointed out to us — by parting the long fur on the side near the rear leg. In truth, this exci- sion was so clean and so perfect, and the fur surrounding it was so long, that it was completely undetectable from the outside. When viewed from the inside, however, it was quite obvious, as was the difficulty that must have been encountered when making it. The excision was, vi- sually at least, a perfect oval. There were no apparent jagged edges as would be expected when attempting to cut a curve with a straightedge of some sort. It looked, like so many crop circles, as if it had been punched out with a cookie-cutter. Whatever the method of cutting was it would have been particularly difficult to achieve, since the innermost edge of the excision was right up against some bone or cartilage. And, as mentioned, the fur in this area was completely clean. The condition of the half-cat was quite good. There was no evidence of long decay, and it was not unlike handling your average supermarket chicken, i.e., no blood, no strong odor of decay, no rigor mortis, etc. I ex- amined the hind area and could detect no evidence of puncture marks or rope marks or anything that would in- dicate that the animal had been suspended in order to drain the blood and fluids. Tissue samples were taken from both the major and oval excision areas and were sent immediately via courier to Dr. Altshuler. We still have not received the results of the tissue analysis. When the half-cat was returned to its final resting place in the garbage bag, we noticed that two maggots were left on the examining table. (We immediately named them Doug and Dave.) One of them was quite frisky, and the other was very literally a shell of its for- mer self. It is most likely that these two were former res- idents of the garbage bag, which had been used previ- ously, and did not come from the half-cat. WAR OF THE WHIRLS Maybe the circle artists, who — or whatever they are, were tired. Perhaps the ennui of 1992 English cerealogy in the post-Doug and Dave and pre-Schnabel era had spread to Canada in some undefinable way. Whatever the case, until August, crop circles were few and far be- tween, dubious for the most part, and simply put, sloppy. The interest in the phenomenon was there, to be sure. During the year, both Colin Andrews and George Wingfield had given lectures to very enthusiastic audi- ences in Vancouver. People were quite eager to report what they believed to be genuine crop circles; but what was being reported was highly unimpressive. Cases of obvious wind damage, lodging, seed spills, even a sky- diving target were all reported to investigators as crop circles. The few circles which were somewhat difficult to explain — at least where there was no patently obvi- ous explanation -^- were equally bland. So far, there just weren't any of those good old fashioned cookie-cut- PAGE.6 NUMBER 301 MAY 1993"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL ter circles, and an agriglyph seemed just too much to hope for. Chad Deetken, the Christopher Columbus of Canadian cerealogy (\"find it, then go land on it\") was spending an inordinate amount of time at home looking wistful. After the incredible circle events the previous year in Lethbridge, Alberta, 5 things looked pretty grim. T he earliest 1992 UGM 6 of any real interest was discovered near Edmonton, Alberta, in May. Christened a \"space cookie\" by certain researchers who shall (and should) remain nameless, 7 this was a depres- sion in the ground, a perfect six meter circle, with a depth ranging from five to thirty-one centimeters. Reminiscent of the reports of \"holes\" which have mys- teriously appeared in both Switzerland and Florida in 1991, and most recently in Belgium in 1993, this UGM seemed to be a rather odd hybrid crop circle/hole. The most curious feature of this formation is the fact that grass is growing straight up both inside and outside the circle. The possibility of this being a simple sinkhole has been ruled out by investigators. The next interesting formation—or complex—oc- curred in the towns of Strathclair and Ipswich, Manitoba, between August 1 and August 15. 8 The discovery of these formations coincided with a spate of UFO reports in the immediate area. The first event of this complex was discovered on August 1, southwest of Strathclair, Manitoba. This was a classic crop circle in which the grain was swirled in an anticlockwise direction. One week later, another for- mation was discovered directly opposite. This took the shape of the symbol for Mars, i.e., a circle with an arrow pointing away from the circle. This was the first of three similar formations to be discovered in the imme- diate area. In all three cases, the grain in the circle was swirled anticlockwise, the grain in the arrow \"shaft\" was flattened away from the circle, and the grain in the \"arms\" of the arrow was flattened back towards and away from the circle. On the evening of August 14, the night before the dis- covery of one of the Mars-symbol circles, at least two reports of UFOs were logged. One report involved a brilliant green flash of light which illuminated the coun- tryside for a few seconds, and the other was a multiple- witness CEI case which occurred directly over the very field in which one of the Mars-symbol circles was found. MILESTONE AND TOMBSTONE Just about the time things got shaking in Manitoba, the province of Saskatchewan re-entered the scene. Saskatchewan has a long and important history of UFO, crop circle, and related incidents, and it was about to be again the scene of some truly remarkable events. It began in the far north of the province, in late September, near Prince Albert. One of the farmers who had had circles in his field back in 1990 phoned Chad Saskatchewan has a long and important history of UFO, crop circle and related events, and was about to again be the scene of some truly remarkable events. Deetken in Vancouver with the news. They were back — a ringed circle had been discovered in a field nearby. Chad was on his way. While Chad was in transit, a sec- ond circle with a ring was also discovered, and it was there to greet him when he arrived. Although these cir- cles had been described as simple circles with rings, they actually bear a remarkable resemblance to holiday cha- peaux. While Chad Deetken was doing his usual Mexican Hat Dance in, around and through the \"caster bonnet\" crop circles up in the Prince Albert area, something far more interesting and much more unpleasant was being uncovered to the south. The other side of the coin had turned up on the farm of Joe Rennick, in Milestone, Saskatchewan. Ruth Walde, our Provincial Director for Sas- katchewan, telephoned to say they had learned of a crop circle formation with an odd new, ahem, twist—a dead animal inside the circle. An ex-porcupine, to be exact, and it was squashed flat, apparently by whatever force had formed the circles. Daniel Clairmont, ace investi- gator of UFO reports, crop circles, mutilations, and as- sorted other weird happenings and our Section Director for the area was already on the way; further details as they are available, film at eleven ... A t this point, I knew of only two other crop circle cases which involved an animal being inside a circle just prior to, or during, the formation of a crop cir- cle, so this report was of real interest. One report that had circulated, quite dubious, claimed that a desiccated frog was discovered in the exact center of a crop circle near Atlanta, Georgia. The other incident, reliable be- yond question, was related to me by Greg Kennedy, a physicist from Montreal who does our radiation analy- ses. While inspecting a crop circle in England during the Argus project, Greg discovered a mouse—and the house of the mouse—inside the formation. The lay of the grain, intertwined with the mouse-house, indicated that the circle had formed around the aforementioned ro- dent and its domicile. The mouse appeared to be com- pletely unharmed, and quite oblivious to what had taken place around him. Whatever was awaiting Danny Clairmont in Milestone, it promised to be interesting. PORCUPINE FLATS As often happens, originally reported information doesn't always exactly match that which is learned later, and that certainly proved to be the case here. However, these differences are very minor, and we are left with a MAY 1993 NUMBER 301 PAGE 7"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL report both bizarre and baffling. We originally heard that the porcupine had been found between undamaged layers of wheat. This was not the case, however, and the animal was actually found on top of the flattened (yet still undamaged) wheat. At any rate, this incident of laminatory porcupinage leaves many questions to be answered, as we do know that the grain beneath the animal was not damaged to any noticeable degree, and that the poor porcupine was flattened — in situ — to ap- proximately a one-inch thickness. To appreciate the full impact of this situation, it should be noted here that the cute, cartoonish conception of a porcupine can be quite different from the reality: in addition to the obvious problems posed when encountering porcupine quills, a porcupine is a very sturdy and often very hefty animal, sometimes weighing in at from 22 to 27 kilograms (50 to 60 pounds). Rattening one would not be an easy propo- sition under any circumstances. In keeping with the lax design standards the circle makers had set for themselves this year, the Milestone formation was, in a word, a mess (although \"slovenly\" pops to mind as well). Rather than the precise cookie- cutter effect of classic circles and agriglyphs, this one ap- peared to have been designed with the precision and sub- tlety of a sledgehammer. However, on close inspection, it did have many of the traits one would expect to find in a genuine formation. For lack of a better description, this formation would have to be categorized as a triplet of joined circles, although \"circles\" is far from accurate — irregular rectangles would be a far better description. The total affected area was 63 feet by 22 feet, and the grain in each rectangle was swirled anticlockwise. Each rectangle had an irregular center of standing wheat. And it was in this odd formation that our porcupine met his end. STUCK IN MUD When Danny arrived on the scene in Milestone, he learned that the porcupine in question would not be available for an interview — or anything else. By the time Mr. Rennick discovered the formation — and corpse — the porcupine was already badly decomposed. Not suspecting that anyone would be interested in actu- ally examining it, he simply phoned the local newspaper, took some photos, and then disposed of the carcass. However, some four weeks after the event, evidence testifying to the passing of the porcupine was still quite visible. The trace marks which were left on the ground suggest the following sequence of events: the animal, while attending to typical porcupine affairs, was sud- denly, and without any warning, caught up in whatever force or mechanism is responsible for the creation of the circles. At what point the porcupine actually shuffled off his mortal coil is impossible to say. But it is apparent that it was dragged — or pushed, or maneuvered, or perhaps had even dragged itself — through the mud and wheat from one corner of the formation, a total of somewhere on the order of 40+ feet, to its final resting place, where it was ultimately found. The porcupine was discovered lying on top of the flat- tened grain. The quills on the porcupine were arranged in such a way as to suggest that they had been swirled by the same force that had affected the wheat. Quills and wheat were intertwined. As well, the porcupine had been pushed right down into the mud — there was mud on the animal, and there were quills and wheat left in the mud. The mud, including that with porcupine parts, was highly compressed and completely dried out. The mud was so dry and so compacted that pieces of it could not be broken by hand. It was during the extensive investigation of this bizarre event that Danny learned that this was not the first time a local porcupine had checked out in an odd way. It had happened before, not too long ago, and not too far away, and the incident had been thoroughly in- vestigated by none other than the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. THE QUILL MEMORANDUM In 1989, when the remains of a porcupine were discov- ered in a grain field near Estevan, Saskatchewan, the cir- cumstances involved were sufficiently unusual that the RCMP were called in to investigate. The remains of this porcupine were found in what ap- peared to be a charred, or perhaps oily, circular black- ened patch of wheat. All that remained of the porcupine was the skeleton — or most of the skeleton: the jawbone and parts of the spine were missing. The blackened patch of ground was connected by a pathway of sorts to what was evidently a crop circle formation, suitably sloppy, and similar- and odd-looking enough to have been an older sibling of this year's Milestone formation. The RCMP investigation was carried out because the circumstances — the charred wheat, the dead por- cupine and missing porcupine-parts — suggested that some sort of ritual sacrifice had taken place. That old perennial favorite \"cult activity\" had been receiving its usual media hype, so the RCMP were focusing on find- ing proof of this. Specifically, they wanted to know if burning had been involved in the termination of the porcupine. For some reason, the crop circle formation it- self seems to have been overlooked completely, per- haps written off as a curious byproduct of the assumed ritual. A s the photos of this site clearly imply, the porcu- pine remains had indeed been burned in some way. When the samples were sent to the forensic labo- ratory for analysis, the only thing that was being sought was verification (and if the results were positive, perhaps the nature) of the assumed burning process. This in itself raises a few questions — why was this the only thing be- ing checked? The laboratory report clearly indicates PAGES NUMBER 301 MAY 1993"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL that no other tests were carried out, at least not at that particular facility. 10 In a classic example of \"the more you learn, the less you know,\" when the analysis was completed, it was learned that there was no evidence of burning. So, if no burning was involved in this incident, just what exactly did strip the flesh so cleanly and thor- oughly from the skeleton, a la Snippy? It was stated that there was no evidence of burning. Did this also in- clude the possibility of chemical burning? We do not know. Or radiation burning? We do not know. What caused the charred appearance? If we assume that this one laboratory analysis is indeed the only one which was ever done, we don't know that either, and most likely we never will. It was a great analysis though, just incom- plete, aimed at the wrong target, and it answered noth- ing. And that, of course, brings to mind what Jacques Vallee has pointed out so appropriately concerning lab- oratory tests: since we don't know what we are looking for, testing becomes virtually impossible. The type and number of possible tests is, in a practical sense, limitless. And most importantly, we don't know if the truly valu- able evidence would be something which is there to be found, or something which should be and is not. All in all, we had a rather peculiar case, or cases, on our hands. Not only an odd and interesting crop circle, but a dead and flattened porcupine as well, apparently a victim of the circle makers. No porcupine bits remained for analysis, so whatever pathological evidence might have existed was lost. A near duplicate case had oc- curred two years previously, and that case yielded ab- solutely nothing as well. If this type of report, a crop cir- cle with casualties, is a precursor of things to come, we have no substantial evidence to guide us in the fu- ture. QUITE CONTRARY It is too late to reexamine and reanalyze the 1989 por- cupine remnants. The analysis done back then is in- conclusive and leaves major questions unanswered. We don't have any 1992 porcupine fragments, either. However, we did gather plenty of grain samples suitable for analysis, and this was done immediately. Four separate grain samples (wheat heads with seeds) from the affected areas were collected, and control sam- ples were gathered 200 feet to the south of the forma- tion. The samples, along with a preliminary report of the investigation, were sent by Mr. Clairmont to Dr. W.C. Levengood of the Pinelandia Biophysical Laboratory in Michigan. Dr. Levengood's analysis\" provides some very interesting reading. Excerpting and paraphrasing Dr. Levengood's re- port, we have the following information: both the circle samples and the controls were identical in external ap- pearance. However, the seeds from the circle samples were well below normal in weight and development. Three of the four circle samples showed a significant de- crease in the cell wall pit diameters. Yet the most sur- prising data came from the germination tests. Extreme variations in seedling growth were discovered in the sample groups. Whereas samples #1-3 were signifi- cantly suppressed in development, sample #4 exhibited a marked increase in growth and development, a cbndi- tion that sample #4 maintained over the controls throughout the entire 10 days of testing. Circle samples #2, #3 and #4 showed a significant de- crease in pit size. This is an indication of probable ex- posure to high heat, and it would be expected that these samples would exhibit a definite lack of vigor in ger- mination and growth. However, not only is this not the case, it is quite the opposite. Sample #4 exhibited a growth rate far exceeding the control samples. Still, it was not a direct (inverse) correlation (i.e., degree of pit size change as compared to the rate of growth increase). Dr. Levengood posits that this lack of a correlation might be explained if the process involved in circle- making is a recurrent kinetic process of a sort that never exactly repeats itself. ABSENCE OF PREDICTABILITY I do not believe it is unfair to suggest that Dr. Levengood is of the opinion that crop circles are the product of some sort of natural process which we cur- rently do not understand. And logically, if it is natural, it should be predictable. So, when searching for candidates for this process, he asks, \"What could account for this absence of predictability?\" Indeed. It is this very lack of predictability that has been the bane of phenomenologists since time and/or phenomena began. Most \"natural\" phenomena are even- tually caught in the act of being phenomenal. As in chaos theory, their seemingly random behavior is gov- erned by certain not-yet-understood physical laws, and the patterns involved are too complex to be perceived by us. Predictability may remain out of reach, but the pat- terns repeat, and sooner or later, the jig is up. Well, this has not happened with the UFO phenomenon, much to the consternation of the \"natural\" explanationists. Consequently, the term \"jealous\" has been applied to the UFO phenomenon, for one, referring to the fact that it remains elusive when it apparently shouldn't. And this insinuates that rather than being a natural phenomenon, it is a non-natural phenomenon. Of course, intelligent design or control behind the UFO or any other phenomenon would certainly account for this lack of predictability. If this posited intelligence does not wish to be known, nonpre- dictability would be a very basic requirement. Since natural explanations simply do not fit the objects of our scrutiny, we must assume — rightly or wrongly — that there is an intelligence at work and that it is going to continue to confound us. And that means more rig- orous investigation and more complete recording of data.

This will certainly involve more work, but it sure beats looking back from ten years down the road and asking, \"why weren't we keeping track of abductees' shoe sizes? We'd have had this thing solved by now ...\" TIES THAT BIND A relationship does exist between crop circles and mys- terious animal deaths, even if it is only one of imagery and interpretation. It could be that crop circles are yin to the classic mutilation's yang, but that would imply that human value judgments are absolute, and that would. seem rather unlikely. What we do have for certain, though, is a similarity between unknown quantities. Whether there is a direct relationship here, or if these events are merely coincidental, is a moot point. What remains important is that these incidents are continuing to occur, and they at least appear to be changing. Anyone with an interest in UFOs who was alive at the time, remembers when they first heard about Snippy the Horse. More recently, and in a far less explosive way, the crop circle phenomenon more or less oozed into our awareness. Yet neither phenomenon is new. Both phe- nomena may have been around much longer than we even suspect. But one thing is certain: both are cur- rently en vogue. Another certainty is that, in Canada at least, they seem to have been, on occasion, operating in tandem. And one other fact, redeemable at your neigh- borhood financial institution, is that these two particular phenomena, along with many of their brethren, friends, and cousins, are becoming much bolder. They are coming closer to us. Why? CREDIT DEPARTMENT This article is the result of a great deal of research and investigation by many people, made possible with the kind assistance of others.

Some of the most remarkable sightings are actually complex hoaxes that have been carefully engineered for our benefit. The witnesses are merely the victims and instruments rather than the authors of the hoax. — Dr. Jacques Vallee O n February 6, 1966, near a suburb of Madrid, a group of Spanish soldiers observed a circular lu- minescent object land near an ammo dump. The disk was approximately 30' in diameter and bore an unusual symbol (three vertical lines with a central hor- izontal line) on its underside. After the object shot off, ^ three deep rectangular impressions were found at the (landing site. / A year later in another Madrid suburb, a lens-shaped object with a dome on top was seen traveling along power lines just above tree top level. This object was also emblazoned with the same symbol seen by the Spanish soldiers. Two photographers sent pictures to the newspaper Informaciones, and several months later additional pictures were delivered by a third photogra- pher. As with the earlier incident, landing marks (in- cluding a scorched area and a metallic powder residue) were found near the area of the sighting. During the next few days, residents of the area dis- covered several strange objects, shiny metal cylinders with a central disk portion. When opened, the cylin- ders were found to contain a tough plastic strip em- bossed with the same symbol seen on the underside of the UFOs. A reward for the recovery of more of the mysterious objects was posted by a Henri Dagousset, with instruc- tions that the objects be forwarded to one Antoine Nancey in Madrid. One of the objects was turned over to a Spanish UFO researcher by a man named Antonio Pardo, who just happened to be one of the photographers who had sent photos of the UFO to Informaciones. Curiously, investigators who attempted to locate Dagousset, Nancey and Pardo met with no success; they did not exist. When the cylinders were analyzed they were found to be constructed of earthly materials. The photos of the alleged UFO were analyzed by the French satellite imaging company, SPOT, who con- cluded that the photos were fakes. The UFO model in the photos was determined to be 8.5 to 10 inches in di- ameter and was suspended 10 feet from the camera. In one photo, the suspension string was revealed after en- hancement. In short, the entire affair was an elaborate hoax, but the story does not end there. Shortly thereafter and continuing for several years, documents bearing the same symbol as the hoaxed pho- tos were mailed to numerous European UFO re- searchers. These documents came to be known as the UMMO documents. UMMO was supposedly the planet of origin of both the UFOs in the hoaxed photos and the documents. The UMMOians mailed hundreds of pages of data on their technology, their planet and their phi- losophy. The author(s) of these documents were obvi- ously knowledgeable in college-level physics, although the UMMO computer technology as described in the documents was considered advanced by 1960s stan- dards, but is crude by comparison to 1990s computer technology. A cult-like group (including several credentialed sci- entists) formed to study the UMMO documents and spread the word of the UMMOians. The UMMO phe- nomenon spread across Europe and Latin America. Among the UMMO revelations was the existence of a counterpart or mirror universe to our own, much akin to Billy Meier's DAL Universe. Comparisons between UMMO and the Meier's alleged Pleiadian contacts are unavoidable. Since the whole UMMO story is a hoax, one could conclude that the same group of hoaxers could be behind the Meier case. If so, the level of ex- pertise in hoaxing convincing UFO photos has risen considerably. The most obvious question is, who is do- ing the hoaxing and why? I t was feared that UMMO was a means for East-Bloc intelligence agencies to establish contacts with Western scientists, which is also a possible explanation for the Meier affair. Consider this: Meier quit taking UFO photos a few years ago, coinciding with the end of the Cold War. The KGB, who certainly possessed the ex- pertise necessary to produce convincing UFO photos, could have simply pulled the plug on the operation due to the changing political climate. Another possible explanation involves one of the more bizarre characters in U.S. political history. According to noted UFO researcher Dr. Jacques Vallee, several French UFO investigators believe they have un- covered a link between the ongoing UMMO activities and scientists associated with the shadowy Lyndon LaRouche organization. LaRouche has organized a num- ber of European front groups that would have had both the financial resources and technical expertise to perpe- trate a hoax of this magnitude. MAY 1993 NUMBER 301 PAGE 11"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL A disturbing trend In UFOIogy has been sur- facing in recent years. More and more UFO lecturers have begun to Incorporate political ideology and fringe right-wing buzzwords into their presentations. Most readers are probably unfamiliar with LaRouche, a radical neo-Nazi who controlled a \"political cult\" that raked in as much as $80 million a year. Fundraising activities occurred in almost every airport, where LaRouche disciples would solicit donations under the banner of \"Feed Jane Fonda to the Whales\" and \"Beam Weapons/ Fusion Energy Now!\" Ultimately, it was LaRouche's illegal fund-raising schemes (credit card scams, fraud and theft) that landed him in a cell in the federal penitentiary where he now resides. Just because LaRouche advocated some bizarre poli- cies, such as his belief that the Queen of England was the boss of the international drug trade, and as recently as the late '70s advocating a nuclear war with the U.S.S.R (he considered 150 million American deaths as \"acceptable\"), he was in frequent contact with some of the more radical elements of the Reagan administra- tion. Indeed, LaRouche was probably the intellectual au- thor of President Reagan's SDI program. Dennis King, author of Lyndon LaRouche and the New American Fascism, described LaRouche's suc- cesses thusly: \"The major media had failed over the years to vigorously unmask LaRouche. Jewish and Black organizations and the left had largely ignored his dramatic political inroads in the early 1980s, blithely al- lowing him to operate his international network of hate from midtown Manhattan with nary a protest. Reagan administration aides, GOP operatives, Teamster leaders, and others on the right had treated him as just another political ally, to be used as needed. When the Klan en- dorsed President Reagan, it immediately received a blis- tering denunciation from him. But when NBC exposed the administration's ties to LaRouche, the White House response was that it would continue to meet with whomever it pleased.\" The links between LaRouche and the Republican Party become confused when in 1984, LaRouche became a Democrat — running in Democratic presi- dential primaries. Thousands of LaRouchians ran for office in local Democratic primaries, disrupting Democratic party activities from coast-to-coast. The Democrats seemed unable to respond to the LaRouche disruption, which U.S. Senator Patrick Moynihan CD- NY) described as \"...a breakdown in our political immune system.\" Local LaRouchian Claude Jones was elected Chairman of the Harris County (Houston) Democratic Party, apparently because his name was the most WASPish on the ballot. Local Democrats endured the embarrassing spectacle of stripping their Chairman of all authority by temporarily chang- ing their by-laws. It could easily be inferred that LaRouche's disruption of the Democratic Party had the blessings, if not the complicity, of the GOP. All attempts to expose LaRouche resulted in a bevy of slander, libel, and civil rights lawsuits against the offending news organization. One such legal blitz caused the Washington Post to delete all references to LaRouche's Nazi philosophy in reporter John Mitz' story on the connections between LaRouche and the Reagan administration. When mentioned at all by the media, LaRouche was usually described as a \"conserv- ative Democrat.\" What does all this have to do with the subject of UFOs? A disturbing trend in UFOIogy has been surfac- ing in recent years. More and more UFO lecturers have begun to incorporate political ideology into their pre- sentations. Terms like \"Trilateralists, Council on Foreign Relations, The New World Order /One World Conspiracy and Zionists\" are used with increasing fre- quency in UFO lectures and publications. The fact that these terms have been the buzzwords of extreme right- wing fringe groups should send off alarm bells loud and clear. T ake the case of George Green. Mr. Green claims to have seen \"flying saucers\" in a hanger at Edwards AFB in 1958. After his discharge, Green went about making his fortune in financial services, and most re- cently, publishing. On October 18,1989 Green claims to have had direct telepathic contact with the Pleiadian Commander Gyeorgos Ceres Hatonn, whose precise ti- tle is \"Commander-in-Chief, Earth Project Transition, Pleiades Flight Command, Intergalactic Fleet - Ashtar Command: Earth Representative to the Cosmic Council on Earth Transition\" (we'll just call him Hatonn for short). Hatonn's communications (via psychic channeling) have filled up 26 volumes of Green's Phoenix Journal. Among the revelations: Hatonn has a computer that al- lows him to keep up with the day to day activities of every human on Earth; Hatonn is here to help; Pray to Hatonn. Green also publishes the Phoenix Journal Express \"for more up to the minute information\" i.e., first-person narratives allegedly channeled telepathi- cally from Hatonn (the English is really stilted in spots so it must be from aliens). Hatonn is deeply concerned about U.S. economic policy, U.S. income tax structure, the International Monetary Fund, the CFR, the Trilateralists, and of course, the Zionists. Hatonn ap- parently has a lot in common with right-wing neo-Nazi fringe groups. Watching one of Green's videotaped lectures can be enlightening. He spouts the usual fringe-right litany, and occasionally lapses into the standard LaRouche rhetoric about beam weapons, AIDS and the menace of the Zionists. He mentions the ongoing research of his friend, Eustace Mullins, an associate of both the neo- Nazi Sons of Liberty and the LaRouche organization. Oh PAGE 12 NUMBER 301 MAY 1993"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL yes, he spends a few minutes talking about Billy Meier's purported Pleiadian UFO contacts. Green's wife Desiree then takes the podium. Desiree, according to her biography, \"...has been elected by the 'Lighted Command' who refer to them- selves as 'The Hosts from Heaven, sent of God/Creator' as one of their public spokespersons for sharing the WORD contained within the Phoenix Journal series. She presents the Cosmic spiritual knowledge regarding our Divine Spiritual Heritage Within\" (their punctuation). What this boils down to is about 15 minutes of an uninterrupted stream of pseu- do-religion, new age cliches and psychobabble. During Desiree's lecture, Green grins incessantly, either due to husbandly pride, or more likely from barely being able to keep a straight face at this non- sense being presented as fact. Another interesting example is Dr. Fred Bell. Bell not only claims to be in contact with the Pleiadian Semjase of Billy Meier fame, but to have had sexual liaisons with her. He was recently a guest on a local radio talk show to promote his appearance at a metaphysical fes- tival here in Houston. Bell recounted some of the teach- ings of the Pleiadian \"Space Brothers,\" although, curi- ously, the name of His Supreme Cosmic Highness Hatonn wasn't mentioned. It didn't take long before the usual kook-right propaganda began, including the obligatory slam at \"Zionists.\" The host, to his credit, cut Bell off and apologized to his listeners with words to the affect of \"I thought he was going to talk about UFOs.\" A pattern is developing. People interested in the sub- ject of UFOs are hooked by talk of \"Pleiadian Space Brothers\" and then subjected to fringe right political propaganda. The fact that these neo-Nazis can prosely- tize an unsuspecting audience has apparently made in- filtration of UFO organizations a political objective of these groups. After meeting with Robert (Area 51) Lazar, Jacques Vallee began receiving letters from a \"colonel\" near Las Vegas, inviting him to spend a month (all expens- es paid) with a group of people who were preparing \"a major belief change in America.\" The incentive for joining this group was \"to establish contact with the aliens.\" Vallee was instantly put-off by this group's letterhead featuring a Nazi styled eagle clutching SS (sig runeri) lightning bolts. Says Vallee: \"Another aspect many researchers in this field (UFOs) have studiously avoided is the link between the more eager proponents of imminent extraterrestrial contact and the American extreme right. It could well be the same kind of fanaticism that leads people to join neo-Nazi, anti-Semitic, or sur- vivalist movements in the American SW also induces them to believe in the imminent arrival of aliens from the sky. But it could also be that some intelligence agency, or some rogue group within such an agency, has been bending the latest paranoia of some extremist \"It could well be the same kind of fanaticism that leads people to Join neo-Nazi, anti- Semitic, or survlvalist movements in the American SW also Induces them to believe in the Imminent arrival of aliens from the sky.\" —Jacques Vallee political movements to its own ends as useful, conve- nient testbeds for covert psychological experiments.\" In his excellent book Revelations, Vallee recounts the Bentwaters (England) case to illustrate his point. As described by many of the witnesses, the incident could certainly have been a set-up to gauge the response of military personnel to this apparent CE3K. The case of the Gulf Breeze Six also raises questions for Vallee. Were these six soldiers deliberately exposed to materials that led them to believe a major UFO incident would occur at Gulf Breeze? The fact that the Gulf Breeze Six were simply discharged with- out disciplinary action should raise an eyebrow or two, considering that they all held high security clear- ances and their going AWOL could have represented a major security breach. Vallee believes that the U.S. has developed a convincing-looking UFO which is \"being actively tested on military personnel, thus the persons who control the experiment can always con- tain the repercussion if the story ever leaks out.\" T here is an abundance of circumstantial evidence to indicate that UFO hoaxes are being perpetrated by persons or organizations with substantial resources. The anti-Semitic focus of some of these hoaxers should arouse immediate suspicion. The fact that many UFO enthusiasts believe in a pantheon of alien entities that features blonde, Nordic-looking \"Aryans\" from the Pleiades as the cosmic \"good-guys\" in an interstellar battle between good and evil should give an indication of how successful these groups have already been. In addition to the hoaxers' ability to infiltrate and influence UFO organizations, anti-demo- cratic factions within intelligence agencies can con- duct psychological and unconventional warfare exper- iments without scrutiny under the guise of UFOs. Due to the success of frauds like Messrs. Green and Bell, ardent cadres of zealous \"true believers\" can be depended upon to embarrass serious UFO investiga- tors, while diverting attention from and casting doubt on serious UFO reports, which may in fact be the hoaxers' ultimate goal. When confronted with self-proclaimed heralds of Pleiadian Space Brothers, it would be advisable to remain skeptical. If there are alien visitors who wish to establish contact with the human race, they could certainly do so much more effectively than with the political extremists, kooks and scam artists that are currently acting as their ambassadors.

Such accounts can be in- terpreted as literally true, as unconscious falsehoods, as deliberate falsehoods, or as mixtures of all three— al- though for some reports, such as those involving docu- mented wounds to or \"alien\" residue upon the infant children of abductees. 6 only truthfulness or deliberate de- ception seem possible as explanations. In any case, the deliberate falsification of abduction trauma, when incentives such as money or mass-pub- licity or the avoidance of work are not evident, would seem to be similar to cases that occasionally occur in or- dinary medical practice, when with intentional deception an individual feigns or self-inflicts the symptoms of disease, apparently for no other reason than to obtain the attention and ministrations of medical staff. Such indi- viduals are said to present with \"factitious disorders.\" The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, version III, revised (DSM-III-R) 7 lists two major classes of factitious disorder: factitious disorder with psychological symptoms, and factitious disorder with physical symptoms. Virtually all of the medical lit- erature on the factitious disorders focuses upon chronic factitious disorder with physical symptoms, better known as Munchausen's syndrome. Patients diagnosed with chronic factitious disorders with psychological symptoms have similar characteristics to patients with Munchausen's syndrome, and often have histories of presenting falsely with both psychological and physical symptoms. 8 Munchausen's-type individuals may account for only few, if any, abduction reports, but a description of their characteristics and a discussion of the relationship be- tween the factitious disorders, less conscious forms of deception, and other mental disorders, may be useful to abduction researchers. M unchausen's syndrome was first formally described in 1951 by Richard Asher, a physi- cian at the Central Middlesex Hospital in London. 9 Asher named the disorder, which he wished to distin- guish from hysteria or malingering but did not consid- er to be particularly rare, after Baron Karl Friedrich von Munchausen, an eighteenth-century character who was alleged (in a book whose contents were later said to be substantially false) to have wandered from tavern to tavern throughout his life, telling tall tales. The individual with Munchausen's syndrome, accord- ing to Asher, typically bore scars from numerous prior operations, and presented with a medical condition which was acute but not obviously confirmable or convincing — for instance, intense abdominal pain, severe blood-loss despite an absence of pallor, or a dramatic episode of unconsciousness. The Mun- chausen's patient also would manifest \"a mixture of truculence and evasiveness in manner\" towards hospi- tal staff, as well as evidence of a \"litigious\" disposi- tion; frequently he would check out of the hospital against the advice of hospital staff. \"[Few] doctors can boast that they have never been hoodwinked by the condition,\" wrote Asher. Often the diagnosis is made by a passing doctor or sister, who, recognizing the patient and his perfor- mance, exclaims, \"I know that man. We had him in St. Quinidine's two years ago and thought that he had a perforated ulcer. He's the man who always collapses on buses and tells a story about being an ex-submarine commander who was tor- tured by the Gestapo.\" Equally often, the trickster is first revealed in the hospital dining-room, when with a burst of laughter, one of the older residents exclaims: \"Good heavens, you haven't got Luella Priskins in again, surely? Why she's been in here three times before and in Bart's, Mary's, and Guy's [hospitals] as well. She sometimes comes in with a different name, but always says she's coughed up pints of blood and tells a story about PAGE 14 NUMBER 301 MAY 1993"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL being an ex-opera singer and helping in the French resistance movement.\" Discussions of this disorder continued in medical journals after Asher's paper, and have increased partic- ularly in the last decade. Nowadays Munchausen's-type patients are said to present with any of a wide variety of apparent physical and psychological problems including tuberculosis, cancer, AIDS, asthma, ulcers, epilepsy, anemia, depression, hallucinations, paraplegia, suicidal ideation, ear-nose-and-throat conditions, respiratory fail- ure, cardiac disease, dental disease, kidney disease, war- wounds, various fevers and allergies, and a number of more esoteric conditions including lupus erythematosus, Battler's syndrome and Goodpasture's syndrome. A let- ter to the New England Journal of Medicine in 1980 even described a man who had falsely presented with Munchausen's syndrome (his scars washed off with soap and water) although that letter was later retracted as a hoax. 10 O ccasionally, diseases claimed by Munchausen's type patients are diseases which have only re- cently been identified and may still be somewhat con- troversial within the medical community but have nev- ertheless received wide coverage in the popular media. Examples include factitious post-traumatic stress disor- ders following non-existent war trauma or satanic ritual abuse.\" It must be said, however, that in the case of a widely-publicized but non-existent disease which may excuse its patients from work or school, doctors will have difficulty distinguishing a (deliberate but compul- sive) Munchausen's patient from an (unconscious) hys- teric or from a (deliberate but non-compulsive) malin- gerer. Munchausen's sufferers may be found to have ac- tual physical disorders which have not been self-in- flicted, although more usually the accompanying dis- eases are psychiatric: depression, schizophrenia, \"VIP syndrome\" (pretending to be an important official or a relative of one) and multiple personality disorder have been described in association with Munchausen's. Munchausen's-by-proxy, or MBP, is a term intended to describe the behavior of a parent — almost always a mother — who falsely claims disease in her child. Typically the child of the MBP mother suffers from ac- tual symptoms which suggest an underlying disease but which have been artificially induced by the mother. Suffocation of the child is probably the most common technique, and children of MBP-mothers often have a history of dozens of episodes of mysterious apnea or hy- poxic seizures requiring hospitalization. 12 Some such episodes, unfortunately, result in the death of the child, and several MBP mothers have been jailed for their ac- tions. 13 Other MBP techniques include poisoning, de- liberate malnutrition, scarring and alteration of labora- tory specimens. Although the distinction between deliberate deception and honest delusion may be diffi- cult to establish, It may be less Important than the psychological need which underlies and promotes both types of behavior. In one case published in the medical literature, a child was taught by his mother to mimic epileptic seizures. Such children may go on to develop Munchausen's syndrome themselves; indeed, MBP mothers typically have a history of Munchausen-type be- havior directed against their own bodies, and there is even a case in which a mother and her (adult) daughter presented with factitious disorders simultaneously. It also should be noted that the proxy and victim in MBP cases are not always mother and child; the literature includes one case in which the proxy was the father, and also one in which the proxy was a man and his victim was his wife; after his wife's death, the man's girlfriend became the new victim. The behavior of nurses who de- liberately harm or kill patients in their care has been at- tributed to a pathological desire for the attention and ex- citement that come with medical emergencies, and thus may also have psychological links with Munchausen's- by-proxy. The typical Munchausen's or MBP patient will have a history of family problems, one or more personality disorders, and may in particular have experienced abuse, social isolation, and/or neglect from parents during childhood. The fact that Munchausen's syndrome and MBP occur relatively frequently in pregnant women and in nurses suggests that these syndromes, even if made more likely by genetic factors or by adverse child- hood experiences, may be triggered by other factors in adulthood. The patient's Munchausenian behavior may have begun, for example, after a stay in hospital during which she was given a pleasurable amount of attention by both parents and hospital staff, or after working in a hospital and envying the attention enjoyed by patients. Later, while in hospital and feigning disease in herself or her child, she will frequently exaggerate or lie about things for no obvious reason, and in general will seem both glib and evasive, with poor impulse control. Her medical and personal history (or that of her child) is likely to be false or distorted, changing as circumstances warrant. She will have a surprising familiarity with medical terminology and hospital procedures. Her (feigned) symptoms may subside when she believes that she (or her child) is no longer being watched by hos- pital staff. 14 Covert video surveillance of Munchausen's or MBP patients has been used with some success in the diag- nosis of both disorders, and in MBP patients has been admissible as evidence in court. However, in some cases Munchausen's and Munchausen's-by-proxy patients have proved themselves remarkably adept at evading such surveillance. Even if such surveillance succeeds, MAY 1993 NUMBER 301 PAGE 15"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL the Munchausen's or MBP patient will typically be re- sistant to psychological introspection and will not be co- operative following diagnosis of Munchausen's syn- drome. Such a diagnosis is usually followed by the dis- appearance of the patient and her reappearance at an- other hospital. Commission to a psychiatric institution for treatment of Munchausen's may be followed by sui- cide. 15 Although one report mentions a Munchausen's patient with an apparent brain abnormality detectable by MRI scan, there is as yet no consensus regarding an underly- ing or predisposing neuropathology. I ndividuals with unconsciously fabricated illnesses often appear to be driven by the same underlying psychological need as individuals with factitious disor- ders, and yet they seem to satisfy this need in a much more effective manner, by producing symptoms uncon- sciously so that they themselves consciously believe that the symptoms are real. The manifestation of Munchausen's-type symptoms as opposed to the symp- toms of hysterical disorders may simply reflect the un- conscious inability of the individual with a need for medical attention (or attention from other authorities) to convince his conscious self that his symptoms are real. This inability may be gender-related; for factitious dis- orders are reported more often in men, while hysterical disorders are reported more often in women. This in- ability may also be overcome; the deliberate falsification of symptoms in Munchausen's syndrome has been re- ported on occasion to be transformed into the uncon- scious falsification of such symptoms. Therefore, al- though the distinction between deliberate deception and honest delusion may be difficult to establish, it may be less important than the psychological need which un- derlies and promotes both types of behavior. This problem is highlighted in a recent paper by Toth and Baggaley, 16 who describe a patient with both Munchausen's syndrome and Multiple Personality Disorder. The patient, \"G.C.Z.,\" had the classic back- ground for both disorders — a lack of attention from his mother and an early hospital stay (predisposing him to Munchausen's) and also a lengthy period of childhood physical and sexual abuse (predisposing him to both Munchausen's and MPD). His MPD symptoms appar- ently began early, with episodes of amnesia recalled from about age 6 — when the sexual abuse started — and he subsequently developed at least four new per- sonalities, although these were not identified until much later, when the patient, age 30, began to describe his per- sonal history to a therapist. His Munchausen's-type be- havior, which began when he was about 20, included the feigning or self-infliction of head injury, fever, anemia, deep vein thromboses, hypoglycemia, and urinary tract infection. G.C.Z.'s compulsive feigning or self-infliction of injuries seemed to have been carried out by an alter personality or personalities whose actions at the time were apparently unknown to the other personalities. Thus conscious and unconscious deception may mingle simultaneously within a single patient. T he co-existence of Munchausen's syndrome with Multiple Personality Disorder has been described in other patients, and may not be accidental. Goodwin\" re- ported the case of a married woman with children, who had a confirmed history of abuse by her father and step- father; the woman appeared to have several different personalities which variously acted out Munchausen's behavior, feigning and inflicting, injuries to herself, and Munchausen's-by-proxy behavior directed at her chil- dren. Goodwin cited several other contemporary and his- torical cases of apparent Munchausenian symptoms in MPD victims, including the remarkable case of a \"pos- sessed\" 17th-century Italian abbess, one of whose alter personalities, \"Jesus,\" was observed scratching her own flesh to simulate stigmata. Goodwin also has pointed out several behavioral parallels between MPD and Munchausen's, including frequent self-abusive actions, feigned or imagined somatic symptoms, histories of childhood abuse or trauma, histories of apparent lying, active imaginations and changeable accounts of their lives, the use of different names, and sudden, fugue-like disappearances. The reluctance of Munchausen's pa- tients to admit to their deceptive behavior also parallels the reluctance or amnesic inability of MPD patients to admit to the existence of their alter personalities. Goodwin has proposed that Munchausen's syndrome, currently classified as a chronic factitious disorder, should be reclassified as a dissociative disorder along- side MPD. The fact that Munchausen's-type patients have pre- sented falsely with war-related post-traumatic stress disorder, 18 and have falsely claimed satanic ritual abuse, 19 may be seen as reinforcing Goodwin's argument, since both PTSD and satanic ritual abuse claims have been as- sociated with dissociative disorders or tendencies. 20 (It also should be noted that PTSD has been described in some abductees, and that accounts of satanic ritual abuse often have similarities to accounts of abduction and gy- necological manipulation by aliens. 21 Of course, the unconscious falsification of disease has long been a feature of dissociative disorders, especially Multiple Personality Disorder, and even in the modern clinical setting the presentation of false symptoms by MPD patients often results in a diagnosis not of MPD but of hysteria. Thus, both the deliberate, and uncon- scious falsification of disease appear to have links to the dissociative disorders. T he dissociative disorders, as well as sub-clinical dissociative states and tendencies, have long been linked to a range of paranormal phenomena, including encounters with aliens. 22 At the same time, paranormal PAGE 16 NUMBER 301 MAY 1993"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL Modern Christian possession cases typically Involve multiple self-inflicted or psychosomat- ic Injuries and a history of childhood abuse or trauma. phenomena often have seemed to be^ complicated by, or even characterized by, deception. UFO \"contactees\" have appeared to engage in deliberate or unconscious trickery of apparently extraordinary complexity, min- gling prosaic methods with seemingly paranormal ones in an apparent effort to convince investigators of the re- ality of their experiences. 23 Spirit mediums whose pow- ers have seemed genuine on some occasions, have on other occasions been exposed as frauds. 24 The behavior of poltergeists, which seems to be characterized by childish, pranksterish, attention-getting or thrill-inducing mischief, tends to be associated with anxious adolescents and pre-adolescents 25 who are sometimes caught pro- ducing poltergeist effects by ordinary sleight-of-hand. 26 The ritual scarring of initiates in various pre-industrial cultures is often attributed to ancestor spirits or to other spiritual agents of transformation, even though such scarring, to anthropological observers, may appear to be inflicted by other tribesmen or by the initiate himself. 27 Similarly, it has been suggested that the talents of shamans and other primitive magicians consist chiefly in the ability to mythologize while performing minor sleight-of-hand tricks (thus suggesting the paleolithic ori- gins of stage-magic). Spirit-possession also has ap- peared at times to involve obvious, although not al- ways conscious, deception. Goodwin's possessed abbess is one example; other examples may be found in ac- counts of the various possession epidemics throughout Europe and the American colonies from the Middle Ages to the Enlightenment. 28 Anthropologists also have observed a high incidence of spirit-possession among women in non-western cultures where women under ordinary circumstances are expected to play a subordi- nate role. The spirit possessing such a woman com- monly demands, in exchange for its successful exorcism, that the woman be given various gifts or concessions by her husband or by other men. It is not always clear why there should be an associ- ation between the tendency to deceive or to play mis- chievous tricks and the tendency to have anomalous experiences, but a popular hypothesis is that some anom- alous experiences themselves are socially or psycho- logical meaningful forms of deception, predicated on the same psychological need or needs which drive more prosaic forms of deception. The anthropologist I.M. Lewis, for example, has argued that the diagnosis and treatment of spirit-possession among women in male- dominated cultures: gives women the opportunity to gain ends (material and non-material) which they cannot readily secure more directly. Women are, in effect making a special virtue of adversity and affliction and [are], often quite literally, capitalizing on their distress. 29 More modern (especially Christian) possession cases typically involve multiple self-inflicted or psychoso- matic injuries and a history of childhood abuse or trauma, and are often diagnosed as MPD. MPD itself has been explained as a defensive splitting-off from the original personality of separate personalities which per- sonify, sometimes as apparently physically separate en- tities, the (then-unintegratable) emotions generated by stressful situations. These emotions are frequently sadis- tic, harmfully mischievous, and even suicidal, and the re- lationship between split personalities may develop into an abuser-victim relationship, with one or more per- sonalities, apparently, using the considerable resources of mind and body (including deceptive techniques such as multi-sensory hallucinations and psychosomatic scar- ring) to abuse or to dominate the other personality or personalities—while all of the personalities conspire to keep their multiplicity a secret from outside observers. In possession cases, a number of profound paranor- mal phenomena such as psychokinesis, telepathy, mul- tiple-witness apparitions, and disembodied voices have been reported, usually in response to exorcism. If one in- terprets such displays as attempts by a dissociated per- sonality to frighten the exorcist and/or the core person- ality, and to convince them of the possessing spirit's reality, then one may see them also as meaningful forms of deception. This view would seem to be supported by the observation that the more bizzare and religiously meaningful possession phenomena tend to occur only when the patient has a religious background and when therapy is attempted in a religious setting i.e., not when a diagnosis of MPD is made and psychotherapy is at- tempted in a secular clinical setting. Other manifestations of the paranormal have been described as culturally or archetypally structured re- sponses to stress or to definite psychological needs. In many cultures shamans are selected from among chil- dren or adolescents with a history of frequent illness, usually (by modern western standards) psychiatric or neurological illness, and it has been suggested that shamanism itself is an adaptive form of psychiatric in- stability—in which hallucinatory and psychosomatic self-deceptions are transformed into (other-deceiving) in- struments of political, social, medicinal and spiritual power. From this perspective, although it is easy to over- simplify, one can speculate that shamanism and related sub-phenomena such as mediumship and possession originated within an early milieu of spiritual belief, as a system for exploiting that belief to overcome the obsta- cles of the existing social order. The original shamanic system would have had to be psychologically very co- ercive, since early social groups were probably domi- nated by physically powerful heterosexual males, MAY 1993 NUMBER 301 PAGE 17"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL whereas shamans whose \"magic\" could make them even more powerful often were homosexual, bisexual, sickly or female. 30 The power of the shamanic system by this reasoning, would have derived from the power of group belief in the spiritual, and from the linkage of this belief to the activities of the shaman. That the shaman's reper- toire would come to include deliberate deceptions and apparently mischievous mystifications to shore up belief in his powers and belief in the spiritual realm, would therefore have been unsurprising. Recalling the discussion of factitious disorders above, one might suggest that deceptive, Munchausenian be- haviors, from the self-infliction of injuries to the feign- ing of serious disease to the teaching of a child to mimic epileptic seizures, might once have had similar cultural power in a shaman-revering society; and in fact the an- thropological literature is full of stories of those who ap- parently feigned their way into a shamanic career. Taking this line of speculation a bit further, one might even propose that the induction of hypoxic seizures in a young child — so often reported in mothers who exhibit Munchausen's-by-proxy syndrome — is also an atavism of an ancient adaptive behavior, since such seizures, aside from their concomitant psychological trauma, would have imposed (or reinforced a familial) tendency to dissociate, thereby preparing the child for a much-de- sired shamanic vocation. Jung, who was well aware of the connection between paranormal experiences and dissociative states, also sought the origin of their relationship with deceptive be- havior. He noted the apparent parallels between the de- ceitful, mischievous activities of shamans, poltergeists, mediums and possessing \"demons,\" and suggested that each was a manifestation of an underlying behavioral ar- chetype — the \"shadow,\" or \"trickster\" — which itself was a remnant of an age of more primitive human con- sciousness. 31 Persinger has suggested alternatively that such mischievous behaviors might simply reflect more childish structures of consciousness — left behind by personal maturation but uncovered during dissociative episodes. 32 Perhaps both concepts are valid, and neu- ropsychological ontogeny recapitulates neuropsycho- logical phylogeny. In any case, clear examples of trick- sterish or hysterically deceptive behavior have been noted by various authors among mediumistic UFO con- tactees, in a spirit-medium and repeat UFO-sighting re- porter, and in two UFO abductees who exhibited, re- spectively, marked mediumistic and shamanic tenden- cies. T he problem of human deception tends to be avoided by researchers of anomalous phenomena. The prac- tical and philosophical difficulties in distinguishing de- ceptive from non-deceptive behavior are potentially in- surmountable, and researchers in any case may not wish to risk distressing or alienating the experiences of such phenomena, upon whom their research may depend. The problem of human deception tends to be avoided by researchers of anomalous phe- nomena. Researchers of alien abductions in particular are usually careful to avoid implying that their subjects may be de- liberately or even unconsciously deceitful. This avoid- ance is further supported by the belief that such decep- tion is rare.. That may be the case. However, I have argued that paranormal experiences may be linked to deceptive be- havior for several reasons. Firstly, deceptions such as the feigning, self-infliction and hysterical imagination of trauma appear to be interrelated. Secondly, these false traumas have links to dissociative states and disorders. Thirdly, the dissociative states and disorders are closely related to paranormal phenomena. Fourthly, paranor- mal phenomena have been associated empirically with deceptive and mischievous behaviors, including espe- cially the feigning, self-infliction and hysterical imagi- nation of trauma. In other words, there appears to be an interrelated complex of behaviors which includes de- ception, dissociation and paranormal phenomena. This is not to assert that all paranormal phenomena necessarily involve conscious or unconscious deception, but merely that such deception should be looked for. The fact that the alien abduction phenomenon is similar to other para- normal phenomena, both in its phenomenological details and in the psychological profiles of its experiencers, suggests that abduction accounts also should be scruti- nized.

A FEW EDITORIAL NOTES The theme of this issue could well be UFOs and decep- tion, since the latter word appears in the title of two of the articles, and since deception, in the form of human hoaxing, is now thought to be widespread in the crop cir- cle field. With a new season of circles just about to get underway, ufologists and cereologists alike would do well to tread lightly. The issue of deception, whether self-imposed or ex- ternally created, should concern us all. Rather than bellyaching after the fact, a little cautious skepticism of some paranormal claims might be called for in the first place. Due to space considerations, \"Current Cases\" and the \"MUFON Forum\" (letters-to-the-editor) section do not appear in this issue. Both will be back next time.

Three articles this time around deal with highly pure samples of magnesium reportedly recovered from the Ubatuba region of Brazil in the summer of 1957. in the wake of the aerial explosion of a UFO. While the results of detailed metallurgical analyses are still inconclusive, several intriguing issues are raised. How do we deter- mine beyond a shadow of a doubt, for example, that a particular physical specimen is indeed of extraterrestrial origin or nature? It's not as simple as it seems on the sur- face. In the case of the Ubatuba fragments, for instance, the specimens are too pure to make a convincing case for the argument that they might have been part of the outer shell of a physical flying saucer. As it turns out. at least in terms of terrestrial technology, magnesium is typically alloyed, i.e., combined with a \"lesser\" metal for the express purpose of making it more durable. Another particularly provocative article is \"How Children Portray UFOs\" by Linda Kerth and Richard F. Haines, based on an analysis of \"375 drawings of imag- ined UFOs by Swiss children ages 7-15.\" The results are revealing for a number of reasons, not the least of which is the fact that the children tended to portray typical \"little green men,\" as opposed to ubiquitous, standard-is- sue \"Grays.\" Say the authors: \"There was no evidence of imagery which might explain modern accounts of ab- ductions by small gray entities.\" Robert Hall, Mark Rodeghier and Donald Johnson also take a critical look at the recently released Roper Report, which seems to suggest that 2% of the adult American population (approximately 3.7 million indi- viduals) has been abducted at one time or another. The authors would have better put the conclusions of the Roper Report in perspective had they compared it to existing historical studies conducted by the British Society for Psychical Research, Father Andrew Greeley and company, and even the Gallup Poll. As it turns out, the Roper Report findings aren't all that extraordinary; they certainly aren't necessarily indicative of a physical abduction by extraterrestrial beings as Hopkins and Jacobs continue to imply in their own article in the same issue.
