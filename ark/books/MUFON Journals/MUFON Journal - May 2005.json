In the famous 1993 Australian case involving Kelly Cahill and other witnesses, traces included magnetic effects which corresponded to the reported shape of the object, as illustrated in the above printout (copyright Phenomena Research Australia).

On Feb. 5, 1971, Dr. Mitchell be- came the sixth man to walk on the Moon. lam personally proud of Dr. John Schuessler Mitchell's ac- complishments, and pleased that he will share some of his experiences with our symposium audience. I consider him a friend and one of our real space heroes. Some interesting facts about Dr. Mitchell include the following: When he earned his Doctorate from MIT, his thesis described a mission to Mars. Soul Travel Magazine quotes him as saying, \"It is time to release the con- straints on UFOs and extraterrestrial information that has been avoided or hidden by most nations, and/or in agreement with Extraterrestrials them- selves.\" He has never had first-hand experi- ences with ETs or the U FO phenom- ena. Rather, he relies on the testimony of trusted old timers and more modern government and military personnel whose official duties and need to know placed them in position to have such experiences. This is your opportunity to meet and hear one of the few people who have actually walked on another body in space -our Moon. Representative from Turkey to speak at Symposium Esen Sekerkarar, MUFON's Rep- resentative in the country of Turkey, will be presenting her work on the best evi- dence from Turkey. Esen graduated from Istanbul University where she studied Latin Language and Literature. She got involved in the UFO field in 1998 with the opening of the Sirius UFO Space Sciences Research Center.

Phillips Center for Physical Trace Research archaeoanom@inter-linc.net Introduction ^ • jhis report presents a statisti- I cal analysis of data presented -JL in 3,130 reports involving ob- servations of anomalous phe- nomena or objects on or near the ground resulting in physical effects generated by the observed phenom- ena or objects. These observations took place in 91 countries between 1490 and 2004. There are hundreds of additional possible trace sites which do not involve the observation of a UFO. All but the most significant of these events have been removed from this report; they are located in another catalog. The data in this report are based on events available in February, 2005. The analysis permits certain regulari- ties of these phenomena to be brought out, as the data indicates there is a cer- tain type of phenomenon which shows stable statistical properties. This research began in 1968, and af- ter 36 years it is yet premature to con- - sider the nature of these phenomena on the basis of the data presented to date. The development of methods of ob- taining more reliable data, and expan- sion of the initial information, wiU re- sult in a database of what I consider the most important piece of the UFO puzzle—physical evidence.. . General characteristics This report is not based on lights in the night sky or objects seen at great distance, but on unusual objects on or quite near the ground. Many of these events involve mul- tiple witnesses, observing objects under good viewing conditions, at close range, MAY 2005 details visible for extended periods of time, and/or object resting on the ground with known reference points be- hind and around them. Small humanoids and resulting foot- prints have been reported in a substan- tial number of cases. In terms of size, reports indicate small objects ranging from less than one meter to 3 meters in diameter, and an intermediate group of objects from 4m to 10m are often observed. Large ob- jects over 1 Om in diameter are seen at a reduced percentage of the total. There are many instances of animal and human effects, some quite severe, ranging from \"sunburn\" effects to seri- ous heat exposure. Animals, especially dogs, have a vio- lent reaction not only to the observed object but also to the resulting ground effects left behind. Most landing events involve obser- vations with the unaided eye, tew with any optical aids, and very few photo- graphs of landed or nearly landed ob- jects have been presented. Circumstances of observation The majority of cases involve wit- nesses going about their daily business, often a farmer, alerted by his dogs or by electromagnetic effects. In the high strangeness events, one finds the wit- nesses were skeptics prior to their ob- servation. . These witnesses usually want no pub- licity, and the investigator spends a great deal of time just locating them. When the witnesses are located, they will give up the information, but usually only on the conditions that their names and the location will not be revealed. Farmers and ranchers represent the majority of witnesses, as the observed objects seem to prefer isolated locations. This report will provide statistics re- lating to distribution of events by year, month, time, object and site details, and other relevant characteristics. Suggested future research To obtain more definite conclusions, more reliable and detailed data must be MUFON UFO JOURNAL About the author Ted Phillips is considered the top researcher in the world on UFO traces/effects. He worked closely with Dr. J. Allen Hynek for a num- - ber of years, and it was Dr. Hynek who suggested to Phillips that he specialize in landing traces. Ted has personally investigated more than 500 reports, and has com- piled a research file of more than 3,000 such cases. He is the founder and director of the Physical Trace Research Project, a former staff member of Skylook (forerunner of the MUFON UFO Journal), has presented seven papers at MUFON symposiums', and has worked closely with APRQ, NICAP, andCUFOS. His recent work includes a spe- cial project in Slovakia's well as ongoing cases in Missouri, .where he and wife Ginger make their home. Ted will be a regular columnist for the MUFON UF©/<w/: with the June issue:-. acquired. These events must be well documented, and the resulting effects sampled for laboratory analysis. There needs to be a central reposi- tory for physical evidence cases. Cur- rently, the data is scattered among many investigators and groups in many coun- tries. A central repository should produce interim reports available to the general public and serious researchers. This will produce new data and a much more complete database. Classification: types of objects The data indicates five major types of UFOs which land, or nearly land, and generate physical effects on their imme- diate surroundings. TYPE ONE Small objects, less than one meter in diameter. These represent 28% of the cases which include object dimensions."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"CASE EXAMPLE Missouri, 1978-isolated farm in SW MO; six adult witnesses observed a one- meter object resting on the ground from 0700 to 0900. Sunrise was at 0720, scattered thin clouds at 10,000 ft, light winds from the south. The field was illuminated by full sun from 0720 through 0900. Until 0850 the witnesses periodically observed the elliptical white object from the front window and front porch of the house, thinking it was a piece of metal that had blown into the field over- night. There was no apparent move- ment, and cattle stood in the area less than 100 feet from the object. At 0850 the farm owner and his son walked to a large barn located 100 feet from the house to get a tractor to pull the \"metal\" from the field. With four members of the family watching from the front porch, the two men started the tractor. As they did so, those on the porch began yelling as the small object started to ascend. At that point the men at the barn couldn't see the object, which was 120 feet from the opposite side of the structure. The object ascended slowly toward the north on a rather low angle trajec- tory, and the two men at_the barn ran beyond the building and watched the ascent from the east side of its flight path. As all six watched, they could see that it was rotating, showing a dark section at about two-second intervals. As the object silendy increased its rate of climb it made a turn to the right, followed by a sharp turn to the left, flying across the wind. There were no visible wings or en- gines, and no sound was heard as it passed within 165 feet of the witnesses on the porch: As they watched it climb, they noticed a much larger cylindrical object higher in the sky. The smaller object finally joined with the cylinder, which moved rapidly north. Where the object rested in the field they found a 1.5m slighdy oval area which was dehydrated. The grass was crushed and discolored, and inside that area were two small circular craters. Dust had been blowh from these cra- ters onto large-leafed plants, which were wilted, trapping the dust in the folded plants. Delphos, KS, circular trace. TYPE TWO Objects with an estimated diameter of 2m to 4m, these objects rarely make ground contact, generally hovering one to five feet above ground level. These objects make up 26% of the cases with estimated object dimensions. CASE EXAMPLE Canada, 1974—farmer of high cred- ibility swathing his rape seed crop at 1000, weather was overcast, low cloud ceiling with light showers. As he approached a slough which was covered with high, thick grass he noted what looked like a metal duck blind in the high grass. He stopped his swather some 50 feet from the slough and walked to the edge to investigate. As he stepped up to the edge of the grass he saw a metal domed object which was spinning at a high rate of speed. He could see dark \"grooves\" on the surface and a wide \"belt\" around the lower section. The object was five feet thick and eleven feet wide at the belt. At this point he became frightened and backed away from the spinning object. When he reached the swather he climbed up on to the seat, and from this MUFON UFO Journal higher angle he could now see four more objects of the same size and shape, all spinning, and he noted the grass beneath the five objects was moving violendy. The five objects were arranged in a semi-circle around the slough. The second object from him had two rod-like \"probes\" which extended from the base of the object into the grass. These rods were rotating and swirling the grass around them. He would later find two long disturbed areas extending from ring two. . As he watched, the five objects sud- / denly ascended in a set formation yerti-' cally. There was no sound, and underneath each of the five he could see two pipe- like extensions from which a burst of \"exhaust\" was seen. The wind from these blew off his cap. When they reached the cloud base they stopped, formed a perfect line, and went into the .clouds. At the site he found five rings, each swirled in a clockwise pattern with the central areas undisturbed. The rings measured 3.3, 3.1, 2.4, 3.0, 3.24m in diameter. He was so frightened he decided not May 2005"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"\\ to tell anyone about the event. His mother, seeing he was disturbed about some- thing, finally pushed him into telling his story. He then took his father to see the rings. His wife told her sister, she told her hus- band, he told his brother, and the brother called the RCMP. There was a detailed inves- tigation by the RCMP, and the lead investigator, Constable Ron Morier, told me: \"Yes, I believe that he saw some- thing, and I don't see why he would exaggerate what he saw. There is no way this is a hoax.\" He adds, \"It was in, the slough grounds, the grass was green and long, and it was un- disturbed except for the circles-and whatever was in there, it came out of the air . and departed the same way.\" One of the most signifi- cant UFO events, Delphos, KS, involved an object very similar to the Canadian UFOs. It too was domed at the top and flat at the bot- tom. It was six feet thick, and eight to ten feet in diameter with a belt or lip at the base. The circular trace measured 2.4m in diameter with the central area undisturbed. TYPE THREE 19% of the cases in which estimated dimensions were given are in this group. These * s objects were estimated to be '• 3m to 6m in length, generally - described as oval or egg- shaped with landing legs vis- ible. The objects often involved small humanoids, and left behind burnt or dehydrated traces and four imprints from the landing legs. CASE EXAMPLE New Mexico, 1964—the well known Socorro event in which police officer Zamora witnessed the descent of a bright flame below a shiny object. He arrived at the site to see MAY 2005 an oval object on four legs. He observed two small hu- manoids about 450 feet away in daylight. The object quickly as- cended with a roar and flames, became silent, and flew away on a horizontal tra- jectory. At the site were burned bushes and four im- prints. Less than two days later an identical object was observed at close range at La Madera, NM. It left behind a scorched site and four imprints which were almost identical to Socorro. See also Valensole, France. TYPE FOUR 16% of the reports de- scribe a typical flying saucer, estimated diameter of 7m to 10m. Usually described as having a metallic surface, sur- face details, and external lights. Landing legs are seen, usu- ally numbering three. These objects make ground contact, and humanoids are often re- ported. CASE EXAMPLE Australia, 1966-a well- known case with witness George Pedley observing an object at close range at 0900. He saw a light gray non-re- flecting dull object, estimated to be 25 feet long and 8 feet thick, rising vertically from marshland. It then climbed at a 45- degree angle from a height of about 30 feet above the sur- face. The object ascended at a point 75 feet from the wit- ness. He could hear a hissing sound as the object climbed. He described it as two sau- cers, edge to edge. A near circular depression remained in the swamp grass, the area measuring 32 feet long and 25 feet wide. The grass was flattened clockwise to the surface of the water, and reeds had been uprooted from the mud below. TYPE FIVE Objects described as larger than 10m in diameter represent the smallest per- centage at 11%. Again, these objects are described as classic saucers or as cylinder or cigar shaped. They are the largest objects observed generating traces. CASE EXAMPLE Uzbekistan, 1984—techni- cian Shamil Yuaihmetov and four other workers saw a ci- gar-shaped object at 2345 slowly descending at a 45- degree angle. They estimated the length to be more than 80 meters and the diameter at 25 to 30 meters. The object flew over the men and descended be- hind a hill. It emitted a slight hissing sound and appeared to be metallic. The next day an area was found in a vineyard with three rounded imprints or holes about 0.5m deep. They were in an equilateral triangle pattern, their shape indicating globe-like landing pads. An area of the vineyard 30m x 80m was destroyed. The event was investigated by S.P. Kuzionov, PhD, a member of the Geographical Society from Leningrad. The event was quite close to the Katta-Kurgan tactical nu- clear missile base. The mili- tary paid substantial attention to the incident.

This photo shows what observers described as a \"saucer nest\" over a small pond in Gnaratingueta, Sao Paulo, in December, 1996. UFOs had been reported hovering over the area tiro days before the \"nest\" was discovered. The Bra^il- ian Air Force reportedly videotaped the area for eight days. Brazilian doctor says she was told to cover up UFO injuries By Carlos Mendes Translated by Paulo Santos, Brazilian UFO Magazine www.ufo.com.br \"I've been compelled by the Brazil- ian Air Force to convince the locals that the lights attacking them were mass hal- lucinations, and that what they saw has never happened.\" This is the statement by Dr. Wellaide Cecim Carvalhothe, M.D. in public health and psychiatry, in discussing her role in the so-called \"suck-suck\" phe- nomenon, a weird episode that terrified many communities at Colares, Vigia, Santo Antonio do Taua, Mosqueiro e Baia do Sol, Brazil, at the end of 1977 and beginning of 1978. The victims called the encounters \"suck-suck\" because the lights seemed to suck blood from their bodies. Dr. Wellaide was responsible for a health care unit at Colares at that time, and treated about 80 victims of the mys- terious lights. \"I was the first one to make contact with the victims of the suck-suck phe- nomena,\" she says. \"In spite of being MUFON UFO JOURNAL 22 years old at that time and being com- pletely skeptical, I started to notice changes the medicine failed to explain.\" She notes, \"The burns on the victims' skin were almost always on the neck and the breast, with two small and parallel holes, as if it was a little bite, but it wasn't.\" Dr. Wellaide Cecim says that after 60 days of daily records covering more than 120 cases, she started to report these cases to her superiors. But she wasn't prepared for their reaction: She was for- bidden to admit something strange was happening. \"But, being faithful to what I see, not to what I hear, I kept on speaking,\" she explains. \"Even under the risk of being fired.\" Following is the interview she gave to me, a journalist from O Liberal, published by the Brazilian UFO Maga- %ine and added to its campaign UFOs Freedom of Information Now, which is described at: www.ufo.com.br/ secrecy.php. Interview Question — The authorities didn't 7"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"see the phenomena, but even seeing they wouldn't believe... Wellaide —They didn't even pay me a visit. I had to discover that the vic- tims lost erythrocytes all by myself. I've always tried to do my best in my job. I noticed because of the research I made to find out why these people had giddi- ness, sluggishness, could hardly walk, and had lost blood. I sent several re- ports to the health secretary. Question — And who was the health secretary? Wellaide — Dr. Manoel Ayres. My immediate superior was Dr. Luiz Flavio Figueiredo. He forbade me to talk, make suggestions, or even agree with the lo- cals. But you don't need medical knowl- edge to know. Necrosis occurs only 96 hours after a burn. The victims' burns had necrosis immediately, just five min- utes after the attack. Question — What's the explanation for this? Wellaide — That's when it all be- gins: they (the flying objects pilots) couldn't be Russians because it doesn't match their technology at that time, and nobody could make burns in that way. Question — As a psychiatrist, do you believe these people could be vic- tims of a mass hysteria? Wellaide — This is what the Air Force always asked me to say. There was not any kind of mass hysteria or visual hallucinations. The psychiatry proves it didn't happen. It may happen when people commit mass suicide. But no- body can have the same delirium, the same visual, sonic, and synesthetic hal- lucination at the same time and in dif- ferent places. Question — Who asked the Air Force to investigate the case? Wellaide — Once nobody helped, much the opposite, and they told me to shut up; the Colares mayor at that time, Mr. Alfredo Ribeiro Bastos, called the Brazilian Air Force. And from Parana came the president of the ufology soci- ety of that state, the philosopher, ufologist, and biomedical Daniel Rebisso Giese. We wrote the first book on this sub- ject: Vampires and extraterrestrials in Amazonia. The priest of C9lares and also a doctor, Alfredo de la 6, now de- ceased, also called for help. Question — What hurt you most? Wellaide — It was the fact that, 22 years old and responsible for a health care unit, I had a lot of people needing research to find out why they were im- mobilized. Why they couldn't walk or talk. And when I looked at the hemo- gram to compare the last records, I've learned they had very low rates of eryth- rocytes and hemoglobin. The fact is, no object can bring out skin necrosis after a burn so fast. A third factor is the alopecia, the fall of hair from the skin, in a way it will never grow again. The victims have never had hair on the burned skin again. Question — And when did the Air Force appear? Wellaide — 90 days after our re- quests. When Colares was empty and scared, they came. Because of the dic- tatorship we were under, they used to call me every day to ask me to speak to the people, to try to convince them they were having mass hallucination, but I always refused. Question — Under all this pressure from the military, what did you do? Wellaide — I always told them I wouldn't obey. I disagreed with them when they said I was afraid of being considered a fool. I really don't mind. I gave interviews to several TVs from Brazil, EUA, and Europe, even under the risk of being fired. Besides being a skeptic, I'm totally sure of what I saw. I don't know what it is, but I know it's real. Question — Did you, as did the cap- tain Uyrange Hollanda, the investigation commander, see beings from space? Wellaide — Yes I did. It was 5 PM in the afternoon at Colares. There was a ship at 50 meters of altitude, above the city's main street. Inside of this ship there was a being, 1.20 or 1.30 meter high. This happened when I was driving to help a child with a broken clavicle. I was going to immobilize her. They were flying so low that I was completely un- able to react. I could see the UFO's bright metal, and it wasn't a dish-like object, but much more like a cone or a cylinder. Its course was elliptical. At 5 o'clock in the afternoon your eyes can't play tricks on you. You may have visions, hallucinate, but besides me, many others would have to. Question — Did someone die after being sucked by the lights? Wellaide — Two persons I took to the hospital in the capital, Belem, died. I took them in my car. And when they MUFON UFO Journal One of the Colares victims. gave me the death certificate, I could read \"unknown reason.\" The victims had the burns, the tiny holes, die ex- amination. I mean, it's very easy to hide things in this country. Some amazing cases Operation Saucer collected reports from the people who saw the lights. Fishermen, rural workers, simple and ordinary people hit by the lights were interviewed by the Brazilian Air Force's personnel between November of 1977 and the beginning of 1978. What they told is written in a report called Operation Saucer. The Air Force's document was signed by Capt. Uyrange Hollanda and obtained by the newspa- per 0 Liberal. More than 230 pages of the Opera- tion Saucer main report were fully scanned and are published at the website of the Brazilian UFO Magazine. They can be downloaded freely at www.ufo.com.br/documentop.php.

J Case 1 — Adelaide Pereira da Silva, 37 years old, illiterate. Place: Colares, Oct. 16,1977,21:00 hours. She noticed a reddish glow lighting her room and all the interior of the house. All the doors and windows were closed. Then she opened a window to see a bright object with a bluish light moving slightly above the trees (about 30 meters). She felt a strong pain in the eyes, and her body became numb. She carried these symptoms for several days. Case 2 — Maria Celeste Pereira da Silva, 20 years old, educated. Her UFO sighting happened on Oct. 18,1977, at May 2005"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"22:00 hours. At the same time that her mother, Adelaide, noticed a strange light coming inside her house, she felt a great pain all over her body, as if she were being heavily compressed. Also a numb feeling started to rise through her body, coming from the feet, and a strong heat appeared, spreading from the right shoulder to the head. She thinks she had been hit on the right side of the body by a beam of reddish light. Case 3 — Maria Francisca Furtado, 30 years old, primary school education only. She told what happened in the night of Oct. 18,1977, about 21:30. She lives close to a village called Vila Nova do Ubintuba. As the attacks were becoming more common, she and her husband used to come every night to Mr. Miguel Arcangelo Scares' house in order to sleep together with several families. On that day, she was hit by the light beam and got half-paralyzed. She felt a kind of electric shock. First, her feet became hot and a shiver took over her body, from the feet to the head. She felt the right part of her body be- came numb, and this sensation endured for one hour. Then came the headache and fever. Se did not go outdoors, so she couldn't see the \"ship.\" Men and women had the same symptoms after seeing the object. Case 4 -• — A farmer called Abel Soares Trindade, 28 years old, was in- side his house listening to the radio when something happened. It was about half past nine on the night of Sept. 14, 1977, when he noticed a bluish light coming from the roof. He became half-paralyzed, and had \\_ a feeling as if his head was growing big- \\ ger. He struggled to cry for help, for he \\ could hardly speak. For several days af- \"• ter the attack he had headaches and hoarseness. His wife, America Silva Soares, 23 years old, had the same symp- toms. Case 5—Another report came from Raimundo Nonato Barbosa, 48 years old. He said that when he was coming back home through the woods, as he passed by a friend's house, he suddenly felt as if he lost his strength. The shoes he was carrying in his hand fell to the ground. He picked them up and kept walking. The shoes fell to the ground again. When he lowered to pick them up again he could see a bright object, with a MAY 2005 round shape like a sea-ray, just above his shoulder. It was about 1.5 meters and moved .at very low altitude, about five or ten meters over the ground. The object was emitting a light beam, as a flash lamp, very strong and bluish colored, towards him. Very scared, Raimundo gathered his strength and ran to his friend's house, crying for help. Looking back, he watched the object rise in the sky, be- tween the trees, leaving bright and mul- ticolored sparks behind. He complained of shivering, head- ache, and numbness in the region of the body hit by the light beam. He did not report symptoms of burning. He showed what the object looked like by drawing on the ground. He represented the bright sparks us- ing three vertical lines with about 20 de- grees between them. He drew small circles connected to these lines and said they were lights in several colors. He couldn't repeat the drawing on paper. Case 6 — Five men told the military they could see two beings inside the ship. An encounter of the first kind with five men of Colares and a ship with extra- terrestrial beings inside would have taken place on Oct. 12, 1977, at 23:30. In the report the farmer, Manoel Espirito Santo, 20 years old, primary school education, told the military that he was in front of his house with his friends, Julio, Paulo, Deca, and Carlito, when he noticed a yellow light moving in the sunset direction. It slowed down, almost stopping by them, about 20 meters away. Manoel said he could see the light had two \"pi- lots.\" They seemed to be human. The \"man\" was at the left side, and the \"woman\" at the right side. Both were wearing something simi- lar to glasses on their eyes, and had com- munication equipment. The man on the left raised his \"glasses,\" as if staring at the witnesses, and at this very moment the other pilot, using a lateral pipe, sent a red light beam to-them. The moment he was hit by the light, Manoel felt a strong shock, as if it was an electric shock. The sensation started on the feet and rose to his head. Then he got his legs and arms paralyzed and almost lost consciousness. The ship went away slowly, then speeded up. Manoel could move again, but felt numbness for several minutes. MUFON UFO JOURNAL From far away, the ship looked like a red and yellow-colored star. It changed its color from bright yel- low to red and, when it was closer, he could see a bluish light on the frontal upper part. It was cylinder-shaped, like a barrel, and had a frontal smaller pipe, reddish colored, and a thinner one on its side, 45 degrees apart, where the bluish light was coming from. It was about 1.20 to 1.40 meters, seemed transparent on the bluish part and had a division between the pilots. Louisiana sighting appears to involve Air Force cover-up By Guy R. McDonald Submitted by Scott Arnett, MUFON Section Director, Louisiana The following UFO incident hap- pened a long time ago. Some details are fuzzy, but I'll try to be as clear as I can. I am a 71-year-old retired male. At this point, I am in sound mind and in relatively good heath. In July, 1948, I enlisted with the U.S. Army and served two tours of duty in Europe as an artil- lery gunnery instructor and horizontal control specialist. After my discharge in August, 1952, I worked in the insurance and music in- dustries and in journalism. The incident At about 5:30 AM, about mid-August, 1959, one Ross Vasquez (now deceased) and I prepared to launch my boat for a day of fishing at the Friendly Fisherman in Plaquemines Par- ish, LA. The marina is about 7 miles west of Highway 23 south on the Myrtle Grove Canal. Conditions, as I recall, were no wind, temperature about 80 degrees, hu- midity very high, a few scattered clouds; there was a moon, but I cannot remem- ber its stage. At the launch was its owner, Mr. A.C. (Buddy) Faulkner and his teenage son. As I prepared to launch the boat, my attention was drawn to a point to the southeast, on the horizon of the marsh. Mr. Vasquez, Mr. Faulkner, his son, and I observed a bright, round, shimmering (Continued on Page 16)"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"Part 2 The twenty all-time best cases from California By Preston Dennett ELEVEN: The contactees While some UFO researchers would prefer to forget this strange chapter of UFO history, there is no denying its pro- found influence on the UFO movement. The contactee movement began in southern California in the early 1950s when amateur astronomer George Adamski claimed to have seen, photo- graphed, and been taken onboard a fly- ing saucer piloted by friendly human- looking extraterrestrials. His story touched a nerve, and elec- trified the public. Adamski became an instant celebrity, writing books, giving lectures, and attracting wide audiences. Before long, many other contactees converged on southern California, all with similar claims. California became the place to be if you were interested in UFOs. Daniel Fry, Orpheo Angelucci, George Van Tassel, Frank Stranges, and others all claimed to have made contact with ETs. They also all wrote books and lec- tured widely. Each of the stories had the same theme—warnings from the ex- traterrestrials that humans are too war- like, that nuclear weapons are danger- ous, that we must not pollute.our envi- ronment, and other philosophical mes- sages—all of which today remains a prominent theme in modern abduction accounts. The ETs were usually described as human-looking, attractive, and originat- ing from various planets in our solar system. Often the stories seemed to contain information that is believed by mainstream science to be false (for ex- ample: life existing on the moon and other planets in our solar system.) And yet, the cases also have consid- erable corroborating evidence, includ- ing photos or multiple eyewitness testi- monies. 10 Number Ten: Topanga Canyon . This series These 20 best cases have been compiled by Dennet, a MUFON In- vestigator, from his latest book, UFOs Over California, Schiffer Publishing Ltd, 4880 Lower Valley Road, Atglen, PA 19310, info@schifferbooks.com, 6x9, soft cover, 224 pgs, $14.95 plus $3.95 shipping. Cases 20 through 12 appeared in the April issue. One example is the case of Sid Padrick of Watsonville, who reportedly experienced a contact with friendly hu- man-like ETs on Jan. 30,1965. Padrick said he was taken inside a craft and told that the ETs had a Utopian-like society with no illness or crime. While Padrick's claims were incred- ible, he was well known in his commu- nity. Also, at the time of his experience the mayor of Monterey, George Clemens, and numerous park rangers in the area reported UFOs. Padrick was eventually contacted by the Air Force, who interviewed him and reportedly asked him to not talk pub- licly about his encounter. Says Padrick, \"There were certain details they asked me not to talk about publicly, but I think MUFON UFO Journal in telling it that everything should be dis- closed.\" While the contactee enigma is con- troversial and has divided investigators, the movement was extremely popular and is responsible for introducing count- less people to the subject of UFOs. The annual Giant Rock conference held annually throughout the 1950s and 1960s in the southern California desert still holds the record for the largest gath- ering of UFO enthusiasts, attracting at one point more than 5,000 people. While many people consider the contactee movement to be a product of,/ the 1950s, it continues today. A good' example is Los Angeles reporter Philip Krapf, who has written two recent books about his own experiences with friendly ETs. TEN: The Topanga Canyon wave On June 14,1992, the small commu- nity of Topanga Canyon experienced an enormous wave of UFO activity involv- ing hundreds of objects. On that evening, at least 17 independent adult witnesses reported incredible encoun- ters throughout the canyon. Ten witnesses in five different ve- hicles driving along the boulevard that May 2005"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"evening were all \"buzzed\" or \"tail-gated from above\" by large glowing objects. One driver pulled over and observed dozens of objects coming out of a larger mother ship. Another one of the ve- hicles was picked up inside a beam of light, causing a period of missing time. The witnesses called the police and reported their encounters. As the driver said, \"I'm telling you, I've never been more frightened in my life.\" Other witnesses were inside their homes where they observed bright beams of light coming from above, or oval-shaped glowing objects darting back and forth across the sky. One couple was awakened from a sound sleep when an object hovered low over their home and lit up the entire interior. Another couple living high in the canyon observed more than 200 objects over a period of three hours. This particular wave was one of the strongest to ever hit California, and it remained strong for at least two more years, producing more than 50 addi- tional reports of all kinds, including sightings, landings, UFO-car chases, UFO-helicopter chases, face-to-face encounters, missing time abductions, onboard experiences, possible animal mutilations, cryptozoological creatures, and more. • While the main wave was from 1992- 1994, the area has a long history of en- counters, starting in 1942. From that point, the cases increased quickly, with two cases in the 1950s, two in the 1960s, 15 in the 1970s, 14 in the 1980s, and at least 47 in the 1990s. A June 14, 1992, encounter was listed in Timothy Good's book Alien Update as one of the best reports for the year. Today the area continues to be one \\ of California's few major UFO \"hotspots, with sightings as recent as 2004. NINE: California airships In late 1896, northern California ex- perienced its first recorded UFO wave. In fact, as researcher Richard Dolan writes, it \"represented the first UFO wave—though it would be 55 years be- fore anyone used the term.\" From October to December, 1896, thousands of residents of the cities of San Francisco, Sacramento, Stockton, and Oakland observed one or more zeppelin-like objects that glided at low elevations over the city, sending down MAY 2005 Number Eight: Heflin photos powerful beams of lights. Several of the witnesses reported seeing human- looking figures on board. Others heard distinct voices. As one witness, Charles Ellis, said, \"It hovered effortlessly and looked like a strange bird with four rotor wings, traveling about 20 miles an hour...I didn't want to believe it. was an airship. I had always regarded such reports as a joke. But now I have no choice but to believe them.\" The airship mystery is important be- cause people had never been confronted with the idea of extraterrestrials. As Dolan writes, \"The idea of spaceships from another world wasn't popularly considered, and would not be until the late 1940s...Most thought they were merely seeing a man-made object.\" While the sightings originated in Cali- fornia, they soon spread across the United States. The strange objects be- came front-page news and caused a media sensation. Interestingly, zeppe- lins were invented only a few years later. These initial reports, however, remain a mystery. While they have many simi- larities to modern reports, many inves- tigators are baffled by the dirigible-like appearance of the objects. Some researchers (ie: Jacques Vallee, Jerome Clark) have pointed to the air- ship wave as evidence that UFOs \"track\" cultures, and have an explana- tion other than extraterrestrial. What- ever the case, the sightings marked the beginning of California's involvement with the UFO phenomenon. EIGHT: Rex Heflin photos On Aug. 3,1965, some of the world's most famous and best-verified UFO photographs were taken by Los Ange- MUFON UFO JOURNAL les County Highway Investigator Rex Heflin. At that time, the entire United States was experiencing an intense coun- trywide wave of UFO activity. While driving outside of Santa Ana, Heflin observed a silent hat-shaped UFO approaching his truck. He radi- oed his supervisor, but then the radio went dead (a fact later confirmed by his supervisor.) As part of his job, Heflin carried a Polaroid camera. He quickly snapped a series of four photos before the object moved away. While he sought no pub- licity, reporters from United Press In- ternational heard about the photos and persuaded Heflin to turn them over, and UPI photo experts conducted an exten- sive analysis, even returning to the site of the incident and attempting to restage the event. They declared the photos genuine, and the pictures were published in the Santa Ana Register. The photos electri- fied the public, and Heflin's case became an instant classic. Not surprisingly, the Air Force declared the case a hoax. Heflin, however, later received a visit from two men claiming to be from NORAD. The men demanded the pho- tographs, and Heflin turned them over. The story gets more complicated from this point. However, numerous other studies of the photos have since been conducted. NICAP photographic analyst Ralph .Rankow and a team of other specialists studied the photos in detail and declared them genuine. Journalist Frank Edwards calls the photos \"the best UFO photographs in civilian hands.\" The photos are still con- sidered genuine, and among the most widely-published of all UFO photo- graphs. SEVEN: UFO destroys missile On Sept. 15, 1964, a crew of 120 military personnel at Vandenburg AFB prepared for the launch of an Adas F missile. The launch took place as sched- uled, but at about 60 miles of altitude the missile mysteriously malfunctioned and plunged into the Pacific Ocean. Dr. Robert Jacobs (then a lieutenant) was in charge of filming the missile launch with a telescopic camera hooked to a radar display that kept- the viewfinder locked on the missile. The next day, his superiors called in 11"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"Jacobs to view the film. To his shock, he observed \"a round object\" hovering next to the missile. Says Jacobs, \"It flew right up to our missile and emitted a vivid flash of light. 'Then it altered course and hovered briefly over our missile.. .and then there came a second vivid flash of light. Then the UFO flew around the missile twice and set off two more vivid flashes from different angles, and then it vanished. A few seconds later, our missile was malfunctioning and tumbling out of control.\" Jacobs was ordered to remain silent about what he saw. He dutifully kept silent for 17 years before he finally went public with his story. Despite his ster- ling reputation, he was immediately at- tacked by arch skeptics/debunkers Phil Klass and James Oberg. He also received numerous death threats, lost his employment, and his mailbox was destroyed with skyrockets following another threat. Investigators, however, located Jacobs' superior, Ma- jor Mansmann, who, on multiple occa- sions, confirmed the details of Jacobs account. This account is one of several in which UFOs have shown their capabil- ity to affect even our most advanced technology. It also shows evidence of the UFO cover-up. SIX: Cororiado mass encounter This case was originally uncovered and inves'tigated by UFO researcher Yvonne Smith. In mid-March, 1994, the TRIAD UFO conference was held in Coronado, featuring several leaders in UFO research. A few hundred people were in atten- dance. Seven of the attendees were stay- N ing at the nearby Village Inn in three adjacent rooms. As UFO researchers know, it is very unusual to uncover an abduction case involving more than one or two people. However, in the middle of the night of March 15, these seven witnesses simul- taneously experienced a visitation by several gray-type ETs who came into their hotel room and abducted at least two of the witnesses. What makes this case unique is not only the large number of independent witnesses (all of whom have provided extensive interviews), but the medical evidence. All of the witnesses have a lifelong 12 history of UFO encounters, and each of them has experienced a wide variety of physical symptoms, including punc- ture wounds, cuts, bruises, scratches, flu-like symptoms, high-blood pressure attacks, multiple infections, scoop-like scars, and more. One of the witnesses has undergone an operation by Dr. Roger Leir, DPM, to have an apparent implant removed. The implant was placed in her leg dur- ing their Coronado encounter. An analysis of the object has shown it to contain many unusual properties. Two of the other witnesses, Laurie Angelone and Mike Evans, have gone public with their experiences. Evans has undergone extensive medical examina- tions, including X-rays and MRIs, which show evidence of several foreign bod- ies in his head and legs. Says Evans, \"I have one [foreign body] around my left ear. One around the pituitary, sitting on top of the lim- bic system. And the other one is in the occipital.. .I've had doctors and radiolo- gists tell me that they don't know what it is.. .1 have things in my head—things which nobody seems to be able to explain.. .which I can't get rid of with- out major brain surgery. Where does that leave me?\" Dr. Leir has examined Evans and verified his post-abduction symptoms. Says Leir, \"I have known Mike for many years now and can personally attest to the physical finding.s such as bruises and scratches on his skin.\" While this case has not yet been pub- lished, it has accumulated an impressive amount of evidence. Says Dr Leir, \"The number of mass abductions are sparse in the literature, and this case will be ranked high on the scale of importance.\" The case is also the subject of a full- length book by Mike Evans and me, soon to be released by Galde Press. FIVE: Tujunga Canyon abductions Among the first abduction cases to be professionally researched and writ- ten about are the 1953 Tujunga Can- yon contacts. The case involved two southern Cali- fornia ladies, Sara Shaw and Jan Whit- ley, who experienced a missing time episode while staying in their remote cabin in Tujunga Canyon. They later located southern Califor- nia investigator Ann Druffel, who, along with D. Scott Rogo, Dr Bill McCall, and others, conducted an extensive investi- MUFON UFO Journal gation into the case. Today, most of the details of the case are commonly re- ported, such as the medical examina- tion, star maps, highly technological equipment, telepathic hairless entities...and so on. At the time, however, UFO abduc- tions were considered to be extremely rare events, with only a few recorded cases. Investigators were impressed by the many details that corresponded with other cases that had not been published, such as that of Betty Andreasson. Some of these details include a strange stillness preceding the encoun- ter, levitation of entities, movement through solid objects, telepathic com- munication, the medical examination, the appearance of the ETs, and many other details. As Druffel and Rogo write, \"The similarities are even more striking when one realizes that these two abductions occurred so far apart in time and locale.\" Another detail that was first revealed in the Tujunga Canyon case is the fact that encounters can be contagious. As Druffel and Rogo wrote in 1980, \"We know of no other case in the ar- chives of ufology typified by the odd 'contagion' phenomenon that seems to have spread from Sara and Jan to Emily, and then to Lori and Jo. This fact tends to make the vastly complicated Shaw- Whitley case even more important to our eventual understanding of the UFO mystery.\" Today, the many details first revealed in the Tujunga Canyon case and the few others that preceded it have been con- firmed numerous times in the hundreds of cases that followed. FOUR: Red Bluff encounter / On Aug. 13, 1960, and for the next' five days, California experienced one of the most intense UFO waves ever re- corded. The wave was centered over the northern California town of Red Bluff, but actually encompassed Willow Creek, Concord, Corning, Eureka, Pleasant Hill, Healdsburg, Santa Rosa, Roseville, Mineral, Dunsmuir, Honeydew, and Redlands. It all began at 10:05 PM on Aug. 13 when Deputy Sheriff Clarence Fry of Red Bluff observed a large glowing ob- ject over the Red Bluff prison. Two hours later, two other patrol officers observed a large glowing object hover- May 2005"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"now-famous photograph of the object on its front page. The military attempted to enact a cover-up, stating that no objects were seen. They then said that balloons were responsible. The incident, however, was witnessed by several thousand people, making it the most widely viewed UFO sighting in Cali- fornia history. It eventually caused the first congressional investiga- tion into the subject of UFOs. A later de-classified AT , ~, „ , r T * , memorandum from General Number Three: Battle of Los Angeles Geofge Marshall tQ p resident ing 200 feet above their vehicle. The Roosevelt says, in part, \".. .unidentified airplanes, other than American Army or Navy planes, were probably over LA, and were fired on by the elements of the 37 th CA Brigade between 3:12 and 4:15 am.\" While the \"planes\" were suspected to officers alerted neighboring sheriff's sta- tions and took off chasing the object. Meanwhile, law enforcement officers in numerous other cities also observed the same or different objects. At the same time, hundreds of calls poured in from citizens. Researcher Paris Flammonde calls this wave, \"One of the most impres- sive multiple sightings.\" Researcher James Harder, Ph.D, was so impressed by the case that on July 29, 1968, he delivered an official paper in support of the case to the Commit- tee on Science and Astronautics, House of Representatives, United States Con- gress. Incredibly, Air Force Blue Book of- ficials labeled the case as \"atmospheric inversion\" without any investigation. Still, this case remains one of the most intense waves in California history. THREE: Battle of Los Angeles In February of 1942, only a few months after the bombing of Pearl Har- bor, Los Angeles experienced a visita- tion by dozens of unknown objects, one large one which hovered over the city for a period of at least six hours. The incident caused an enforced to- tal blackout, and the military was called in to fire upon the strange object. By order of General Marshall, 1,430 rounds of ammunition were fired at the object, which apparently sustained no damage. Numerous searchlights were trained on the craft, which was also photo- graphed. Six people died of heart at- tacks, car-accidents, or falling debris. The next day, the LA Times printed a MAY 2005 be Japanese, no evidence of this has ever turned up. Nor do the descriptions given by witnesses corroborate with this theory. To this day, the case remains unsolved. TWO: Implant removal surgeries On Aug. 19, 1995, one of the most important events in UFO history took place in a doctor's office in Ventura, CA. At 5 PM on that day, Dr Roger Leir, DPM, performed three surgeries to re- move alleged \"alien implants\" from the bodies of three abductees. The surgeries were successful, and the three \"implants\" were recovered and sent off for scientific analysis. This, however, was only the begin- ning. Further successful surgeries fol- lowed. By 2003, Leir and his team had performed nearly a dozen surgeries. In each case, the procedures were success- ful and the implants were recovered. Here's where the story gets incred- ibly interesting. The studies of the im- plants are showing remarkable features that may eventually provide conclusive proof of extraterrestrial intervention. Some of the unusual features include a similar or identical appearance of im- plant from patient to patient, the pres- ence of an electromagnetic field com- ing from the implants, strong magnetic properties, fluorescence, a composition that is elementally similar to meteorites, a lack of inflammatory or foreign body MUFON UFO JOURNAL response in surrounding human tissues, and more. The complete story is told in Leir's groundbreaking book, The Aliens and The Scalpel, though the research is still on- going. The surgeries have rocked the UFO community. Budd Hopkins writes, \"Dr. Roger Leir has finally and dramatically laid his cards on the table. His carefully documented surgical removal of pos- sible alien implants can no longer be ignored. It may well turn out to be of extraordinary importance.\" Raymond Fowler writes, \"Dr. Leir is to be praised for his pioneering research into the removal and analysis of sus- pected alien implants. Only peer review and acceptance separate his findings from the proverbial 'smoking gun' of physical evidence for the abduction phe- nomenon.\" Whitley Strieber writes, \"Sometimes the whole world knows when a history figure makes his history...Dr. Roger Leir is such a historical figure. The time will come when the extraordinary break- through that he has made is noted in every textbook...the evidence is here... so overwhelmingly powerful that a sane person cannot easily deny that it is real.\" Dr. Leir himself writes, \"If these sci- entifically derived results are not disproven by subsequent analysis, then we can safely conclude that some indi- viduals with abduction histories have ar- tificially manufactured objects in their bodies of a demonstrably extraterres- trial origin. In short, we now have the 'smoking gun' of ufology—the hard physical evidence of a continuing alien presence on Earth!\" ONE: Edwards AFB visitations Many California military bases have been associated with UFOs, including George, Hamilton, Norton, Miramar, Castle, Alameda, and others. Of all of them, however, Edwards Air Force Base (formerly Muroc) tops the list. Located in the vast Mojave Desert, this area has attracted an incredible amount and variety of UFO activity from 1947 to the present day. In fact, the events at Edwards AFB are of such a magnitude that they may rival even the Roswell incident. The story begins on July 7,1947. On that day, the base experienced a series of seven fly-overs by UFOs as wit- 13"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"nessed by dozens of military officers and pilots. Listed as Blue Book case number 50 (unidentified), this encoun- ter changed the way the Air Force handled UFOs. As researcher Michael David Hall writes, \"Those disc sightings over Muroc on the seventh and eight really shook up the Pentagon, [and] were the pivotal event which sprung the United States military into serious action on the saucer mystery...the incident led the United States Army Air Force to issue classified orders requiring reports of any 'saucer-like' objects to be given to the Technical Intelligence Division of the Air Materiel Command.\" Researcher Richard Dolan writes, \"The Muroc incident continues to pro- vide evidence for military knowledge, interest, and secrecy regarding UFOs.\" This, however, was only the first sighting. Over the next 50 years the base would be visited again and again by UFOs, including in 1952, 1954, 1958, 1965, 1967, 1978, 1995, 1998, and more. Several of these sightings were made by extremely reputable witnesses, in- cluding Air Force base officers, and on one occasion, astronaut Gordon Coo- per. In 1958, Cooper was at the base when a UFO landed on the dry lake bed. Base personnel filmed the incident, and Cooper viewed the developed film. As he says, \"Good close-up shots. Nothing like I had ever seen...double inverted saucer shape. It didn't have any wings on it or anything.. .There was no doubt in my mind that it was made someplace other than Earth.\" Another noteworthy incident oc- curred on Oct. 7, 1965, during which several jets were scrambled to intercept UFOs which were hovering over the base. As researcher Steven Greer writes, 'This extremely important case involves a seasoned Air Force traffic controller, an official TJFO officer,' four separate radar stations, lock-on from onboard radar on a jet interceptor, many hours, and many objects over several hours. \"The debunkers and those who would ridicule the UFO matter need to be able to explain away all of these ele- ments—and the voice tape of the actual event.\" While the sightings, UFO-airplane chases, and landings are enough to place Edwards at the top of this list, the story doesn't end there. At this point, things become very controversial. According to a growing number of sources, on Feb. 20, 1954, President Eisenhower visited Edwards AFB, where he and other high-ranking offi- cials had an alleged face-to-face diplo- matic meeting with extraterrestrials. Numerous researchers have looked into the story. At this point, however, the whole truth remains obscured. Beyond that (if that isn't enough) there are also claims of crashed UFOs, reverse engineering of UFO hardware, and even actual live aliens working at the base along with humans. While these stories remain.on the fringe of UFO research, the stories continue to circulate. A few conclusions As with any list, there are other en- counters/events that could just as eas- ily have included, and another investi- gator would probably come up witii a different and equally valid list. All of the above cases, and many more, are presented in my book in de- tail. Although I've been investigating UFOs for years, I am still shocked by how many cases there are. My other big surprise was just how much evidence there is in support of UFOs. Minnesota women encounter strange entities on highway By William I. McNeff Minnesota State Director Location: near Duluth, MN Date: Aug. 7, 1979 Witnesses: two The primary witness was referred to me by her cousin, a former missionary, who is a friend of mine arid of my wife. Our friend vouched for the honesty of the witness. Our friend and her husband told me that the details of her account never varied over the years. I can confirm the consistency between my interview of the witness and her journal account of 1979. The witness is now retired. At the time of the encounter, the wit- ness (\"Liz\") was about 50 years old and employed by a well-known company. A group of her co-workers were planning to hold an evening bridal, shower for another co-worker at their manager's home at Caribou Lake. The witness' house had needed paint- ing, so she and her husband had taken a week of vacation time to work on the project. The weather during the day was. \"perfect,\" and after hours of work she picked up a co-worker, \"Ruth,\" and they drove to the shower at Caribou Lake. Liz recorded the details in a journal the next day. Liz and Ruth left the party at about 9:10 PM. She reports, \"It was dark enough by this time that I drove with the lights on from the lake to the black- topped Munger Shaw road, and stopped at the crossroad by the Caribou Lake school. \"We both noticed three figures zig-zagging over the center line straight ahead—in my judgement maybe 11/2 mile. Ruth said, What in the world is going on down there?' I said, 'It looks like three little ones on bikes, but they'd better move, cause here I come.' \"Stepping on the gas, I switched the low to high beams, and they did not get off the road. As we came upon them, one [and then apparently the other] just zoomed [did not walk] off to the left, across the ditch, and as I switched to the low beam I had one dead center with the right front headlight. \"We both kept saying, 'My God what is it?' A huge head, no hair, no ears, huge eyes set in deep hollows, wrinkles or folds, but no protruding nose, a small slit for a mouth.\" When interviewed, the witness said, \"They looked so odd, almost a luminous grey. I could not see clothes. They had arms; I didn't notice the fingers. The arms were in proportion to the rest of the body. He had a huge head at least 18 to 20 inches across, with huge eyes 2 1/2 to 3 inches.

After about 8 to 10 minutes, I decided to put the car in gear and cramp the wheels to the left and see if the movement would alert 'it' into moving. \"This was to no avail. All I could think of was hopefully another car would come from either direction. No luck. At this point I told my friend we should very slowly move ahead and try to clear it. \"She said, 'Yes, lets get out of here!' We managed to bypass it, but in doing so, it naturally stood closer to her side of the car, and when it got alongside of the right lower windshield, she couldn't stand it. She yelled and quickly moved almost on top of me. \"When I was sure we had it cleared, I took off fast, and being so upset, I took a wrong turn down the old road in total darkness. I knew immediately the mistake, as we could see the cars going by on the main highway. \"In haste I ground a few gears to find reverse and got to the stop sign by the highway. Now a car had approached the stop, coming from the same area we had left, and took off (to their right). \"We looked at them carefully, hop- ing it was some of our friends from the shower. But they were not, and there are no other known Minnesota reports for that night.\" The two women continued on their way home, discussing the encounter \"fu- riously.\" They could not come up with an answer as to what this being was, but decided it was not a human, not an ani- mal, not a trick or masked being. They thought of the possibility of \"an outer space being,\" but agreed they didn't know anything about them and had doubted their existence. Ruth was very happy to see her home, saying, \"I'll talk to you at work,\" and hurriedly en- tering the house. Liz found out later that Ruth's husband ridiculed her story. Liz also was most anxious to get home, and scrambled fearfully into the house. There she found that after a long hot day of painting, her husband had showered and gone to bed. She writes, \"My niece had dropped in to visit and needed a ride home (ap- proximately 3 miles).

Bressett my husband to get up and go with me, so I agreed to take her. \"I couldn't think of anything except this horrible experience, and related the whole thing to Jean [her niece], and in turn she was almost afraid to get out of the car and go to her apartment. \"When I came home to a quiet house and prepared for bed, I fell apart. I cried and begged my husband to wake up and listen to me. I had to tell him, and it couldn't wait till tomorrow as he re- quested. \"He did listen, but could offer no comforting solution as to what we had seen. He did say Why didn't you hit it and throw it in the trunk and it could have been analyzed?' She told her children die next day about the encounter. Also, she and Ruth both told the office crew, who suggested they report it to the authorities. They, however, did not. They had a fear of reporting it more widely and possibly being laughed at or considered mentally ill. Liz writes, \"It was the most terrify- ing experience either one of us had gone through.\" When on occasion .she meets her co-witness, they mention the event, but do not discuss it. Her co-witness does not want to drink about the event and refused my request for an interview. She did not rule this out completely for some time in the future, however. The dash lights, which had gone off when they stopped for the creature, re- mained inoperative. Liz' husband is a mechanic, but he couldn't make the dash lights work again. They took it to another mechanic's MUFON UFO JOURNAL garage (Johnson's Auto Electric), and they couldn't fix the lights either. Why only the dash lights failed, and none of the rest of the electrical sys- tem, is an interesting question. No craft which might have contained mecha- nisms to cause the dash light failure was observed. The fact of the irreparable dash lights adds to the women's credibility. The detail of the creatures \"floating,\" \"zig- zagging,\" and \"zooming\" rather than walking or running, while seeming fan- tastic to persons unfamiliar with ac- counts of ETs, is a fairly common oc- currence in accounts of the beings as- sociated with UFOs. This investigator can construct no null hypotheses that can account for the facts, other than that of simultaneous hallucinations and coincidental failure of the dash lights. The probability of this is obviously infinitesimal. The prime witness, although she had gone semi-public at the time of the event, understandably does not want any additional publicity at this time. She is in her 70s and experiencing medical problems. Both women were—and are—married and had responsible jobs. They reported their experience in spite of perceived risks to their reputations to coworkers and relatives. The prime witness must be rated high in credibility and in accu- racy of recollection. The beings she reported seeing must be considered to be definitely unidenti- fied. This experience was the apparent beginning of a wave of UFO reports that continued for the rest of 1979. 15"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"Louisiana case...

The light con- tinued to ascend into the morning sky, appearing to get bigger as it came our way. It took at least 15 minutes to move from the 20-degree elevation to a point directly overhead Now overhead, it remained motion- less and soundless, but seemed to wobble slightly at times. There were no discernable appendages. Mr. Faulkner said he thought it might have been a weather balloon that had been launched from Alvin Calendar Air Force Base some 30 miles to the north. Mr. Vasquez offered that it was \"very strange looking.\" Mr. Faulkner's son said it could have been \"one of those UFO things.\" I reserved judgment. After about 30 minutes observing the \"ball of light\" Mr. Vasquez and I de- cided to launch the boat. As the sun rose, I noticed that the object started to reflect light off its surface, which ap- peared metallic. At that point, I told Mr. Vasquez to stop the boat so I could get a better view. The object now looked like the barrage balloons that were used in World War II. Light still reflected off its surface. It then split into two of the barrage bal- loon shapes.

On the last call, he asked if I could come into his office on Monday morning, to which I agreed. The major was courteous and again took another statement.

Although originally published else- where, I commend the journal for re- printing the excellent two-part piece by Deardorff, Haisch, Maccabee, and Puthoff. They have cogently summa- rized a rationale for serious mainstream study of the UFO phenomenon. All members of MUFON should share it with their scientific and aca- demic colleagues cowered by the fear of peer censure or public ridicule. Re- spected as professionals in their own disciplines, their case should cause any- one interested in the search for truth to stand up and take notice. Given their courage to take such a stand, I wonder why they, too, felt it necessary to make two statements that are inconsistent with their own logic. One is \"...the fact that not...in past millennia, have we been colonized, con- quered, or exterminated, nor has soci- ety been traumatized by any ETs...\" To make such a declaration of \"fact\" goes against literally thousands of wit- ness reports and artifacts to the effect that beings more advanced than humans have intervened in human society, be- ginning from at least the end of the Pa- leolithic Era up till, and perhaps beyond, the fall of the Roman Republic. Accounts as detailed and as credible as those quoted in their article can be found in Hebrew, Sumerian, Vedic, Egyptian, and other texts, as well as in the oral traditions on every continent. Second, they write \"...it appears all too evident that ETs have not inter- vened in world affairs in any benevo- lent manner that would have forestalled human warfare, famine, and disease.\" Once again, such a declaration of \"evidence\" is contravened by the sto- ries and drawings of credible witnesses (they had no reason to make up their stories, and nothing to gain by showing their inferiority to more advanced be- ings). The most well-known to most West- erners is the account of Noah's receipt of foreknowledge of the coming Flood and blueprints to build a craft. After the cataclysm, the biblical account of tech- MUFON UFO Journal nical assistance to the human survivors contravenes the authors' assertion. Many analyses have been written on this topic, including my own Gods, Genes, <&° Consciousness. To ignore them is to commit errors of logic and reveal a se- lective scientific perspective, the same fault the article seeks to correct in oth- ers.

Fowler, 2005, BookSurge, LLC, www.booksurge.com,866-308-6235, orders@booksurge.com, 8 1/2 x 11, soft cover, 142 pages, $17.99. This book is primarily about *?\" -5L the 1967 shut- down of 20 Minutemen missiles at Malmstrom Air Force Base near Great Falls, MT, by hovering UFOs. One of the authors, Salas, was a missile launch officer at Malmstrom when the event occurred, thus providing a firsthand view of the incident. The other author, Klotz, has used his expertise in gathering FOIA (Freedom of Information Act) docu- ments to back up and expand Salas' personal experience and research. Salas is a graduate of the Air Force Academy, served on active duty for seven years, and holds a Masters degree in aerospace engineering from the Air Force Institute of Technoogy. He also has a Masters degree in education from the University of Washington. In addition, he worked briefly as an engineer for Martin-Marietta Aerospace and Rockwell International before serv- ing 22 years in the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) until his retire- ment in 1995. Klotz has had an interest in UFOs since 1957, and with partner Dale Goudie founded the Computer UFO Network (CUFON). Klotz has filed more than 1,000 FOIA requests. Thus both authors have excellent backgrounds for dealing with the mis- sile incident at Malmstrom. In addition, veteran UFO investiga- tor Raymond Fowler, who was con- MAY 2005 nected with the Minuteman missiles through his work with Sylvania, provides significant correlating evidence in the Foreward. Sylvania was under contract to de- velop and build the Ground Electrical System for command and control of the Minuteman II Intercontinental Ballistic Missile. At the time of the incident, Fowler, was thus directly connected to the Stra- tegic Air Command Bases (SAC) where Minuteman II was deployed, with ac- cess to individuals who informed him of the UFO incident at Malmstrom. Some of these key individuals said that lab testing indicated that electro- magnetic effects from the UFOs had af- fected strategic electrical equipment. Utilizing hard evidence, this book shows that UFOs did, in fact, shut down up to 20 Minuteman missiles at Malmstrom, and thus do qualify as a military/security threat, despite govern- ment statements to the contrary. In addition to a detailed account of the Malmstrom shutdown, other inci- dents related to UFO encounters with missiles are also recounted. Among these is what could have been a world-wide disaster involving what appears to have been the activation of Soviet missiles by a UFO. For a very tense period of time for the Soviets, the unintended activation seemed to be leading to a launch of those missiles toward the U.S. Fortu- nately, the programmed launch was ter- minated, apparently by the UFO. The first half of the book is devoted to detailing the missile shutdown, related incidents, and discussion of the govern- ment coverup, while the second half is composed of appendexes detailing the Minuteman missile system, acronyms, and FOIA documents. There is exten- sive footnoting, but no index. Those looking for excellent evidence of the reality of UFOs and their poten- tial military threat, as well as equally clear evidence of government coverup, will find it in this book.

AZ 85385-6507, www.refarrellbooks.com, 51/2x81/2 softcover, 263 pages, $13.95. This book, though fictional, has been well researched by the author. In addi- tion to telling a good story, Farrell is in- terested in making readers aware of the UFO phe- nomenon. He and wife Linda, along with daughter Wendy (who is serving as PR person for the book), are travel- ing from city to city in a large motor home, promoting the book and a planned sequel. Noted UFO researcher Stan Friedman says of the book: \"I don't usually enjoy works of fiction dealing with UFOs, but Alienljog is very much the exception. Lots of solid info and an interesting story. I can't wait for the next volume. Robert Farrell has done his homework.\" The story revolves around three indi- viduals, Dr. Wendy Ahearn, a world- renowed linguist; Dr. Corey Newton, a leading expert on quantum gravity; and Col. Pete Mitchell, who directs their above top secret project involving a crashed sau- cer and entities. The three main characters are well de- veloped, and the plot keeps the reader turning pages. As noted, a \"sequel\" is planned, and this is needed, since the book just stops, rather than concluding. The flow does drag a bit during a lengthy discussion of \"the Big Bang\" theory, and explanations of the UFO phe- nomenon may bore the already informed. Some readers may be turned off by the discussion of ET motives.

Most of the craft seemed buried into the cliff, but vents, like a fish gill, were on the back.

Friedman More MJ-12 questions New questions have been raised about the MJ-12 documents from an unexpected source, namely Paul Kimball, a lawyer who started and op- erates Redstar Films in Halifax, Nova Scotia, and who has made three UFO documentaries. The first was \"Stanton T. Friedman is Real,\" which 'was broadcast in 2002 on the Canadian Space Channel. It was a 48-minute biographical documentary filmed in Roswell; at the Irvine, CA, MUFON Symposium; in Cedar Rapids, IA; in my office in Fredericton, New Brunswick, etc. There were critics in- cluded, as well as friends. The second was \"Do You Believe in Majic?\" This was primarily a point- counterpoint between myself and Karl Pflock, with others commenting as well about the MJ-12 documents. It ended with Paul—who was the di- rector, producer, and narrator-indicat- ing that, on balance of probabilities, the MJ-12 documents were probably genu- ine. This also ran 48 minutes, and was broadcast on Canadian TV in 2004. Both are available from UFORI, POB 958, Houlton, ME 04730-0958 (|15 each). The third was \"Aztec,\" which seemed to conclude that there was probably a saucer crash near Aztec, NM, in 1948, based on the outstanding research ef- fort made by Scott Ramsey. Paul is also working on a documen- tary on cattle mutilations, leaning heavily on the work of Canadian researcher Fern Belzil. However, Paul has now changed his tune about both MJ-12 and Aztec. He intends to re-edit DYBIM, reflecting his new conclusion that the documents probably aren't genuine. His first claim is based on the notion that since Vannevar Bush and President Truman were not on very good terms in the post-war period, Truman would not have appointed Bush, despite his outstanding background as a scientist engineer during WW 2 with the Office of Scientific Research and Develop- ment, to such a position. According to the Truman-Forrestal memo of Sept. 24, 1947, Truman au- thorized Forrestal (not Bush) to proceed with Operation Majestic 12, but did say, \"It continues to be my feel- ing that any fu- ture consider- ations relative to the ultimate disposition of this matter should rest solely with the Office of the President fol- lowing appro- priate discus- „ _, . . sions . with StanYmdman yourself) Dr . Bush, and the Director of Central .In- telligence.\" Paul takes care of Wilbert Smith's, Nov. 21, 1950, comment about flying saucers (\"Their Modus Operandi is un- known, but concentrated effort is be- ing made by a small group headed by Dr. Vannevar Bush\") by claiming that Dr. Robert Sarbacher, source of Smith's info in a classified discussion arranged by Canada's military attache, intention- ally misled Smith with the expectation that the information, though classified, would eventually, by some mysterious means, make its way up the Canadian security chain and be passed on to the Russians to convince them that the US had access to alien technology. No evidence has been presented that this happened or was the intention of Sarbacher. Furthermore, he attempts to discredit Smith with character assassi- nation and bringing damning comments made by Dr. Omond Solandt in letters to various UFO researchers in the 1980s long after Smith's death. . Solandt was sort of the Canadian Vannevar Bush, guiding the efforts of the Defense Research Board. On Sept. 24, 1947, Bush had been named head of the US Research and Development Board, a successor to the Joint Research and Development Board, which had succeeded the OSRD. This was the date of the infamous Truman-Forrestal memo establishing MJ-12, and the only date in a period of several months when Bush, Truman, and Secretary Forrestal were all together at the White House. Obviously Truman did NOT appoint Bush to head MJ-12. Truman said to Forrestal, \"You are hereby autho- rized....\" Furthermore, in Bush's notes on the meetingwe find this statement: \".. .cer- tainly in the new post, I would be rather frequently in contact and that if there was an impression [in the scientific com- munity] that I did not have his confi- dence he felt that that impression would soon be corrected by future relations.\" If Truman had no faith in Bush, why would he have named him head of the R & DB? His MJ-12 activities would be in total secrecy and not a matter for public debate. In a TOP SECRET memo of 16 December, 1947, Forrestal's special as- sistant, John Ohly, sent a memo to Bush noting that he had been appointed by The War Council as chairman of a spe- cial committee to deal with \"Prepara- tions against a sneak attack,\" and loads of resources were available to him. (No indication of whether this attack would be from Russia or aliens or...) General Hoyt Vandenberg, also an MJ-12 member and USAF Chief of Staff, was a member of this committee. TOP SECRET minutes of a later War Council meeting note that all mem- bers had received a copy of a TOP SE- CRET item from Bush, and should be prepared to discuss it. There is no clue as to what it was about. This committee and MJ-12 were not public groups wherein political consid- erations might have been very impor- tant, but were highly classified Black Budget groups. It seems to me that 20 MUFON UFO Journal May 2005"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"Bush's advice and knowledge would have been sought because of his long history of massive contribution to the military effort via his earlier chairman- ship of the NACA, and his heading of theOSRDandJRDB. Nobody was more knowledgeable concerning who had what capabilities at which installation for top-notch, highly-classified research—such as trying to determine Modus Operandi of fly- ing saucers. Truman certainly had strong views about how research grants might be dis- tributed, etc, and zealously guarded con- trol. Bush had been allowed much lee- way by Roosevelt. A book strongly contributing to Paul's feelings about Bush vs. Truman is G. Pascal Zachary's Endless Frontier: I'annevar Bush, Engineer of the American Century (The Free Press, 1997). I note with dismay that Vandenberg and War Council are not even listed in the index. I had a conversation with Zachary, a Wall Street Journal reporter, years ago, and at that time felt he was not very fa- miliar with Bush's classified activities. Solandt admitted that he and Bush had indeed discussed UFOs, but wea- sel-worded just what was said and why, and implied that he knew of no big se- cret US effort-though if it was account- able to the President, he probably wouldn't know about it. None of his letters were sent to people with a need to know, in contrast to. the Sarbacher-Smith exchange. I had located Sarbacher many years ago because of a memo from Canadian Arthur Bray. I met with him on his yacht in Palm Beach, and also met later with Solandt in Ontario. My own feeling was that Sarbacher was being very straightforward about a small event in a very busy life. I felt that Solandt was being very care- ful in the manner I have found com- mon with people who have classified information they cannot divulge to oth- ers not having a clearance and need to know—trying to avoid direct lying, but not giving out much information either. Solandt could denigrate Smith when nobody was around to defend him. But when Smith was awarded posthumously the Canadian Engineering Award (not awarded every year), the citation noted \"...the Award was made in recognition of a lifetime of dedicated and distin- MAY 2005 guished service to the advancement of technical knowledge in the Canadian broadcasting industry, the improvement of its techniques, the protection of its interests, of an example of diligence and integrity and in consideration of the universal respect and regard that Wilbert's efforts had earned throughout the broadcasting industry, in the gov- ernment of Canada, and in other areas.\" I think all of us would greatly appre- ciate such praise from our professional colleagues. Yes, Wilbert had many in- terests, some of which might displease some people. So what? Kimball also raised two other points: Why was Forrestal not replaced on Majestic 12 until 01 August, 1950, even though he left office as Secretary of De- fense in January of 1949 and died on May 22,1949? Was it MJ-11 for awhile? Obviously, I am not psychic. How- ever, let us notice that the Eisenhower Briefing Document (EBD) states that Forrestal's \"death created a vacancy which remained unfilled until 01 August, 1950, upon which date Gen. Walter B. Smith was designated as permanent re- placement.\" We have no way of knowing whether he may have been a temporary mem- ber, and then was made permanent when Truman named him the new Di- rector of Central Intelligence. The first three DCIs were already MJ-12 mem- bers. Finally, Paul asked why I had not in- vestigated the crash noted on page 5 of the EBD on 06 December, 1950, in the El Indio-Guerrero area of the Texas- Mexican border. The reasons are simple: I live a long way from there and had nothing to work with, neither names of people nor a specific location. The EBD says \"what remained of the object had been almost totally incinerated. Such material as could be recovered was transported to the A.E.G. facility at Sandia, New Mexico.\" I have been to Sandia. The chance of getting any information from this high security nuclear weapons lab would be nil. Furthermore, I was well aware that some investigation was being done by two Texans, Dennis Stacey and Tom Deuley, of MUFON. ' They had some leads which didn't pan out. I do know that there had been MUFON UFO JOURNAL a National Red alert called on that date because of something flying towards the Southwest as noted by Dr. Bruce Maccabee in his book about The FBI and UFOs. I had my hands and budget full with my Roswell Investigation, where there was a lot to work with. In short then, I can find no reason in the face of these challenges to change my mind about MJ-12, the documents, or the group. Real as described! Stan Friedman, fsphys@rogers.com, www.stantonfriedman.com. Louisiana case... (Continued from Page 16) pleted the form as requested with rough drawings, and asked the major what was his opinion on the sighting. Without answering, he excused him- self and came back with a clipped, un- dated newspaper article from the Times Picayune newspaper. Basically the article said that an aircraft had gone down in the vicinity of my sighting. Of course I told him that this ball of light rose from the marsh and ascended above us and didn't go down. He of- fered no explanation or opinion. Feeling that my intelligence had been insulted, I left his office more perplexed than ever, and decided to check out his story. My first contact was with Navy Chief Maurice Gerhardt (now deceased) stationed at Alvin Calendar Field in Plaquemines Parish. Chief Gerhardt was a meteorologist at the base and a neighbor of mine. I asked if an aircraft had gone down in the marsh on the day of my sighting, and whether any weather balloons were launched within my sighting time frame. After a day or two he got back with me and reported negative on both ques- tions. Subsequently, I went to the Jefferson Parish Library and went through every issue of the previous week's newspa- pers, searching for the article the major had shown me. There was no such ar- ticle. Obviously, someone was trying to discredit my sighting by disinformation. I stand by every word I've reported, and have no reason to fabricate such a story. I believe if the major followed pro- tocol, that signed form I completed in 1959 might still be found, perhaps somewhere in the National Archives. 21"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"Director's Message (Continued from Page 2) They were credited with producing a weekly documentary TV program called \"UFO Reality,\" which received huge public interest.
