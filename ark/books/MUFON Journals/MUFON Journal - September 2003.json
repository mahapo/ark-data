These reports appeared on slices of lime- stone, utilizing red and black ink. These limestone writing bases are called ostraca. App ro x i - mately 1203 BC, on the 29th of July, at the capi- tal city of Uast McBride (Thebes) an ob- ject appeared concurrent with the annual \"coming forth of the star Sept (Sirius). The arrival of the star Sept marked the New Year season of Shemut and the in- undation of the Nile. Due to the Nile flood- ing, all work stopped, and a 20-day holi- day was observed as the festival of Apt of Amon Ra. Approximately 600,000 Egyptians would participate. As the gilded boats of pharaoh and the god Amon Ra passed down the river from Karnak to Luxor, the crowds cheered, enjoying the pomp, free food, and beer courtesy of Amon Ra. Suddenly an intense bright object was spotted low in the night sky. Thousands witnessed it. Named S-hakk the Demon, the anomaly with two piercing lights moved about, reached out and carried off people, cut tongues, left and returned, and silenced mouths, according to the reports. There was a possibility that it traveled four hundred miles to northern cities dur- ing its journey. The first report (Ostraca I) by a young scribe and a temple servant showed puzzlement and fear. The second report (Ostraca II—thirty-five statements) by a group of scribes and priests of affiliated temples of Horus/Osiris left no doubt as to its purpose; they called it evil and wanted it gone. Egyptologists who categorized it as \"magic\" have largely ignored this event. The Griffith Institute, Ashmolean Mu- seum in Oxford, England, has accepted September 2003 7OURWEY OF THE OEMOM MUFON UFO Journal Page 3"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"my paper, \"Journey of a Demon,\" as I used some ostraca belonging to the mu- seum in my paper. As an independent researcher, I con- sider these two examples of this ancient writing to be unique in their recording of a most unusual event. Every means has been pursued to correctly time frame this occurrence. It did, please note, happen 3,200 years ago—not fifty. By the compilation of all relative events, one can come quite close in dat- ing the phenomenon, however, and there- fore I choose 1203 BC as the target year, based on available information relative to the scribes, one of whom is linked to the reign of Seti II, and the other to Ramessus HI a short time later. These two records of an astral hap- pening approximately 1203 BC have been seemingly ignored, as they were cata- logued under \"Magical\" in the index of Hieratic Ostraca Volume I, the source book for this report, and considered a pro- jection of a sky-based religion. They depict through the eyes of sev- eral individuals-who lacked technology of any sort-what was considered a physi- cal manifestation of a god/demon in the heavens on a rampage-^the form of hu- man, animal or anthropomorphic being the only consideration applicable to what was witnessed at the time. This was reinforced by, but not lim- ited to, their religion. Scenario, Ostraca I South in the land of Kam-T, City of Uast, the rumors had been surfacing for two days. Whispers from cracked lips, an uneasiness in the scorching winds. Fi- nally on the evening of the ascent of the star Sept, heralding in Shemut the sea- son of inundation, it happened. Scribe Kaii, a student at the House of Life, Temple of Horus Son of Isis, saw it. Almost at the same time temple servant Set did too: two intense piercing lights hanging motionless in the clear night sky. The two young men climbed to the roof to get a better look, but not before Kaii grabbed his scribe kit, and Set an oil lamp. Filling the thirsty ink cakes, drawing forth two papyrus pens while Set lit the lamp, the scribe began to document on a small piece of limestone (ostraca) all that was before him. Set was trembling'\"in fear, his arms raised in fright as if to blanket away the glare from the heavens (see drawing above right). Kaii recorded this in red ink. Switching pens, he wrote skillfully with his left hand all that he knew and what he saw of what the people were calling S-hakk, new usurper of the ordered heav- ens, the \"Super Disrupter\" or \"Destroyer\" as his name implied. Like two glowering eyes, the lights were like no other; hovering unmoving and menacingly low just above the hori- zon. One could.feel its presence, its hot stare like a lion in wait. For half an hour the unknown entity sat, then unhurriedly began to move away into the distance. The following morning, Kaii took the information he recorded to the temple priests, who hastily convened a service at the rear of the temple, near the sy- camores. They placed incense, symbolic arrows, and weaponry on the linen-covered table of offerings, the meaning of which was totally lost to the scribe. By mid-morn- ing, people of the city began to arrive, the other witnesses to that event in the heavens with their \"Ta\" cakes as offer- ings in hopes to placate the demon S-hakk. Scenario Ostraca II Thirty years later and 60 miles to the south of Uast, in the Hespt of Thes Hertu and east of the city called Teb, lay the temple of Horus of Behutet-the place known for centuries as Netchem' Tchem Ankh (PleasantLife). In the hidden chamber known as Mesnet, just behind the sanctuary, a stone carver turned novice scribe by the name of Behent found something new to copy. Deep at the bottom of a large-necked jar lay a piece of limestone with writing. Wiping the dust from its neglected sur- face, he slowly began to duplicate the message onto another stone in intricate hieratic script all that had been recorded so carefully thirty years earlier: a demon in the heavens above the holy cities of Annu and Uast, the two centers 400 miles apart. There were other cities mentioned.... Things cited it had done...what did it mean, this thing of evil? And why was this piece of limestone so well hidden? Ostraca I (recto): Line by Line Interpretation 1. Hail to thee S-hakk coming forth from Sept. Initially greeted with awe as a god. The name S-hakk implies: to destroy; to pierce; a being having the personification of tor- ment; the embodiment of evil. Coming forth from Set is a clever way of saying appearing at or near the helical ascent of Set, or Sirius, in the heavens (approxi- mately 29 July). 2. With his front he seeist. The entity has an eye or eyes at front end. Since the sighting was at night, the eyes would be lights. The word ar-t (to see) is a restoration. 3. With his jaw (singular) he eats Ta cakes from the west. In Kam-t, human jaw was depicted as being in two pieces. An appendage, ex- tending below front of entity, described as a tongue in Ostraca II, was responsible for the acquisition of Ta cakes. Ta cakes signified round flattened bread or cake, at times oval in form, and were the ob- jects perceived at a distance being drawn up into the \"mouth\" of the demon. Cakes denotes multiple objects. In actuality what was taken would have been larger, Page 4 MUFON UFO Journal September 2003"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"of course. From the west almost specifies other aerial objects. 4. By stretching out he gives the evil eye. The nighttime view of the very bright lights (see Ostraca II regarding eyes, sin- gular or plural) would, coupled with the fear of the unknown, qualify as evil eye. Stretching out seems to indicate a light beam, but could simply mean brightness. 5. They are doomed, the star gods. Compared with S-hakk and his over- whelming appearance, the other estab- lished stars seem dwarfed. This also im- plies a presence. 6. See him live with his front (broken) Lit: How can one deny his presence, his reality? 7. (broken) mysteries in the southern sky Note plural mysteries. Can the Ta cakes be something else? Southern sky signi- fies Kam-t of the south; northern sky, Kam-t of the north. He is fear. Exactly as it says. 8. (broken) (the) moun- tains, the roaming lions meet (but) like, who? What? ' Trying to equate the demon with feral behavior. Lit: (As in the) mountains, the roaming lions gather (but) like, what who? (is this?). Note equating demon with lion, as in Ostraca II. 9. (broken) not the soul Shata, the name of. Ba Shata translates genuine or plau- sible soul. The name of. , a refer- ence to some religious entity or explana- tion. To sum up: He is not the soul Shata. 10. (broken) so and so. This was double-checked in both Ger- man, and English. Clearly the scribe was running out of candidates to identify. S-hakk with. So and so, of course, means unnamed and unspecified-unknown. 11. (broken) Thou art leaving. Signifies movement and travelling. Ostraca I. (verso) Line by Line Interpretation 1. (The people gave) on account of me.. I, they gave, behind the sanctuary, words.... Partially broken message. A meeting between scribe Kaii and what appears to be witnesses to the \"demon.\" The .wit- nesses gave an account of their observa- tions. The meeting would have been with the people as well as the priests because it occurred behind the sanctuary. 2. (placed) upon the linen for flowers (offerings). It was done with spears An obvious offering to S-hakk, or cer- emony pertaining to said demon.. \"Done with spears\" also meant, \"done with ar- mor.\" Either a ceremony or armed pres- ence at the ceremony. 3. (against/by?) the people. He was give Ta cakes from The word er means either by or against. Coupled with the previous statement it either means: (A) Ceremony done with spears against the people, or (B) Cer- emony done with spears by the people. \"He was given Ta cakes from \" refers to S-hakk. A reenactment of S-hakk eat- ing Ta cakes. I tend to think (B) is correct meaning. Ostraca II Line by Line Interpretation 1. Get thee back S-hakk coming forth in the sky! Hardly a greeting as in Ostraca I. This shows awareness of demon's deportment. \"Get out of here!\" would be a current equivalent. \"Coming forth in the sky\" shows this is not scribe Kaii in Ostraca 1, as he said \"coming forth from Sept.\" 2. He seeist with his front. The use of tebt, a physical applica- tion, signifies the furthest extension of the face; nose, eye area, but not, how- ever, the brow to any degree. The two scribes (Ostraca I and Ostraca 11) used this tebt in the same sense-the frontal area with eyes. The use of two eyes is rare. Most depictions of \"eyes of the Gods\" of Kam-t were singular; witness eye of Horus, eye of Ra as singular units. The anomaly must have had two points of il- lumination, or more. 3. His two legs are at tail end. As kepesh (animal hind leg) signifies power, ret-f (his legs) also signifies pro- pulsion at rear, perceived in a horizontal position. .Face with eyes (lights); rear with legs (power). A horizontal configuration is proven with following statement #4. (The word art is misspelled). 4. He eats Ta cakes from under him. Only by being perceived as lying prone can .the entity \"eat Ta cakes\" be- low him. In order to \"eat\" he would have to have a tongue. In order to \"zap\" the Ta cakes up (ref. item #25) in the fashion of a lizard, the \"food source\" had to travel from the ground or air to the bottom of the demon to be \"eaten\" (ref. Ostraca I, eat- ing Ta cakes from the west.) Passing in front of stars does not count-the scribes were not ignorant. 5. His power (kepesh, i.e. animal leg, propulsion) of the west is in his travel- ling. This statement and following estab- lish a west to east movement. His eastern power is in .his reaching out (extending authority ).. Contrast this with eating Ta cakes from the west, i.e., east to west movement. 6. His eastern power is in his reach- ing out (extending authority) Contrast this with Ostraca I, item #2, eating Ta cakes from the west, i.e., east to west movement. 7. He is fear to the gods of Neterkhert Neterkhert would be the home of the gods equated to heaven. Literally he was a definite threat to all established religions ofKam-t. .  ... 8. To snare (or net) is thy power. People or animals were taken, 9. When thou leaves thou returns. . Proof entity, moved around \"sky, was witnessed subsequent times. . 10. Thou snatches or grabs ears. Another way of saying capturing, tak- ing. •  •  .  ..•••••. 11. Thou sealest mouths. To cause victims to go into shock? Perhaps abject fear, or inability to discuss incident. 12. Thou cut tongues. Exactly what it says-specifically what was done with the \"victims\" or the rea- son for these actions has disturbing im- plications. 13. A Holy Father of the temple, a holy one among those of Annu. This statement is curious. It is obvi- ous that S-hakk was considered as dan- gerous and unwanted and shows that multiple sources were passed on as input to temple Horus of Behutet. This could also be a slap at gods Re and Amon-Re of Annu and Uast as declaring, \"This is your demon not ours;\" or \"you caused this.\" September 2003 MUFON UFO Journal Page 5"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"14. Thou shalt not fall from thy ex- alted hand. Lit: Like it or not, you are an uncon- trollable force and presence. We do not know what to do with you, and you cer- tainly seem to do what you want, so we will have to learn to live with you if you stay. 15. Born at night, in daytime often (or all hours) First appeared at night, but observed at various times of the day. The descrip- tion of daytime can be interpreted sev- eral ways; suffice to say it was observed during daytime at different hours. 16. It was he in god form of (a) son of Isis (sa ast). A reference to Ostraca I, \"coming forth from Sept; making an appearance on heli- cal ascent of Sept, which is identified with goddess Isis. This equated to \"being born\" of Isis. Helical ascent of Sept was approximately 29 July. 17. A blood relation of Asar Unnefer (Osiris Unnefer) Continuation of item #16. Another ex- ample attempting to affix a religious cor- relation to the demon. This blood rela- tion of Osiris, which refers back to item #16, son of Isis could also be construed as the evildoer Set, brother of Osiris. Personally I feel this is nothing more than offering up a series of possible ex- planations to an enigma; another example of multiple input. I fail to see how the priests of Osiris/Horus/Isis would have been willing to embrace this presence, except, of course 'as identifying it with Set, the negative force-something, how- ever, they did not specifically do. 18. Repeating \"Hail to thee\" bring him back. Another reference of secondary sightings. 19. Thou showest thyself as the (lion type fierce-eyed god) Hesa son of Bast. Hesa equals Ari-Hes. Ari-Hes was known as having a fierce penetrating evil eye (note Ostraca I reference to evil eye). This reference, however, is coupled with the following item, and pertains to Ari-Hes having other attributes. 20. With his wrecking overturning, casting out with thy body (!?). Again an action not quite known. The most likely answer is a disturbance in appearance, shape shifting, or radical color shift. A blurring could account also for such a description, much as a car ap- proaching in the distance on a road on a very hot day under certain conditions appears to shape/shift hi a mirage fash- ion; optical phenomena. Refer this theory to item #21: the following (note: the abil- ity of a lion to camouflage its appearance may be a partial key of Ari-Hes.) 21. Thou changes thy skin.... (!?) Again this strange action. Another attribute to possible shape/shifting. This would tend to be noticeable during day- time. Before these Lords of Annu. A daytime appearance in front of key witnesses of authority. 22. Thou cuts, cause destruction in coming forth in the sky. Damage attributed to the demon. The cutting refers to physical damage, not an astral maneuver. 23. Thine eyes! Behold thee (with) thy front! The use of plural eyes, as mentioned before, is rare. The perception of a \"face like front\" with two eyes (lights) held obvious fascination to the observers. The use of plural lights places the demon in a distinct category and negates the possi- bility of stars, planets, and the like being mistaken for the entity. The accent is on brightness. 24. The tongue of thee (allows one to grasp) who thou art. 25. Thou eats Ta cakes from under thy body. \"Eating Ta cakes\" again. The tongue, or one-half human jaw bone (see Ostraca I, item #3), this \"tongue\" is some means of lifting objects from the ground to the demon and may be visible, semi-visible, or simply perceived. A light beam would fit nicely. Again, the only way for the scribes to justify what was happening was to think of the entity in human, animal, or anthropomorphic form. Two references of eating Ta cakes (with a tongue) are in Ostraca II; one reference of the same food procurement is in Ostraca I with tongue or \"jaw bone\" as sole means of attainment. Note that Ta cakes are lo- cated below entity. 26. Hesmimi the name of thy mother. Unable to match name Hesmimi on record. The name implies fierce-eyed li- oness or feline. There is no deity symbol used. What is apparent is that this is yet another opinion of S-hakk's origin. 27. Rebel the name of thy father. The name rebel at that time had a much more severe connotation than current usage. \"Hell raiser\" would be more ap- propriate. 28. When thou appears before man in the west, east, north, and south (of the sky) the gods Unfortunately the remainder is broken. It demonstrates the ability of the demon to appear at random, in multiple places and cardinal points; and again concern about the gods. 29. (broken) thy power in the west This could be tied to the following item. 30. \"Reaching out to carry off who thou art Another reference to abduction. 31. \"Departer\" thy name by (the abil- ity of) expelling thy body. Another reference to physical action, fleeing the area; the word used for expel, tr, also means to drive out or destroy, but outside of becoming invisible (destroy), the correct usage should be \"expelling\" (thy body) from the vicinity. Still, the idea of destroying its presence is intribuing, as its very name S-hakk (destruction in- ternalized) signifies one of its salient fea- tures. 32. (broken) (poss) thy soul.... (poss) thy soul...To give thee a name of evil. Enough said. Obvious reference to actions of demon. 33. Do not thou travel to (the city of) Tettu. Fear of religious turmoil in this holy city north of Annu upon its appearance. 34. Not (may be seen) thy front to (the cityoQAbtu. Concern also over this appearance four hundred miles to the south in an obvious return trip to area of original sighting. Abtu is north of Uast. The same preoccu- pations and worries about upsetting reli- gious precepts. 35. (Because) you caused flooding at Thairr (Tharr?) In this case I fail to see how this could be. It does, however, raise the possible presence of demon S-hakk over either Tharr north near Tettu and the marshy area of Sma Behiit or to the south near the city of Teb (home of Horus of Behutet), which also has area called Sma Behut, though not marshy.

This month the challenging investigation of this anomaly is recounted by Scarpellini. First trip S aturday morning, June 7, 2003, Bruce Catt, a farmer from Knobel, AR, flew his ultralight aircraft over a wheat field at the intersection of AR Hwy. 90 and Clay County Road 250 and saw a formation of circles that was not there Friday, June 6, when he had flown'over the same field. He immediately informed the man farm- ing the field, Todd Young. Bruce Catt steadfastly maintains that this had to be made by humans, \"Doug & Dave style\" and made fun of it. I personally doubt this theory. The day I was there, there were enough mosquitos to bleed you dry, plus squadrons of other flying insects and assorted creepy-crawlies in abundance. And this was high noon on a'sunny day. At night, bug time, the insect population must be truly awe-inspiring. .1 can't see rope-and-board circle inakers working to make a beautiful formation in such a thinly populated area. They'd want an audi- ence! This was a formation often circles, a central circle approximately 47 feet in di- ameter and three slightly curved \"arms\" consisting of three circles each, the larg- est of the \"arm\" circles being closest to the central circle and measuring approxi- mately 27 feet. The next \"arm\" circle was approxi- mately 17 feet and the last and smallest circle approximately 9 feet in diameter: Each circle in each arm was separated from the others and from the central circle by about 9 feet. The crop (wheat) was laid down flat in a clpckwise direction with no stalks at all left standing. Pictures show that the crop appears to be down in more than one layer, all clockwise. The formation closely re- sembles the famous \"Julia Set\" that was found in England. September 2003 f -* i  At tk  • « TO * iMnt. -JU**' JL V I &.

Fred Martin, saw the formation first- hand, going to the site with Todd Young. He (Martin (stated that the exact cen- ter of the swirls was very easy to see and he had actually pinpointed the center by sticking a pencil into the soil which was bare at that point. He described the \"swirled\" center as looking like the swirl of hair on a hound dog's neck. From what 1 was able to determine a week later, the whole area then became a media circus with an army of local visi- tors, newspaper reporters, radio inter- viewers, and representatives of TV sta- tions from Memphis, TN, Jonesboro, AR, and Kansas City, MO, putting in appear- ances, along with CNN and MSNBC I intended to visit Knobel Thursday, June 12, five days after the formation was found. I didn't go that day because I was informed that the field had already been cut and burned. When I did get there Monday, June 16, the field had been disced over and planted with soybeans. An adjacent field to the north had al- ready been planted with soybeans which had germinated and were about 4 inches high. A field to the east was well grown rice. The field is bordered on the west by CR 250 and on the south by AR Hwy. 90. The formation was described to me as being about 500 feet east and a little south of the Bond Cemetery, which is bordered MUFON UFO Journal on three sides by the field and CR 250 on the west. I walked over a good portion of the field in that general area, having some aerial photos to help locate the spot and using a compass, EM field meter, and su- per magnet, trying to find where the for- mation had been. No success. The field was thoroughly chopped up and stirred and surprisingly dry. I found some areas where very little stubble was visible and, hoping that these were areas where the wheat was fiat to the ground, I tried to locate magnetic par- ticles in those spots. All my efforts were unsuccessful, and I did not find with any certainty where the formation had been. At the Courier office I talked to a newspaper employee, Marylee Vines, a tiny, elderly woman. She had been to the formation Sunday night and walked through only three of the circles in one arm. She didn't go into the central circle or any of the other arms. She repeatedly said it was \"spooky,\" but was unable to describe the cause of this \"spookiness.\" It's possible she was feeling some residual energy, or it may have been simply that a beautiful geo- metric pattern of perfectly flat wheat was so unusual that it spooked her. She found in the largest of the circles she entered a bird's nest, with eggs in it, on the ground on top of the downed Page?"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"wheat. It was slightly off center of the swirl, undamaged and intact. No adult bird was seen, and she didn't know what kind of bird's nest it may have been. It was the common cup-shaped nest seen in trees, which means that it wasn't the nest of a ground-nesting bird. Being on top of the downed wheat makes one think it was deposited there after the wheat went down. She said she didn't pick it up or touch it, saying that she was afraid of getting mites from it, then admitted being afraid that the nest might be \"affected\" in some unknown way that could be detrimental to anyone touching it. (This was while she was al- ready in the middle of an unexplained circle.) I scanned nine photos of the area, some aerial and some at ground level, pro- vided by Fred Martin of the Courier. Sev- eral of them show unusual features, such as fog, mist, and \"black squiggles.\" Another employee of the Courier, a middle-aged woman who did not give her name, asked me if I had heard the legend of the crop circle. I asked her if there had been a previous circle with a legend at- tached and she said no, the legend was about this circle. A legend, full blown, in a week! The story she told is as follows: There was an old man who had lived all his life around Knobel. He had in- sisted all his life that he was an alien and \"knew things.\" Upon his death he would be claimed by, and taken away by, aliens. He was generally considered to be slightly demented, but harmless, and had been a productive citizen. He died the first week of June, 2003, and was buried Friday, June 6,2003, in Bond Cemetery. Included as part of the funeral services was a Masonic ritual. The day was warm and sunny, a beautiful day. When the Masonic ritual was begun the sky clouded over, the wind rose, and there was some lightning and thunder, but no rain. This was within 5 minutes. When the ritual was finished, the sky cleared and the wind died, again in just a few minutes time. This was taken as a sign, but no one seemed to know a sign ofwhat. Then Saturday morning, the next day, the crop formation was found about 400 feet from the cemetery. This was seen as a sure sign that aliens had indeed taken the man away, and left the circles as a marker that they had been there. I talked to several people who knew the man and had attended the funeral. They all gave me basically the same story. The man had claimed to be an alien, and he said they would take him away upon his death. The sudden storm did not occur- that was embellishment. And so a legend is born. The area around Knobel, AR, popula- tion about 350, is rural, sparsely popu- lated farmland. JustNW of Knobel is a large low-lying swampy area and nearby is the Black River. The area grows rice, cotton, com, soy- beans, and wheat. I didn't see much wheat, though. Mostly rice, and soy- beans or cotton. I didn't see any cattle at all. Farming seems to be the only busi- ness around here. There's a lot of irriga- tion-ditch, pump and valve variety. No rolling spray arm type at all, probably be- cause rice doesn't get sprayed-it sits in water. Trip two On June 25 I made a return trip to Knobel for the purpose of picking up negatives from Joe and Doris Sellmeyer and getting soil samples from the area of the crop formation. - The negatives were given to me for scanning, etc., including the entire film strip taken at the funeral of Landis Smith, the man mentioned earlier as the man who said he would be taken away by aliens after his death. Neither of the Sellmeyers collected any wheat from the formation. The pictures taken at ground level of a circle are not the largest, central circle. They are of the largest of the circles in one of the arms of the formation. There are no photos of the largest circle taken from the ground. Joe Sellmeyer said he did not hear or see anything unusual the night the circles were formed, nor did he hear of anyone else seeing anything unusual. However, he did state that two weeks prior (weekend of May 24) at about 10:30 PM he had gone to bed and was looking out a bedroom window. He saw a very bright white light/object go from north to south, watching it for some seconds un- til it went out of sight. It was large (quarter size at arm's length?) and somewhere between round and football shape. It made no sound whatsoever and followed a straight line. He could make no estimate of altitude. The following day a man who works for Sellmeyer said he had seen the same thing. Todd Young walked with me into the ex-wheat field to show me where the for- mation had been. He must have remem- bered very well, because this area yielded a lot of magnetic particles, while none were found in other areas of the field! He had not seen or heard anything unusual, either. He said he cut and burned the field so quickly because 1) it had to be done anyway and 2) the media, neighbors, and strangers were driving him crazy. He did not take any samples of wheat. I believe he was the first person to walk into the formation. The field was quickly planted (June 11 or 12) with soybeans. I was there June 16 and the beans had not yet germinated. The soil was rather dry at that time. When I returned June 25 the beans had germi- nated and were about 2-1/2 inches tall with 3 or 4 leaves. There had been a very light rain 3 or 4 days earlier (about June 21), but not enough to wash away tire tracks or any- thing on the surface. The germination time of the seed in the formation and the rest of the field must have been the same, since the growth was quite uniform over the whole field. Since the soil was quite dry, most of the small bean plants showed slight yel- lowish mottling on the leaves (due to dry conditions), but Mr. Young commented that where we were standing looked greener to him. In fact it was greener. The leaves on those plants had almost no yellowish mottling. We were standing where he said the formation had been. This caused him considerable surprise, and he said he'd watch the field carefully to see if that area looked any different as the crop matured. He was in a hurry to get back'to work and had to cut short our conversation, so I stayed and took soil samples in the area (I had marked the location he indi- cated with a GPS.) I took samples in what I hoped was the area of the largest circle; then, using a photo as a guide, took more samples from what I hoped were the circles in one of the arms-a total of 10 Ib. of soil. There were magnetic particles on or near the surface where I sampled, as noted in the report last month, indicating the circle was not hoaxed. Another 3 Ib. of soil samples taken about 500 feet from the formation as controls showed no magnetic particles.

You need not know how to hypnotize anyone, nor how to counsel therapeuti- cally; you only need some very simple \"tools\" you can share with the CEE. Tools such as a Comparison of CE-IV, ASP, OBE and Negative Entities, a Time Line, Pie Charts, a complete bibliotherapy, advice for journaling, and exercises for discerning memory from fantasy are in- valuable aids for both the investigator and the CEE. As in any other investigation, you must remain open-minded and non-com- mitted about the data you collect. You must record all of it, even if you doubt its reality or truth. The Truth of a report is not your call to make; your business is to make sure you get it all and that you get it ethically. Dan Wright's booklet, \"Interviewing the UFO Witness,\" is unparalleled for advice on how to do the investigative intake, or interview. It tells you how to avoid making value judgments, how to ask non-leading questions, and how to remain objective. Dan writes, \"We are neither cynics nor apologists concerning the reality of alien visitations. The desire on the part of each of us to improve our interviewing meth- ods underscores the search for truth.\" The most important area a CEE needs help in is in telling what is \"real\" for them- selves. You cannot possibly tell them what's \"real,\" although if you are very well versed in CE phenomenon you may be able to tell them that others have expe- rienced similar events. Unfortunately, this information is hard to come by. Optimally, the CEE needs to be able to tell for themselves if their memo- ries are \"real.\" You can help them im- mensely by sharing the Discrimination of Dual Images exercise with them. Discrimination Of dual images Chose a fantasy image, such as a scene from a daydream, and a real memory im- age from your own past that you're sure is your own. Neither of them should be traumatic nor about Close Encounters; \"normal\" life, happy images are best. One at a time, look at each image very closely and see what happens as you (in- wardly) stare at it. Do this to the whole, entire image .... and then focus on just individual aspects or parts of each im- age. Usually, if what is stared at changes as though it doesn't have a set character to begin with it's fantasy. If the thing stared at stays the same during the star- ing, it's memory. The memory image will remind you of many other associations, prodding you to recall other images, but it will not eas- ily melt or transform under your gaze. A well-rehearsed fantasy, such as a visual- ization made from pieces of memory, i.e. a beach scene or a meadow scene used often for relaxing or comforting, will eas- ily alter when you choose to alter an ele- ment, but a real memory will not; try it! Below are a number of other discernable attributes of real memory and of fantasy. Notice each while inspecting your dual images. Go through this dis- crimination of dual images exercise again and again until you're sure of the differ- ences between your memory and your fantasy images. Some Attributes Of Memory NO DECISIONS The sequencing of memory is effort- less, whilst the sequencing of imagina- tion requires making choices and using will. EMOTIONAL DEPTH The emotional content of memory has depth whilst the memory stirred by imagi- nation has little or no emotional content. LOCATION OF SENSATIONS AND EMOTIONS Personal emotions are felt in the body, usually in our stomach or heart. They are swiftly felt, sometimes acutely, and are familiar. Emotions that we feel for others will feel differently; they are thought about before being felt, and their impact won't be as powerful. If you are an empathic person, if you are very psychic or intuitive, especially if you too easily lose your emotional boundaries, you may find this a difficult discernment to make. You'll have to no- tice what the differences are between feel- ing something in your own body and feel- ing someone else's feelings first. CAN'T CHANGE DETAILS In the recall of a memory the details can't easily be altered; they'll become more detailed or they'll bring in associ- ated memories the longer they're concen- trated on. In imagination, details are eas- ily changed, and the more changes that happen, the more you realize that this is made up. SPONTANEOUS SENSE IMPRES- SIONS Memory is often a whole recording, i.e., it has associated sensory parts such as sounds and smells which come with it. There may be spontaneous physical ex- periences involved in memory. For instance, when remembering a first love you may automatically also remem- ber the smell of their leather jacket or the sound of the music you listened to with them. In imagination the sensory details aren't spontaneous, although they'll be produced if suggested. TIMING Memory's REAL TIME review is un- like imagination's faster pace. A simple memory exercise is to recall a childhood pet. Put that memory aside, and imagine another animal in that scene. Switch between the memory and the fan- tasy. Stare at both animals. Touch, smell and listen to them. See which one brings up other sensory memories. Notice how you know one image is the \"real\" memory and the other is fantasy. Past Life therapist Bettye Binder has created wonderful exercises for differen- tiating fantasy from memory. Her Past Life Regression Guidebook is very helpful guidance for self-exploration. You've begun the exploration of your own past. You are now prepared to tell for yourself if something you recall is \"real.\" It's best that you, the investigator, try this exercise for yourself first. It's best to be alone in a quiet spot, but it's not nec- essary. Keep in mind that everyone will have a different set of sensory abilities: most are visually minded, some are more kines- thetic, and a few will have trouble being able to \"see\" anything and will rely on an interior \"knowing.\" All sensory sets are fine and will re- trieve valuable, \"real\" information when the interviewee is able to tell, for them- selves, whether they are recalling fanta- sies or memories. September 2003 MUFON UFO Journal Page 9"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"Ufology Profile Dan Aykroyd explains long-time interest in UFOs Interviewed by Reed Hall Knowing of media celebrity Dan Aykroyd's serious interest in the UFO phenomenon, MUFON International Di- rector John Schuessler and Membership Director Lin Simpson recently contacted Dan, offering him the position of MUFON's \"Hollywood Consultant.\" Dan accepted, and expressed a desire to help MUFON cultivate membership within Hol- lywood. Dan is a life- time MUFON member, and graciously con- sented to the following interview: RH: The general Avkrovd public thinks of Dan Aykroyd primarily as a comedian, as an actor and writer in films and television; audiences worldwide know you for your work on TV's Satur- day Night Live,.and in such films such as Ghostbusters, The Blues Brothers, and many others. Most people are unaware, however, that you have a serious and long-stand- ing interest in the paranormal. What is it that draws and holds your attention to the paranormal in general, and to the UFO phenomenon in particular? DA: Actually, my primary interest in paranormal subjects and UFOlogy comes through the filter of an entertainer. These events are enormously stimulating to the creative community. The folklore of it is intriguing. Whether one believes or not, everyone has a perception and awareness that supernatural elements are a part of living on this planet, real or not. RH: I understand that your father, your grandfather, and even your great-grand- father were all followers of paranormal research; your great-grandfather was, in fact, a member of the Society for Psychi- cal Research. Can you tell us a little about the \"roots\", of your interest in things which are considered, for lack of a better term, \"paranormal\"? Is this something of a family tradition? Did your interest in the field begin early, or develop later? DA: My great-grandfather Dr. Samuel A. Aykroyd, a practicing dentist, was a chronicler who wrote extensively about the spiritualist pursuits of his time: spirit photography, automatic writing, trance- medium revelations, levitation of objects during seances and ectoplasmic materi- alization, the Fox sisters, and the nexus force study at the time-Lilydale, New York. My grandfather Morris was a Bell Tele- phone engineer. He passed the interest on to my father, who became a subscriber to the Journal of the American Society for Psychical Research. I read these jour- nals as a boy. An article on quantum physics and parapsychology, plus the Bowery Boys ghost movies of the 1940s, was the origin for our project Ghostbusters. RH: What was it that really, deeply sparked your ongoing interest in this field? That most got you interested in the paranormal (and UFOlogy) at a level more than just than that of a sort of \"passing interest\"? Anything in particu- lar? Was there a specific case, or event, that piqued your interest, or \"hooked\" you? Was it just the cumulative effect of the mass of material? Or something else? DA: As to UFOlogy, The Day the Earth Stood Still (1951), This Island Earth (1954), Earth vs. the Flying Saucers ( 1956), the 1950s Life magazine cover de- picting the photograph from the July, 1952, Washington, D.C, sightings were in the culture when I grew up in Hull, Que- bec, Canada. Then, in the 1980s, my wife and I had a high-altitude, high-speed sighting. See David Sereda's book, and my forward therein. We have a friend who is an as- trophysicist, very highly placed in the community; he says they were meteoric bolides, traveling in tandem. Maybe he's right. RH: You're the host of the syndicated television program (currently on cable's TNT) Psi Factor: Chronicles of the Paran- ormal. How did that series come about? Do (did) you have any input into the pro- gram, beyond the role of host? What, if anything, would you change about that show-or incorporate into some hypo- thetical new program related to the field? DA: Psi Factor grew from my brother Peter's contacts with a group similar to NIDS (National Institute for Discovery Science). We acquired the rights to two thousand of their cases. The first year of the show was great, because the files were strictly adhered to. Then the machine of TV took over, and the stuff got diluted. I loved our cast, though. The writers, when freed from sticking to case facts, did come up with some cool ideas. But for me, the first year was the best. RH: I understand that you are interested in the work of David Sereda. Can you tell us a little about your interest in his work, and about your own views on what he brings to the UFOlogical table? DA: David Sereda's insight into the Martyn Stubbs footage is very compel- ling. David's a thinker-very spiritual, linked to a positive shamanic energy. He puts the Sirius dog star, the chipped life-saver bogeys which were photo- graphed in England and also seen on the STS space shuttle tapes, together with the theory that there are benign beings • who are sentient and sensitive to Earth's environmental problems. They have a past link to our planet's history, and are healing the ozone layers with huge trans- lucent bags of water. I don't think this is material from the toilet on the windshield of the space shuttle, which Martyn Stubbs has pho- tographed and isolated. It's very con- vincing. You can argue with David all day long; he has held his own with NASA's best scientists. RH: Given your knowledge of and fa- miliarity with the field, your own hunches, your own insights, your private specula- tions and personal theorizing and so forth... what is Dan Aykroyd's perspective on the nature, the meaning, and the ultimate significance of the UFO phenomenon? DA: UFOs are material objects. They are technology, alloys; they have a spark that keeps them going. They're extra-di- mensional; they wink in and pop out, coming and going like so many taxis, in places like Rome, New York; the Sangre de Cristo Mountains; all over the world. Time and space are nothing to these machines, with a billion years of devel- opment on us. It's all Einstein-Rosen interstates to them!

I conducted a detailed interview with the woman over the phone, and was able to go to the scene to conduct an inter- view and investigation on Aug. 17. The following is a brief summary of the information I was able to obtain: The woman was making sandwiches for her husband's lunch when she real- ized that she had no lettuce in the refrig- erator. The family has their own vegetable garden, which was close to their home, so the woman decided to go outside at about 12:30 A.M. to gather some fresh lettuce.. The garden is off to the right side of the residence, and there is some illumina- tion in the area from a light that shines from the rear of their home. The woman picked the lettuce that she needed, then stood up and turned when her attention was drawn towards a tree about 8 feet away. Under the tree, with it's back leaning against the trunk, was a massive hair cov- ered man-like creature whose head was just touching an overhanging branch. The branch when measured was 96 inches off the ground. The creature was described as cov- ered with long black hair, arms down to the knees, and very broad shouldered. The woman, only seconds after seeing it, walked swiftly back into the house where she awakened two other family members, who responded within minutes with guns. When they went outside, the creature was gone. The grass under the tree ap- peared to have been freshly matted down. The family noticed that their dog, whose house was about 50 feet away from the garden, was not barking,and was hid- ing in the back of its pen-which was not normal. No sounds or smells were reported. The woman was so shocked to see the creature that she didn't watch it long enough to notice many details. She was quite upset by the experience and said This general sketch of a Bigfoot- like creature does not necessarily represent the reports in this article. that the height and body size of the crea- ture stuck in her mind. The witness stated to me that after the encounter she cried all night and was terrified. While I looked over the area for any possible evidence, about 50 feet away in another garden area I found two possible footprints that had apparently been there for awhile. There has been a lot of rain in the area, and the weather had indeed af- fected the condition of these prints. The tracks were about 15 inches long, but no toes could be discerned. There was a distance of about 42 inches be- tween the two possible prints. This is the same property where a Bigfoot was reported on two separate occasions last September. The family wishes to remain anonymous, and has asked me not to identify the location of these occurrences, other than to state that this is in Derry Township in Westmoreland County. This is a very wooded area with a large deer population. The area is not far from the Chestnut Ridge, a mountain range where numerous Bigfoot encounters have been reported for years. This woman has now had two encounters with a similar Bigfoot creature, and she has indicated to me that this last experience had really scared her. Other encounters reported: April 13, 2003-About 5 miles from the previous location, I had received a report of another possible Bigfoot en- counter that was reported by three wit- nesses. These people reported seeing a tall creature with its arms swinging, as it walked into a cornfield, and then ran off. The PA Bigfoot Society is investigating the incident as well. April or May, 2003-Scottdale, Fayette County-I interviewed a man in July, who-told me how he and his young daughter were riding a motor bike in a rural area when suddenly a figure emerged from the right and stopped directly in front of them at'a distance of about 75 feet. What they saw was described as \"a hairy man\" that was estimated to stand about 6 1/2 feet tall, had long arms, ap- peared to be stooped over, and was cov- ered with black hair. The creature looked at the two people for just seconds, then ran off into the woods. The witnesses returned home to tell the family about what they had seen. , The Pennsylvania Bigfoot Society is also investigating some other possible Bigfoot activity in the state. Several crop circle reports tied to UFO sightings in Italy The Italian Center for UFO Studies re- ports the month of June featured the bursting onto the scene of numerous \"cir- cular traces\" or crop circles in fields, and that 16 out of 47 were directly correlated with UFO reports. June had more UFO reports than any previous month this year, and the first half of 2003 is on a level with the year 2000, when there were 224 reports, but this year trails 2001 and 2002. The crop circles have also influenced the regional statistics, with Tuscany hav- ing 10 cases, followed by Piedmont and Marche with 6 cases each. A disc-shaped object was observed at close-range over Florence on 7 June; a triangular object was seen the same day in the province of Verbania; and a pilot who was flying over Benevento on 24 June observed a sort of \"missile.\" Check your label Please check your mailing label pe- riodically for the expiration date of your MUFON membership and MUFON UFO Journal subscription.

The witness states, \"As I watched through my viewfinder, I saw a round unidentified object fly from the east to the west towards a second jet plane, and appeared to hit it. Just before the round object hit the belly of the jet plane the lights on both wings and the tail flashed on together.

RAF B AWDSEY - John Cotton writes, \"I was a National Service fighter plotter stationed at RAF Bawdsey, a GCI site, and one night in late 1954, we were in the middle of an exercise when over the inter- com came the radar sighting of an uni- dentified flying object. \"At the time I was working in the RT recording area. As soon as the Meteor NF11 s interceptors we were controlling were sent to investigate, I started record- ing the intercept. This is the normal pro- cedure. \"As the interceptors approached and got visual contact with the target they reported that it was a stationary object (confirmed by radar) and \"saucer like\" in shape. On being ordered to approach closer, the target shot off at high speed and then hovered again. \"The second time the fighters neared, the target went straight up at very high speed until it disappeared off the Type 13 height RADAR. I, like many others in the \"hole,\" had gone into a control cabin that wasn't in use to see this phenom- ena. . \"The chief controller that night (either Fit Lt Jack Smith or Fit Lt Clifford) asked to hear the recording of the interception, but for the first time we could remember, there was no recording. It was a simple system of a continuous loop of clear film on which the voices and a time signal were 'scratched' and supposedly fool proof. The following morning we were not allowed to sleep in, but had to parade for the CO to remind us that the Official Se- crets Act applied to events of the previ- ous night.

We both could not believe it, and a woman near us said she wondered what that was as well. The next day our husbands talked to other people in the campground and told MUFON UFO Journal them what we had seen, and some other people reported seeing the same thing as well. This object was fairly large, and the night was very clear and the stars were visible. We never saw it again.\" Thanks to Peter Davenport NUFORC Wisconsin crop circle unusual MAYVBLLE - A farmer, Arthur Rantala, claims to have witnessed the formation of a crop circle in a barley field from the safety of his work shed during a violent morning storm on July 4. \"It looked like a lake, Rantala explained. \"The waves, the wind blowing, and then all of a sudden this dark hole appears, like a black hole. And then immediately, one to the right, then another to the cen- ter of it.\" Rantala said.

I was convinced it was a shoot- ing star, until it made a random course change. \"The object looked about the size of an airplane flying high. However, the light- ing was too bright, indicating that it was close. It flew from the center of the sky to the horizon in about five seconds, and made a hard turn to the right through a set of clouds flying south towards Marblehead. \"The object had three lights on the front in a triangle shape, and the lighting was orange. It definitely traveled through the clouds, because the clouds were illu- minated as it passed through. It moved way too fast to be a plane.\" Thanks to Peter Davenport, NUFORC Object over San Francisco SAN FRANCISCO - The witness re- ports, \"My husband and I were sitting on a bench at a marina in Berkeley, CA, looking across the Bay at the skyline of San Francisco on about June 30,2003, at 2 PM. There was some generalized fog, and there was a cover of clouds above the city. \"We observed a very dark cigar- shaped object move repetitively back and forth from one end of the city to the other, occasionally dipping into the clouds, but never descending below the cloud cover. The object did not appear to be moving fast, but it was covering considerable dis- tances in a short amount of time. \"It flew back and forth across the city in 45 seconds.

Suddenly, three bright equidistant white discs of light turned on a heading toward them, flying lower than 1,000 feet altitude at their 10 o 'clock position.

The witness reports, \"It was emitting a gloomy white light/haze all over, and there was a blinking sharp white light from the bottom. It was hovering-low in the horizon near the airport. It stayed in one position about 300 meters high, then moved slowly to the right while lowering itself. \"Then it came back to its original po- sition, but much closer to the ground and went out of sight, because it was lower than a building. It might have landed. Other people also saw it, but did not pay attention. It was not an airplane. Several airplanes flew by paying no attention to the UFO. \"I followed its movements and saw it from time to time covered by the trees. We all knew we had never seen anything like that before, and somehow I had a very nice relaxing feeling over the excitement of the unusual sight.\" Thanks to Peter Davenport, NUFORC Discs photographed in Florida KEY WEST - A professional photog- rapher called to report a sighting of six peculiar objects in the daytime sky over Key West on July 29,2003, at 1 PM. The objects appeared to him to be flip- ping and maneuvering in the sky, giving off different colors, and turning dark or black, during the fifteen 15 minutes he watched. There were five other adult wit- nesses. The craft were disc-shaped and peculiar in appearance. They were illumi- nated with a strange color. The witness took several photos of the objects, and stated that he would for- ward them. He reported the sighting to the local newspaper, The Key West Citi- zen. Thanks to Peter Davenport, NUFORC Strange object in Michican ^ LANSING —The witness was travel- ing about 1.5 miles west of downtown Lansing at 1:20 PM, when he saw some- thing traveling southbound over the trees on July 31,2003. He states, \"I would estimate that it was just east of downtown, and looked very long and short like a rectangle, but could have been any shape as I was viewing it from the side. Lansing has an airport, but this was unlike any plane. The craft had a rectangular-shaped structure, like a triangular framework with steel beams or something. It looked like it was flying on a downward angle, but go- ing away from the airport. It traveled very flat and quickly for its size. The 747 commercial aircraft float along, and this UFO was moving 4 or 5 times faster than that. The UFO was flying lower than commercial aircrafland disappeared behind the treeline. Thanks to Peter Davenport, NUFORC Objects affect electricity? MINNESOTA, NEAR THE IOWA BORDER - The witness reports, \"On Aug. 5, 2003, at 5:08 AM, we woke up and had no water. The circuit breaker was OK, so it had to be something going on in the well house. I left the house at 5 AM, driving west in heavy rain on a gravel road lined with cornfields. \"The cloud ceiling was about 9,000 feet, with a temperature of 62 degrees. As I rounded a curve I saw two red lights in between a band of white light. I got a little closer to these lights and decided to turn on my high beams to see better. \"Immediately, the white light in be- tween the two red lights went off, and the two red lights started to move at a faster speed over the next hill. I could make out two red lights at about 25 feet altitude moving west parallel to the road! This placed the lights ten feet above the elec- tric wires. \"I saw an occasional beam of white light come from the craft directed at farm- houses as it passed. The red lights then went over the hill, and I sped up to see, and one of the red lights zoomed off to the west. \"The other red light, now 65 feet high, stopped dead. The red light then turned on three banks of white and red lights, with six lights in the top row, eight lights in the middle row, and six lights in the bottom row. \"The UFO was above a farm house and moved 300 feet to the north and stopped. The object turned a pale shade of lime, and I could make out the distinct shape of a black saucer with some sort of 'stem.' The saucer turned on a multitude of lights with lime green beams that lit up the grove of the farmhouse. \"You could see the black of night in between the shafts,.and it lit up the whole grove. I parked and watched this display 1/8 of a mile away from it. To the west, I saw the night sky light up from saucer #2.1 watched for a couple of minutes, and a few other cars slowed down, but did not stop. \"I then turned south and headed for work with saucer #1 still blazing light lime green, while saucer #2 was throbbing with orange light. \"Later, I left work to get parts to fix the well. The passing saucers, who could have been pinching electricity, probably fried the solid state-switching unit in my well. When I came back, my wife said she had heard a noise similar to a gunshot and the electricity had gone out. \"The local electrical provider came out and found a problem with a transformer and had to replace a section of under- ground cable on the road where I saw the two saucers.\" e-mail report.

UFOs. Prophecy and The End of Time is the culmination of interviews con- ducted over several years with leading researchers, authors, and some well- known experiencers of the UFO abduc- tion phenomenon, as well as leaders in the field of prophecy and authors of reli- gious studies. Sean begins by sharing his personal turmoil related to the attacks on the World Trade Center on Sept. 11, 2001 and the disbelief and shock that he and the entire country experienced. What follows is a partial transcript of the now well-known video showing Osama Bin Laden meet- ing with fellow terrorists in Afghanistan discussing a topic that certainly got my attention when I heard it: the dreams and visions that his so-called \"brothers\" had about the attack they were planning. According to the tape, no one except those planning the attack knew anything about the operation, and according to Bin Laden, none of the \"brothers\" who had dreams or visions about that upcoming fateful day knew about it either. Bin Laden even told one of his \"brothers\" that if he had another dream, not to tell anybody \"...because people will be upset with him.\" I did not hear much in the media con- cerning Bin Laden mentioning these dreams and visions his \"brothers\" had prior to the attack, and without their September 2003 knowledge of what was being planned. As with much of what the American me- dia refuses to report on, 1 found their lack of interest disappointing, but typical. Do people have dreams and visions of future events? Are people abducted by alien beings? Do people see angels? Do people see God? Can people act as a chan- nel for another being or consciousness? Is there really prophecy in the Bible? These are just a few of the complex questions that are addressed in this book. Sean provides an- swers to explain these topics by giv- ing the reader ex- amples of prophecy through dreams, prophecy in the Bible, and the possi- bility that there is mention of alien beings in scripture. He builds a credible argument for the rela- tionship between the gods and angels of ancient times and the aliens of our own time. Sean writes, \"My own belief is that both the Bible and the UFO phenomenon are inseparably related and represent a form of divine revelation from the Heav- enly Ones On High, who themselves de- termine the moment they make the truth of their existence and presence known to the world in general. An unplanned, seem- ingly accidental \"discovery\" of the truth is not possible without them. There is no proof of God in the most objective terms unless he himself makes that truth evi- dent through his own divine revelation of himself. Seeing is believing, but only when God is ready for us to see.\" Sean shares a very interesting excerpt published in Joseph Campbell's Occiden- tal Mythology, The Masks of God from \"The Acts of John,\" an alleged book of the Bible that was left out because the Council of Nicaea condemned it. This is an excerpt you will want to read in its entirety to see the similarities be- tween an event that was written about almost two thousand years ago and events that abductees report today. Many abductees and abduction re- searchers have been interviewed by Sean MUFON UFO Journal Casteel over the years and he shares parts of those interviews with the reader. His focus in this set of interviews was to determine what their moral and reli- gious perspectives are concerning their research and/or experiences. Partial in- terviews are provided with Raymond Fowler, Betty Andreasson Luca ; Whit- ley Strieber, Linda Cortile, Budd Hopkins, Dr. Leo Sprinkle and myself. Dr. Leo Sprinkle discusses how he became involved in the study of the UFO phenomenon, his meeting with Arthur C. Clarke, his perspectives on \"positive\" ETs versus \"negative\" ETs, and what his feel- ings are relating to prophecy. The tragedy of Heaven's Gate is re- visited by way of a revealing interview with Rio DiAngelo, the survivor of the cult and the man who led the police to the cult members' bodies. Sean explores whether the cult's doctrine was sound or not in a discussion with \"...one of the most often read and innovative scholars of the early Christian church,\" Elaine Pagels, Ph.D. who has written several books on Gnostic Christianity. Gnostic Christianity involves a sys- tem of belief of early Christian groups that valued inquiry into spiritual truth above faith. Gnostic Christians believed that salvation was only attainable by the few whose faith enabled them to tran- scend matter. They also viewed Christ as non-corporeal. Sean interviewed Budd Hopkins the same year of the Heaven's Gate tragedy to determine what his opinions were on the suicides, and for people who know Budd, it is not surprising that his ap- proach would be a pragmatic one. Impor- tantly, Budd brought out the true \"UFO relationship\" to the Heaven's Gate cult: there was no relationship. Quoting Hopkins, \"I pointed out how the UFO cults such as this one, that has no knowledge of the UFO phenomenon whatsoever, and no personal experience, is essentially a situation of'all beliefs and no miracles.' Whereas, we investigators are looking at a phenomenon that is in effect 'all miracles and no beliefs.'\" An excellent chapter is dedicated to an interview with Gary Stearman, a re- searcher and writer for Prophecy In The News. Stearman says he has collected a library of two or three thousand volumes on the Bible and has spent the last 30 years of his life totally immersed in the subject. According to Stearman, events proph- esied long ago in the Bible are now be- coming our reality. It seems that the proph- ecy of the past is the present. Not to get the reader lost in prophecy and things unseen, UFOs, Prophecy and Page 15"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"The End of Time keeps its focus. The now referred to 1967 \"Incident in Montana\" is discussed. For those individuals new to the field, this was an incident where Min- uteman Missiles shut down when lights were observed to be flying over the facil- ity from which they were controlled. The reader will find himself or herself corning full circle back to Raymond Fowler. I was amazed to read about the life this man has lived and what he has accomplished, as if he had a destiny to fulfill, but I will leave the rest of those details for the reader to discover. What is a study of UFOs, Prophecy and the End Time if one does not look into the phenomenon of channeling? Here Sean dedicates a chapter to his interviews with Diane Tessman. Diane channels an entity named Tibus whom she met on her family's farm in Iowa when she was a little girl- The encounter involved what she per- ceived as a light coming down from the sky. She had no fear, but years later, while under hypnosis with abduction re- searcher Dr. R. Leo Sprinkle, she recalled \".. .being taken on board a craft and en- countering a man who looked human and had tawny or gold colored hair.\" Tessman believes her soul was \".. .a soul that was always intended to be part of the change times or to ring alarms about the condi- tion of the planet.\" Ancient prophecies from other cul- tures are also explored in an interview with Judith Bluestone Polich, author of Return of the Children of Light: Incan and Mayan Prophecies For a New World. This is a look at prophecies that are hun- dreds of years old, but seem to be for the present day. Interestingly, Ms. Polich has also had a powerful experience during a medita- tion which,\".. .filled me with deep love, a sense of well-being, .and a penetrating clarity.\" .- Astrological forecasts of Dr. Louis Turi are explored in relationship to the theory of End Times. I must admit I have absolutely no knowledge of anything astrological, other than I know what my astrological sign is. Even so, it seems to me that if there is not a \"science\" to it all, there is certainly an art to it, in that it takes a special per- son to be able to truly understand and apply astrology to events of our time. Interestingly, Turi says he became inter- ested in the study of astrology \"...by a series of encounters with UFOs that be- gan in his childhood.\" Probably the most famous abductee who has \"come out\" to date is Whitley Strieber, author of several books about his abductions and visitations by alien beings. Whitley discusses his latest book The Key, which is about a visit from a mysterious being. Strieber is not sure if this was a very unusual human or an alien, but this being allegedly gave Strieber a \"blueprint\" for mankind's future, including information concerning coming changes in the makeup of mankind. He writes, \"One re- sult of those changes will be in the way we relate to the world of the dead, which we will come to access as easily as walk- ing across the street.\" My first thought when I read this is that is seems reminiscent of the coming time the Bible speaks of when we (those of us who are lucky) will walk with God. Not that this means death, but rather that the barriers between our existence and other dimensions and the creative force will no longer exist as we perceive it. Per- haps because of a future change in the physical and spiritual makeup of mankind, we will be able to achieve this. . A later chapter of the book covers in- terviews Sean conducted with Dr. Joe Lewels, author of The God Hypothesis. Dr. Lewels' belief is that we are not really seeing a type of invasion by large-eyed hostile aliens, but a new relationship with the beings who created us and have pro- tected us since our creation. One of the tenets of The God Hypoth- esis is that there is \".. .a huge difference between the God of the Old Testament and the later God who brought Jesus Christ into the world.\" Lewels believes the basic experiences that abductees de- scribe are not much different from \".. .what was described in the past by the ancients.\" When Sean asked Lewels for his opin- ion on the prophecies given to abductees, Lewels responded by saying, \"In my re- search, I have found that the people we call abductees have uniformly been given some kin'd of message that the world is in trouble...They have been shown visions....of the things that we're doing wrong on Earth...They're aware'of the bad things that .we do to animals and other species. They're cognizant of all this, and it comes to them from their experiences.\" One of the last two chapters of the book covers another interview with Gary Stearman. I found this interview very in- teresting-there is so much information he shares with Sean relating to his specific area of study that I cannot give it justice hi a book review. It really is something you will want to read in the context of the line of reasoning that Sean puts forth in UFOs, Prophecy and The End of Time. When I finished this book, I wondered if other readers will recognize what I did while reading it.Everyone interviewed in this book seems to have experienced what they consider an incredible life-changing event in their lives, which in turn led them on their present life path. Interestingly, it seems that the two common themes everyone has touched on as being life changing involved either seeing a UFO, accepting God (or the Cre- ative Force) into their lives, or both. Portions of many interviews Sean has conducted since 1989 make up this book, and they all seem to come together with Sean's insightful logic. To quote the .author, \"The similarities to what Diane Tessman and Judith Blue- stone Polich and others in this book have had to- say are obvious, and therein may lie a testimony to the truthfulness of their message: even though they all draw their information from different sources, the consistency of their predictions is noth- ing short of remarkable.\" Prior to writing this review, I was not sure if I was knowledgeable enough about the subjects of UFOs, prophecies and the end of time to adequately review this book, and I am not even sure if I have done a good job. However, I can say this, I am very glad I read UFOs, Prophecy and The End of Time. When I finished this book, I real- ized there is a common thread running through the lives of many people in our world, and I am glad that some of us real- ize it-better still, I am glad we know about each other.

The fact that someone was able to put such a site together is itself incredible, but more incredible is the fact that it was started by a 15-year-old high school stu- dent. Now, some seven years later, John Greenewald, Jr. is a veteran researcher at the ripe old age of 22. This book is a rich combination of topics that will keep you reading, begin- ning with how the Black Vault was started and developed, and ending with exten- sive instructions on how to use the Free- dom of Information Act (FOIA). In between are fas- cinating examples of documents which Greenewald has ob- tained over the past seven years from such agencies as the De- fense Intelligence Agency, the National Security Agency, The Central Intelligence Agency, and, of course, even the Air Force. There is also a helpful index. The young re- searcher was fascinated with UFOs and science fiction, but quickly became frus- trated with \"the same stories, the same lies, the same unanswered questions\" when he went on the internet to find reli- able information. One story surfaced, however, that was different-it actually provided docu- mentation as to its source, which was said to be the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA). The report, which came through the Department of Defense Joint Chiefs of Staff Message Center, was exciting. It stated that the Imperial Iranian Air Force scrambled an F-4 from Shahrokhi AFB near Tehran, Iran, at 0130 hours (1:30 a.m.) on Sept. 19, 1976, to check out a bright object. As the F-4 approached to within 25 nautical miles of the object, the aircraft lost all instrumentation and communica- tions. The pilot turned away from the object, and soon all instrumentation and communications returned. A second F-4 was launched at 0140, and the backseater acquired a radar lock on the object at 28 nautical miles. As the plane got within 25 nautical miles the object moved away at a speed visible on the radar scope, and stayed 25 nautical miles from the approaching aircraft. The size of the radar return was the that of a 767 tanker, but the visual size September 2003 y o n d c y was difficult to discern because of its brightness-a flashing strobe arranged in a rectangular pattern, and alternating blue, green, red, and orange in a sequence so rapid that all four colors could be seen at once. A second bright object one-half to one- third the apparent size of the moon sud- denly came out of the original object and headed rapidly toward the F-4. The pilot attempted to fire an AIM-9 missile at the object, but his weapons control panel shut off, and he lost all com- munications. The pilot turned and initiated a negative G dive, fol- lowed by the second object about 2 to 4 nau- tical miles behind. Then the second object re- turned to the initial ob- ject. Shortly after the sec- ond object joined up with the primary object, another object appeared to come out of the other side of the primary ob- ject, moving straight down and coming to rest gently on the earth, cast- ing a bright light over an area of 2-3 kilometers. The F-4 crew, which had now regained communications, descended from 26,000 feet to 15,000 feet to observe the object on the ground and mark its location. After experiencing some additional in- terference on UHF and the interphone, the F-4 landed, but on the final approach ob- served a cylinder-shaped object with steady lights on each end and a flasher in the center at 10,000 feet. The object passed over the F-4. The tower said there was no other traffic in the area, but tower person- nel observed the object after it had passed over the F-4. During daylight the F-4 crew was taken by helicopter to where they thought the object had landed, but observed nothing. However, as they circled to the west of the area they picked up a beeper signal near a small house. The residents of the house reported a loud noise and bright light during the night. After reading this report, Greenewald was determined to see if it was legitimate, using the FOIA. Four weeks after request- ing the information, it was received from theDIA. Excited at what he had found, he frantically searched the internet for simi- lar documents, but found nothing else that appeared to be legitimate. \"Not one website focused on these nuggets of truth,\" he explains. Greenewald began to learn \"the art of MUFON UFO Journal the FOIA,\" and sent off as many as 40 requests at a time, initially finding no documents as exciting as the one about Iran. But he later found an interesting addition to the Iran report, which he in- cludes in the book. However, he quickly discovered that \"the story these documents were telling me about the conspiracy was undeniable, and I knew this was going to be an inter- esting ride. Unknown to me, I would not find the truth as easily as I thought.\" His next step was to create a site on the internet so that he could share what he found. Since much of the material on the documents was blacked out, and since he was building a vault of information, he decided to call his site the Black Vault. While there has been fun and excite- ment in filling the Black Vault, there has been a great deal of frustration, including long delays and even misinformation. Among the interesting documents was one from the National Security Agency (NSA) which discussed one of its agents attending the MUFON Inter- national Symposium in Dayton, OH, and talking with Len Stringfield about two let- ters which Stringfield had discussed, and which the agent thought were fraudulent, offering to have them \"checked out.\" Another document worth looking at was the CIA translation of a Russian ar- ticle about the MIR space station, which reported that on May 21,1991, a Russian cosmonaut filmed a UFO that came up to the space station. The report ends with: \"Well, we will have to wait for further reports. The fact is quite interesting indeed, and perhaps, fairly alarming.\" Greenewald notes that \"translated articles such as these proved only one thing: the fact that the CIA still, after all of these years, actively collected UFO reports, records, and newspaper ar- ticles, but for what reason?\" There is much, much more in this very interesting book, including key docu- ments, a list of 112 government agencies and how to contact them, 160 acronyms that researchers may encounter, and even the full text of the CIA's Robertson Panel Report and conclusions. Greenewald has created an outstand- ing web site (www.blackvault.com) of more than 100,000 documents, and it has received a great deal of use-the record being more than 6,000,000 hits in a 24- hour period (after an NBC documentary). He has done all this, beginning at age 15, with his own limited and donated funds in order to make the information available to researchers at no cost. Not many of us will make such a con- tribution to ufology in our lifetimes-and certainly not by age 22. Page 17"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"PERCEPTIONS By Stanton T. Friedman Stanton Friedman It's Impossible, isn't it? I have often said that I wish all Uni- versity Professors who teach courses in engineering would have to spend a couple of years out in the real world, say in in- dustry, before teaching at a university after getting their PhDs. The real world of problem solving is often very different from the artificial world of the class- room and textbook. Equally useful, I am convinced, would be forcing those who get their PhDs in sci- ences like physics and chemistry and geology to take a course possibly entitled \"It's im- possible, isn't it?\" They would study a host of claims of impossibility from the past that we now know, with the benefit of hindsight, were wrong, and then look at similar claims current in today's academic worlds. Initial assumptions would be re- viewed, as would the supposed basis for them, as would counter information then available that would have allowed for the impossibility to be possible. Why was it claimed that flight was impossible, that speeds greater than the speed of sound were impossible for an airplane, that space travel was impossible, that there could be no water on Mars, that only chemical processes could pro- duce the energy of the sun, etc, etc?. I am sure that one major precept that would be discovered is that the assump- tions being made by the advanced aca- demics were flat out wrong-and often un- spoken.- Another would be that rarely has the academic studied the literature, poor as it might be, relevant to the problem at hand, but rather assumed that, if there had been any, he would have known about it. Still another is that in every age we have dis- covered that there are totally new con- cepts that need to be expected rather than assuming we know all the basic science we need to. Think of radioactivity, quantum me- chanics, lasers, sonar, radar, etc. Surely it is unreasonable to expect that an entirely new concept will be fully developed to compete with ideas having had millions spent on their development over many years. Some bad concepts include the follow- ing: 1. If it can't be seen using the naked eye, it isn't real.   . Consider how bacteria and viruses wreaked havoc before the development, of ever more powerful microscopes. How many women died because leading doc- tors of the 19 th century honestly believed there was no need to wash their hands between doing autopsies and delivering, babies. It is interesting that it took many years between the discovery that eating liver could help cure pernicious anemia (based, on experiments with dogs) and the even- tual discovery that it was the Vitamin B- 12 in the liver (in minuscule amounts) that. was the active factor. It took years of hard work to identify and isolate vitamins. At least the British navy found out that scurvy could be re- duced in sailors by making sure they had enough citrus fruit. This was long before Vitamin C was discovered. We sometimes act as though distant galaxies weren't created until we had powerful telescopes to observe them. 2. Systems evolved for use in one situ- ation can be evaluated for another, as- suming the same circumstances. The use of the gas turbine in aviation (jet engines) was long delayed because it was presumed that a gas turbine would have to be heavy, since all earth-bound ones were. But they had been designed on the basis of low cost and high effi- ciency, rather than for light weight and high temperatures as would be required in aircraft. New alloys had to be devel- oped, and new manufacturing tech- niques, but certainly jets have justified their development. In the space program one argument against man in space was that it would be necessary to communicate with the as- tronauts, and the weight of the radio equipment.and the amount of power re- quired for it would be prohibitive. After all, radio stations broadcast over short distances at power levels as high as 100,000 watts. On the Pioneer spacecraft, the trans- mitter operated at a power of 8 watts (roughly a Xmas tree light bulb) and sent back signals from several billion miles away. Of course the signal was sent only towards Earth, not in all directions, and a ;huge antenna was used (250') to receive the signal. The equipment was optimized for the special situation of a small satel- lite launched on a rocket and communi- cating to home base from a great distance. 3. Having a PhD in one field somehow makes one an expert in other areas. Pronouncements about the impossi- bility of space travel have often been made by bright people who had no idea that there was already a large body of good work done prior to their making their pronouncements-and which invali- dated their assumptions. A Nobel prize-winning physicist from Harvard, Dr. Edward Purcell, was quite willing to publish a foolish claim about the impossibility of star travel, assuming an acceleration of one g for 5 years and then a deceleration at one g to reach a star 10 light years away-and then repeat- ing the process on the return. He assumed that all fuel (using matter antimatter annihilation) for the trip had to be included at the start. A simple calcula- tion shows that it takes only one year at 1G to reach close to the speed of light and that there is no point in accelerating after that, as opposed to coasting, since all one accomplishes is increasing ones mass and wasting energy. Would Dr. Purcell have had a 747 ac- celerating for half the distance to its tar- get city as opposed to reaching a reason- able constant velocity arid cruising in- stead for most of the trip.? 4. The essence of science is repro- ducibility, so that there is no scientific work on flying saucers. There is a great deal of science that can be done without reproducibility. For example, careful observation and descrip- tion can be very important, as can prepa- ration for the study of events that can't, by their nature, be reproduced by the ex- perimenter. Eclipses can be predicted, but they cannot be controlled by the experimental observer-nor can the weather be con- trolled. They can be studied scientifically. Earthquakes and solar storms cannot be predicted very accurately, but we can have instruments ready to observe them Page 18 MUFON UFO Journal September 2003"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"when they occur, such as seismographs and detectors for paniculate radiation from the sun. Finally, there are all those events in- volving intelligence (good or bad) which can't be rejected, controlled, or easily be reproduced, but can be scientifically stud- ied after the event has occurred. These include rapes, murders, automobile acci- dents, airplane crashes-and observations of flying saucers. Rape kits can produce samples for DNA determination for later comparison with the DNA of a suspect. Fingerprints, ballistic data, clothing samples, and other forensically testable items can be care- fully collected and evaluated. Skid marks and blood alcohol levels can be measured. Careful review and replaying of an ob- servation can produce information about apparent size, apparent speed, apparent color, effects in physical trace cases, etc. One can learn a great deal by careful wit- ness interrogation, by carefully dpne po- lice lineups, and by cross comparisons with various shapes of other flying sau- cers that have been observed. It is the approach to the problem that needs to be scientific. This does not nec- essarily involve reproducibility. That is why big-time trials can take so long, be- cause there are rules of evidence and loads of testimony to be evaluated. There are many civilian matters as well as the obvious criminal situations that require careful review of testimony and evalua- tion of data. Whose fault was it when the aircraft landing gear collapsed? The maker of the metal, the builder of the plane, the pilot, the control tower? Rarely can the acci- dent be reproduced in view of the cam- eras and with instrumentation in place. 5. Our increasing knowledge cer- tainly makes certain events more likely. Right now there are serious academic discussions about whether or not there is life on Mars and how many earthlike planets there are in the universe. We are told that, if we do indeed find water on Mars, that increases the probability of there being life there. How? It is there or it isn't. What we know matters not at all, much as we would like to think it does. There is a whole long history of false proclama- tions about what the surface of both Mars and Venus are like. These were based on theoretical constructs having nothing to do with what the real surfaces were like. Venus was thought to be a sort of tropical paradise. Apparently primarily because there were thick clouds, and what else could clouds be but water.? Turns out they are sulphuric acid, the tempera- tures are not just very warm, but often hot enough to melt lead. Absence of evi- dence often means loudly shouted claims. Similarly in the past few years many dozens of stars would seem to have large planets revolving around them. Some will say that the more planets we discover, the more likely there is an earth-like planet around some other star. Again, finding large planets in our lo- cal neighborhood, using techniques in- sufficiently accurate to directly observe earth-sized planets, tells us absolutely nothing about whether such planets ex- ist or whether there is intelligent life there. It is or it isn't. None of the academic discussions about where intelligent life is consider the possibility of migration, colonization, or terraforming to make suitable places where there were no indigenous ones before. As a matter of fact, all these high level academic discussions about these mat- ters supposedly by people very interested in extraterrestrial life, intelligent or bacte- rial, never refer in a serious way to the fact that there is overwhelming evidence that intelligent extraterrestrials are com- ing here. The emperors have no clothes. We who are seriously interested in fly- ing saucers need to demand rigor in our thinking, and in^that of those who make inappropriate judgements based on non- existent data. Science is a process much abused by the nasty noisy negativists.

A March 2,1953, memo, stamped SE- CRET SECURITY INFORMATION, was sent to James Lay of the NSC by Hugh D. Farley of the NSC staff. The Memorandum states, \"It seems to me that the enclosed IAC report on fly- ing saucers might be of interest to Mr. C. D. Jackson. Its recommendations in para- graphs 4a and b concern psychological matters, but provide no assurance that anybody will do anything about them.\" ,, Paragraphs 4a and b of the report rec- ommend debunking, intelligence training, and public education on the UFO matter. According to records of the Eisenhower Library, C. D. Jackson served as Special Assistant to the President from Feb. 16,1953, to March 31,1954. \"His responsibility was loosely de- fined as international affairs, cold war planning, and psychological warfare.\" Jackson also worked closely with the Psychological Strategy Board, which still maintains classified records at the Eisenhower Library. No further documents related to- the Robertson Report were found in the Jackson or Lay general files. Newly-released documents reveal UFO chases in the 1950's Newly-released military documents show that fighter aircraft were scrambled to intercept strange shapes in Britain's skies in the 1950's. The formerly secret papers obtained from the US military give an insight into a chain of events sparked by sightings over East Anglia in 1956. Dave Clarke, an author researching the subject, secured the classified documents under the U.S. Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). After receiving numerous calls report- ing bright lights darting.across the sky, fighters from RAF Lakenheath reportedly spent more than seven hours trying to shoot down the objects, which were picked up on army radar screens. One US Air Force intelligence report described how \"12 to 15\" objects were picked up on radar screens on Aug. 13, 1956, and tracked for more than 50 miles. One object was reportedly logged trav- eling at 4,000 mph. \"Operators making these radar sightings are of the opinion that malfunctions of equipment did not cause these radar sightings,\" the docu- ment said. The radar logs describe white lights darting across the skies. At times, the objects traveled in formation and per- formed sharp turns. One document describes how an ob- ject was tracked by radar for 26 miles be- fore it hovered for five minutes then flew away again. A cable was sent from US Air Force Headquarters in Washington noting the \"considerable interest and concern\" with the sightings and demand- ing an immediate inquiry.

It is a topic that has al- ways grabbed my attention-! was looking into them before the media discovered them, and in the booklet \"Mystery of the Circles\" (co-written with Paul Fuller for BUFORA in 1986) actually produced what is arguably the first ever book about them. For a long time it seemed that the an- tics of two artists-come-hoaxers (the in- famous Doug and Dave) had killed off the subject. However, they are not an is- sue to be demolished that easily, and the recent movie (Signs) ensured that a new generation has come to consider them in the context of alien UFOs. So is there any sign (pardon the pun!) that the circles are going to provide hard evidence of an alien origin? A few ba- sics: Firstly, it is important to state what we know with reasonable assurance (al- though I am positive that some readers . will disgree with me). Crop circles can be hoaxed, often have been hoaxed, and are the subject of an intensive campaign to do just that. Bands of fakers, artists, showmen, and simply people who love playing jokes have adopted these marks in crop fields as a cause celebre and have honed their skills over many years. They see the fool- ing of the circle community as their duty, and also seek to outdo one another in ever more daring locations. Whilst it is often argued that many circles are too complex to be faked, those responsible have from time to time proven that they can do it. Moreover, there are lots of'other incentives. Some fanners make more out of crop circles on their land than they do from farming the crop, espe- cially in areas where circle hunters are Page 20 likely to trample all over the field each summer on the lookout. I do not blame any who decide to give the cropwatchers what they want-although they are rela- tively few in number and most farmers are genuinely puzzled when a circle forms on their land. Also it should never be forgotten that crop circles are now a tourist attraction, and the only way to ensure that tourists (and their money) return next summer is to give a good circle harvest for them to look at. Whilst I do not suggest that tourist boards are routinely faking circles to at- tract visitors I would be amazed if they do not relax any efforts to catch or pros- ecute those who do, just as I doubt the politicians in and around Loch Ness are too bothered about dubious or hoax sightings of the monster. Another factor is that circles have to some extent entered the public conscious- ness like UFOs did in the 1950s. Indeed to some extent they have taken over the zeit- geist from UFOlogy. As such they are a useful tool for promotion, and some of the circles being created are being made to promote things- from movies to news- papers to records to TV shows. Every sample of crop circles contains such a high degree of fakes created for whatever reason that I have long been refraining from investigating new pat- terns. It is a pointless exercise in my view because so many of them will be of doubt- ful provenance. •And, of course, fake circles are more likely to be those creating a pattern, rather than simple crude circles. They need to look stunning to do their job as a hoax. Consequently I have huge reservations about the credibility of any of the com- plex pictorial designs that fill magazines, newspapers, and TV shows these days. If you can never be sure that your evi- dence is worth a bean, then why investi- gate? Real circles So are there any real circles, or is at all a gigantic circus? I do think there are a few marks created by something, yes. There are strong reasons for believing that. Firstly, there have always been circles, long before the media gave them a name MUFON UFO Journal or any degree of concentrated hoaxing was dreamt up. There are plenty of cases in early UFO records (saucer nests they were often termed). Examples occur in Victorian science journals. Even folk tales from hundreds of years ago feature evidence that these marks were being seen in fields and dei- fied according to the legends of the time. UFO landing marks are only the space age equivalent of the handmark of the devil or some supernatural entity as was once believed the case. Secondly, there are some strong eye- witness stories of circles under formation. These involve both light phenomena and vortex forces descending from the sky to suggest that some physical phenomenon is creating them. Rarely do such cases even hint at some kind of alien sculptor, but seem better to fit some kind of atmospheric process; col- lectively they tend to rule out the idea that all are the result of hoaxing: Thirdly, circles do not form only in crop fields. They are most obvious in that medium because the deformed crop stays bent and leaves the mark for weeks or months to become a center of attention. Hoaxers are obviously going to fake marks somewhere thatmaxmizes the chances of their handiwork being seen. But any actual phenomenon not the result of human engineering would have a more random selection of environments in which to appear. This is a key test of the natural versus intelligent design theo- ries. Circles do appear in many places where they are visible for only short peri- ods. I have investigated cases (involving eyewitness sightings) where what clearly looks like a crop circle turned up in grass (where it is almost immediately blown out), reeds (equally unstable), even on a wet road surface (where its currency was measured in minutes, not weeks). Yet all of these were simple circles- not complex patterns-as are virtually all well-documented eyewitness cases of circles seen forming. These are further reasons to doubt the veracity of the com- plex pictorial designs seen today. Is there a UFO component? Are crop circles, assuming some are a real phenomenon, of historical nature, rel- September 2003"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"evant to UFOs? Indeed they are, because they seem to involve atmospheric forces, glowing lights, even physiological effects on witnesses in rarer instances. These are all features of the UFO mys- tery and cement this bond. It is my view that there are things of value to be learned about the UFO phenomenon through the crop circles that have some likely exist- ence beyond the realms of an artistic cre- ation. Of course, it is always possible that an alien intelligence is guiding these marks and trying to tell us something thereby (although, if so, it is about time they changed tactics, as the earth is proving exceedingly dumb at reading their inten- tions!). However, this is a hypothesis that re- quires much more consideration than it gets, because it would have to explain the long history of such marks and their formation in mediums where no intelligent intent would expect them to be seen and studied by humanity. For me, all the signs point away from an intelligent design and towards some kind of energy phenomenon that could teach us useful things about the atmo- sphere. Those signs of intelligence that do exist concern the complex patterns, and in my opinion reflect a human (not an alien) intelligence at work. Indeed they even once proved that by spelling out the message, \"We are not alone\"...Only a human could have writ- ten that, because an alien would have had to say, \"You are not alone.\" MUFONOhio to feature Talbott A MUFON of Ohio state meeting is scheduled for Nov. 1, featuring Nancy Talbott of BLT Research, who will be speaking on credible scientific research into crop circles and other anomalous events.

Well, maybe not. NASA researchers hope to conduct an experiment that could deter- mine if the force of gravity might some- day be adjusted, like the volume of a ra- dio. The space agency says that turning down the gravity in the immediate vicin- ity of a rocket would enable future space- craft to roam the galaxy by using the tug of distant planets and stars. Scientists have historically dismissed talk of antigravity machines as utter non- sense. But at a rare, closed-door confer- ence at NASA's Lewis Research Center in Cleveland, OH, scientists representing major universities, national weapons labo- ratories, defense contractors and the cor- porate research and development com- munity gathered to hear a detailed ac- count of the space agency's progress in attempting to build a machine that once seemed beyond the bounds of possibil- ity.

However, after interviews with attendees, Popular Mechanics has learned that a group of researchers at NASA's Marshall Manned Space Flight Center in Hunts- ville, AL, has nearly completed building a device that could make it possible to reduce gravitational attractions in its im- mediate vicinity. Part of the reason for the secrecy is that the very thought of such a machine defies conventional scientific wisdom. To understand why, it's helpful to know there are two complementary but not entirely compatible explanations for gravity. Isaac Newton, the first physicist, de- scribed gravity as an attraction between two masses. Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity suggests mass actu- ally causes space-time to warp around it. Imagine, for instance, the indentation cre- ated by placing a bowling ball on a soft bed. Both theories explain why apples fall from trees. Scientists consider Einstein's theory superior because it explains also why light-which has no mass-appears to bend in strong gravitational fields. Light, as the theory goes, follows the mass-induced curve in space-time. Viewing gravity this way makes it more of a feature of the universe. Italian book claims Aviano underground base Italian Center for UFO Studies reports that a new book called An Alien Base At Aviano? is sparking the interest and a little incredulity in the Italian mass media. Ufologist Antonio Chiumiento claims that an underground alien base is located in the region of Aviano, not far from the busy US Air Force Base. His conclusion was reportedly reached after a six-year study of the ex- periences of a young factory worker sup- posedly abducted several times, and taken inside the alien base, as well as into outer space. He allegedly took photo- graphs of the aliens, and became a sort of \"spokesperson\" for the extraterrestrials. The book reveals the results of Chiumiento's investigations and analy- ses.

The Stars; At 9 PM in mid-October the nose of Pegasus, the upside-down flying horse, touches the celestial meridian. From the nose star Enif, a bent row of stars (head and neck) traces eastward to Markab, one of the 4 stars in the Great Square (horse's body). The other 3 stars, moving clockwise, are Algenib, Alpheratz, and Scheat. The sides of the square measure roughly 15 degrees each. Alpheratz actually belongs to the Chained Princess Andromeda, a twin row of stars curving NE from the square. The 2 types of star clusters are present at the same time during mid-evening hours. Low in the ENE is the Pleiades, while higher in the NE is the Double Clus- ter of Perseus. Both are fine examples of open or galactic clusters. Binoculars and telescopes show them as rather widely separated groups of stars. Globular clusters, on the other hand, are very compact assemblages of hun- dreds of thousands of stars.

(AP)- A little bit of duckweed and some inflatable houses could help turn the caves of Mars into a home for any future human visitors to the red planet. The Martian caves would protect hu- mans from radiation and the severe weather, and may hold minerals, water, and ice the colonists could use for life support. \"They're a safe place on a dangerous planet, an ideal refuge for research,\" said Penelope Boston, lead investigator for \"The Caves of Mars,\" a series of experi- ments partly funded by the NASA Insti- tute for Advanced Concepts. \"Caves can serve as the foundation to advance our civilization on Mars,\" said Boston, who also is director of cave stud- ies at the New Mexico Institute of Min- ing and Technology. Boston and other researchers attend- ing the recent Mars Society convention are conducting experiments in caves on Earth to develop models for homes, farms and research labs on Mars. The project began with an experiment to see whether the air on Mars could be modified into something people can breathe. The Martian atmosphere is very thin, but has a higher concentration of argon than Earth. A mixture of oxygen, argon, and other gases was pumped into a container hold- ing two crickets. The insects didn't seem to be affected by the processed air. Similar tests were done on mice in a sealed cage, and the argon again did not appear to have any short-term health ef- fects. Still, scientists can't be sure until they try the test on humans. For a later experiment, scientists cre- ated a habitat for two mice in a volcanic lava tube in central Oregon-an environ- ment that resembles the caves research- ers expect to find on Mars. Trays filled with water were wedged between the walls of the mouse habitat. Two aquatic plants—duckweed and water fern-floated on top of the water like pieces of confetti. Fluorescent lights powered by a solar panel outside the cave pro- vided light for plant growth. The mice exhaled carbon dioxide, which the plants turned back into oxy- gen. After two days in the cave, the mice came out healthy, but short of breath be- cause the plants didn't produce enough oxygen, said Gus Frederick, one of the experiment's designers. A follow-up experiment, scheduled for this month, will include more plants and a mechanism to control humidity. The re- searchers may fill the mouse habitat with a gas mixture similar to the one Mars colo- nists would breathe, and in later trials the mice will eat duckweed. Frederick calls duckweed the ideal Martian food. The plant has more protein per gram than soybeans and can double its mass in a day. Although the mouse trials aren't fin- ished, researchers have designed a larger biosphere for humans that should be completed by November, made out of the same kind of plastic and nylon material used for hot air balloons, Boston said.

No need to duck and cover In a statement introducing the MUFON >/<?/<•/ Investigator 's Manual, Raymond E. Fowler said the following: \"...you as an investigator necessarily become an integral part of every UFO sighting personally investigated. It is you that compiles a report on the data extracted from UFO sighting witnesses. Your preju- dices, preconceived thoughts about UFOs; the responsibilities of family, ca- reer and other social pressures: and. your relationship with the witnesses are all apt to color your written report on any given UFO incident. \"You most be both dedicated and ob- jective, scrutinizing all available evidence in an honest effort to identify the reported flying object or phenomenon in terms of something known.\" Too often we see UFO sightings ex- plained through speculation, not objec- tivity. Some of the excellent investiga- tors are attacked for documenting their findings. The attacks may come in the form of speculation, not facts; disbelief, not objectivity: and personal attacks, not respectful interchanges. Often the Internet.becomes a tool in the hands of the culprits to influence opinions and garner support for these at- tacks. This is a sickness that needs to be recognized for what it is and should not deter the investigator from doing honest, high-quality work. MUFON Science Consultant Dr. Charles Lietzau summed the situation up pretty well in a recent email as follows: \"I've learned a lot from Patrick Swayze over the years. In 'Roadhouse,\" he was a traveling consultant (read as \"Samurai\"), who was hired to bring 'order' to out-of- control nightspots. His first word of ad- vice to the 'bouncer' crew was, 'Don't take anything personally.' \"We cannot be responsible for the speculation of others, whether sincere but uninformed, or motivated by something else. You cannot argue with speculation as it has no facts to prove or disprove, and invents new \"what ifs?\" faster than real science can research the old ones. \"Our research must stand on its own merits to be perceived by those who rec- ognize them. Therefore, we must include our research methodology, photographic proof, and, at least, the numerical aver- ages and statistical results. Soon, our reports will include scans of the actual nodes measured along with an included ruler for verification. \"At that point, our real critics will have the evidence before them and will have the means to prove us wrong. If we've covered all bases, that won't be possible. We've done our work, and done it well, and shown others the right way. When you rise up and take a stand, you become a target. The quality of your work be- comes your 'bullet-proof 'Pope-mobile.' No need to duck and cover.\" High-strangeness, high-credibility Many believe that the real break- throughs in UFO investigations will come from high-strangeness cases made by highly credible witnesses because they are willing and able to use their observa- tional expertise to describe the strange characteristics of such cases. Recently, a North Dakota sheri IT called me about an incident observed by him and his wife on July 10,2003. Before be- coming involved in law enforcement, the sheriff spent 14 years in high performance jet aircraft operations, and considers him- self thoroughly indoctrinated on aircraft characteristics. His involvement started when his wife called him from their back deck when she saw something unusual in the sky, as fol- lows: \"While she was looking up into the southeastern sky, she noticed a small for- mation of three or four stars. One of the stars shot straight down and stopped. A series of red lights came on and the ob- ject started moving in a northwest direc- tion. She yelled for me to get out there, and when I got outside I saw what I first believed to be an aircraft, except the red and white and green lights were in a ver- tical formation, not horizontal. I noticed that the speed of this object was relatively slow. 1 listened and heard a muffled sound much like a jet aircraft makes. \"The object got closer, and 1 estimated it to be about 1.000 feel in the air. It was just light enough to make out a silhou- ette. The object was longer from top to bottom that it was front to back. It had depth to it. and if I were to associate a shape to it, I would say it was diamond- shaped. \"The craft had two small lights on the front of it and two small red lights on the rear about in the center of it. When it got closer I noticed several windows that pro- jected light from inside the craft. There were three larger red and green lights run- ning vertically along the front edge of the craft. \"I was trying to pay attention to as many details as I could, and the one thing that stands out in my mind is that the speed was so slow, the muffled jet sound did not match, and the sound was further behind the craft. I also estimate this craft to be around 100 feet long and 200 feet high. It was moving too slow for its size.\" The craft left the area in a highly un- usual manner. He said: \"...the craft stopped, the red lights went out. the jet engine sound stopped, there was a soft white glow around the back of the craft, and the craft shot straight up and disap- peared.\" The point of my sharing a synopsis of this report in my message is to provide an illustrated answer to some of the ques- tions I have been receiving by telephone and email. Yes, UFOs are still being re- ported. The number of reports seems to be increasing. Some of the reports are strange indeed, making them difficult to investigate and suggest possible explanations. Highly trained people are seeing and reporting UFOs. Some of these people are report- ing highly unconventional flying objects. Public interest in UFO reports is still high, so this is a good time to get involved in UFO investigations. New Lifetime Member It is a pleasure to announce that Sheldon Gunnerson is MUFON's latest lifetime member. We are extremely grate- ful for this vote of confidence and out- standing level of support.
