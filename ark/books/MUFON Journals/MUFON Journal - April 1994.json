By Kent Jeffrey B ringing the Roswell case to light could repre- sent far more than the mere exposing of a gov- ernment cover-up or the creation of a major news story. It could represent one of the greatest revelations in the history of humankind â€” the knowledge that we, as intelligent life, are not alone. For this reason, if for no other, it should be pursued relentlessly until an absolute and definitive answer is obtained. My interest in the Roswell case stems in part from the fact that my father, a retired colonel and former air force pilot (and WWII fighter ace), at one time knew and worked with General William Blanchard, the man who issued the press release announcing that a \"crashed disk\" (UFO) had been recovered. In 1947, at the time of the Roswell incident, Blanchard was a colonel and the Commander of the 509th Bomb Group at Roswell Army Air Field. In the early sixties when my father knew and worked with him, he was a three-star general stationed at the Pentagon in Washington, D.C. In my father's opin- ion, General Blanchard was an extremely sharp indi- vidual who would never have made a fool of himself by issuing a press release announcing that the group under his command had recovered something as out of the ordinary as a crashed UFO without being absolutely certain he was correct. I have since had the opportunity to talk with others who knew and worked with General Blanchard and who share that same view. The fact that the military's official denial claimed that what Blanchard and his men misidentified as a crashed UFO was nothing other than a weather balloon strains credibility beyond limits. Generally, in contrast to the political environment of many other countries, when the United States military- puts out an official statement, we as Americans can feel assured we are being told the truth. While such confidence is not ill founded, there are exceptions. For example, because of the nature of his job, my father was once made aware of a \"cover story\" involving the crash of a top-secret aircraft in the early 1960s. Under the auspices of an intelligence agency, a press release was is- sued that was false. Cover stories exist. Former military witnesses have stated unequivocally that Blanchard's \"crashed disk\" press release on July 8, 1947, was true, and that the subsequent announcement denying it was a cover story. This would mean that the U.S. government has been in possession of the wreckage of an extraterrestrial craft for the last forty-seven years. The right of the American people to know of the exis- tence of such a craft and therefore of extraterrestrial intelligence is a social or philosophical issue, not one of national security. Suppression of such knowledge, in- cluding restricting individuals from testifying about it, would be a form of censorship and therefore contrary to the principles upon which a free and open society is founded. Researchers have located Roswell witnesses who, in fear of government reprisal, will not allow their testi- mony to be made public. In an effort to help get the Roswell matter into the open, a prestigious Washington, D.C., law firm has been retained to provide legal coun- sel to any witnesses (past or present) who have infor- mation on the Roswell event or on the subsequent dis- position of the wreckage, and who might consider going public with their testimony. As part of this effort, legal research has been done and attorneys from the firm have traveled to New Mexico and interviewed witnesses there. For legal and other reasons, government reprisal against Roswell witnesses who elected to go public would appear unlikely. For one thing, it would serve to validate their testimony and thereby make them instant heroes in the eyes of the public for having contributed to bringing down the most spectacular cover-up in his- tory. This is probably the reason no action was ever taken against Lieutenant Colonel Jesse Marcel, the for- mer intelligence officer of the 509th Bomb Group who went public with his account in 1978. Furthermore, accusing any Roswell witnesses of wrongdoing for speaking out and bringing the truth to the American people on this subject would be the height of hypocrisy on the part of the government. By doing so it would be tacitly admitting guilt in having deceived its own people. While billions of tax dollars have been spent over the last few decades on lunar, planetary, and deep space exploration, the American people have been kept in ignorance about Roswell and the existence of ex- traterrestrial intelligence. Many would consider such a blatant omission inexcusable. Perhaps this is why the cover-up continues. A s a result of a somewhat chance encounter in Europe a few months ago, 1 am now involved in an- other Roswell project, unrelated to the legal effort. It in- volves MUFON - CES (Mutual UFO Network - Central European Section), an invitation-only group consisting primarily of engineers, scientists, and university pro- fessors in the German-speaking countries of Western Europe. Knowing that I frequently travel to Europe be- cause of my work, MUFON'S international director Walt Andrus gave me the phone number of a MUFON - APRIL 1994 NUMBER 312 PAGE 3"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL CES member, Joachim Koch, who lives in Berlin and who is a practicing general surgeon there. I gave him a call and subsequently met him and another member of MUFON - CES, Hans-Jiirgen Kyborg, in the lobby of the Palace Hotel in Berlin. For over three hours we dis- cussed different aspects of the UFO phenomenon in Europe and in America. They had heard of the Roswell incident but said it wasn't widely known in Europe. They seemed interested in learning more about Roswell, so I left some material with them, including a couple of short papers I had written on the subject. A few weeks after our meeting, I received a letter from Messrs. Koch and Kyborg. In it they told how those in Europe were very much aware of how the for- mer communist governments in Eastern Europe had prevented their citizens from freely exchanging thoughts and ideas, sometimes by killing them, and how these governments continuously lied to the people. They had always thought that Western democratic governments did not act in such a way, but when they learned about the cover-ups concerning Roswell and the UFO phe- nomenon, they could now see how wrong they had been. They expressed the belief that knowledge concerning man's place in the universe with respect to other intelli- gent life was not a matter of any nation's national secu- rity, but rather a fundamental right of all humankind. They proposed that we work together and asked me to write a \"Roswell Declaration\" to be used in an interna- tional effort to pressure the U.S. government into lifting the secrecy surrounding UFOs and Roswell. T heir proposal is to work with UFO organizations throughout the world in a drive to get signatures, es- pecially from engineers and scientists, in support of the Roswell Declaration. On a yet-to-be-determined day later this year and under a well-orchestrated plan, the news media in different countries around the world will be notified and furnished with material about the Roswell incident in an effort to bring international at- tention to the case. They discussed the idea with Illobrand Von Ludwiger, a theoretical physicist and the director of MUFON - CES. The proposal was then pre- sented at the annual MUFON - CES conference last October in Austria, where it was well received by the at- tending members. In response to their request, I have written a five-page position paper, \"Time for the Truth About Roswell,\" which includes a detailed summary of the Roswell event, an analysis of media and government treatment of it, and arguments for allowing the public to know the truth. The \"Roswell Declaration\" is taken directly from that posi- tion paper and contains an appeal to the Administration for an Executive Order to declassify any U.S. Government information on UFOs or extraterrestrial intelligence. Polls have shown that over fifty percent of adult Americans believe in the reality of UFOs and extrater- restrial intelligence. Unfortunately, that interest has never been galvanized into a large-scale grassroots movement. This may now become a reality as a drive is currently underway to collect signatures for the \"Roswell Declaration\" from U.S. citizens. In addition to the Mutual UFO Network, both the J. Allen Hynek Center for UFO Studies and the Fund for UFO Research have, in a show of unity, agreed to participate in this effort. On the same day as the international effort to bring media attention to the Roswell case, a copy of the \"Roswell Declaration,\" along with a listing of the total number of signatories from each of the fifty states as well as from other countries, will be delivered to the of- fices of all members of Congress and to the White House. Also on that day, if finances permit, a copy of the \"Roswell Declaration\"will be placed in the first sec- tion of the national edition of a major U.S. newspaper. Since this will be primarily a word-of-mouth, grass- roots effort, your help in making copies of the declara- tion and distributing them to as many people as possible will be of great importance. The declaration and the position paper, \"Time for the Truth About Roswell,\" will also be made available on computer bulletin boards throughout the world. Although it is felt that there is a high probability the U.S. Government is withholding in- formation regarding the existence of extraterrestrial in- telligence, the primary goal is to get the matter into the open, so that the truth can be conclusively determined, one way or the other. It is hoped, therefore, that all in- dividuals, no matter what their opinion on the subject, will support this effort. In the event Congressman Steven Schiff of New Mexico is successful in his admirable effort to initiate a Congressional inquiry into the Roswell incident, a large number of signed \"Roswell Declarations\" from U.S. citizens would undoubtedly have a positive effect on that effort. Whether or not such an inquiry takes place, it is important not to become complacent. There are no guar- antees of success. An all-out effort should be made on all three fronts â€” Legislative, Judicial, and Executive â€” to put the greatest possible pressure on the government. We are engaged in a difficult endeavor, but one that is worthwhile, just, and possible to win. It concerns an is- sue about which most Americans would want to know and about which all Americans have a right to know.

It involved the recovery by the U.S. Military of material alleged to be of ex- traterrestrial origin. The event was announced by the Army Air Force on July 8, 1947 through a press release carried by newspapers throughout the country. It was subsequently denied by what is now believed to be a cover story claim- ing the material was nothing more than a weather balloon. It has remained veiled in government secrecy ever since. The press release announcing the unusual event was issued by the Commander of the 509th Bomb Group at Roswell Army Air Field, Colonel William Blanchard, who later went on to become a four-star general and Vice Chief of Staff of the United States Air Force. That the weather balloon story was a cover-up has been confirmed by in- dividuals directly involved, including the late General Thomas DuBose, who took the telephone call from Washington, D.C., ordering the cover-up. Numerous other credible military and civilian witnesses have testified that the original press release was correct and that the Roswell wreckage was of extraterrestrial origin. One such individual was Major Jesse Marcel, the Intelligence Officer of the 509th Bomb Group and one of the first military officers at the scene. On January 12, 1994, United States Congressman Steven Schiff of Albuquerque, New Mexico, announced to the press that he had been stonewalled by the Defense Department when requesting information on the 1947 Roswell event on behalf of constituents and witnesses. Indicating that he was seeking further investigation into the matter, Congressman Schiff called the Defense Department's lack of response \"astounding\" and concluded it was apparently \"another government cover-up.\" History has shown that unsubstantiated official assurances or denials by government are often meaningless. Nevertheless, there is a logical and straightforward way to ensure that the truth about Roswell will emerge: an Executive Order declassifying any information regarding the existence of UFOs or extraterrestrial intelligence. Because this is a unique issue of universal concern, such an action would be appropriate and warranted. To provide positive assurance for all potential witnesses, it would need to be clearly stated and written into law. Such a measure is essentially what presidential candidate Jimmy Carter promised and then failed to deliver to the American people eighteen years ago in 1976. If, as is officially claimed, no information on Roswell, UFOs, or extraterrestrial intelligence is being withheld, an Executive Order declassifying it would be a mere formality, as there would be nothing to disclose. The Order would, however, have the positive effect of setting the record straight once and for all. Years of controversy and suspicion would be ended, both in the eyes of the United States' own citizens and in the eyes of the world. If, on the other hand, the Roswell witnesses are telling the truth and information on extraterrestrial intelligence does exist, it is not something to which a privileged few in the United States Government should have exclusive rights. It is knowledge of profound importance to which all people throughout the world should have an inalienable right. Its release would unquestionably be universally acknowledged as an historic act of honesty and goodwill. / support the request, as outlined above, for an Executive Order declassifying any U.S. Government information regarding the existence of UFOs or extraterrestrial intelligence. Whether such information exists or whether it does not, I feel that the people of the world have a right to know the truth about this issue and that it is time to put an end to the controversy surrounding it.

Sensors designed to pick up one thing may well detect another. Could some \"others\" be UFOs? By Ronald S. Regehr T he United States' premier surveillance satellites, the Defense Support Program (DSP) series (also the oldest satellite series currently in the inven- tory), have detected unidentified flying objects. The U.S. Air Force, who owns and operates these satellites, continues to classify UFOs as \"valid IR sources,\" and various contracts have been let to further study this phenomenon. Are there any hard data to support these contentions? I believe there are. With the assistance of several as- trophysicists and lots of head scratching recalling my college advanced physics and mathematics, presented is proof of the DSP satellite's UFO detection capability. 1 (See sidebarâ€”ed.) Even though the DSP's primary mission has always been the detection of Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles (ICBMs), it proved its value during Operation Desert Storm by detecting the launch of every one of the 70 Iraqi Scud missiles launched, thus providing invaluable alert time to allow our allies and our troops to seek shelter and for the Patriot batteries to lock onto their tar- get. 2 Compared with an 1CBM, the Scud is a very low- intensity target, thus bolstering our premise that the DSP could detect UFOs. Armed with this mathematical proof of the DSP's UFO detection capability, Lee Graham, in his own enig- matic way, started a string of correspondence seeking to find if the DSP or any federal agency's satellites had de- tected UFOs. Freedom of information act (FOIA) re- quests to the North American Air Defense Command (NORAD), the presumed users of this type of satellite data, revealed that USAF units assigned to NORAD were exempt from the FOIA because of an interlocking treaty with Canada. Ostensibly, the law (5 U.S.C. 6552) provides a legal loophole through which all manner of data can fallâ€”including UFO data! Undeterred, Graham continued his quest. Some 200 (Two-hundredâ€”no, that is not a typo- graphical error!) FOIA requests and several years later, Lee has discovered some puzzling terminology used to describe some of the detected eventsâ€”the terms \"Slow Walker,\" \"Fast Walker,\" and \"Unidentified Object.\" Just as the term \"Slow Walker\" most likely does not denote the tortuously slow gait of a geriatric, arthritic perambulator, neither is the term \"Fast Walker\" likely to denote the ofttimes humorous gait of an Olympic speed walker. But what do these terms mean? Asteroids? Space Junk? UFOs? Repeated efforts have failed to reveal the true meanings of the terms, leaving speculation to those who gain comfort in that endeavor. Sky & Telescope, in their February 1994 issue, had an article \"Secret Impacts Revealed,\" in which they claimed that the DSP detects upwards of eight \"probable mete- oroids\" per year, but admit that this only accounts for about one-fourth of the actual \"events.\" Bill Moore, of MJ-12 fame, mentioned the term \"Fast Walker\" to Graham, who then inquired of Moore if \"Falcon\" (one of Moore's aviarian cohorts) had used the term. Moore confirmed Graham's suspicions, thus link- ing modern-day technology with the (in)famous MJ- 12. Joseph Stefula, former MUFON State Director from New Jersey, posits that \"Fast Walkers\" are incoming space objects and that the DSP detects on the order of 3 or 4 per month! Stefula's report to \"Mark\" 1 stated: \"I have information that at 1126Z, 5 May 1984, a DSP platform detected an object with heat in the 9,000 KW/SR range coming out of deep space and passing within 3 Km of the DSP. Its star tracking telescope first detected the object (Used to insure (sic) that the DSP is in the correct position by tracking the location of stars in relation to the platform). The observation lasted 9 min- utes. A detailed investigation failed to explain what caused the sensor reading, other than a real object of some type. Do these DSP systems have these capabili- ties? \"Fastwalker\" is the term used to identify objects that are being picked up on these and similar sensor systems in orbit. My source indicated that 2-3 times a month \"Fastwalkers\" are being detected. Without proof of some form of \"threat\", experts don't want to spend the money or resources to examine the phenomenon.\" S ubsequently, Stefula faxed what he claims to be a \"copy\" of this sighting, presented in Figure 1. Not too surprisingly, the enigmatic Phil Klass also figures into this satellite/UFO scenario. When Graham queried Klass regarding the DSP's capability of detecting intense IR sources on the ground, Klass's response was typically biased. Moreover it revealed another subject on which Klass is ignorantâ€”satellite surveillance technology. Instead of alluding to a theo- retical possibility (thus not revealing his ignorance), Klass proceeded to pontificate as to the shortcomings and limitations of the DSP (one of the most successful of all of our spy satellites), continued by presenting his unfounded hypothesis, and concluded by destroy- ing his hypothesis while hyping his book wherein he PAGE 6 NUMBER 31Z APRIL 1994"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL Intensity (KW/SR) 10,000- 10' claims to explain the 1976 Imperial Iranian AF sighting as the planet Jupiter. 4 M eanwhile, during this investigation, Ed Dames and his crew at PSI-TECH os- tensibly received a contract from the USAF Space Command, headquartered at Peterson AFB, Colorado, rumored \"home\" of the DSP, to ascertain if the DSP has spotted in- coming UFOs. Based on his \"remote view- ing\" of the DSP, Dames slated unequivo- cally that the DSP has, in fact, detected many UFOs originating in deep space and entering our (i.e.. Earth's) air space. Hence, one clue as to the USAF's reluctance to dis- cuss UFOs. The DSP's Sandia Bhangmeter (an optical burst detector) spotted what appeared to be intense flashes of light in the Earth's atmos- phere. They were believed to be meteors or asteroid fragments racing toward the planet's surface. On October 1, 1990, two DSP satellites recorded a burst of light over the western Pacific Ocean. \"Analysis carried out by Sandia National Laboratories in Albuquerque, New Mexico, showed that the fireball released the en- ergy equivalent of 500 tons of high explosives. Such an energy release could be caused by a 20,000 metric ton meteor, Sandia analysts concluded.\" 5 But could it not have been one of the UFOs Ed Dames \"spotted\"? But why would the U.S. Government (or any other government, for that matter) be concerned with detect- ing or tracking UFOs? One reason is that they could be confused with \"real\" threats. \"We believe that lack of information on the charac- teristics and influence of UFOs increase the threat of in- correct identification. Then, mass transition of UFOs along trajectories close to those of combat missiles could be regarded by computers as an attack.\" 6 At least once, a series of false alarms resembling a raid by Soviet bombers was detected, resulting in a SAC (Strategic Air Command) red alert (no pun in- tended). B-52 bombers loaded with nuclear weapons were poised for take-off when the \"targets\" disappeared. The launch was scrubbed, and nuclear war was avoided. The targets? Well, they were classified as \"radar reflec- tions off the Moon\"! Because of these and similar incidents, I believe that the Soviet Union, United States, Great Britain, and France all have conducted in-depth analyses of UFOs, if for no other reason than to provide a plausible explana- tion for unexplained phenomena that could result in their falsely initiating a world-ending nuclear raid. Curiously enough, this contention is bolstered by one cryptic sentence in the official USAF Policy Statement regarding UFOS... \"They (UFOs) have not proven to be a threat to the security of the United States of America.\" This statement has no validity unless UFOs have been FLIGHT 7 SIGHTING 5 MAY 84 1126Z ~lâ€”iâ€”iâ€”â€”iâ€”râ€”Iâ€”i ' i 'I i i 1 I Time, minutes 10 30 40 Figure 1 DSP SIGHTING OF 5 MAY 1984 analyzed, characterized, and cataloged into the identifi- cation data base of the nations' defense-network com- puters. SIDEBAR Various options and viewing/selection criteria lead to the design of a hypothetical \"perfect\" satellite for detecting UFOs. Applying these criteria leads us to examine the world's inventory of \"spy\" satellites, with the resulting conclusion that in addition to the United States, Great Britain, France, the (former) Soviet Union, Japan, and the People's Republic of China most likely have ex- ploited this capability as added insuranced of their coun- try's security and well being. None of these powerful na- tions wishes to trigger a nuclear holocaust; and none wishes to be the first to suffer from it either. This article details the physical characteristics of a \"typical UFO\" and the calculations involved in deter- mining whether or not this particular UFO could have been detected by existing satellite technology. Note that we're not discussing detection by some esoteric \"pie in the sky\" system, but real, existing satellite sensing sys- tems built with your tax dollars. The UFO that provides a basis for our mathematical model baffled the latest weapons in use in late 1976 7 . \"... These unidentified flying objects were described as bird like or as brightly lit helicopters although none were airborne at the time. Unable to convince the callers that they were only seeing stars, a senior officer went outside to see for himself. Observing an object in the north like a star, only larger and brighter, he immediately scrambled an Imperial Iranian Air Force (IIAF) F-4 to investigate. \"The F-4 pilot stated that the brilliant object was easily visible 70 miles away ... as the F-4 continued pursuit south of Teheran, a second brightly lit object (about 1/2 to 1/3 the size of the moon) detached from the APRIL 1994 NUMBER 312 PAGE 7"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL IR SUNSHADE BAFFLES CONDUCTION BAR ADVANCED RADEC I TR TELESCOPE PRIMARY MIRROR STAR SENSORS AND SUNSHADES IR TELESCOPE CORRECTOR LENS IR TELESCOPE RADIATOR PHASE CHANGE MATERIAL (PCM) CANISTER FORWARD FACING RADIATOR (FFR) ELECTRICAL ASSEMBLIES MOUNTING AREA FORWARD BASEPLATE AFT BASEPLATE OOH-2721 SED SENSOR PAGES NUMBER 312 APRIL 1994"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL original UFO and headed straight for the F-4 at a high rate of speed. The pilot attempted to fire an AIM-9 at the new object and was prevented by a sudden power loss in his weapons control panel. The UFO was described by both ground witnesses and the F-4 chase pilots as being about 30 feet in diameter and very bright. Its altitude ranged from ground level to 40,000 feet (12 Kilometers).\" There are several important facts we can glean from this article and use to narrow our spy satellite search. Most importantly, it was big and bright, was approxi- mately 30 feet (9.15 meters) in diameter, and radiated sufficient IR energy to enable the AIM-9 air-to-air mis- sile to obtain \"lock.\" Although the Sidewinder's sensi- tivity band is classified, its bandwidth of sensitivity ap- proximates that of other IR sensors. We can use these data to calculate the UFO's apparent brightness, compare this with the satellites' presumed sensitivities, and thus determine the UFO's detectability. I'll try to keep the mathematics and modeling assump- tions as simple as possible. MODELING ASSUMPTIONS\" 1. The UFO produces a layer of ionized gas (pri- marily nitrogen) surrounding itself. 2. The ionized gas is optically opaque with a black- body radiation temperature of 3000K (the minimum molecular ionization temperature of air below 12 km.) and is described as a Lambertian surface. 9 3. For simplicity, assume that the UFO is spherical in shape. The area of the UFO that is seen is effectively the top projected half, having an area of approximately 66 square meters. A = nR : = n X 75/F = n X 4.572 meters 2 = 65.7 meters 2 = 65.7x IO 1 centimeters 2 4. The UFO's emissivity is 1 (blackbody radiator). It could be lower, but the UFO description matches this emissivity. CALCULATIONS Using these, we can calculate the spectral radiant emittance (in watts/cm 2 (im) of the UFO using the fol- lowing formula (Planck's law of spectral radiation from a blackbody.): 10 -4 [1] ,5 he A â€” where: Â«*\"â€¢-! 10 \"\" = conversion constant = 10 \" 4 cm/dimeter h - Planck's constant = 6.6262 X 10 ~*watt sec 2 c = speed of light = 3.0 X 10\" meters/sec = 3 X 10 U) cm/sec k = Boltzmann's constant = 1.38 X \\Q' 23 watt sec/K T = blackbody temperature - 3000 K A. = center wavelength - 2.0 [imeters = 2 X \\Q~ 4 cm Inserting these values into the Equation, [1] the spec- tral radiant emitlance is calculated as W^ = 1.16 X I O 2 watts/cm 2 [imeter From this, we can calculate the UFO's spectral radi- ant intensity (watts/steradian meter) using the formula: A  [2] n and radiant intensity (watts/steradian) A W.A. E X X [3] where: /4 g = Area of emitting surface (65.7 X 10\"\" cw) X emissivity ( I) re = constant = 3.1416 A^ = Bandwidth (Dimeters) Inserting these values into Equation [3] results in an unattenuated (ground level) radiant intensity of about 2 X I O 7 watts/steradian. 10 Our next step is to convert this ground-level inten- sity to what the satellite would actually see. Because of the density and water vapor content of the atmos- phere, some of the ground-level radiant intensity is attenuated (or absorbed), thus not reaching the satel- lite. We need to multiply the ground-radiant intensity by the attenuation factor (transmission coefficient). We will assume there is no cloud cover (the article actually refers to a 'cloud-free night') and that the UFO is at an altitude of less than 12 kilometers. We will further assume that the satellite-to-UFO zenith (or viewing) angle is less than 30Â° (a worst-case condi- tion). For these conditions, if the UFO's altitude is 6 km, its apparent radiant intensity would be J a = 0.010 X 2 X 10 7 watts/steradian = 2.0 watts/steradian = 200 Kw/sr X 10 5 Continued on Page 18 APRIL 1994 NUMBER 312 PAGE. 9"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL SKYDANCER OVER ANTELOPE VALLEY A series of fall 1993 California sightings results in multiple witnesses and photographs. By Bill Hamilton O ne rarely reads in the annals of UFO reports of a continuing series of sightings involving the same UFO or its cousins. But apparently such a series has taken place over the Antelope Valley of California, home to many aerospace enterprises. It all began with a sighting made by an ex-Sheriff's deputy named Archie on June 8th. Fortunately, Archie kept a log of his sightings. As I and others started spot- ting the same daylight objects, we further extended the log. The sightings continued up through early November of 1993. Some of the entries made in our log will be pre- sented here to demonstrate something unusual is oc- curring on a regular basis high in our atmosphere, but is virtually ignored by the Air Force, and everyone else for that matter. Archie had his first sighting of the object he dubbed \"critter\" on June 8, 1993 at 1100 hours. He was sitting on the patio at his home in Rosamond, chatting with his lady friend, when she asked what kind of birds were cir- cling in the sky. Archie identified the birds as ravens, common to the area. Far beyond the ravens, though, was what appeared to be a dim daytime star. Both of them studied this apparent star with seven and ten- power binoculars. It appeared to be round and bright white, and sitting at a stationary point approximately 30 degrees from the horizon and southwest from Rosamond. They watched this mysterious object until 1230 hours when they viewed two slim silver objects fly from the vicinity of the primary object and make a high speed turn from north to west and disappear within a second. When attempts were made to locate the original object, it too had disappeared. On June 12, Archie spotted the object again from his place of work in Palmdale. Another witness also saw the object. After this second witness left, Archie ob- served the object move away at high speed. He saw it again on June 13, and again it was moving at very high speed. He made additional sightings on July 2nd and 3rd. On July 5th he watched the object sit still high in the sky for approximately 45 minutes. Then it moved slowly north. As Archie watched through binoculars, it seemed to accelerate steadily, wobbling as it moved, then suddenly stopped and hovered for a moment. Then it moved west and out of sight within seconds. It had appeared at 1 1 :45 a.m. and departed at 12:30. It reap- peared in the same spot of the sky at 1:15 p.m. On July 20, 1993 Archie spotted the object again at its usual location in the sky over Rosamond. This time he had his Minolta camera ready, mounted with a 300mm lens. When he took his first picture, the object seemed to discharge other objects and he continued snapping pic- tures at a setting of F8 and 125th of a second with the fo- cus on infinity. The object showed up as a bright spot against the sky. On July 22nd, Archie's observations convinced him that the object he was viewing was not a natural object and could fly away from its stationary position. Just as he raised his binoculars to watch the object, it began to move north at a steadily increasing speed, changing from white to beige and flattening in shape. It moved with incredible speed and without slowing, swung a \"U\" turn to the south and disappeared into the overcast. Archie stated that watching this object maneuver was like watching a fly or a bee. At this time Archie went back into the house to grab his camera. When he came back out. the object was back in position. Archie then snapped 18 pictures! Shades of Gulf Breeze! Multiple photos of a UFO. For some obscure reason this is cause for instant skep- ticism by the debunker crowd. One blurred photo is al- lowable. Perhaps we can arrive at no solid conclusions about one photo. Multiple authenticated photos are more difficult to deal with and the skeptics have to try harder. However, there are no rational reasons that an astute ob- server like Archie could not snap multiple photos of a UFO; moreover, he was not the only one to take photos of this object. O n the 25th of July, Archie equipped himself with a Tasco 75x astronomical telescope on a tripod to see if he could determine the mysterious object's shape, but the object appeared no larger than a pinhead, round, with a diagonal black line crossing through it. When he changed the eyepiece from a 2.5mm to a 4mm lens, he could not re-acquire the object. Usually an observer obtains subjective impressions about the target of observation, not just the objective data concerning the object's appearance and behavior. And usually these impressions are ignored by investi- gators. But 1 think they are worth mentioning in this case because of other reports Archie has made that indicate very strongly that he is also a CE-IV case and has been contacted or taken by entities associated with UFOs. According to Archie, the intelligence guiding this object seems to know when it is being observed as it appears to play a game of \"hyperspace hide and seek.\" The object possesses a high technology, apparent in its movements and its ability to place itself in alignment between the observer and the sun in some instances. Sometimes, when it takes off slowly, it appears to wobble.

That is when I nick- named the object Skydancer. tion in the sky indicates that it would have a clear sweeping view of all military establishments in Southern California, from Vandenburg in the north, to Edwards AFB, to the Navy station south of the Santa Cruz Islands. Archie thinks this object is a \"mother ship\" of unknown origin or a large unmanned probe. Because of its appearance and behavior he discounts explanations of it being a planet, balloon, satellite, or known aircraft. On August 9th, Archie spotted the object below the clouds and obtained four photos of it in various positions relative to the clouds. This object was also photographed from another perspective, at Fox Field near Palmdale, by another skywatcher who attends our UFORUM meet- ings. The other photographer usually uses 300-lOOOmm telephoto lenses and so obtained an excellent shot of this object in the clouds, but he has not given me a copy of the photo. Archie felt the object became spooked around 1220 and darted in and out of view. At 1225 hours, two fuzzy white elongated objects flew from the vicinity of the mam object's usual location. These fuzzy objects appeared roughly pointed and cigar-shaped. Archie kept describing a shape that reminded him of a parakeet seed. On August 13th I had the opportunity of sending my fiance, Pamela, to visit Archie and observe whatever he observed. She reported seeing the object, soon after noon, traveling from west to east. On August 14th Pam and I visited Archie and it was the first time that I had an opportunity to view the UFO that showed up as if on a train schedule. It was 1215 in the afternoon. Archie says he sees the critter through his binoculars. There is a crescent moon near zenith. He tells me where to point my 10x50 Bushnells, and moving my. aim one lens diameter west of the moon (which is about 80-85 degrees of elevation), I spot it. It's sitting sta- tionary and is sharp and clear under magnification. It ap- pears to be round and silvery, though I am sure it is also glowing faintly. After hovering for thirty minutes in one position, it begins to move rapidly and chaotically in tight S-curves and loops with the agility of an insect. That is when I nicknamed this object Skydancer. What appears to be a solid metallic object is moving with a to- tal disregard of inertia. Fascinating! Nothing in our in- ventory (that I know of) can move with such fantastic speed and agility. I could fully understand any motiva- tion to attempt a replication of the technology that can produce this type of performance in an aircraft or space- craft. We stopped viewing Skydancer at around 1300 hours. I took three photos with my Fuji camera at max- imum zoom (115mm) and one photo with my Chinon at maximum zoom (85mm). On August 21, two of my friends who travel to video- tape UFOs arrived at my home at around 11:30 a.m. Mike, who works for an aircraft company, brought his Sony 8mm videocam; Steve, who works for a cable ac- cess station, brought a Panasonic. We stationed our- selves at 30th Street and Avenue B. I spotted Skydancer at 12:05 p.m. drifting slowly east and then returning to a stationary position at an elevation of about 75 degrees and about 250 degrees azimuth. Steve and Mike had a hard time spotting it with binoculars. Mike finally got it in the viewfinder and started taping at 12x magnifica- tion. Mike helped Steve point his videocam and Steve started taping at 16x. Later, Mike accomplished the re- markable feat of taping Skydancer at 96x, aiming his camera at an extremely narrow field of view. Skydancer hovered in this position for over an hour. 1 also managed to see the object through my refracting telescope using a 20mm eyepiece (about 25x). Later, after viewing the hour of taping he had accomplished, Steve noticed that he had picked up a second object that was moving in a tumbling fashion past Skydancer. He digitally magnified this portion of the tape at the studio. So we now have video, still photos, and multiple eyewitnesses. It couldn't get much better, except for our elusive watcher to come closer for a better view. O n August 23rd, one of our local group members, Mario, called to report spotting a disk from the vicinity of his music shop in downtown Lancaster at K and I Oth Street West. He had two witnesses with him at the time of the sighting around mid-afternoon. The disk appeared at relatively low altitude (perhaps around 5000 feet?), tipped at an angle, and had a visible dome on its topside. It was bright as polished steel and moving er- ratically and silently. I have no way of knowing whether this disk was Skydancer or one of its associates. On August 28th 1 alerted another party, Drue, to watch for Skydancer. Archie was also watching for it. I first spotted Skydancer hovering at about 85 degrees el- evation and about 240 degrees southwest at 12:11 p.m. I phoned Drue to give him the location. When I went back to locate Skydancer again, it was in motion. It moved slowly at first, but seemingly without inertia. It traveled westward to about 35 degrees of elevation, then seemed to blur against the sky and disappear. Archie called, then Drue, who had seen something flit- ting about within the sun's bright glow. From time to time. Archie and I both noted that we could see dragon flies and other insects against the blue sky through binoculars and we could distinguish these from other high-flying metallic objects. When I went back out to look in the sunglow, 1 spotted an object that was Skydancer or its twin traversing south of the sun, trav- eling westward, then reversing direction and moving off southeast.

In the future, we hope to have full-length reviews of all of the following titles, but for now, just so you'll know they exist, we offer these thumb-nail sketches. Not all details were complete or available at press time, and the opinions expressed herein are those of the author only. One of the more controversial titles is sure to be Jim Schnabel's Dark While, subtitled \"Aliens, Abductions, and the UFO Obsession\" (Hamish Hamilton, London, 304 pages, Â£16.99). It hasn't found an American pub- lisher yet and isn't likely to, so if you want a copy you'll have to order it from Arcturus Books or some other similar source. Dark White is written in the same sort of vein as the author's earlier Round in Circles, i.e., part Gonzo journalism and part sociological study. Circles was roundly criticized by English cereologists because Schnabel himself was a confessed (and unre- pentant) circle hoaxer. Rumors that he was a covert government agent hellbent on discrediting the crop cir- cle phenomenon still continue to circulate in some English circles. Not a few American abduction researchers are al- most certain to feel the same way about Dark White, al- though there's no evidence that Schnabel ever tried to stage an abduction. What will probably be lost in the an- ticipated attacks against the author's journalistic ethics, though, is the fact that Dark White is a serious, far- ranging book that raises many questions about abduction \"mania\" that need addressing before they are summarily dismissed, regardless of Schnabel's previous reputa- tion. And regardless of whether or not one agrees with his final conclusions, many readers will find Schnabel's portraits of Budd Hopkins, David Jacobs, John Mack and others â€” perhaps even Philip Klass! â€” full of fas- cinating details that haven't been previously reported elsewhere. At the opposite end of the spectrum is the long- awaited opus by John Mack, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard's Cambridge Medical Hospital who was re- cently profiled in the Sunday New York Times Magazine (March 20, 1994). Mack's book is Abduction: Human Encounters With Aliens (Scribner's, approximately $20 and 450 pages), which is both more and less than it should be. Originally introduced to the abduction phe- nomenon by Budd Hopkins in January of 1990, Mack has since proven to be his own guiding light in such mat- ters, with repercussions that are likely to reverberate throughout the field. In brief, although he concurs that abductions are initially traumatic in nature, ultimately, he concludes, the experience is essentially an uplifting and transformative one, or at least that it can be. It's unfair to judge a book by one's prior expectations, but anyone who anticipated that Mack might put the phenomenon in its proper perspective in terms of the known psychological and psychiatric literature is apt to be disappointed. Instead, what we are treated to is a series of breathless abduction anecdotes, thirteen in all, accompanied by Mack's running commentary. If there was an attempt to thoroughly investigate or physically corroborate the testimony of even one of the 76 ab- ductees interviewed for this book, it sailed completely over this reader's head. The majority of Mack's \"evi- dence\" â€” virtually all of it recovered under his own ag- gressive brand of regressive hypnosis â€” is, for the most part, simply accepted at face value, even when it in- cludes tales told of past lives lived both as humans and as alien-human hybrids. Moreover, this is all eventually bound up with a po- litical, cultural and religious naivete that borders on the brink of New Age cliche. East is good and West is bad, almost as if the rape of Tibet by the Chinese had been orchestrated by a secret cabal of corporate capitalists and Genghis Khan was but a misunderstood do-gooder. Mack writes as if Western culture somehow had a patent on negative human nature, greed, ambition and other ex- cesses included. But not to worry: the aliens are here to save us from ourselves and impending ecological cata- strophe, themes first raised almost half a century ago by the so-called contactees of the late I940's and early 50's. If there's a critical or reflective bone in Mack's body, they're not much in evidence here. L inda Moulton Howe is back with another gorgeously produced book, Glimpses of Other Realities ( self- published, 365 pages, $39.95), subtitled \"Volume 1: Facts and Eyewitnesses,\" which indicates others to come. Unlike her first book, An Alien Harvest, this one is a paperback, but no less monumental in its presenta- tion, with a color plate on almost every other glossy page. This kind of production value doesn't come cheap, which explains the relatively high price tag. There are four extended sections devoted, in order, to crop circles, animal mutilations, abductions and other beings, along with appendices, a bibliography and index. Each section is fully documented and illustrated. What's missing, at first glance, is an over-arching theme or theory that would tie all of these disparate manifestations together in a coherent, convincing hypothesis. Are we to assume, for example, that the same celestial artist who carves out a Picasso-like pictogram in an English sum- mer wheat field is also responsible for, or even remotely connected with, the gruesome mutilation of cattle in rural Arkansas? To further complicate the problem, astronomer Gerald Hawkins of Stonehenge fame has recently claimed that PAGEi2 NUMBER 312 APRIL 1994"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL some crop circles reflect a musical, or diatonic scale. I must confess that such musicality is beyond me, and that I've yet to read an account, by Hawkins or anyone else, which conveys the slightest idea of what this is supposed to mean or not mean. If it's tied up with ratios, then are those ratios supposedly present in all crop circles? If not, then how do we know that they aren't simply an artifact of a particular circular or two with an arbitrarily ar- rived at diameter, that is, a product of randomness? Right now. it's the sort of \"factoid\" that a lot of people are feasting on without really having digested its caloric content. I admit it's intriguing, but does it mean we're supposed to find similar diatonic scales in UFO diame- ters, mutilated animal uteruses or in the heights of re- ported alien grays, reptilian, insectoid or otherwise? Interestingly, like Mack, Hawkins has also been associ- ated with Harvard University: but, so, too, has Timothy Leary. Close Extraterrestrial Encounters (\"Positive Experiences with Mysterious Visitors\") is another one of those books which I haven't had time to fully digest. It's authored by Richard Boylan, Ph. D., with help from Lee K. Boylan (Wild Flower Press, 202 pages, $12.95?), and appears to fall into the Leo Sprinkle/John Mack camp inasmuch as it reports friendly alien encounters or abductions. There are numerous statistical \"pie-charts\" reproduced here which need to be consolidated and compared with their counterparts elsewhere before com- ing to any final conclusions. Again, as far as my own personal discomfort is concerned, the internal investi- gation of such cases seems to rely almost wholly on tes- timony recovered under hypnosis. Karla Turner, Ph. D., author of Into the Fringe, has out a second book, Taken: Inside the Alien-Human Abduction Agenda (paper. $14.95), with a Foreward by Linda Howe, which I have not yet seen. Also unseen at this time is The Living Galaxy by Adolph Obach of Saskatoon. Canada. Also heard of but unread at press time is Watch the Skies! by Curtis Peebles, due out soon from the Smithsonian Institution Press. And to toot my own horn: the April, 1994 issue of Omni magazine carries the first excerpt of my continu- ing six-part series about UFOs. The Truth About the UFO Crash at Roswell by Kevin D. Randle and Donald R. Schmltt M. Evans & Co.. NY, 1994, hb, 251 pages, plus 16 pages of illustrations, $19.95. W e all know that the Roswell Incident has long legs, which is why, nearly 47 years after the fact, it's still around, alive and kicking. In fact, this is the sec- ond book on the subject by the same investigative team (Randle is a Captain in the Air Force Reserves, Schmitt director of special investigations for CUFOS), there is a Showtime movie based on same scheduled for release later this summer, and of course there is the ongoing in- vestigation called for by New Mexico congressman Steven Schiff, to be conducted by the Government Accounting Office. Now, it has even longer, or at least more, legs. Among the many new claims reported by Mssrs. Schmitt and Randle are a new date and location, along with new eyewitnesses discovered in the woodwork, including at least two accounts of an apparently living, breathing and walking alien retrieved from the crash site, where four other of its otherworldly companions allegedly died. The new date is shortly before midnight on Friday, July 4th, 1947, the location less than 40 miles north of the front gate of Roswell Army Air Field. Previous re- searchers had put the second site, where the bodies were allegedly found, within a few miles of the large de- bris field discovered on the Mac Brazel ranch, the one that resulted in the original press release written by Lt. Walter Haul, which first brought Roswell to the world's attention. (Or, in some cases, almost a hundred miles away, on the Plains of San Agustin, a proposition which the authors convincingly deflate. Still, a map, however crude, would have been helpful.) Brazel finds the scattered debris on the morning of July 5, according to the accepted scenario, goes into Roswell the following afternoon (Sunday), is accompa- nied back to the ranch that night by Major Jesse Marcel and Captain Sheridan Cavitt, the base's counterintelli- gence officer, and at noon Tuesday, July 8, Haul's press release goes out. Three to four hours later, in Fort Worth, Texas, the cover-up orchestration begins. Roswell, the Air Force contends, was nothing more than a misiden- tified weather balloon. There is much else new here, too, which explains why the authors felt compelled to do another book on the subject following their earlier UFO Crash at Roswell (Avon, 1991) And, in fact, there is too much new infor- mation to cover in a single review. Aside from that al- ready mentioned, there is a Lt. Governor of New Mexico, Joseph Montoya, testimony from two AP re- porters sent to Roswell, an alleged contemporary log book and diary page which confirm a UFO sighting on July 4 (neither is reproduced, however), and the identity of the rumored archaeologists. Unfortunately, there are also enough internal incon- sistencies and contradictions in much of this new mate- rial to keep legitimate critics and dedicated skeptics harping for years. Some of the internal inconsistencies are addressed by the authors, others aren't. No Roswell researcher that I know of. for example, has ever con- vincingly answered the first and most obvious Roswell contradiction â€” why the debris mentioned in Haul's original press release and the wreckage described in Marcel's account, only recovered 30 years later, are at such odds with one another? APRIL 1994 NUMBER 31 2 PAGE 13"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL I n Haul's account, presumably written after Marcel and Cavitt have returned to base and been debriefed, the flying disc is described as relatively intact and of such small size that the rancher (Brazel) reportedly hauled it into a shed for safekeeping. Yet one of the fun- damental arguments for the extraordinary nature of the debris field on the Brazel ranch has always been the fact that it was supposedly so extensive as to automatically rule out a weather balloon and most other mundane ex- planations. But, even now, a gigantic debris field with gouges in the ground visible from the air clashes with the descriptions of the second site as offered by the au- thors. In fact, there is even an illustration, drawn from al- leged eyewitness accounts by Schmitt. which shows a relatively intact, crescent-shaped object with a small gash or tear in one side. Are we to assume that all of the Brazel debris allegedly came from the missing section of an object which is nowhere described as more than 30 feet long or in diameter? That it only fell in one rela- tively concentrated area miles from where the object it- self came down with five aliens aboard, and wasn't subsequently scattered all across the intervening coun- tryside? Such a scenario might be possible â€” 1 just don't have a clear picture as to how. Randle and Schmitt also uncover much new testi- mony about what went on at the second site after the military arrived. According to one source, security was so tight that the MPs guarding the perimeter had to do so with their backs turned to the crash, and were routinely rotated every few hours so that no one got \"a good long look\" at what was going on. This is not unimaginable, of course, as a security precaution it simply clashes with lapses of security reported elsewhere. According to Truth, for example, members of the Roswell fire and po- lice department, even Chaves County Sheriff Wilcox. had been out to the second crash site, which makes little sense in light of the tight security measures imposed on the military's own troops. Who would have called them to the scene, and more importantly, why? According to Randle and Schmitt, one of the archaeology students alerted Wilcox, but the area should have been sealed off by the military long before any additional civilians were allowed into the area. A pparently, that same day, Saturday, July 5, the four dead bodies and one living alien are reportedly transferred to the base hospital; the latter is allegedly able to walk into the building under its own power, and is seen doing so by a civilian painter on the base. Why the latter would have been working on a weekend, let alone over the long national holiday of the Fourth, of which much is made elsewhere, isn't directly addressed. One might be forgiven for wondering, though, given the gravity of the situation â€” flying saucer and alien bodies en route! â€” why such incidental civilians weren't cleared off the base prior to the arrival of alien corpses. Some of those discrepancies are major, some minor. Some, no doubt, can be attributed to memories now more than 45 years old. They just can't all be right or accurate. At one point, the aliens are described as \"horrible,\" yet another drawing by Schmitt, based again on new eyewitness testimony, shows the aliens looking more hu- manlike (and taller) than ever. In one account, at least two of the bodies are described as horribly mangled; in another, they're all described as relatively intact. In one account, the autopsies take place at the hospital (as one would expect); in another, the bodies are seen laid out on \"mess tables,\" surrounded by doctors, in an airplane hangar before being transferred to the hospital. Does it make sense that ambulances containing bodies and at least one living alien would go first to a hangar, unload their cargo for examination, reload their cargo and then continue on to the hospital? One nurse, said to have participated in the autop- sies, is shipped out within a day or two, but no one else seems to have mysteriously disappeared that we know of. In one instance, we are told that the alien bodies are contained in a single, closely-guarded crate inside the hangar prior to being flown out aboard a B-29; in an- other, we're told that the bodies went out in two crates and two planes as a guard against losing the evidence in a crash. Where was the second crate? Some of these discrepancies are major, some minor. Some, no doubt, can be attributed to memories now more than 45 years old. They just can't all be right or ac- curate. And the authors admit as much in their chapter devoted to the accounts of the two AP reporters they were diligently able to trace and interview for the first time, Jason Kellahin and Robin Adair. Their stories roughly hang together, but vary as to specific time, se- quence and certain other details. I don't mean in any way to disparage the immense amount of time and energy that Randle and Schmitt have put into their investigation of the Roswell Incident (the book is well recommended for reading), only to point out that all of the answers haven't as yet been uncovered, as I think they would be the first to agree. Nor do 1 mean to cast doubt on their newly discovered witnesses. The wrinkle in the new Roswell scenario that bothers me most, though, is this one. According to Randle and Schmitt, Blanchard. Wilcox and numerous other known and unnown participants were all at or near the \"second\" crash site, with bodies, on the day before Brazel drove into Roswell on Sunday and reported what he had found. (Conspicuous by their absence, however, are Marcell and Cavitt, both intelligence officers, who are later sent out to investigate Brazel's \"second-rate\" site.) Why, then, since base commander Blanchard presumably already knew about the crashed saucer and recovered alien bod- PAGE 14 NUMBER 312 APRIL 1994"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL ies, would he even remotely contemplate authorizing a press release three days later about the now insignificant Brazel debris field? Surely he would already have been in contact with his superiors in Washington and the se- curity lid clamped down hours, if not an entire day, be- fore Brazel ever drove into town? Arguably, higher-ups might already have been in town and running things. Moreover, the Brazel debris field involved but a handful of witnesses, and would have been relatively easy to whitewash or cover over at the outset had anyone desired to do so. But the second site, which Randle and Schmitt now say is the first site, allegedly involved lit- erally hundreds of civilian and military witnesses. The more the merrier, perhaps, but also the much harder to corral and control. If Blanchard truly knew and kept mum about Saturday's events, what earthly urge would have compelled him to publicize the Brazel incident? It sim- ply doesn't make sense. P art of the \"appeal\" of Haut's original press release has always been its partial understandability as an all-too-human snafu which had to be hastily covered over with a weather balloon story. But the revised Roswell scenario makes no sense whatsoever, if an alien craft and bodies were already in Army Air Force hands. It changes Blanchard's once forgivable gaffe from a mere overeager slip of the tongue into a monu- mental foul-up of potential career-suicide proportions, an act of such sheer stupidity, if not actual insurbordination, as to be almost unimaginable. Yet, as is known, Blanchard went on to a distinguished service career and was even in line for the job of Air Force Chief of Staff before he died from a heart attack. Haut and Marcel, meanwhile, retired from the service within a year and three years, respectively, which in no way means to cast aspersions on the character of either. But to reiterate: what Randle and Schmitt appear to be implying here is that the cover-up was already well un- derway as early as the afternoon of Saturday, July 5th. Troops had cordoned off the area, the bodies were al- ready on base, numerous eyewitnesses already threat- ened, and at least one flight with extraterrestrial artifacts onboard was being readied for cross-country transport, with a second soon to follow, all in apparent secrecy. In other words, the military authorities were already well in the know. That Blanchard, on his own initiative and under such circumstances, would now authorize a press release the following Tuesday â€” almost three full days later â€” regarding the Brazel debris field literally stag- gers the imagination. It is so improbable a develop- ment as to be almost inconceivable by definition. So where does this leave us dedicated Roswell watch- ers? Partly in anticipation that the ongoing GAO in- vestigation will finally tie up the many loose ends and inconsistencies of the case once and for all. Ultimately, however it may also leave room for yet another book on the Roswell Incident. May 1994 Bright Planets (Evening Sky): Venus (magnitude -3.9) shines conspicuously in the WNW at dusk, not setting until well after twilight ends. This brightest of all planets lies near the thin lunar crescent on the 12th. Jupiter (-2.5), still retrograding in Libra toward Virgo, is low in the SE at dusk and advances westward across the southern sky during the night. The giant lies near the gibbous Moon on ihe night of May 22-23. Bright Planets (Morning Sky): Mars (1.2), in Pisces, is hard to see as it is low in the E al dawn. Jupiter sets in the W about 4:45 AM daylight time in mid- month. Saturn (1.1), in Aquarius, rises in the E about 2:30 AM in mid-May and remains low in (he ESE at dawn. Annular Solar Eclipse: On Tuesday, May 10, the new moon crosses in front of the Sun but is too far away (near apogee) to completely hide the bright solar disc. Thus, a ring or annulus of sunlight en- circles the black silhouette of the Moon. In the U.S. the 145- mile-wide (varies somewhat) path of annularity sweeps from SW to NE across parts of 15 states â€” Arizona. New Mexico. Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas. Missouri. Illinois. Indiana. Ohio, Pennsylvania. New York, Massachusetts, Vermont, New Hampshire, and Maine. The annular or ring phase of the eclipse exceeds 6 minutes along the center line of the path from Oklahoma to Maine. The Moon covers about 94% of the Sun's diameter and obscures about 89% of the Sun's area throughout the annularity path in (he U.S. The rest ot\" (he country experiences a partial eclipse in varying degrees de- pending upon the distance from the central umbral path.

Unlike the total phase of (he total eclipse, this particular event at maximum still leaves 11% of the Sun's brilliant photosphere exposed.

Just to have an unusual scar, to have seen a strange light, or to dream about aliens does not necessarily mean anything. There are emotions, reactions, and other aspects to be considered as part of these reported experiences. Patterns are developing, however, from thorough investigations. Although no list of symptoms is guaranteed to be com- plete or necessarily accurate, consider the following as- pects: (1) Observation of an unidentified flying object or un- usual light source. This would include lights which il- luminate an entire area such as a field, bedroom, or car interior. Also included are moving balls of light (red, or- ange, yellow, or white) from the size of golf balls to beach balls, commonly seen outside and inside homes, navigating with a sense of purpose. There are cases from California to Puerto Rico which suggest that some of these intruding lights transform into the unexpected visitors. (2) Unexplained period of amnesia or \"missing time\" â€” sometimes shared with other participants. No medical explanation has ever been offered for this kind of shared amnesia which begins and ends simultaneously for as many as four people. (3) Sudden onset of insomnia, irritability, anxiety, or fatigue without any known precipitant. A lapse of time may have occurred but perhaps was not realized or rec- ognized as relevant until much later. (4) Vivid dreams with unusual content â€” not neces- sarily about UFO's or aliens â€” that may include odd faces, places, procedures, and feelings. For example, a woman has recurring nightmares about large white ants examining her on a large toadstool in a dentist's office. Despite the absurdity and lack of any obvious connec- tion to her everyday life, she feels terrified. (5) Sudden unexplained appearance of peculiar \"scoop marks,\" precise incisions, needlemarks, punc- tures, or geometrically-shaped bruises. Subject usually minimizes or ignores these initially. Rapid healing may also occur. (6) A driven or nagging feeling that \"something has happened\" to them that cannot easily be ignored or for- gotten even after 15-20 years. (7) Unexplained dislocation in physical space: go to bed, wake up standing in a nearby field; driving a car â€” next moment car is parked in a pasture and subject is in another field: wake up in wrong bedrooms or beds, etc. (8) Emotional reactions to objects in the environ- ment â€” even to a hypersensitive or phobic level. One subject developed an intense fear of dolls. Other fears have been of hockey masks, flashing lights, owls, people wearing dark sunglasses, and triangular-shaped signs. (9) Avoidance of places in the environment that trig- ger anxiety for no obvious reason. A person may drive completely out of his way daily to avoid a certain stretch of road. A child may refuse to play in his back yard or to sleep in his own bed any longer. (10) Persistent doodling of odd images that make no sense consciously. Keeping some of those peculiar doo- dles for as long as 20 years. (11) Unexplained bleeding from nose, ear, punctures, or rectum. This tends to have more relevance if occur- ring in conjunction with an unusual dream or period of missing time. (12) Hearing one's own name called clearly â€” per- haps awakening the subject â€” and feeling compelled to get up, walk outside, or drive somewhere. Feeling mon- itored and uneasy about looking upward. (13) Nocturnal sensations: (more significant if cor- related with an odd dream, sudden scar, or unusual light) awareness of floating over the bed, a feeling of be- ing pulled out of bed, a sudden need to fall sound asleep (despite any excitement or activity happening) or a sud- den awakening â€” \"as if someone flipped a switch\" â€” and finding oneself sitting or standing wide awake â€” sometimes simultaneously with others. (14) \"Screen memories\": unlikely images of white an- imals in unlikely locations â€” a deer in the kitchen, a four-foot chipmunk at end of bed, a bobcat nose-to- nose with subject in bed, or a four-foot white owl stop- ping one's car. (15) Apparent psychic ability â€” not necessarily de- sired or appreciated â€” but many interesting incidents are evident. This seems more correlated with subjects having life-long UFO experiences. (16) Poltergeist-like activity: rapping/banging on walls, doors closing, objects flying, other objects dis- appearing and re-appearing later in surprising places. Some of this may be the result of developed but unreal- ized psychokinetic ability. (17) Occurrence of sounds in one's head just prior to an abduction: buzzing, whooshing, Morse Code beeps, clicks, musical tones or a vibrational tone as if from \"a tuning fork in my head.\" (18) Unusual electrical effects (apparently occurring just after a suspected encounter): shorting out ovens, mi- crowaves, dishwashers, computers, televisions, and even streetlights (when passing underneath). One subject \"whited out\" a piece of Kirlian Photography film with her hand. (19) Subjects frequently have little or no interest or knowledge regarding UFO's or aliens.

In doing so he threw off the stranglehold of Aristotelian astronomy and opened the window on the brave new world of modern science. The villains of the piece are the high- ranking churchmen whom he invited to look through his telescope to see for themselves that the heavenly bodies were not perfect. But they refused to even look. Of course, we know better today; thank God for modern science. Or do we? Why did the prelates not look? Was it really just a matter of stubborn adherence to an antiquated philosophy? Proof positive of a closed mind? From the point of view of the cardinals you might see things differently. First, the crude telescopes of the day were well known to have deceiving optical arti- facts... aberrations well-known to astronomers today. So you couldn't really trust your eyes when looking through a telescope. More importantly, the churchmen had a worldview, which said that the laws of nature and optics, which applied here on Earth were funda- mentally different than the laws of physics and optics in the celestial realm above the atmosphere. Thus, in the minds of the churchmen there were excellent reasons to profoundly distrust the appearance of any celestial object as viewed through Galileo's telescope. The cardinals were not simply being thick-headed and closed-minded; they were being prudent and rational in the context of the prevailing worldview. Who are the Galileos and who are the churchmen of today? Every scientist would probably claim that he or she is following in the footsteps of Galileo. But a strong case can be made that, at least regarding anomalies such as UFOs, the scientist of today is following the no- ble tradition of the seventeenth century cardinals. As sci- entists we are taught to think and mutually encouraged to believe that only certain theories and conceptions of reality are possible and that there is no point in opening ourselves to error by looking in that murky, borderline regime where only deception lies. In 1981 a maverick group of scientists and scholars, of remarkably diverse academic backgrounds, came to the conclusion that there was a need for a new initiative in scientific research. They identified phenomena that were being ignored by the scientific community even though they were potentially interesting and perhaps of fundamental importance. The Society for Scientific Exploration (SSE) was formed and its first meeting fit- tingly took place at the National Academy of Sciences in Washington on January 5, 1982. Interestingly the lead- ership of the society consisted mainly of (and still is to some extent) astronomers. The founder and long time president of the SSE is Prof. Peter Sturrock, a solar as- tronomer at Stanford University. Being a research-ori- ented society, SSE originally had a small number of professional members, but has recently opened its doors to anyone supporting the goals of the society as associ- ates. The primary means for accomplishing scientific research is through a research journal. A new kind of scientific journal was needed that would be open to any topic but rigorous in its scholarly criteria. Thus, in 1987 the SSE created the international Journal of Scientific Exploration (JSE) as the official publication of the society. During the first five years, JSE was published by Pergamon Press and appeared twice per year. Beginning in 1992, JSE embarked on an ambi- tious program to expand in size and readership as an independent publication of the society. It now appears quarterly and has a worldwide audience that has increased nearly threefold in the past two years and continues to grow steadily. D r. Bernhard Haisch has been editor of JSE since 1988. He considers that the primary goal of the society and the journal is to provide a professional forum for presentations, criticism and debate concerning topics such as UFOs which are for various reasons ignored or studied inadequately within mainstream science. A sec- ondary goal is to promote improved understanding of those factors that unnecessarily limit the scope of sci- entific inquiry, such as sociological constraints, restric- tive world views, hidden theoretical assumptions, and the temptation to convert prevailing theory into pre- vailing dogma. The Society encourages such investiga- tions for several reasons that may appeal to different communities: (1) To the research scientist, the intellec- tual challenge of explaining away an apparent anomaly or seizing the new knowledge presented by a real one; (2) To the student scientist, that science begins with the unknown and ends with textbooks; (3) To the non- scientist, the deep public interest in some of these topics calls for unprejudiced evaluation based on objective re- search; and (4) To the policy-maker, today's anomaly may become tomorrow's technology.

STRINGFILLD RECOVERING One of the most well-known investigators of crash/re- trieval cases is recovering from surgery at his home nearCincinatti, Ohio. The last week of February, Leonard Stringfield entered the hospital to undergo an operation that removed two growths from his left lung. The opera- tion was successful, and a biopsy revealed the growths to be benign. Len was reported to be weak, but doing well overall. An operation on his right lung is scheduled as soon as he is sufficiently recovered. Despite his illness of the last few months, Len was still able to complete his last book and get it back from the printer before the end of February. Its title is UFO Crash/Retrievals: Search for Proof in a Hall of Mirrors, Staus Report VII, and is available directly from the au- thor for $16.50, which includes postage and handling. You can write Mr. Stringfield at 4412 Grove Avenue, Cincinatti. Ohio 45227. Please join MUFON and his many friends in wishing Mr. Stringfield a speedy recovery. ABDUCTION NOTES - Continued from Page 16 to rationalize and minimize their unusual experiences â€” sometimes to an irrational or absurd extent. (20) Subjects have been found in both clinical inter- views and through psychological testing to typically not possess any problems of a psychological nature that could serve as a source for their experiences. Subjects usually dread publicity, fear ridicule, and hesitate to tell anyone. These twenty aspects give a researcher a good idea of what kinds of data to expect and watch for in abduction research. Not all aspects will be part of each subject's world, but a researcher needs to know what could arise in any investigation.

He wrongly assumed that the scientific team responsible for the satellite's design chose a bandwidth that would not see through the atmosphere. They chose this bandwidth, he erroneously continued, to ensure against detecting jet aircraft plumes, thus precluding the possibility of de- tecting Soviet bombers which would provide false data, leading US air defense forces to assume that an attack was being launched. 5. \"Sandia Scientists Intrigued by Flashes in Atmosphere,\" Space News, December 7-13, 1992, page 15. 6. \"UFOs and Security,\" Soviet Military Review, No. 6, June 1989.

APRIL 1994"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL Letters to Mufon UFO Journal WHAT MUFON CAN DO TO CHANGE THE PUBLIC'S PERCEPTION OF UFOLOGY: ONE MAN'S OPINION By Chris W. Brethwaite, M.L.A. To say that ufology has an image problem, is to say that the Titanic had a leak. But unlike the crew of that ill-fated vessel, we can avert a similar metaphoric fate. With over 4800 members, we have the means to sway public opinion in our favor. However, if we're going to turn ufology into a legitimate subject, one that is just as likely to be discussed in the mainstream press as it currently is in the supermarket tabloids, then we're going to have to do things differently than they've been done in the past. Every month a dozen or so new consultants and research specialists join the ranks of MUFON. These people have the brains to go head to head with the toughest of skeptics and hold their own. if not come out on top. Unfortunately, most of them are forced to stand on the sidelines and assume a passive role because \"the guys down at the trailer court.\" along with a coterie of New Age charlatans, have taken cen- ter stage with their wild stories, histrionics, and unsubstantiated claims. We need to cut these yahoos off at the pass before they can do any further damage. The way to do this is to elevate ourselves in the eyes of the public, and the best way to accomplish this is to enact a policy change requiring that all future vacancies for the positions of State Director and Assistant State Director be filled by members possess- ing a graduate degree, preferably one in science or technology. This in addition to requiring that all newly appointed Section Directors and Field Investigators possess a baccalaureate degree or higher. Virtually every major corporation in the United Slates requires its professional .staff to have a college education. If we are truly a scientific organization, and not just a group of UFO buffs paying lip service to science, then it's high time we adopted this policy for ourselves. After all, we are trying to understand a tran- sient and complicated phenomenon, one that is not easily studied or investigated. Consequently, we need the most intelligent and best educated people we can find for the job. One of the main benefits of a college education is that it teaches a person to think in a critical fashion. It is this ability that is sorely lacking in many of the people I meet at UFO study groups and UFO conventions. These true believers who think that every anomalous light in the sky is another invading spacecraft, and every bad dream another alien abduction, are public enemy number one. The best way to negate their impact on the public's perception of ufology is for our state and local directors to cultivate working relationships with members of the news media. We need to be as diligent in seeking out re- porters as \"the guys down at the trailer court\" have been, if not more so. The main reason they get so much press in the first place is that they actively seek it out. Another reason is that their fanciful stories make for a good read. But so do timely, well researched UFO sight- ings that contain verifiable facts and are of interest to the local citizenry. The bottom line is that we have to give reporters who have been assigned to do a UFO story an option to interviewing the first crazoid they come in contact with. The next thing we, and for that matter, the rest of ufology needs to do, is to erase the blackboard and start over with the proverbial clean sheet of paper. We need to take the absolutely, positively best data from the past forty-seven years and symbolically pitch the rest. Then we need to set the criteria for accepted evidence much higher than it has been and proceed from there. Consequently, mystery documents and videotapes that arrive anonymously in the mail should no longer be given credence until it can be determined who sent them, and that that person is a credible source. UFO re- searchers who publicize materials of unknown origin risk embarrassing all of us and make themselves likely targets for future hoaxers. Also, sensational cases, such as the Linda Cortile case, where none of the witnesses are willing to make their identities known, would also not be publicized. These cases only add to the contro- versy and do little, if anything, to further our cause or to enhance our image in the eyes of the public. F ollowing that, we then need to steal a page from zoologists and start spending more time out in the field looking for our elusive prey. No matter how thor- ough your investigation is, there is only so much data you can obtain after the fact. By having groups of trained professionals stationed out in the field with video cameras and some basic scientific equipment, it'd only be a matter of time before we amassed some excellent data. Anyone who doubts the benefits of field research should read Dr. Harley Rutledge's book, Project Identification: The First Scientific Field Study of UFO Phenomena, to see what a gold mine of hard data can be had from sky watching, especially during a flap. We also need to change the way we go about inves- tigating sightings. Too many field investigators ap- proach a case and merely look for data that favors an anomalous explanation. Besides being scientifically un- ethical, this kind of \"research\" plays right into the hands of CSICOP. They want us to screw up so they can em- barrass us and further erode what little credibility we APRIL 1994 NUMBER 312 PAGE 19"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL have left with the public. Isn't it bad enough they're holding a gun to our heads? Must we also give them the ammunition to put in it? The best way to silence CSICOP is to to take an ag- nostic position towards every case we investigate and maintain that position until every fact, good, bad or in- different, has been collected, double checked and thor- oughly analyzed. If at that point in time we cannot come up with a prosaic explanation that reasonably ac- counts for what reportedly transpired, then and only then can we declare it an unknown and add it to our list of evidence. We cannot afford to make investigatory mistakes that will come back and haunt us later on. If we can take the wind out of CSICOP sails, we'll be doing ourselves a tremendous favor. Another thing hampering our efforts is money. Since a cake sale isn't very practical, I propose doubling the membership fee to $50.00, with half the money being earmarked for investment in a mutual fund portfolio or similar investment. This fund could be managed by an MBA or investment banker within our ranks. A per- centage of the interest generated from this fund could be used to pay for independent analysis of UFO photos, polygraph examinations, soil sample testing etc. Perhaps if we had enough money, we could assemble some kind of UFO Delta Team that we could dispatch to a UFO hot spot on a moment's notice. Finally, the last thing we need to do is recognize the fact that we have to walk before we can run. Let's con- centrate on obtaining that right front fender of a UFO and put all the other speculative issues on the back burner. It's only natural to wonder about where they come from, how long they've been coming here, and what do they want with us, in addition to pondering the rumors of underground alien bases and reverse en- gineering of saucers, but let's not waste time pontificat- ing on these issues until we have some reliable means to ascertain what the answers are. Conjecture and specu- lation only makes separating the wheat from the chaff a harder job than it already is. I don't claim to have all the answers and maybe some of my suggestions will lose out in the market- place of free ideas. However, I am convinced that if we want to make some real headway into establishing the validity of UFOs, in addition to changing the public's perception of ufology, then we're going to have to try some new tactics and ideas, because we're forty-seven years down the road, and in all honesty, we know little more now than we did on Tuesday afternoon, June 24, 1947.

On September 7th, Archie reports seeing two Skydancers, a boomerang, and dumbbell-shape that hovered. On September 9th, my neighbor Vicki reports seeing a formation of gold-gray objects flipping at dif- ferent angles in the northern sky at low elevation at around 2:15 p. m. D uring many sightings of Skydancer, I would spot it hovering motionlessly at a very high altitude. Sometimes it seemed silvery, other times, white. Another viewer asked me if it could be a planet or a very bright star that could be seen in daylight. Of course, I replied that it wasn't a planet or very bright star as only novas have been seen in daylight sky. The brightest, nearest planet is Venus and Venus was seen rising in the early morning hours before the sun. All the planets travel along the plane of the ecliptic and progress at roughly a degree of arc every four minutes. Skydancer did not progress westward with the sun, but maintained its orig- inal position for as long as an hour. Another speculation is that of a balloon. Balloons are at the mercy of high-ve- locity, high-altitude winds and could not maintain the same position as long as Skydancer. Other aircraft and conventional artifacts are ruled out when Skydancer goes into motion and accelerates at high speeds without gradually gaining speed, or executes swift turns that would place severe G-stresses on its structure. When all datapoints of observation are taken into account, the evaluation is that Skydancer is a UFO and exhibits clas- sic UFO behavior. On September 18th Archie observed Skydancer a few degrees from the sun. It was stationary at first then began to drift to the east. By this time the object was so consistent in its schedule that Archie recorded observa- tions for September 28th and 29th, and again on October 1st, 4th, 7th, 18th, and 22nd. Most of these appearances occurred between 1200 hours and 1250. On several of these occasions Archie reports that the object did its \"bee's dance.\" Skydancer has not been seen since November 1993, but we wonder if it will return to the skies in the summer of 1994. It is difficult to escape speculation on the pur- pose of Skydancer's visits over the Southern California desert on a repetitive schedule. It seems like something of interest was monitored, perhaps on a daily basis, but I doubt if we will ever know what that something was. Recently, I have heard two reports of the silent dark triangles traversing the twilight skies over the valley. The mysterious UFOs will not go away, but neither are they making themselves any less of a mystery. Bill Hamilton is the Chief Investigator for MUFON-Los Angeles.

The distinguished recipient will be presented with an en- graved plaque and monetary award of $500 from MU- FON. Ballots were enclosed with the February 1994 issue of the Journal for your convenience and vote. The candidates are Edith Fiore (CA), John Ford (NY), Stanton Friedman (NB, Canada), Cynthia Hind (Zimbabwe, Africa), Budd Hopkins (NY), Linda M. Howe (PA), Pat Marcattilo (NJ), Dennis Stacy (TX), Leonard Stringfield (OH), Doris Upchurch (TX), and Donald M. Ware (FL). Please remove the orange ballot from the February 1994 Journal, vote for the candidate of your choice, sign and date the ballot, and return by mail to: MUFON, 103 Oldtowne Road, Seguin, Texas 78155. U.S.A. before May 1, 1994. If MUFON is to continue this annual award, it is imperative that a significant number of our total membership actively vote. As of March 26, 1994, 604 ballots had been received in Seguin, TX, with many more anticipated from foreign countries. It is very evident that an enclosed ballot is far more effective in eliciting votes than a postcard re- sponse, when only 160 were submitted. If you have not voted, please do so now, so that we may have a signifi- cant response for this prestigious honor. FIELD INVESTIGATOR'S MANUAL OUT OF PRINT The third edition of the MUFON Field Investigator's Manual is temporarily out-of-print. It has been removed from the MUFON Publications List. Work is progressing very well on publishing an expanded version to be iden- tified as the fourth edition in the near future. Please do not delay conducting Field Investigator training classes due to the absence of the fourth edition. Some sections or chapters of the present manual are only being up- dated, whereas new sections on abduction investiga- tions, animal mutilations, crop circles and polygraph will be new. Explicit instructions on completing Form 1 and Form 2 will also be new. An expanded section on in- terviewing witnesses by Dan Wright will be an asset to the new manual. The availability date and price will be announced in the Journal. Please do not back order the new manual, since it will be doubled in size and the price has not been determined from the printer. We are excited about the fourth edition, since it will be a state-of-the-art publica- tion.
