Fortunately, they were good ones. Within the last three or four years MUFON membership has essentially tripled, to well over 3000 subscribers worldwide, making us, as far as I know, the world's largest UFO organization by far. Certainly we are the only one presently publishing a 24-page journal on a monthly basis. Which brings me to my subject: the Journal itself and my tenure as editor of same. My name first appeared on the masthead some seven years ago, in the summer or fall of 1984. We weren't a bad journal then, but we certainly weren't a great one, either. I don't mean to disparage any of my predecessors by such a remark, only to reflect the then current state of affairs. Our cover stock was a pale, legal-pad yellow, and each issue consisted of 20 pages, the contents of which varied widely in quality. Well, things have changed. The journal you hold in your hands today has a slick, glossy cover and consists of 24 pages devoted exclusively to text and photographs. Monthly col- umns include Bob Cribble's \"Looking Back\" and Walter Webb's \"Night Sky.\" On a somewhat more irregular basis we also carry Lou Parish's \"In Others' Words,\" a bi- monthly round-up of the UFO literature, and \"Current Case Log,\" a summary of recent reports. The latter was initiated by Dan Wright and is now being compiled by Donald Ware. Each of these features serves a particular public service function, hopefully making our readers among the most well-informed in the field. We also carry a calendar of cur- rent events, focusing on upcoming con- ferences, and tend to publicize the ac- tivities and publications of both the Fund for UFO Research and the Center for UFO Studies, space permitting. The ~^~~~~~^^~' \"Director's Message,\" by Walt Andrus, keeps readers and members informed of our own activities. To further up- date subscribers I initiated both \"The UFO Press\" and \"News'N'Views\" sections, which also appear at fairly regular intervals. The \"Letters\" column is a way of allow- ing our individual voices to be heard. The meat of the matter is made up by various feature ar- ticles and in-depth reports. Our flexibility is such that, on occasion, we have resorted to adding four extra pages when required or dictated by the material on hand. If I paint a rosy picture of the Journal's present status and overall progress, it's because I think the picture is basically an accurate one. Is it a perfect picture? No, not by any means, and the reasons why are several, some of which have to do with the nature of ufology itself, some of which have to do with human nature and personal politics. To address ufology first, THE EDITOR'S PAGE let me simply say that if I've erred in emphasizing some aspects or ap- proaches over others in this vastly elephantine and complex field, then I've tried to err on the side of con- servatism for what I hope are obvious reasons. However much we might wish otherwise, it remains a truism: after 45 years of UFO investigations, rumor and speculation are still much easier to come by than verifiable physical evidence. Even the immense document trail we've man- aged to uncover in the last decade or so under the Freedom of Information Act is evidence only of the documents themselves — not the physical phenomenon we all believe, is hiding somewhere behind the paper shroud of secrecy. M LET'S FOLLOW THE FACTS, WHEREVER THEY LEAD any MUFON members are quite within their right to ask, so what? We know that UFOs exist, that the government is engaged in an ongoing, active cover-up of their existence, why beat around the bush? Because allegations, affirmations and even affidavits are not UFOs. Neither are ground traces or photographs. Col- lectively, they all represent our best argument. But in a definitive scientific sense, only UFOs are UFOs. And if our objective is a truly scientific one, then it is our obliga- tion to continue to collate and quantify our \"best shot.\" No matter what we might think or believe, without a physical UFO in hand, the subject of our study remains just that: an Unidentified Hying Object, final nature, motive and intention unknown. This is not just my personal opinion, but a limitation imposed by the phenomenon itself. My apologies if I offend anyone by pointing out this foremost fundamental and most primordial fact. The available evidence supports any number of interpretations and hypotheses, often dependent on one's pre-existing belief systems and world view. As I understand it, however, MUFON's purpose is not to arbitrate or ^~^~~^^~^ adjudicate among individual beliefs, but to follow facts wherever they lead. In speculation we abound; it's the fundamental facts we so sorely lack. So what about human nature? As the membership roll continues to grow, I despair of being able to satisfy or ac- commodate everyone's viewpoint. This lack of \"agree- ability,\" if you will, is as much a product of the sheer numbers involved as anything. I certainly am not trying to impose my own personal beliefs on anyone else. In fact, I try to maintain an open door and mind as part and parcel of my basic editorial policy. To that end, I've always thought that a basic give-and- take was fundamental to the phenomenon, that controver- sy was an inevitable and integral ingredient of any scien- tific discussion. But it's also come to my attention that this is an incredibly fine line to draw.

Carpenter, MSW Abstract The independent interviewing and hypnotic regression of multiple witnesses to a UFO close encounter are essential steps toward establishing a credible account with minimal op- portunity for contamination, suggestion, or influential interac- tions. The separate hypnotic investigation of two or more par- ticipants greatly decreases the likelihood that imagination, delusion, or confabulation serve as explanations for these encounters. On November 7, 1989 two middle-aged women were driv- ing in a remote area of western Kansas when they encountered a UFO and then lost two hours of time. They experienced anxiety, insomnia, irritability, and bewilderment as a result of that night. Neither woman had any knowledge or interest in UFOs at all. They never believed that they ever left their car or observed anything further. Hypnotic regression (ob- tained independently) revealed abduction scenarios with at least 40 direct correlations between their accounts. Many cor- relations were found with both published and unpublished research data. A few interesting differences in the abduction data suggest a consideration of the effects of personality and perception. The Witnesses \"Susan\" is a 42-year-old businesswoman (happily married to an engineer) with two children, ages 17 and 21. She and her husband live in a beautiful home in a peaceful suburb of St. Louis. She had never given the subject of UFOs any attention and has not read any books on the subject. In fact, she stated she had never even heard of Betty and Barney Hill or ever read a science fiction novel. She is an honest, respect- ful, caring, strong, dependable, and candid woman with no psychological problems or history of such difficulties. She will look you directly in the eyes and state sincerely what she feels, needs or thinks. She is a level-headed, open-minded person who seeks the truth with a calm but inquisitive persistence. \"Jennifer\" is a 49-year-old widow with two grown step- children, ages 33 and 35. A college graduate with a MSW degree, she works as a free-lance photographer in one of several business pursuits in the St. Louis area. She is somewhat shy and reserved but yet independent and adven- turesome. She has not read any books or seen any movies concerning the subject of UFOs. She seeks truth and understanding and admits she first needs an education in the field of UFOs. She is perceptive in noting small details and will keep thorough little journals at times. It was one of these logs that became a significant record of \"missing time.\" The Sighting Event On November 6, 1989, these two women were on the road, pleasantly driving home to St. Louis from a conference in Aspen, Colorado. Jennifer was faithfully documenting her log and had just noted that it was 11:35 p.m. as they pulled out of a gas station in Flagler, Colorado. They had decided that they would drive to Goodland, Kansas before stopping for the night. Susan had been averaging 75-80 mph on In- terstate #70; Goodland was 72 miles away. Shortly after leaving Flagler, they caught sight of a bright object ahead of them in the east and slightly to the south but very high in the sky. They noted that it was fairly stationary but always stayed in the same location in relation to their car despite noting that the moon changed position in relation to their car and the object. They clearly observed flashing col- ored lights on the object and occasional little movements. Then they both noted the rather sudden appearance of many smaller green lights near the brighter UFO. While Susan drove, Jennifer kept her eye on the skies for nearly an hour. Several times they pulled off the road briefly and dimmed all their lights so that they both could get a bet- ter view. During the last time they did this, Susan noted the car clock indicated that the time was 12:40 a.m. Suddenly they both saw a ball of light descend to within a hundred feet of their vehicle, hovering over a field ahead and to their right. Below this ball of light appeared a V-shaped \"cone\" of soft, \"fluffy,\" white light reaching toward the ground with colored rays of pastel pink, blue and lavender. These beams seemed to establish the edges of the \"cone\" and criss-cross slightly at the bottom point. The women performed a \"reality check\" at this point by verbalizing to each other what they were seeing, and they reported the same visual details. They also both noted \"black waves\" through the lower portions of the windshields — reminiscent of heat waves on the horizon of a desert highway. They felt the excitement and rush of adrenalin only to next remember that they were pulling back onto the road and feel- ing strikingly different. Now they felt similar feelings of ex- haustion, irritability, and a preference for silence and solitude — quite an amazing and sudden transition in a matter of what seemed to be only seconds in time! They stopped at a rest area only to find the restrooms closed, but they noted they could still see the bright object. When Carpenter is MUFON's Director for Abduction Research. His last appearance in these pages was with \"Gerald Anderson: Fact vs. Fiction,\" which appeared in the September 1991 issue of the Journal. MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 283 November 1991"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"SUSAN WAS SHOCKED AT HOW SHE LOOKED IN THE MIRROR: \"LIKE DEATH WARMED OVER.\"  __ they drove on, they arrived in Goodland, Kansas just minutes later, which indicates that their closest encounter with the cone of light was just outside of their desired destination. This correlates with Susan noting that they had traveled approx- imately an hour at the time of their last pause to see the ob- ject more clearly. They also noted distinct changes in inten- sity in the lights around the motel as they arrived. Susan noted the time and Jennifer documented their arrival in her log at 2:30 a.m. After they settled into their motel room, they noted startling changes in their physical appearance that matched their irritable feelings and fatigue. Jennifer had very red, flushed cheeks which for her is quite unusual, given her com- plexion. Susan was shocked at how devoid of color she ap- peared in the mirror — \"like death warmed over.\" At breakfast the next morning they asked the waitress about any UFO sightings in the area and were informed of some near Wichita. The Missing Time Puzzle As they prepared to leave the next morning, Susan knew they would certainly need gas as Jennifer had indicated that they had traveled until 2:30 a.m. — nearly 3 hours exactly. However, she was surprised to find that the gas gauge indicated only about an hour's worth of gas had been used. Confused, Susan asked Jennifer to check the mileage on the map. She then learned that they had only traveled 72 miles in that three- hour period of time. There is a time zone change approx- imately 13 miles further east from Goodland, but they had not entered that zone yet. They were not mistaken about the time because they remember the front desk clerk being rather surprised at how early in the morning these two women were traveling. Still puzzled when they arrived home in St. Louis, Missouri, Susan had her husband study a map to help solve their puzzling loss of time. He concurred that it had only been 72 miles. They then noted a fresh black streak on the outside of the driver's sun visor and also near the sun roof on the inside of the car. By this time both Susan and Jennifer noted how irritable, jumpy, anxious and restless they continued to feel. Jennifer reported not sleeping well for many nights. Both experienced problems with nosebleeds. Because of the UFO sighting and Susan's determination to resolve the missing time experience, she located a friend familiar with the UFO field. He then referred her through channels to Bruce Widaman, Missouri MUFON State Director, who then alerted me. Susan was requesting help — possibly through hypnosis — to learn more about what happened to them. Hypnotic Method Both subjects were placed into a hypnotic trance state by means of deep relaxation techniques. This begins with physical relaxation of all body muscles (like a \"mental massage\") and continues with the introduction of vivid imagery of the sub- ject's choosing which involves all the senses. This \"peaceful, safe and secure\" place becomes a positive and reassuring set of images to which the subject can retreat if necessary dur- ing the session. This then allows the subject a sense of trust and control as well as the realization that hypnosis can be a positive and wonderful experience already. Confirmation of these feelings and this level of trance is achieved through ideomotor responding — the barely perceptible twitch of a finger in response to my verbal question. The subject then is asked to drift through time and space and to begin recalling the details of a particular conscious memory. As certain details come easily into focus, others are sought by triggering all the senses — including colors, move- ment, little sounds, fragrances, temperature, texture and so forth. Remembering additional detail can often trigger fur- ther recall of other scenes or activities, sometimes belong- ing to another time. , With abduction experiences an attempt is made to suggest believable reponses to the subject to see if opposition will occur instead of following my lead. When the subject resists the suggestions and presents data which is not only unsolicited and unusual but also correlating with other abduction research data, this would offer credibility to the reality of their recalled experience. It seems significant when a subject survives countless subtle, but trick questions without difficulty. The hypnotic process continues with the focus on extensive detail and working through any emotional moments. The subject is reinforced with positive remarks and brought gently back from the hypnotic trance. Time distortion will normally oc- cur with this level of work. Summary of Sessions Just one week after this encounter, I began interviewing these two women. I had each provide drawings and tape- recorded independently their conscious recollections. Both swore that they never left their car and had no prior knowledge, interest, or belief in UFOs. I placed Susan under hypnosis first. To her own amazement Susan sees her car shrink beneath her as she floats silently upward toward the bright craft in the night sky. She next finds herself in a circular room en- circled by geometrically-shaped windows and panels and lit by a diffuse pinkish-white light. She sees slender, non- muscular, 5 1/2 foot-tall beings with large hairless heads and tiny pointed chins. They have huge, slanted, non-blinking, dark eyes which seem to communicate with her telepathically. They have white skin and no apparent clothes as they glide about gracefully. She notes not much of a nose and no real use of a barely-perceptible mouth. Four long, slender, flexi- ble fingers are seen on each hand. Susan is calmed by one touching her head while she watches Jennifer laying on a narrow table, fully-clothed and undergoing some sort of exam.

Amazingly, this triggers a memory of an encounter just two weeks earlier when Susan recalled herself laying on a table with the same creatures around her, placing a small, flat, tissue-like object up her nose with a similar dental pick-type instrument (Susan remembered having the worst nosebleed of her life afterwards during her garage sale). In the present encounter, Susan recalls receiving clear telepathic messages about \"genetic coding,\" \"mutual advance- ment of both races,\" and a \"telepathic link\" with Earthlings. Although very certain about these \"messages\" under hyp- nosis, Susan was amazed later to hear herself say these things on the audiotape copy of the session. She also remembers see- ing Japanese-like \"hieroglyphics\" on the wall of the room. In a second session later, she recalled more about how the beings approached the car, instructed her to turn it off, and then floated them out of their seats. This may explain how a grease mark appeared on a sun visor — perhaps from a shoe brushing it. Susan fully understood and appreciated the im- portance of not revealing any information whatsoever to Jennifer. Jennifer's session likewise found her also floating upward away from the car and into the night sky toward a bright \"frisbee-shaped\" craft. Once inside, she, too, reports a cir- cular room lit by a diffuse, reddish, orange-white light and en- circled by geometrically-shaped windows and panels. Jennifer not only sees the 5 1/2 foot tall, slender, non-muscular being with an oversized hairless head and \"chalk-white face\" which glided about effortlessly, but also some creatures with suction cup fingertips wearing hoods. All beings were recalled as having the large, black, teardrop-shaped eyes which taper around the sides of the head. She likewise notes hardly any nose or mouth. Four long white fingers were seen on each hand. Jennifer also remembers seeing a long corridor, an auditorium with tiers of seats, and a floating platform with a railing. She then remembers laying on a table, fully-clothed, under a bright light while some kind of exam takes place. She remembers not being able to see Susan at this point — just like Susan suspected! She remembers being calmed by an alien hand and losing track of time. She has no clear memory of communication but did receive some vague impressions of a scientific purpose involving \"body chemistry.\" Shortly after this encounter, Jennifer experienced a series of troubling nosebleeds. Drawings were also made independently after each session while recollections were fresh. Although their recall was not exactly identical, the overlap of their details yielded over 40 correlations. The remaining details produced correlations with the data from other cases and other researchers. Post-Session Responses Both women were amazed at what they had recalled in- dependently under hypnosis. Both were relieved and excited over having seen similar things. But they were also puzzled AT LEAST 40 CORRELATIONS COULD BE FOUND AMONG DESCRIPTIONS OF THE CREATURES, CRAFT INTERIOR AND THEIR BEHAVIOR.       ' over having a few differences in their recall. I explained that memory is dependent upon one's direction of focus, percep- tion and attentiveness to detail. The nature of one's person- ality may also be a factor in terms of what one is drawn to focus upon. Jennifer — the photographer who compulsively keeps track of little details (as in her log) — reported many more details visually than did Susan. On the other hand, Susan, who is more assertive, articulate, social and communicative, has clear and distinct recall of communications with the be- ings whereas Jennifer seems more vague and uncertain about this. Each seemed drawn to notice and remember things toward which their attention naturally focused. Anxieties disappeared; restlessness and insomnia also seemed to magically vanish. This is consistent with die kind of relief many people feel when repressed information and emotions are released. Jennifer reported, \"After many nights of not sleeping well, I slept like a baby the first few nights (after the session).\" Susan's determination to recover the missing time now becomes a determination to share the truth of what happened to her with others. She does not want or need attention but will share her story with those who will listen seriously. At my request one year after her encounter, she summarized her feelings for a large gathering: UFOs were not in my consciousness. It's not that I was a complete skeptic, it's just that it was nothing that ever interested me. I wasn't into UFOs! And since I've had the experience, I've had so many people say to me that they wished it had happened to them — and my response is, \"Then why did it happen to me?\" I was never in- terested in it. I never read a book. It's like a year ago I had tunnel vision. It's almost like I lived in a little box. So when people are skeptical of the UFO phenomenon, I understand! I was there! I know exactly where they're coming from. But it is a type of tunnel vision. It might actually cause you to break out of your pre-conceived ideas about who we are and where we're going and what we're all about if you allow for anything other than what you can see, touch and feel on this planet. I can honestly say that what happened to me was a positive experience. And I can say that, because I have grown from it. I think that I am a much better person for having had my little world shattered — and for opening up to new possibilities of what this life might be all about. Summary and Discussion This case is significant in that two mature, highly-credible women — unfamiliar with any UFO-related data — clearly observed a UFO approach to within 100 feet of their car. MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 283 November 1991"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"Neither woman could consciously account for nearly two hours of time. Both adamantly claimed independently that they never left their car or saw anything else. Separate hypnosis sessions unblocked their amnesia and produced many similar details of an abduction aboard an alien craft. At least 40 correlations could be found among descriptions of the creatures, craft in- terior, behaviors, procedures and general scenario. Not only did details match each other between their accounts but other details echoed both published and unpublished research data. No evidence or motivation for a hoax can be found. Both women responded with appropriate emotional relief and amaze- ment at recovering the repressed material. I t is highly unlikely that fantasy, confabulation, or a sug- gestive influence could account for the detailed accuracy of their accounts. How could these women — ignorant of UFO stories and research — both recite little details that other abductees have only revealed in private sessions which have never been published? If this were a hoax, then their accounts would have been more exactly alike. (The correlations with unpublished data dismiss this notion anyway.) Some differences in their report suggest more credibility as one would expect some differences to naturally occur due to: • the selection of focus of their attention due to personal inclination • natural little imperfections with recall • differences in perspective while aboard craft • differences due to individual activity If they were attempting to duplicate published UFO accounts, then one would imagine that they would both recall the be- ings at their commonly-reported height of 4 - 4 1/2 feet tall — and that Jennifer would have been unclothed while lying on the table. Nevertheless, both women reported these details similarly despite the deviation from more publicized accounts. Beyond all these considerations is the psychological process of their emotions — from irritability and sleeplessness, to sincere amazement, to general relief and personal growth. These women are of fine character and now find themselves sharing a bizarre reality with many other participants in the UFO enigma.

As System Ad- ministrator I highly recommend this form of electronic communication as a way for individual members and groups to keep in touch with one another between Journals. The requirements are really quite simple: • Use a modem which is \"Hayes\" compatible. • Communications settings should be 8 bit, no parity, 1 stop bit (8-N-l). • Your communications program should provide \"ANSI\" terminal emulation. • The monitor you are using should provide 80-column display. r J • Modem baud rate must be a minimum of 300 baud; 1200 is acceptable, but 2400 baud would be ideal. For those members who feel communication by com- puter might be too technical, not to fear. With the array of communications programs currently available, connect- ing with a BBS over a telephone line is not nearly as com- plicated as it once was. Those members interested in ac- cessing this type of communications media should write to me at the address below, and I'll be happy to forward an \"On-Line Guide\" which explains what is involved and the information available. Or log on to the data number shown and leave me a message. We are constantly seeking information concerning UFO and related topics. I would like to request each State Direc- tor to please include me on their mailing list for local newsletters and any articles in which they think other members may be interested.

MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 283 November 1991"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"\"MISSING FETUS\" CASE SOLVED By Ann Druffel O n the 28th of June 1991, an event unique in the UFO field to date occurred when full medical documenta- tion, including a personal interview with the physi- cian involved, was obtained in what seemed to be a genuine \"missing fetus\" situation. The case amounts to a possible breakthrough in the UFO research field; Ann Druffel and Georgeanne Cifarelli researched the case together. A \"missing fetus\" case, as the term is currently in use, can be defined as a report by a UFO close encounter witness either pregnant at the time or who becomes pregnant shortly after a suspected UFO abduction — who claims that the fetus later mysteriously disappears from the womb. Numerous such reports have surfaced in recent years, and have sparked the interest of some researchers, begin- ning with a \"missing fetus\" described in Budd Hopkins' book, Intruders. 1 Speculation as to the cause of these reports range from 1) the possibility that UFO entities are actually taking human fetuses; 2) the possibility that the fetuses them- selves were human-alien hybrids, recovered by the entities; or 3) some other unknown effect resulting from UFO close encounters. The difficulty of obtaining documentation /verification of such cases became a source of frustration to physicians like Richard M. Neal, Jr., M.D. 2 and other researchers who have tried diligently to confirm various witnesses' statements by obtaining medical documentation/physician verification. As intriguing as these reports are to researchers, and as tragic as they are to the witnesses who report them, certification and proof of the events have eluded the field. Researchers who have tried and failed to obtain such documentation over the past three or four years surmise that at least two elements prevent it: that doctors involved in such cases might be reluctant to talk about them, because of the strangeness of the situations or because they might fear be- ing sued for malpractice; or that the witnesses are reluctant to ask for confirmation because of embarrassment or fear of offending their physicians by asking for verification. Enter Morgana Van Klausen, a female witness who resides in Southern California, who had repeated UFO entity ex- periences from December 1987 through May 1991. The case is exceedingly complex, with rich detail, but the witness herself is a wholly rational, productive individual. Briefly, the events include: 1) a bright beam of light which was seen to move around outside the home, followed by a time lapse of about 2 and 1/2 hours in December 1987, involving herself and four-year-old son; 2) invasion of her home by a short, white-skinned entity who awakened her from sleep and reportedly performed some type of invasive gynecological procedure in January 1988; 3) the discovery by the Van DEATH OR DISAPPEARANCE OF A FETUS? Klausens of a 13-foot diameter circle of burned grass in their backyard the day after the appearance of the intrusive creature 3 ; 4) two unidentified \"persons\" who entered the home during the night, and were perceived by Mr. Van Klausen who felt totally paralyzed and incapable of confronting them; 5) their four-year-old son's perception of \"white figures\" who entered his bedroom and also looked through the windows, leaving him with conscious memories of \"trips on spacecraft\"; 6) a visit by two short entities who were perceived by Morgana as they leaned over her son's bed; and 7) a visit by a similar type entity in May 1991, whom Morgana succeeded in pushing away, after which the creature abruptly disappeared. Shortly after the second visitation, the witness began to feel what she described as \"an unexplained desire\" to have another baby — this in spite of the fact that the couple had agreed that, because of their ages, they would limit their family to one child. In late January 1989, she unexpectedly became pregnant. On February 28, 1989, her obstetrician, Dr. Levine 4 , a physician in good standing at a large Southern California hospital, performed an ultrasound scan of the developing fetus. She remembers Dr. Levine reassuring her on this date that \"everything was fine.\" One month later, on March 24, 1989, Dr. Levine did a se- cond ultrasound scan. This time, he told Margana he could not detect any cardiovascular activity in the fetus and sent her for a consultation with a perinatologist, Dr. Holland. 5 This specialist had more powerful equipment and performed ?. scan with a vaginal transducer. Morgana recalls that Dr. Holland told her that \"the fetus had grown to about six or seven weeks and then had died.\" Dr. Levine performed a D & C on that afternoon, March 24, 1989, which was Good Friday. Mr. Van Klausen accom- panied his wife to the hospital, and she was taken by a hospital volunteer up to the second floor to await surgery. The floor was deserted, due to the fact that no elective surgery had been scheduled for the Easter holiday and, as she later learned, she should not have been taken there, but instead taken directly to the surgical floor. Left alone in a private room in the isolated ward, Morgana felt depressed and afraid. Presently a small- statured person whom Morgana assumed was a nurse, entered the room. This person spoke a few sympathetic words to her and patted her head.

Morgana was disquieted by the woman's appearance. She had bony arms and hands, with long fingers; her features likewise were pointed and sharp. Her manner of dress was odd; she wore a pinafore instead of a regulation nurse's uniform. When Mr. Van Klausen re-joined his wife for a while, the \"nurse\" did not speak or look at him directly. She averted her head deliberately, immediately left the room and did not return as long as he was there. Morgana was not given any presurgery medication, as she should have been, and this had to be administered in surgery, instead. Mr. Van Klausen had had trouble finding out where his wife was, and even Dr. Levine assumed she had been taken to the fifth floor. The appearance of the nurse was so strange to both Mr. and Mrs. Van Klausen that they attempted in every way they could to track down the nurse on duty that day, but the hospital couldn't pro- duce any record of her. Dr. Levine had planned to perform the surgical procedure by suction; the hospital had two new machines of the latest type for this purpose. Mrs. Van Klausen was under general anesthetic, but learned later from her husband and doctor that both machines failed to function, and the surgery had to be performed by hand, using the older D & C method (dilation and curettage). MORGANA REMEMBERS DR. LEVINE SAYING \"IT WAS SOMETHING HE COULDN'T EXPLAIN.\" W hile still in the recovery room, Morgana asked her doctor what sex the child had been. Dr. Levine seemed unwilling to talk and told her that he would answer all her questions at an office visit, set for two weeks later. At this office visit, Dr. Levine told her about the suc- tion machines failing to function, and Morgana speculated that perhaps it was \"her energy\" which had caused this, ex- plaining that she had been greatly disturbed over the loss of the baby and perhaps had psychokinetically affected the machines. Dr. Levine replied that he did not believe in \"psychic things.\" His reaction caused Morgana to be doubly glad she had not told Dr. Levine about her experiences with the strange entities which had intruded into her house. Dr. Levine then showed her the pathologist's report. In referring to the material recovered by the D & C, it read, \"Decidua chorionic villi, no fetal parts.\" The phrase \"decidua chorionic villi,\" Dr. Levine interpreted, meant that it was a confirmed pregnancy. Morgana was puzzled about the phrase, \"no fetal parts,\" because she had not bled suffi- ciently to pass the fetus spontaneously before surgery, and both doctors had referred to \"the fetus\" who had died. Morgana remembers Dr. Levine saying that \"it was something he couldn't explain.\" Morgana tried to talk more in depth with Dr. Levine but, in her opinion, he evaded her questions. He advised her to forget about this pregnancy, and if she wished to have another child, to \"try again.\" Although he and his wife were on a friendly basis with the Van Klausens, often socializing with them, he told her that he would prefer to withdraw from close social contact for a while. She got the impression that he was very disturbed and mystified by the incident, and that he did not wish to be pressured into discussing it further. Because of her close encounters, Morgana had, early in 1988, contacted Budd Hopkins and was referred by him to Cheryl Fernandez, D.C., and Dr. Richard Neal, both of Los Angeles, who were interested in the complexities of her case. The writer was called in later, originally to investigate the burned circle. Morgana joined a local abductee support group and succeeded in overcoming her trauma caused by the early encounters. By the time her 1989 pregnancy terminated in what seemed, to her, a totally mysterious fashion, she had read several books on the subject and was aware of other \"abductees\" who had reported \"missing fetuses.\" Logically, she wondered if this might be what had happened to her. As stated above, she had no conscious memory of any encounter with bedroom entities occurr- ing at or around the time she became pregnant in January 1989. However, since the entity visits had been monthly from December 1987 through May 1988, with one exception, and afterwards a series of unusual psychokinetic events — typical poltergeist manifestations — had occurred in the home, she wondered if perhaps an entity encounter might have occurred of which she was not consciously aware. Added to this was the strange little \"nurse\" who had attended her prior to the D & C. She began to wonder if it could have been an entity disguised as a nurse, who might have removed the fetus. It is to Morgana Van Klausen's credit that she recognized the necessity of proving that a \"missing fetus\" situation had actually occured. She began a time-consuming process of col- lecting medical documentation to verify it. In the spring of 1991, she obtained a copy of the pathologist's report and per- suaded Dr. Levine to write a report for her, describing the incident. Later, she obtained a copy of the perinatologist's report. To our knowledge, this is the first time complete documentation has been obtained in a \"missing fetus\" case. The pathologist's report seemingly verified Mrs. Van Klausen's statement that the fetus had disappeared. It stated that material removed by surgery was \"decidua chorionic villi, no fetal parts.\" The report from Dr. Levine covered Mrs. Van Klausen's obstetrical history since 1982, but seemed, in one paragraph pertaining to her 1989 pregnan- cy, to confirm the witness' suspicions. He wrote, \"Had con- sultative scan again done which revealed fetus but no car- diac activity, consistent with missed abortion ... Path report revealed decidua chorionic villi, no fetal parts.\" In other words, Morgana had been pregnant with a \"fetus,\" but even though no miscarraige or spontaneous abortion had occurred, no fetal parts were recovered in surgery which was performed only a few hours after a vaginal ultrasound had revealed a \"dead fetus.\" The situation did, indeed, seem mysterious MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 283 November 1991"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"and well-deserving of full investigation. A personal interview with Dr. Levine was the next logical step. Mrs. Van Klausen told Dr. Levine that she had a interest in UFO research in general, and had become acquainted with local researchers who were interested in \"missing fetus\" cases. She did not share, and to present still has not shared, with him the fact of her own entity encounters or her suspicion that her \"missing fetus\" might have been the result of UFO activity. She put her request on the basis that a qualified researcher wished to gather medical information which might throw light on \"missing fetus\" reports, and was objectively interested in such reports but open to the possibility that they could be explained in conventional terms. She provided written permission for Dr. Levine to discuss aspects of her own case as it might apply to other reported cases. An hour's consulta- tion fee was agreed upon. B ecause this situation seemed to promise verification of an actual \"missing fetus\" report the Fund for UFO Research granted the funds necessary to explore the case. On June 28, 1991, this writer (Druffel) held an hour interview with Dr. Levine and with his permission, record- ed it on audiotape. He was open and forthcoming to all ques- tions put to him; no reference was made at any time to Mrs. Van Klausen's personal entity encounters. The consultation had two main purposes: 1) to verify whether or not Mrs. Van Klausen's fetus had disappeared under mysterious circumstances; and 2) to learn of any conventional, medical reasons why a fetus would appear to disappear abruptly. Dr. Levine confirmed that he had left Mrs. Van Klausen with the impression initially that the 1989 pregnancy was proceeding well, even though she had some abdominal pain and spotting, and even though he detected no cardiovascular activity in the fetus at the time of the first ultrasound on February 28 1989. Although he suspected at the time that it was a non- viable fetal pole [i.e., gestational tissue which was not develop- ing into a normal fetus] he gave it the benefit of the doubt. Ordinarily, his office ultrasound equipment can pick up car- diovascular activity as early as five weeks' gestation, provided the fetus is positioned favorably toward the machine. The fetus was only about five weeks gestation at the February 28, 1989 visit, and Dr. Levine hoped that it was viable but too small or positioned in such a way that cardiovascular activity could not be detected. This type of reassurance is common prac- tice among obstetricians, who prefer to wait and see if fetal viability can be detected a few weeks later, rather than to worry the patient. A month later, however, at Mrs. Van Klausen's next visit a second ultrasound scan again failed to detect cardiac ac- tivity. He informed Morgana of this fact and sent her that same day to Dr. Holland, a perinatologist, for a consultative scan. This specialist had a more powerful ultrasound machine; by means of a vaginal transducer, he confirmed non-viability. Morgana remembers Dr. Holland telling her that \"her baby THE FUND FOR UFO RESEARCH GRANTED THE FUNDS NECESSARY TO EXPLORE THE CASE had developed normally until about six or seven weeks ges- tation and then had died.\" She was given a choice to go home and wait for nature to miscarry [spontaneously abort] the fetus, or to have surgical intervention. She chose the quicker route, and the surgery was scheduled for that same afternoon. Dr. Levine explained why he had avoided Mrs. Van Klausen's direct question about \"the sex of the fetus.\" She had had what is termed a \"missed abortion,\" that is, a medical abnormality which occurs when the fetal pole, having grown in size for several weeks within an expanding uterus, fails to develop into a viable fetus. A fetal pole is included, medical- ly, under the general term, chorionic villi, i.e., \"products of conception,\" but is not a true fetus, that is, a developing, viable baby with arms, legs, head, etc. For this reason, the pathologist wrote, \"Decidua chorionic villi, no fetal parts.\" Dr. Levine stated that what happened to Mrs. Van Klausen was not at all uncommon. He explained that when a woman becomes pregnant, the developing, fertilized ovum separates into a \"animal pole\" and a \"vegetable pole\" The animal pole becomes the potential fetus and, until viability is confirmed, is known as the fetal pole. The vegetable pole becomes the afterbirth, that is, placenta, sac, and other products of conception. When Mrs. Van Kausen, immediately after awakening from the surgery, asked him what sex the baby had been, Dr. Levine had no answer. He thought it best to spare her feelings and said he would speak about it later when she came to his office. He explained, in the interview, that patients usually do not know the distinction be- tween \"fetal pole\" and \"fetus,\" and did not think it advisable to go into a long explanation in the recovery room. Missed abortion, in Dr. Levine's words is a non-viable pregnancy which continues for more than 12 weeks. Before the era of ultrasound as a tool in obstetrics, physicians usually waited until nature miscarried the pregnancy spon- taneously. Now, however, with improved technology to detect non-viability, physicians can intervene earlier. He states that he has never seen a case of \"missed abortion\" go more than five months. When Mrs. Van Klausen came to his office two weeks later and asked him again what had happened, he showed her the pathologist's report — i.e., a confirmed pregnancy, no fetal parts recovered. When Morgana asked how that could hap- pen, he replied that he could not explain it because medical science has no real answers as to why some fetuses develop into normal babies and some do not. He had no idea, at that time, that Morgana was thinking of the concept of \"missing fetuses\" as described in UFO literature. She never discussed her interest in UFOs with him until just before the research interview was planned. He was not aware that she thought there was anything otherworldly or mysterious about the event. This only added to the essential misunderstanding of terms which developed between them. MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 283 November 1991"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"D r. Levine emphasized that medical terms are not precise enough, as regards conversations between physicians and lay persons, and suggested that this situation should be rectified somehow, to avoid misunder- standings like this. \"You can say that our terminology is not very good, qualifying the situation, and that doctors should straighten out their terminology. I wouldn't argue with that,\" he stated. He cited, for example, the inter- changeable ways in which \"fetal pole\" and \"fetus\" were used on the pathologist's and perinatologist's reports, as well as on his own report written for the patient. It was ap- parent that imprecise terminology had caused her to suspect that her unborn baby had mysteriously disappeared. Dr. Levine had told her that he had no explanation for the loss of her fetus simply because cases of missed abor- tion, and other situations of nonviability in developing fetuses, are not well understood by the medical profession. \"Something in Nature senses that something has gone wrong with the pregnancy and rejects it,\" he stated. \"How the rejection mechanism works is not understood. But is it people in flying saucers, or visitors or extraterrestrial intelligences that is intervening in our lives? I would think that's a far-fetched answer.\" The consultant, Dr. Holland, according to Dr. Levine's records, reported seeing a \"gestational sac\" [fetal pole] on March 24, which had enlarged to the size of a seven-week fetus; this was referred to, alternately as \"fetal pole\" and \"fetus\" on his written report. Since Morgana recalled that this consulting physician had described her pregnancy as viable up to six weeks and afterward had died, Dr. Levine advised that we consult with Dr. Holland personally on this. When the pathology report revealed \"decidua chorionic villi\" — that is, vegetable projects of conception, including an early placenta — but \"no fetal parts,\" there was nothing mysterious here, Dr. Levine explained. It is actual fetal parts, that is, parts or members of a fetus' body that pathologists look for. Pathologists, according to Dr. S., have no obliga- tion to, or interest in, looking for and reporting on finding portions of a fetal pole. Since Mrs. Van Klausen's medical history was consistent with \"missed abortion\" and since no fetal parts were expected to be found in such a diagnosis, the phrase \"no fetal parts\" is in no way suggestive of a disap- peared or missing fetus. The misunderstanding occurred because most patients are not inclined to ask precise ques- tions as to whether the products of their miscarriage are fetal poles or true fetuses. Dr. Levine also described several other abnormalities which can cause miscarriage/spontaneous abortion, such as severe genetic abnormalities which amount to lethal chromosome combinations. Sometimes in these cases, the fetal pole develops cardiovascular activity and distorted limbs, etc., but later dies in the womb. In cases of blighted ovum, the em- bryo dies within a few days of conception, and the sac, when \"NATURE SENSES SOMETHING WRONG WITH THE PREGNANCY AND REJECTS IT. HOW THE REJECTION WORKS IS NOT UNDERSTOOD\" aborted spontaneously, is empty. Both of these situations, plus the condition termed \"false pregnancy\" might explain some \"missing fetus\" reports. Dr Levine stated that he knew of no case suggestive of a true \"missing fetus.\" He stated that any doctor, coming upon such a situation, would be obliged to document it thoroughly — which nowadays, with the advent of ultrasound and other advances in technology, is easily done. He stated that, with documentation backing a doctor, medical journals would will- ingly print articles describing real incidents of \"missing fetuses,\" yet to his knowledge no such case has been described in any medical journal. It is a common assumption in the UFO field, at least by non-medical researchers, that physi- cians encountering cases of \"missing fetuses\" would be extremely reluctant to discuss themr According to Dr. Levine, however, this is an inaccurate supposition. He maintained that a physician encountering such a mysterious occurrence would be anx- ious to talk about the case, because legally and medically he'd want to show that he did not do anything wrong. As a followup to the interview above, Morgana obtained a copy of the letter sent to Dr. Levine by the consulting specialist, Dr. Holland. At first glance it seemed to confirm her impression that the fetus had been viable up to the seventh week but, in her words, \"had died\" by the time of the March 24, 1989 scan. The report stated, \"Intrauterine pregnancy was seen in the gestational sac crown/rump length of the fetus measured 12 cm, consistent with seven weeks and four days of gestation. Despite well-defined pole and crown/rump length, no fetal cardiac activity was seen.\" The advisability of consulting with Dr. Holland was con- sidered by the investigators, but since he had seen Morgana only once, and since 18 months had passed, it was not logical to suppose he would remember the case well enough to discuss it fully. Instead, his report was discussed with Richard M. Neal, Jr., M.D., himself an obstetrician/gynecologist. In his opi- nion, the perinatologist, in using the term \"fetus,\" was describ- ing a fetal pole instead of a well-defined fetus, just as Dr. Levine had done in his report. Dr. Neal stated that at seven weeks the embryo/fetal pole is not as well-defined as a fetus even a few weeks later would be. A viable seven-week fetus would still be in the embryo stage, where the arms and legs are still buds instead of well-formed limbs, and the term \"crown-rump\" does not necessarily indicate measurement of a well-formed baby but rather means the length from the top of the fetal pole/embryo to the point where it curves naturally at the place where legs, etc., develop later in a viable fetus. I n conclusion, this case presents a breakthrough in the UFO research field; for the first time adequate medical documentation, plus personal verification, has been received from a physician involved in a \"missing fetus\" report. In-depth research into the situation has revealed that what MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 283 November 1991"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"seemed to be an actual \"missing fetus\" case turned out to be a conventional, medical event, according to the primary physician, Dr. Levine. One of the more surprising results of the consultation was Dr. Levine's statement that if true cases of missing fetuses did occur, the doctors involved would be anxious to make them public, provided they could document them thoroughly. The fact that this has not happened to date seems to demonstrate that the term \"missing fetus,\" as used in the UFO research field, might be a misnomer. If other reports of such are followed up in detail, they might also turn out to have non-mysterious explanations. It is suggested that every attempt possible be made to obtain full documentation on any such case before it is assumed that \"disappearing fetus\" cases ac- tually occur, especially as related to unidentified entity encounters.

FAX: (512) 828-4507 A GLIMPSE INSIDE THE INNER SANCTUM To a research specialist, input and feedback of informa- tion is vital. In my pursuit into the UFO Crash/Retrieval sector, 1991 was a most rewarding year. To this end I must give credit to the emerging number of cooperative infor- mants, newcomers as well as time-tested contemporaries, who were willing to share, for various expressed reasons, unusual firsthand material, some of it from former \"in- siders.\" When the Iraqi War ended I began collecting this material for a routine status report but, to my surprise, the cornucopia continued to exude a bounty of new and correlative data so that by September I had finished a book of some 80,000 words: UFO Crash/Retrievals: The In- ner Sanctum. It was Status Report VI of my series of monographs. A local printer was preferred as publisher so I could control the copy and any last minute changes or additions. The choice of \"Inner Sanctum\" as part of my title was apt because it imparted an atmosphere of mystery shrouding an invisible, elite force who possess extra- ordinary powers, allegedly backed by black budgets, to maintain control over a worldwide ufological domain. In my book I show some examples of how the Sanctum may operate. Status Report VI covers all aspects of the Crash/Retrieval mystery. Accented is the Roswell Inci- dent and many other crashes (and landings) in New Mex- ico and environs during the late 1940's. The Kecksburg Crash is also featured, with new firsthand witnesses, as well as other alleged crashes, some of which predate Roswell. Also revealed are landings of alien craft. One \"inside\" source claims that aliens were found in a state of suspended animation; in another case, my source witnessed human body parts. Beyond crashes and land- ings, I go behind scenes to recount stories of intrigue, my personal misadventures, the ploys and successes of orchestrated disinformation, and many other affairs of a seemingly surreal nature surrounding UFOs. But in spite, of the overwhelming evidence that crashes of alien craft are a fact, there are still many loose ends in the fabric. Study in this sector must go on. Also stressed is a word of caution to be wary of the haunting spectre of disinformation which has so effec- tively muddied the waters of research for years. Confu- sion in the ranks is a key to the success of secrecry. Another key is the factor of divide and conquer. You may note that I did not hatchet others with differing views than mine in my book. If you read UFO Crash/Retrievals: The Inner Sanctum, I invite you to be the judge of its voluminous information.

Neal, Jr., M.D. Abstract A common physiological complaint made by both UFO witnesses and alleged abductees is that of physical paralysis. Associated with this temporary paralysis may be a tingling, electrical type shock or numbing sensation felt over the body. The individuals involved report being immobilized by a varie- ty of sources, including light beams directed from the UFO, hand-held objects carried by the alien humanoids or \"en- tities,\" and other unknown causes. Although many theories have been offered as to the etiology (origin or cause) of this particular form of paralysis, none has completely explained the phenomenon. James M. McCampbell, working with ex- perimental data, gives an excellent analysis of paralysis associated with the action potential of nerve cells. 1 Dr. Richard C. Niemtzow has also researched nerve fiber types and functions as related to paralysis 2 . In this article, the author will review the basic normal physiological functions of the Central Nervous System (the brain and its branches), which is essential to paralysis, fol- lowed by a discussion of the specific biological effects of microwave radiation on the human species. F irst we need a basic definition of what is meant by paralysis. Dorland's Illustrated Medical Dictionary defines it as \"Loss or impairment of motor function in part due to lesion of the neural or muscular mechanism; also, by analogy, impairment of sensory func- tion (sensory paralysis).\" 3 A long list of specific types of paralysis follows. For our purposes we can focus on three particular categories: • Functional Paralysis — A temporary paralysis which is apparently not caused by a nerve lesion. • Peripheral Paralysis — Loss of power due to lesions of the nervous mechanism between the nucleus of origin and periphery. • Phonetic Paralysis — Paralysis of the muscles of speech. Assuming that none of the Abductees and/or Witnesses exposed to UFO activity had any type of neural lesions normally associated with the nervous system, we can hypothetically classify their immobility as a type of trau- matic functional paralysis. We will limit the article to the integrated Central Nervous System and the appropriate ef- Dr. Neal is a practicing obstetrician and gynecologist liv- ing in Lawndale, California.

The latter is an extremely difficult subject to discuss; voluminous research continues to try to understand the function and interaction of micro- waves with living organisms. Central Nervous System The Central Nervous System can be said to consist of three distinct levels: the spinal cord, lower brain and higher brain, or cortex. Each portion of the nervous system performs specific functions. While many integrative functions are well developed in the spinal cord, many of the subconscious func- tions of the brain originate and are executed entirely in the brain's lower regions. But it is the cortex that opens the world up for one's mind. So we first need to understand the physiology of the motor cortex, or highest level, of the brain. The attic of the brain, if you will, is divided into a Primary Motor and Premotor area (Figures 1 & 2). These areas, along with the basal ganglia and cerebellum, constitute a complex overall system for voluntary control of muscle activity. Pen- field's famous topographical map of the Motor Corex il- lustrates the relationship between certain body parts and specific areas of the cortex. (Figure 3) This \"mental map\" was discovered by stimulating the different areas of the Motor Cortex in human beings undergoing neurosurgical operations. Other areas of the cortex that are important to the possible paralysis or temporary immobilization of the Central Ner- vous System include the following: The Somatic Sensory Cortex - This is located in the area of the cerebral cortex and is associated with a number of specialized sensoryjreceptors in each respective peripheral area of the body. Microwave fields are known to induce cur- rents in electrical conductors; therefore, since an individual's moist skin acts as a good conductor and has numerous sen- sory receptors, a prickling or tingling sensation would result from the interaction. The Autonomic Nervous System - This system is respon- sible for the creation of two synoptically -transmitted substances, acetylcholine and norepinephrine, which are essential for nerve-muscle interaction. This will be elaborated on briefly in this article. Because the Central Nervous System of the body contains a series of nerve cells that vary in size, shape, length, loca- tion and stimuli impulses/responses, we consider the body's Central Nervous System as a giant electrical circuit. It is the disruption of this circuit by microwave radiation that needs indepth research studies. In searching for the etiology of paralysis certain criteria should be considered, not the least of which is the nature of the specific electromagnetic MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 283 November 1991"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"radiation itself. Microwaves are generally defined as wavelengths measured in centimeters, roughly from 30 cm to 1 mm, or 1 to 300 GHz (gigahertz). Thus, microwave frequencies lie below the infra-red band. The amount of individual microwave exposure that would cause symptoms, including paralysis, would de- pend on several parameters, such as power density, frequen- cy and exposure time. Herman Schwan showed that the electric properties of human tissues at microwave frequencies contain two parts: a relative dielectric constant and specific resistivity. He came to the conclusion that at low frequencies (f « 2.5 GHz), microwave radiation is fairly pene- trating and changes slowly with fre- quency, whereas at high frequencies (f S> 3 GHz), the total microwave radia- tion absorbed by the body is converted into heat in the skin. 4 In general summation, it is known that dense, highpower microwave en- ergy can result in pathophysiological/biological effects of a thermal nature, while lower power densities can affect neural and immunological functions; not only in humans, but also in animals. Investigations of microwave effects on chemical communica- tions between peripheral nerves and muscles are also of in- terest, since these peripheral synapses are more easily ac- cessible for experiments than those within the brain. The neurotransmitters involved, mainly acetylcholine and noradrenaline, also promote synaptic communication in the brain. Consequently, events at peripheral synapses can be viewed, with limitations, as a model for synaptic events within the brain itself. T he investigations of Servantie et al (1974) 5 and Syn- gajevskaja (1968) 6 into transmission between motor nerves and skeletal muscles (for which acetylcholine is the transmitter chemical) indicate that microwaves change the sensitivity of these synapses to applied drugs, and therefore possibly alter the action of the endogenous transmitter as well. The normal function of these cholinergic (acetylcholine mediated) synapses depends on the presence of an enzyme, acetylcholinesterase, which terminates neuro-transmissions by destroying acetylcholine released within the synapse im- mediately after it serves its transmitter purpose. Interference with acetylcholinesterase can seriously impair nerve-muscle or interneuronal communication. It has been claimed that chronic low level microwave exposure reduces cholinesterase activity in the brain, blood and internal organs (Nikogosyan 1960, 1964: cited by Presman, 1970). 7 ' 8 Varied effects occur with high level exposure. Safety standards for microwave radiation exposure state that for normal environmental conditions and for incident elec- tromagnetic energy of frequencies from 10 MHz to 100 GHz, the MW radiation protection guide is 10 mW/cm 2 . Table 1 tabulates the microwave radiation safety standards of the PROJECT PANDORA WAS UN- DERTAKEN TO DETERMINE THE HEALTH AND PSYCHO- LOGICAL EFFECTS OF LOW INTENSITY MICROWAVES United States and USSR. Extensive review of experimental data done on various animals with microwave exposure and biological effects on the nervous system has brought about mostly empirical obser- vations. Obviously, research of this nature can never be car- ried out on the human species. We have only collected and reported data on the health hazards and biological effects suf- fered by individuals who work around equipment that emits microwave radiation. For security reasons, microwave health effects were of some interest to the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA). Apparently theirs was the first prompted U.S. study of health effects of low intensity (or non-thermal) microwaves. From 1965 to 1970, Project Pandora was under- taken to determine the health and psychological effects of low intensity microwaves. This study was done because there was some suspicion that die American Embassy in Moscow was being subjected to microwave irradiation. CIA agents asked top scientists involved in microwave research to study whether microwaves beamed at humans from a distance could affect the brain and alter behavior. Dr. Milton Zaret, who undertook to analyze Soviet literature on microwaves for the CIA, wrote, \"For non-thermal irradia- tions, they believe that the electromagnetic field induced by the microwave environment affects the cell membrane, and this results in an increase in the level of excitation of nerve cells. With repeated or continued exposure, the increased ex- citability leads to a state of exhaustion of the cells of the cerebral cortex. This results in the Sechenov inhibition ef- fect, which is manifested by the elimination of positive con- ditioned reflexes or behavior modification.\" 9 I won't dwell on the extensive research that has been done on microwave exposure in the U.S.; however, I would like to state that in 1984, a report prepared by Rosalie Bertell, Figure 1 MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 283 November 1991"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"Promoter cortex Primary motor cortu Word (ornnllon IBraei'i arei| Figure 2 Commissioner for the International Commission of Health Professionals for Human Rights, a non-governmental organiza- tion based in Geneva, Switzerland, showed an unusual pat- tern of illness ranging from \"severe headaches, drowsiness, menstrual bleeding at abnormal times or post-menopausal, to bouts of temporary paralysis, faulty speech coordination, and in one case apparent circulatory failure requiring hospitalization.\" These were exposures of microwave irradia- tion on women peace activists at the U.S.A.F. base in Greenham, England. 10 Many questions have been raised as to the specific microwave frequencies at which paralysis/immobilization and other various symptoms are known to occur. The answer to that question is unknown. Once again I would have to refer to the potential possibilities unfolded by Project Pandora's research, namely that microwaves, perhaps modulated with low biological frequencies, are used from a distance to cause performance decrements and disorganization by interfering with neuroelectric function; or by causing central nervous system effects, subjective feelings of ill health, or health syn- dromes associated with periodic exposures at intensities below 10,000 microWatts/cm 2 or 10 mW/cm 2 . However, human beings exposed to pulsed microwave radia- tion hear an audible sound which appears to originate from within or near the head (microwave-induced auditory effect). This sound has been described as a click, buzz or chirp de- pending on factors such as a pulse width and repetition rate. Experimentally it was found that pulses of 1 to 32 /is pulse width at a frequency of 2.45 GHz. could be heard as distinct clicks originating from within or immediately behind the head. In this study, the power density varied from 40 to 1 W/cm 2 with an average incident power density of 0.12 mW/cm 2 at 45-decibel background noise. The pulsed microwave energy initiates a thermoelastic wave of pressure in brain tissue that activates the inner ear receptors via bone conduction.\" Paralysis and/or immobilization related to UFO activity Figure 3 may stem from pulsed, low microwave frequencies (f » 2.5 GHz) which are able to penetrate the cranium and thus af- fect those portions of the cerebral cortex previously described in a fashion similar to the microwave-induced auditory effect. As previously mentioned, the key to paralysis involves the motor unit. When the Witnesses/Abductees are subjected to brief exposure of low power density microwaves, the physical effects on the motor units of the musculoskeletal system can be analyzed via procedures known as wave sum- mation and tetanization. (Figure 4). Wave summation from pulsed microwave radiation could set into motion a frequency ^f twitches of the muscles which con- tinues to rise above 10 pei; second. The first muscle twitch is not completely over by the time the second one begins; therefore, since the muscle is already in a partially contracted state when the second twitch begins, the degree of muscle shortening this time is slightly greater than that which occurs with a single muscle twitch. At more rapid states of contract- ing the degree of summation of successive contractions be- comes greater and greater, because the successive contractions appear at earlier times following the preceding contraction. This could be correlated with a pulsed microwave energy field. When a muscle is stimulated at progressive greater frequen- cies, a frequency is finally reached at which the successive contractions fuse together and cannot be distinguished one from the other. This state is called tetanization. Once the initiation of wave summation and tetanization are consummated, this brings into motion a series of chain reactions involving the neuroendocrine and central nervous system — all leading to the fused state of muscles, thereby causing immobiliza- tion/paralysis of the individual's musculoskeletal system. Abductees/Witnesses exposed to microwave irradiation may exhibit the following: • Paralysis 1) Paralysis/immobilization of entire body (remains upright). MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 283 November 1991"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"2) Paralysis of the speech center. • Areas of Non-Paralysis 1) Sensorium intact. 2) Respiratory system. 3) Cardio-vascular system. • Senses Not Affected or Partially Affected 1) Hearing (clicks, buzz or chirp). 2) Smell. 3) Sight (may have temporary blindness). 4) Taste. 5) Touch. There appears to be some definite form of selectivity from microwave irradiation as related to individuals exposed to UFO activity. If the total body were paralyzed, the individuals in- volved would almost certainly die. Microwaves affecting the motor cortex with its predilection for the musculoskeletal system and the somatic sensory areas appear to have little or no effect on the respiratory and cardio-vascular system centers located in the medulla oblongata, pons and hypothalamus areas of the brain respectively, which are essen- tial to life. Conclusion I have,tried to give a hypothesis on the relationship of paralysis as associated with microwave exposure. Certainly it is with sheer speculation on my behalf that alien-beings could have acquired a technique to render humans immobile through a selective type of microwave irradiation unknown to our modern day technology. This would have to set up a chain reaction in the Central Nervous System to affect only certain areas and spare those that are essential to vital biological functions. Going by the data and research done by Schwan, I would have to assume that only microwaves below 3 GHz (gigahertz) could reach the cranium and brain areas SAFETY STANDARDS OF MICROWAVE RADIATION 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 55 Rate of stimulation (times per second) Type United States Occupational and general public (ANSI 1982) OSHA Occupational (Army and Air Force 1965) Occupational and general public (ANSI proposed) Frequency (GHz) 0.01-100 0.01-100 0.01-300 0.0003-0.003 0.003-0.03 Radiation limit 10 mW/cm 2 10 mW/cm 2 10 mW/cm 2 100 mW/cm 2 100-1 mW/cm 1 Exposure time 6 min 6 min 6 min 6 m ' n 6 fin 0.3-1.5 1.5-100 1-5 mW/cm 2 5 mW/cm 2 USSR Occupational (1977) General public (1970) 0.01-0.3 0.3-300 0.3-300 20-5 V/m 0.01-1 V/m 0.001 V/m 1 working day 1 working day 1 working day Table 1 Figure 4 to cause not only paralysis but the other CNS symptoms. The musculoskeletal response would depend upon the pro- ximity of the UFO and the energy field emanating from it; therefore, artifically directed/induced stimuli causing im- mobilization/paralysis by a directed energy field could be possible with highly advanced medical technology carried out by \"alien humanoids.\" We could speculate again that studies have probably been conducted on earth inhabitants for cen- turies (assuming you accept the extraterrestial theory). These humanoids may have mastered the CNS of humans centuries ago through trial and error experimentation. Perhaps this was done in an effort to protect themselves from a hostile or unknown environment or to protect humans who were close to being seriously injured by the proximity of a UFO, and lastly, probably as a technique to render humans docile/passive so that certain genetic experimentations/im- plementations could be carried out. Finally, some of the other physiological effects associated with exposures to UFO activity could be attributed to infrared and ultraviolet radiation, as well as highly ionized gases or toxic gases which could be produced within the at- mosphere, or to emissions from high energy radiation sources. However, there is a need for more extensive ap- plied research in that area. I hope this article will stimulate other researchers to expand on this theory or seek other alternatives. References 1.

Others branch out to encompass more and more aspects of the unidentified tree that is the UFO phenomenon. For instance, a daylight disk case may also involve radar confirmation and visual sighting by ground or airborne observers or both, in which case it becomes, in the vernacular, a radar / visual sighting. On occasion, however, a single case seems to have it all. The Rendlesham Forest affair detailed in From Out of the Blue, the latest book from the prolific pen of Jenny Randies, BUFORA's director of in- vestigations, appears to be a case in point. About the only thing miss- ing is a mutilated animal, a full-fledged abduction obtained via regressive hypnosis and the proverbial kitchen sink. Otherwise, it's all here, from multiple witnesses, radar blips, lights in the night, physical traces and possible diminuitive beings, to radia- tion readings, disappearing evidence, animal reactions, vehicle in- terference effects, threatening phone calls and bruitings of a government and military collusion to cover-up events and stifle research. Did I mention erratic or nonexistent media coverage, disinformation and confusion? I probably should have, because no one is yet certain what actually took place in the pine forest separating Woodbridge and Bentwaters Air Force Bases in East Anglia, England, over the 1980 Christmas weekend. Indeed, this is Randle's second attempt to make sense of the sequence of events that faraway weekend, the first, Sky Crash (October 1984) having been co-authored with two other British lady ufologists, Dot Street and Brenda Butler. Much has come to light since that first rushed potboiler, and most of it has served to thicken, rather than thin, the resulting stew. For starters, this may well be the most effective writing from Randies to date, which is by no means meant to disparage any of her many previous books. Let's just say Blue is a gripping read, and get the minor quibbles out of the way at the outset. First, the author has replaced a fondness for exclamation marks with an equally nagging proclivity for CAPITAL LET- TERS this time around. Fortunately, these are mainly three-letter af- fairs along the lines of AND, ALL, ONE or THE. Occasionally it's effective; mostly it's distracting. There are also numerous typos throughout the text. (Brain, for instance, for Brian.) I probably should point out here that I'm working with advance galleys supplied by Timothy Green Beckley, editor of the news- stand UFO Universe magazine and the enfant terrible par excellence of UFO publishing in this country. The cover is rather garish and there is no index, but calibrating such cavils aside, Beckley has done himself proud simply by making this book readily available to the American reading public and should be so commended. That same public should support both Beckley and Randies by promptly picking up a copy. (Write Global Communications for postage and details.

Something undoubtedly hap- pened in Rendlesham Forest on two consecutive nights in late December of 1980, which ultimately resulted in a three-paragraph report being filed by then Depu- ty Base Commander Lt. Colonel Charles Halt with Royal Air Force authorities in London. (Both bases, \"leased\" from the British, are scheduled to be phased out in 1993.) The opening sentence of paragraph three reads as follows: \"Later in the night a red sun-like light was seen through the trees. It moved about and pulsed. At one point it appeared to throw off glowing particles and then broke into five separate white objects and then disappeared.\" This sequence of events, which Halt himself personally witnessed, followed hard on the heels of an even more bizarre scenario the night before, testified to by three base person- nel and outlined in Halt's first paragraph: \"The individuals reported seeing a strange glowing object in the forest. The object was described as being metalic (sic) in appearance and triangular in shape, approximately two to three meters across the base and approximately two meters high. It il- luminated the entire forest with a white light. The object itself had a pulsing red light on top and a bank(s) of blue lights underneath. The object was hovering or on legs. As the patrolmen approached the object, it manuevered through the trees and disappeared. At this time the animals on a near- by farm went into a frenzy.\" And then the subterfuge began. Despite inquiries by the local ladies, the Halt memo only surfaced more than two years later, following a Freedom of Information request in- itiated by American ufologist Robert Todd. A year later, Randies received in the mail, anonymously (shades of MJ-12!), a copy of an audiotape reportedly made by Halt while leading a small detachment of troops through the woods in search of evidence, during which above normal radiation readings were detected and the triangle-shaped ob- ject was again witnessed. All in all, about 30 eyewitnesses were involved, of which Randies et al have personally in- terviewed about a third. (Anyone who saw the 1991 season premier episode of NBC-TV's \"Unsolved Mysteries\" was probably startled by the sight of Colonel Halt testifying in his own behalf.) A few miles east of the end of Woodbridge runway towers the Orford Ness lighthouse, its powerful safety beam re- volving in regular five second intervals. The skeptics have focused on the lighthouse as the probable source of the \"UFO\" seen by Halt and his men. This mundane solution to what transpired over two nights, and which Randies finds wanting, is at least somewhat bolstered (and complicated) by the fact that a brillant meteor was seen over England dur- ing the same time period, followed by incoming Soviet space debris. Could these coincidental events have \"conspired\" to create one of the more enigmatic UFO episodes in modern memory? Randies strives manfully to make sense out of all these competing stimuli and scenarios, sifting wheat from chaff \"IT WAS JUST LIKE MAGIC. I THINK THAT'S WHAT FREAKED MOST PEOPLE OUT. NOT WHAT IT WAS, BUT THE CRAZY. UNBELIEVABLE THINGS IT COULD DO.\" as best as possible, given the decade interlude. What emerges is a curious case hovering somewhere in the Twilight Zone — halfway between earthbound technology and extrater- restrial exoticism. The author presents four widely varying solutions for the facts as known, but wisely lets the reader choose whichever one best suits his or her understanding of the phenomenon. No force-feeding of the ET hypothesis here, although alien visitors turn up as one of the alternatives, as does the possibility of some as yet unknown natural force field, and the possibility that the UFO scenario itself is but a closely leaked alibi to cover up Star Wars or other secret machinery. From Out of the Blue, while not exactly a bolt from above, is well worth your time, money and attention. Despite her personal involvement, Randies has written a dispassionate work that engages and enthralls the reader.

At 7:15 a.m. the airliner was cruising east of Abilene, Texas, on Air- way G-5. The altimeter read 4500 feet. Suddenly a bright green object streaked past the airliner at the same altitude and holding the same course. As nearly as the crew could judge, the projectile- shaped device was about the size of the airliner. As it raced ahead, the pilots saw a white trail, which they took to be ex- haust vapor. The DC-4 was cruising at 220 miles an hour, and it was only a matter of seconds before the strange green fireball had shot ahead. Then, to the crew's amazement, the strange missile exploded, shooting red balls of fire in all directions. \"It was like a Fourth of July roman candle,\" the First Officer said later. (The Flying Saucer Conspiracy by Donald Keyhoe) 1956 • At about 9 a.m. on the eighth, an employee of North American Avia- tion, who worked at the Cape Canaveral missile launch center, and a few of his friends, observed two UFOs \"pull in behind a F-100 jet fighter,\" at about 25,000 feet. \"They came up fast,\" and one of the objects passed the jet \"in a sweeping turn on its edge.\" The aircraft made a tight turn in an effort to pursue the UFO, but couldn't catch it \"because it left him before he could shake the con- trol stick.\" Prior to observing the above UFO activity from the Coco Beach, Florida area, which is located south of the Cape, all of the witnesses watched the launch of a missle from the Cape. None of them observed UFO activity at that time. One witness, however, work- ing near Sharpes, about 10 miles west of the Cape, reported that he watched a bright, round object follow the missile into space. About two hours after the sightings near the Cape, a UFO played aerial tag over the tip of Florida for several minutes before shooting out into space. Donald Freestone, a Pan American World Air- ways radar expert, picked up the UFO at 11:15 a.m. while testing weather radar equipment in the PAA shops at Miami International Airport. Surprised by the unexpected target return on the screen, he called fellow employees. Six of them watched the object on the radar screen for 20 minutes. None of them knew what it was. \"I didn't believe in such things before, said Freestone. \"But after this happened, I got some books and read up on it. Now I'm convinced it was some- thing that is out of our experience, so far as aircraft are concerned.\" Freestone said the UFO was \"four to five times larger than any aircraft ob- served in the past.\" The UFO appeared to be egg-shaped or oval-shaped. \"It ap- peared at approximately 65 miles southwest of Miami, at an altitude of be- tween 7000 and 8000 feet,\" Freestone said. \"It disappeared and reappeared several times. I found that by turning the antenna tilt up, it could be brought back on the screen. It disappeared once at 70 miles and reappeared at about 55 miles, then moved back to 70 miles. The speed was estimated at 550 to 650 miles per hour. It then moved in to 50 miles and remained stationary for two to three minutes. Then it moved to the southwest, the direction it had came from. At one time the target moved 20 miles in about six sweeps or rotations of the antenna, which rotates at a speed of 20 times per minute.\" That would be a flying speed of about 4000 MPH. While the above UFO activity was occurring, Homestead Air Force Base, located south-southwest of Miami, was put on an \"alert\" status. (S.P.A.C.E. newsletter, Jan. 1957 & Feb. 1957) • Calvin Goetz, a railroad telegrapher, watched a ball of fire follow a freight train into the Lemmon, South Dakota yards at daybreak on the 16th. Goetz said that the object, estimated to be about 25 feet from the ground, stopped when the train stopped, then swooped over the stockyards and sped away. As the UFO moved away, a noise, as if lightning had struck, was heard in the depot and as far away as Baker, Mon- tana. Goetz then tried to call the next station, only to find the railroad phones and the automatic block system were mysteriously dead. After Goetz had aroused a lineman, they started function- ing again, just as mysteriously. Goetz said the light form was about three feet in diameter. (The Tribune, Mobridge, SD, 11/22/56; The Pioneer Press, Mott, ND, 11/22/56) • South Dakota State Police Officer Don Kelm was driving on Highway 31, about 25 miles east of Pierre, with Jack Peters, dispatcher for the state radio system as his passenger, when sudden- ly they came upon a strange object. It was about 12:15 a.m. on the 25th, and \"we came over the top of this hill,\" Kelm said, \"and right down there in the valley below us was this object. We were within a block of it. I slammed on the brakes. I thought we were going to run into it, we were that close.\" The two men got out of the car and watched it for a few minutes. When they first saw it, the bright red UFO was hovering a few feet off the ground on the north side of the road. As they watched it, it rose up and away from them. The two men got back into their car and attempted to pursue the object. It stayed about a mile ahead of them. \"We must have driven after it for seven miles,\" Kelm said. \"It wouldn't let us go by it.\" The UFO moved back and forth across the road as they followed it.

Robert Coates, who accompanied his father, Sheriff Allen Coates, to the scene said the object was brilliantly lighted, and moved up and down. Young Coates said a jet interceptor made three passes at the object and on the third pass the pilot reported by radio that a blip registered on his radar screen. Coates said, however, that two other jets flying in the vicinity did not report picking up anything unusual on their radar. Coates said the jet's radio was being monitored by police radio.

The strange, seemingly metallic, substance came off of the UFO in thin fibers and settled to earth, draping itself like a finely-knit shroud over Goffs fields, trees, machinery and power lines. \"It was about 3 o'clock in the afternoon,\" Goff related, \"and I had been working in my shed. I came outside and happened to look up and see this strange ball flying through the air. It was kind of rough, and seemed to be rolling as it sped through the air. It was going faster than any airplane I ever saw and it just disap- peared from sight when it got out of sunlight. It made absolutely no noise. Big chunks of it broke off and these fibers began settling down on everything. The object was about four feet in diameter.\" The fibers could not be seen with the naked eye except when they were in direct sunlight. They could be felt on the skin like spider webs, but they were much smaller in diameter than a spider web. The human hair seemed like a rope compared to the fibers. Attempts to break the weird strings were to no avail. They could not be pulled apart, but when a hot cigarette was applied to one of the strands, it did break. The fiber did not seem to burn. No word was ever received from an Air Force team which was sup- posed to investigate the incident. And Goff said they never did contact him.

Mrs. Tibbetts ran to the dining room window as the house lights \"began blinking on and off.\" She observed a lighted area, then went into her son's room and saw a huge object with two tiers of four windows each. The size of one of the windows, she said, was as large as her living room wall. A bright yellowish-green light was being emitted from the windows. Then a \"very intense light\" was emitted from the object toward Mrs. Tibbetts. The witness was knock- ed backward. There were spots before her eyes. When her vision cleared, the UFO had disappeared. An eye examina- tion by a Dr. Nolan at the Exeter Clinic found only spasms in the eyelid and tear- ing. (\"Strange Effects From UFO,\" by Donald Key hoe and Gordon Lore, Jr.) • Al Wiselka and Leonard Kaiser were elk hunting around Dayton and Parkman, Wyoming on the 14th when they spot- ted strange lights up on a ridge near the Elk pastures above West Pass Creek. The next day on the way back they checked it out and found no house or dwelling which could have caused the light. They did find a semicircular area where the brush and grass was pressed flat and branches of brush on the perimeter clipped off. They also found the body of a fawn lying outside of the perimeter. Where the head and neck crossed the perimeter line, they had been cut clean off, with no other sign of blood or visi- ble wounds! The body lay there for weeks and was never touched by magpies or other scavengers; even flies and mag- gots left it alone.

Ronald was doing his evening chores on his parents' farm in rural Delphos, Kan- sas, about 7 p.m. on the second, when he heard a rumble as he approached the back side of the barn. About 50 yards away, he saw a sphereoid-shaped object hovering two feet off the ground. Because of the dazzling glow around the object, he couldn't distinguish the precise shape of the craft, but he later described it as domed at the top and bottom and bulging in the middle. \"When I tried to move I couldn't,\" Ronald said. \"I figure there was some kind of force from the object that kept me from moving.\" In the area where the object hovered for about five minutes, Ronald and his parents found a phosphorescent ring on the ground. The object was estimated to be about eight feet wide and 10 feet tall.

Traveling with him were his aide de campe, Commander Alfonso Crespo, a Lt. Col. piloting the plane, and a brigadier acting as a mechanic. At about 7:05 p.m., General Dols observed a white object three times the size of the moon that began to grow, \"forming a perfect semicircular halo with a white-gray color.\" The general's report indicated that inside the large halo and right on its center was a \"figure with a bright green color and the approximate form of a barrel, with a smaller and rec- tangular form of the same color above.\" Simultaneously, the phenomenon was also observed by the officers and crew of the Spanish Navy training ship \"Juan Sebastian Elcano,\" navigating between the island of Lanzarote and Las Palmas, the capital of the Grand Canary.

(News \\\\brld, New York, NY, 12/5/81) 1981 • A deputy sheriff and his wife, a town selectwoman, said they saw a UFO the night of the 28th , hovering over Route 43, that beamed a light at them and forced them to take another road home. Harold and Helen Hendsbee said they spotted the object while driving toward their home in Madison, Maine. \"The UFO hovered over the hill and it lit up the whole area, so we sat there and watched it,\" said Mrs. Hendsbee. \"I didn't see any object. I just saw a bright light. It was probably about a utility pole high and it was just stationary in space.\" Hensabee said he waited a few moments, then tried to drive over the hill, located in Starks, about 11 miles southwest of Madison. \"It advanced toward us, then stopped. I then backed up 30 to 40 yards and stopped.\" Hendsbee said he tried three times to pass. \"The second I started to go ahead the object moved toward us again, shin- ing the light right in my windshield. It was so bright I couldn't see in front of me.\" \"We had the feeling that it didn't want us to go up there,\" said Mrs. Hend- sbee. After 20 minutes, Hendsbee turned around and drove home along Route 148. While driving in the area earlier that evening, the Hendsbees came upon a car parked along the road with three men and a woman. Hendsbee stopped to see if they needed help. \"One of the guys told me, 'Don't go up over the hill, there is a UFO up there. If you do, you are going to witness something you won't want to see.' And then they drove off and I could see they were terrified.\" (Maine Telegram, Portland, ME, 12/1/81; Mor- ning Sentinel, Waterville, ME, 12/5/81) STATEMENT OF OWNERSHIP, MANAGEMENT AND CIRCULATION 1.

Andrus, Jr. Publisher LETTERS Dear Editor: I recently received my August 1991, MUFON Journal. While I am, as always, delighted to receive it, I must say I am also dismayed. Once again the main con- tent of the Journal is articles by one author or researcher either slamming another author or researcher or defend- ing himself and his ideas against a very nasty attack by an \"expert.\" It should be respectfully pointed out that for some people like me your Jourj nal is the only source of information that I have concerning the UFO phenomena. Our local newspapers and radio don't really carry adequate coverage, and since George Knapp moved on to other mat- ters I can't get much information from television either. It seems like in the last few months there must not have been any sightings, abductions, or cattle mutilations, etc., because all that appears to have been covered in print is one human trying to destroy the reputation of another human. Could we please have some updates on what is happening? Please remember there must be a lot of people out there like me, people who want to know but have to rely on the media for their information. — Arleene Langley Las Vegas, NV MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 283 November 1991"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"The Night Sky Walter N. Webb December 1991 Bright Planets: (Evening Sky) Jupiter, in Leo, rises in the E about 11:30 PM on the 1st, 10:30 in midmonth, and 9:30 on the 31st. The giant steadily brightens through the month, from magnitude -2.0 to -2.3. The planet begins retrograde (westward) motion on the 31st. Saturn (0.7), in Capricornus, appears low in the SW at dusk, setting in the WSW three hours after sunset. Bright Planets: (Morning Sky) Venus (-4.1) rises in the eastern sky about 3:30 AM in mid-December. Mars (1.4) reappears late in the month, moving from Scorpius into Ophiuchus. At that time the ruddy planet rises in the ESE shortly after 6 AM, about an hour before sunrise, and might be glimpsed very low in the SE twilight sky. Jupiter stands high in the SSW at dawn. Partial Lunar Eclipse: On the morning of December 21, observers throughout North America and Hawaii can view a small partial eclipse of the Moon. At 5:00 AM (EST) the southern edge of the full moon enters the Earth's dark central shadow. A max- imum of only 9% of the Moon's diameter is covered at 5:33. (The Moon is directly overhead at Hawaii.) Umbral eclipse ends at 6:06. Meteor Showers: After the quarter Moon sets around midnight, the sky will be best to view the annual Geminid meteors peak on the morning of the 14th. This shower is second to the Perseids in strength and in some years is even better than the August display. The predawn rate should be 50 or more meteors per hour. Look for bright, white streaks which appear to emanate from near the star Castor, one of the Twin Stars of Gemini. The shower is visible in lesser numbers December 7-15. Moon Phases: New moon — December 5 First quarter — December 14 Full moon — December 21 Last quarter — December 27 € O The Stars: By midevening the entire Winter circle of bright stars appears above the SE horizon — Sirius, Procyon, Pollux, Castor, Capella, Aldebaran and Rigel. Inside the circle stands the mighty warrior Orion, whose right shoulder is marked by reddish Betelgeuse, his belt by three stars in a row, and his left leg by blue- white Rigel. Three different types of variable stars whose changes in brightness can be detected with the naked eye are in good positions for viewing. They are red- dish Mira (in Cetus), which crosses the celestial meridian halfway up the southern sky about 8:45 PM in mid-December; Algol (in Perseus), on the meridian near the zenith at 9:30; and Delta Cephei (in Cepheus), the upper- most star in a small triangle at the up- per left corner of the King's \"house\" (on its side in midevening this month). Mira, a long-period variable, expands and contracts in a cycle of 11 months, dimming from about 3rd to 9th magnitude and back again to 3rd. Hav- ing attained peak brightness in August, Mira has dropped below naked-eye visibility and can now be seen in binoculars, using a star atlas to help locate it. Although Algol appears as one star, ac- tually it is two revolving about each other nearly in our line of sight. Once every three days the larger and dimmer companion partly eclipses the visible star, causing it to drop a whole magnitude in only 4'/2 hours (from 2nd to 3rd magnitude). Algol then returns to normal brightness in another 4'/2 hours. Finally, Delta Cephei is another star that expands and contracts, this time over a short period of 5.4 days. Dur- ing that interval it drops from 3.5 to 4.4 magnitude and returns to 3.5.

Box 17206, Tucson, AZ 85710 4th Symposium Ufology and Exobiology The Brazilian Academy of Para- sciences sponsored the 4th SUFOEX in Sao Paulo, Brazil on October 12 and 13, 1991. Since we were unable to publish the speaking program in the Journal prior to the event, we want to recognize the speakers for their con- tributions to the success of the con- ference, hosted by Philippe Piet van Putten. Speakers on Saturday in addi- tion to Mr. van Putten were Luciano Stancka E. Silva (Sao Paulo), Claudeir Covo (Sao Paulo), Marco Antonio Petit de Castro (Rio de Janeiro). Edison Boaventura, Jr. (Guaruja, S.P.). Carlos Alberto Machado (Curitiba, Parana). On Sun- day the speakers were Philippe Piet van Putten, Claudeir Covo, Ubirajara Franco Rodrigues (Varginha, M.G.), Alejandro C. Agostinelli (Buenos Aires, Argentina), and Walter H. An- drus, Jr. (Texas, U.S.A.). On Monday evening a special meeting was held at the Free Hotel titled \"Meet Walter Andrus\" where air- port control operators, military person- nel and key researchers were invited to attend an organizational meeting to pro- mote cooperation between military and civil UFO researchers. In 1992, addi- tional invitations will be extended to more international speakers such as Linda Moulton Howe and Bruce Maccabee. EDITOR, Continued I've allowed the published arguments to slip into personality confrontations, rather than confining them to the specific issues or facts at hand. I ac- cept those reprimands. All future submissions to the Jour- nal, then, should address the specifics at hand. Your arguments, if there are any, should be concerned with the available facts as you have them and your interpretation of same. They should not be played off against other individuals or interpretations. We've all stopped beating our wives and husbands! (Or if we haven't, I don't want to hear about it.) What personal comments will be allowed should be ad- dressed to the editor as a brief letter which may or may not appear in the \"Letters\" column. Finally, I hope I haven't scared anyone off as I certainly didn't mean to! In fact, the Journal welcomes your ac- tive participation. The fact that we now have over 3000 subscribers is testimony enough to our diversity of opinion. By the same token, please don't sit on your duff and expect the editor and staff to produce the best UFO journal you've ever read each and every month. We de- pend on you as much as you depend on us. We welcome submissions. Ideally they should be double-spaced for easy scanning or hand-correcting. Con- sultants in particular should share their particular expertise with the rest of us. Speculate and comment, please. At the same time, ironically, it is almost impossible for us to respond to everyone on an individual basis. If you've submitted an article or letter of comment in the past and it has yet to see print, please accept our apologies. As soon as we commit ourselves, it seems, something surfaces which makes a liar out of us. In the meantime, we're doing the best we can. And that's no lie.

Speakers already confirmed are Stanton T. Friedman (Canada) and Philippe Piet van Put ten (Brazil). MUFON Organization in Brazil After your Director attended and spoke at the 4th SUFOEX in Sao Paulo, Brazil on October 13, 1991. he had the privilege of meeting and evaluating a number of the leading UFO researchers in Brazil. Since Brazil has always been an important segment of worldwide Ufology, MUFON has recognized the need to organize Brazil by states similar to the U.S.A. Philippe Piet van Putten (Sao Paulo), formerly State Director for Sao Paulo, has been appointed the National Direc- tor for Brazil, due to his outstanding leadership, organizing ability and thoroughness as a competent UFO researcher. Cynthia Newby Luce (Sao Jose de Rio Preto) has been assigned as State Director for Sao Paulo. Ms. Luce was born and educated in the United States and has attended several MUFON UFO symposia. Ademan J. Gevaerd (Campo Grande) will con- tinue as the State Director for Mato Grosso Do Sul. Jose Victor Soares (Gravatay) is being relieved of his duties as State Director for Rio Grande Do Sul due to inactivity for reasons beyond his control. Your Director met numerous competent and enthusiastic UFO researchers during his visit to Brazil, who will soon be appointed State Direc- tors by Mr. van Putten. I was very im- pressed with the accomplishments of Philippe in Ufology. astronomy, ex- obiology, and his earned respect and ac- ceptance by the UFO community in southern Brazil. I am confident that Brazil will re-establish itself as one of the world leaders in Ufology under the guidance and direction of Mr. van Put- ten and his team of State Directors and Researchers. They have secured a degree of cooperation from the military that surpasses the U.S.A. and may be compared favorably to Belgium, Nor- way, the U.S.S.R. and France. New Officers As MUFON approaches 3,300 mem- bers worldwide, the need for grass roots leadership continues unabated and is being fulfilled daily. The following new State Section Directors assumed their new posts this past month. Larry and Marilyn Childs, Co-State Directors for Washington, selected Robert W. Ryan (Raymond, WA) for Pacific County; Clarence J. Sevdy (Everette, WA) for Snohomish County; and Daniel C. Hernandez (Yakima, WA) for Yakima County. Charles D. Flannigan, Florida State Director, made some organizational changes in Florida to strengthen his in- vestigative team by appointed Donald B. Flitman, M.D. (Coconut Grove, FL) to cover Dade County, replacing Virgilio Sanchez-Ocejo. (Your Direc- tor had the privilege of meeting with Don and Claudette Flitman in Miami during my recent flight to Brazil.) Vickie J. Johnson (Naples, FL) has been assigned Collier and Monroe Counties. James W. Moseley was reassigned as Assistant State Section Director for Monroe County. Daniel R. Berker, Nevada State Director, approved the appointments of Donald G. Tyson (Goldfield, NV) for Esmeralda and Nye Counties and Michael W. St. Clair (Fallen, NV) for Churchill County. Other new State Sec- tion Directors this month were Wan- da L. Sudrala (Belle Fourche, SD) for Butte, Harding and Lawrence Counties; Eric K. Byler (Salem, OR) for Polk County; and Urban E. Schaffner (Cox's Creek, KY) for Nelson. Washington and .Marion Counties. Consultants and Research Specialists Donald C. Nelson, Ph.D. (Custer, SD), a retired university professor, as a Consultant in Horticulture; Jameston S. Deveroux, Ph.D. (Hamden, CT) in Biology; Howard M. Schachter, Ph.D. (Nepean, Ontario) in Psychology; and Doris V. Bright, Ph.D. (Memphis, TN) in Sociology.
