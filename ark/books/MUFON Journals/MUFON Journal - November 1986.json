FROM THE EDITOR If your own subscription is about to lapse, or you're wondering what gift to get that special friend or librarian in your life, now is the time to renew, because you won't want to miss the next issue of the MUFON ; UFO Journal. In a dramatic preview of his anxiously awaited Communion, bestselling author Whitley Strieber reveals that his experiences with \"the visitors\" are still ongoing. His speculations about who, or what they might be, as well as his views on MUFON and its members, not to mention the skeptics, is sure to be one of the UFO highlights of the year. Remember where you read it first! Meanwhile, the issue in hand contains two updates on the recent Brazil cases, and a pair of meaty articles by our own Michael Swords and England's Jenny Randies. Stan Gordon looks at mystery meteors, and Jim Leming reveals new developments in the Great Falls, Montana, UFO film. Next month, besides the intriguing Strieber article, we'll also feature other viewpoints on the abduction phenomenon in general, undoubtedly the most provocative feature in all of Ufology.

By Michael D. Swords There are a lot of possible answers to the question in the title, ranging from \"there's nothing to it\" to \"we're too stupid to reason it out.\" Well, maybe ...both ways. But those answers are pretty unsatisfying to researchers close to the issues, and may not be the answers which make the most sense. There is an answer which makes at least as much sense, as it is supported by a trend of thinking outside Ufology entirely — the debate over the so-called Fermi Paradox. Named after Enrico Fermi, who years ago mythically scraped together some quick mathematics to estimate how fast ET civilizations could spread across the galaxy, the Paradox says: from all our science we would intuit that ETI is common and has been common in the galaxy for perhaps billions of years. But if so where are they? Why aren't they \"all over us\" and all other stars as well? Why wasn't the Solar System (and Earth) colonized hund- reds of millions of years ago? The argument goes on to reason that \"since no evidence of ETI exists in the Solar System\" (flatly rejecting UFOs), ETs must not be common or even present in the galaxy. Actually this conclusion is an odd leap in several ways. It could be an argument for No ETs, or for No Space-travelling ETs, or for No ETs who Colonize, or for No ETs who Space-travel and also wish to reveal themselves, or for No ETs who Space-travel and want to interfere, etc. etc. SPACE TRAVEL Pursuing this idea may not be a waste of our time. The Fermi Paradox (\"lots of Ets, but none apparent\"?) has been reworked by negativists such as Michael Hart and Eric Jones, and by Frank Tipler. In the Hart-Jones formulation, they extrapolate from current technology and decide (as do all other thinkers on this) that interstellar travel should be tough, but not so tough as to be un-doable, or even particularly daunting. Note well folks: the theorists are offering support here for the possibility of interstellar ET craft (UFOs if you wish, or the bigger vessels which carry them). Now, they (Hart and Jones) rapidly and correctly come to the conclusion that it doesn't really matter much how fast your \"ship\" goes (speed of light, 10% C, whatever, as long as it's \"pretty\" fast). The key of \"overrunning\" the galaxy is how long ETs hang around in one system before making the big effort to hop to the next. It also makes a difference how many simultaneous . stellar voyages you send out (i.e. how many new systems you try to hop to from the same home base at the same time). Hart and Jones juggle these \"stay times\" and \"numbers of simultaneous target stars per base,\" and conclude that, yep, Fermi was right. ET should have colonized the whole galaxy long, long ago. An inspection of their reasoning process (Hart's and Jones') reveals a surprising alternative\" view. What they try to do is assume a certain process governing \"stay times\" (we'll roast them on this later) and then a certain rate of expansion to govern the simultaneous number of targets per base. This second \"guess\" is a big deal in the result. If one assumes that the home system colonizes two systems, then four, then 8, 16, 32, etc....this \"turtle\" approach \"never\" gets around to all 400 billion stars (given any. reasonable scenario parameters), and there's no Fermi \"problem.\" Hart and Jones feel that some pace of expansion between the \"rabbit\" and the \"turtle\" mentioned above is more likely: a random diffusive expansion wave of some sort, like a \"factorial\" function (one goes to two, they go to three, the three colonize four more, etc.). Well, it's a guess loaded with assumptions, but let's let them have it for the moment. You can take expansion waves of a factorial type and show that you can expand to 200 to 400 billion hops rather rapidly, as Fermi intuited. If you say that the expansion is \"random\" (i.e. now it's expanding here, now, there, now somewhere else), you have subtlely introduced a model of the space which you are filling up. It is a sphere; a sphere with 400 billion randomly distributed targets and your original expander civilization at the center. And for that \"galaxy,\" the factorial wave fills it up far quicker than the age available to do so. But we all know that our galaxy \"just ain't that way.\" It is a highly flattened disk with lots of structure internally. What this means is that any random wave is going to run out of stars in many directions rather rapidly (all the \"up\" and \"down\" ones, for instance). In these directions the \"power\" of the wave goes to zero, and you are left limping along elsewhere at a much slower pace. The point of this is that you can take the argument of the primary negativists and \"play their game\" right alongside them, and come to the conclusion that the time for ET expansion in the galaxy could well be about the same as the time available for that expansion. Translation: the argument might conclude that we would expect \"them\" to be arriving any \"moment\" now. Once again the argument against ET can turn out to be an argument for UFOs or even ancient astronauts. MOTIVATION So on we go...quite delighted that all these anti-ETers are creating such a strong pro-UFO argument for us. The \"other\" part of the Fermi Game is \"motivation\" — why are the ETIs going to the stars, and how does that determine their \"stay times\" before (continued next page)"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"CONFUSING, Continued hopping outward? Well, the safest answer is \"who knows,\" but let's look at the published debate so far. Hart and Jones decide that \"overpopulation\" is the answer, almost the wierdest motive that they could have come up with. My guess is that they chose this motive because it gave 'them a method for approximating -\"stay-times:\" i.e. how long do you need to explode your population and then move on? OK, nice try, but nonsense. . Imagine a system groaning under the weight of a trillion .people, and getting relief of some sort by sending out a colony of 500. And, more cogently, all our hi-tech Earth cultures have turned their population curves over; only the third world is still multiplying like crazy. There's a lot of incentive for an educated, well-off healthy population not to explode. Advanced civilizations will feel no population pressure whatsoever. So that kind of colonization makes no sense. What else is there? Military or commercial expansion? Total nonsense unless Interstellar Travel is like calling a taxi — that is, if star-to- star is a significant expense and effort, then it's a lot easier to extensively exploit your own system. Pragmatics, in fact, make no sense in general as a motive, unless it involves the ultimate pragmatic, survival (of which more later). So, we need something \"irrational,\" \"idealistic,\" \"romantic\" to drive ET outward, or we need a survival issue. One can imagine two such irrational drives, religion and curiosity. (Other drives are imagineable, but not coherent with a civilization organized enough to produce such a project; ex. paranoias, phobias, Apocalyptic revelations,...in fact, it is somewhat difficult to picture a religious drive so emotionally powerful in a hi-tech organized society, which would require mission \"work to other stars...unless, again, such trips are very easy). It seems that wonder, curiosity, exploration is what we're got to work with. Frank Tipler felt this way and built his anti-ET argument on that ground. He stated that no rational intelligences would send themselves to the stars, but would instead send self-replicating intelligent robots (Von Neumann Machines) who would relentlessly follow their general program of travel, exploration, self-replication, travel, exploration etc. until they filled the galaxy. Ergo, \"since we see no Von Neumann Machines around, there's no ET.\" Once again we have been treated to especially bizarre assumptions. All sorts of problesm exist with Tipler's idea (Carl Sagan and William Newman have pointed out several), but the worst of them is simply .why would any ET send machines to ramble all over the galaxy when they could never get any benefit for any but the closest parts of their project? You can imagine the ET Space Science Council saying to themselves, \"let's spend several trillion bucks to send these independent robots into space even though we won't hear, from 99.9999 + % of them — heck, it'll be fun just knowing that we've littered the galaxy with our junk. And if we're lucky, the, program might even get so out of hand that a hoard of them will come back here and destroy our system's viability by their insatiable resource demands.\" - Great idea. But what do we get out of it other than that the negativists have screwed up again? Well, it has focussed the discussion on two possible motives for ET exploration: curiosity and survival. And in motivation lies potential explanation when you're trying to study UFOs. What have we got so far? 1.) A whole thrust of our own Earth science which seems to indicate that extraterrestrial intelligence should be commonplace; 2.) A variety of viewpoints and designs which seem to indicate that interstellar travel should be possible, albeit difficult (i.e. a sincere effort); 3.) Galactic travel scenarios which could have a likely arrival of ET anytime in recent past or foreseeable future; 4.) A likely motivation for travel of scientific exploration and/or survival. SPACE DWELLERS Michael Papagiannis, Boston University Astronomy Professor, has made very cogent arguments that such ET visitor-explorers would be so comfortable as a space-dwelling civilization that they would choose to set up housekeeping in colony-research structures in space, rather than on planetary surfaces. The likely choice is the asteroid belt for all sorts of reasons: raw metals, water, carbonaceous materials, everything you need (except your \"home\" gene-banks) to build a civilization. , • If an ET exploring group were permanently set up in the asteroid belt, or wherever, no longer can any objection about \"too. many UFOs\" crossing interstellar space be made. All we see are the mini-research vehicles which commute back-and-forth from the base-colony. Such explorers would \"drop-in\" any time their research programs called for it on Planet Three, and the bulk of the work would be \"back in the lab.\"They would then send their findings to home system by some method...maybe not radio. In Papagiannis' own words: \"Supporting the existence of space colonies in our solar system are the many UFO sightings continuously reported in the press, though none of them has ever been scientifically verified to correspond to an alien spacecraft. If, however, there is any substance to any of these reports, it would certainly make more sense if all these alien spacecraft would be flying out from space colonies within our solar system rather than crossing interstellar distances of many light years just to pay us a short visit. \"If the galaxy has already been colonized, this cosmic event must have happened hundreds of millions or even billions of years ago and therefore all these stellar colonies must have reached a steady state existence a very long time ago. For such advanced societies, which probably have also reached some level of immortality, changes would be infrequent and therefore time would pass much slower than it does in our own fast changing world. To them the earth for millions of years must have seemed a rather uninteresting abode of primitive life that was still -worth preserving for evolutionary studies or as a zoo. \"In the last century, things started suddenly to happen. Radio (continued next page)"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"CONFUSING, Continued \"r communications, airplanes, nuclear bombs, satellites, missions to other planets, are all activities which could have not gone unnoticed. If indeed they exist in the asteroid belt they can no longer ignore us, because with our spacecraft crossing the asteroid belt on their way to Jupiter and Saturn and with our large arsenals of megaton , nuclear weapons we could even be a direct threat to them: It is conceivable, therefore, that faced with such a sudden technological explosion they are still holding back trying to decide whether we represent some kind of a cosmic disease that must be destroyed before it spreads, or some promising youngsters that ought to be helped to join an already well established galactic society.\" (Papagiannis, 1983) Papagiannis' comments bring up the topic of \"survival.\" Charles Pelligrino of Adelphi University gave a disturbing presentation at the 1986 AAAS meeting during a day-long session on Interstellar Travel and Communication. Pelligrino compared relativistic space-craft with Samuel Colt's six-gun. As Colt's gun \"made all men equal,\" the relativistic rocket (a \"planet-cracker\" as he phrased it) makes all technical civilizations equal in their ability to devastate the other. Established civilizations might well be very concerned about \"other guys\" emerging into this sort of technology. They might want to \"seek\" them out without themselves being overtly revealed. They might want to monitor them very closely, especially their mental stability, violence, xenophobia, and general psychology. They might, if especially lenient in their attitude, try to gradually acclimate the new group to the more advanced \"unknown.\" If not lenient, they'd take no chances. Whereas I'm not especially comfortable with this scenario, it doesn't seem at all impossible...and could even explain much. ET RESEARCH Backing off the Papagiannis-plus- Pelligrino picture, now what might we surmise? An established extraterrestrial civilization sends out explorer-colonies motivated by two primeval drives: curiosity and survival. They set up a base in the solar system, probably in the asteroid belt, and begin to explore (this could have been recently or well-past). Although the whole system is a research treasure-trove, Planet Three is special because of its life ecology and intelligent life form. Elaborate research ^programs are set up with several goals: 1.) Basic research on the entire system; 2.) in-depth knowledge of human physiology; 3.) in-depth knowledge of human psychology; 4.) maintenance of secrecy while still allowing in-depth research (requiring direct interactions);. 5.) possibly, acclimatization of humanity to themselves. There is an in-built tension in the plan. Work must go on. . Not only knowledge, but perhaps life and death decisions are on the line. But the work must be secret, or at least unbelieved. No abortive too-early fixation of the terrestrial intelligences must be focussed on the existence of themselves and the possible position of their home world. They are researchers on a mission of the potentially greatest import, the monitoring and evaluation of an extremely dangerous intelligent life form (us). MIND GAMES We're not that bad, we think. But we really are, aren't we? We get our act together occasionally, and most of us seem fairly under control, and if the picture above is correct, that- may be what saves iis. If our observers are relatively benign but still seriously concerned, how would you expect them to proceed? They'd play the game with as much control as possible — single, or few, manipulated \"specimens,\" on their own turf, relatively cool and objective, certainly not overly affectionate, intense, serious, not totally lacking care, but risking nothing, and deliberately spreading the maximum confusion to cover their trail. But why the apparent \"mind- games?\" The \"display,\" the \"staged messing around?\" The \"meaningless absurdities?\" Have you ever wondered what a rat might think in a psychology experiment? Human psychology and mental stability is a big factor in the master equation our observers would be trying to figure out. How logical is a Rorschach test, after all? When it's all said, does any of the above make sense? It certainly doesn't proue anything. It is a vision almost entirely a posteriori. But it has a few points of attraction. It is a view which grows naturally from the scientists discussing ETI outside/independent of UFOIogy. It is therefore a reasonable extension of current thought. It also explains a lot of the UFO Phenomenon, including the increase in sightings at a critical time in our technological development, and a constellation of human-focussed and \"absurd\", confusing actions. It \"predicts\" that we are in for more of the same, with perhaps a slow acclimatization process (if we're lucky) or a sudden violent decision (if we're not). Is the idea entirely balderdash? It could be surely. The ETs cluttering the galaxy could be blocked from getting here, or they could be totally cocky and unconcerned about us, and all the UFO phenomenon could have other surprising explanations. Fine, let's hope we find out. Till then let's also keep open the possibility in no way refuted by any established fact or theory mentioned above. Speculative or not, it has the virtue of explaining a lot of the mystery in this business.

Antonio Huneeus Antonio Huneeus is a New York-based journalist and frequent contributor to the Journal. Brazil's air defense system went on \"automatic alert\" the night of May 19, 1986. Twenty-one \"uncorrelated targets\" were detected for hours on the radar screens of Air Force bases and airports that belong to CINDACTA. This is the Integrated Air Defense & Air Traffic Control Center for Brazil and the whole episode was disclosed publicly by the Air Force Minister himself. Brig. Gen. Octavio Moreira Lima stated, \"we haven't the slightest intention of hiding anything from the press.\" At his press conference in Brasilia, he declared that six fighter jets — three F-5E's and three Mirages — were scrambled from the Santa Cruz and Anapolis AF Bases. The \"radar blips\" were visually confirmed by most of the pilots and various chases took place. The first witnesses were Col. Osiris Silva, the President of Petrobras (state oil conglomerate) and pilot Alcir Pereira. Around 9 pm on May 19, they were preparing to land their Xingu executive jet at the airport of Sao Jose dos Campos in the state of Sao Paulo when they were informed by the Control Tower that three unidentified flying objects were on their route. Pereira and Silva attempted, to intercept the objects, which appeared as \"strong red lights not at all like stars or planes, which changed their positions rapidly.\" The speed of the UFOs was estimated at between 150 to 600 miles per hour. INTERCEPTORS F-5E fighter jets were immediately scrambled from the Santa Cruz AFB in Rio as the radar system became clogged with \"unknown returns.\" At 10 pm, more fighter jets were scrambled from the Anapolis AFB in Goias state BRAZILIAN RADAR ROOM Credit J Antonio Huneeus after visual contact was established by the pilots of the F-5E's. The second flight consisted of three Mirages armed with Sidewinders and Mattra Missiles. CINDACTA'S Chief of Operations, Major Ney Siqueiros, characterized the blips as \"unidentified movements... I'd never seen anything similar.\" Not only did the pilots see the objects, they also chased them and in some cases, were chased by the lights. Capt. Jordao was 12 miles away from a target \"constantly changing colors from white to green.\" His F-5E chased the object to the coast until it passed Brazil's 200-mile sea limit. Lt. Kleber's F-5E followed another UFO which was estimated by both ground and aircraft radar to be about 35 miles away. The lieutenant described it as \"a very intense red light which changed colors to white, then green and again red.\" When his fuel began to run out he was forced to return to the base. The most sensational experience occurred to Capt. Freitas as thirteen luminous balls surrounded his Mirage III; they were distributed in groups of six and seven objects on each side of his plane. Capt. Freitas testified that \"ground control warned me of ten to thirteen 'contacts' which were approaching my plane; they came on until I was told that they were following behind me at a distance of 2 miles.\" His only visual contact occurred when the lights \"started to climb vertically up to 33,000 feet.\" PRESS CONFERENCE The incident became Brazil's top news story of the week. Making good his promise of full disclosure to the press, Air Force Minister Lima allowed all the pilots and radar officers involved that night to appear at a press conference in Brasilia. Because of its scope and impact in terms of both air defense and public relations, this case (continued on page 15)"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"BRAZILIAN BRIEFING By Irene Granchi Irene Granchi is a veteran Brazilian UFO investigator. \"\"Unidentified Movements\" -.this is how Ney Siqueira labeled the Unidentified Flying Objects (in the strict sense of the word) in his TV report given on May 21st, 1986. Ney Siqueira is President of CINDACTA (Centre Integrado de Defesa Aerea e de Controle de Trafego Aereo - integrated Centre of Air Defence and Air Traffic Control) and declared that \"In Sao Jose dos Campos, Air Traffic Control had shown a cramming of echoes on radar and the pilot of a plane in the air had received the message and was the first to see, visually, lights which remained visible for 200 miles, when the pilot lost touch.\" The plane, a Xingu was none other than that of Osires Silva, the newly appointed President of Petrobras, who for many years was also President of EMBRAER (Empress Brasileira de Aeronautical). With his pilot Commander Alcir, he was about to land when they were given notice by the Control Tower and lifted off once more; they watched white, green and red lights flying from 250 to 1000 km per hour. Please note that each quote given here is recorded directly from live interviews . on TV and not from newspapers. But the Press, in general, has faithfully reported the facts. . \"Simultaneously,\" Ney Siqueira went on to say, \"We had contacts by radar from the Air Defence system and from the controls at the Santa Cruz Air Base, which caused aerial action to be taken and the scrambling of F.A.B. (Brazilian Air Force) planes from the Anapolis Base so as to reconnoitre these unidentified movements.\" A reporter asked, \"Would the Air Force define these as being Unidentified Flying Objects?\" Ney replied, \"We do. not possess sufficient technical-operated means to be able to state that they are Unidentified Flying Objects. Simply said, using the technical means we have and because of the fighter planes used for interception by the Air Force, we follow the principle that they are Unidentified Aerial Movements.\" ' ., \"Was the length and trajectory of these objects checked?\" \"No, 'no type or shape of these objects was checked for this happened at night:\" This statement was made oh Wednesday 21st May on the second TV Newsreel, Manchete.  .. Oh the same night, the Air Force minister Octavio Moreira Lima, made a short statement and on the next day he • gave a. Press interview which commenced with 1 ' laughter, when he confessed that ever since his childhood he had hoped to see' a Flying Saucer. But, he added that it is not a matter of belief and that he could only furnish technical 'information. \"Technically, there is no explanation,\" the Minister said. \"We shall obtain the CINDACTA reports.. We haveri't the slightest intention of hiding anything from the Press.\" \"What is your position?\" he was asked. ' : \"I do not know...it's very difficult for us to say. An object...well, we do not have an explanation...it could be, let's say, a matter of electronic warfare. It could be... interference on radar...but this is a hypothesis. Electronic warfare that I'm talking about is ' mere speculation. There are many interferences. ' Radar detects metal objects, solid surfaces and masse ; s with heavy lights. It reflects. These are the three speculations. Under the circumstances when the phenomenon occurred, the sky was entirely clear. When the lights were monitored, there were no airships in the sky.\" The newsreel (TV Globo) of the 22nd May, interviewed pilot Commander Oto of Brasilia, who said he had seen, in the early hours of the 20th May, while flying from Sao Luiz of Maranhao to Brasilia, \"an object that looked like a ping-pong ball. It seemed not to reflect, but to have a light of its own. It followed my plane for about 700 km and flew at 40,000 ft., about 14 km. Over Porto Nacional it was flying to my left, near Salvador, Bahia.\" Another comment was made by Minister -Osiris Silva who, after taking office as Petrobras President, said, \"It. didn't look anything like the Flying Saucers seen in publications. It was a circular light and it registered on radar.\" Finally the Air Force stood down the pilots, all of them veterans, who had been scrambled on the night of May 19th, and they were allowed to give a Press Conference. Each of the seven pilots present had the opportunity to give his own version of what he had watched between May 19 and 20. Three F -5 fighter jets were sent up from Sao Jose dos Campos and three Mirage jets from Anapolis, Goias. The lights seen were white, green and red. Speed noted was between 250 and 1500 km per hour. Twenty-one lights were observed altogether. At the Press Conference, one of the pilot's said, \"I watched a very bright, red light.\" The other said, \"I watched three lights, a green one, a red one, and a white one - the white one prevailed.\" \"I watched the lights in front and on each side of my radar screen. I speeded up to 1500 km per hour and managed to close in on the light to 6 miles from my radar, but from that moment on I was unable to approach, closer.'\"  • Pilot Kleber declared, \"I approached up to 12 miles which was the same distance that the. Central Tower was giving.\" The Air Ministry declared immediately after the pilots finished reporting that ho more would be said on (continued on page 9) .7"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"MYSTERY METEORS By Stan Gordon Observations of meteors are indeed quite common and can be made on almost any clear night. The MUFON Field Investigators Manual describes a meteor as gravitationally attracted pieces of matter burning up by friction in our Earth's atmosphere. It goes on to say that most sightings of meteors are described as a streak of light, or a short- lived, fast-moving, star-like object with a fiery trail behind it. Sightings of extra-ordinarily bright meteors are known as Bolides or fireballs, and are rare in comparison to normal meteor observations. These bolides can appear as a large brilliant round or elongated object, which can leave a long luminous trail in the sky for a considerable period of time. A bolide can display brilliant colors normally red, white, green,' blue and yellow or combinations of these colors. These fireballs can at times be observed over a large, geographical area, possibly extending over a thousand square-mile area or more. It is not uncommon to have a sonic boom associated with the passing of a fireball. What is uncommon is when these fireballs are reported year after year, in a small section of the United States. During the years from 1947 to 1949, there was a rash of sightings of green fireballs in Northern New Mexico. The objects looked similar to meteors, except for their trajectory, apparent slow movement and localized sighting locations. The Air Force, in fact, set up Project Twinkle to conduct a study of these observations. But throughout UFO history, similar \"mystery meteors\" have shown up in many parts of the world. The mystery meteor phenomena may have never stopped, but because of the natural appearance of these objects the reports have been overlooked. As I and other writers have previously published, there is indication that unexplainable UFO sightings in some instances have occurred at 8 almost the same time and in the same location where a scientifically explainable UFO such as the re-entry of space debris or a natural meteor was reported. We could speculate here the possibility that if UFOs are indeed intelligently controlled, then they could be using this \"natural cover\" to hide their operations. An even more complex question now.arises: Could some fireball meteors . actually be disguised UFOs? Here in Pennsylvania, our PASU unit (the Pennsylvania Association for the Study of the Unexplained) investigates hundreds of alleged UFO sightings every year. While recently working on the files and updating the . computer listings, it became apparent that for the last 6 years (since 1981) some rather strange fireball sightings had been occurring and without our having kept records of these incidents, the phenomenon would have not been noticed. First I must explain that most meteor observations are indeed natural in origin. We have received numerous meteor and bolide reports over the years, but what caught our eye is that the reports which we mention here were all reported for 6 years sequentially, all occurred in January or February, and all took place in either Eastern or Western Pennsylvania, and appeared to have been seen in a specific geographical area. In three of the cases, Jan. 12, 1982, Jan. 28, 1984 and Feb. 15, 1986, the sightings occurred in Eastern Pa., and into the New Jersey and Delaware border. The chronological listing of these events are as follows: 1.) January 1, 1981-Many reports of a bright fireball in the sky during the afternoon over Western Pennsylvania. A loud boom apparently associated with the passage of the object was heard from Allegheny to Warren County. 2.) January 12,1982-Shortly before 7 PM, a bluish-green fireball was seen in Eastern Pa., into Central and Northern New Jersey. PASU filed a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request with Coast Guard Atlantic City, N.J. who had conducted a search for the object. According to documents released to us by the Coast Guard, \"three witnesses saw a plane or object crash into the ocean and go aflame off of Harrison Avenue, Atlantic City\". According to one press report, the object stayed afloat on the water and burned for 10 minutes before sinking. The search of the area turned up no evidence. 3.) January, 1983 (occurred during the first week)-At about 6 AM a bright green and red fireball was seen North of Harrisburg moving over the Susquehanna, River. We received information that the day after the incident numerous military helicopters were seen in a search pattern over the area of the sightings. 4.) January 28, 1984-At 6:50 PM, . many witnesses observed a bright green and red ball of fire moving from Eastern Penn. to Northern New Jersey. The sighting was reported by police, air traffic controllers and the public. One witness reported to PASU, that as the object passed over the hydro- electric plant near Faith Harbor, PA that a strong sulphur smell was apparent. 5.) February 7, 1984-At 3:30 AM, state and municipal police officers in parts of York, Dauphin, and Cumberland Counties in Pennsylvania, observed the passage of a bright ball of fire in the sky emitting sparks. A check was made for downed aircraft, but this was not the case. The sighting reports appear to have been confined to that immediate area. 6.) January 20, 1985-At 9:15 PM, a bright green fireball was seen moving through the sky near Jeanette, PA in Westmoreland County. Reports of sonic booms accompanied the observation. 7.) February 1, 1984-At 9:10 PM,"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"many calls were received on the PASU UFO Hotline concerning an orange and white fireball with a long tail moving, through Westmoreland County. 8.) February 15, 1986-The most recent \"mystery meteor\" occurred sometime after 3 AM, when many observers sighted a multi-colored ball of fire in Eastern Pennsylvania, Southern New Jersey and Delaware. PASU received a number of inquiries concerning the object and interviewed witnesses who claim to have seen fragments fall from the object as it moved across the sky. PASU filed FOIA requests with .several agencies who were involved with this incident. The Coast Guard responded with numerous documents verifying the reports. According to one of the reports \"The Fire Chief of Lower Alloways Creek Fire Rescue notified base (Coast . Guard Glouchester City, N.J.) that they-had received a report from —-- who was near .the power plant at Artificial Island, that he saw a red flare .and heard an explosion. New Castle County police notified-base reporting similar sightings by local residents. Base contacted Chester County police dispatch and verified reports by police . officers in Chester, Montgomery and Delaware County, Pa. of unexplained lights arching across the sky. New Castle County, Delaware also had reports of red lights across the sky, muffled explosions and buildings shaking\". A Coast Guard memo indicated that \"Dover Tower saw a bluish shooting star at the same time and direction as the others reported.\" I filed an FOIA request with Dover Air Force Base, Delaware, for any information concerning the sighting of the object. A March 26,1986 response to this request stated \"all documents, reports, logs and tapes have been reviewed for information concerning the incident in question. In addition individuals on duty during the time of the stated incident have been questioned. This office has no information available on the reported • incident of February 15, 1986\".   • : In all of the instances mentioned since 1984,1 have attempted to rule out re-entry of space debris by making direct contact with the NORAD Space Command Center in Colorado. NORAD after checking could not find any such correlation with the sightings mentioned. PASU, which has a strong input for UFO information across the state, also checked to see if there may have been other sightings that went unreported in areas where the passing object should have been sequentially sighted, but found that at least no such reports had been furnished to any law enforcement or news agency. Each year there are annual meteor showers, and multiple bright meteors are more likely to be seen during this time. But I am curious as to why these \"mystery meteors\" seem to isolate themselves by appearing within specific geographical borders, year after year? BRAZILIAN, Continued the matter until the Special Commission investigating the OVNIs (UFOs) reach their conclusions. The Commission, under the Command of Aerial.Defence, declare that there is no date marked for disclosing these results. But another pilot made a statement, Francisco Hugo Freitas: \"As I was nearing Sao Jose dos Campos, 1 was warned by Ground- control that there were several contacts ahead of me, approximately 20 miles distant. An average of from ten to thirteen contacts. I was also warned that the contacts were approaching my plane, and they came on until I was told that they were following behind me at a distance of 2 miles. I had to lower my plane, for the lights had descended, and from that moment on they started to climb vertically. This was my visual contact. Then on my radar I watched it 12 miles ahead of me. This spot light moved to 33,000 ft.\" Another pilot said he observed from his F-5 a spot of light on radar, and then echoes of light at the tail of another plane with 6 or 7 echoes on each side of the airship. \"Does this mean that the plane was pursued?\" asked the reporter. \"Yes, because for a certain amount of time, these echoes accompanied the F-5.\" This pilot added, \"There were thirteen lights altogether, six to the'left and seven to the right of the plane.\" The chase by the FAB planes lasted three hours until the lights were lost to sight at beyond 200 miles from the Brazilian coast, where the planes would have been outside Brazilian territory. ASSESSMENT I decided to transcribe from my tape-recorder the verbatim reports made by different persons involved in this experience with UFOs, and I wish to point out that this is the first time an Air Force Minister has spoken publicly to report UFO events that had just happened. Robert Galley, French Defence Minister, went on TV some years ago, but limited himself to revealing what had been going on in France, not UFO encounters in the limelight of that moment. The Brazilian Air Minister also acted courageously in presenting the pilots involved on TV, so that sensation-seeking listeners could be told in simple, straightforward language what had actually happened. But the story does not end here! There has been a plethora of UFO sightings in other regions of Brazil. Strange to say though, the program Fantastico (presented on Sunday 25 .May) once more .tried to debunk all the UFO sightings, with interviews by so- called scientists trying to prove that the spots on radar were caused by meteorite showers from the comet Halley (!) or seismjcal disturbances under-ground. The same program showed all the Air Force declarations I have presented above and held interviews with Prof. Flavio Pereira, Comm. Britto and myself.

Leming' ' . Since moving to Great Falls, Montana in 1982, this author and staff. artist for the MUFON UFO Journal has had the opportunity to conduct further investigations . into the famous/ infamous Nick Mariana/Great Falls, Montana motion picture film depicting two .round objects flying near a local baseball park. (There is debate between the Condon Committee and the Air Force Project Blue Book as to -.whether the date in question was the fifth or the fifteenth of August 1950. .However, there is concurrence on the location and presence of the objects since they were, filmed passing behind ' an existing water tower.) The Great Falls, Montana and Tremoriton, Utah motion picture films were analyzed by specialists assigned to the Air Force Project Blue Book, then submitted to the Robertson Panel (1953) as the two .best pieces of photographic evidence available to date. The Panel consisted of the late H.P. Robertson, Chairman; Samuel A. Goudsmit, Luis W. Alvarez, Thornton Page, and Lloyd V. Berkner, founding father of the IGY — International Geophysical Year. It was this panel's task to study and evaluate the sighting reports on their own merit. Considering that at the formation of the panel, the study' of UFOs had only a four and a half year history, it was quite conceivable that a gathering of such minds would only need a week or so to complete the study. These photo images were also studied by Dr. R.M.L. Baker, Jr., at that time of Computer Sciences, Inc., for the \"Condon Committee\" at the University of Colorado. A post-filming investigation into the personal and social life of Nicholas Mariana, Sr., recently disclosed some rather startling facts after 36 years of silence. (Editor's Note: The author is hereby sharing previously unknown information with the Mutual UFO Network so that future research might 10 continue elsewhere — possibly i Portland, Oregon. MUFON cannot vouch for the veracity of the facts disclosed, however 'we (MUF.ON) do rely upon the author as a persistent, dedicated and ethical investigator.) It appears that the Mariana film gained considerable weight as evidence , after the reopening of the Blue Book investigations in 1952. , (Quotations from The Report on Unidentified Flying Objects by the late Captain Edward J. Ruppelt will be included later in this article.) The Mariana film created enough interest to prompt the visit of two Air Force officers from nearby Malmstrom AFB, a Strategic . Air Command (SAC) installation in Great Falls, to Mr.; Mariana's home in November of 1952. These officers came to see Mariana with some very pointed requests. These \"responses\" would not be known today :were it not for the testimony of a \"friend-of-a-friend\" and a babysitter whose father worked closely with Mariana. VISIT It was a week-night in November, 1952, when Mr. L.M. (name on file with MUFON) was visiting with his long-time close friend, Nick Mariana, at the latter's home. They were enjoying something to drink and discussing the day's events when a knock was heard at the front door. When Mariana opened the front door, L.M. could plainly see an Air Force colonel and a major illuminated by the porchlight. They introduced themselves and asked permission to enter, stating that they had \"matters to discuss\" with Mariana and promised to be brief. L.M. excused himself and went to the kitchen to refresh their drinks. While in the kitchen (only eight feet away from those . in the living room) L.M. overheard the following conversation: .. .\"In exchange for a loss of interest in your film, we (the Air Force) are willing to assist you in accomplishing the following:' ; 1.) All expenses.paid re-location to a city of your choice for you and surviving members of your family! 2.) A job within the government structure on full payroll with benefits. •3.) $10,000 in cash...\" NEW JOB As. a result .of this nocturnal visit, Nick 'seemed to indeed lose interest in his film, and ., very rarely even acknowledged its existence. Within two months he had re-located to Portland, Oregon, accepted a job with the Forest Service (Dept.. of'the Interior), arid deposited a very large sum. of money into a .local bank account. All of. the above-mentioned points can be verified with the exception of the exact dollar amount mentioned. If Mariana shook his head, in'either the affirmative or negative, L.M: could not determine from his vantage point in the kitchen. This is the first case of government/military coercion and bribery that has been substantiated by independent witnesses that this author is aware of. (It is regrettable that this conversation was not tape recorded. An unfortunate oversight but as the interview was almost accidental in nature, better preparation was not available. Steps to correct this problem are being pursued through additional testimony.) • The Project Blue Book staff considered the Great Falls, Montana and Tremonton, Utah films to be the highest quality photographic evidence available to date. The best military photo labs in the country were used 'to examine the footage: the Air Force Photographic Laboratory at Wright Field in Ohio (Wright-Patterson AFB), and the Naval Photographic Laboratory at Anacostia, Maryland.

I thought American readers might like to count their blessings at having a \"Freedom of Information Act\", and contrast things with Great Britain — where state policy on UFOs is dominated (as are many things) by secrecy. An anecdotal account of government interest in UFOs might supplement the Yorkshire UFO Society report on the Churchill papers recently published in the Journal. We do not know when investigations began — probably with the Air Ministry (the forerunner of what is now the Ministry of Defence — MoD). But we do have quite a number of examples of first-hand reports from military personnel (mostly airmen, radar operators, etc.) who were involved with encounters in the first ten years of the UFO mystery and say there was an official investigation, personal interrogation, etc. Yet no files exist on these matters. Typical is the classic radar-visual case discovered thirty years after it had happened and reported by one of the alleged 12 witnesses, then a Sargeant in the RAF and acting as a wireless operator on a training mission. It was late May 1948 at about 11:40 am — broad daylight. DISC SPOTTED Sargeant Jones was in a York transport aircraft accompanied by six Meteor jets that were all due to fly from RAF Tangmere in Sussex to RAF Acklington in Northumberland, where a firing practice exercise regularly took place into the North Sea. The journey is of about 350 miles. They were one-third of the way into the trip (near Bicester, north of Oxford) when \"a small 12 m ! \\mm- \\ \"i\\: iWMv l£-& v^^rv\"'7>V,:>x; ^£.V£v\"- , JENNY RANDLES Dennis Stacy stationary silver disc was spotted in the sky above us. Everybody saw it at the same time — we communicated by radio telephone.\" He was able to watch it through 6x30 Barr and Stroud binoculars. At the time they were flying at 10,000 ft. and this thing was at 25,000 ft. — although that was a figure given later when the ground radar tracking was learned. Two of the Meteors had oxygen equipment and scrambled for a closer look — but \"they never got close — the UFO took off from literally a standing start\". The radar measured this as 1500 MPH — needless to say way beyond aircraft capacity at that time. Upon landing at Acklington they were separated and asked to complete a written account, then advised to \"keep your mouths shut\". Of the witnesses he says that three had flown in the Battle of Britain, one was a Squadron Leader and another was an American, Major Robin Olds, who later became General he believes. The only reason his name was recalled is that he married a Hollywood film star (Ella Raines) — and she came to visit his base at Tangmere a few times. In terms of British investigation this case is a dead duck. The MoD do not have a record (they say) and any letters to base commanders simply get routed to the MoD! Did Project Blue Book (or Sign as it then was) record it? I doubt it — but possibly Freedom of Information requests will reveal something. I conveyed details to MUFON some time ago and hope you are successful. DOG FIGHT According to Ruppelt's The Report on UFOs (published in 1956 and still one of the best UFO books ever written in my view) he was given information in 1952/1953 by RAF intelligence officers who visited him at Blue Book. They asked questions and indicated that the British government currently interested in taking was (continued next page)"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"FREEDOM, Continued UFOs seriously. He believed that incidents which occurred during \"Operation Mainbrace\" — a NATO exercise in the North Sea during September 1952 — were primarily responsible. Three separate encounters are described by Ruppelt — including photographs taken by a photographer on a U.S. vessel. Meteor jets also twice encountered objects, once over the sea and once over Topcliffe Airfield in Yorkshire. The final sighting (a typical aerial dogfight rather like the George Gorman case — except this was in daylight!) has been investigated to some extent by me. It certainly is real; although Ruppelt's stated date must be a day or so in error, as it was reported the day before he alleges it happened. Once again no MoD records on these matters supposedly exist! Against this sort of background Churchill made his enquiries and there were pro-UFO statements by leading officials — e.g. Air Marshall Lord Dowding (who headed the RAF during World War II). (Churchill, incidentally, seems to have been the first politician to evidence a serious concern about UFOs — asking questions in the House of Commons when he was Admiral of the Fleet in 1913! This, of course, was over the spate of \"mystery airships\" then being seen across Britain). The Magazine FSR (F/ying Saucer Review) was founded by airmen and accumulated one or two stories from 1955 on involving RAF pilots. So there was deep concern amongst this fraternity in the mid-fifties. By now the MoD was formulated, and they were admittedly observing UFOs (both literally and from a data collection point of view). Whilst nothing from this time officially survives, Ralph Noyes — who was on the staff of the Air Minister at the time — tells us that there was a lot of talk and communication across the Atlantic — especially in the wake of the July 1952 Washington D.C. sightings — although the USAF explanation as \"temperature inversions\" was, on the surface accepted. LAKENHEATH Then — in August 1956 — came the now famous RAF Lakenheath/ Bentwaters radar-visuals, which baffled the Condon evaluation (even though Blue Book conveniently forgot to bring it to their attention and they had to discover it by accident!). Ground sightings, airborne lock-ons by a Vampire jet, sightings from above looking down by a USAF transport plane and several independant radar trackings all figure in this case which Noyes remembers clearly — saying it deeply worried the corridors of Whitehall. Yet, according to the MoD, no records of it survive, and were in fact destroyed five years afterwards (in 1961) as part of routine clean-outs! I have grown tired of endeavouring to find official data on the many cases like these. But there is simply nowhere one can go. The difference was illustrated by the comedian and entertainer Michael Bentine (a deep student of the paranormal and an Intelligence Officer during World War II). We were talking about his involvement with foo fighters during late 1944 and (always the one to be serious in light-hearted annecdotal form) he told me \"The difference between Britain and America is obvious from the phone books — in the USA you can look up anything you want... the mail service, TV service and the secret service '• — it's listed right there in the book\". Needless to say this is not possible in Britain. Whilst it is obvious that there must be documents about UFOs in the hands of intelligence services, nobody knows for sure where those places are and you certainly cannot just write to them, as you can to the FBI or CIA. There is a major U.S. Army base a few miles from my home. It is called Burtonwood and is a very old establishment. Whilst officially just a home for tins of food (a big store depot) and with an overgrown runway that sees no traffic, the motorway which runs through the middle of it dips alarmingly at this point. \"Subsidence\" is the explanation offered; although there is no doubt that much of what goes on at Burtonwood is hidden from view...below ground. Local residents tell some strange tales of walking their dogs by the perimeter fence at night and being waved angrily away by men in silver suits! - \"SPECIAL BRANCH\" A few years back one local teacher wrote to arrange a tour of the base for her children. The base usually cooperates very happily. However, this teacher coincidentally happened to be a member of CND (the anti-nuclear weapons campaign). She was not active and tens of thousands of British citizens are also members. Burtonwood also claims to have no weapons there. But this woman was visited by two men who alleged they were doing a survey. Their questions quickly strayed from economic issues onto ones concerning nuclear weapons and her interest in Burtonwood. Only her persistence and a remarkably honest local chief 'of police eventually produced the truth. These two men worked for \"Special Branch\" — a sort of cross between military intelligence and the civilian police. They do not have uniforms and often pose as journalists or salesmen. Shades of the MIB! I had my own brush with Special Branch on a small scale (as explained in The Pennine UFO Mystery — Grafton Books, 1983). That is the occasion I know about ^- of course! In 1967 there was a major wave of sightings in Britain. Then Home Secretary, Labour MP Merlyn Rees, had to field questions in the House of Commons and decided to make sure that MoD policy on UFOs was more open. The MoD were told to stop destroying files at five year intervals — and this practice has meant that all cases post-1962 are still at their Whitehall offices. The MoD also started to issue regular statistical evaluations. This did not last long — and was discontinued soon after Rees went into the political \"back benches\" (as opposition in the British Parliament is called). These reports gave figures for hundreds of cases collated each year and about 10 per cent of them rated as unexplained, although how this evaluation was conducted has never been made clear. It is worth rioting that Rees (still a (continued next page) 13"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"FREEDOM, Continued Labour politician) was sufficiently impressed by the Rendlesham Forest stories when they appeared in the British press in October 1983 to write to the then Minister of Defence, Michael Heseltine, on behalf of his constituent, Philip Mantle. Heseltine replied in person but was typically evasive — denying everything without actually denying it (which is how the MbD tend to behave as a matter of course). RALPH NOYES Soon after this, Admiral of the Fleet, Lord Hill-Norton, became chief of staff at the MoD. The man who ran the paperwork side of things from a UFO point of view was an under- secretary (a quite senior rank in Whitehall) called Ralph Noyes. Noyes . was in mariy ways like Ed Ruppelt when , he ran Project Blue Book — except he was not' a military officer and had no power to command aircraft or investigations. He merely headed the division DS 8 (Defence Secretariat 8) . which collated all incoming data on UFOs. The period when this two-man team ran the show was 1971-1973 — although it seems no more liberal to anyone surveying British UFO history. The MoD continued to be as secretive as ever. However, both these men were publicly vociferous about the .Rendlesham Forest case and both now openly support the reality of UFOs. Hill-Norton, within the House of Lords All Party UFO Study Group (a rather ad hoc committee that sometimes gets together to chat about things). Noyes has sown a few seeds of confusion by popping up in very mysterious circumstances after the News of the World first broke the story, even giving a lecture to BUFORA where he joked about being an EXMODMIB (ex MoD Man .in Black!) His 'novel' A Secret Property (Quartet books, 1985) is a dark and rather disturbing fiction which allegedly has no relationship with UFO truth — although those who see it open in Rendlesham Forest, astride an RAF \"Bentbridge\" with a mad U.S. base commander called Colonel \"Hoyt\", an eccentric Lord who is obsessed by 14 UFOs, an \"Iron Lady\" female conservative prime minister (who dies hilariously just as she is about to reveal the truth to a gathering of UFO investigators in a packed football stadium), will, I suspect, find such a suggestion: utterly absurd. Of course it has a relationship! Noyes emigrated to Italy after i finishing his book and his brief flirtation with the UFO movement ended in as much confusion and suspicion as it began. I feel sure there is a good deal more 'to his 'performance' 1 than meets the eye. But, whilst he was around he was surprisingly forthcoming to me about his thirty years in the MoD and their UFO interest. He told me on the record (at least he knew I was taping him!) that they had a \"situation map\" in a sealed room which logged all incoming cases and was strictly .off limits. That they .monitored the UFO situation very carefully. That despite denials they .had good quality gun- camera film taken by persuing RAF jets. That they were utterly baffled by'the UFOs, although they knew them to be real. And that they always had to answer public questions in an around about a fashion as they could, based on the motto \"if you can satisfy somebody be telling then nothing — do it! If you can't — tell them nothing!\" Around the time Noyes officially retired from the MoD, to become a writer or a spy (depends which way you look at things), I became a full-time UFO researcher. In 19781 tried to argue the MoD with logic into being more open about UFOs. They told me they were only interested because of potential defence implications — but there were none. So why were they still interested? Because they could not assume there never would be any. Why not be more cooperative and let serious researchers (i.e. me!) see their data? Sorry — they told me — if we made it available to you we would have to pacify all the 'nuts' and we don't have the time or money. So — if I could persuade a science institute (e.g. a university) — which I thought I could — would they hand over their records on the realization that if this was not a defence matter it was of scientific interest and if they had no money to handle it someone else might. In a word — I was told — no: When I persisted — in two words — I was told — go away. . The length of time between my letters and MoD responses grew longer and longer and ultimately I just stopped getting replies. I had evidently exhausted their stock of platitudes which usually pacified other enquirers, and, having nothing new they could say, they followed the instruction and said nothing. Then — in a three day spell in February 1979 — all hell broke loose. There were several classic cases, but the most important was on the night of 24 February — between 02:00 and 03:00 hours. PENNINE CASES At just after 2 am something disc- like and certainly unexplained descended into a quarry in the Pennine Hills of north-west England. It was seen by three witnesses. Mike Sacks, a local businessman, had my phone number via the Jodrell Bank radio telescope (who cooperate with us ori investigations). He was so concerned he called me immediately — so I know for certain this time a>as 2 am. . Meanwhile he set off to drag his brother up the hills with a camera to \"film it\". Here he found no UFO, but two police officers searching the same hillside. They had seen a UFO too! Whilst I was involved in the investigation of this case I did not know that fifty miles west, on the English coast, dozens of people had been disturbed by a glowing orange object that whizzed across the sky, created radio interference, made one couple leap out of their car thinking the flames of passion had set it on fire, and being chased by a police car in one town and a taxi in another. The seaside resort of Blackpool (rather like England's Las Vegas — on a somewhat less grand style!) was in direct line of this thing which shook the pier so violently the two security guards were sent rushing outside in panic. But the most serious events took place at a caravan park near Southport. Here doors shook, windows rattled and there was some damage to the trailer (continued next page)"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"FREEDOM, Continued homes. The local MP was furious and demanded answers in the House. He was told it was a photo-reconnaisance aircraft (which it was not) or a meteor (which do not normally come low enough to blow trailers about, or shake piers). It was some time before these two events were seen in context. The UFO landing in the quarry at about 2 am. The orange ball of fire streaking low across the sky (with a roar) from the same area at 2:35 am and traversing all the observation points until shooting out over the Irish Sea at 2:45 am, and then returning inland (across Blackpool) about twenty minutes later. It is perfectly reasonable to see this as some craft going off (at full belt) after the original UFO. For there is little doubt that the noisy, low flying orange sphere LUQS a jet aircraft, with after-burners blazing, breaking every security regulation in the book to pursue somefhing. It must have had very good reason to cross airlanes and residential areas — strictly prohibited. The most likely explanation is, of course, all too obvious. Once I figured this out I approached the MoD, who advised in their brilliant way that \"a special exercise\" (doing what?) was underway using USAF F-lll jets from Upper Heyford in Oxfordshire. They did not say this was the \"UFO\", but left that impression /firmly dangling. Upper Heyford flatly and categorically denied this when approached. The base commander himself was pretty adamant (Colonel Shrihofer) (\"definitely • not F-llls, and that's official!\") So I pointed this out to the MoD, who needed two'reminders and more than a year to answer — by which time the case was dead as the dodo. Ultimately they argued that they never suggested it as the answer, and as the USAF denied it they were evidently wrong in this suggestion (which they • didn't make in the first' place!) — so back to square one. Strike up another unknown. Of course, I have asked for records on this case....which they admit to knowing about so must have. I have never even been denied them, but have also never been offered them. As usual — my awkward questions have just been ignored. How often things like this go on, is impossible to say. My file on this case is extensive because I put so much effort into it. But it got me nowhere in the end. Maybe an FOIA request to Upper Heyford about the events of 24 February 1979 could be more revealing. Who knows? The rest — as they say — is history. S/cy Crash reveals all the fun and games concerning the MoD over that matter. Since 1985 (as the postscript to the 1986 paperback edition shows) I have taken to getting MPs to ask my questions of the MoD — on the basis that they will be harder to ignore. But MPs have time pressures too and the MoD.can be (and are) just as evasive when. replying to them. Sadly, these people are not familiar with UFOs and so have no basis to judge the adequacy of an answer from Whitehall. Figures given in the House of Commons during 1984 (the most recent tabled questions on UFOs) reveal that 1500 reports came to them in the three years to 1983. This is ten times the number civilian UFO societies have! Considering .the small size of Britain and the lack of interest shown in UFOs, this total (collated from police forces, air bases and civil airports) is staggering. Compare it with the figures given by Ruppelt for the hey day of UFOs in the early fifties. Clearly — UFOs are still here. Clearly — the MoD are going to extreme lengths to collect reports. Clearly — they continue to use Britain's lack of 'freedom of information' to good effect. There are moves to get a \"Freedom of Information\" Act in Britain. Whilst the present conservative government is in power this stands no chance, as they are firmly wedded to the Official Secrets Act ( the means by which prison sentences can follow any release of even ridiculously minor data). However, if after the 1987 election a different party wins it is possible that an act will arrive — as .the public mood does favour it. Time will tell — but whether in the long run it will take us any nearer remains to be seen. Meantime we must simply do our job and keep badgering the authorities to make sure that their stand on UFOs does not meet with sheep-like acceptance. ALERT, Continued can be compared only with the famous Washington \"invasion\" of 1952. President Sarney was informed that night at a state banquet in Brasilia for President Duarte of El Salvador. Isolated sightings were also reported by a few witnesses in Rio de Janeiro; and a large \"solid object\" was sighted in Fortaleza in northern Brazil on the afternoon of May 21. Astronomer Ronaldo Mourao, the director of Rio's Observatory and the country's top . UFO skeptic, boldly suggested the luminous dots could have been caused by a \"meteor shower\" linked to Halley's comet. Brazilian ufologists, such as Irene Granchi of Rio, Prof. Flavio Pereira of Sao Paulo, and others, analyzed the* UFO explanation in view of similar cases registered previously both in Brazil and elsewhere. Even NASA astronaut Dr. Story Musgrave became involved in the melee. A space M.D. who flew on the Skylab and Shuttle missions, he was attending a technical conference in Sao Paulo when the story hit the news. The Brazilian press quoted him as saying: \"UFOs are like witches. I don't believe in them but they exist for sure.\"  .. Surprisingly, Air Force Minister Lima .was more outspoken than anybody else. \"I've always wanted to see flying saucers since I was child,\" said Gen. Lima, adding that \"the sky was entirely clear and there were no aircraft in the sky when the lights were detected. Technically speaking, there is no explanation.\" His approach is a good example, of Brazil's new democratic style: The minister also announced that a special Air Force Technical Commission was set up to investigate and evaluate the radar tapes, radio communications and visual testimonies of this case. No time limit was given for the completion of the Commission's report."},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"CRASH COURSE By Ann Druffel Pasadena-based Ann Druffel is a regular contributor to the pages of tbe Journal. At last! A \"crash course\" for those with' newly-developing interest in UFOs. Such persons, be they scientific or lay, immediately want to begin reading in the field. Where do they turn? How do they choose the books which will give them objective, factual information? How do they separate kooks from cults, or falsehood from facts? And even if they are fortunate enough to be guided by some knowledgeable person to the best sources of information, how do they find time to read it all? The Los Angeles UFO Research Group (LAUFORG) has provided an answer for people who have begun to search out FACTS about these elusive objects. LAUFORG has written a book, an information source unique in the field. Entitled \"INTRODUCTION TO ISSUES OF UFO RESEARCH\", it is available for all those who have become interested in the UFO subject, but who do not have the time to delve into the voluminous scientific and objective literature produced since 1947. LAUFORG is a small group of scientists, engineers, and other professional persons, who have combined their expertise and produced a comprehensive summary on this worldwide phenomenon. The 94-page soft-cover book (photocopied) combines a readable style with the best of referenced literature on such facets of the field as: •The historical background of UFOs. •History of Government-funded UFO research. • Recent Government UFO investigations. •Classification techniques applied to different types of UFO sightings. •Numerous sample cases from the 16 best objective worldwide sources. •A discussion of witness profiles and reliability. •Physical phenomena associated with UFOs, including electrostatic, magnetostatic effects and electromag- netic effects, physical traces, and photographic evidence. •Physiological and psychological effects of UFO close encounters on humans and animals. •The urgent need of \"immediacy\" in effective UFO research. •The public's right to know what our government knows about UFOs. •Suggested techniques for more efficient data-gathering. •Objectives and suggested data analysis techniques. •INTRODUCTION TO ISSUES OF UFO RESEARCH, therefore, is a perfect starting point for .scientific, technical, and lay persons alike who: •Wish to know basic facts about what has transpired in objective UFO research during the past 40 years. •Who are newly inspired to learn about UFOs and wish summarized information regarding the best references to track down and read. As for you, readers of the MUFON UFO JOURNAL, already knowledge- able about UFOs, at last there is ONE book, reasonably priced, which you can place into the hands of friends, colleagues, government officials or potential funding sources which will give them a comprehensive, easy-to- read survey of solid, documented UFO reports PLUS a methodology for extended research into this important field of study. Who are LAUFORG's members and the authors of this newest contribution to UFO literature? They include, in alphabetical order, Jerry Bernath, M.D., whose extensive interest in UFOs runs the range of physiological effects to close-encounter victims to puzzling psychic effects reported in UFO cases; the author of this article, Ann Druffel, veteran UFO researcher and author in Southern California; William Hassel, Ph.D., MUFON State Director for Southern California, with a special interest in theories of UFO propulsion; Richard M. Neal, Jr. M.D. who specializes in long-lasting physiological effects in CE HI and CE IV cases; Ron Olch, a computer scientist whose expertise enabled this book to be, perhaps, the first computer-produced UFO book in history; Dennis Regan, PhD., noted in the field for his studies of tape-recorded UFO sounds; Paul Smith, a UFO research veteran and determined tracker of selected historical UFO cases; and Vincent Uhlenkott, who slogged in the,sea of California UFO data sightings for many years while maintaining a special interest in instrumented data and theories of UFO propulsion. There were other contributors, including notably the late Barbara Mathey, whose charm, intellect, and linguistic abilities graced her international inquiries in the field for many years.

Rupelt, former head of Air Force Project Blue Book, 1956, Doubleday, Garden City, N.Y.) Quoting from the hardback edition, starting on page 219, Captain Ruppelt offers the following: \"The Montana Movie had been taken on August 15, 1950, by Nick Mariana, the manager of the Great Falls baseball team. It showed two. large bright lights flying across the sky. in echelon formation. There were no clouds in the movie to give an indication of the UFOs' speed, but at one time they passed behind a water tower. The lights didn't show any detail; they appeared to be large circular objects. \"Mariana had sent his movies to the Air Force back in 1950, but in 1950 there was no interest in the UFO so, after a quick viewing, Project Grudge had written them off as 'the reflections from two F-94 jet fighters that were in the area.' (Editor's Note: Philip Klass accepts the 1950 decision, not the 1952 analysis, since it meets with his prosaic explanations.) \"In 1952, at the request of the Pentagon, I reopened the investigation of the Montana Movie. Working through an intelligence officer at the Great Falls AFB, I had Mariana reinterrogated and obtained a copy of his movie, which I sent to the photo lab. \"When the photo lab got the movie, they had a little something to work with because the two UFOs had passed behind a reference point, the water tower. Their calculations quickly confirmed that the objects were not birds, balloons or meteors. Balloons drift with the wind arid the wind was not blowing in the direction that the two UFOs were traveling. No exact speeds could be measured, but the lab could determine that the lights were traveling too fast to be birds and too slow to be meteors. \"This left airplanes as the only By Walter N. Webb MUFON Astronomy Consultant December 1986 Bright Planets (Evening Sky): The two planets in the south during early evening hours are Jupiter and Mars, both now in Aquarius. Mars, the dimmer and redder of the pair, overtakes the bright giant during the month, passing only half a degree above Jupiter on the 18th, and ending up east of the big planet. Both worlds set in the west shortly before 11 PM in mid-December. The quarter Moon makes a triangle with the two planets on the 7th. Bright Planets (Morning Sky): Venus again reaches greatest brilliancy (magnitude -4.7), this time in the morning sky, on December 11. It rises in the east about 3:30 AM in midmonth and is well up in the SE at dawn. The brilliant planet's crescent phase can be seen in binoculars. Look for Venus not far from the real crescent Moon on the 27th and 28th. Saturn, in Ophiuchus,'becomes increasingly, visible low in the SE toward month's end. At that time it rises about 5:30 AM. Don't confuse the planet with the red star Antares to the right. Meteor Showers: The Moon will bother observers trying to watch the two December meteor • showers.. The Geminids, which radiate from a point near the star Castor in Gemini the Twins, peak on the morning of the 14th at a rate of about 50 per hour. However, it might be best to watch them the previous morning between moonset (about 4:30 AM) and the start of twilight'an hour later. The Ursids, radiating from near the bowl of the Little Dipper, suffer a similar fate from bright moonlight on the 22nd. c o Moon Phases: New moon-December 1 First quarter-December 8 Full moon-December 16 Last quarter-December 24 New moon-December 30 (Nearest Moon of the year) The Stars: , , While the faint autumn stars move into the west, the brilliant luminaries of winter gradually take their place in the east and SE.

Betelgeuse's reddish hue indicates that it is a relatively cool M-type star, while blue-white Rigel is a hot B star. Our own Sun's yellor color tells us it is of medium surface temperature. 18 Both Mariana and his secretary, who had also seen the UFOs, had said that the two jets had appeared in another part of the sky only a minute or two after the two UFOs had disappeared in the southeast. This in itself would eliminate the jets as candidates for the UFOs, but we wanted to double-check. The two circular lights didn't look like two F-94's, but anyone who has done any flying can tell you that an airplane can suddenly catch the sun's rays and make a brilliant flash. \"First we studied the flight paths and the two F-94's. We knew the landing pattern that was being used on the day of the sighting, and we knew when the two F-94's landed. The two jets just weren't anywhere close to where the two UFOs had been. Next we studied each individual light and both appeared to be too steady to be reflections. \"We drew a blank on the Montana Movie — it was an unknown.\" There is a message in this investigation: New facts cannot be obtained regarding old cases if new questions are not asked. Go over your material carefully; somewhere there exists a point that was overlooked, disregarded or simply ignored because it may have seemed to obvious. If we ever expect to expose a government cover-up, we will have to ask the same questions over and over again, but by carefully changing the wording, new answers might start showing up. There is a hole in the armor; we will find it... If the Pentagon had not asked Captain Ruppelt to reopen the Nick Mariana \"Montana Movie\" case, it would have continued to be listed as \"explained.\" Ruppelt asked more questions and as a result the Mariana film is now classified as \"unknown.\" This says to me, that as far as the \"so- called experts\" are concerned, if there is a shadow of a doubt, as good UFO researchers and investigators, we must continue our systematic examination of the facts. Mr. Nicholas Mariana, Sr., is living in Portland, Oregon — and in good health.

The \"First Call for Papers\" was published in the September 1986 issue of the MUFON UFO JOURNAL in the column titled, \"News 'N' Views\" along with the conditions under which they will be submitted, accepted and presented. This is a standard practice for scientific society symposia. The \"Call for Papers\" is again being published in the December 1986 issue of the Journal as a reminder. I want to personally thank Jerome Clark, Editor of the International UFO Reporter for publishing my article \"MUFON Calls for Papers,\" prominently in the July/August 1986, Volume 11, Number 4 issue; the bimonthly publication of the J. Allen Hynek Center for UFO Studies. In his editorial in the same issue titled \"The Emperor's Clothes,\" Mr. Clark published a very complimentary review of the MUFON 1986 UFO Symposium held on the Michigan State University Campus in East Lansing on June 27,28 and 29. The International UFO Reporter is a benefit publication mailed to Associates of the Center for $25.00 or more. Foreign Associates add $7.00 for delivery. All amounts are in U.S. funds. For details, write to 1955 John's Drive, Glenview, Illinois 60025-1615. Based upon the recommendations of Jerome Clark in IUR, several people have ordered copies of the MUFON 1986 UFO Symposium Proceedings (186 pages) bearing the theme \"UFOs: Beyond the Mainstream of Science.\" Copies may be obtained from MUFON for $10.00 each in U.S. funds plus $1.50 for postage and handling. Foreign orders must.be paid in U.S. funds by International Postal Money Order, cash, or a check made payable through a U.S. Bank. * * * In the reorganization of MUFON in Ohio, Richard D. Seifried, State DALE GOUDIE (CUFON) Director, has reassigned Richard T. Lee of Cuyahoga Falls to be the State Section Director for Summit and Portage counties. Mr. Lee has been a member of MUFON starting in 1974 and a State Section Director since 1979. James R. \"Jim\" Melesciuc, State Director for Massachusetts, has made the following selections or reassignments of State Section Directors: Joanne Bruno is now responsible for Essex County and Stephen J. Firmani for Middlesex County. Wayne Erickson has accepted additional duties to that of State Section Director for Wayne and Oakland counties by being appointed Assistant State Director for Michigan by George and Shirley Coyne, Co- State Directors. They have also promoted Virginia M. Tilly to State Section Director for Berrien, Cass, Van Buren and Kalamazoo counties. Both of these fine investigators served on the host committee for the MUFON 1986 UFO Symposium. Burt L. Monroe, Jr., Ph.D., State Director for Kentucky, recognized the field investigative talent of M. Anne Albin and promoted her to State Section Director for Powell, Montgomery, Menifee, Wolfe and Estill counties. Skip D. Schultz of Woodburn, Oregon volunteered to serve as State Section Director for Marion County in Oregon when he was invited. * * * Dale D. Goudie, manager of the Computer UFO Network (CUFON) in South Seattle, Washington, has provided the following pertinent information for Journal readers who own computers and modems. CUFON now has over 700 members with MUFON members making up the largest segment. Dale has relayed the following message: \"to all MUFON users thank you for your support and input for CUFON. If you have signed- on CUFON previously, there is a message waiting for you with your password and information on how to use the system.\" The systems number is (206) 722-5738 using 300 Baud (b.p.s.) and the systems voice line \"UFO Information Service\" is (206) 721-5035. Our belated and best wishes for an enduring marriage are extended to Kenneth R. McLean, State Director for Wyoming, who was married to Karen A. Urbam on August 19,1986 in Laramie, Wyoming. Ken is a Ph.D. Candidate at the University of Wyoming. * * * Bob Gribble, the manager of the National UFO Reporting Center, P.O. Box 1807, Seattle, Washington 98111, telephone 1-206-722-3000, advised your Director that he will hereby forward all UFO sighting reports made to his UFO Hotline to MUFON in Seguin, Texas for investigation. During the past 6 years he has assigned them to several different UFO organizations, however only MUFON has produced results. Since MUFON has the largest and most extensive field investigators organization in the U.S.A., this is a logical decision. For this method to be successful, it is imperative that the State Director, State Section Director or Field Investigator that is assigned the case respond promptly to MUFON or return the case to MUFON headquarters 'for reassignment. The Cash-Landrum Case, as an example, was not assigned to MUFON until February 17, 1981 after another organization failed to properly respond. Each investigator must recognize that 80 to 90% of the sightings reported to a UFO Hotline number by the public may have a mundane explanation (IFO) after a thorough investigation.

Andrus, Cash- Landrum Case; Tom Gates, Public Attitudes About UFOs; James M. McCampbell, UFO Effects Upon People; and Richard Haines, Ph.D., The Inflight Disappearance of Frederick Valentich. Sunday's program opened with Tom Page presenting a UFO slide lecture composed of Paul Cerny's collection; Joyce Needles, The Unlimited Mind; Marvin Taylor, Bridging the Gap; and a panel of people who shared their abduction or close encounter experiences with the audience. The visual aids and exhibits complimented the fine speaking program. The former IDS UFO Exhibit (Minneapolis, Minnesota) was purchased by Marvin Taylor several years ago and is the center of attraction at his permanent UFO Exhibit for the general public in Sonora, California. The entire exhibit was transported from his UFO museum to the Main Building at the Mother Lode Fairgrounds for the symposium. In addition to a UFO photographic display on free standing exhibit boards and life size replicas of UFO entities, two video documentaries were being shown simultaneously. As a convenience to the attendees, the Sonora Jaycees operated a food concession in the main building which had seating provisions for 1200 people. Paul Cerny's electric powered model of a flying saucer was TAYLOR EXHIBIT one of the featured exhibits. Since Marvin Taylor is so well known in the area, the entire city co-operated in promoting the UFO symposium on signs and billboards, while the area press, radio and TV crews interviewed the speakers. Mr. Taylor and his symposium committee, consisted of Paul Cerny, Joyce Needles, Mr. and Mrs. John Dunlap, Bruce Sullivan, Marvin's wife Linda, and others too numerous to list, must be congratulated for their detailed planning and implementation of their second very successful UFO symposium. Your Director was amazed at the enthusiasm generated by Marvin Taylor in promoting MUFON in Northern California. (Marge Christensen, MUFON's Public Relations Director, would have been at a loss for expletives to describe the outstanding public education that the symposium engendered.) * * * While speaking about sympos- iums, the Fund for UFO Research will be hosting the MUFON 1987 UFO Symposium on campus at American University in Washington, D.C. on June 26, 27, and 28, 1987, with Dr. Bruce Maccabee, Chairman and Fred Whiting, Symposium Coordinator. During a business trip to San Antonio. on October 20th, a symposium coordination meeting and dinner was held by Fred Whiting, Tom Deuley, Dennis Stacy and Walt Andrus to provide Fred with suggestions for speakers, share symposium administration problems and solutions, and overall coordination direction between FUFOR and MUFON. During a recent telephone call to Bruce Maccabee concerning symposium planning, your Director became one of the first people to congratulate Bruce and his wife upon the arrival of their new son. (Bruce was so excited that he entered the announcement on Dale Goudie's CUFON computer net in Seattle, Washington.) * * * To promote the MUFON 1987 UFO Symposium, Marge Christen- sen is producing a VHS video tape to send to MUFON state organizations inviting everyone to start planning now to attend the Washington, D.C. conference. It will also include segments of newscasts which featured reports on previous UFO conferences or sightings. Three copies of the tape will be shared by the State organizations with directions for forwarding.
