Three people were directly involved in these alleged events. Keith Rylance (39), his wife Amy (22), and then- business partner, Petra Heller (35), were on their prop- erty, which was being developed as \"Whispering Winds\" winery. Other potential activities were also being devel- oped at the location. The following account comes from interviews con- ducted by us with them, along with primary source ma- terial such as TV interviews. Keith told us that he had gone to sleep in the cara- van bedroom at about 9:30 p.m. Petra retired to her bed- room in the caravan annex. Amy stayed on a couch watching TV in the caravan annex \"lounge room.\" All of these locations were in close proximity, separated by a window and wall respectively from the lounge room. Petra's room had a door leading to the lounge room, which was left ajar. The door to the bedroom, where Keith was, apparently was open to the lounge room. Amy ap- parently fell asleep on the couch. A storm was in the area. Around 11:15 p.m., Petra was reportedly awakened, and when she entered the adjacent lounge was confronted by an extraordinary sight that allegedly quickly over- whelmed her. A rectangular beam of light was being projected through the open window of the caravan lounge room. This light beam appeared to be truncated at the end. Inside the beam, Petra claims to have seen Amy in a sleep prone position, being carried out head first through the window. Underneath her, also within the beam were the items that had been on the coffee table adjacent to the couch Amy had been on. Before apparently fainting in shock, Petra saw that the beam was coming from a disc-shaped UFO hovering just above the ground a short distance away, near a tree at the rear of the clear sec- tion, immediately behind the annex caravan house. Petra reports she believes she was only in a faint for a very short period of time. Regaining consciousness, she began screaming. Keith reports that he was awak- ened by the commotion coming from Petra. As he came from the caravan bedroom and stepped down into the lounge room annex, Keith claims he was confronted by the sight of a highly agitated Petra and the contents of About the authors Bill Chalker, who lives in Sydney, Australia, is one of Australia's leading UFO researchers. He has written ex- tensively on the subject, and is a contributing editor for the International UFO Reporter. His book The Oz Files: the Australian UFO Story, was published in 1996. Diane Harrison is director of Australian UFO Research Network (AUFORN). the coffee table on the floor in front of the window. He told us that he soon realised that the window screen was torn in both a vertical fashion and along the bottom of the window frame. Keith indicated that initially he couldn't get any sense out of Petra, who was crying and very agitated, so he rushed outside trying to locate Amy. She was reportedly nowhere to be found. Keith states that when he became less agi- tated himself he was eventually able to get from Petra an idea of what happened. Keith claims he initially refused to believe what Petra was telling him. He said he rushed out- side again, trying to find his wife. Eventually as the situation became clearer, Keith de- cided to call the police. Keith called the Tiaro police around 11.40 p.m., reporting that his wife had been abducted and imploring that the police should come out. The manning status at that time caused some delays in the police com- ing out, but about an hour and a half after the initial call, Senior Constable Robert Maragna from Tiaro and an of- ficer from Maryborough, a larger city to the northeast, ar- rived at the site. Initially police thought they might have walked into a situation involving foul play, even perhaps a murder scene, but then the bizarre circumstances of the alleged events came into focus. The two people, Keith and Petra, were claiming that Amy had been abducted by a \"spaceship\"! The officers were struggling to keep an open mind. They were joined later by Sgt. John Bosnjak, the officer in charge of the Tiaro police. They confirmed that Keith and Petra appeared to be in an agitated state, and that there was no sign of Amy. The torn screen was examined. A flowering bush, commonly known as \"yesterday, today, tomorrow,\" located immedi- ately outside the left side of window, had indications of possibly being affected by heat or another mechanism along its right side. Oddly, another flowering bush, a hibiscus, located immediately on the right-hand side of the window area, was not affected in the same way. The police took samples for possible later testing. While the police were at the property, a phone call came through, which was taken by Keith. A woman was calling from Mackay, indicating that she had taken a somewhat December, 2001 MUFON UFO Journal Page 3"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"distressed and apparently dehydrated young woman from a BP petrol service station on the northern outskirts of the central Queensland city of Mackay, some 490 miles to the north of the Gundiah-Tiaro area. The young woman turned out to be Amy Rylance, and the female caller was calling to advise that Amy was ap- parently all right, and was at the Mackay hospital, where she had been examined by a doctor. Keith handed the phone to Snr. Constable Maragna. Given these extraordinary circumstances, Mackay po- lice were called in, making a total of three police stations involved in the investigation-Tiaro, on the outskirts of cen- tral Queensland; Maryborough, on the coast; and Mackay, some 490 miles to the north of the Gundiah-Tiaro area. A statement was notarized by the Mackay police, with a Justice Act acknowledgement, that required Amy to ac- knowledge that what she had stated was true to the best of her knowledge and belief, and that if it is admitted as evidence, that she may be liable to prosecution if she had indicated anything in it that she knew was false. This statement indicated that she recollected lying on the couch at the Gundiah property. She had no recollec- tion of the events that Petra described, but claimed she then next remembered waking up lying on a bench in a strange rectangular room. Illumination came from the walls and the ceiling. She was alone. She indicated she called out and heard what seemed to be a male voice, asking her to be calm and that everything would be all right and that she would not be harmed. Soon an opening appeared in the wall and \"a guy\" about 6 feet tall walked into the room. The man appeared to be slender in build, but in perfect proportion, covered head to foot in a full body suit. He had what seemed to be a black covering mask on his face, with a hole for his eyes, nose and mouth. He repeated his calming assurances. Amy's story includes some intriguing elements, such as her recollection that she was on the \"ship\" for seven days, but that less than three hours passed in our terms. She also indicated the humanoid described the \"ship\" as oper- ating on principles that seemed like a description of a whole ship based on a form of total nanotechnology. There were two beings that appeared to be normal human-like \"hu- manoids\" in \"biological suits\" with \"gray masks.\" There were also a few smaller humanoids. The \"guy\" told her they were returning her to a place not far from where they took her, because the lights were wrong at the property and it wasn't safe. She then indi- cates she found herself lying on the bed and falling asleep. The next thing she recollects is that she woke up on the ground with trees around her. She felt disorientated, could smell the ocean, and indi- cated she was not sure how long she stumbled through bushland, but seemingly it was for a long time, feeling she wasn't making much progress. She then came out onto a road that looked like a highway and saw a light from a petrol station. She walked into the station, where the staff, seeing her state, tried to offer some assistance. She accepted some water, as she felt somewhat dehy- drated. Initially she was not able to answer identifying questions, and didn't know where she was. She was also 0 290 580 870 1160 km Reference Map asked if she had been drinking or was on drugs, to which she said no. Amy indicated she felt tired, sore, drained, and lethargic. She asked a woman at the service station to take her to the hospital, as she didn't know where else to go. The woman and her friend took Amy to the hospital. Later Amy spoke with two police officers and also spoke with her husband Keith from the hospital. She then went to Mackay police station, where she gave the statement of events. Amy also indicated that this sort of thing had never happened to her before, but when she was in the 5th year of school she had seen a large UFO surrounded by smaller objects. The police arranged to put Amy in a motel pending the arrival of her husband. He and Petra arrived during the day and indicated they spent considerable time with Amy discussing what happened. Extensive notes were apparently made and photographs were taken of a trian- gular arrangement of marks on her inner right thigh, marks on each heel, and the growing out of her hair which she had dyed earlier in the week. Her hair had apparently started to show her former color, suggestive that some considerable time had passed for her, apparently indicative of rather more than a few hours. Body hair had allegedly also become somewhat more pronounced than would otherwise would be appar- ent for the short time involved. A copy of the Australian Ufologist magazine was Page 4 MUFON UFO Journal December 2001"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"purchased from a news agent, and Keith, Petra, and Amy started to learn more about UFOs. Keith contacted the Australian UFO Research Network (AUFORN) office number mentioned in the magazine. Diane Harrison took the call on Friday, Oct. 5, 2001, at 3:20 p.m., and for the next hour or so listened to the story that Keith and Amy told. Petra was apparently sleeping at the time. Given the nature of the story, its complexity, and the fact it apparently featured the alleged use of \"solid light,\" Diane decided to bring Bill Chalker into the investigation, making contact with him during the evening of Friday, Oct. 5. Paradoxically, Bill was scheduled to talk at a Brisbane UFO conference on Oct. 13, and his topics included \"solid light\" cases and the application of science to alien abduc- tion cases. Bill put a call through to them at the motel, securing permission to record the conversation. Once again, Petra was not available to talk about her part in the alleged events. Keith went into considerable detail about the events, re- ferring often to the notes they had apparently been com- piling during the day. The details described covered the events Petra had witnessed, what Keith had experienced, and what Amy told them had happened to her during her experience. Finally, Bill spoke with Amy, focusing mainly on the events before and after the claimed onboard experiences, because Keith had already gone into considerable detail about the latter. Bill discussed with Amy her general re- sponses, her physical state, and her current state of thought on her experiences. Keith seemed to want to control how both the media and investigators would get involved. His desire to contact the media promptly drew from both Diane and Bill the suggestion that he should think very carefully about the possible ramifications of doing so. Keith seemed to feel that it was important to get the story out, as it would come out anyway, and this way he could control the way it did. He was also trying to restrict the way the investigators could or should look into their expe- rience. He claimed they didn't need to prove the experi- ence. While he didn't directly witness the experiences, he believed both Amy and Petra. Given the possible nature of the event, and that irre- spective of the ultimate resolution of the affair, it seemed destined to be a big story, we decided to undertake an investigation. We had been given an indication from Keith that the three would wait for the investigators to come to Mackay, as the claimants were in no apparent hurry to return to Gundiah. They gave permission for us to visit the property on the way. Bill arrived in the Brisbane area on Tuesday afternoon, Oct. 9. We then travelled to Gundiah, arriving at the Whisper- ing Winds winery property just after 10 p.m. Because of the lateness of the hour, we got the witnesses' permission to stay there overnight and to conduct whatever investiga- tion we needed to do. Keith had arranged for a neighbor to regularly check on the two pets left behind, namely a par- rot and a kelpie dog. He indicated to us that it would be okay to let the dog off for a run, but warned us it was very friendly and inclined to jump all over people. We let the dog off at some point and observed its behavior. At one point it did jump up on the window where the damaged screen was located. This gave some sup- port to the possibility that at least some, if not all, of the damage, could have been caused by the dog. Some of the damage on closer inspection seemed suggestive of possible dog damage. Our inspection of the plant damage also suggested possible prosaic causes, such as heat stress. A plant at the front of the house had similar damage, and a healthy flowering bush of the same species that was at the win- dow examined by us at Mount Basset lawn cemetery has similar damage. A gardener there we spoke to indi- cated that the species often had random or more exten- sive damage of a heat stress nature from hot sunlight. The prosaic possibilities for both the screen and the plant damage are only suggestive at this point, and further in- vestigation is required. Scientists report successful teleportation experiment LONDON — Physicists in Denmark have made two samples of trillions of atoms interact at a dis- tance in an experiment which may bring \"Star Trek\"- style teleportation and rapid quantum computing closer to reality. Eugene Polzik and his colleagues at the Univer- sity of Aarhus are not about to beam anyone up to the Starship Enterprise, but their research reported in the science journal Nature makes the idea of instantly transporting an object from one place to another less far fetched. It involves quantum entanglement-a mysterious concept of entwining two or more particles without physical contact. Albert Einstein once described it as \"spooky action at a distance.\" Entangled states are needed for quantum com- puting and teleportation. Scientists have entangled states of a few atoms in earlier experiments, but Polzik and his team have done it with very large numbers and using laser light. \"It is the first result where two macroscopic material objects have been entangled,\" Polzik explained in a telephone inter- view. \"We have produced entanglement at a distance which means you and I can share entangled objects which is important for quantum communication, including quantum teleportation.\" In 1998, what has been described as the first teleportation experiment was done when scientists at the California Institute of Technology teleported a beam of light across a laboratory bench. Ignacio Cirac, a physicist at the University of Innsbruck in Austria, said the achievement of Polzik and his team could lead to real-life quantum communication systems, teleportation, and quantum computers.

Our investi- gation generated many issues and questions, which we feel need resolution in order to assist interpretations of these events. Further extensive investigations were undertaken in Mackay, focusing in particular in the area where Amy was returned. These included attempts to reconstruct the circumstances of her return. The BP petrol service station staff were spoken with, and a surveillance video tape that may contain Amy's visit there was provided to us by the station owner. This part of our investigation also generated many issues and questions that need reso- lution if we are to approach any measure of certainty about the real nature of the events. Keith indicated to us he would be available when we got to Mackay, but it was clear on the first day of our investigations there that this wasn't probably going to be the case. When we contacted the motel where they had been the night before, their third motel in Mackay, we learned they had apparently already checked out that morning. We left messages on their phone, but didn't hear from Keith until early on the afternoon of our sec- ond day, as we were leaving Mackay. In his mobile call, Keith apologized for not being avail- able, but said they had relocated to an unspecified loca- tion after having fled the area. The primary reason for this, Keith indicated, was that they had a kind of \"men- in-black\" experience-a pursuit of their vehicle by a high- powered dark brown 4-wheel truck. The nature of this event apparently frightened Keith, Amy, and Petra, prompting Keith to attempt to lose the vehicle and even- tually leave the area. We have heard from Keith again, and remain hope- ful that the witnesses will get into more direct contact with us. This affair is both extraordinary and controversial. Many have rushed to judgement, but given it's complex and evolving dynamics, caution and patience is neces- sary. We have many issues and questions we would like to try to resolve. Further contact with the Rylances and Petra Heller may help this process. The case is far from closed and requires an objective, open minded investigation. Only time will give us the possibility of resolution and certainty about this intrigu- ing, but controversial, affair.

(Check, MO, or cash, U.S. dollars.) Teleportation event a part of several UFO cases By Dwight Connelly Teleportation cases, while infrequent, are certainly not unknown in the field of ufology. Strictly speaking, the Aus- tralian case described in this issue is not a teleportatipn case, since the abductee was allegedly observed floating from the dwelling, rather than disappearing from one loca- tion and reappearing in another. In other words, in a true teleportation case an abductee, entity, or object would have to dematerialize, not merely be transported. However, teleportation, a term apparently coined by Charles Fort seventy years go in his book Lo, has tradi- tionally referred to ufological events in which the abductee or object has been picked up at one location and dropped off at another. Thus the 1975 Travis Walton case would be considered perhaps the best known and best documented \"teleportation\" case, but there is also an element of teleportation in the well-documented 1993 Kelly Cahill case in Australia, as reported in her book Encounter (1996). The 1965 extensively-researched case involving Debbie Jordon and Kathy Mitchell, investigated by Budd Hopkins and reported in the books Intruders and Abducted, had an element of teleportation when the car driven by 16- year-old Kathy was reportedly lifted from the highway, taken into a UFO, and eventually deposited on a church parking lot. Other teleportation cases, usually less known and less well documented, have been reported for many years. Those wanting a full book of such cases might try to find a copy of parapsychologist Dr. Nandor Fodor's Mind Over Space (1962), even though he did not cover the modern UFO abductee cases. In Exobiology: A Research Guide (1978), Dr. Martin H. Sable cited 53 references to UFO- related teleportations. In a foreward to the Sable book, Dr. J. Allen Hynek said, \"These new empirical observa- tions and phenomena no longer can be summarily dis- missed.\" Indeed there are several modern cases, most of which have not been thoroughly investigated. In May of 1968, for example, Dr. Geraldo Vidal, a well- known Buenos Aires attorney, and his wife were report- edly driving between Chascomus and Buenos Aires, Ar- gentina, and friends were traveling ahead of them in an- other car. The passengers in the two vehicles lost touch with each other at Maipu, and the other couple backtracked to see if they could locate the Vidals, fearing they had experienced car trouble. According to Dr. Vidal's account of the incident, the Vidals had encountered a strange fog, and were unable to ac- count for the next 48 hours. When they regained conscious- ness they were still inside their car (a Peugot 403), which was parked. They experienced pains in their necks, but otherwise appeared unhurt. The surface of the car, how- ever, was burned, as with a blowtorch, but operated per- Page6 MUFON UFO Journal December 2001"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"fectly. Their watches had stopped. After inquiry, they discovered they were no longer in Argentina, but in Mexico, 4,000 miles from where they had encountered the fog. The Vidals flew back to Argentina, where Mrs. Vidal was taken to a private clinic for treatment of a nervous disorder. She died the following year, a victim of leuke- mia. No hypnosis was done on either of the Vidals. On the same night the Vidals disappeared, a man (identity unknown) was reportedly treated at the Maipu Hospital after exposure to \"a strange fog\" on the same road trav- eled by the Vidals. On May 31, 1974, in what was then known as Rhode- sia, Peter, 24, and his wife Frances, 21, experienced the sighting of two UFOs, observed a strange individual along- side the road, experienced effects on their auto's lighting system, felt extreme cold inside their auto, and lost con- trol of their auto as they traveled from Salisbury, Rhode- sia, to their home in Durban, South Africa. Frances fell asleep, and Peter said he began to feel hypnotized. When they arrived at Beit Bridge on the South African border, they were surprised to discover they had gotten there an hour earlier than expected, and Peter said he had no recollection of seeing the sun until they arrived. They had traveled 180 miles in an hour and 45 minutes, averag- ing 100 m.p.h. In addition, when they refueled their auto it took only half a gallon of gasoline, which meant they got 360 miles to the gallon. However, the odometer of their Peugot had registered only ten miles instead of the 180 miles trav- eled. (There are several other aspects of this case, which was investigated by Carl Van Vlierden, MUFON repre- sentative for South Africa. A more detailed look at the case by Joe Brill and Dwight Connelly appeared in the March 1975 issue of Skylook, the original name for the MUFON UFO Journal.) Another case involving loss of control of a vehicle al- legedly occurred on Jan. 6,1976, near Stanford, KY. Three women, Mrs. Mona Stafford, Louise Smith, and Elaine Thomas, drove out of Stanford, KY, toward what they thought might be a crashed aircraft, but encountered a saucer-shaped object that shined a bright light onto their car. Suddenly, Louise, who was driving, realized she was no longer in control of the car. The speedometer showed a speed of 85 mph, but Louise said she did not have her foot on the accelerator. \"It felt like we were crossing those grooves they have in the highway to slow you down be- fore you reach a stop sign,\" said Mona. They quickly found themselves in Hustonville. \"It was like something had picked us up in Stanford and set us down in Hustonville,\" said Mona. In addition to a period of missing time, Louise and Elaine had burns on the backs of their necks. Upon arriving home they contacted neighbors to show them the burns and to tell them what had happened. The neighbors sug- gested they separate and draw pictures of what they had seen. The women reportedly experienced physiological and psychological problems following the incident. A well-documented case involving both human and A series of images sketched by Betty Andreasson Luca illustrates the appearance of a type of teleportation of entities described in this case. entity teleportation is described by Raymond Fowler in The Andreasson Affair (1979). the story of Mrs. Betty Andreasson Luca. Rather than smoothly moving through the wall of the home, the entities seemed to be projected in a series of images (see drawing above). A case considered fictional by mainline ufologists is reported in The Philadelphia Experiment (1979), by William Moore and Charles Berlitz. In this 1943 incident the U.S. Navy supposedly experimented in the attempted shielding of a ship from either magnetic mines or possible radar waves. The experiment supposedly teleported a ship and some of the sailors, injuring or killing them. Moore later suggested that teleportation was probably not in- volved. A poorly-documented case reportedly occurred in 1968 or 1969, involving Sr. Marcilo Ferraz and his wife, who were driving south from San Paulo, Brazil. Like the Vidals, the couple reportedly encountered a \"white cloud\" near the Uraguay border, passed out, and awakened in Mexico. Both reportedly experienced traumatic shock, and the husband allegedly consulted a doctor a few weeks later, and was told he had a brain tumor. Shortly after this, he reportedly shot himself. Another \"cloud\" case involved a single witness, an 11 - year-old girl, Graciela del Lourdes, who lived in a suburb of Cordoba. Argentina. As she looked out the front door of her home on Aug. 4,1968, a \"white mist\" appeared on the front path and gradually came toward her, she said. \"I could no longer see the other houses, and I couldn't move or call out to Mummy,\" she explained. Then she allegedly found herself on the crowded Plaza Espana in Cordoba. She reported feeling \"intense cold.\" No other details are available. A 1968 case with few details involves a newly-mar- ried couple who had stopped their Volkswagen in the state of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, for a rest. They were re- portedly suddenly overcome with drowsiness. When they regained consciousness they found themselves and their December, 2Q01 MUFON UFO Journal Page?"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"VW in Mexico, apparently a favorite dropping off point for teleported people and objects. Another case involves Sr. Dolor Roque, who on April 20,1969, was allegedly riding his horse near Itaucu, Bra- zil, on his way to a pharmacy when he saw \"some lights\" and lost consciousness. When he awakened he found himself, without his horse, on some rocks on the bank of the River Paranaiba at Itumbiara, 250 miles by road (or 150 miles in a straight path) from Itaucu. He reportedly took a bus back home, where he found a worried family and his horse. Another case allegedly occurred in the early morning hours of Jan. 5, 1975. According to the newspaper La Razon, 28-year-old Carlos Alberto Diaz claimed to have been blinded by a light, was \"unable to move a muscle,\" and \"something like a strong wind raised me up through the air\" into \"a spherical chamber not provided with any furniture, and whose walls seemed to be made of translu- cent plastic material.\" Diaz reported that three small humanoids climbed on him and began taking samples of his hair by painlessly pulling it from his head. He passed out, and found himself in Buenos Aires, 300 miles away, and it was now day- light. His watch had stopped at 3:30 a.m. With him was a newspaper he had bought in Bahia Blanca, as well as a duffel bag containing his work clothes. In the early hours of Sept. 23,1978, two participants in the South American Rally, Carlos Acevedo and Miguel Angel Moya, suddendly noticed a bright light behind their Citroen GS 1220, just west of Salina de Piedra, Argen- tina. Thinking it was another car about to overtake them, despite the fact they were traveling 60 mph, Carlos pulled slightly to the right. Suddenly the car was filled with light, and seemed out of control, moving about six feet off the ground and con- tinuing to climb. Moya reports he was \"seeing everything like through a yellow fog, as if I were at a distance, some- place else. I couldn't hear anything. I looked at Carlos and I saw him rigid. Suddenly the light engulfed every- thing and I couldn't see anything, not even my hands.\" The witnesses then seemed to lose all concept of time, then felt a bump and noticed the car was back on the road. The yellow light lost some of its intensity. Acevedo reported, \"The light left the interior of the car, and I observed that to the west something like a cone of yellow light was disappearing, but it didn't end at that point, it was cut off. It was about 4 or 5 meters (12 to 15 feet) at the base, 2 or 3 at the cusp, and 6 meters, maybe 7, in height. The base lighted the surrounding area, al- though I couldn't tell what it was illuminating; in other words, you couldn't see through it. A few seconds later the light retracted itself; it just went up like a curtain, from bottom to top, and the only thing that was left in view was a white/yellowish light, oval in shape, that continued its west heading until it disappeared in the distance.\" Acevedo and Moya were stunned, but decided to re- sume their journey. After traveling for 15 minutes they arrived at Pedro Luro in the province of Buenos Aires, but the trip from Carmen de Patagones to Pedro Luro had taken about an hour longer than it should have. In addition, the car's odometer indicated that the car had traveled 71 km (42 miles) less than the distance between the two cities, indicating teleportation of the vehicle. But in contrast, they discovered that their reserve gaso- line tank was completely empty, despite being filled with 40 liters of gas in the city of Viedma.

His name is Mike Cataldo, a retired Navy chief petty officer. I was interested in more general details of this ac- count, and specifically the reference to \"a report\" Cataldo made with a supervisor. I conducted a Yahoo People Search for Mike Cataldo and found his telephone listed for his residence at Marker Rd. in Rotonda West, FL. Cataldo came to the phone and was surprised at my call, stating that I was the first person to ever contact him about this UFO sighting from 1973. He explained that he had been in touch with Associated Press reporter Natalie Chambers, but only after calling a Pascagoula, MS, news- paper. When calling the newspaper, he asked to talk with an old-timer employee at the paper, someone who might remember the Hickson/Parker abduction. Cataldo said that when he talked with Natalie Chambers, she made reference to the book UFO in Pascagoula. Being un- aware of this book, Cataldo was shocked, saying, \"You gotta be kidding me!\" He went on to excitedly relate the story as it hap- pened back in 1973. \"The story is very true,\" he assured while recounting the event. \"We (Cataldo, Ted Peralta, and Mack Hanna) left the shipyard and rode in Ted's Volkswagen to Hwy. 90, travelingnvest towards Biloxi, MS. It was not even dusk yet. \"When we first saw this thing through the windshield we thought it was a shooting star, going from right to left, but then it came down into a marshy, tree-lined area and hovered there for about 30-seconds. It was spinning and had blinking lights on the top of it all around its edge in a circle. These were blinking lights arranged on it just like you would tape lights to the side of a cake pan.\" Cataldo affirmed that there was a definite structure to be seen, not just blinking lights. \"This thing was like a whitish-gray colored sailor hat, or a tambourine, and it was less than half a mile away and looked as big as any big American airliner I've ever seen. And then it just shot away, almost like it was just suddenly gone.\" Cataldo said that shortly after the sighting he parted company with Ted Peralta and Mack Hanna and changed cars. Then while enroute to Ocean Springs as darkness was setting in, he saw the same object a second time at about the same distance away, watching it for another 45 seconds to one minute before it again shot off as before. Mike Cataldo said that there were other motorists in the area during each episode, and that some of them had slowed down to look at the UFO. \"We were the only ones on the road to stop and look at it though,\" he said. During this time, Cataldo said he never knew anything about the Hickson/Parker claim. He went home, telling his wife about it. Cataldo humorously recalled how his wife said he was hyperventilating with excitement. He The Pascagoula case revisited Editor's Note: For those too young to recall the Pascagoula case, the following summary is provided. I met with Hickson, and was impressed with his ac- count, as were all of the investigators. On Oct. 12, 1973, during a UFO wave, Charles Hickson and Calvin Parker were fishing from a pier at the Shaupeter shipyard in Pascagoula, MS, at about 7 p.m. A buzzing noise caused them to turn around, and they observed an oval-shaped object with a blue light and two windows. It was about eight feet high and about two feet above the ground. A hatch door opened, and three entities floated out. Using crab-like pincers, they floated Hickson and Parker into the UFO. Parker had apparently fainted. Inside, the object was brightly lighted with no appar- ent source for the light. Hickson reported that he was scanned by a large \"eye\" as he lay suspended in the air. With feet dragging the ground, he was returned to the pier. Parker seemed in a trance. After regaining their compsure, Hickson and Parker reported the incident to Keesler Air Force Base, only to be told to report it to civilian authorities. Then they went to the nearby Mississippi Press Register, but it was closed, so they went to the Jackson County Sheriff's Office. After telling their story, they were placed in a vacant room and secretly tape recorded. Their conversation indicated no attempt at hoaxing. James Harder and J. Allen Hynek investigated, and indicated they believed the two were telling the truth about the incident. Hickson later passed a lie detec- tor test. Parker had a nervous breakdown. There were at least two other reports of UFOs in the general vicinity of the sighting that evening, in- cluding a report by Parole Officer Raymond Broadus, Pascagoula City Councilman E.P. Sigalas, and an uni- dentified woman. In another report, Larry Booth of Pascagoula said he observed an object-first station- ary, then slowly moving-with red lights turning in a clockwise motion. went on to liken the anxiety and strangeness of the situa- tion to a large snake sighting he had years earlier in 1963. \"Some things you see in your lifetime that you just don't ever forget,\" he said. The next day he returned to the site with Ted and Mack, and they parked their car at the shipyard area, talking about the sighting from the previous day. They discussed what should be done about it, and if they should report what they saw. Cataldo said that he felt the sight- ing should be reported, and he approached a man by the name of Nick, his division officer. He then approached the executive commander, Lt. Commander Heath, and gave him a verbal report on the sighting. He said that to his knowledge, Heath did not prepare a written report concerning what was told to him. \"Not one of them took me seriously,\" he complained, \"and December, 2001 MUFON UFO Journal Page 9"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"I never heard another thing about it. Nobody ever asked about it again. \"I never knew of the Hickson/Parker ab- duction until days later. It happened on Thursday, and it was not until the following Sunday that I saw the headline in the morning paper about two men taken aboard a flying saucer. I'm telling you I about died.\" The next morning, Oct. 15, Cataldo said that he talked the situation over with his wife and again decided that it would be important to report the UFO sighting. At that time he placed a phone call to a an assistant public rela- tions officer at Keesler AFB. The female taking his call took the information, but Cataldo said that once again nothing resulted from his report. \"I have never talked to the fella involved, Charles Hickson, and I've never discussed this case or met with them at all. I never knew them, and I never saw anything and had no involvement with what they said,\" Cataldo assured, \"and I've never seen a UFO since then, not at all. Not even before then. \"Was it real? You're damn right it was real. I can't say anything about what they did or were involved in. I don't even know if what I saw matches what they saw, but I know what I saw and where I was at. But where we saw the thing going across the sky through our windshield is basically the area where Hickson and Parker said they were taken aboard. The time frame of our sighting might have been around 6:00, but I can't recall for certain.\" Cataldo said that two weeks after the sighting he left for California on temporary duty. While there, he saw Hickson on the Dick Cavett television show. \"I just couldn't believe it; here I was seeing this guy,\" he said. Mike Cataldo explained that he has not seen Ted Peralta for 21 years, but thinks he could possibly be in the San Diego, CA, area. Likewise he has not seen Mack Hanna for about 23 or more years, and suspects that he could be located in either Kentucky or Logan, WV. In the intervening years, Cataldo said that he has frequently told his family (wife, two sons and relatives) about the sight- ing. Cataldo said that aside from this present call, he has not been contacted by anyone regarding this, except for his discussion with reporter Natalie Chambers. He said that he has not seen the newspaper article, and would like to read it. He also said that he received a message from a friend telling him that Paul Harvey mentioned the story on his radio program recently, and wishes he could have heard it. I thanked Mike Cataldo for talking with me and told him that I would be happy to e-mail him the text of the newspaper article by Chambers. Although it is a disap- pointment to know that his claims were probably not docu- mented in a written report by his supervisor, further inter- views with Hanna and Peralta would still be valuable to provide some verification of this alleged sighting. A Yahoo People Search was conducted for their names in the specified locations, resulting in many returns, and as of this writing some of the names have already been contacted, but thus far with no success in finding the right individuals. Karl Pflock responds to review DearDwight: Many thanks for your very fair and lengthy review of my book Roswell: Inconvenient Facts and the Will to Believe (Journal, October 2001), which to my pleasant surprise is in its second printing. If I may, I'd like to address briefly for Journal readers' consideration cer- tain points that you raised. First, you wrote that you find it hard to believe officers like Col. Blanchard and Maj. Marcel could have been \"fooled by pieces of a Mogul balloon array\" into thinking they had pieces of a spacecraft from another world. So do I. But there's no doubt they thought the stuff they had was from a flying saucer. How do we explain this? In July 1947 \"flying saucer\" wasn't synonymous with '.'spaceship from another planet.\" Virtually everyone in and out of government who took UFOs seriously during the summer of 1947 and for some time thereafter was thinking in terms of advanced or at least unusual but very earthly technology, quite possibly some German super- gadgets captured and exploited by the Soviets. So pecu- liar assemblies of odd stuff of the sort flown by Charles Moore and his New York University team for Project Mogul certainly qualified as possible saucer stuff. Today's ufologists and UFO enthusiasts all too often make the grave error of-viewing the past through modern lenses, interpreting key elements of historical cases in terms of today's knowledge, theories, and generally ac- cepted \"norms,\" rather than in the context of the periods in which they occurred. This has been done in spades with respect to Roswell. Second, you doubt that the famous Roswell Army Air Field \"We've got one!\" press release was issued because RAAF commander Col. William Blanchard was a \"loose cannon,\" noting that if my \"version is accurate, we should worry a great deal about this nation's military.\" As you certainly know from your Air Force experience, Dwight, \"loose cannon\" doesn't necessarily mean \"bad officer.\" In my days in uniform and later as a senior congressional staffer and Pentagon official, I got to know and know of several high-ranking military men who could easily be considered and often were loose cannons. The great majority were inspiring leaders, first rate in their military specialties, etc.—but headstrong and all too inclined to shoot from the hip, following the beat of their different drummers. I need only name just a few famed .American military men to drive home the point: LeMay (Blanchard's \"rabbi\"), Patton, Grant (who didn't have Blanchard's good fortune in high-ranking patrons), Puller, Butler, Halsey—outstanding military leaders all, and all major pains in the rear ends of their civilian and military superiors.

I did not ask her what she meant by this advice. In one. sense it is good advice. We seem to be a long way from really understanding the UFO phenomenon; from a sci- entific point of view it would be unwise to get \"locked in\" on any one explanation at this point. But at the same time, if she means, \"We need to understand that the UFO aliens are not, and cannot be, either demons or angels,\" this I be- lieve is a mistake, because we certainly do not know at this point they are not angels or demons, or both, and much more. It would not be scientific to say to a student, \"I want you to add two plus two for me, but four is not an acceptable answer.\" As I have spent time with MUFON members, I have sensed among many a reluctance to face the clear reli- gious implications of the UFO phenomenon. Persons who have been in MUFON for a long time may feel betrayed by the aliens themselves. We started out chasing ETs. The extraterrestrial hy- pothesis seemed so clear and exciting, and it was good to be a \"true believer\" (in the scientific sense, of course), as opposed to those who supported the government lie, seeing UFOs as mistaken natural phenomena or the re- sult of a lot of unmet Jungian psychological and religious needs. Checking out stories of radar contacts, indenta- tions in the ground, and physical side effects of close en- counters such as body burns, all pointed to a physical UFO reality. But then came the abduction cases. And the betrayal began. The Betty Andreasson Luca case illustrates the betrayal well, and Raymond Fowler and his researchers led Betty through a hypnotic review of her abduction, which began like your average abduction-a back yard UFO land- ing, other family members seeing the UFO and being \"turned off,\" entities floating through a door, and Betty going off and beginning the \"interview\" process. And then the religious material enters the story-Betty About the author Dr. Barry Downing recently retired after serving for 34 years as pastor of Northminster Presbyterian Church in Endwell, NY. He earned the B.A. in Physics from Hartwick College, the B.D. from Princeton Theo- logical Seminary, and the Ph.D. from the University of Edinburgh, Scotland, in 1966, specializing in the relation- ship between natural science and Christian theology. He is the author of the ground-breaking book The Bible and Flying Saucers (1968, reprinted in 1970, 1973, 1974, 1989, and 1997), as well as numerous ar- ticles in Skylook, the MUFON UFO Journal, and elsewhere. Dr. Downing has been a speaker at several MUFON symposiums, and is currently on the national board of directors for the Fund for UFO Research (FUFOR). He has been a consultant in theology for MUFON since 1972. talking about Jesus, a phoenix shows up-the whole scene becomes religious and scientifically messy. 1 Your average MUFON scientific researchers feel be- trayed; they started out looking for ETs, but have landed in a huge religious drama. However, I believe it is here MUFON needs to be. Let us imagine this. An aircraft with its pilot is flying over a large island, populated by natives who believe they are the only intelligent beings in the universe. There have been reports of aircraft in the sky, but the reports have not been believed. On this island an independent organization called MUFON is formed, which investigates UFO reports. One day, the aircraft crashes, killing the pilot. The tribal lead- ers put the crashed aircraft and pilot in hiding, and turn them over to their best paid scientists for study, all of whom are sworn to secrecy. In the meantime, the MUFON group keeps trying to uncover the UFO mystery. It knows the government knows what is going on, and is probably spending millions, maybe billions, on UFO research. MUFON members ask themselves, why should we bother? Here is my reason why we should bother. Suppose that the aliens have power we cannot begin to imagine. Suppose that when the UFO crashes, and the alien pilot \"dies,\" his mind simply leaves his body and goes to a new body. Whitley Strieber has said that the aliens seem to be able to change bodies the way we would change clothes: \"I think that they must normally exist in some other state of being and that they use bodies to enter our reality as we use scuba gear to penetrate the depths of the sea.\" 2 In fact, perhaps the whole UFO crash was staged to give the natives a technological boost, as well as to make it clear to the natives they were not alone in the universe. (It has always seemed strange to me that a UFO might fly safely all the way from Andromeda, only to run out of gas over Roswell, NM, right next to an Air Force base-a little too much good luck for us; bad luck for Advanced aliens.) But now think of this. As we think of the UFO, the body of the pilot, and the mind of the pilot, which of the December, 2001 MUFON UFO Journal Page 11"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"three is of primary importance? Surely, the mind of the pilot If our government has crashed UFOs and dead alien bodies, MUFON cannot compete with the government research in this area, the area of the physical. But the alien mind, any more than our mind, is not physical. MUFON may be in a better position than our govern- ment to study the alien mind, provided that we suppose that modern UFO abduction stories are a window to the alien mind. For MUFON has members who say in public they believe UFOs are real, and that abductions can hap- pen. The government has said clearly, \"UFOs are not there; we do not even want to hear your story.\" People come to us with their abduction stories. It may well be that people like Budd Hopkins, David Jacobs, John Mack, Ann Druffel, and others know more about abduc- tions than our government. Keep in mind that our govern- ment UFO project has to be super secret-need to know basis only. But we can deal with all issues openly. Religion and the scientific method I know there are some MUFON members who are troubled by the religious dimension to the UFO phenom- enon, and the way I have handled this dimension. I be- lieve the appropriate way for MUFON to handle the reli- gious issue is scientifically: look at the evidence and form hypotheses. One possible description of the UFO reality might be this: UFOs and its humanoid alien associates may come from a single reality or multiple realities; it seems to be an intelligent form of energy which can materialize and de- materialize at will, as well as change shape, both the craft and the humanoids. There is a good possibility this reality is spatially interdimensional. This reality can interact with, and even control, both our conscious and unconscious minds, influencing our dreams, or putting our minds in an altered state of con- sciousness. It seems likely that many of the world's reli- gions have been caused by interaction with the UFO re- ality. In the past such a reality would have been called spiritual. Thus the \"God Hypothesis\" is a plausible hy- pothesis, based on the evidence, and our latest scientific understanding of the universe. The God Hypothesis would argue that UFOs are a divine manifestation-this is the reality that created and guides life on earth, and perhaps even created the universe. The extraterrestrial hypothesis is still plausible, but needs to be expanded. We need something like \"A Pretty Darn Big ET Hypothesis.\" One explanation of the religious di- mension might be what we could call the \"ETs Playing God\" hypothesis. This theory would be that ETs are not God, but they are so powerful they can trick us into think- ing they are God, which causes the religious response of Betty Andreasson Luca, Whitley Strieber, or many of the \"experiencers\" reported by John Mack. Thus exploring the biblical material, we might say that the \"pillar of cloud and fire\" of the Exodus was a UFO, controlled by aliens, who were \"playing God\" with the Jews, setting them free from slavery in Egypt, and lead- ing them into the wilderness, which served as a labora- tory away from all human life, to give them religious con- ditioning in the manner of behaviorist B.F. Skinner. Thus we end up in the strange state of finding that the \"miracles\" of traditional religion, like the parting of the Red Sea, could be true, but the theology drawn from them is not. As I said to a loud gasp at a dinner table at the MUFON International Symposium 2001, \"We are now in a strange position in relation to the Bible. We are in a position where we might find out everything in the Bible is true, except the part about God.\"  \" In some ways the \"ETs Playing God Hypothesis\" is not far from the Christian Fundamentalist argument that UFOs are demonic, except that if you are consistent in this argument, then you have to argue that both Moses and Jesus were tools of a demonic God, and in fact the religious leaders of his day accused Jesus of being in league with the prince of demons. (Matthew 9:34) I do not believe this is true-the demonic faith is not my \"faith\"-but from a scientific point of view, this is possible. And in the biblical religion, there are conflicting spiritual forces, God and the devil. It is possible that in 500 years we humans might have the power to part the Red Sea, or raise Jesus from the dead. That would make us god-like, but not God, as Eric Davis understands. But here is where I think we are. Many UFO abduc- tion cases make it clear that the alien reality, whatever it is, is capable of religious revelation. Although Budd Hopkins does not take this point of view, his book Wit- nessed: The True Story of the Brooklyn Bridge UFO Abductions makes clear what power the aliens have to control our minds, without us even knowing it. That being the case, the religious revelations recorded by John Mack must be taken seriously. Mack says that many of the revelations of his experiencers happen in an altered state of consciousness, which Davis would say relativity theory predicts. Mack explores the spiritual ex- periences of shamans such as Peixoto, Trueblood and Mutwa. Part of biblical tradition Altered states of consciousness are very much part of the biblical tradition, whether it be the divine revelation to Abraham while he was in a deep sleep (Genesis 15:12), or a strange spiritual power coming on 70 Jewish elders in the presence of the UFO of the Exodus (Numbers 11:16), or the same power coming on early Christians, causing them to speak in strange languages (Acts 2:1-4). Key religious leaders in the Bible such as Moses, Elijah, and Jesus seemed to have paranormal powers, which fits Mack's profile of shamans. The Islamic faith derives from the biblical tradition, since Muhammad lived about 600 years after Jesus, but Muhammad at an early age \"had an experience of a visi- tation by two figures (later identified as angels) who opened his chest and stirred their hands inside.'\" 3 More such ex- periences happened in his life, and led to the Islamic faith. For better or worse, all transcendent experiences, reported religious experiences, need to be examined as part of our UFO data. After careful examination, some of this data may be considered valid; other data will be discarded. Page 12 MUFON UFO Journal December 2001"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"Needless to say, this is a daunting task. Furthermore, in the past we have not recruited MUFON members who have specialized in this kind of analysis. We have tended to recruit consultants more from the hard sciences-engi- neering, physics, astronomy, chemistry, and medicine. These sciences would be helpful if we had a crashed UFO and some dead alien bodies to examine. I believe MUFON has to reevaluate its priorities, both in light of the way the UFO reality is manifesting itself to us, and in light of what we can do, perhaps better than the govern- ment can do. I believe the God Hypothesis is where we are. The alternative, ETs Playing God, is also possible, which in its most basic sense is a demonic theory. The situation has a lot of \"ambiguity,\" which as I have argued elsewhere is the nature of what I call \"God's Faith Game,\" 4 If it is true that understanding the alien mind is the most important task for UFO research, then MUFON is in a very important position in human culture. While our government is gathering up all the \"hardware,\" the \"soft- ware\" is kind of right there for us to take. But it will not be easy to take. John Mack has argued that to know the alien mind is really to want to know the sacred. 5 And as I have said of the God of the Bible, this God wants to keep space between us and him, between us and the alien mind. That is what I call \"The Rock of Ages Principle.\" 6 When God landed on Mt. Sinai, the people of Israel were under strict orders not to come near the mountain. The mountain was sacred, holy, because God was there. \"You shall set limits for the people all around, saying, 'Be careful not to go up the mountain or to touch the edge of it. Any who touch the mountain shall be put to death.'\" (Exodus 19:12) What are we doing if we are trying to study the alien mind? Are we also trying to study the mind of God? How careful do we have to be? Are there parts of our scien- tific mentality that are dangerous now? Is our scientific instinct to \"put the alien mind in a cage\" and study it dan- gerous? How do we come near the mountain of the alien mind without getting killed? And the biblical view is, if you do not understand the alien mind, you will die. (That is why religion matters, and why a major MUFON effort to understand the alien mind may matter a lot.) Imagine this. There is a cage full of rats. The cage has a black plastic cover on it. Every day, food comes down a chute into the cage. The rats have a debate about where they came from, where their food comes from. One group argues that God created them, and God creates their food, and puts it into the chute. The other group says that ev- erything just evolves over a period of time. One day there is a tear in the black plastic cover on the cage. Some of the rats (members of MUFON) look through the tear, and see a humanoid putting their food in the chute. Things are different now, and neither religious leaders nor scientific leaders will be happy about these differences. What do I think is the alien purpose now, how do I read the alien mind at this time? The August 13,2001, edition of USA Today carried a Nick Anderson cartoon. In the cartoon, a dark horse was running wildly away from its rider. Chasing it was a man holding an empty bridle. On the back of the man was the word \"Ethics,\" with words like \"cloning,\" \"stem cells,\" \"etc\" floating beside the man. On the side of the wild horse was written the word \"Sci- ence.\" I do not think we need any revelation from aliens to tell us human culture is in deep trouble. The cartoon explains the problem well. Science has given us great power over nature, but science has in effect told us we have just \"evolved,\" we have no created purpose. We are just ac- cidental bastards in an uncaring universe. And in a scien- tific culture in which religion has become a strange joke, the ethics that religion has traditionally taught have also become a joke. (For details, watch modem films and tele- vision.) If there is a unified alien purpose, I believe that pur- pose is to bring us back to what John Mack calls Source, what I call God, back to believing there is a spiritual real- ity that is more primary than our physical reality. If we do not see ourselves as spiritual beings with bodies, perhaps we cannot exercise an ethic to control our science. This is a more radical goal than the one I put forth in my article, \"Exodus as a Paradigm of UFO Strategy.\" 7 1 believe the aliens want to take us back to God without landing on the White House lawn. It is possible that a few thousand abductions a year will eventually achieve that goal. But at the same time, I think the aliens would be willing to use any justified power to achieve their goal. Accord- ing to the Bible, this power included killing all the first-born males in Egypt. That is how God \"put the final squeeze\" on Pharaoh. If the aliens decide to put the squeeze on the United States government, that is where MUFON might have a role. If UFOs started making open daylight appearances, then the squeeze would be on the public media. If the media did not publish what was obvious, they would lose credibility. If they did publish news of open sightings, then our government would lose credibility. As the media published news of open sightings, panic would begin. There would be space age panic, \"The ETs are going to land and take over,\" with books like David Jacob's The Threat fueling the panic, and there would be the religious fundamentalist panic: \"UFOs are demons. Armageddon is here.\" MUFON could be a calm voice-well, sort of calm- saying, \"We do not believe the UFOs plan to land and take over. We believe they just want us to admit they are real.\" If I am right, just setting Stanton Friedman's mes- sage \"Flying Saucers Are Real\" loose in human culture might be enough to save human culture. As I have said before, however, there is a lot of ambi- guity. But that is where the God Hypothesis has taken me up to this point. I believe reading the alien mind is MUFON's most important scientific challenge. Time will tell how good we are at our science.

Trainor, 51, a journalist and college graduate, had just gotten off the Duluth, MN, Transit Authority bus at the corner of Piedmont Ave. and W. Seventh St. at 5:20 p.m. on Dec. 12, 2000. He reports: \"It was dark, but there was still a glimmer of blue dusk at the summit of Spirit Mountain, on the western edge of the city. As I crossed Piedmont Ave. I looked downhill to my left and saw that the full moon had just risen. It was about 10 degrees above the eastern horizon, over Lake Superior and Park Point. It was very cold, about zero degrees Fahrenheit, and the sky was completely clear.\" He continues, \"As I passed the Lakeside Ice Co. build- ing, I saw what I thought was a Christmas decoration through the pine trees, an arch of multicolored lights. After walking about 100 feet west on West Seventh, I saw the object more clearly. \"It was a black triangle, with its apex pointed upward at a one o'clock angle, and the 'base' at the bottom. The object was in mid-air, an estimated 35 degrees above the southwestern horizon. It was the size of my thumbnail at arm's length. The color was matte black, a shade darker than the surrounding night sky. The object had no dis- cernible motion, and there was no sound. \"The sides of the triangle were slightly rounded,\" says Trainor, \"giving it the look of a bulky arrowhead. Also there were three sets, or arrays, of four lights each on either side of the triangle. There were no lights at the bottom. Twelve lights in all on either side. In descending order, the lights in each array were red, green, gold, and white.\" The witness says he stopped at the corner of W. Sev- enth and 22 nd Ave. West and observed the object for five minutes. \"It was hard to judge distance,\" he explains, \"but my guess is that the object was a few miles away. possibly over the Spirit Valley area in the West Duluth section of the city. I was alone on the street. There was intermittent traffic on Piedmont Ave. a block behind me. \"I walked to my own home, went inside, and grabbed a small camera.

Entity reported in Turkey AM ASYA — The Scientific Research Project of Tur- key UFO reports that on July 23,2001, an alien life form was observed in a 4th floor apartment at 9:30 p.m. on a hot evening. The creature's height was about three feet. He had very big jet black eyes, slanting up. The entity was ob- served for two seconds. His color was gray like smoke. The witness was breast-feeding her 5-month-old baby when she turned her head and saw the entity in front of the bal- cony door four floors up. Suddenly he disappeared. His head was oval-shaped and bald, and looked like it was formed of bones only. The witness called her hus- band, who did not see the entity. They kept the story secret until they learned others had seen UFOs the same night. Thanks to TUVPO liastar-0005@coopresources.net (Jeffrey M.

It sounded like a whistle at first, but became silent and came on again. It was similar to Morse Code. \"I saw at least a dozen lights on it that were various colors. I was talking on my cell phone at the time to my wife, telling her about this, and it was coming in kind of fuzzy. Then I heard a noise coming from my cell phone, (Maybe a transmission) and then it went dead a couple of seconds later. The noises I heard from the phone could have been a language, but I could not understand a word of it. After my phone went dead, the UFO left a few seconds later.\" Hungarian pilot videos disc-shaped object BUDAPEST — Jeff Rense has received a spectacu- lar video of a silver disk-shaped object. On Sept. 29,2001, the pilot reports that a strange craft was flying to his left side and then moved very fast past him in the clouds, as can be seen in the video. \"To my left I saw a bright metal aircraft that was the shape of a perfect disk,\" says the pilot. \"I was careful to film the object, not to try and chase it since it I could not match its speed. As I was flying a reconnaissance aircraft, I got the idea to film it, and used our equipment.\" The pilot considers the video he made to be his prop- erty and not the Hungarian government's, as he was fly- ing the plane while not on duty and was transporting it as a favor to save the government money. He has now hired an attorney and wants the video to be released to the public. He hopes the release of a few frames will make this happen. These spectacular photos can be seen at http://www.rense.com/generall5/pilotufo.htm. Thanks to Jeff Rense. Note: This appears to be a verified disc-shaped UFO of 25 to 30 feet in diameter. These have been filmed by numerous air forces of the world and have speeds greater than most jet fighter aircraft. Possible Los Alamos connection to crash James Parsons writes in the Star Beacon, \"Comes now a story out of Roswell and Los Alamos which may explain the three flights made from Roswell Army Air Field to Los Alamos on July 9,1947< a few days after the crash. This story is from Carol Syska, former director of the UFO Museum at Roswell during 1999 and most of 2000. Carol was a group secretary and division budget director at Los Alamos for almost 30 years. . \"One day at Los Alamos, she read that a report con- taining information about UFOs was available in the Lab library. This sounded interesting to Carol, so she ordered the report. She read this booklet, Project Blue Book, which contained some comments about wreckage from a crashed vehicle being sent for testing to Los Alamos. \"At the time (1962), Carol worked at the Lab with the NonDestructive Test Group (NDT). Her boss, a senior scientist, was head of NDT and had been with the Lab since the beginning of the Manhattan Project. If testing had been done on crash debris [whether from Roswell or elsewhere], Carol's boss would know about the tests. \"Carol went to the man's office and showed the report to him. She asked, 'Is this true?' Carol's boss, in a busi- ness-like manner, replied, 'What is the level of your secu- rity clearance?' Carol said, 'Sir, you know as well as I do what it is.' (Carol told me that at the time she held a Q clearance. A Q clearance is a very high National Secu- rity clearance.) \"Carol's boss, after a pause, said, 'Well, do you have the need to know?' Carol said, 'Guess not,' and moved to the door. Carol's boss said, 'Just a minute.' After another pause, he added, 'I would advise you to read everything you ever see about this subject.'\" Thanks to James Par- sons, Nov.

Arizona flying triangle PHOENIX — I was sitting out side of the shop I work at on Oct. 19, 2001, and was having a smoke about 8:45 p.m., watching the sky, which was hazy but clear enough to see stars. There was a light layer of clouds coming from the west out of California. I suddenly caught a glimpse of something flying over my head. \"I looked up to see a group of three reddish/orange, somewhat bright yet fuzzy looking lights flying at what seemed to be couple of hundred feet above my head, but completely silent. It traveled at a very fast speed from east to west across the sky towards Luke Air Force Base. This took a total of about 6 to 8 seconds. Just as it was passing over the top of the roof of the house, my recep- tionist looked out the door and said, 'What's that?' I was describing it to her and all of a sudden a boomerang-shaped cloud traveling the same direction was moving across the sky at an extremely fast speed too. The other clouds that were in the sky never changed; they were in the same place as they were when the event started.\" Thanks to Peter Davenport www.ufocenter.com Washington flying triangle BUCKLEY — According to the witness, two slow- moving flying triangle-shaped objects with blue, white, and red lights, with very bright strobes in unison, along with bigger white lights at 3 points, were spotted on Oct. 24,2001. The two craft were headed south, slightly above a low broken cloud cover at 8:05 p.m.. The craft were about one mile apart, with one trailing back about 60 degrees east of the other. As their strobes flashed, a faint outline appeared to reveal a solid triangle, rather than a conventional wing. Their altitude was about 1500 feet. There were distinct bright red, blue, and white lights in line on the trailing edge of both craft. There were no red or green strobes in con- ventional positions on the craft, and no landing lights or a similar typical arrangement apparent. The witness states, \"This was not at all the typical type of light arrangement, as I'm accustomed to light airplane traffic, commercial traffic to and from SeaTac, and military traffic to McCord Air Force Base. I'm not familiar with this light arrange- ment, and there was no engine noise. Commercial flight from SeaTac at 2020 hours with takeoff lights and con- ventional configuration of lights flew over just west of my house, well above the other objects, with engine noise very clear.\" Thanks to Peter Davenport www.ufocenter.com Trucker \"misplaces\" 300 miles in Wyoming EVANSTON — A trucker driving through Wyoming observed an oblong green glassy object starting at 11 p.m. on Oct. 24, 2001.

The object stayed nearby until 4 a.m., and he indicates that he misplaced 300 miles of this trip. Later the trucker was buzzed by a helicopter shortly after the last contact. (NUFORC Note: The witness chooses to remain anonymous, but reported that the sighting was rather dra- matic, and that other truckers on the same highway prob- ably were witness to the event.

It seems almost a con- spiracy that investigators would chase the dream of getting their hands on the nuts and bolts and smoking guns of the UFO, while we, the living evidences of the presence, were ges- tating in the miracle wombs of change. Abductees are like children... .As we toddled, disoriented in a world that ignored us for the dazzle of new technologies, muse-babble was our language. But now we are beginning to find our voices...\" Dana Redfield, an accomplished author of fiction, has written her second work of non-fiction, The ET-Human Link: We Are The Message. The quote above is from her new book. Many people will recall her first nonfiction book, Summoned: Encounters with Alien Intelligence, during which she tested the waters of a new reality emerg- ing, and for the first time shared some of her encounters with non-human intelligences with the public. I read Dana's first book of nonfiction, and to me it seems that she has grown spiritually and has become stron- ger and more resilient than she probably ever thought she could. She has taken the next step in her mission, if we may call it that, and has now gone public with in-depth information about her experiences, her private life, and feelings about her place in the world. Jenny Randies has written the Foreword for this book, and it is a \"must read.\" Ms. Randies has done a superb job of preparing the reader for his or her journey into Dana Redfield's life. The ET-Human Link is a beauti- fully written book, but like many experiencers' lives, it is a very complex story. It is a story that will ask you to think about our world in the context of what is happening to those of us who have experienced interaction with non- human beings., Some of the beings with whom Dana has interacted are physical extraterrestrials, some are inter-dimensional, and some appear to be spiritual beings. Dana prefers to call them the Others. This book will also ask you to con- sider subjects you may not be comfortable with, such as the existence of other dimensions, channeling, and past lives. I have just used two terms that make a lot of people uncomfortable. I will admit that when I read this book there were parts of it I had a hard time accepting. I have read next to nothing about new age subjects, but many people who do not believe my experiences will laugh at this because to them, alien abductions are \"new age.\" Today, I am not even certain what that term means any more. Wisely, Jenny Randies writes: \"If you are skeptical, then that is fair enough, provided you are willing to give room to the possibility that your skepticism may be misplaced. If you are a believer, try not to merely accept what you read as being true, but to question other possibilities and consider other meanings. If you have had strange experiences for yourself, then appreciate the courage it takes to reveal them and face the rebukes that will surely follow.\" Who among us who has gone public has not had to deal with everything the last sentence implies? Yet, even knowing this from her past experiences, Dana presses forward and tells all. Dana shares with us information she received before Summoned was written, but she felt the information was too fantastic to believe. She wrestled with when and how and why she should share much of the information in this book, and I commend her for her courage. If the informa- tion she received from the Others is true, there is a very important message in this book. Redfield writes, \"They summoned, They whisked me up, They made their marks on my hands, triangles cut into my skin to show me the body is a divine link, a temporal home away from Home for my soul who remembers what I the human have forgotten, except as I can translate the signs.\" Dana writes about abduction events that we have come to learn occur to most abductees. However, like most abduction cases, there is much more to this story and much more to this person's life than a standard set of events. Dana Redfield was a devout Mormon. She held a \"Q\" (Top Secret) clearance while working at the Nevada Test Site. She has overcome great difficulties during her life, some that many people would not be able to endure, much less conquer. Because Dana succeeded, she was able to write The ET-Human Link. It is a life-story that encompasses the principles of belonging, gathering, and becoming. There is also philosophy in this book, beautifully writ- ten stories within stories, information about the contro- versial lost continent of Atlantis, a revisit of the Bible, the exploration of human DNA, and soul evolution. Some of these subjects went beyond what my mind readily ac- cepts. However, just as others have asked people to con- sider the reality of abductions by non-human beings, or that structured alien seeming craft have been seen by millions of people, it is important to consider the reality of Dana Redfield's experiences. Perhaps the following will give you an example of one of the feelings about this book I am trying to convey: In 1986, before I read anything about UFOs, much less their occupants, before I knew ufology even existed- before it all-I wrote in my dream journal about something I believed happened to me during my childhood. It kept coming back to me as a recurring dream over a period of 20-plus years. It involved me traveling to another world, December, 2001 MUFON UFO Journal Page 17"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"of being with people who wore long white robes, of being in a place that (for some reason) I believed was Atlantis. I could not share my feelings about Atlantis with anyone when I wrote my, book because by that time I had put such childhood nonsense aside, but I did publish the expe- rience in my book. To this date, I still have no idea how as a very young child in the 1960s I would have known any- thing at all about Atlantis. Here it was again it seemed, out of the blue, in Dana's book The ET-Human Link. As she shared her feelings about Atlantis and of another place she used to call Home, I saw this place that has been a part of my memory since my very early childhood. I cannot say if it was really Atlantis, a past life, or some sort of unusual abduction, but how did this become part of Dana Redfield's past as well? I thought this was from my life. Could we really be re- membering a similar place in time? A place from our past? Did we have the same abduction? This brings me to a new idea and term I came across in this book. It is called a \"metafractal,\" a connection between experiences and metaphors and events in a person's life. Could the story of our Home or of this ex- perience be a metafractal of Dana's life and my life? Many abductees have spoken of a place they call Home. What if it is our real home? This book made me wonder if all of us are not from this same place. I wonder if we are not going to go back to this place one day and if we are to help others get there. I wonder.. .and I wonder. Perhaps that is what I liked most about this book. It made me wonder .again. I haven't done that in a very long time. For the past ten years many other experiencers of this phenomenon and myself have been snaring our knowledge with the public. We have given it to the world and handed it out on the proverbial silver platter. What we received in return was never-ending diatribes from the proud skeptics and the almost insane logic from the debunkers. Some of us have been threatened. All of us have been ridiculed. However, we know that something profound has happened to us, and we know that the truth will prevail. A couple of years ago I came to a place in my life where I was beginning to think, \"I'm nothing but an alien lab rat-why should I believe anything they tell me? What have they done for us? Look at all of the disbelievers there still are in ufology, not to mention the rest of the world. Where has it gotten us except exposed and ridi- culed and made vulnerable?\" The ET-Human Link brought me back to my begin- ning in a way. It reminded me of something I had while I was writing my book. It reminded me of my mission. It reminded me that when one of us gets tired, there is a kindred spirit to pick up the load and to help us fulfill our \"duty\"-that task we are supposed to perform, and the one that got us into this in the first place. That task is something else you will learn about when you read The ET-Human Link. This is probably what the Others in- tended when Dana was tapped to write this book. I cannot tell you if past lives or channeling are real or if Atlantis existed. I do not know how to get them on tape for the skeptics. I don't know how to bring a piece of Atlantis or an extraterrestrial body, back for the debunk- ers to find hiding places for. I can say that I believe Dana Redfield is having contact with extra-terrestrial or inter- dimensional beings. If they sometimes speak to her with- out showing themselves and we wish to call it channeling, then I guess that is the way they choose to interrelate with her, and channeling is the human term for this type of interrelating. Dana Redfield is one of many people on this planet who have a special link to these mysterious beings. There has been a special time for each stage of the message. Each part of the message is built upon the previous mes- sage and The ET-Human Link may well be the next im- portant message in our understanding of these elusive beings. -Katharina Wilson is the author of The Alien Jigsaw, The Alien Jigsaw Researcher's Supplement, and a monograph, Project Open Mind, http://www.alienjigsaw.com UFO MYSTERIES UFO Mysteries: a Reporter Seeks the Truth by Curt Sutherly, Llewellyn Publications, P.O.

Reviewed by Dwight Connelly Sutherly is a very good writer, as one would expect from a professional journalist, but what sets this book apart is the fact that much of it is tied to his own experi- ences. While many of the cases are old, much of the information is new, as are the insights provided by Sutherly, a perceptive observer. The book begins with the Kenneth Arnold sighting in 1947, and most readers will find the background experi- ences of Arnold new and quite interesting. But it was the 1964 Lonnie Zamora case that got the then 13-year-old Sutherly firmly hooked on ufology. The UFO cases continued through the 1960s, of course, and the author details those most important to him. He continues with cases from the 1970s, including some in- teresting incidents involving objects that found their way into bodies of water. In mid-1989 the author, now firmly grounded in the field, was asked to write a \"comprehensive piece\" on the validity of the Majestic 12 documents. This led him into an investigation covering not only documents, but also in- teractions with such key players as Stanton Friedman, William Moore, and Philip Klass. This journalistic effort is quite interesting, and Sutherly seems to have tentatively concluded that the documents could have been part of an effort by some element of the government to discredit, fragment, and confuse ufologists-that is, part of a disinformation campaign. As for Roswell, one of the key elements in the MJ-12 package, he concludes, \"The only thing for certain is that something happened in the desert in 1947: something im- 4. Page 18 MUFON UFO Journal December 2001"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"portant, something requiring military intervention and a heavy mantle of secrecy.\" Sutherly also looks at secret development projeci s. :>IK h as the SR-71, as well as recounting his experiences in trying to approach Area 51, the secret base where devel- opment and testing are supposedly done-also known as Groom Dry Lake or \"Dreamland.\" In considering the possibility that some objects identi- fied as UFOs are actually secret U.S. aircraft, Southerly questions why such aircraft would be tested over heavily- populated areas. He suggests as a possibility that what appear to be unidentified objects in the sky may in some cases be holograms projected by those wanting to de- ceive and confuse witnesses and ufologists. This scenario fits into what seems to be one of Sutherly's key conclusions: many UFO cases and events have been staged by elements of the government for their own pur- poses. The author also includes an informative chapter on Mars and the various probes to the Red Planet, as well as one on shapeshifting UFOs. In the latter chapter he con- cludes, \"When it comes to the nature of UFOs there is, however, one undeniable truth that stands above all the theories. This truth is that regardless of what we wish to believe, we are still all just guessing. We really do not know what UFOs are, where they come from, or why some of them appear to change shape or indeed do any of the amazing things they have been reported doing.\" Perhaps the most interesting chapter is \"The Gather- ing,\" where Sutherly describes his associations with other ufologists at the 26 th Annual National UFO & New Age Conference in Phoenix in 1989. As anyone who has ever participated actively in such conferences knows, most of the really interesting activi- ties and interactions occur away from the main speaker sessions. At this particular conference were James Moseley, Tim Beckley, Antonio Huneeus, Brad Steiger, and others with extensive backgrounds and many stories. Included in the book is a three-part appendix, and the 18-page Appendix 2 is made up of \"A Catalog of Trian- gular UFO Reports,\" a nice addition which details such reports from 1989 through 1999. Presumably there will also be an index and additional photos in the regular edi- tion of the book. (My \"unconnected proof review copy of the book has only 200 pages of the 264 pages that the regular edition is supposed to contain.) This is an interesting look at some key elements of the UFO field over the past half century by a qualified author, and at $ 12.95 is a good buy.

It's there, plain as day, along the edges of the target panels, folded over the struts and secured to the panels. True, the symbols aren't visible, but then consider the testimony of both former NYU/Mogul team members and witnesses who saw the debris discovered by rancher Mack Brazel: these purplish-pink markings were rather faint. Clearly, the glare of the photographers' flashbulbs washed them out, leaving the tape looking bright while. Fourth, you assert that \"the military actually provided unnecessary publicity to the Mogul project following the 'corrected'press release.\" Not so. I assume the public- ity you refer to was the demonstration of the alleged \"study and training\" activities of the \"Watson Laboratories AMC experimental group for long range radar detection,\" con- ducted at Alamogordo Army Air Base on July 9, 1947. Of course there was no such group. The demonstra- tion was a very clever attempt to capitalize on the world- wide excitement generated by flying saucer sighting re- ports to provide cover for Mogul, as well as Gen. Ramey's weather-balloon-and-radar-target \"explanation\" of the night before: \"See? The saucers are weather balloons, our weather balloons, and this is what we're using them for.\" This had the added and all but certainly unintended bonus of significantly deflating serious press interest in saucers. Seep. 150 and associated footnotes of my book. Finally, I come to the formerly classified record, which I am convinced demonstrates beyond any reasonable doubt that Roswell didn't involve the recovery of a crashed sau- cer and the bodies of its crew. You write that \"it would be interesting to know precisely when each of these docu- ments was actually released to researchers.\" In my chap- ter 15, wherein I discuss these documents at length, I note the dates they were declassified, most of which are the same as the dates they were released to researchers. Moreover, many of these documents were released well before enactment of the Freedom of Information Act, for example: Lt. Gen. Nathan Twining's famous letter of Sept. 23, 1947 (in which he noted \"the lack of physical evidence in the shape of crash recovered exhibits\"), re- (Continued on Page 22) December, 2001 MUFON UFO Journal Page 19"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"View from Britain By Jenny Randies Reflection on where we are in ufology Part II: What next? So where do we go from here? The point of learning lessons is to do something about things that seem wrong and try to do things better. But, of course, you first have to admit that the current methods are not working. I think that ought to be self evident, but I doubt many of you agree; otherwise we would not still be arguing about it. We would be implementing big changes to the struc- ture and approach of UFOIogy to replace the methods that have patently failed for so long with new ideas that just might work. At least we would if we do not want to still be having the same discussion years from now. Unfortunately, I fear, some people may actually prefer that. UFOIogy is fun as a mys- tery. But as a collection of solved mysteries its an ex sub- ject! However, if we are seri- ous about learning lessons and progressing, I have in previous columns suggested some ways we might go. For instance, recall when I discussed the need for far more meaningful conferences than the ones that we have today. UFO conferences are not used as opportunities to further research, but as social gatherings. Whilst I do not deny that the latter are fun and also useful, without the progressive breed of conference, UFOIogy will just con- tinue to stagnate. Sadly there is precious little sign that this nettle will be grasped. I also think that we need to reassess what kind of evi- dence we are seeking. In fact, in some ways, these days hard evidence for UFOs has almost become an irrel- evance. It has not been very forthcoming in the past, so people have stopped looking for it. Where today is the flood of cases involving landing traces, physiological ef- fects, car stops, and so on? People seem to have lost interest in reporting or researching these. Instead we are swamped with dubious videos for TV specials, most of which show useless squiggles of largely explicable light, or we pursue vaguer questions such as the meaning behind abduction stories. I do not deny that these are part of UFOIogy, but I do wonder aout priorities. That, to me, has been one of our greatest mistakes. We are concentrating far too much Jenn> Randies effort on having theoretical arguments about phenomena that are unreproducible and unprovable. Whilst I do not suggest there is no place for this kind of exploration, it has overtaken objective research to such a degree that virtu- ally none of the latter is taking place. We need to recon- sider our objectives and ask just what it is that we are trying to establish. For whatever we think it is right now, we are not succeeding in doing it, and an admission of that will be the first step on the way towards progression. There is a fascination with the great unknown that sees us obsessed with the big issues, such as trying to per- suade the powers that be to disclose things which in my estimation they cannot do. I believe that they know less than we do about what is going on, and once they have disclosed that reality-if indeed anyone will believe them (and indeed they already have, and most UFOlogists re- main distrustful)-then it is pretty much a massive waste of energy to hunt down nonexistent conspiracies. Fun as seeking smoking guns might be, we would be far better employed seeking smoking UFOs. What we should be doing is returning to basics using the vastly improved technology of the 21 st century to aid in our quest. Ghost hunters, for example, have moved with the times. They are not sitting around counting their stories about phantoms or demanding that the Pentagon open up their spook files so as to reveal the truth! Ask yourself why. But you will not like the answer! Instead, ghost hunters have developed technology to take account of some of the patterns they have found within apparitional data. They have devices that mea- sure changes in the moisture content of a room, alter- ations in electrostatic fields, and cameras adapted to re- spond by automatically filming a location where these changes are occurring. Yet in UFOIogy we are still by comparison very lazy. We sit here waiting for a spaceship to crash or the gov- ernment to do our job for us by revealing \"the truth.\" In fact the government has way more important things to do these days than fret about UFOs. That is supposed to be our job. After 30 years I reckon it is about time we started doing it. Larry Hatch develops UFO wave years map Larry Hatch has put up a new UFO map on the *U* Website: http://www.larryhatch.netAVAVLAYER.html. It features an overlay of three separate UFO wave years in theUSA(1947, 1957, 1973), layered as separate colored sightings-dots. Hatch notes, \"Each of those waves taken separately seems to favor certain U.S. regions over others. What seems new is that the three years taken together, and excluding all other years, seem to blanket the USA al- most completely.\" The same map is shown on George Filer's website. http://www.filersfiles.com/ufo/ufodatabase.htm, color-en- hanced for clarity.

Friedman The pseudoscience test The November 2001, issue of Scientific American (p.36) has a column by Dr. Michael Shermer entitled \"Ba- loney Detection.\" Shermer is the Founding Publisher of Skeptic magazine, and is much younger than the old line skepticbunkers to which ufologists have become accus- tomed, such as Philip Klass. He provides the following rules for testing to see whether claims about unusual phenomena are pseudoscience, or science, and unintentionally provides a means for evaluating debunker views as well: (in summary) \"1. How reliable is the source of the claim? Pseudoscientists of- ten appear quite reliable, but when examined closely, the facts and figures they cite are distorted, taken out of context, or occasion- ally even fabricated.\" \"2. Does this source often make similar claims? Pseudoscientists have a habit of going well beyond the facts.\" \"3. Have the claims been verified by another source? Typically, pseudoscientists make statements that are un- verified or verified only by a source within their own be- lief circle\" \"4. How does the claim fit with what we know about how the world operates? An extraordinary claim must be placed into a larger context to see how it fits.\" \"5. Has anyone gone out of the way to disprove the claim, or has only supportive evidence been sought? This is the confirmation bias, or the tendency to seek confir- matory evidence and to reject or ignore disconfirmatory evidence.\" Here are some claims about UFOs that we can put through Shermer's tests: A. \"The reliable cases are uninteresting and the inter- esting cases are unreliable. Unfortunately there are no cases that are both reliable and interesting.\" Dr. Carl Sagan, astronomer, Other Worlds, Bantam, 1975, p. 113. B. \"On the basis of this study we believe that no ob- jects such as those popularly described as flying saucers have overflown the United States. I feel certain that even the unknown 3% could have been explained as conven- tional phenomena or illusions if more complete observa- tional data had been obtained.\" Donald A. Quarles, Sec.

D. \"Almost every sighting is either a mistake or a hoax. These reports are riddled with hoaxes, and the flying sau- cer enthusiasts have so many cranks, freaks, and nuts among them that Hynek is constantly running the risk of innocently damaging his reputation by being confused with them.\" Dr. Isaac Asimov, author, Fantasy and Science Fiction, Feb. 1975 p. 132. E. \"The unexplained sightings are simply those for which there is too little information to provide a solid fac- tual basis for an explanation\" Ben Bova, editor Analog, December 1975, p. 172. These statements by eminent men all have some things in common: a.) None provide any data to substantiate them, b.) None reference any data to substantiate them, c.) All are demonstrably false, as can be easily deter- mined from Tables I and II, the data being taken from Project Blue Book Special Report No. 14, (Ref. 1), the largest UFO study ever done for the US Air Force. Quarles was talking about BBSK 14, Menzel had a copy, and Sagan, Bova, and Asimov had been given the data.

Col. Philip Corso's The Day After Roswell (TDAR), I exposed the fact that Corso had pulled a bait and switch on Sen. Thurmond (R-SC). Corso, who had worked for Thurmond for two brief periods in the 1960s and '70s, had given the senator an outline of his memoirs, grandly entitled / Walked With Giants {My Career in Military Intelligence), asking him to pen a foreword for the book. The senator did, and much to his chagrin, his brief, plain-vanilla comments-laudatory of Corso, but containing nothing specific about the book itself-found their way into the first printing of The Day After Roswell. When I saw the senator's name and foreword in the Friedman...

Backup comes only from claims from their circles. These extraordinary claims clearly do not fit in the larger world dependent upon data and evidence. Hence they are all, by Shermer's definitions, PSEUDOSCIENCE, or, more simply, Baloney. Ref. 1.

Thurmond's staff was stunned, and in short order, the senator contacted S&S, told them what had happened, and demanded that his foreword and name be removed from further print- ings of the book and not be used in any way to further promote it. The embarrassed publisher quickly complied. The Oct.-Nov. 2001 UFO magazine (U.S.) carries a fatuous attempt to rehabilitate Corso and, by implication, UFO's publisher, William J. Birnes, who coauthored TDAR with Corso: \"Honor Restored: The 'De-Pflocked' Facts About Philip Corso,\" by Don Ecker, the 'zinc's di- rector of research. Ecker recently posted the text of this gem on UpDates, conveniently not including the illustra- tions. The most important of these is a Simon & Schuster release form signed by Senator Thurmond, allegedly giv- ing his permission for Corso's publisher to use his fore- word in TDAR. The form as reproduced in UFO has the words \"Roswell Book\" typed in the blank left in the boilerplate text of the form for a book title, with the other blanks, for \"undersigned\" and \"author,\" left, well, blank. I made a copy of Ecker's piece available to Senator Thurmond's chief of staff, and a few days ago I received in return copies of several very interesting items. One of these is the release form in the senator's office file, on which ALL the blanks in text are, well, blank. No \"under- signed,\" no \"author,\" but, most important, no book title, not even the generic \"Roswell Book.\" This clearly is the same form reproduced in UFO, as the senator's signature and date of signing nukh-but it is as it was when the original left the senatoi s ottice, BE- FORE someone (gee, wonder who?) typed in \"Roswell Book.\" Hmmm... Along with this revealing document, I received the com- plete outline for / Walked With Giants, wherein nary a word about UFOs or Roswell (incident or town) is found. A perusal of this outline and a reading of the senator's foreword leave no doubt in any reasonable mind that the latter was intended for the outlined proposed memoir, not the ufoological (NOT a typo) dream to which it was ap- propriated. Other than the inclusion of many of the non-UFO- connected tall tales and pulp-fiction prose that appeared in and animated TDAR, the only resemblance between the proposed book and what finally saw prmi is Corso's Walter Mittyish ego strutting across the pa^es Also included in the package were ihe senator's June 5,1997, press release about the matter ( Right Foreword, Wrong Book\"), and his June 11, 1997, letter to Simon & Schuster Deputy General Counsel Eric Raymond, demand- ing the removal of his misappropriated foreword from TDAR. I will not engage in further debate on this matter, but will be glad to provide copies of any or all of these docu- ments to anyone who's interested enough to cover the cost of copying and mailing. Those who'd like the full details of the Right Foreword, Wrong Book Caper will find them in Chapter 16 of my book. -Karl Pflock Page 22 MUFON UFO Journal December 2001"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"TheMIGHLSKY PJ» H>\" I W ,J IBM ,„ ^ Walter N. Webb January 2002 Bright Planets (Evening Sky): Mercury is at a point farthest from the Sun on Jan. 11. For at least the first half of the month, the dim orange planet can be detected low in the WSW after sunset. Use binoculars to help locate it. On the 15th the planet is about 10 degrees to the lower right of the crescent Moon. Mars (magnitude 0.9), in Pisces, lies in the SSW at dusk and sets in the W about 10 p.m. The lunar crescent is below the reddish planet on Jan. 18. Jupiter (-2.7), retrograding in Gemini, reaches a point opposite the Sun on New Year's Day. At that time it rises in the NE around sunset, moving westward in the south- ern half of the sky during the night. A bright gibbous Moon hangs below the giant planet on the 26th. Saturn (-0.1), retrograding near the star Aldebaran and the Hyades in Taurus, stands high in the ESE at twi- light. It then advances westward during the night. In a small telescope the giant's ring system is tilted at a 26- degree angle, with its S face exposed to our view. On Jan. 24, at dusk, the gibbous Moon forms a nice triangle with Saturn and Aldebaran. Bright Planets (Morning Sky): Jupiter sets in the NW around sunrise. Saturn sets in the WNW about 4 AM in midmonth. Moon Phases: Last quarter—Jan. 5 New moon—Jan. 13 First quarter--Jan. 21 Full moon-Jan. 28 The Stars: The Great Hunter Orion brightens the southern sky of winter. Look for an hourglass-shaped stick figure whose shoulders, head, belt, sword, and legs are clearly marked by stars. As the constellation faces the observer, the ruddy star Betelgeuse (rhymes with \"beetlejuice.\" one of sev- eral pronunciations) positions the warrior's right shoulder while blue-white Rigel indicates his left leg. The trio of stars in a row forming the belt is particularly noticeable. And below the belt can be seen the wispy Great Nebula of Orion, introduced last month. To Orion's right lies the brightest (nocturnal) star Sinus in Canis Major the Big Dog. To the hunter's left, the fiery orange eye of Taurus the Bull, Aldebaran, glares at Orion. The face of the bull is outlined by the V-shaped cluster called the Hyades, while the Pleiades cluster or \"Seven Sisters\" represents a spear wound in the bull's shoulder. The Hyades, by the way, comprises a moving associa- tion of stars drifting together through space, eventually converging toward a point east of Betelgeuse. Aldeba- ran, however, is not a member of the group, being more than twice as close to us than the Hyades. The orange star merely lies in front of the cluster from our viewpoint. The Big Dipper comes into better view in the NE, now balanced on the end of its handle. April 12-14, 2002, 14th Annual Ozark UFO Con- ference, Inn of the Ozarks. Eureka Springs. AR May 11, 2002.

Journal Production Schedule Delivery of the MUFON UFO Journal has been some- what erratic since the horrible events of 9-11 and the days that followed, so we are recap- ping the production schedule so you may be clear on what we are trying to do. Dwight Connelly, our dedi- cated and hard-working editor, prepares the next month's Journal for production around the 18 lh of the current month and sends it to B-W Graphics in Versailles, MO. The membership database is closed out in parallel with the delivery of the edited Jour- Hrt/text. Therefore, new and renewal subscriptions must be received at the Headquarters office by the last day of the month in order to be in the membership database for the next Journal issue. The B-W Graphics team goes to work immediately to set the issue up for publication, printing, folding and sta- pling. The next step consists of preparing the issue for the mailing process, and that includes labeling, sorting, packaging and delivery to the U.S. Post Office in Stover, MO. Mailing generally occurs about the middle of the month (i.e. the November issue was mailed on Nov. 15 lh ). Un- less a subscriber pays extra to have the Journal mailed via first class mail in an envelope, all Journals go by second-class mail. Before 9-11, this was a simple and efficient process. Since that date, the Journal reaches some U.S. subscrib- ers in about five days, but it may take up to three weeks in some parts of the country, and we have no control over that. Subscribers residing outside of the United States are finding it may take 60-80 days to get their Journals. We do hope that mail deliveries will improve as the world gets back to some semblance of normalcy. John Schuessler Position Announcements Vincent H. Uhlenkott.
