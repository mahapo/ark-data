FROM THE EDITOR Carl Sagan takes his lumps in this issue, as well he might, for talking about things of which he knows little.. .a \"talent\" that has paylayed him into being the premier U.S. pop scientist. I have three basic mental pictures of Sagan: testifying in the 1968 Congressional UFO Symposium as if UFOs posed a threat to his special pleading for funds to support radio telescope searches for extraterrestrial life (I was in the audience); ridiculing the 1973 Pascagoula, Mississippi, case to a group primarily consisting of NASA personnel at Goddard Space Flight Center (I was in the audience); and arguing from theory to debunk UFOs on a national TV program, until it came time for another guest to talk — Lt. Col. Lawrence Coyne whose helicopter had nearly collided with a structured UFO over Ohio in 1973 — at which point Sagan clammed up. His almost visible message was, \"Don't disturb me with facts, my mind is made up.\" In this issue MUFON FEATURED ON NATIONWIDE BROADCAST 3 PHYSICAL EVIDENCE FOR UFOs IN AUSTRALIA 4 By Bill Chalker AIR FORCE \"PUZZLED\" BY SOCORRO  6 By Richard Hall A {CLASSICAL ENCOUNTER   7 By Quentin Fogarty UFO AND OCCUPANTS (Prospect Heights, Illinois) 9 By Ted Bloecher CALIFORNIA REPORT (\"Open Letter to Carl Sagan\")....... 13 By Ann Druffel LETTERS     16 IN OTHER'S WORDS    19 By Lucius Parish DIRECTOR'S MESSAGE   20 By Walt Andrus The contents of The MUFON UFO JOURNAL are determined by the editor, and do not necessarily represent the official position of MUFON.

Maccabee, Fund for UFO Research Chairman (also Maryland State Director for MUFON), and Don Berliner, inde- pendent researcher and Fund execu- tive committee alternate. The pro- gram is carried nationally by 228 radio stations and has an audience averaging 6 million people, more on Friday nights since it is aired from midnight to 5:00 a.m. (E.S.T.) After 3:00 a.m., King changes the format to \"Open Line America\" and accepts calls on any topic. The UFO program was arranged by popular request, according to the producer. The first hour consisted of an interview with the panelists, then phone calls were taken for two hours. In order to accept as many questions as possible, King prods the callers to get to the point and the guests to give concise answers. During the two hours 58 calls were taken, or an average of about one call every two minutes. The calls came from 24 states. About 9 callers mentioned personal UFO sightings, and most were of above average interest. Wit- nesses and others with information or help to offer were invited to write to MUFON. Although some skeptical questions were asked, the caliber of questions and questioners was high (including a sprinkling of professionals such as scientists, professors, and military officers.) Only one caller was out- right hostile: a retired Navy Com- mander from Reston, Virginia, who said he was a former assistant to the Director of the Central Intelligence Agency. He claimed that high alti- tude flights of the U-2 \"spy plane\" caused the 1947 UFO wave. After responses that the U-2 wasn't built until much later (in fact, not until 1955) and that 1947 witnesses had 1. to r., Bruce Maccabee, Larry King, Don Berliner, Richard Hall (Photo: Fred Whiting) seen formations of round objects, many (including Kenneth Arnold) at below mountaintop level, he re- torted, \"You fellows are full of mal- arkey.\" The show format, though it keeps the program moving at a brisk pace, unfortunately doesn't allow time for more complete discussion or rebut- tal on a particular point. Neverthe- less, activities of both MUFON and the Fund were publicized and the addresses were given repeatedly. Serious UFO groups oriented toward scientific investigation seldom are able to reach national audiences. We are grateful to Larry King for this opportunity. MUFON 1030LDTOWNE RD.

The Executive Committee of the Fund, located in the Greater Wash- ington, D.C., area, has authority to expend up to $1,000 for \"prompt preliminary investigation\" of any new case that promises to have scien- tific yield. If you obtain physical trace evi- dence, witnesses with UFO-related injuries, or similar data that lends itself to scientific testing or docu- mentation, call Publicity Director Fred Whiting (703) 683-2786 and in his absence leave a message on his an- swering machine. Someone from the Fund will contact you by tele- phone. The Executive Committee can confer by telephone, and if it agrees that the case warrants it, money can be forwarded within a short period of time to assure prompt analysis or documentation. 3"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"PHYSICAL EVIDENCE FOR UFOs IN AUSTRALIA By Bill Chalker (Bill Chalker is scientific consultant for the Australian Co-ordination Section of the Center for UFO Studies, Director of UFOR-NSW, and MUFON Representative for NSVi-Australia. Following is an ex- cerpt from a paper he presented at UFOCON 4, Artarmon, Sydney, NSW, .Australia,. October 13, 1979. Edited by . Mildred Biesele.) Without question, the study of the UFO subject has been made very difficult because of the strong tidal forces of controversy that have punc- tuated its contemporary history. It is the nature and extent of the phenom- enon that has bred this situation. Accordingly, we have an intriguing dilemma. On the one hand we have a strong measure of public accep- tance for the possibility of UFOs, and on the other a sharp polariza- tion of lack of interest on the part of the scientific community. One reason for this problem is the paucity of hard data which falls within the domain of the current scientific para- digm. The UFO evidence is character- ized by vast extremes in quality of evidence. Within this paper is em- bodied a call for reappraisal, con- solidation, and documentation. Through this study of the Australian accounts of physical traces and evi- dence for UFOs, it has become abun- dantly clear that a fresh approach is sorely needed. We have an accumu- lation of evidence ostensibly related to accounts which describe UFOs interacting with the environment and producing tangible evidence of their presence. One would expect to be able to take this extant evidence and gain a clear, unambiguous picture of the nature of the phenomenon. Unfortunately, this has not been the case. Accounts describing an extra- ordinary range of detail and quite often hard evidence have often gone uninvestigated. Many accounts re- main anecdotal, while others remain 4 the stuff of uncritical media report- ing. I am calling for a concerted attempt to change this situation. We should be directing our all-too-limited resources to reports that offer a high probability of gaining access to valu- able information that is of use to science. Concentrating on this sort of data will enable us to gain a much clearer picture of what is involved. If upon detailed enquiry the \"physical attributes\" of the phenomenon are not amenable to standard scientific methodology, then the process of reappraisal, consolidation, and docu- mentation is required to determine the appropriateness of new lines of enquiry. But until we have tried the path of quality documentation and investigation of physical evidence, the controversy that surrounds the subject of UFOs will continue. Let us now consider the Austra- lian contribution to the question of physical traces of UFO activity. For many years this writer has been accumulating data related to the sub- ject, and a fascinating body of ac- counts has been drawn together. This paper is a first attempt at ration- alizing the accounts into some sort of order. Physical Traces From diverse sources, some 237 accounts of physical traces were un- covered. Six basic types of events were defined, along with necessary categories of \"Not enough Evidence\" (NEI) and \"Other.\" Type I: Physical trace with pro- bative UFO correlation (13.9%). Type II: Physical trace with pos- sible UFO correlation (19.4%). Type III: Physical trace of ap- parent/possible natural origin, pos- sible UFO correlation (1.7%). Type IV: Physical trace with pos- sible unusual phenomenological correlation (11.4%). Type V: Physical trace of probable or apparent natural origin (16.5%). Type VI: Physical trace of prob- able spurious, hoax, or doubtful origin. NEI: Physical trace with paucity of related information. Other: Physical trace which by its apparent nature prevents any confident categorization. Each type will be broken down into the features that characterize it and case details will be summarized. (The number of examples in each category will be given parenthet- ically, but in the interests of space only one or two examples from each will be given here.)

This preliminary study has high- lighted the cross-section of data that has become available to the UFO researcher in the area of possible physical evidence for UFOs. We have a body of accounts, albeit small, that clearly refers to physical traces with strong probative UFO correlation. These documented events are com- plemented by similar accounts where- in the UFO correlations are not as strong. These combined accounts (Types I and II) give a picture of apparent interactions with the en- vironment, ostensibly produced by UFOs, that is largely consistent with the world picture that is only now being tentatively drawn. (Continued on next page) 5"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"(Australia, Continued) Type IV reports, although some- times similar to those of Type I and II, cannot be entirely reconciled with these categories. Indeed, in some accounts we seem to have phenom- ena which may fall outside the tradi- tional framework of UFO experience. It is apparent that much further work is required to reconcile these phenomena. Type V reports stand as a tribute to the infinite variety of unusual natural phenomena which lie in wait for the careless, the uncritical, or the gullible researchers. Type VI reports (hoaxes, etc.) caution us to approach remarkable events with due caution. Careful investigation and documentation techniques will aid in preventing these sorts of cases from finding currency with the community at large. Type III cases may seem a contra- diction. Natural phenomena pro- duced by UFOs? There is a small body of data both here and overseas that suggests that whatever is the stimulus for UFO reports may inter- act with the environment and pro- duce characteristics that plague us in Type V accounts. Could the UFO produce such things as \"fairy rings,\" etc? To my surprise, a few cases did surface which seem to lend support to this hypothesis. I invite construc- tive comment on this point. I close this preliminary study in the manner in which it began: with a plea for a reappraisal, consolidation, and documentation. Recently the Australian Physical Evidence Study Group (APESG) was formed to be a focal point for groups and indivi- duals interested in promoting the aims of high quality scientific docu- mentation and research of physical evidence for UFO reports. I urge you to give it your most earnest support. CIA Document AIR FORCE \"PUZZLED\" BY SOCORRO By Richard Hall A newly released CIA document published in 1966 indicates that the U.S. Air Force considered the 1964 Socorro, N.M., sighting \"the best- documented case on record\" and were \"puzzled\" by it. The otherwise unremarkable 16-page document came to light in January 1981 in- directly as a result of the GSW vs. CIA lawsuit now in Appeals Court, ask- ing for release of additional CIA documents on UFOs. A copy was released to lawyer Peter Gersten who supplied it to the Fund for UFO Research, which recently granted $2,500 toward the costs of the appeal litigation. In October 1980 private research- er W.H. Banks of Oakland, California — apparently aware of the article's existence — made a specific Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request for it and indicated that it had ap- peared in an in-house CIA publica- tion. According to the U.S. Attorneys representing the CIA, the request was specificaPy worded enough that a new search located it, inappro- priately listed under \"Intelligence- Espionage.\" Although the CIA pub- lication itself, Studies in Intelligence, is classified SECRET, the U.S. Attor- neys said, articles in it may carry various classifications or be unclas- sified. (How anyone would know they existed is another question.) After clearing it with the Air Force, the CIA released the document to Banks, GSW, and Gersten, now rep- resenting Citizens Against UFO Se- crecy in the appeal. Apparently concerned that the belated release might affect the out- come of the appeal, the U.S. Attor- neys filed a Supplemental Brief in the Court of Appeals and notified Gersten, explaining the circumstances of its finding in detail. \"The docu- ment recently discovered by CIA in no way impunes (sic) the integrity of that (prior court-ordered) search. Nevertheless/we file tHis recently uncovered document with the Court in the interest of complete and full disclosure,\" the brief said. The brief explains that the document was not indexed \"on either of the two auto- mated index systems which existed in the CIA's Office of Central Refer- ence at the time of the FOIA search in this case.\" The article in question was au- thored by Major Hector Quintanilla, Jr., then Chief of the Air Force Pro- ject Blue Book UFO investigation. For the most part, it is a highly condensed history of UFOs from the Air Force perspective sounding like a rehash of the notorious \"fact sheets\" of the 1960's. About the last % is a reasonably straightforward account of the April 24, 1964, landing case (except that it omits mention of the two humanoid figures near the \"craft\"). \"Diagnosis: Unsolved\" Under the sub-heading \"Diag- nosis: Unsolved,\" Quintanilla says: There is no doubt that Lonnie Zamora saw an object which left quite an im- pression on him. There is also no ques- tion about Zamora's reliability. He is a serious police officer, a pillar of his church, a man well versed in recog- nizing airborne vehicles in his area. (He) is puzzled by what he saw, and frankly, so are we. This is the best- documented case on record, and still we have been unable, in spite of thorough investigation, to find the vehicle or other stimulus that scared Zamora to the point of panic. Quintanilla goes on to describe the extensive check that was made in trying to explain the object as a conventional or experimental craft (confirmed by the present author 6"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"(Socorro, Continued) A KLASSICAL ENCOUNTER who has seen the complete Air Force file on the case). He refers to analysis of soil samples by the Air Force Materials Laboratory, a fragmentary report of which is in the Air Force files. However, he also states: \"Labo- ratory analysis of the burned brush showed no chemicals that could have been propellant residue.\" No such analysis report is in the case file. Earlier, in describing facilities used by the Air Force for analysis of \"physical specimens,\" Quintanilla mentions Battelle Memorial Institute, Libby Owens, Corning Glass, among others. Where are the reports of such physical analyses? Certainly they are not common public know- ledge. Which organization analyzed the Socorro brush samples and where is the scientific report? A partial answer may be suggested by a letter to me from Dr. James E. McDonald dated September 5,1968, from which I quote in part: ...a woman who is now a radiological chemist with the Public Health Service in Las Vegas was involved in some special analyses of materials collected at the Socorro site, and when she was there, the morning after, she claims that there was a patch of melted and resolid- ified sand right under the landing area. 1 have talked with her both by telephone and in person here in Tucson recently, and am asking (her) to do some further checking...She did analyses on the plant- fluids exuded from stems of grease- wood and mesquite that had been scorched. She said there were a few organic materials they couldn't identify, but most of the stuff that had'come out through the cracks and blisters in the stems were just saps from the phloem and xylem. Shortly after she finished the work, Air Force personnel came and took all her notes and materials and told her she wasn't to talk about it any more. Dr. McDonald was a highly re- garded atmospheric physicist at the Institute of Atmospheric Physics, University of Arizona. Quintanilla's article, written as it was for a SECRET CIA publication, is surprisingly uninformative and undoubtedly is an accurate reflec- tion of his own negatively biased, low-key investigation. In that same year — 1966 — Quintanilla came By Quentin Fogarty (© by Quentin Fogarty) Introduction Early on the morning of December 31, 1978, an Argosy freight aircraft, carrying a television film crew, en- countered a number of unidentified flying objects off the east coast of New Zealand's South Island. The film crew — cameraman David Crockett; his sound-recordist wife Ngaire, and this reporter — cap- tured several of the bright objects on film. This film became the basis for an investigation by an American optical physicist, Dr. Bruce Maccabee, on behalf of the National Investiga- tions Committee on Aerial Phenom- ena (NICAP). The organization, which has been conservative about such matters in the past, was prepared to endorse this film as showing a genuine unidentified flying object. By March 1979, twenty distin- guished scientists and experts in the fields of radar, optics, and physics who had seen the film were unable to explain the sighting in conventional terms. Among the distinguished group was Professor J. Allen Hynek, founder of the Center for UFO Studies (CUFOS). He declared: \"The New Zealand evidence clearly suggests some phenomenon that cannot be confirmed in ordinary terms.\" In July last year, I visited the United States and spent some time at the home of Dr. Maccabee in Silver Spring, Maryland. While he was there he agreed to meet two super skeptics of UFOs, Philip J. Klass, and Robert Sheaffer. The follow- ing is my perception of that meeting. The Encounter There they sat, the master and the apprentice; the super skeptics, the debunkers of the \"new nonsense.\" On my right, Philip J. Klass — author, writer, confessed skeptic, and elder statesman of all things rational. On my left, Robert Sheaffer — science writer, lecturer, skeptical UFO investigator — angling for the master's crown, attentive, watching, and listen- ing. On the other side of the room, myself — hopeful of a fruitful dis- cussion — and Dr. Bruce Maccabee, expecting fireworks. He wasn't to be disappointed! I had agreed to the meeting, keen for an intelligent and reasoned approach from the other side. What I didn't know was that to a super skeptic there is no such thing as an (continued on next page) under heavy fire from the news media and Members of Congress for insisting that police UFO witnesses were fooled by a satellite and the planet Venus. They had first seen a structured, large-diameter object il- luminating the road at close range that then flew off into the distance and was seen hovering as a point source of light — in addition to the planet Venus which also was visible. The state of communications be- tween the Air Force and the CIA on UFO information in the 1960's is unknown. If Quintanilla was the primary source of Air Force informa- tion, then it is quite possible that the CIA was misled as far as USAF- originated UFO information. Quint- anilla's confession in a CIA publica- tion that Socorro is unexplained and \"puzzling\" must be understood as emanating from a rather complete skeptic whose approach was to pin an explanatory label on each and every UFO sighting that would ac- count for it in conventional terms. The newly released CIA document mainly suggests that his \"faith\" was somewhat shaken by the Socorro report."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"i (Klassical, Continued) intelligent and reasoned approach. There is only scorn, innuendo, sar- casm, and character assassination. The tape-recorders rolled, and the meeting began. It became obvious fairly quickly that Mass, in particular, wasn't really interested in my side of the story. All he wanted was confirmation of his own interpretation of the events. So, when I told him something that didn't fit in with his preconceived notion, it was time for \"really Mr. Fogarty,\" and \"come on Mr. Fogarty,\" etc. The following gives some indica- tion of Klass' attitude throughout our meeting. I believe the transcript is accurate, but there were times when the raised voices on both sides of the room tended to drown out what was being said. (Key: Philip Mass, PK; Quentin Fogarty, QF). PK: My current theory, as I explained to Bruce (Maccabee) is that what you saw was Santa Claus and his reindeer... QF: ...but that is so stupid, such a stupid thing to say... PK: ...I've asked you for your hypotheses, you have refused or declined as if extraterres- trial craft is a dirty, vulgar word... QF: Not at all. What I'm saying is that you seem to be locked into the extraterrestrial theory thing. It does not have to be... PK: ...well, can you give me three other hypotheses to consider and I will entertain them I assure you. Give me three! QF: As I said, I do not know what it was... PK: ...no, give me three hypotheses... QF: ...alright, maybe it was Santa Claus and his reindeer, maybe it was, umm... PK: ...a ghost? QF: Yeah, that is one more you have given me. You are better at coming up with idiotic statements, so you make another suggestion... PK: ...then you give me your three most likely hypotheses. QF: The most likely hypothesis is that it was a bright light, secondly that it is an unexplained bright light, and on the basis of what Dr. Maccabee has found, it remains unexplained and cannot be explained in con- ventional terms. That does not mean it is Santa Claus and his sleigh, it does not mean it is a ghost, it does not mean it is a leprechaun (an earlier Klass suggestion), it does not mean it is an extraterrestrial spacecraft... And on, and on, it went. There was one question I had to ask Klass in view of his comment to me in a letter that he was not im- 8 pressed by the New Zealand case. I knew that he had been correspond- ing with Maccabee for several months and the sheer volume of this corres- pondence suggested that he had a great interest in this \"non-impres- sive\" case. Why? \"Because it has assumed such great importance in Bruce Maccabee's mind, in Hynek's (mind), and the UFO movement here,\" he replied. \"As I said, if I was asked to select an impressive UFO case this would not be one that I would select. But Bruce and the others have selected it and, like Mt. Everest, it is there...so, per- force, I must spend time on it. Let me assure you that I would rather be out on my sailboat.\" A little later in the evening, Klass again mentioned this desire to be elsewhere, rather than \"wasting his time\" on the New Zealand case. We were discussing Maccabee's involve- ment and Klass mentioned that Channel O should have hired a \"real\" investigator (a skeptic like himself), rather than a UFO-propo- nent (like Maccabee). I pointed out that on the basis of his reasoning (i.e., that a pro-UFO investigator must come up with a pro-UFO re- port), then an anti-UFO investigator must come up with an anti-UFO report. He thought about that for a moment and replied that he had really meant that the channel should have hired both a skeptic and a proponent. He then stated that soon after the sightings he had been ap- proached by the American Broad- casting Company to go to New Zealand to investigate the sightings for them. Naturally Maccabee and I were keen to know why he had not taken up ABC's kind offer. He told us he had made plans to go skiing and he didn't think the case was important enough to interupt his vacation. How Klass must rue the day he decided to go skiing instead of de- bunking. I'm sure that if he had gone to New Zealand he would have found a plausible and conventional (to him) explanation for the sightings. But he didn't go and now, unable to refute the facts, he has been forced on to his present course of ridicule and character assassination. It's the character assassination that I find particularly offensive. In a letter to me, Klass accused Bill Startup (the pilot) of having suicidal tendencies and Geoff Causer (the radar operator) of being derelict in his responsibilities. He also suggested they were \"playing games\" for the benefit of the others onboard the aircraft. In other words, he was saying that Startup and the co-pilot, Bob Guard, were setting us up — creating a UFO incident for the benefit of television news crew. What a load of drivel! Obviously Klass works to the theory that if you throw enough dirt around, some will stick. In letters to Maccabee, Klass has described Guard as \"sleepy\" and me as \"stupid.\" So we have \"Suicidal Startup,\" \"Irresponsible Causer,\" \"Sleepy Guard,\" and \"Stupid Fogarty.\" Klass was to repeat some of these unfounded, clutching-at- straws accusations at Maccabee's home that evening. In fact, he some- times got so lost along his rocky road of conspiracy and fantasy that Sheaffer had to lead him back to reality. As the evening progressed I be- came heartily sick of Klass' holier- than-thou attitude, and just after midnight I reached boiling point. Sheaffer, who had kept a relatively low profile throughout the meeting, was trying to edge Klass towards the door. I couldn't let the opportunity pass. I had suffered a lot at the hands of the so-called experts with their instant pronouncements, and I had no intention of letting Klass slip through my fingers unscathed. I be- rated him for his public statements in the first few days after the sight- ings, when he was quoted as saying the film may have shown Venus or could have been a hoax, and for his subsequent crude attempts to be- little the credibility of the witnesses. I pointed out, in language that can't be repeated here, that he and others had caused the witnesses and their families great distress with their un- founded comments.

I had hoped for a reasoned and intelligent discussion. Instead, I was treated like a child who had been caught trying to steal the cookies from Klass' cookie jar. On reflection I can now see that Klass and his ilk have no choice but to retain their anti-UFO stand. It is their raison d'etre. Although they argue that the phenomenon is not worthy of study, they spend inordinate amounts of time trying to explain it away in prosaic terms. Their crusade has also given them a degree of notoriety, it has made them public figures. If they were to accept the reality of the phenomenon they would quickly slip into obscurity. Public exposure is a drug. Klass and his fellow crusa- ders, like all publicity junkies, need their regular dose. The fact that they must publicly vilify innocent people (i.e., UFO witnesses) in order to keep themselves in the spotlight does not concern them one iota.

Introduction On May 11,1974, Mrs. Ann L Sohn, a suburban Chicago housewife and former nurse, wrote to Dr. J. Allen Hynek, Director of the newly organ- ized Center for UFO Studies, in Evanston, Illinois. In her letter, she described a close observation of a UFO as it hovered over a lot adjacent to her home in Prospect Heights, Illinois, some 20 years earlier. Through several windows around the circum- ference of the object she could see three human-like figures operating what appeared to have been \"con- trols.\" She watched for about 5 min- utes, until the object abruptly and silently departed toward the north. When her husband, who worked nights at the Chicago Tribune, came home the following morning, Mrs. Sohn told him about her sighting. \"He immediately called my atten- tion to a front-page article,\" she wrote Dr. Hynek, \"where two dif- ferent families in Round Lake, Illi- nois, had sighted the same about 11 p.m.\" Round Lake is 19 miles north northwest of Prospect Heights — the direction in which the object had vanished. No f ollowup of Mrs. Sohn's UFO sighting was undertaken at the time but one year later, in early May, 1975, the Center sent me a copy of her letter. I wrote to her on May 12th, to inquire further about her observation, and received her reply by return mail, in which she ex- pressed her willingness to cooperate in any way she could. An exchange of letters followed over the course of the next two months and a first-hand investigation was arranged through the Center with the witness, while she was in the Chicago area for the summer. We are indebted to Cap- tain Robert Runser, of the Center for UFO Studies, who conducted his inquiries over a period of weeks during the summer of 1975, the results of which form the basis for this report. Mrs. Sohn wrote to Dr. Hynek that her sighting had occurred in the late spring of 1955, but after check- ing with her former neighbors in Prospect Heights, she determined that the ground in the vacant lot over which the object had hovered was broken for the building of a new house in October of 1953; she there- fore concluded that the most prob- able date for her sighting was May 1952. A search of microfilm copies of the Chicago Tribune was made in an effort to locate the newspaper article that reported the Round Lake sight- ing, but that search was confined to 1955; no search was made for 1952, for in a letter to me dated June 23, 1975, Mrs. Sohn wrote the follow- ing: You mentioned your having some one check the Chicago Tribune of that time in your library. I hardly believe you'll find it there, as my husband worked in the Press Room at the Tribune and he always brought home the Final 5-Star (Edition), of which only a min- imum were printed, to be released in Chicago Loop. None of these Finals went anywhere, to my knowledge, except the Loop. The paper was the same except for last minute news, and went to press about 5 a.m. (Continued on next page) 9"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"(Occupants, Continued) It was Mrs. Sohn's belief that the copies of the Tribune that were on microfilm in the library were not likely to be the Final 5-Star edition that had carried the news of the Round Lake sighting on its front page. Nonetheless, the Round Lake newspaper story apparently made its way into one of the early paper- back books on \"flying saucers,\" for in her letter to me of May 23rd, she wrote the following: My brother showed me a book he had pur- chased, sometime within the-year (of the sighting), where it mentioned the UFO sight- ing in Round Lake, and the date. I will press him further'(to see) if by chance he still has the UFO books he was buying at the time. Although I believe I've asked him before, and he said no. But it may have been more of a case of \"brush off\" at the time. If I do get any of his books, I will read and see if I can find the article and will forward the information to you. A search of all available early books on \"flying saucers,\" from Scully through Keyhoe to Gerald Heard, has failed to uncover Mrs. Sohn's elusive reference to the sighting at Round Lake, Illinois. If any reader of this report can throw some light on the matter, that would be most use- ful, as a record of the Round Lake sighting would properly date and corroborate Mrs. Sohn's own UFO report. Her 1952 sighting, published here for the first time, has been prepared from Captain Runser's pre- liminary report of his extensive in- vestigation of 1975. The Sighting On an undetermined date in May 1952, Mrs. Ann Sohn put on a pot of coffee and looked at the clock. It was 10:50 p.m. She walked into the rear bedroom of her one-story ranch- style home to look in on her chil- dren, David and Lois, to see if they were covered and to check the win- dows. It was a pleasant evening and the air felt so refreshing that she sat on the foot of her son's bed to gaze out of the window at the stars. The sky was very clear. After about a minute, Mrs. Sohn's attention was drawn by a bright light toward the right, and she was amazed to see a brightly-glowing, round ob- 10 ject hovering over the vacant lot next door. The bedroom window faced the north and the lot was to the east of her home. There was a screen on the window and Mrs. Sohn pressed her face against it to more closely observe the object, most of which she was able to see except for the extreme right portion, which was obscured by the corner of her house. The object, about 30 to 40 feet in diameter, was self-luminous and hovered absolutely motionless about 100 feet (or \"two telephone poles\") above the lot for a period of from 3 to 5 minutes. It made no sound. From beneath the object, toward the left or \"front end,\" emerged a cloud of steam or vapor that drifted slowly along the bottom toward the right, giving the UFO an appearance of sitting atop a cloud. Mrs. Sohn was unable to tell where the vapor came from, seeing neither pipes nor any other type of opening. Because the object was above the level of the window, she could determine that it was round and not cigar-shaped. Along the side of the obj ect was a row of about 15 square windows and just below the windows was a line which Mrs. Sohn described as a seam, where the top and bottom portions were connected. At the top of the object was a dome which appeared to be made of plastic or plexiglass. The entire object glowed with a bright white light except for the windows, most of which were dark, and the dome, which had a pale bluish cast similar to \"the color of the blue haze of a distant land- scape.\" Mrs. Sohn's impression was that the dome was illuminated by the reflected light of the rest of the UFO. Two faint vertical objects, like poles, were visible inside the dome. (See cover for artist's rendition by Ted Jacobs.) Not all of the visible windows were dark: at the far right, or \"rear end,\" were three windows lit from within by an intense white light. The remainder of the windows were dark, except for some dim blue reflection from the glow of the UFO. Inside of each of the three illuminated win- dows Mrs. Sohn saw a \"crewman.\" In the window at the left, as well as the central window, the occupants seemed to be looking out of the windows, in the direction of the witness; the third figure, in the win- dow to the right, was seen in profile and stood motionless, appearing to study a panel of dials or instruments on the wall before him; he remained motionless for the duration of the sighting. Mrs. Sohn tried to awaken her son by nudging him but he remained fast asleep. Her father was asleep in another part of the house but she was unwilling to yell out to him and reluctant to leave the window for fear that when they returned, the object would have departed. Her husband was, of course, at work. As Mrs. Sohn wondered what to do, the figure in the window at the left made a sharp motion with his right hand, as if he were pushing forward some type of lever; as he did this, the vapor underneath the UFO increased. Almost at the same mo- ment, he pulled backward on an- other lever with his left hand, and the color of the vapor changed from white to green, with flecks of orange, then to orange with a few remaining streaks of green. Immediately follow- ing this, the figure in the central window pushed a lever forward with his right hand and the entire ship, except for the darkened windows and the dome, turned a brilliant reddish-orange color, and departed in a shallow climb to the north at an \"intense speed,\" with no apparent acceleration. It shot away at such a phenomenal velocity, Mrs. Sohn said, that it was out of sight within a second or two. It made no sound, left behind no vapor, and emitted no vapor trail in its wake. The three occupants were dressed similarly, wearing what Mrs. Sohn described as a kind of jumpsuit or coverall with hoods or headpieces, showing only the face, and appear- ing to be part of the suit. She therefore saw no hair nor ears on the men. The white light from the interior was so intensely bright that it was difficult for her to make out features on the men's faces; nor could she see the (Continued on page 12)"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"CHICAGO AND VICINITY 0 I I I 4 1 » I I Ono Inch euuflli approximately C.9 mllil ©HAND MtHALLV t» CO.

She saw no other occupants inside the object and the only other thing she could see inside besides the figures was the panel of instruments in front of the figure at the right. He appeared to be further back from the window than the other two and never moved an inch. Because the object departed towards the north, Mrs. Sohn assumed Jhe.north end was the \"front,\" and she was puzzled why the three \"crewmen\" were in the rearmost portion of the UFO. Aftereffects There were several aftereffects that were noticed following Mrs. Sohn's experience but she did not immediately connect them to the appearance of the UFO. Their cause may or may not have been due to the close proximity of the object. 1. During the previous summer (1951), the owner of the lot planted garlic on the property. During the following spring, much garlic had grown up among the usual weeds in the lot. Mrs. Sohn had, in fact, just picked some garlic prior to her UFO sighting. Very shortly after her ex- perience she sent her son next door to get another garlic bulb, and he was unable to locate any. Mrs. Sohn examined the lot herself and was amazed to discover that all of the garlic was gone; in addition, the weeds had dried up and were lying on the ground in the area over which the UFO had hovered. The circle of dead weeds was about 25 feet in diameter; weeds at the front and rear ends of the lot were normal. 2. Shortly after her sighting, all ten of Mrs. Sohn's rose bushes on the east side of her house, adjacent to the vacant lot, had died. They were all coming along nicely, with the rest of the spring growth; Mrs. Sohn prided herself on the care of her roses and she could not account for their loss. 3. On the day following her UFO sighting, Mrs. Sohn noticed that the painted trimming on the east side of 12 her house was blistered, although the trim on the rest of the house appeared to be unaffected. The main siding on the house was aluminum and was not affected. 4. During the previous year, Mrs. Sohn's neighbors on the east side of the vacant lot had planted a row of evergreen trees along the property line adjacent to the lot; all of these trees died following Mrs. Sohn's sighting. While she did not associate any of the effects with her UFO sighting at the time, Mrs. Sohn began to wonder about them as time wore on. During her observation, she had not been aware of any heat or other similar effects, nor did she see any- one descend to the ground — al- though this could have happened in the area immediately east of her house, which was not visible from her position at the window in the rear of her home. The area of the sighting is resi- dential, characterized by one-story, ranch-style homes which are set back about 50 feet from the street. The lots are about 122 feet wide by 186 feet deep, and the land is level. Palwaukee Airport, a small private field, is about 4 miles northeast of Mrs. Sohn's former home. At the time of her sighting, a NIKE base was located a few miles west of Prospect Heights. The Great Lakes Naval Air Station is situated 6 miles to the east, and Chicago's O'Hare Field is 8 miles south-southwest. Mrs. Sohn, a widow at the time of the 1975 investigation, spent win- ters in Florida with her son's family and summers in the Chicago area with her daughter and her family. In responding to my initial inquiries, Mrs. Sohn was always helpful and cooperative. During Captain Runser's on-site investigations, she was no less willing to provide all the assist- ance she could. The experience which she has so carefully described must be added to the growing list of unexplained UFO events witnessed at close range.. In his preliminary report, Cap- tain Runser describes Mrs. Sohn as follows: \"She is an intelligent, edu- cated woman, and was trained as a registered nurse. She likes to read but never read much about UFO's, with the exception of a book by Major Donald E. Keyhoe and one by George Adamski. Mrs. Sohn's mem- ory and powers of observation are excellent and she was very coopera- tive in answering all questions.\" Two Similar Contemporary Events Several month later, in August 1952, at least two other events took place, each having certain aspects of remarkable similarity tq^Mrs. Sohn's close encounter. The summer of 1952 was, of course, a major wave period. • At Seat Pleasant, Maryland, a Washington, D.C. suburb, about 9:30 p.m., Mrs. Suzanne E. Knight, then about 19, heard a buzzing sound outdoors. Looking out her kitchen window, she saw an object hovering above the street light across the street; it was shaped like an airplane fuselage, dull silver in color, with thin white smoke coming out the rear end. On a small mast at the front was a small red light. Through a row of large square windows, brilliantly lighted, she could see something like a row of cabinets with slanted tops and, to her left, in \"the front,\" a helmeted man looking straight ahead. He never moved a muscle all the while he was in view. No controls or instruments 'were visible, and he was seen only from the upper chest and shoulders. Beneath the fuselage was a kind of gondola with more windows, showing what appeared to be rows of little seats. Mrs. Knight tried in vain to call the newspaper; when she got back to the window, the \"man\" was gone and the gondola had dis- appeared. Then the interior lights went out and the object began to glow red, as if red-hot, and to rock from side to side. She left the window again, this time to call her relatives, but the object had departed when she got back. 1 • On August 25, at 5:30 a.m., William Squyres was driving to work at a radio station in Pittsburg, Kansas, when he saw an object hovering 10 feet over a field off the road to his right. He stopped his car and got out. The UFO was hovering with a slight"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"'' By Ann Druffel An Open Letter to Dr. Carl Sagan Several months ago, a small group of Los Angeles researchers were visited by a production assistant for \"Cosmos,\" a new TV series featuring Dr. Carl Sagan. \"Cosmos\" was at that time in the throes of production. Our members, being from different scientific fields and professions, were delighted to learn that Sagan had been given this chance to use his talents in a program which would make science palatable and under- standable to a fascinated, far-ranging public. One thing worried us, however. (Occupants, Continued) rocking motion and was silver-grey in color, about 75 feet long, similar in appearance to two deep platters placed rim-to-rim. There were several large square windows in the mid-section, through which movement could be seen against a blue light; through another square window at the front (to his left), Squyres could see the head and shoulders of a man, staring motion- less straight ahead. The object then departed abruptly, disappearing in a vertical ascent in a matter of seconds. It made a sound like \"a covey of quail,\" and left a backwash of wind that depressed the grass in the area over which the object had hovered. The Air Force lists the Squyres' case as \"unexplained.\" 2 NOTES 1. NICAP case file, investigated in 1968 by Ron Andrukitis, of the Washington, D.C. NICAP Subcommittee, and .published in NICAP's UFO's: A New Look (1969), pp. 26-27. 2. Project Bluebook case file (in HSG files), investigated by OSI Special Agent G.E. Swine- hart, 5th Office District, USAF. This case has been published in numerous books, most recently and completely in Dr. ]: Allen Hynek's The Hynek UFO Report (Dell, 1977), pp. 200- 203. We were all aware of Carl Sagan's penchant for acting the role of \"UFO expert\" and, in that role, negating and clouding the UFO issue. We rejoiced with the young gentleman's good fortune at being associated with \"Cosmos.\" However, we also took the time to ask him if Sagan (and/or his producers) were think- ing of including a segment on UFOs in their \"Cosmos\" plans. Rather reluctantly, he said that Carl had plans on that order but that he was not aware of the details of those plans. Further discussion re- vealed that he did not know of Sagan's sardonic attitude toward the UFO subject. He seemed surprised that any group having members whose interests ranged from acoustical re- search to immunology of cancer would regard Carl Sagan as defi- cient in any aspect of science. It took us a few minutes to explain why we regarded Carl Sagan as a rather violent foe of UFO research, who had not even accepted the fact that reputable scientists were entering the field in large numbers. Our dis- cussion ended with the following warning to Sagan's young assistant. \"Tell Carl Sagan that if he tries his 'expert act' regarding UFOs on \"Cos- mos\" and does as bad a job as he has done heretofore on the subject, that he's going to get a lot of static!\" \"Cosmos\" began its series a while ago, and people were enthralled by its superior production -qualities — exquisite scripts, inspired photo- graphy, thorough research, delight- ful topics, flashes of gentle humor, and its personable host performing in his best Saganish manner. \"Cosmos\" was a gem to be anticipated and appreciated: Until Sunday, December 14,1980. Grab your earmuffs, Dr. Sagan. The static begins. Sagan began the December 14th program with his best mellow voice and perky manner, discussing the possibility of extraterrestrial life, of which he has always been a propo- nent. Suddenly, he launched into the subject of UFOs, warning his viewers that they must regard UFO claims with rigorous and skeptical scrutiny, keeping in mind that what is important is not what the witnesses claim, but rather what can be sup- ported by hard evidence. Extraor- dinary claims, he cautioned, require extraordinary evidence. Sagan might have borrowed these statements from those who, for the past 33 years, have been batting their heads against stone walls, sift- ing through the maze of UFOs, con- fused statements, and incomplete documentation in order to glean the few cases that do present extraor- dinary evidence that something ex- traordinary is going on — that UFOs, whatever they are, do exist. So far, so good. Sagan had not said anything unacceptable as yet; but in the very next sentence he reverted to unreasoned skepticism. As a spotted leopard, Carl still had the markings of his breed. Acting the role of \"UFO expert\" to the fullest, he stated flatly that he thought the UFO subject had more to do with religion arid super- stition than with science. His voice droned on, each sen- tence adding proof that Carl Sagan evidently has done no original re- search on the UFO subject and, worse still, continues to reject all the work done by his fellow scientists. Perhaps he is not even aware of the growing piles of scientific papers on the subject. 1 The sheer numbers of (Continued on next page) 13"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"(Calif. Report, Continued) errors of fact he made during the next 5 minutes made me wonder whether these errors are due to poor research by his assistants, by inac- curate writing, or by his own pre- judices. Whatever — they are errors and, as such, will be listed here: 1. ERROR: Sagan stated that in the Betty and Barney Hill case, both witnesses saw, from their car, alien creatures within a large UFO which had been following them.\" - FACT: According to an in-depth study of this case 2 , no alien creatures were seen by Betty Hill in the first, conscious part of the Hill sighting. Barney viewed the alien entities through binoculars only after he alighted from his car and approached across a field toward the huge, hovering object. 2. ERROR: Sagan indicated that the Hills consciously remembered the craft blocking the road and the creatures approaching, preventing them from driving on. FACT: After Barney viewed the creatures in the craft, he jumped frightened into the car and began driving away. A series of beeps were heard by both witnesses and an odd, tingling drowsiness came over them. rwOOSome time later, the beeping Some time later, the beeping sound was heard again, and they found themselves 35 miles south of the encounter site. They had no conscious memory of the aliens in the road. 3 3. ERROR: Sagan stated that when the craft and creatures blocked the road, the time lapse set in, prevent- ing the Hills from remembering what happened next (until the memories were recovered through hypnotic regression.) FACT: As pointed out above, the amnesia experienced by the Hills set in between the two series of beeps. 4 4. ERROR: \"Virtually all scien- tists who have studied the Hill case,\" continued Sagan, \"are skeptical of it, but 'UFO enthusiasts' regard it as a . classical example of a close encounter of the third kind.\" 14 FACT: Many scientists regard the Hill case as a good example of a close-encounter report encompassing the so-called \"abduction scenario\" within it. It is, therefore, regarded in the field as a close encounter of the fourth kind. As for his remark about \"UFO enthusiasts,\" Sagan did not define what he meant by this term, and therefore I cannot judge this particular statement with proper ob- jectivity. All I can say is to state as dispassionately as possible that UFO researchers and investigators who have studied the Hill case recognize that this is probably the first documented example of a so-called CE-IV. However, since the term \"UFO enthusiast\" has a definite sardonic and patronizing ring, let us digress a moment and attempt to discover why Sagan used it. In a way, it is similar to the term, \"UFO buff,\" which is widely used by other skep- tics such as Phil Mass and Robert Sheaffer. \"Buff,\" as defined by Web- ster, means \"a fan or enthusiast.\" Researchers are not \"fans\" of UFOs. They are, rather, investigators, hun- ters, and trackers of the elusive ob- jects. They would like nothing more than to dispose of unidentified flying objects once and for all! There is no satisfaction in the chase, only in the completion. Sagan's term \"UFO enthusiast\" seems equally inaccurate. \"Enthu- siast,\" according to Webster, is \"a person filled with enthusiasm.\" \"En- thusiasm\" means \"to be inspired,\" \"Belief in special revelations of the Holy Spirit,\" \"religious fanaticism,\" \"inspiring zeal or fervor,\" and \"passion.\" None of the above synonyms and meanings correctly describe the dispassionate objectivity displayed by the majority of UFO researchers. Many of us are pressured by curiosity to investigate a neglected but appar- ently all-pervasive phenomenon. Even those persons whose profession in- cludes religious pursuits are objec- tive in their study of UFOs. Zeal and fervor, likewise, are sadly lacking among us; we are much too tired and frustrated by repeated failures to be zealous about our work. Any fervor we might feel is quickly quenched by the loss of energy, time and personal funds which we throw year after year into a seemingly bottomless pit. The few meager tri- umphs we enjoy are attained at the expense of our health, our families' welfare, and our personal bank ac- counts. However, if Sagan equates UFO researchers and investigators with the term \"UFO enthusiast,\" it now makes sense why he regards the UFO subject as \"having to do more with religion and superstition than with science.\" In his own way he attains a weird kind of logic, on this point at least. We have digressed enough from our discussion. Back to Sagan's \"Cosmos\" errors. 5. ERROR: In discussing the \"star map\" associated with the Hill case, Sagan asked offhandedly why any- one would take it seriously? He answers his own question by stating that some of the same (undefined) \"UFO enthusiasts\" have widely pub- lished a similar map — that is, a configuration of actual stars — bear- ing a marked resemblance to Betty's map. FACT: Reputable scientists, in- cluding Dr. David Saunders and Stanton Friedman, have laboriously concluded, by more than one set of proofs, that the Hill map seems to be an adequate replication of the position of certain planet-bearing stars in our nearby area of the galaxy. 6 In that particular part of our galactic neigh- borhood, all the stars depicted in both the Hill and researchers' maps are recorded by astronomers as the type which would be logically ac- companied by planets, and that one planet for each star would logically have a proper ecological environ- ment for the emergence of intelli- gent life as we know it. 6. ERROR: Sagan, in pointing out that some stars on Betty Hill's map were not even catalogued until years after she allegedly viewed them on the alien map aboard the craft, was holding this map for visual em- phasis. However, instead of pointing to the group of three stars about which he was speaking, Sagan pointed to the two stars in the Zeta Reticuli"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"(Calif. Report, Continued) system — two close-together stars which have been long known to astronomers. The three stars he was verbally describing were on the other side of the map graphic and were totally ignored by him during this entire discussion. 7. ERROR: Sagan made reference to the \"navigation lines\" which had allegedly been seen by Betty Hill between the \"stars\" on the map aboard the UFO, and which had been replicated onto the duplicate map by Marjorie Fish, the researcher who did the original work on the Hill map. He stated, \"If some other set of lines is substituted, the eye is suddenly biased against seeing any similarity between the two maps at all.\" Suiting action to the word (this time), he showed two sample maps in which different lines had been drawn between the \"stars.\" FACT: This illogic is unworthy of a man of Carl Sagan's intellectual capacity. When trying to prove that two leopards were members of the same species, biologists of old did not try to confound their research by dying one leopard's pelt so that the spots showed pink, while the other leopard was permitted to remain his natural color. Evidently, whatever was responsible for the Hill exper- ience induced Betty to see certain lines drawn between different spots of light (stars). Researchers into the meaning of this \"map\" had to work with the sketch Betty provided them. Scientists and other researchers have no right to change essential facts, merely to prove that an observation cannot be true. 8. ERROR: Sagan stated that the stars in the Fish map were \"picked and chosen\" from a large number of available stars, hinting that this was deliberately done in order to obtain a match with the Hill map. FACT: Sagan did not mention that the stars chosen by Marjorie Fish were all the potential planet- bearing stars within a certain dis- tance of earth. The researchers who produced the \"match\" with the Hill map worked only with the facts available to them.

In the UFO field, he picks and chooses — as far as his limited knowledge of the subject will allow — only those statements, innuen- does, and incomplete facts which fit his thesis, his thesis being that \"UFOs are bunk.\" 9. ERROR: Sagan stated the Hill encounter is touted by UFO research- ers as \"the best attested case of UFO close encounters.\" FACT: Although the Hill en- counter is considered a classic case, it is only one of hundreds of such reported, documented encounters, all of which seem to present some evidence that something unexplained is happening. Although no close encounter HI or IV by itself presents proof positive, the total of all such cases, reported by reliable and sane individuals, does present overwhelm- ing evidence that the phenomenon is real. Sagan dispatched the entire UFO question within 5 minutes. Slough- ing off the subject so summarily, he gave the distinct impression that UFOs were not worthy of more than passing mention. I would hope that these few flashes of \"static\" are not the only public reaction Sagan receives. I would hope that receiv- ing static from many sources — scientists, researchers, and lay lis- teners alike — Carl Sagan will begin to take a second look at UFOs. Since he is obviously a man of intelligence and sensitivity, a logical appeal to his sense of fair play might yield positive results. NOTES 1.

He has a new book scheduled for publication this year entitled Intrusions: Society and the Paranormal. He also expressed appre- ciation for the global outlook of the Journal, something we hope to ex- pand on and has granted permission for reprinting his article on abduc- tion cases which will appear in the April issue.) Paraphysical Controversy Editor, In his report, \"The Extraterres- trial-Paraphysical Controversy: A Communication\" (No. 153, Novem- ber 1980), Mr. Budd Hopkins takes me to task for my views on the Paraphysical (vs. Extraterrestrial) nature of UFO occupants and ab- ductors. I would like to briefly respond. Are we entitled to set limits for how UFO beings behave? Mr. Hop- kins believes not and this is a per- fectly acceptable stance to take. But I think a case could be made for the opposite position. UFO occupants usually resemble us; this is especi- ally true of the beings who often engineer UFO abductions. They also have a technology which seems to be an extension of ours — that is, they apparently use metal and fly their craft in an intelligent manner. These factors might lead one to suggest that these beings should think and behave something like us as well. They should at least think ra- tionally and laterally. But they don't. Interactions with UFO occupants are 16 often absurd and metalogical. The only conclusion one can reach is the UFO occupants look humanoid but don't think humanoid. This makes no biological sense, since there is considerable evidence that thought processes are probably genetically programmed. So just how do UFO abductors behave? As I point out in my recent anthology, UFO Abductions, they communicate through absurdities, space-time incongruities, and sym- bols. This also just happens to be the way that our own dreams speak to us. This couldn't all be merely coin- cidence and indicates that \"alien\" beings are somehow linked to our minds. While investigating (with Ann Druffel) the abductions and contacts which constitute the \"Tujunga Canyon Contacts,\" I was struck by how often the reports we were gain- ing from our witnesses resembled human dreams — and usually con- tained symbolic reflections encap- sulating their own psychosexual concerns and conflicts. This hardly fits in with the idea that they were abducted by alien beings from an- other planet! I note too that Budd Hopkins totally ignores this vital piece of data — upon which the unraveling of the Tujunga Canyon Contacts rests — in his report. I certainly do not deny that there exists a technological aspect to the UFO mystery; anyone who does must be very naive indeed. But any ultimate explanation for UFOs must take into consideration the very human and psychological elements of this mystery. I would also like to comment on my concept of \"The Phenomenon\" which Mr. Hopkins blatantly mis- represents to his readers and tries to equate with Vallee's concept of a \"control system.\" Contrary to what Mr. Hopkins suggests, there is nothing metaphysical about my use of this term. I am merely postulating the existence of an X-factor in the universe — nature unknown — which produces the UFO mystery. The term \"The Phenomenon\" is totally neutral. By reinterpreting the nature of this agency, Mr- Hopkins is merely demonstrating an unfortu- nate bias. In conclusion, I have no a priori bias against the extraterrestrial hypothesis I have just found that this explanation simply doesn't fit the evidence and stories about UFOs I have either read about or investi- gated. I would also remind Mr. Hopkins, and readers of this reply, that a theory can only be considered truly scientific if it can be experi- mentally tested. Any other theory is merely a lapse into metaphysics. In my UFO Abductions, I outline how- my theories about the nature of the UFO abduction syndrome is, in fact, testable. I wonder if promoters of the extraterrestrial hypothesis would be willing to do the same? D. Scott Rogo Editor, After reading this article I must ask myself if Mr. Hopkins is the Don Rickles or Bennett Cerf of the UFO media before I can even begin un- ravelling this crazy-quilt article. How many close encounters has Hopkins had? Has he had any CE- III's? From the way Mr. Hopkins presents his view I assume he's had a \"CE-IX\" — the abduction and return of Hopkins was so entirely success- ful that he's returned as a walking- talking cryptogram, who, being so expertly enciphered, cannot locate his own key! Mr. Hopkins concludes \"...it will be easier for us to invent and polish earthly, though 'paranormal' or even quasi-religious 'explanations' for what we observe than to understand the technologies, values, and methods of another world.\" Prior to this conclusion Mr. Hopkins makes it abundantly clear that he may him- self be inhumane, untouchable, above our concepts of good and evil, and has placed himself atop the pillar in the Center of the \"Cosmic Control System,\" and qualified himself a representative of the \"clockwork- gone-awry\" mechanism itself! Timothy Lee King (Note: The letters above were sub- mitted by Associate Editor Ann Druffel, author of \"California Re-"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"(Letters, Continued) port,\" on behalf of two of her col- leagues.) Editor, Budd Hopkins' article is a breath of fresh logic and a reminder that ultimately we must understand the UFO phenomenon in terms of human intelligence, not human superstition; in terms of scientific reasoning, not magical short-cuts. We need to rethink and inter- nalize a fact which we know, at least in the periphery of our thinking: When confronted with advanced science from another culture, humankind almost invariably con- cludes that the supernatural has arrived, wielding wondrous miracles and awesome punishments. The r>araphysical conclusion presents similar faulty thinking: nuts and bolts UFOs, with extraterrestrials at the helm, are not capable of the tech- nical gymnastics reported. Para- physical proponents also apparently conclude that if an encounter in- volves telepathy, psychokinesis, or evidence of other psi abilities, it does not involve biological extraterres- trial beings. Paranormal aspects to cases can be explained in terms of beings with minds advanced beyond our minds by a few hundred or thousand years. We humans are beginning to under- stand our psychic abilities in ration- al, scientific terms and this under- standing may eventually lead to developing these abilities. There is no hocus pocus involved in this step forward for humanity, nor is there anything magical about beings who have developed these abilities al- ready. There is no guidebook which says that they cannot be from other stellar worlds simply because there might be paranormal aspects to some cases. Why must humankind immediately jump back into the old habit of assuming that advanced technology is evidence of super- natural beings? It seems very reasonable to as- sume that the beings inside UFOs will walk up and introduce them- selves on the day that humans realize that we are their equals as solid, sentient lifeforms. On that day, perhaps we will have matured enough to go out into a galaxy teem- ing with sentient life without giving in to our old disgusting habits of groveling before gods and chasing witches and demons. We are capable of intelligence! I don't pretend to have access to that handbook of Alien Visitors from a Distant Galaxy either, that would say when extraterrestrials would come on down and shake hands. To make conclusions from a non- existent handbook on Alien Nature is an error in scientific investigation. Thank you, Mr. Hopkins, for remind- ing us all of this important fact. Diane Tessman St Petersburg, Ha. Rebuttal to Sagan and Hopkins Editor, Despite those who deny the validity of UFO reports, the subject remains as mysterious and as worthy of scientific investigation today as it was 30 years ago. Nothing is known for certain. Those who push one explanation at the expense of others do so by examining bits and pieces and ignoring the overall picture. In a recent episode of \"Cosmos\" entitled \"Encyclopedia Galactica,\" Carl Sagan took a cursory look at the UFO phenomenon and determined it to be without substance. Arbitrarily choosing the abduction of Betty and Barney Hill as being one of the best cases, he then implied that their experience was either a hoax or an hallucination. From this single in- cident he concluded that UFOs are unworthy of serious attention. Dr. Sagan obviously chose this case because it may very well have been hallucinatory. Also his criticism that almost any stars may be made to conform to the map observed by Mrs. Hill is valid. (Not according to Dr. David Saunders, Walter N. Webb, Stanton Freidman and others. — Editor) However, the Hill abduction is certainly not the best nor the most typical of UFO sightings. Surely the Exeter sightings or that of Lonnie Zamora would have been fairer choices. Further, Sagan banishes UFOs from the realm of science altogether by stating they belong more to the realm of religion and superstition. We would do well to remember, however, that science is not a single entity. It is a collection of intellectual tools used by man to discover the truth about himself and his world. With these tools he can investigate any subject, even those considered religious. After all, surely no one today believes that science and reli- gion are irreconcilable opposites? We can perhaps forgive those, like Carl Sagan, who speak from incomplete knowledge. But what about those active UFO researchers who refuse to consider any theory other than their own? Budd Hop- kins in his article \"The Extraterres- trial — Paraphysical Controversy: A Communication,\" (No. 153, No- vember 1980) attacks the para- physical theory without, however, supplying any evidence for the ex- traterrestrial theory which he champions. Hopkins states that those who advocate the paraphysical theory claim that UFOs do not behave as we expect alien visitors to act. He is partially correct in retorting that we have no way of knowing how extra- terrestrials would indeed act toward us. It is not illogical, though to expect them to act rationally. UFOs, for the most part, do not display rational behavior. After having supposedly traveled untold light-years to Earth, they spend their time buzzing air- craft, performing acrobatics, and frightening our people. They act like mischievous children, spirits, or the products of the unconscious mind. The evidence for either theory is inconclusive and it's really not that important what one believes UFOs are. What is essential is that one keep an open mind and examine all the facts. That's what true science is all about. Kim L.

These men are to be commended for their brilliant fielding of questions and the scienti- fic confidence which they instilled in the audience. Larry King announced the address of MUFON on seven occasions during the 3-hour program. We have been literally flooded with favorable mail from people interested in joining the Mutual UFO Network and subscribing to the Journal. The third edition of MUFON's Field'Investigator's Manual, to be available early in 1982, will be up- dated to include state-of-the-art tech- niques such as photo analysis by computer enhancement, and hyp- notic regression as tools for UFO research. Specialized sections will be revised by the authors of the second edition published in 1975. This announcement is an invitation to members to submit material which they feel would be appropriate for inclusion in the new manual. Dr. Richard Haines and Wayne Laporte have already submitted material that will be used. Dr. Haines has special- ized in pilot UFO sightings, there- fore he plans to prepare a new sighting report form and a section in the manual devoted to this phase. All proposed papers and revi- sions should be mailed to MUFON by September 1,1981, so the editor, Raymond E. Fowler, MUFON Director of Investigations, and MUFON may edit, produce, and publish our new manual. We still have a small supply of our current manuals which are readily available at existing prices. Obviously, the new manual will cost considerably more than our present manual due to inflation during the past 5 years. The MUFON Field Investigator's Manual has been adopted as the standard in many English-speaking nations. The Cen- ter for UFO Studies has distributed our manual since its inception to CUFOS investigators. We have been advised by Dr. J. Allen Hynek, Scientific Director, and John Timmerman, Chairman of the CUFOS Board of Directors, con- cerning major changes in the organ- ization of the Center for UFO Studies necessitated by financial considera- tions. One of the most notable cost reductions involved the closing of their offices at 1609 Sherman Ave., Suite 207, Evanston, IL 60201 and transferring the administrative offices to the residence of Dr. and Mrs. J. Allen Hynek in Evanston, Illinois. The mailing address of CUFOS is P.O. Box 1402, Evanston, IL 60204. Allan Hendry, CUFOS Chief Investi- gator now living in Stone Mountain, Georgia, will be removed from the payroll of CUFOS effective March 1, 1981, as well as the office secretary, Estelle Postol. Basically, Dr. Hynek will head up the scientific and inves- tigative activities, whereas Mr. Timmerman will manage the busi- ness aspects. Ms. Paula Harris in Boulder, Colorado, plans to coor- dinate the CUFOS investigators under the direction of Dr. Hynek. Mrs. Mimi Hynek will edit the annual JOURNAL OF UFO STUDIES instead of Dr. Elaine Hendry. Further details of the reorganization will be pub- lished by the Center for UFO Studies, Associate Newsletter and IUFOR in the magazine \"Frontiers of Science.\" All mail destined for John Timmer- man should be sent to CUFOS, P.O. Box 1621, Lima, Ohio 45802. Having operated MUFON since 1969, your Director is very cogni- zant of the financial limitations of a not-for-profit corporation in the field of UFOlogy. Since MUFON's incep- tion, the administrative offices have been provided rent-free to the or- ganization, by the Director which included the heat, air conditioning, and lights. Our payroll consists of two people, an office manager/sec- retary and a part-time clerk. Every- one else in MUFON is a volunteer. The organization could not exist without the fantastic fine work of these volunteers throughout the world, who treat their personal ex- penditures as an avocation. We could not afford the luxury of a suite of offices and remain viable from a financial position. We are indebted to the wonderful people in MUFON, who have made the organization what it is today. Financial problems have been obstacles to all UFO organizations throughout the years. NICAP, once the largest and most active, suc- cumbed due to finances, poor manage- ment, and external pressures. Jim and Coral Lorenzen, at AFRO, recog- nized these problems many years ago and took preventive steps to keep their overhead costs from be- coming excessive. CUFOS is now rectifying their financial position so that they may continue to be a viable organization. When CUFOS was organized and first announced in 1973 on the Dick Cavett TV show, MUFON was and still is the only major UFO group to volunteer bur cooperative support to the Center for UFO Studies. Dr. Hynek and John Timmerman fully recognize this fact and are endeavoring to remove the stigma that gives one the impression of \"a one-way street,\" whenever material is submitted to CUFOS. A reduction in personnel in the CUFOS office obviously will not resolve this problem. UFO enthu- siasts around the world write to MUFON with personal requests for information that a staff of a dozen could not fulfil. We are thus sym- pathetic to the problems faced by CUFOS. In behalf of MUFON, CUFOS, and I am sure APRO as well, we appeal to all of our mem- bers and subscribers to recognize our limitations for services. It is interesting to note that the most demanding people are non-members who want to write books, articles, research projects, and produce motion pictures, television or radio pro- grams. Some readers have noted that the APRO Bulletin has not been current for many months. Due to Mr. Lorenzen's full time job and the poor health of Mrs. Lorenzen, neither has been able to devote the time required to publish the bulletin or perform the numerous functions of (Continued on next page) 18"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"Lucius Parish in Other's words An article in the January 27 issue of NATIONAL ENQUIRER quotes various UFO investigators on the possibility that some UFOs are ac- tually living creatures of pure energy which have been dubbed \"zeroids.\" The February 3 issue of the ENQUIRER features Bob Pratt's re- port on November 1980 sightings of UFOs in northern Missouri and Kansas.

Allen Benz, AFRO staff librarian, is currently soliciting the help of influential people in UFOlogy, who are members of MUFON, CUFOS, and formerly NICAP,\"to assist APRO in leader- ship roles. This may be a difficult task for Mr. Benz, because some of these people have been subjected to some very unfortunate and degrad- ing experiences when they were members of APRO many years ago. Jim and Coral have contributed immensely to the field of UFOlogy, especially in the 1950s and 1960s with their books, that helped to keep interest alive. 1981 may be the year when the Board of Directors of APRO recognize the advantages of coop- erating with CUFOS and MUFON, so as to present a united front to not only the worldwide scientific com- munity, and UFO researchers every- where, but also to the few vocal debunkers who obtain unwarranted publicity. This is a public invitation to the Board of Directors of APRO to reconsider their isolationist attitude and establish a cooperative rapport with MUFON and CUFOS in the best interest of UFOlogy. D The 1981 UFO ANNUAL, from the publishers of UFO REPORT, is made up almost entirely of articles reprinted from past issues of the magazine. Nothing new, if you're a regular reader of UFO REPORT. What was originally called TRUE FLYING SAUCERS & UFOs, which then became TRUE UFOs & OUTER SPACE, is now TRUE OUTER SPACE & PARANORMAL WORLD. What- ever they call it, the #21 issue has very little of interest in it. One pos- sible exception is an \"encore\" article by the late Edward Ruppelt, ori- ginally published in TRUE over 20 years ago. The March issue of FATE has Part 1 of George Barley's article, \"Crashed Saucers and Pickled Aliens.\" Earley casts a skeptical eye at the reports of crashed alien ships being transported from the southwestern states to Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio. He contends that it would have been virtually impos- sible to accomplish such a task by air, rail, or highway in the late 1940's or early 1950's, when some of the re- trievals allegedly occurred. Part 2 of the article will appear in the April issue of the magazine. An article dealing with the \"new wave\" of UFO theories is featured in the March issue of AMAZING. It contains a few errors, along with quotes from some UFO theorists whose ideas are questionable, at best. A brief look at recent and forth- coming books of possible interest: T.B. Pawlicki's HOW TO BUILD A FLYING SAUCER has been published in a \"Reward\" paperback edition ($6.95) by Prentice-Hall. Erich von Daniken's latest work, SIGNS OF THE GODS, and Margaret Sachs' THE UFO ENCYCLOPEDIA have recently been released by G.P. Put- nam's Sons. THE UFO CATALOG by Milt Machlin is out from Quick Fox Publishers in a paperback edi- tion. Zecharia Sitchin, author of THE 12TH PLANET, has a new book out from St. Martin's Press, THE STAIR- WAY TO HEAVEN. Ronald D. Story's UFOs AND THE LIMITS OF SCIENCE is scheduled for March release from William Morrow. Also coming out in March from Macmillan is Greta Woodrew's ON A SLIDE OF LIGHT, dealing with alleged communications from extraterres- trials. What promises to be an ex- ceptionally interesting book is Dr. Harley D. Rutledge's PROJECT IDENTIFICATION, to be published by Prentice-Hall in a \"Reward\" paper- back edition in April, with a hard- cover edition slated for July. Also set for July release is Budd Hopkins's book, INVISIBLE EPIDEMIC, dealing with UFO abductions cases. This will be published under Putnam's \"Marek\" imprint in hardcover.

Joe Santangelo, Regional Director, and MUFON of Massachu- setts will host our first symposium in the Eastern Region. Program Chair- man, Miss Joan Thompson, has an- nounced the names of the featured speakers and their subject matter. The Keynote Speaker will be Dr. J. Allen Hynek, an overview and status of the UFO phenomenon; Ted Phil- lips, UFO landing-trace cases; Ron Westrum, sociology of UFOs; Rev. Barry Downing, religion and UFOs; Dr. Bruce Maccabee or Richard Hall will make an announcement con- cerning the Fund for UFO Research; Budd Hopkins and Ms. Aphrodite Clamar, hypnosis and abductions; Peter Gersten, C.I.A./Government involvement; Lt. Col. Lawrence Coyne, the 1973 helicopter experience; and Stanton T. Friedman, crashed saucers and the Roswell Incident. Several workshops and films have been scheduled simultaneously with featured events to provide a well rounded program. Workshop speak- ers presently scheduled are Mrs. Cynthia Hind, MUFON Foreign Rep- resentative for Zimbabwe in Africa; Dr. Hauser representing MUFON- CES in West Germany; and Ray- mond E. Fowler on field investiga- tions. A flyer containing the reserva- tion details will be included with the MUFON UFO JOURNAL for the convenience of people planning to attend. The package price to attend all sessions will be $20. Through the facilities of M.I.T. they are offering a special price for meals, hospitality, and a banquet, which requires an advanced reservation. Details and the deadline for reservations will be announced in the Journal. Symposium reservations also include the Hayden Planetarium show. . The Center for UFO Studies has announced the dates for their second UFO Conference to be devoted to the scientific examination of the UFO phenomenon. It is scheduled for September 25, 26, and 27,1981, and will have a Chicago-area hotel as the headquarters. CUFOS had their first conference on the state of UFO re- search in 1976. We have been ad- vised that APRO has moved the date for their 1981 UFO Conference in Cleveland, Ohio, up to June 5,6, and 7, to be held at the Marriott Inn- Airport. By spreading the dates and the regional area for each confer- ence, we hope that each may be a successful event. By being the only major UFO organization conducting annual UFO symposiums, MUFON has established a fine tradition that others would like to emulate. Dr. Mohamad Abdo Yamani, Minister of Information for the government of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, has accepted our invitation to be our representative in this influ- ential middle east nation. Dr. Ya- mani earned his doctorate in geolo- gy from Cornell University in Ithaca, N.Y., and has authored a UFO book printed in Arabic. MUFON's Inter- national Coordinator, Michael Sin- clair, has recently met with our rep- resentatives in Switzerland and West Germany. He will share the benefi- cial results of these meetings with Journal readers in a forthcoming issue. He has made tentative plans to visit our representatives in London and Paris, to coordinate UFO research and cooperation in Europe. Stanley C. Ferguson, one of MUFON's first State Section Direct- ors, has moved from the Dallas, Texas, area to accept a very signifi- cant employment opportunity in the Odessa/Midland, Texas community. In the past few months, Stan has done a fantastic job in helping to revitalize the MUFON-Metroplex organization. We hope that this en- thusiasm will be extended into his new assignment as State Section Director for the following west Texas counties: Ector, Midland, Upton, Crane, Andrews, Winkler, Martin and Ward. Stan's new address is 2762 Brentwood, Odessa, TX 79726. Rev. G. Neal Hern, State Director for Texas, has appointed Lewis J. Willis, Jr., 3917 Roma Court, Rock- wall, TX 75087 to fill the vacancy created by Stan's reassignment. Lou will be responsible for Dallas, Rock- wall, Kaufman, Ellis, and Collin Counties. Mr. Willis is currently con- ducting a Field Investigator's train- ing course utilizing MUFON's manual for members in MUFON-Metroplex.' On February 6,1981, \"The Larry King Show\" emanating from the Mutual Broadcasting System studios in Washington, D.C., was devoted to the subject of UFOs. Carried by over 200 radio stations in the United States, it is the nation's most popular radio-talk show. After your Director initiated the contact for the show, it was placed in the very capable hands of our MUFON people in the Wash- ington, D.C., area who could partici- pate as a panel in the MBS studios with Larry King as moderator. Fred Whiting made the final arrangements. To obtain maximum benefit from this nationwide exposure, it was de- cided that Dr. Bruce Maccabee, Chair- man of the Fund for UFO Research; Richard H.
