At one point the UP0 nosed down and from the front it appear- ed oval with three large \"headlights\" at whst appemed to be the for- ward section. Smaller red and white lights, which were located three quarters of the way around the rim of the UE'O, kept blinking on and off, Apparently it disappeared from view when the boys were on Fairview Hoad about two blocks from Pr~uty~~ hone, at 10:40, and they went on to the home where Lucht phoned the Nike base to report what they had seen. He was switched to the airforce where his report was listened to. \"But I don't think they believed me,\"Lucht said, The object caxe into view again at 10~50 and Lccht and Prouty climbed on to the roof for a better view, then ducked to lie flat as the object went directly overhead. \"I think if I had stood up, I could have hit it with a rock,It Lucht said later.

Herxell, zfter seeing the flying ob jeccs the everting of June 5th, a:;& we draw upon the 5-page typed intepview for the officerts report of what he observed. Major Richmond was flying a T-33 (jet trainer) with Captain George Stevenson riding as an observer. They were criaising at 33,000 feet at 462 miles per hour inbound to Scott Air Force Base and were 138 miles west of the field when he first saw the cbject. We now quote his ex- act words, as written down by Ivk. Hertell and including the latterfs parenthetical notes: Itme time was 22527 (5:52 1M CDT). I was on Chanml 5.9 calling BLv (~coit) when I first saw the object, It was at my 1145 position (in front of him) on a heading of 280 degrees (head i,ng west). It was chronle-green, verj brilliant, like an arc light or like burning pliosphorus. I called to Stevenson and pointed to it. He saw lt too. It continued on across the sky off my left wing and. exited. about 4,000 feet above me (37,000 ft. Altitude). It was as large as our largest airliner and it hd a tail 200 feet long of what looked like white phosphorus, a burning tail. ThattS about all I can tell you. We both s2w it go across the sky--it was still daylight. I've nevcr seen anything like that in all the time I've been flying. What really got me was its Plat trajectory. It kept right on going straight west. It sure wasn't a meteor--I've scen plenty of them. They only last a couple of seconds 2nd a1x.y~ curve dovm to~~~ard the earth.\" Further ~uestions from PIr.

PIr. Hertell concludes this to be \"a valid sighting of an actml unidentified flying obj8ectm for the following rcasons: \" (1) the ex- pertise of the wltness rules out the usual natural phenordena such as weather balloons, cloud fornations, meteors, birds, windshield re- flections etc; (2) the flat trajectory, comunrnt~velv slpw spzed, long duration of observnncc, - Fa? es o~it netnot.

The very fine detail, such as the canals, may be seen for a matter of only a few seconds during sev- eral hours of observation, As a telescope magnifies the planet, it also magnifies the atmospheric turbulance. The atmosphere of M&rs is so thin that it presents hardly any problem as far as concealing details' on the surface, Mars' canals were first seen during the opposition of 1877 by Schi- aparclli. He observed the planet for a period of several years. &ria& this time he noted curious lines connecting various dark areas later called oasis. home years later Percival Lowell, an American astron- omer, founded an observatory near Flagstaff, Arizona to observe the red planet. Observers at the observatory, which was built In 1894, be - gall to record liiany new canals, some of wiiich disi3layed the phenomenon of doubling, two lines rumlilg parallel to each other.
