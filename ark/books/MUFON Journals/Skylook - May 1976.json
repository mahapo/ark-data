Short Editor-Publisher Emeritus Len String! ield Commentary Editor's Column New MUFON magazine to replace Skylook Due to personal considera- tions (we have sold our house and I will be assuming additional duties in my teaching position in the coming months; etc.), Carolyn and I will be giving up the editing and publishing of Skylook. This change will be effective with this issue if details can be worked out with MUFON—soon in any case. Under a tentative agreement worked out between the present publisher and MUFON at a meet- ing in Kansas City, the sub- scription list for Skylook will be transferred to MUFON, and MUFON will publish a monthly magazine for current and future subscribers. At this writing, the name of MUFON 1 s magazine is not known, but the format and contents 'are expected to be similar to Skylook's, with most of the same staff members and contributors. Skylook was founded in 1967, and edited and published for many years by Norma Short. In 1969 Skylook agreed to serve as MUFON's official publication. This interfacing of Skylook and MUFON has proven beneficial for both. During this time, Skylook has been financially and edi- torially independent of MUFON, although the two have cooper- ated closely. The current edi- tor and publisher took over the already successful and respec- ted magazine from Mrs. Short in January of 1974 and has attemp- ted to continue to \"tell it as it is.\" It would be impossible to name all of the persons who have done so much to make Sky- look what it is—as staff mem- bers, as contributors, and as boosters. To name one or two would be to unfairly fail to name many others equally de- serving. It has been a group effort. Thanks for your help and your support.

Bil Gil Helair Jon. 21, 1976 NOSTRADAMUS (Submitted by Richard Hall, international coordinator) At St-Jean-en-Royans, France on Jan 9, 1976, Jean Dolecki is driving his Camionette (pickup truck) on the little departmen- tal road that connects RN 531 (Grenoble-Valence) to Pont-en- Royahs. It is a few minutes after 7 p.m. Dolecki knows well this road, which gives access- to pictur- esque drives in the vicinity of Royans 5 Vercors. Not far off is the minuscule village of Echevis. Dolecki .lives in this village with his wife, an artist, and their Page 4 daughter. Of Polish origin, aged 55, he has an established business in the upkeep of cen- tral-heating installations. This Friday evening, then,. M. Dolecki is hastening home .after a tiring week. .The night is dense, very dark. Suddenly he sees, high in the sky, a very .brilliant ball. At first he merely glances -at it. But the., ball loses height, descends rapidly, and appears to come toward .him. Dolecki slows down and : gazes at this strange spectacle, • no detail of which is lost on him, for this former Baltic seaman re- tains a sharp observational ability. -•• • - - • ' Thought it would crash \"I had the impression that it was a big . globe sometime like those that one used to see in Cafes,\" he explains. \"It shone . as if it were covered with silver paper. I certainly thought it was going to crash onto my truck or right in the middle of the road. I braked, then pulled over \" to the right, fascinated by this light. I cutoff the ignition, left my lights on, and got out of the truck.\" What Dolekci then sees, in the middle of the field to the right of the road, leaves him astounded. \"The brilliant sphere was there, about 100 meters (340"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"feet) away, but new lights had appeared on it that lit it up brightly. \" It ; was <, very, large,_ at least 12-14 meters .(40-4.7;? ft) in diameter The upper part was larger than the lower. I don't believe the machine was resting directly, .on the ground, because the bottom : of it emit- , ted a bizarre light which did not diffuse around. On each side of the top, I could see- something like helices that vi- brated. Moreover, the top of the .ball also appeared to .vi- brate. -  . \"I admit that I was afraid. I retreated a few meters, with- out daring to get back into my truck. Then, in the upper part , of the . sphere, a door opened that looked to me .to be 2 meters (6^ ft) - high.. I felt more and more disquieted. Sud- denly, three forms were framed in the openingr-three forms that seemed . to be dressed in : aluminum diving suits'. ',>• \"They were not men, no!' ' I can assure you of that. Rather, they were giant robots/ of the same height' as the door, with the motions of automata, with no suppleness. They descended very rapidly from the machine. \"I saw then that they had . small legs, and for arms,, a sort of telescopic pole that made me think of a fishing rod. As to their heads,, I find it difficult to .say what they re- sembled. . .something indefin- able, of a square shape, is really all I can tell you about them.  .„.-..._,• \"The three beings'moved away from the sphere.. Not by much; only a few meters. They walked like mechanical toys, by jumps> wagging their poles—their arms, if you want to call them that—up and down. I did not move, I could hardly, breathe. I could only think that the headlights of my truck, which I had left on, would surely;at- tract .them. -But no—they didn't even seem to notice me. \".••• \"••*: .. Robots re-enter craft - \"After about 10 minutes, the robots reentered their craft. The door closed again, and the lights went out, except for the \"top* level:-of the;, sphere, 'which remained the\" same blinding 'white. Then the machine took off, disappearing at a dizzying speed. I. got back in my truck.. Once .in the cab, I made the sign of the cross. I was trem- bling so much that I couldn't get started. But there was only one thing I wanted to do, to get home. No interest in UFOs r \"A bit later, after I was on the way, I was thinking that I, who have never opened a book of science-fiction, who detest films of that kind and who have never taken any interest in flying saucers or extraterrest- rials, had just had an adven- ture which I would have gladly passed up, and which I would not wish on anybody!\" : When he finally gets back, Jean Dolecki sits down at the table, where his wife and daughter have begun to eat without waiting for him. Both can see by his manner that \"something has happened.\" He tells them all about it and, in spite of the skepticism with which they greet his tale, he takes up the phone as soon as the meal is over to inform the police at Saint-Jean-en-Royans of his adventure. The brigade commander is far less incredulous than Mme and Mile '' Dolecki. He no longer makes jokes about UFOs, after that day in 1974 when two of his men witnessed the passage of a mysterious machine over Saint-Nazaire-en-RoyansJ More- over, the commander ' has known Jean Dolecki for a long time. He is not hallucinated nor a mythomaniac. His reputation is that of a sensible man deserv- ing of credence; he would not be amusing himself by setting the police onto an affair which would incur the risk of bring- ing to justice the author of a hoax. The police chief of St-Jean- en-Royans immediately alerts the brigade of Pont-en-Royans, in whose .jurisdiction Dolecki saw the UFO land and discharge 'its three occupants. An inves- tigation is instituted. It re- veals that a few dozen meters from the field where the object landed is a farm inhabited by M. and Mme. Alphonse Carrus. On the evening -of Jan. 9 they were watching \"Numbers and Let- ters\" on the TV when suddenly, on several occasions, the image briefly disappeared from the screen.. Coincidence? Perhaps; but the time of the boradcast of this program agrees with that of M. Dolecki's observa- tion.  > On the other hand, at another farm, at the far end of the field, the farmers, who were also watching television, did not remember noticing anything unusual. Other reports In the Royans-Vercors region, on the borders of -the Grenoble region, the number of observa- tions of this sort is too large to keep\" count of. On the 5th and 6th of January, near Domene in the Isere, a sort of giant with long blond hair, dressed in a one-piece suit as bril- liant as if it reflected light, came; out of a mysterious ma- chine resting on 5 feet and .terrorized a little .boy of 10, Jean-Claude Silvente. On two occasions the \"giant\" walked toward the child, who took to his . heels and ran away as fast as he could. Jean- ' Claude was not the only one to see the . machine, which came back the next day to land in the same place. .:0n this second occasion the boy was accompan- ied by his mother, his 17-year- old sister Eliane, and a friend of the latter, Marcel. Solvini, 20. All saw a sphere like a \"big red headlight\" descend from the sky. As it seemed to want to land on top of them, the astounded witnesses fled, •and made.:haste to tell their story (just a few days earlier than Jean Dolecki*s) to the police of Domaine.

A case number consists of four two-digit groups as outlined below: 75061512 First two digits represent .the year (1975). 75061512 Second two digits indicate the month (June). 7506J.512 Third set of digits represent the day of month (15th). 75061512^ Fourth set of digits indicate the report number assigned for that particular day. The example above would indicate that case number 75061512 was the twelfth sighting re- port received by the study group for June 15, 1975. Below each, case number is an area-time listing. The first two letters are state prefices (AL - Alabama). The second two let- ters indicate which county the sighting . took place in (BA - Baldwin; MO - Mobile). The last four digits indicate local time (24 hour clock). Example: ALM02140 would read that the sighting occurred at 9:40 p.m. in the county of Mobile and state of Alabama.

Page 7"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"Possible hoax involved f Clovis, NM, 'UFO 1 was unfocused Saturn By Ray Stanford Director, Project Starlight International The illustrations with this article graphically demonstrate the true nature (Saturn) of the object photographed by Scott Price of the Clovis News-Jour- nal. A team of five staff members from Project Starlight Inter- national's (P.S.I.) Laboratory of Instrumented UFO Research arrived in Clovis, N.M., on Sunday night, Jan. 25, 1976, in the lab's four-wheel-drive mobile van. Although high winds and ex- treme cold prevented setting up the normal array of monitoring equipment, the Precision Moni- toring Systems automatic re- cording magnetometer was put into operation on the eastern outskirt of Clovis. Nothing in any way unusual was either seen or monitored. The Price photos Because the speciality of P. S.I. is instrumented UFO hard- data, the P.S.I, crew and I focused much of our effort at Clovis on investigation of two photographs made by reporter Scott Price through a small re- fractor telescope belonging to Steve Muscato, a local youth. I was told by several per- . sons, including reporter Price, that for at least two nights prior to the Friday picture taking session, Muscato had set up his telescope in the same place (Room 901, Hotel Clovis). On those consecutive occasions, Muscato had showed groups of people to quote Scott Price, \"...an object remarkably simi- lar to, or identical to, the one I photographed through Steve's telescope and at the same position in the sky.\" On each of the three nights the \"similar or identical\" ob- ject performed in precisely the Page 8 same way: \"It SLOWLY SANK TO- WARD THE WEST between 2:30 a.m. and --not long before sun-up,\" said reporter Price. Soctt Price allowed me to examine, under magnification, the whole strip of Tri-X film on which the \"UFO\" had been photographed. The first one on the film was totally dissimilar to the second and well-publi- cized one. Apparently the first shot had not been published be- cause it was obviously nothing but a smeared image, due to camera motion and object motion (due to earth's rotation). The.second image smear just happened to produce an outline reminiscent of a domed disc. The reporter was quick to point out, however, that the object in no way resembled the photo image. Instead, it was the out- of-focus Saturn image shown in the accompanying illustration which is superimposed over the publicized Clovis photo, to show how the Image was obtained. Object slowly drifted Price described how he and Muscato had to keep adjusting both the telescope position and that of the camera \"...because of the object's slow drift to the west\" during the nearly two hours it took them to get the set-up for obtaining photos (Muscato got some of his own in color). As of Monday, Jan. 26, about four days later, Muscato had, according to Price, MADE NO EFFORT TO HAVE THE COLOR SHOTS DEVELOPED. One may be justified in asking if, maybe, . Muscato, sensed (or even ac- tually knew) it was Saturn he had been showing people for three nights in a row—in the very same position and \"slowly drifting into the west\" (Price). If Muscato were keep- ing the telescope out of focus DELIBERATELY,, knowing that it gave a stranger image when not focused, then we may have a/new Image of unfocused Saturn as seen through telescope. type of UFO hoax on record. Considering the fact that Mus- cato apparently lied to an Aus- tin AMERICAN-STATESMAN reporter who telephoned him, telling the reporter that he and not Scott Price had actually taken the photo reproduced herewith, we might be justified to wonder if he would also deliberately un- focus Saturn to deceive others. One thing is known for sure: several blocks away another group of persons were also watching the western sky from about 2:30 a.m. to 4:30 a.m. or later. From one of that group I learned that \"there simply wasn't any UFO in the sky at the time. We watched the yel- low^white object Steve was showing others from the hotel. IT WAS JUST SATURN.\" Saturn, it turns out, was in line with the Earth and the sun (Earth between the two), giving an exceptionally flat and whitish quality to the light. The Clovis skies were clear and cold, making stars * and planets look brilliant and f outstanding. What Price photo- graphed through Muscato's tele- scope was definitely Saturn. Sighting at Texaco But a few miles west of Clo- vis in Texaco, Texas, on Friday night, Jan. 23, law officer Willie Ronquillo, his seven- teen-year-old son, and Lt. Jim Clayton of the New Mexico State Police, saw an,object the des- cription of which does not as"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"Composite showing how image was obtained on film. readily lend itself to an ex- planation. Others may have seen the same object, even after it reported- ly headed northwest toward Tu- cumcari, NM., where,., at least one person (said to be an ama- teur astronomer) saw it. That object, as seen at seemingly close-range by the Ronquillos, was described as having a : ca- noe-shaped visible portion with at least five lights on exten- sions beneath it. The : canoe- shaped portion was said to have been illuminated only from be- low, and by the lights. Two front lights were said to be \"blue-white,\" while three rear ones were described as flashing blue and yellow intermittently. Thus, it is possible that at least one strange object was seen and reported in the Texas- New Mexico border area (Texaco and Tucumcari), but the P.S.I, staff was able to easily find astronomical explanations for each of a dozen or more- sight- ings reported to them in Clo- vis. Nothing to monitor The purpose of the New Mexi- co trip in the P.S.I, \"mobilab\" was to monitor with instruments any UFOs in the area. There seemed to be none to monitor, so the staff looked at the next best thing—the claimed UFO photos. They turned out to be interesting only in illustrat- ing how persons unfamiliar with the sky can be misled, • and how poor photographic technique can produce photos that show some- thing superficially very dif- ferent from .the object (Saturn) • at which?the camera is pointed.. Identifying the \"noise\" P.S.I, has been criticized by some UFO researchers, who cannot stand to face reality, for releasing•*the Saturn ex- planation to the press, but only by such a process, per- haps, will the public become sufficiently careful as to pro- vide less UFOlogical \"noise\" misidentified as \"signal.\" n, Furthermore, once \"noise\" has been publicized as \"signal\" it is the duty of honest UFO investigators to retell it like it is. There is one. trouble- some element in such affairs though. Some \"researchers,\" all too ready to gain \"scienti- fic\" acceptance, tend to drum up explanations that do not fit the case. Another Texas \"UFO researcher\" (not connected with P.S.I.), as it happens, after a visit to Clovis, was quick to go to the press and _. tell them that what Price photographed was the planet Venus. He did not bother to notice that Venus was near the EASTERN horizon when 'Price was photo- graphing Saturn in the WEST. In fact, Venus is NEVER in the WESTERN sky in the early morn- ing hours—it's orbit is simply too near the sun for that I . It is hoped that UFO re- searchers learn not to jump to either negative or positive conclusions before all the facts are examined. In that context, the Clovis \"sightings\" may have at least a little value to serious researchers. As it was, the Clovis photos gave some astronomers something to sit back and chuckle about-- and so did one too-ready-to-ex- plain UFO investigator whoj since he obviously does not know the early morning sky, might at least have consulted a monthly guide to astronomical conditions, in order to avoid a pseudo-scientific pronounce- ment.

September 26, 1975; Asser- vent, nr Maubeuge, France. A- bout 9:30 p.m. a huge round UFO from which a smaller cone- shaped object emerged was seen by a reserve Air Force officer and a friend. While driving a- cross a field trying to ap- proach the hovering UFO, the witness's car motor and head- lights went out. Continuing on foot, the two men walked on through the field to a hedge, at which point the UFO was still an estimated 300 meters away. (NOSTRADAMUS #184, Octo- ber 15, 1975. Credit: Jean Bastide. Translation by Lex Mebane. This remarkable case, including several unusual feature, is being written in more-detail for SKYLOOK). May 18, 1975; Rainhill, nr Liverpool, England. At 10 p.m. three witnesses saw an unusual object slowly descending over a barn and across fields. It ap- peared as three pulsing white, globular lights. One witness walked across the field and noted a white glow illuminating a tree-lined hollow in the field. He and the others heard a faint humming sound. Next day four strange looking im- prints were found in the mud leading up to a small duck pond in the hollow. The prints were 14 inches by 16 inches, squar- ish and with no visible instep. Distance between them was 45 inches. They .were heavily im- printed, and a scuffed stone was found inside one of the prints. (BUFORA Journal, Sept- Oct., 1975).

I continue to stress the fact that these creatures, even though very similar to the Big- foot of the Pacific Northwest, are apparently not the same species. The main differentia- tion between the two species is that the typical Bigfoot crea- ture has a huge 5-toed human- like footprint, whereas these other creatures are - predomin- ately 3 and 4 toed. This latter variety.has also displayed the unusual characteristic of hav- ing self luminescent eyes that glow in the dark. Over the . years there have been many hundreds of sightings of these huge hairy, giant an- thropoidal creatures, yet there were very few.cases that pre- sented any evidence that UFO sightings could be involved. In the last several months, however, there seems to be a nationwide increase in cases that do present such evidence. Sightings of this nature have been reported in Ohio, Massa- chusetts, West Virginia, Penn- sylvania, Indiana, Montana, and California, as well as in num- erous other states. In some instances UFO sight- ings become active in an area just prior to sightings of the creatures. In other cases a 'JP9 has been observed at exact- ly ;;!ie sane time as a creature. In some isolated instances, either UFO landing traces or physical evidence of the crea- tures have been left behind after their departure. The following are some recent ex- imples of these cases.

First of all, simply taking a geiger-mueller counter to a suspected area of radiation in the investigation of UFOs and looking at the needle response and assigning a designated reading is not the proper sci- entific method of radiation monitoring. This process will tell you absolutely nothing, since there are many factors which have'; to be taken into consideration in radiation monitoring. The 'most important factor is the type of geiger-mueller tube and the calibration of this in- strument. After -an extended period of time, usually every sixth month, the geiger-mueller counter has to be ' recalibrated to assure accuracy. If this is not done, it makes no difference how we11-trained and scientifically-minded the monitoring personnel may be. Any scientific instrument that is to give precision readings must be properly handled and cared for in order to assure the accuracy of the instrument and the results obtained. The next most important fac- tor is to know your instrument, and know.it well. In knowing the various types of radiation- al monitoring instruments and what their limits of operating value may be, one will have the maximum operating value • with the least determinate errors which introduce a constant er- ror into the data. In this article, I will not possibly be able to explain all the basic fundamentals of pro- cedures and methods of radia- tion monitoring, but I will briefly • give you some idea as to the inability of most indi- viduals to properly monitor and measure radiation correctly. Page 12 There are two basic types of radiational monitoring instru- ments, the Geiger-Mueller scal- er/ratemeter and the Geiger- Mueller Portable Survey Meter. The G-M survey meter is not a precise instrument for ex- posure rate measurements, but it is very useful in DETECTING radiation. Geiger tubes are available in a variety of forms, the most common being the end-window variety and the side-window variety. Geiger tubes are not equally sensitive to alpha, beta and gamma radiations. This is ex- plained by considering both the properties, of the radiation and the properties of the Geiger tube. .Alpha particles, being the least penetrating, may be ab- sorbed by the window unless it is very thin. Beta particles are more penetrating and gamma rays are very penetrating. Thus thicker windows can be toler- ated with the latter two types of radiation. The efficiency of the Geiger tube is essentially 100% for alpha particles, nearly 100% for beta particles but only 1 or 2% for gamma radiation. Side-window tubes are useless for the detection of alpha par- ticles, but are quite useful for the detection of energetic betas. On the other hand, side- window tubes are more sensitive to gamma radiation than .are end-window tubes presenting the same cross-section to the radi- ation. The thicker window in- creases the probability of in- teraction of the gamma rays to eject an ionizing electron. More sophisticated The scaler-ratemeter is a much more sophisticated instru- ment designed to both display the total number of counts and also the count rate. This in- strument is a must if one is to monitor and measure the radia- tion properly. A direct reading gamma pocket dosimeter is a must for anyone considering the monitoring or measuring of a suspected area for radiation. With a scale of (0-200 mr), the amount of mil- liroentgens per hour or per unit period of time of exposure will be able to be determined. There are many different types of pocket dosimeters, such as the thermal neutron dosimeter, fast neutron dosimeter, and gamma dosimeter, etc. How NOT to do it Survey monitoring of an area for radiation is NOT conducted in the following manner. 1. Walking into an area and then turning on the radiation monitoring equipment. . 2. Walking into an area WITHOUT A DOSIMETER. 3. Walking into an area without checking the background count of .that specific area first. 4. Not knowing the safe levels of radiation exposure. 5. Handling something which could be radioactive. 6. Not taking precautionary safety measures. 7. Not knowing the instru- ment you possess or basic know- ledge of radiation physics. How to do it The PROPER way to conduct survey monitoring of an area for radiation is as follows: 1. Be sure that the instru- ment that you have is calibrat- ed (and that the batteries are good). 2. Be sure to have a direct gamma pocket dosimeter on your- self. 3.

Halogen-quenched tubes show a background of 30 to 40 counts per minute. Background radia- tion will produce an error in measurements of radioactivity unless the background count is determined and subtracted from the total activity. The dif- ference between the total acti- vity and the background is the net activity of the sample. Background count may change during the course of monitoring the source and should always be determined both at the begin- ning and at the'.end of the working period. : R, =baekground count rate R =R-R=net sample count rate R =total count rate (sample plus background) R's. - ' - v '• \"4. If there is an indication of -an abnormal amount of radia- tion present, the use of the Inverse Square Law should be applied. All types of radiation emitted by radioactive materi- als propagate outward in straight lines unless absorbed or scattered by materials, in their, paths.. , As. the -.radiation gets farther from the source, the intensity, (radiation per unit area) is reduced because the same radiation is spread over a larger area. The intensity I,, at distance d., is greater than the intensi- ty I 2 at a distance d-. The intensities are related by: The distance above the ground of the G-M tube should be care- fully recorded, as well as the distance from the \"supposed source\" and the G-M tube should always be oriented.the same way •-.-.- • ^^ a^-~ \"We're going 10 nave 10 stop cringing tarim.ng; ebotrd lor physical .examinations . .

Leo Sprinkle Location: Firnekas Ranch, about 25 miles northwest of Midwest, WY. Date: late 1975, early 1975 (various sightings). Investigated by R. Leo Sprinkle, Ph.D. Type of sighting: nocturnal lights. Background Charlie Firnekas, owner of a 17,000-acre ranch on the line between Natrona and Johnson counties, stated that on one Autumn evening he had seen a \"comet\" (meteorite) which seemed to perform in an unusual manner; it moved quickly, but in a horizontal direction. On another occasion, he watched for three and a half hours one night while a \"helicopter\" was seen in the area; \" however, there was no loud sound as one would expect from a helicopter in the area: there was a sound like a truck motor. On Nov. 2, 1975, Firnekas returned from a Woolgrowers As- sociation meeting; he said that he saw a light like a \"car\" but did not meet it on the road. He was driving on a divide close to the town of Kaycee, near the Sussex road, but he did not see the lights until he was near the town; at that point he could see the light between the ranch house and the adjoining bluff, which is sev- eral hundred yards away. Coming from Casper (Nov. 10?), Firnekas saw a light from the east; then another light came by and passed the first light. Later, he could see them both from the front window .of the ranchhouse. Jim Zimmerschied, who works as range detective on the ranch, spends much of his time on the range during night hours, checking on possible rustling activities; thus, he is able, on many occasions, to observe the \"lights\" or ob- jects. On one occasion he saw four lights, less than one mile a- way, between him and the \"wall\" Page 16 or nearby bluffs. Radio inter- ference was noticeable on the \"low frequency\" state radio channel. On another occasion, Marshall Young and Zimmerschied looked to the north, .around midnight, and saw . lights which appeared to be \"whiter\" than car lights. Zimmerschied sat for two hours watching the. Vcar 1 -' mov- ing; he expected it to come closer on the road toward his location. After turning back, the light came on again. He waited for two hours but the lights did not show. The next morning he investigated, but found no camp or other signs of any person in the area. The range . detective has tried \"sneaky\" and \"brazen\" ap- proaches, but he never is able to get close enough to identify specifically what is, being ob- served. He believes that the phenomena are harmless; he al- so speculates on the possibil- ity that they may be surveying devices • which are operated by foreign countries, checking on mineral deposits in the area. A whirring sound On one occasion, Bill Dixson, county trapper, and Zimmer- schied drove to .the \"Wall\" without their headlights being used. It was a foggy night, and they used, radio communica- tion to keep in touch with Fir- nekas, who was parked on the bluff across the way. - They heard a , whirring sound like a \"mortor\" shell, which they per- ceived as being below their po- sition. As they . talked with Firnekas, they learned that he had seen a moving light .at the same time; he saw the light as being below the position of Zimmerschied and Dixon, al- though , it .appeared to be in front of a smaller bluff be- tween the two locations. Fir- nekas estimated the light as being one fourth mile in front of the bluff on which Zimmer- schied and Dixon were located. Cattle .mutilations Both Firnekas and Zimmers- chied said that there had been four-cattle mutilations in the area. During that period, for } two weeks, there were many | lights on every ridge in the 1 area. As far as they can de- ' termine, there has been no ; \"loss of time\" experience as- sociated with any of these sightings. On one Sunday, around the , first of , October, Firnekas ! heard a sound; he went outside with his gun, but the noise faded. He watched a light for three and a half hours that night. Sometime around Nov. 1, a \"truck\" was seen by Firnekas and Z immers chi ed, who were ac- companied by two other people. The \"truck\" seemed to have a variety of, lights,, including red lights. They watched the \"truck\" move in an area where there was one foot of snow and the roads were \"blocked,\" - ex- cept for two approaches. Fir- nekas and Zimmerschied and Fir- nekas. 1 wife and a Mr. Apodaca watched for 30 or 40 minutes. When they attempted to go into the area, the high snowdrifts prevented any travel. Because of the bad weather, they were not able to look the next day; however, on the fo.l - lowing day, they flew a light airplane over the area and saw the tracks of their own vehic- les but they did not. see any \"truck\" tracks. The country is very rugged; Firnekas knows the area quite well, as he travels to keep .track of his cattle and sheep. Thus, . it is unlikely that any \"truck\" could get in and out of the f ranch without his being aware of the vehicle. On , Nov. 14, 1975, Zimmer- schied had driven out on a flat area, around 1:30 a.m., within the location of Tisdale Moun- tain to^the left and the \"Wall\" to the right. He. said that a light came. out from behind a"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"rock formation (Castle Rock) and within two miles of his car (he could estimate the distance because of the closeness to the mountains). Another light ap- peared on his right. He said that he placed two small pieces of tape in an \"X\" position on the left window and another \"cross\" on the right window. Then, he could keep the lights in view as they moved slowly from their origin- al .position. He - said that -he dropped a coat outside of his car, so that he would know how far his vehicle had traveled during the half hour period. The light on the right remained on a steady horizontal posi- tion, while the light on the left went up and down five times, within the 30 minutes. He estimated 30 yards, was the distance.between the half hour pattern of \"movements.\" From 1:30 a.m. to 5 a.m., he maintained his observations; he estimated that he had traveled a ;total distance of two miles. He does not know what the pat- tern ;means, although he specu-; lates „ that it could . be.. some kind of survey being conducted in the area. . • \". I made;, plans to drive to Casper, WY, ,on Friday, Dec. 19, 1975. Other members of the University of Wyoming who have expressed interest in UFO in- vestigations were, invited to join.-the group: .Norm Kjome, Dave Martell, and Dr. Dave Mc- Elroy. (Kjome is a research associate in the Department of Physics and Astronomy; Martell is an engineer in the Depart- ment of Physics and Astronomy; and McElroy is an assistant professor in Curriculum and In- struction in the College of Education.) . We carried some items of equipment: binoculars, a small hand telescope, camera, and re- cording equipment. We met Dep- uty 'Sheriff John Lewis at the Sheriff's Office around 7- p.m.; and drove to the ranch of\"Mr. Firnekas, approximately 65 miles north of Casper.. Deputy Sheriff.: Lewis 'had equipment with his four-wheel drive ve- hicle, including a 40-power scope mounted on his window, and a \"StarTron,\" a light-in- tensifying viewing instrument. When we arrived at the ranch, we talked,...with Firnekas, and Zimmerschied. - Both ..men ;were •open and pleasant in their dis- cussion, describing 'the various events in which they have.par- ticipated during .the . past few months. After the discussion, we went in two vehicles and drove out several miles west and north where the \"lights\" often have been. .seen, almost on, a daily basis, .during the past four months. We watched the phenom- ena from 11 p.m. Friday until 1 a.m. Saturday, Dec. 20, 1975. . There was a full moon, with clear skies; the temperature was 22 degrees; the humidity was 46%; there was a steady breeze from the southwest. Observations .-were made look- ing to the north (a few degrees east of a line below. the North Star.) Orange lights were seen which behaved in an,.unusual pattern. The .lights were per- ceived, as being -\"on the hori- zon\" or below the horizon, be- tween our location and distant bluffs. Approximately 10'.-miles to the north is a little \"spur\" on highway .-. 190. . However, the country is rough and it is not likely that there would be any car which would be seen in the area, or which would be seen between the far bluffs and the location of our -observation. The StarTron viewer :would have assisted us to see any highway or road in the immediate area; also, our viewing instruments could have assisted us to per- ceive car \"headlights\" at.the estimated distance. The lights appeared, as bright, or brighter, than \"evening stars\" or planets. However, the brightness may have been-due to a . \"glare\" ef- fect as the lights were .first noticed; also, the brightness may have been, due. to the ex- citement of the observers. On occasion, three lights were seen with one light moving slowly to the right (east), ap- parently .passing the other two lights, to._ a point approximate- ly the width of a finger held at arm's length. Then, sudden- ly, the light wouldextinguish, only to \"reappear\"; or,'a sim- ilar light ...would ..appear, and repeat, the pattern. ' On one oc- casion, there were.: three lights in one area, with two other lights farther to the right.and another, light farther to the right, .approximately. northeast.   , It was possible to distin- guish between these lights and another . light which Zimmer- schied and Firnekas identified as an oil rig light. The light on the oil rig appeared to be a \"white\" electric light; Zimmer- schied and Firnekas state that it can be seen daily as a \"steady\" light, with no fluctu- ations;, or variation in inten- sity. However, the lights which we saw varied in their inten- sity, as well as in their move- ments.. On two occasions, we decided to \"get closer.\" The vehicles were driven to other high points, over rough trails, in hopes that we could have a bet-: ter vantage point.. However,, each time the lights were per- ceived as no farther away and no closer. During one observation, Dep- uty Sheriff Lewis said that he could distinguish a reddish \"body\" or \"object\" when the \"light\" extinguished. Others of us, looking through the 40- power telescope, concurred with that observation. Dave Martell said that he could see what ap- peared to be a vertical \"line\" extending from the lights to the ground below. • The lights did not appear to move above the horizon; how- ever, on occasions, the lights appeared to be between our lo- cation and distant bluffs, which were estimated to be two or three.miles away. . Various hypotheses were dis r cussed by the members of the party, but no definite decision about the best hypothesis could be reached. Interest on the part of the members of the party is high, and it is hoped that there may be another opportunity when we can return to this area, for further investigation.

I regret to report that Bernard O'Connor has resigned as editor of OFFI- CIAL UFO, although he has put together the issues through Oc- tober of this year. It is my feeling that Bernie did a fine job as editor and I am very sorry to see him leave. Now for some capsule reviews and news of recent and forth- coming books: Coral and Jim Lorenzen's ENCOUNTERS WITH UFO OCCUPANTS is now available in a Berkley paperback for $1.95. A very good summary of Ufonaut and abduction cases. Essential- ly an update of their 1967 book, FLYING SAUCER OCCUPANTS. Includes chapters by Walter N. Webb on the Betty Hill/Marjorie Fish \"star map\" research and Dr. R. Leo Sprinkle on the use of hypnosis and the psychic as- pects of UFO research. Good Page 18 By Lucius Parish reading. A new booklet by Loren Gross is always welcome and his lat- est one, CHARLES FORT, THE FOR- TEAN SOCIETY AND UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS, is no excep- tion. Covering the period from August, 1895 through August, 1947, it is an excellent sum- mary of UFO events during those years. No price is given on the copy I received, but • it will certainly .be worth your time to write to Mr. Gross (38675 Paseo Padre #305 - Fre- mont, CA 94536) and inquire. You might also ask about the availability of his two pre- vious booklets, THE UFO WAVE OF 1896 and THE MYSTERY OF THE GHOST ROCKETS. All three pub- lications are outstanding. THE AMNESIA FACTOR by J. H. Mathes § Lenora Huett is another volume dealing with communica- tions with \"higher intelligen- ces.\" The portions dealing with UFOs,,are highly intriguing and provi'de seemingly logical answers for such curious events as the Donald Schrum \"Bow and Arrow Case\" which took place in California in 1964. I can only suggest that you read it and form your own conclusions. The book is a large paperbound edi- tion, selling for $4.95 from Celestial Arts - 231 Adrian Rd. r Milibrae, CA 94030. Allen Greenfield has been in Ufology for the past 16 years or so, publishing a number of various periodicals during that time. He now has a book avail- able which examines various theories of UFO origins and provides an interesting review of UFO research through the years. The personalities of \"middle Ufology\" abound in this book, as well as Allen's views of the \"official\" - UFO research groups. SAUCERS AND SAUCERERS is the title and it may be ordered from Allen (P.O. Box 98214, Briarcliff Branch - At- lanta, GA 30359). Only $1.00 and it's worth it. It has been more than a month since I read I WAS PICKED UP BY A UFO by John H. Womack and I still don't know what to think about it! In some ways, it is a more or less typical abduc- tion story, (if there is such a thing), but the beings Womack describes are unlike any I've read about previously. If Wo- mack is putting us on he has a good imagination; if not, his story should be investigated. His booklet is rather thin and somewhat overpriced at $3.25, but if you want to read about his experiences, copies are a- vailable from The Helms Publi- cations - 1108 6th Street West - Cullman, AL 35055. UFOs: WHAT ON EARTH IS HAP- PENING? by John Weldpn with Zola Levitt is another of those volumes which seeks to convince us that demons are responsible for all UFO activity. Person- ally, I regard that theory as a very poor substitute for ra- tional thinking. The original paperbound edition is available from Harvest House Publishers (Irvine, CA 92707) for $2.95. A Bantam paperback edition is also available on newsstands. George Friedrich's book, U. P.O. OR GOD?, is another at- tempt to explain Biblical \"mir- acles 1 ' and other phenomena in a UFO context. While Mr. Fried- rich's conclusions may be sub- ject to question, he does pro- vide some intriguing data and speculations. The book is a- vailable from Carlton Press - 84 Fifth Avenue - New York, N. Y. The price is $3.95. Forthcoming books include: THE FIRE CAME BY by Baxter § Atkins (the 1908 Siberian ex- plosion) , coming out shortly from Doubleday.

The expanded forms should also provide a much more thorough data bank for research and analysis. Each member should be familiar with the contents of the Manual. However, in the big picture, something essential is missing. During a recent visit in Se- guin, Jim McCampbell and your .director had an opportunity to explore this question and to assess the current state of our affairs. The basic need appears 1 to be an increase in participa- tion by our Advisory Board of Consultants, stimulation of specific investigations, and exchange of information. A letter has been mailed to • all MUFON consultants suggest- ing a detailed three-step pro- gram that we feel is worthy of their attention and support in specific technical investiga- tions, experiments, assign- ments, and a consultant's News- letter to publicize the prog- gress. Authors of submitted material will sometimes be requested to prepare a version of their work that would be suitable for the more general readership of SKY- LOOK. We feel that such mater- ial will greatly help in up grading the scientific stature and value of our magazine.

State Director Appointed Brent M. Raynes, Perkins By Walt Andrus Lane, Hollowell, Maine 04347; Telephone: (207) 623-4614, has been selected as the state di- rector for Maine. For the past four weeks, he has been working closely with Charles and Geri Wilhelm of the Ohio UFO Invest- igators League, Inc. in Fair- field, Ohio. Through the outstanding work of Ted Bloecher, MUFON 1 s New York State organization has been significantly strength- ened. Ted has nominated and Benton Jamison, Ph.D. of Del- mar, New York has agreed to ac- cept the position of State Di- rector for New York. Due to Benton\"s central location in the State (Albany is the State Capital), we are confident that with his administrative ability and interest in the UFO phenom- enon, he will be better able to work closer with our State Sec- tion Directors. Benton is the department head of Mathematics at the State Un- iversity of New York at Albany. Dr. Jamison has appointed Rich- ard Bonenfant to succeed him as state section director for Al- bany, Rensselaer, Saratoga and Schenectady counties. Richard is an assistant research scien- tist employed by the State of New York, Department of Health, and, in addition, a very compe- tent field investigator, based upon his detailed reports. Ted Bloecher will continue as co-chairman, with David Webb, of MUFON's Humanoid Study Group. He will also assume his prior responsibility as state section director for New York City (Queens, Richmond, Kings, Bronx), Nassau and Suffolk counties. Through the coopera- tion of Robert Clayton and Ted Bloecher, Lewis H. LaFontaine, Calkins Road, Plattsburgh, New York 12901; Telephone: (518) 561-3770, has agreed to serve as the state section director for Clinton and Franklin coun- ties. Michael A. Delhom, 119-E Of- fard, Lafayette, Louisiana 70501; Telephone: (318) 235- 4142, has been appointed state section director for Lafayette, St. Martin, Acadia, St. Landry, Vermillion and Iberia Parishes in Louisiana. Mike has a B.A. with two years of electronics training and two years of as- tronomy in college. Other com- petent individuals are needed to provide greater coverage in the State of Louisiana. Radar Consultant Robert F. Bowker, B.S.E.E., 889 Camino El Carrizo, Thousand Oaks, California 91360, has as- sumed the additional responsi- bility of a Consultant in Ra- dar. Visitors at MUFON headquarters On April 28 and 29, we had the pleasure of a visit from Yu \"Masaru\" Mori of Chiba City, Japan, a MUFON Field Investiga- tor; Nobuyuki Naitou, editorial staff of the bi-weekly magazine \"GORO\" from Tokyo, Japan; and Dennis W.

Vallee cancels Symposium talk Jacques Vallee has advised that he will be unable to speak at MUFON's 1976 UFO Symposium on June 12 due to a conflict with the dates that he is fly- ing with his sons to France.

If we take at face value oc- cupant sightings such as the January 1975 O'Barski case, the August 1975 Mrs. S.L. case, and the November 1975 Walton case, along with many similar reports including Barney and Betty Hill and Charles Hickson, they col- lectively point toward one con- clusion: the operators of UFOs are intensively studying our earth scientifically—our phy- siology, our flora and fauna, and our energy sources. This, in turn, suggests to me that there probably are vast differences between them and us which prevent freer contact if indeed they want contact. Of course, it is a tricky question how many and which occupant and Director's message (Continued from page 19) be rescheduled into the pro- gram. Jerome \"Jerry\" Clark, MUFON state section director from Minnesota, has agreed to fill the vacancy created in the pro- gram. Ron Westrum and Ted Peters have both submitted pub- lished papers for the 1976 MUFON UFO Symposium Proceedings in addition to the regular speakers. Richard H. Hall, in- ternational coordinator, will moderate one of the workshop sessions dealing with foreign UFO reports. Photo analysis MUFON is indebted to William H. Spaulding and associates in Ground Saucer Watch (GSW) for their computerized analysis or possible UFO photographs that our members have submitted. Bill also serves as MUFON state director for Arizona and a con- sultant in photo analysis. Page 20 close encounter cases can safe- ly be taken at face value. Our Editor correctly distinguishes between thoroughly analyzed cases and preliminary news re- ports still requiring thorough checking. As in the February 1976 Ala- bama and New York car-following cases and other examples, UFOs continue to display an irordin- ate (by our standards) interest in human vehicles. This also could be caused by a disparity between their technology and ours. In two of the cases reported in this issue, an ordinary car radio and a Citizen's Band ra- dio were totally blacked-out by forces presumably incidental to the UFOsi With the seemingly vast energies at their dispos- al, the UFO beings may be puz- zled about what makes our \"bugs\" go and curious to find out. The image comes to mind of the Ririe, Idaho, UFO occupants (11/2/67) sliding behind the wheel of the car and pushing the passengers aside. .Although fanciful, I can also imagine the following conversation be- tween UFO occupants who have just lifted a car off the road and set it down in another place: \"See, Glrtz, their ve- hicles can levitate just like ours. Why don't they do it?\" If the UFO occupants obtain their biological energy by some means other than eating (the food cycle), and their motive power from some more exotic source than fossil fuels or rudimentary atomic energy, our culture and technology could be baffling to them and worthy of scientific investigation for that reason. In an article for OFFICIAL UFO (if accepted for publica- tion) , I examine some of the reasons why a cultural/technol- ogical gap could explain our inability to understand what we are seeing, and possibly also some of the reasons for their difficulties in deciphering our technology and behavior. We are quite prepared to consider extraterrestrials as rough equals, so that they should easily understand us and we should be able to figure them out. It seems to me that we are both underestimating how , different they might be, and overestimating how easily they should understand us. Our human conceit that extraterrestrials might be only SLIGHTLY advanced over us technologically dis- torts our perspective. Perhaps we ought to be con- sidering, the possibility that in all respects of science, technology, and power we are so vastly inferior that despite some similarity of biol'ogical form we are essentially pawns in their game. After all, chimpanzees resemble us biolo- gically. . stronomy Nates By Mark R.
