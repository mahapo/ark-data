FROM THE EDITOR To say that some humanoid and close encounter UFO cases contain elements of \"high strangeness\" is to understate the matter. Some of the reports can only be described as \"bizarre\" and \"incredible.\" We serve notice here that their inclusion in the Journal does not necessarily imply \"belief\" or acceptance, only a conviction that such reports — when carefully investigated— deserve serious consideration in the attempt to unravel the baffling UFO mystery. Some may prove to be hoaxes, or hallucinations, but some may also be true and, therefore, the most important data of all. The whole point is that we won't know what to think without investigation, and writing off such reports as \"impossible\" would substitute preconception for scientific study. We do not intend to ignore close encounters of the first and second kind, examples of which appear in this issue, since they constitute the basis for even considering the possible validity of CE-III cases. Even if we make the unlikely assumption that all humanoid reports are false, there still remains a large body of data establishing UFOs as a serious and important problem. We intend to explore al! facets of the UFO mystery in a continuing search for the truth.

This event was made widely known the next day by the principal radio stations and in the newspaper El Vocero. On Saturday the 16th, we succeeded in having a long interview with the witness, and with the neighbors who were witnesses of the final part of the appearance, as well as making an excursion to the spot where it happened. In our investigation we were accompanied by our friend Jorge Martin, who, with his skill in drawing, was able to illustrate graphically the statements of the principal witness. We will now put down the main statements of Sr. de Olmos as to how the appearance occurred: On Tuesday the 12th, around 8:30 or 9 at night, I was on the balcony of my house, resting and taking the fresh air. Suddenly, something came up from the finca (farm) which is opposite the house. There emerged from the darkness of the place a very small figure, passing underneath the barbed- wire fence. At first I thought it was a child who was playing...but then I noticed that he was a very strange being because of his equipment...and I realized that he was someone I would have to treat cautiously. He came on, walking normally, up to the light — up to a street-light post which was opposite the house. I then called to my daughter Irasema, while he was moving cautiously to the post, which bore a mercury light. I asked her to get me a pencil and paper, to see if I could sketch the figure. I told her to put on the light in the room, but she made a mistake and turned on the outside light. Now the \"animal\" was almost up to the lamp- post, but on seeing the light he was frightened. He looked up toward the light, and I think that he was coming as if looking for something — an energy or current — because he was making directly for the lamp post. In his right hand he had a small object that was shiny. The light fell on the crystal helmet that he wore, and showed that it was a tremendous thing. Then, when my light came on, he started running toward the fence. He passed under the barbed wire and then he stopped. He put his hands on his belt, in front, and there lighted up a box that he had on his back, like a knapsack, producing a sound like that of an electric drill, and then he rose up and went away toward the trees. The neighbors and my family by this time had come out, and saw the lights going from one tree to another for about ten minutes, after which they were lost from sight. Details Of the Humanoid The strange being was 3.5 feet. tall. According to the witness, he saw him when he came out of the darkness of the farm directly opposite his residence. The humanoid bent over and passed under a barbed-wire fence, \"walking normally, like a child.\" His proportions were normal except that his arms were short. His whole body was covered with a green garment that seemed to be \"inflated by air,\" because it was not fastened to the body of the creature. His head was covered by a helmet of metallic appearance, which on its upper part changed into a sort of antenna, on the point of which \"there was a little light or flame.\" From the helmet itself, of a lighter green than the garment, there came out on each side \"something that looked like pointed ears.\" The helmet was joined to the garment by a dark fringe at neck level. He had some kind of crystal (glass) from his forehead to his neck in front, and it strongly reflected the light of the street lamp, making it impossible to see the creature's face. The humanoid walked cautiously toward the lamp post, reaching within about 10 feet of it, and about 30 feet from where the witness was. At this moment the witness was able to note that the strange being hejd something \"the size of a matchbox, shiny, ending in a point\" in his right hand. Meanwhile he was looking fixedly toward the lamp post. This action made the witness think that the humanoid wanted in some manner to test, or take, electrical energy. It was then that by a mistake, the witness's daughter, Irasema de Olmos Padin, 16, lighted the bulb on the balcony. Then the humanoid \"started running back to where he had come from,\" passed underneath the fence wires, ard stopped, turning his back to the witness. He was able to note that on his back, like a knapsack, the humanoid wore \"a little box fastened on with two straps,\" and that he had a tail which did not reach the ground. (See the drawing.) Immediately the strange being \"raised his hands to the belt — a wide, heavy belt — that he was wearing\" and immediately there lighted up, in the box on his back, \"two red lights and two blue ones,\" giving the impression that they were turning. Between the two pairs of lights the box had \"an opening or something.\" When the lights went on, from the lower part of the object there emerged two downward-directed jets of light, which the witness says were of the color of \"welding-machine sparks.\" At the same time he heard a humming noise like that of a small electric drill. Next, the humanoid rose up in the direction of the trees nearest the farmhouse, to a height estimated as 10- 12 feet. At this time the daughter of the (Continued on next page) 3"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"(Humanoid Continued) witness came out on the balcony arid was able to see the lights coming out from the supposed propulsive apparatus. Then the wife, Dominga Padin de Olmos, and the son, Rafael Edgardo, of the witness also came outside. What Happened Next According to our inquiry, the humanoid moved off horizontally, \"lifting up his tail,\" and \"like Superman,\" about 420 feet, the distance at which are found the first trees on the farm. By this time a group of neighbors had gathered, listening to what Sr. de Olmos was saying. Among the neighbors there were: Marvel, Daniela and Josefina Gonzalez, Luis, Carlos, and Iris Cortes, Mercedes Medina de Leon, Minerva, Betsaida and Ivi Mena Lugo. All of them were able to see, during the 10 minutes following, that the lights emitted by the box on the creature's back \"were jumping from tree to tree,\" at times coming down to the level of the ground. According to the principal witness, they were able to observe that there was another \"similar light, doing the same.\" This makes him think that there was another \"animal like the one I saw\" which, according to his impression, was \"helping the other,\" because he had had the impression that \"the little dingus on his back wasn't working well\" when it was lighted up, about 40 feet away from the witness. Finally, the phenomenon disappeared, but not before all the neighbors had noted that the cattle of the farm had \"gone crazy,\" running from one place to another and lowing. Several dogs in the neighborhood, including the witness's bitch, \"Luly,\" were barking frantically at the dark farm. After a while, the police patrolmen Jotinny Ramos and William Castro arrived. They were the first of a series of state police who arrived later. The excitement in the neighborhood was such that many mothers were afraid that \"they were carrying off 4 children,\" for which reason the police stayed on guard until dawn. The next day, the news spread like wildfire, and the place was invaded by a hundred curiosity-seekers, made up in great part of the pupils of the town's public school. The same day, the news was given out by several radio stations, and was published in the daily paper El Vocero on Friday the 15th. In spite of extended investiga- tion, the local police have given no explanation of the matter. Observations According to Sr. de Olmos, the nearby presence of the humanoid lasted only about a minute. Details such as that the strange being \"had only four fingers\" and that his feet \"looked like those of a duck\" are of interest among the strange factors of the case, and may be explained by the witness's faculty of observation, because he had a hobby of drawing. Our investigation brought out the fact that the witness is a reliable person and is considered very industrious by all his neighbors. His business consists of the distribution of products for cattle, throughout the entire northeastern zone of the island. He had never been interested in UFO phenomena and similar subjects. \"Now,\" he said to us, \"I believe in those things, and I intend to read up about them.\" As a consequence of his sighting, the witness had intestinal trouble for two days, eating hardly anything and easily irritated, especially by his wife, as she confirms. The witness's son, Rafael Edgardo, 15, found next day tracks which he thought had been left by the humanoid. Another track left on the ground near the street was destroyed by curious people and by rain before it could be photographed. Our investigation of the site 4 days after the event found no physical traces, nor did we find in the area any abnormal reading of magnetism or radioactivity. However, we must mention the finding of a broken-off branch, in process of drying up, on the mango tree toward which, according to the witness, the humanoid had made his way on his incredible flight. This detai, had not been observed by the witness, who does not reject the possibility of its having been produced by the creature. A neighbor woman, who doesn't want to identify herself because of her advanced age, remarked that on Sunday the 10th, two days before the incident, she had seen a luminous object fall in the same place, to which she did not give due attention. The same night as the humanoid, a farmer in the region reported that all his cattle were frightened by some unexplained - happening, jumping at the fences and producing many injuries. Conclusions Although in this case the presence of an unidentified flying object was not reported, the case certainly comes within the limits of UFO phenomenology. It seems that it could be a new aspect, such as occurred principally in the U.S. during the 1973 wave (see Webb, 1973-Year of the Humanoids.) The case occurs unconnected with a UFO case in our country, with the exception of two separate cases reported in Caguas and Rincon in April and May respectively. The reporting of sporadic cases both in time and in space seems to be the predominant characteristic throughout the whole world during 1976 and 1977. Even so, many of the cases reported, such as the one presented here, contain the same puzzling aspects."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"CLOSE-RANGE SIGHTING IN AFRICA By Cynthia Hind (MUFON Representative for Rhodesia) Although the following incident occurred as far back as 18th May, 1958, I only recently came to hear about it, and after advertising in the local newspaper, was lucky enough to be put in touch with the people concerned. Ray Burl was in the Royal Air Force during the war and is a well respected member of the community. Besides, there were several witnesses, so one can hardly think that he pulled this incident 'out of his thumb.' The Burl's were living at the time at 5, Kirkaldy Road, Famona, which is one of the better suburbs of Bulawayo, in Rhodesia. Mr. Burl tells his own story: \"I arrived back from Selukwe at about seven in the evening and in due course my wife Yvonne and I went to bed. At about 10:30, Yvonne, who had been reading in bed whilst I was dozing, suddenly sat up and asked me what that noise was. I had not heard anything, but she described it as a 'rustling' noise, similar to paper being swished about. I was too sleepy to pay much attention and rolled over and slept again. \"At 1:15 AM we were awakened by one of our neighbors at the window. I was a bit alarmed because these neighbors are three women with no man in the house and I immediately thought that they were being disturbed by intruders hanging about. Anyway, that was not the case! They had been up late entertaining one of the girl's fiancee's and on coming out to see him away, they saw a peculiar object in the sky, low down over our house. \"We got up and from the bedroom window could see the 'thing*. We put on our gowns and nipped outside for a better look at it. It was difficult to establish an exact size and shape but it was roughly rectangular and about five by three feet in dimension. It hovered over the house and moved swiftly in both an horizontal plane and a vertical plane, all the time making this rustling noise together with a high-pitched vibrating sound. We watched it for a few moments and then I ran inside to fetch my torch, [flashlight- Ed.]. When I came out again, the object had disappeared. However, the six of us waited and not long after, we heard this 'swish-swish' again and sure enough, down came this strange thing in a spiral movement and once more, hovered over the house, not more than 50-60 ft. up, if that. When it had come as low as it seemed it would, 1 put the beam of the torch on it and lit it up slightly. It's belly was a dull metallic grey color, very faintly luminous. On the torch-light striking it, it shot off in an horizontal plane but I kept the beam on it. It then rose vertically until the torch could no longer hold it and finally shot off, climbing into the heavens and disappeared in a southerly direction. \"It was an eerie experience and left me ice cold. One of the ladies was sick to the stomach and heaved her dinner up and spent the rest of the night being ill on and off — • nerves, I guess. I am positive that it was nothing man- made and nothing that we know on this Earth. It showed no lights and left no trail and except for the faint luminous belly, was difficult to judge as to depth. It looked something like a book which had been opened in the middle and as it hovered, so the extreme edges of what might have been described as it's wings, fluttered in a manner similar to a hawk poised before swooping. That is, there was very little movement at all except for the oscillating at the edges. \"We have, as is I suppose natural, had our legs pulled about it all, but when six adults see the same thing at the same time and are all of the same opinion, my previous skepticism regarding space-craft, flying saucers, call them 'what you will* - exists no longer; so now I think I have seen the lot. Next time, if there is a next time, I hope we will be more prepared and have a powerful spotlight together with cameras, etc. Unfortunately, although the night was a very bright one, there was moon at the time and this thing merged easily with the darkness. There was not a breath of wind or the suggestion of a breeze to keep any other object such as a kite airborne and anyway, it's movements were too fast and sure and varied for it to have been anything remotely resembling or approaching a common or garden kite!\" Subsequent to this \"happening,\" the Burl's baby daughter Gillian (Ginny for short) became ill. They could not understand what was wrong, but the child kept on vomiting — everything that she ate came back as quickly as it went down. They called in the family doctor and he could not understand why the child was so thoroughly dehydrated. Mr. Burl, rather reluctantly, then told the doctor of the family's experience on the Sunday night, and the doctor became somewhat alarmed as he thought the symptoms could have arisen from radiation from the mysterious object. The reason for the sickness was never pinpointed, but the child did recover and has grown up into an attractive young woman. An interesting sidelight to this event is that in 1975,1 sent in a report to MUFON about a Dr. and Mrs. Charles Morris who had an experience with a UFO on the Sinoia-Salisbury Road near the Dyke. The Dyke is a ridge of uneven height running across a section of Rhodesia and known to contain several minerals which are being mined. At 8:30 on Thursday, October 30th, the Morris' noted a light in the sky, which at that time was stationary. They stopped the car to watch it and after a (Continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Australia SHEEP FARMERS SEE UFO RENDEZVOUS (From the Melbourne Herald. April 8, 1978. Submitted by Paul Jackson, MUFON Representative for Tasmania) Two UFOs acting in concert were observed March 30 in the hills near Albury, Australia, by Christopher Kloppenborg, 25, and his brother Geoffrey, 22. The brothers were mustering the sheep about 7:30 AM on \"Old Toonallook,\" their parents' property, when the sighting occurred. \"I was on the motorbike going along the top of the hill when I looked across the valley and saw a large object,\" Geoffrey said. \"My first thought was that it was a plane but then I realized it was too close to the hills and it was stationary....It was very bright--a chrome or mercury color and hovering in the sky above a tree-lined hill. I left the sheep and rode down the hill to get my brother Chris and told him to bring the binoculars.\" Christopher joined his brother at the top of the rise, and could see the object across the valley, casting a shadow on the hillside. They took turns observing it through binoculars for about 5-8 minutes, then Geoffrey headed back to the homestead to get a camera. \"1 realized with rather a shock that it was an unidentified object,\" Christopher said. \"It appeared to have black shapes along its side but I'm not saying whether they were windows or not. We were looking at it from what appeared to be the side and it seemed to be shaped like a short cigar.\" As he heard Geoffrey returning on the motorbike, Christopher saw a second object, smaller and shaped like a stingray, come over the top of the hiOs. \"It swept in a slow arc, then turned beside the bigger craft. They both took off and headed east over bush country.\" As the objects moved off in the distance, Geoffrey arrived, too late to use the camera. \"As I was riding back to where Chris was,\" Geoffrey related, \"I could see a second smaller object coming over the hills toward the big one. It seemed to turn in front of the bigger object and they both disappeared over the hills to the east.\" The boys' parents followed Geoffrey to the valley in a truck, but arrived too late to see the objects. Mrs. Kloppenborg said, \"When we got to the boys Christopher was standing there as white as a sheet. All the blood had drained from his face. They told us what they had seen, but when we discussed it later they asked us not to say anything as they were embarrassed by what they had seen and didn't think anyone would believe them.\" Reporter Richard Willis interviewed the boys separately and confirmed that they were extremely reluctant to talk about the experience. His story lead refers to an \"eerie silence\" that prevailed during the sighting, but this point is not elaborated on in the story. The fact that the large UFO cast a shadow on the hillside established its distance to be about one mile at that point. (African Sightings Continued) while it moved around a small hill and took off parallel to the road. The object was quite brilliant, and appeared elongated rather than round. It was in two sections: a small front and a larger rear. There was a droning noise associated with it. It eventually disappeared in the distance. Mrs. Charles Morris is Mr. Burl's eldest daughter!

Maccabce MUFON State Director for Maryland (Copyright Bruce S. Maccabee, 1977) NOTE: The preceding installment (issue No. 123, February) was accidentally labelled \"Part 3\" instead of \"Part 4.\" Green Fireballs, from sources other than the FBI file we know that by the fall of 1947 the Air Force Intelligence had decided that \"flying discs\" were real objects. 10 * 52 Later, in the summer of 1948 a dominant feeling of the intelligence group working on the UFO reports was that they were extraterrestrial. This caused them to write the \"legendary\" estimate of the situation mentioned by Ruppelt 10 * 21 in which they argued that the discs were extraterrestrial. When this \"estimate\" met with disfavor at the hands of Gen. Vandenburg, the intelligence group began to tend toward explaining things away in any manner possible. Also, as a result of the standard military procedure of transferring officers from place to place, and because of natural attrition involving tours of duty, the personnel in the intelligence group began to change considerably. The new personnel were apparently not as impressed with the reports obtained in 1947 and 1948, and so were not as likely to accept new reports as accurate descriptions of real phenomena. Thus they found it easier to explain reports by ignoring certain aspects of them and by stretching mundane explanations (e.g., balloons, birds, etc.) to the limit of their credibility. Consequently, by the end of 1948 the idea that disc reports might be a manifestation of a truly new phenomenon was in disfavor, and investigations of such reports were handled in a very low-key manner. However, in December of 1948 green fireballs began \"threatening\" certain highly restricted areas in the southwestern United States. Reports of these fireballs were made by many credible individuals, so by the end of December, it was clear that a real phenomenon was being observed. The intelligence group that had been investigating flying discs was now given another job: to find out what the green fireballs were and why they seemed to be concentrated over certain areas. Moreover, the FBI was brought back into the picture because of their interest in the protection of vital installations. The story of the fireball investigations (Project Grudge and Project Twinkle) can be found in detail else- where. 53 ' M > 55 > M I will present here information received by the FBI which indicates how the AF \"felt\" about these phenomena. The first document relating to the green fireballs is dated January 31, 1947, and it was filed under the heading \"Protection of Vital Installations, Bureau File #65-58300.\" Because it provides a good overview of the green fireball-disc situation through January 1947, I will reproduce it in full: \"At recent Weekly Intelligence Conferences of G-2, ONI, OSI, and F.B.I., in the Fourth Army Area, Officers of G-2, Fourth Army have discussed the matter of 'Unidentified Aircraft' or 'Unidentified Aerial Phenomena' otherwise known as 'Flying Discs', 'Flying Saucers' and 'Balls of Fire'. This matter is considered top secret by Intelligence Officers of both the Army and the Air Forces. (Note: This sentence was underlined in the original copy by the FBI agent who wrote it.) \"It is well known that there have been during the past two years reports from the various parts of the country of the sighting of unidentified aerial objects which have been called in newspaper parlance 'flying discs' and 'flying saucers'. The first such reported from Sweden, and it was thought that the objects, the nature of which was unknown, might have originated in Russia. \"In July 1948 an unidentified aircraft was 'seen' by an Eastern Airlines Pilot and Co-Pilot and one or more passengers of the Eastern Airlines plane over Montogomery, Alabama (Note: Chiles-Whitted case, July 24, 1948). This aircraft was reported to be of unconventional type without wings and resembled generally a 'rocket ship' of the type depicted in comic strips. It was reported to have had windows: to have been larger than the Eastern Airlines plane, and to have been traveling at an estimated speed of 2700 miles an hour. It appeared out of a thunderhead ahead of the Eastern Airlines plane and immediately disappeared in another cloud narrowly missing a collision with the Eastern Airlines plane. No sound or air disturbance was noted in connection with this appearance. \"During the past two months various sightings of unexplained phenomena have been reported in the vicinity of the A.E.C. Installation at Los Alamos, New Mexico, where these phenomena now appear to be concentrated. During December 1948 on the 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th, llth, 13th, 14th, 20th and 28th sightings of unexplained phenomena were made near Los Alamos by Special Agents of the Office of Special Investigation: Airline Pilots; Military Pilots; Los Alamos Security Inspectors, and private citizens. On January 6, 1949, another similar object was sighted in the same area. \"Dr. Lincoln La Paz, a Meteorologist (sic) of some note, has 7 (continued on nexf page)"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"(FBI Files, continued) been generally in charge of the observations near Los Alamos, attempting to learn characteristics of the unexplained phenomena. Up to this time little concrete information has been obtained. There have been day time sightings which are tentatively considered to possibly resemble the exhaust of some type of jet propelled object. Night-time sightings have taken the form of lights usually described as brilliant green, similar to a green traffic signal or green neon light. Some reports indicated that the light began and ended with a red or orange flash. Other reports have given the color as red, white, blu-white (sic), and yellowish green. Trailing lights sometimes observed are said to be red. The spectrum analysis of one light indicates that it may be a copper compound of the type known to be used in rocket experiments and which completely disintegrates upon explosion, leaving no debris. It is noted that no debris has ever been known to be located anywhere resulting from the unexplained phenomena. \"Recent observations have indicated that the unidentified phenomena travel at a rate of speed estimated at a minimum of three miles per second and a maximum of twelve miles per second, or a mean calculated speed of seven and one-half miles a second, or 27,000 miles an hour. Their reported course indicates that they travel on an East-West line with probability that they approach from the Northern quadrant, which would be the last stage of the great circle route if they originated in Russia. (Note: compare this with the information supplied to the Stamford, Conn., office about the possibility of orbiting atomic bombs in 1947 presented earlier.) When observed they seem to be in level flight at a height of six to ten miles and thus traveling on a tangent to the earth's surface. They occasionally dip at the end of the path and on two occasions a definite vertical change in path was indicated. These phenomena have not 8 been known to have been sighted, however, at any intermediate point between Russia and Los Alamos, but only at the end of the flight toward the apparent 'target', namely, Los Alamos. \"In every case but one the shape of the objects has been reported as round in a point of light with a definite area to the light's source. One report gives a diamond shape; another indicated that trailing lights are elongated. The size is usually compared to one-fourth the diameter of the full moon, and they have also been compared in size to a basketball with trailing lights the size of a baseball. On no occasion has sound been associated directly with the phenomena, but unexplained sounds have been reported from Los Alamos. On two occasions reports have been received of the sighting of multiple units. Some nine scientific reasons are stated to . exist which indicated that the phenomena observed are not due to meteorites (sic). The only conclusions reached thus far are that they are either hitherto unobserved natural phenomena or that they are man made. No scientific experiments are known to exist in this country which could give rise to such phenomena.\" About two months later, the FBI headquarters received further information about the status of the fireball investigation. 58 In this report the FBI agent reemphasized the secret classification and pointed out that \"G-2, 4th. Army, has now advised that the above matter is now termed 'Unconventional Aircraft' and investigations concerning such matters have been given the name 'Project Grudge'.\" The report mentioned that the USAF Air Materiel Command had the primary responsibility for investigating the \"Green fireball phenomena\" and that \"since December 5,1948 there have been more than ten incidents analogous to the 'green fireballs' described above and some twenty others with miner (sic) deviations, from the above. It is also pointed out that the only sitings (sic) which had occurred seemed to have been confined to the Los Alamos, Las Vegas, and West Texas Triangle.\" The report stated that on November 1, 1948, higher Military authorities claimed that the Air Force advised that sightings occurred periodically and that \"another period of sitings (sic) was then imminent.\" On February 14, 1949, \"higher military authorities advised that it was believed that ultimately it would be found that the phenomena in question have a natural explanation.\" The report also mentioned some sightings around Camp Hood, Texas, in early March and stated \"There appears to be reason to believe that the above-mentioned phenomena (i.e., \"flares\" near Camp Hood) may be connected with secret experiments being conducted by some U.S. Government Agency as it is believed that the United States is farther advanced in guided missile development than any foreign power.\" It is interesting to note the reappearance of the \"secret U.S. device\" as an explanation that might appeal to the intelligence community. This suggests that there was no doubt that the phenomena were real, and therefore the intelligence community, or at least part of it, felt the objects must be man-made. FBI Policy Restated. The upsurge in AF interest in unidentified aerial phenomena in late 1948 and early 1949 resulted in a re-statement of the earlier policy by the FBI. The policy after October 1, 1947, was set by bulletin #57 of that year: \"All future reports connected with flying discs should be referred to the Air Forces and no investigative action should be taken by Bureau agents.\" The lack of UFO reports during late 1947 and throughout 1948 (there was one good report in 1948 in the section of the file that I have) indicates that the FBI agents were following instructions very well. Early in 1949 it became clear to the FBI that the Air Force was taking reports of anomalous phenomena seriously, as was indicated by the. publication of a document dated"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"February 15, 1949 and entitled \"Air Intelligence Requirements Memoran- dum Number 4\" which was signed by General C.P. Cabell, Major General, USAF, Director of Intelligence, Office of the Deputy Chief of Staff, Operations. This document was a prototype sighting form which had a twofold purpose: (a) to enunciate continuing Air Force requirements for information pertaining to sightings of unconventional aircraft and unidentified flying objects, including the so-called \"flying discs\" and (b) to establish procedures for reporting such information. Any information obtained was to be submitted on AF form 112 (a sighting form) which could be filled out by the observer. The Requirements Memoran- dum, which was marked restricted, was apparently to be filled out by the person interviewing the witness (i.e., by an agent of the Air Force, FBI, CIA, or whatever) and, along with the usual questions about time, location, directions and duration of sighting, appearance, etc., it included questions that would pertain to details about aircraft (wings, aerodynamic list of fuselage, type of propulsion, visible exhaust, existence and location of stabilizers, air ducts, slots, etc.) and questions that pertained to the observer (hobbies; ability to determine speed, color, angular size; reliability as determined by acquaintances, police and FBI records, and the employer). This memorandum was circulated to the Commanding Generals of the Major Air Commands throughout the world, all U.S. Air Attaches, the Director of the CIA, Special Assistant for Research and Intelligence of the Department of State, Director of Intelligence of GSUSA, the Chief of Naval Intelligence, the Commandant of the U.S. Coast Guard, and the Director of the FBI. The receipt of this memorandum, plus the confidential information from the Resident Engineer at Oak Ridge referred to in a previous section of these papers, plus the green fireball flap, resulted in the following memorandum from Mr. Fletcher to Mr. Ladd converning \"FLYING DISCS\" (March 14, 1949): 5 ' \"The approval of the Executives Conference is requested for the attached SAC letter furnishing to the field the type of information desired by the Intelligence Division of the Air Force in connection with the captioned matter (flying discs). You will recall that by Bulletin #57, Series 1947, dated October 1,1947, the field was advised that effective as of that date the Bureau had discontinued its investigative activities in connection with flying discs. The field was advised that all future reports concerning this matter received in the field should be referred to the Air Forces. \"Mr. E., (name crossed off) Resident Engineer, Air Materiel Command, Nuclear Energy for the Propulsion of Aircraft Research (Note: Project NEPA), Oak Ridge, Tennessee, has recently and confidentially advised the Bureau that flying discs are believed by the Air Force to be man-made missiles rather than some natural phenomenon and that as much as four years ago it was learned that some type of flying discs were being experimented upon by the Russians. It was further determined from Mr. E. that most all of the flying discs seen by persons in the United States approached this country from a northerly direction and returned in the same direction, indicating the strong possibility that they are coming from Russia. \"The Department of the Air Force has furnished to the Bureau a sufficient number of copies of a memorandum dated February 15,1949 captioned \"Unconventional Aircraft\" which can be furnished to our field offices. At the present time this Bureau is conducting no investigation of information received in the field relating to the captioned matter. It is recommended that the attached SAC letter and enclosure be forwarded to the field to advise them of the type of questions to be asked of persons who voluntarily (underlining by present author) submit information relative to 'flying discs'. Although no active investigation will be conducted by the Bureau, it is believed that the captioned matter is of sufficient importance to the internal security of the country that our field offices should secure as much information as possible from complainants in order to assist the Department of the Air Force.\" The attached letter to Special Agents in Charge (SAC) was accepted and published as SAC Letter #38 on March 25, 2959. The letter read as follows:\" \"Your attention is directed to Bureau Bulletin #57, Series 1947, dated October 1, 1947, relating to the discontinuance of investigation by this Bureau in matters concerning flying discs. For your confidential information, a reliable and confidential source has advised the Bureau that flying discs are believed to be man- made missiles rather than natural phenomenon. It has also been determined that for approximately the past four years the USSR has been engages in experimentation on an unknown type of flying disc. The Department of the Air Force has furnished to the Bureau the attached memorandum classified \"restricted\" dated February 15, 1949, entitled \"Unconventional Aircraft\". This memorandum is being furnished to you in order that all agents assigned to your office can be informed of the type of information desired by the Air Force in this matter. \"As set forth in Bureau Bulletin #57, referred to above, no investigation should be conducted by your office relative to flying discs, however, the attached memorandum should be referred to in securing data from persons who desire to voluntarily furnish information to your office relating to flying discs, (signed, John Edgar Hoover, Director).\" This letter, which was referred to several times in later years, forms the basic core of FBI policy: don't go out and try to obtain UFO information, but if someone volunteers it, here are the 9 (continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"(FBI Files Continued) questions you should ask. It is interesting that the information furnished by the Resident Engineer (the confidential source) was used as the justification for this letter. The Resident engineer had himself admitted that he was not directly involved with the A.F. UFO investigation, yet he was considered to be an authority. 1949 UFO Cases in the FBI file. The next interoffice memorandum of interest in the portion I obtained was written in March 1950. Therefore, to maintain the historical order of presentation, I will turn from the collection of memoranda to the collection of good UFO cases once again. As pointed out before, 1948 was a dry year for UFO cases as far as the FBI was concerned. (According to Project Blue Book Special Report #14 the Air Force received 205 reports caused by an estimated 143 objects; some were foreign reports. This number of reports can be compared with 117 in 1947, 395 in 1949 and 306 in 1950, some of which were from foreign sources.) However, in 1949 things picked up again. Perhaps the FBI agents forgot they were supposed to keep out of the UFO business. In January and in March the FBI received brief reports of bright objects over Kirtland AFB near Albuquerque, N.M., and at the Killeen Base near Camp Hood, Texas. These reports were not investigated by the FBI. A report which was investigated will now be presented. On May 3, 1949, J.E. Hoover received a letter from the Special Agent in Charge (SAC) at Los Angeles which stated: 61 \"A reliable and confidential source has recently advised this Bureau that during the first part of April, 1949 (name blanked out) Hollywood 27, California, had informed him that three employees of the Department of Recreation in Parks in the city of Los Angeles had noticed objects in the sky which appeared to be flying discs. The above information is being furnished to you for whatever 10 action you desire and no investigation is being conducted relative thereto by this Bureau. \"Although the SAC did not investigate this case he apparently took more than just a passing interest in the next case in the FBI file, for he wrote about it to headquarters on May 13, 1949. This letter also indicates that the FBI was \"plugged into\" the news media. The letter follows: 62 \"On May 5, 1949, Mr a .eporter for the Sun-Star newspaper, Merced, Cal., advised Special Agent.... (call him SA) that his paper had been contacted by Lt. Col Intelligence Officer, Castle Air Force Base, Merced, Calif., relative to any reports that the newspaper might have received concerning \"flying discs\" in the Merced vicinity. Mr stated a close friend of his, one 12-A Langdon Villa, Merced, had advised him that he had observed a strange object, and as he is in the Air Corps Reserve, he reported same to the Intelligence Officer at Castle Field. \"On the same date Mr Detachment Commander, Office of Special Investigations, Castle Air Force Base, Merced, Cal. advised SA that he had heard that an individual had reported seeing a \"flying disc\" to the Intelligence Officer at the Base but that the Intelligence Officer had not furnished the information to him. Mr later on the same date contacted SA and exhibited a letter written by Lt. Col., USAF, Adjutant (Intelligence Officer) to Commanding General, Air Material (sic) Command, Wright-Patterson AFB, Wright Field, Ohio. This letter contained a statement given by Mr (the witness who was a friend of the newspaper reporter and who was in the Air Corps Reserve)...which read as follows: 'I had occasion to step from my home, located approximately one mile west of the town of Merced, on the night of April 4, 1949, at approximately 2220 (i.e., 10:20 P.M.). My attention was diverted to a clicking noise of considerable intensity. I stopped on the sidewalk about 20 feet from the front steps and recognized the source of this clicking to be in the sky in an area about 40 degrees from the surface of the earth in an easterly direction. The sky condition was 20000 thin broken (i.e., thin clouds at about 20,000 feet) with 12 miles visibility and surface winds were reported as north nine M.P.H. at Castle Air Force Weather Station. My home is approximately seven miles south of Castle AFB and in an area somewhat sheltered from surface winds, and no appreciable surface wind was apparent at the time the aural observation was made. After about ten seconds of looking into the area described previously as being the source of this sound, an object was observed blanking out stars in describing a flight path in a west or northwesterly direction. Only one object was apparent, its shape can be described as only a solid mass. Its size can be estimated as four or five feet in diameter in keeping with an estimated altitude of considerably less than 1000 feet. Color was shown by the reflection of ground lights on only two occasions, and it appeared to be dull surfaced, light colored metal. The only ground lights of intensity were a row of street lights behind me one half block which leads me to believe the under surface of this object to be curved in shape. 'This object when first sighted, was moving very slowly in a west or northwesterly direction. I would estimate that I had it in my range of vision for 35 seconds, after having heard it about ten seconds before locating it. It passed on beyond the house and maneuvered through an arc of turn to the left of about ninety degrees. The clicking sound was continuous throughout this rum, however, it became louder as it returned on its new heading of south or southwest. On its return the clicking sound became louder, but I was unable to see at this time. The clicking stopped when it was at its greatest intensity and appeared to come from a position directly over head. I was unable to see the object after the sound stopped. 'This clicking sound retained the same pitch and speed throughout the"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"entire course observed, but intensity varied. There was no whistle or roar, but only the clicking noise which might be compared to beaters of a home mixer that were not properly meshed. No lights or flame were observed during the entire course with exception of the previous described reflections twice. No exhaust trail was distinguishable. My dog was with me and directed her attention in the general direction of this object's flight throughout its course. She had been romping with me on coming out of the house but without spoken word stopped and directed her attention on to (sic) the previously described area. The clicking sound might not have been unusual to the dog, but there is a possibility of sounds on wave lengths discernable only to the dog being emitted.' (Note: this ends the report of the sighting.) \"It is to be noted that (the witness) is a member of the Active USAF Reserve with the rank of Major. He had attained rating of pilot in August 1941 and has approximately 2200 hours flying time. During his active duty period in WW2 he stated that he had considerable night flying experience in connection with his military assignment. The Intelligence Officer in the above mentioned letter made the foDowing statement. 'An attempt to locate other witnesses in the area or through the local newspaper proved unsuccessful.' \"The above is being furnished for the information of the Bureau.\" The preceding report, which is listed as unidentified in the Air Force file, has been presented in full because of the interesting details (clicking, animal reaction) and also because it indicates that FBI agents were interested in UFO reports and obtained information for the FBI in spite of Hoover's order to avoid UFO investigations. Other 1949 cases are as follows: • Teletype report of sightings from Ogden, Logan, and Trenton, Utah; April 5, 1949; initially identified by the Office of Special Investigations (OSI) as practice bombing missions. • Letter from SAC, Little Rock, which shows that the FBI agent interviewed a Ft. Smith, Arkansas, resident about a sighting made while the observer was stopped at an intersection on April 16, 1949. The SAC letter to the FBI headquarters stated that \"the offices of OSI and MID have been notified....\". • A letter with newspaper clippings enclosed concerning \"what has been described as a flying disc sighted at Radford, Virginia, on May 12,1949.\" The FBI agent made it clear in his letter that he had not talked to any of the witnesses. • A letter from SAC, New Orleans, which informed the Bureau that the Office of Naval Intelligence had received reports of \"single discs\" which had been seen travelling over New Orleans on May 18,19, and 23. The Navy informed the Bureau that Army Intelligence had investigated these cases (which, however, are in the Air Force file). • A copy of the official Navy report made by Lt. Shell of a sighting of several \"discs\" while flying in an airplane in southern Oregon on May 27. For part of the time the objects were at a lower altitude than he and he could see them \"outlined against the bluffs\" which were about 10 miles away. The Air Force left this case unidentified. • A teletype referring to a sighting made in Canada which was reported to the Air Force in Nebraska. The last 1949 case in the portion of the FBI file that I have concerns a pilot sighting in West Virginia. The FBI document contains a letter to the OSI with a summary of this case, but, since it is not listed in the \"table of contents\" of the Project Blue Book microfilm record, it may never have reached the appropriate Air Force authorities. Since, therefore, it may not be available in any collection of cases, I am presenting it here in full. According to the cover letter from the FBI agent who received the • information, Mr. ...(name crossed off) gave a letter to the resident agent at Charleston, West Virginia. \"Mr stated that after writing the letter, he did not know whether it would be of any interest to the FBI and decided that instead of mailing it directly to the Bureau at Washington, he would contact the local agent and turn it over to him if it were thought it would be of interest to the Bureau. Mr stated that he has set out the complete details of this incident in his letter and that there is nothing further that he can add. He further stated that he is certain this was not a mirage and that it actually occurred. No further action is being taken by this office unless specified to do so by the Bureau.\" The letter from Mr is as follows: \"An incident happened this afternoon (9/25/49) which after consideration I felt I should report. I most certainly do not want this incident disclosed, as I do not want any publicity concerning it. If you regard it of no special interest to the F.B.I, please disregard this correspondence. I was flying from Clark Field to Parkersburg, W.Va. this afternoon and about four miles airline, southwest of Parkersburg I suddenly noticed a bright yellow object coming directly toward me. It came at me with such speed, added to my 100 nxp.h. forward speed that it startled me and had passed by in a matter of a couple of seconds. But it passed by about 100 feet under my ship and about 50 feet to my right, and because of the dark green background of the forests below I was able to get a very clear outline of the object, and (Continued on page 15) 11"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"I\" By Ann Druffcl At 1:22 AM on'the morning of March 6, 1977, Douglas Kriese, a security guard in Sylmar, called SKYNET. He had been referred by the Van Nuys Police Emergency Board. Mr. Kriese was wide awake (which I was hot). As his excited voice described an apple-red UFO which had landed in a field near his security booth, I managed to pull myself awake and pay attention. The object had come down out of the west over some low hills, Kriese stated. He had watched it for several minutes. Awed by the sight, he had managed to come back to his booth and phone the police, in the hope of getting additional witnesses before the object decided to leave. Since a UFO landing does not fall within a policeman's notion of \"safeguarding the public safety,\" he had been referred to SKYNET. As Kriese talked, he explained he could not see the object from his booth, since large buildings were between him and the adjacent field where the object had perched. I asked him to check and see if it was still there. He returned within a couple of minutes and told me excitedly the object was no longer there. He couldn't figure out how it had left without his seeing it. Also, another guard, employed by the same private security patrol was with him having stopped by for a regular check- in. I suggested he go with his buddy to see if the object had left imprints or other traces. Shortly afterward, Kriese called back, rather breathlessly. He and his buddy had found a circular place in the field where the weeds were sparse and mashed down. It is necessary to interject there that landing reports are uncommon in the Los Angeles area, and even in those rare cases where a UFO deigns to sit upon our local earth, it almost always 12 displays a maddening penchant for leaving no traces whatsoever. Therefore, on the strength of Kriese's statements and his seeming reliability, I contacted Morrey Allen, another MUFON investigator. We met at the site of the reported landing at approximately 3:00 AM. By the light of flashlights and a westerly moon, we poked among the ankle-high mustard weeds which grew lushly in the large, flat field east of the glass manufacturing plant which Kriese was guarding. His buddy was not available for interviews, having been called away on his regular guard-duty rounds. We made a careful survey of the \"landing site\" and at the same time an hour-long interview with the witness was recorded. The site was about 200 feet north of a low, sloping hill, part of a system of hills which climb up into the Little Tujunga Canyon area. The affected patch was roughly 15 feet in diameter, and within its irregular perimeter were crushed mustard weed. There were no marks of landing gear, no residue traces, burned patches, etc. On the southern portion of the \"landing spot\" were footprints which matched the distinctive sole of Kriese's boots. He stated that he had, indeed, stepped over the perimeter at that point. Other partial footprints of the same type were found on the eastern section of the site, but Kriese denied having walked in that area, since I had warned him over the phone not to disturb the spot in any way. There was some evidence that a rock and clumps of dried, surface soil had been scuffed around, but there was nothing which would suggest that a blast of air, propulsion gases, or anything had disturbed the earth. The landing site did not fall into the category of a first-rate trace case, but as I have said before, in the Los Angeles Basin area we take what we can get. Kriese seemed to be a reliable, balanced individual. He was 18 years old and had been a security guard for about three months. He had a high- school education, was well-spoken, and it did not seem that the incident was a hoax or a mistaken identification of any kind. When the object was first seen, Kriese stated, it was 1:05 AM. The apparent size was that of a full moon, and it glowed red-orange as it dropped steeply down out of the sky over the low hill to the southeast. He lost sight of it temporarily as it disappeared behind one of the plant's large buildings. Since it seemed to be on a landing trajectory, Kriese walked south through the plant property. Through an opening between buildings, he saw the object sitting on, or hovering close to, the field, about 300 feet from his vantage point. He did not approach it closer. He felt frightened. He could discern a low-pitched hum with an accompanying sensation of warmth. He stared at it for about 5 minutes. In this aspect, the object was \"apple-colored\" or dark reddish- orange. It was dimly lit by a dull glow, which wavered in a peculiar manner which Kriese had trouble describing. The bottom, colored portion was roughly the proportions of a \"tuna can,\" and reflected its dark glow over the adjacent landscape. On top of the \"tuna can\" was a high, transparent dome, made visible by the light of the bright moon. Through the glass-like dome, the landscape showed clearly. Investigator Allen returned to the site of the alleged landing the next morning and photographed the circular patch, the battered weeds, and the footprints. In the meantime I had, with great difficulty, located a geiger counter at a local university, and Ron Olch and Allen checked for radiation at the site. Readings were background level, normal. We gradually became convinced that the \"landing spot\" was nothing more than a natural, bare place in the"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"(California Report, Continued) A/ r cj&y wii^'-*'i Sketch by Douglas Kriese field and that Kriese and his buddy had somehow mashed the sparse weed in that area in their search for the place where Kriese had seen the object land. We felt it was possible that the young guard had, indeed, witnessed the near approach of an apple-red UFO, as described, but failing to find definite marks or imprints which could prove his story, might have manufactured his own \"traces\". However, Allen did find an L- shaped swath of wilted vegetation, mainly mustard weed, which seemed to cut a fifty-foot path northward from the bottom of the low hill over which the UFO had reportedly flown in its approach toward the field. The swath was in line with the location where Kriese saw the object stationary in the field. Most important, Kriese was not aware of this blighted section, and its presence seemed to indicate the possibility that an object, emitting something which would wilt vegetation, had indeed swooped down the hill very low to the ground. Samples were taken of the blighted vegetation within the swath. The weeds were brown and showed evidence of bad damage. I sent them to a Carbon-14 dating lab at a major university. (Readers will wonder at this point wny such action was taken. The presence of abnormal counts of Carbon-14 has never before, to my knowledge, come up in any investigation of UFO landing sites. Shortly before the Kriese sighting occurred, a qualified Carbon-14 dating researcher had offered help in any UFO landing case which might use these services. This researcher had suggested the following, seemingly original, idea. \"What I propose to do is compare the activity of the C-14 found in a standard to a sample exposed to a UFO. The underlying purpose of this is to detect the presence of a large thermal neutron discharge, that could possibly reflect the energy source of the craft. As in some . common nuclear energy generating modes, thermal neutrons...are given off in varying degrees. C14 is the result of the following reaction: [Chemical formula deleted here. Ed.] Unfortunately, N 14 is not a terribly good receptor of thermal neutrons, but if there are large amounts of this type of radiation a noticeable amount of C 14 might be produced. So, for the love of the unknown, let's give it a go!\" Would to God all scientists were as open-minded and helpful!) While the researcher's \"counters\" were clicking away in the carbon-dating lab, we continued exploring the alleged landing location: The entire area including hill and blighted swath were photographed and sketched, and the results were compared with a topographical map obtained from the U.S. Geological Survey. About 3 miles due north of the place where the object reportedly landed is Lopez dam, an irregularly- shaped water reservoir about % mile in length. About 2% miles to the southeast lies the giant Hansen Dam flood control basin. About 1/3 mile to the southwest is San Fernando Airport. The incident had occurred at the edge of the populated section of Sylmar. The only residences within a mile on any side (except for the manufacturing plant) is a trailer park, but this does not 13 (continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"(California Report, Continued) overlook the place where Kriese saw the object land. Main power lines run parallel to FoothUl Blvd. (Grant Blvd.) midway between the airport and the manufacturing plant. If, indeed, the object reported by Kriese was a UFO, it had chosen a place perfectly suited for privacy, adjacent to the two earth resources seemingly sought by its kind — electricity and water. The area was thoroughly checked for additional witnesses to the sighting, but none could be located. However, a young boy who lived in the adjacent isolated hills remembered seeing a white object with a glowing red bottom traveling through daytime skies over the area a few days before Kriese's sighting, and from the same field where the young guard had seen his object land. Significantly, this young witness made his report and sketch without ever knowing the shape of the object Kriese had described. (See two sketches accompanying this article.) Many dozens of hours were put in by the three investigators on this case. Several other researchers in the area contributed advice and consultation. In view of the contradictory evidence pro and con, was it merely an exercise in frustration? Was it all for nothing? The eagerly-awaited results from the carbon-dating lab finally arrived. The results of the carbon-14 counting process showed no distinctive numerical value, as compared to comparison samples tested. The results indicated there was no nuclear activity, especially in the form of neutrons in the immediate area of the blighted swath of vegetation. However, as our Carbon-14 researcher pointed out, this analysts does not in any way deny the fact that there was a true landing or close approach. It was merely an attempt to prove one of the many effects that might happen at a landing site. 14 Sketch by Joe C. Almost a week after the landing report, it was noticed that the vegetation in the wilted swath was reviving and, indeed, was fresher, bigger, and more lush than surrounding vegetation. Also at this point, Allen noticed that adjacent areas of vegetation now were becoming blighted. What this meant was unknown. Was it all a set of circumstances? Was the \"blight\" and regrowth merely part of the natural life cycle of mustard weed? As in so many other UFO cases, we are left with a dilemma. Was the object Doug Kriese reported a true UFO, making a landing for its own unknown purposes in an isolated section on the edge of Sylmar? Or was the entire incident a hoax or a mistake on his part? It is my measured opinion that something possibly was seen as reported, and that the object hovered or landed without leaving measurable traces. It is worth putting into the literature because the Kriese case points up an entirely new idea and scientific process which might add to our knowledge of UFOs in the future. Some landing traces involve material containing carbon — such as vegetation, tree limbs, and carcasses of animals. Carbonaceous material showing evidence of having been affected by a UFO could be tested for abnormal C-14 content according to the method described above. An abnormal C-14 count found in such materials could indicate the presence of a large thermal neutron discharge, which could possibly give some clue to the energy source of that particular UFO. In the field of UFO research, where nothing is certain, and almost nothing is known, we need all the help we can get. A CLOSE ENCOUNTER OF THE FIRST KIND By Slava Mach & Ross Redeker (MUFON Field Investigators) It was a warm spring evening of April 15,1975, when at exactly 9:23 PM Ed Handley looked up from his car which he was washing in his front yard driveway in San Jose, California. He was attracted by a light in the southwest sky, toward Los Gatos, that seemed familiar to him, so he thought at first the object was moving slowly across the darkening sky between himself and the Santa Clara Valley foothills, perpendicular to his line of sight. He thought it was a Navy P2 Orion from its slow speed and bright light. Suddenly, it turned at a right angle and headed straight towards him. He was really scared by its protruding beam of light pointed toward him, as well as the ever growing realization that this was really not an airplane at all! Finally, after 10 to 11 minutes of continuous slow motion it stopped"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"(Close Encounter, Continued) directly over the street in front of his house. He was so excited by then that he dashed into his house to grab his binoculars, while at the same time yelling to his mother to come outside quickly. (Ed works as a science teacher in the San Jose Unified School District and previously did not believe in UFOs.) By the time he got outside again, the large object had moved slightly closer, now directly over his front lawn. By then a neighbor family of five were also outside gaping skyward. The object itself was estimated by Ed as about 90 feet in diameter, with a protruding cabin-like structure rising no more than 10 feet above the disc shape. Besides the one beam of light pointing out into the night, an orange glow was seen around the edges of the strange craft. Ed was by then passing his binoculars around to the excited group. What they saw is depicted in the accompanying illustration. (You might ask why he did not take a picture, but he simply stated his camera was out of film and was normally outfitted for daylight shots anyway.) In addition to the glowing disc, red spark-like material could be seen dropping off the underside of the craft, disappearing about 6 feet down, much like the dying embers of a July fourth skyrocket. But this particular brand of fireworks was absolutely silent! The perfectly white light beam, poking out from the UFO, moved up and down forming an arc on a circle with a small subtended angle. Finally, a little over 5 minutes after the close encounter began, the UFO started to oscillate: Then, within a very short time, it shot straight up — disappearing within a matter of seconds, last seen as a tiny starlike spot in the heavens. After catching his breath, Ed wanted to share his \"discovery\" with more than just his neighbors, so he tried to communicate with the press and the police first, but with little success. Both of these stalwart community agencies laughed at him, would not take him seriously, and even refused to take the information which he offered to give them. So, he went elsewhere, to the Alameda Naval Air Station, in the San Francisco Bay Area, but they claimed their radar was broken during the time of his sighting. After calling several other locations, such as Vandenburg AFB, Ed just gave up. Finally, there were no physical or emotional effects on either himself or the 6 other witnesses and no evidence, left at the site — truly a close encounter of the first kind. (Editor's note: This story would still be buried in Ed's mind but for Dr. J. Allen Hynek's guest lecture on UFOs at the University of Santa Clara, January 11, 1978. During the question and answer period, Ed came forward and (Continued on page 19) : (FBI Files, Continued) what I believe is a very accurate description. Color - bright canary yellow Length - about 15 to 18 inches Diameter - about 4\" in the largest part It resembled a rocket, in fact was about the same shape and proportions as the fuselage of a Lockheed Air Force X-90. No 'wings but vertical and horizontal fins on rear 1/3 of the rocket. No visible means of propulsion such as propellor, vapor trail, smoke or exhaust. The front of the rocket was very sharp with a needle nose, the needle looked about 6\" long and was the size of a lead pencil. The rear end was blunt similar to the rear end of a jet fuselage. I was flying my ship, a Luscombe 8A, NC 144OK, and was traveling about 100 m.p.h. at the time. I was flying at 3450 ft. above sea level at the time. I was flying a compass course of 60 degrees, and the rocket was traveling almost west at 240 degrees. It happened at 2:45 P.M. on the above date. The visibility was exceptionally good, about 30 miles. The yellow object looked very sharp and clearly outlined because of the dark green background. If you will refer to the Huntington sectional aerial map this object was sighted over a very small town named Lubeck, which is about 4 miles direct (sic) west of South Parkersburg. It appeared to have spent its force and seemed to be dropping slightly as it passed by, or had been fired or launched from a higher altitude than the altitude I was flying. My wife was with me but she did not see the object, and I did not tell her of the incident until we landed at Parkersburg.\" The next report in the FBI files is an official Navy document concerning several sightings in Kodiak, Alaska in January 1950. One of these was a radar- visual sighting.

A sighting of special interest occurred on September 17-18, 1977 at 12:15 AM when an 18-year-old woman, Wendy Lovejoy, watched a UFO of unusual configuration following her car for about 2 minutes. Miss Lovejoy was driving northeast along Rongotea Road toward the township of the same name when she noticed the object shining in her rear view mirror and continued driving, afraid to stop. The object was a double triangle with curved apexes intersecting each other (see witness* sketch). 1 The interiors of the triangles were dark, but the edges were glowing bright orange. \"It would move slowly from left and then to the right. The frames of the triangles would sparkle like something does when it gets an electric shock,\" stated Miss Lovejoy. It disappeared from view after 2 minutes as she approached Rongotea township. She did not see the manner of its disappearance. She returned her eyes to the road momentarily, and when she glanced back again for the fourth time it was gone. Harold Fulton, who conducted an intense investigation into the case, was impressed with the good sense and coolness displayed by the witness. Although she was somewhat frightened by the odd object, she continued driving, meanwhile trying to determine what it was. \"I thought of some electrical fault in the car somewhere or maybe a reflection, but the car was still running normally, the dash gauges were operating as normal , and so no reflection was produced from the car. I slowed down the car...to get a good look at it because the object was so simple, clear, bright and close,\" she wrote on her MUFON sighting form. She estimated the UFO was only about 20 feet from the rear of her car at its closest point. 2 Upon arriving at Rongotea, she examined the car carefully, but could see no effects from the close encounter. However, she herself felt \"unwell\" for two days afterward, possibly a result of shock and excitement.

The clearcut shape and clouded sky preclude any astronomical interpre- tation. Also, in Mr. Fulton's opinion, no other ordinary explanation seems tenable. Although this is a one-witness sighting, possible corroboration exists in an earlier sighting on September 17th, when a Palmerston North motorcyclist, Mark Kennard, spotted an orange-colored object above Manawatu at 10:00 PM. He watched it for about 10 seconds before losing sight of it as he traveled on his cycle. He could not determine if the object was moving or stationary. It was apparently too far away from the witness for him to notice any definite shape, but he described it as definitely ususual. A possibly important aspect of the Lovejoy sighting is pointed up by Fulton. Miss Lovejoy had sighted the UFO only 4 miles from unusual power like breaks on Kellows Line in January 1977. Three copper unsheathed power lines had apparently been stretch- broken simultaneously, and despite 18 investigation by authorities the incident was never satisfactorily explained. Fulton pointed out that 11,000 volt power feeder lines have a T- Junction at the Hammonds-Rongotea Road intersection. Earlier on September 17, at 7:56 AM, a 50-year-old man and a neighbor woman viewed a red object which seemed to be about a mile away, over the dune country north of the Manawatu river-mouth. It \"poised\" for 7 full minutes, stationary and silent. The witnesses thought at first it might be a helicopter, but discarded the explanation due to a lack of engine noise and also because helicopters do not normally fly in that area after dark. Fulton also reports on a brilliant \"hot-blue\" glowing object seen by five members of a family traveling by car on September 7,1977. The witnesses were driving south of Havelock North at about 9:40 PM when they viewed an elongated, solid-appearing object moving in the sky parallel to the road. A brilliant concentration of hot-bluish light from the leading edge seemed to reflect off the rest of the body. The definite cigar-like shape could be seen at times through the glow. (See witnesses' sketch) Fhe object was traveling the same direction as the car, on the right- hand side. It was viewed for 5 to 8 minutes. At one point the driver of the car stopped the vehicle and turned the motor off, but no noise could be detected from the object. No interference with headlights, etc., was noticed. The object continued its southerly flight at a constant speed, and the driver restarted the car and continued driving. At all times the object was viewed at about 35 degree elevation. No apparent size or estimated distance was given for the object, but it burned brightly and clearly. One of the family stated, \"It reminded me of a magnesium strip burning closeup.\" 1. Fulton writes, \"I seem to recall a sighting in the past of somewhat similar configuration, but cannot place it at present.\" 2. Since the object paced the car so closely, we might wonder why no interference with the engine, headlights, etc. occurred. James McCampbell has cited recent research which indicates that electrical interference with motor vehicles seems to occur only when the UFO is directly in front of or very near the engine. Was Miss Lovejoy driving a front-engine car? (AD)"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"Lucius Parish In Others' Words An Italian case involving seven witnesses to a landed UFO and occupant is featured in the February 21 issue of NATIONAL ENQUIRER. According to the witnesses' testimony, the being seemed to be attempting communication with them via a code- like rhythm of its orange-flashing \"eyes.\" An extremely interesting claim. The February 28 ENQUIRER reported on UFO sightings along a beach in Puerto Rico, where objects allegedly entered and left the water several times. Despite the Air Force's \"Official position\" on UFOs, the Air Force Academy library has one of the largest collections of UFO books, according to an article in the March 14 ENQUIRER. UFO research groups are vying for federal funds for continued (and improved) investigations, according to the February 14 issue of THE STAR. With NASA bowing out of the UFO picture and with no public governmental investigations being conducted, the UFO organizations feel they should be given government funds if they are to make any headway. Perhaps, but this is another of those \"don't hold your breath until...\" situations! Melinda Dillon, co-star of \"Close Encounters of the Third Kind,\" tells of her own UFO sighting at her home in Malibu, California, in the February 21 issue of THE STAR. The March 7 issue presents the predictions of ten psychics, all of whom predict a new wave of UFO events in 1978. Ho hum! The April issue of FATE contains Part 1 of Ann Druffel's very interesting article on a UFO witness who suffered a strange disease following his \"close encounters\" with UFOs and their occupants. Part 2 will be in the May issue. One of the newsstand publications on UFOs, ARGOSY UFO, is now defunct. The publishing schedule had recently been changed to bi-annually, due to poor sales figures. ARGOSY UFO carried some good material in some of its issues, so it is unfortunate that it is ceasing publication. As a contributor to the magazine on a couple of occasions, I could say nothing favorable about their payment policies, but on comparing the contents of their issues with the garbage being published by some of the other magazines, their demise represents a loss to UFO literature in general. While it is usually not my function to review films or TV programs, I think perhaps a few words about the new TV series, \"Project U.F.O.,\" are in order. I was not very impressed with the first episode, as the Air Force \"explanations\" were too much in evidence. Also, the elements of various cases are so thoroughly mixed together that no single UFO incident is recognizable. But, perhaps the most unacceptable aspect of the series is the totally false impression that the Blue Book personnel performed their jobs in a thorough and competent manner. That suggestion alone would place \"Project U.F.O.\" in the science-fiction category! Even so, despite my complaints, the program is not all bad. The second episode showed promise, so perhaps some good will come from the concept of having UFO cases (even dramatized ones) on prime-time TV. Two recent hardcover books for juvenile readers are THOSE MYSTERIOUS UFOs by David C. Knight (Parents' Magazine Press/52 Vanderbilt Ave./New York, NY 10017; price not given) and UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS by Jim Collins (Raintree Publishers Ltd./205 West Highland Avenue/Milwaukee, WI 53202; $6.60). Both books present summaries of the UFO subject and both are well illustrated with photos and drawings. Recent paperbacks include: UFOs AND ANTI-GRAVITY by Bruce L. Cathie and Peter N. Temm (Stackpole Books/Cameron & Kelker Streets/Harrisburg, PA 17105; $6.95); THE WALTON EXPERIENCE by Travis Walton (Berkley Publishing Corp./200 Madison Ave./New York, NY 10016; $1.95); THE SPACE-GODS REVEALED by Ronald Story (Harper & Row/10 East 53rd st./New York, NY 10022; $1.75); ALIEN MEETINGS by Brad Stei^er (Ace Books/1120 Avenue of the Americas/New York, NY 10036; $1.95). The Cathie and Temm book is the American edition of HARMONIC 695, presenting Cathie's theories of a world-wide \"power grid\" being used by UFOs. (Close Encounter, from p. 16) recounted the brief version of his sighting. Following the meeting MUFON immediately made contact, resulting in this story, derived from a 2 hour taped interview.) 19"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"DIRECTOR'S MESSAGE by Walt Andrus \"If you have a close encounter call the KONO *UFO hotline 226-UFOs. 24 hours a day, strictly confidential, all calls handed over to the Mutual UFO Network. Listen to KONO 860 (AM) for more details! *In cooperation with MUFON, Worldwide Mutual UFO Network\" This is the wording of a 6 x 10 inch illustrated ad in the April 11, 1978, issue of the San Antonio, Texas, News. This is in addition to five per day 3-minute commercials done in very good taste explaining close encounters of the first, second, third, and fourth kinds. It is treated as a public service announcement by the radio station, but in reality is a fantastic public relations and membership promotion for MUFON. Every hour a short announcement about the UFO Hotline is presented \"live\" by the announcer on duty. This type of enthusiasm has been generated by Bill Dante, Operations Manager for radio station KONO and MUFON's State Section Director for Bexar County. As the calls are recorded daily, they are transmitted to MUFON by Lee Woods for immediate investigation. Robert Morgan, Field Investigator in San Antonio, investigates the calls within Bexar County while the remainder in south Texas are checked out by MUFON from Seguin. As new State Section Directors for other south Texas counties are secured, they will share in these investigations. New State Section Directors appointed throughout the U.S.A. this past month are Daniel F. Palmieri, 58 Elm Street, Milford, NH 03055 for Hillsborough County, replacing \"Chip\" Hawyard. David R. Gwartney, P.O. Box 1613, Cody, Wyoming 82414 has volunteered to serve as State Section Director for Park County. David has been an amateur astronomer for twenty years. Forrest R. Lundberg and Gary Graber, Co-State Directors for Iowa, have selected Donald A. Curtis, 3039 Mahaska Avenue, Des Moines, Iowa 50317 to cover Polk and Warren counties to replace Dr. Desmond H. Bragg, whose added duties as a Department Head at Drake University have prevented him from devoting the time to UFO research which he felt it needed. Edwin E. Bailey, formerly State Section Director for Wayne and Pike counties has revitalized his investigative unit in northeast Pennsylvania and has assumed the res- ponsibility for the additional counties of Lackawana, Susquehanna, and Monroe. Ed resides at 187 Grandview Avenue, Honesdale, PA 18431; telephone (717) 253-5933. He is to be highly commended for his personal vitality in providing the essential leadership in this area. As an example, at his first reorganization meeting, he processed twenty-two new applicants and renewed two former members. Robert M. Hipp, State Director for Pennsylvania and your director are very proud of Ed's accomplishments. This is a challenge to other State Section Directors by Ed Bailey to duplicate his performance. MUFON's unique organization structure not only encourages local groups to set up investigative teams, but is a motivational factor that other UFO organizations have not recognized for strong and healthy growth. The upcoming MUFON UFO SYMPOSIUM in Dayton, Ohio, on July 29 and 30, 1978 should be our finest, based upon the high caliber of speakers and their subjects. Leonard Stringficld's talk titled \"Retrievals of The Third Kind\"-A case Study of alleged UFOs and Occupants in Military Custody may be the most significant disclosure ever made, as he presents substantial facts that eliminate the many rumors, which have cloaked these exciting events. On Sunday afternoon from 2:00 to 4:30 PM, Walt Andrus will present a slide illustrated lecture titled \"Revisiting the Major Close Encounter Cases for 1972 through 1976\" in which each participant will have the opportunity of being at the scene of the close encounter and being exposed to facts not readily available to UFO researchers. It will have its maximum appeal to the general public. Mrs. Jennie Zeidman of Columbus, Ohio, may narrate the Lawrence Coyne helicopter case which is a part of this presentation. It will span the period starting with the Delphos, Kansas, landing trace case and concluding with the abduction of the three women in Stanford, Kentucky. UFO NEWSCLIPPING SERVICE The UFO NEWSCLIPPING SERVICE will keep you informed of all the latest United States and World-Wide UFO activity, as it happens! Our service was started in 1969, at which time we contracted with a reputable international newspaper-clipping bureau to obtain for us, those hard to find UFO reports (i.e., little known photographic cases, close encounter and landing reports, occupant cases) and all other UFO reports, many of which are carried only in small town or foreign newspapers. \"Our UFO Newsclipping Service issues are 20-page monthly reports, reproduced by photo-offset, containing the latest United States and Canadian UFO newsclippings, with our foreign section carrying the latest British, Australian, New Zealand and other foreign press reports, Also included is a 3-5 page section of \"Fortean\" clippings (i.e. Bigfoot and other \"monster\" reports). Let us keep you informed of the latest happenings in the UFO and Fortean fields,\" For subscription information and sample pages from our service, write today to: UFO NEWSCLIPPING SERVICE Route 1 — Box 220 Plumerville, Arkansas 72127"}]
