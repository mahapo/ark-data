FROM THE EDITOR Because of the immense amount of material to be covered, this issue of the Journal has been expanded to 28 pages. A tele- phone call from \"Mr. Ed\" as we went to press resulted in a few corrections that should be mentioned regarding his experiences. Some of the minor events that occurred at 3:00 and 3:30 am, 12-2-87, for example, are reversed in the article. By the second time frame, both he and his wife were wide awake. On the occa- sion when Sentinel editor Duane Cook accompanied him, 1-24- 88, he did not tell Cook \"it is after you, too, and you should get back in the truck.\" He said that \"the UFO had ahold of my ner- vous system, for want of a better word. Yes, I wanted the pain to stop, but they didn't do it because I asked them to. They just stopped it when they decided to. Also, it sounds like the second car was parked right behind my pickup, which it wasn't. In fact, it was some distance away around a curve in the road.\" Our apologies for any other errors that may have crept into this account. Details will be provided as they become available. The last word as we go to press is that at least two other photo ses- sions have taken place, one involving a Nimslo Stereo (3-D) camera. These and subsequent developments will of course be reported in a future issue of the Journal. Walt Andrus is flying to Pensacola, Florida on March 3, 1988 to meet with Charles Flan- nigan and investigators, due to new developments in this case.

First, the good news. For starters, the Journal has expanded to 24 pages. More importantly, we believe, we have been able to fill those additional pages with meaty, meaningful material, not fluff. At the same time, a gradual and hopefully continual improvement in the quality of all our articles, graphics and departments has been initiated. \"The Night Sky,\" by MUFON con- sultant in astronomy, Walter N. Webb, should prove invaluable in eliminating possible IFOs of an astronomical and \"mundane\" origin. It should also, we hope, bestow a greater appreciation of the cosmos in which we find our- selves. If that sounds too flowery, you simply haven't investigated the night sky overhead lately, regardless of whether it contains UFOs or not. Lest we forget, they remain a mys- tery, but one that is ultimately inspired by the simple vastness of space that surrounds us. Keeping in track and tune with Webb's excellent summary of coming celestial events is one way to perceive things in perspective. In addition, we've added Bob Grib- ble's historical review of UFO events, \"Looking Back.\" Perhaps not every UFO incident related herein should be taken as gospel, given the dispar- ity of sources and the fact that all his- torical cases are subject to constant revision. Nonetheless, \"Looking Back\" provides a valuable survey of past events and people in the field, one that reveals a prodigious amount of research and personal expenditure of time and energy and we remain indebted. As an example of unselfish sharing of UFO data, it may be unmatched in today's literature. Individual articles that have appeared in the Journal over the course of the last year could also be cited. But suf- fice it to say that all have been sub- mitted freely and without regard to individual sacrifice. Almost without exception, the contents of the Jour- nal are contributed above and beyond the pressures of everyday living. I, as editor, and you, as subscriber and reader, owe all involved a debt of thanks, for taking time out to care and share. I could list an impressive roster of contributors. I decline to, only out of fear of omitting someone. The bad news? Ironically, the down- side of publishing the Journal is a direct outgrowth of the upside. Be- cause more material is available, and more material goes into each issue, more material has to be processed by yours truly. The day, if ever there was one, when I could visualize a personal relationship with each con- tributor is long since gone. There are simply not enough hours in the day or week for me to respond personally to each contributor. As one who makes my own living writing, I deeply regret this develop- ment. Many have been the times when I've cursed a recalcitrant or noncommittal editor for their failure to respond promptly to my various pleas. Now I know why. As a writer I had only one editor to contend with; as an editor, I find myself trying to accommodate anywhere from 30 to 50 individual contributors. Inevitably, some of you get lost in the shuffle, and for this I must apologize. DELAYS If you've submitted something to the Journal recently, and it has not yet appeared in print, this is not a promise that it will. On the other hand, every reasonable effort is made to incorporate submitted material. By the same token, some things get lost in the monthly melee; either they are superceded by superior material or simply become outdated and must take their turn behind more current or relevant material. Unfortunately, it is impossible to keep every contribu- tor informed of the present status of his or her submission. I simply have to ask you to bear with me. Your contributions, in the meantime, are greatly appreciated. Another source of potential delay is the fact that we are presently in the midst of changing printers. Ultimately, this will lead to improved graphics, reduced deadlines, and so on. But until the process is complete, it means some articles on hand will be further delayed until they can be reset, proofread again, and so on. We ask your patience on past matters, while the present work goes forward. Looking to the future, one thing we would like to do is initiate a periodic bibliography of articles, books, reviews, etc., pertaining to any aspect of the UFO phenomenon, be it psychologi- cal, social, philosophical or physical. Here's how the process might work. If you come across any relevant material, from whatever source, simply make a copy of the article or com- mentary, and forward it to this editor. If a copy is not possible or desirable, simply forward the information itself, being sure to include all pertinent bib- liographical data, such as author, date, publication, page, issue, and so on. Include any brief comments or analysis as you see fit. When enough of these have accumulated, they will be published periodically in suitable form, thus becoming part of the available UFO data bank. Again, such submissions need not have \"UFO\" in the title; they may pertain to any aspect of the pheno- menon, from discoveries in cosmol- ogy and astronomy, to developments in hypnosis and clinical psychology. In this way a broad base for optional additional reading and study can be \"painlessly\" compiled for the benefit"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"of all. Needless to say, such a biblio- graphy should address the \"con\" as well as the \"pro\" aspects of ufology; we are after solutions here and not preordained answers or opinions. If you come across something of poten- tial interest, let the rest of us make up our minds as to its relevance. The object is to list, not censor, the avail- able material. By way of example, here are some recently encountered articles in my own experience. The eventual format is intended to be' both serious and informal.

Keel's article lays the blame on the \"popularity,\" if that's the word, of flying saucers to science-fiction author, editor and racon- teur, the late Ray Palmer (1911-1977).

If not controversial enough, Abutaha went on to theorize that glowing, plasmalike UFOs\" may have their origins there as well.

Ware, Florida State Director, Charles D. Flannigan, Lead Investigator and Walter H. Andrus, Jr., International Director Copyrighted by the Mutual UFO Network, Inc. (MUFON) March 1988 INTRODUCTION By journalistic policy, the MUFON UFO JOURNAL does not publish a UFO sighting report until it has been thoroughly investigated, evaluated and assigned a definite classification: UFO, IFO, hoax, misperception, or deluded witness. It is extremely rare when we have an on-going UFO case in which the investigators are practically living with the witness and have a first hand opportunity • to observe and photo- graph the object when and if it returns. We are going to break a precedent and invite our readers to join the team of field investigators, through the pages of the MUFON UFO JOURNAL, in their search for evi- dence and answers to this incredible UFO photographic and CE III case. After meeting with \"Mr. Ed,\" studying the photographs, viewing his video tape and observing him reenact his terrifying experiences, my first re- sponse when asked for a statement for publication was simply \"Amazing — It's Incredible.\" As an \"objective- skeptic,\" the evidence when first presented to me was overwhelming. Officially, the Mutual UFO Net- work will not, under any circumstan- ces, issue a statement on the authen- ticity of this case until our investigation has been concluded and all of the facts and evidence are revealed, recorded, and evaluated by pertinent members of the MUFON Board of Advisors — our Consultants. In the meantime, everyone can benefit by learning the methods and techniques used to unravel this mystery as it unfolds before us. If this case is exposed as a hoax, Journal readers will be the first to know. Now, let's go to the Florida panhandle gulf coast to join our investigators. GULF BREEZE, FLORIDA One of the most incredible photo- graphic UFO investigations yet was initiated when \"Mr. Ed\" (real name in MUFON file) walked into the Gulf Breeze, Florida Sentinel newspaper office and deposited five, color Pola- roid photographs on the desk of Duane Cook, the editor, on November 16, 1987, with a letter \"To Whom It May Concern\" from the anonymous photographer. Mr. Cook was so impressed with the caliber of the unknown object that he published three of the photos and the letter in the November 19, 1987 issue of the Sentinel (Volume 28, Number 49). The published letter added details about the photographs and the neces- sity for remaining anonymous, since the photographer was a prominent businessman in the community. The letter writer and photographer said \"I wish to remain anonymous, but if these photos and story spark any interest from your readership I may identify myself.\" \"Mr. Ed\" had no concept at that time how these five initial photographs were going to effect the lives of his entire family. Donald M. Ware, State Director for Florida, was alerted by a friend in Gulf Breeze when the story was pub- lished on November 19th, kicking off the investigation. Charles D. Flanni- gan, MUFON investigator in Pensa- cola, was assigned to lead the investi- gation due to his proximity to Gulf Breeze (only 6 miles across Pensa- cola Bay). Gary A. Watson, also of Pensacola, worked closely with Mr. Flannigan on this intriguing case. The Sentinel is a weekly newspaper, dis- tributed each Thursday in the Gulf Breeze area. Several local and nearby citizens came forward to report what they had observed on November 11, 1987 after reading the November 16th edition of the Sentinel. The prime question from readers was \"Is this object in the photograph a real UFO?\" This was the same question facing Donald Ware and his team of competent investigators, who were determined to find out. Joe Turner and Allison Brown, reporters for the Sentinel, interviewed eyewitnesses re- porting their sightings to the news- paper. Mr. Turner also called Walt Andrus in 'Seguin to alert him during this inquiry period. Results of MUFON interviews with independent witnesses, Mr. and Mrs. Charles Somerby and Mrs. Zammit concerning sightings of the same object on November 11, 1987, will be included in the April 1988 issue of the JOURNAL. On December 3, Duane Cook and Donald Ware appeared on a 30- minute TV, call-in show and attempt- ed to convince the local residents that they could interview witnesses without disclosing their identity. The next morning Mr. Ed, a successful businessman, called Donald Ware and offered to let MUFON make an on-the-scene investigation. The door was now open to conduct a full scale inquiry. (Mr. Ware, in Ft. Walton Beach, lives only 42 miles from the witness/photographer, so was there- fore readily available.) Robert E. Reid, Colonel USAF Retired, joined the investigative team at this point. A considerable amount of detail was obtained on subsequent sightings and additional photographs when Mr. Ed invited State Director, Donald M. Ware and Investigator Leader, Cha- rles D. Flannigan to his home on January 7, 1988. A four-hour, audio taped interview was conducted cover-"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"ing all incidents from November 11, 1987 through January 6, 1988. Each of these events will be described chronologically as related by Mr. Ed. NOVEMBER 11,1987 At dusk on November 11, 1987 (sun set at 1655 C.S.T.), Ed observed a glow in the southwest sky while sit- ting at his desk in his home. After going outside to investigate, he observ- ed a very unusual aerial object in the sky, which prompted him to rush back into his home. He picked up his Polaroid camera and took four pho- tos (108 film) from his porch, facing the street, within 3 to 4 minutes (Photos #1, 2, 3, and 4). He dropped the film on the driveway after taking each picture. At this point he ran out of film, so he ran back into the house to get a new pack. He reloaded the camera and took photo number 5 as the object approached. (We have reproduced the Sentinel's half-tones in the Journal). The story became very bizarre from this point as Ed reenacted the event to Don and Charles. He said he then went into the street in front of his house, raised his camera for another picture, and suddenly found himself frozen in a blue beam. During the approximately ten seconds while in the beam, Ed described the follow- ing physical sensations: (1) Eyebrows (eyes) would not move, (2) He could not expand his chest, (3) He felt like he was going to die, (4) He could breathe barely, but there was a nasty smell (he said to the investigators, \"try to breathe without moving your chest\" as an example), (5) He started to pant when breathing became difficult, and (6) He thought his life was over. At this point, Ed felt himself being lifted off the road. He described a huge pressure over his entire body. He said \"the force holding you is so strong that you don't know it is hold- ing you. The only reason you know is because you can see.\" When asked by the investigators if he could feel being levitated, he didn't know. As he was being taken upward within the blue beam, he heard a voice talking to him \"through his head, not his ears,\" like he was some kind of an animal. The authorative voice said, \"Stop that! You will not be harmed. Be still. Stop that! We will not hurt you.\" He felt like \"they\" were trying to calm him down. He then received a sensa- tion like someone was flipping through a book showing him pages of dog pic- tures. There were \"words or some- thing\" at the bottom of each page identifying the dog. At this point he screamed, but the sound \"doesn't come out right.\" He described the sound as if he were at the bottom of a swimming pool. \"If you could scream, it would be kind of hollow, like it was only in my ears and not getting out of the beam.\" Ed thinks he was about three feet above the street when he fell to the ground. The object and beam were no longer in sight. As he hit the ground, his knees buckled, and he fell forward on the blacktop street. He gasped for \"real air.\" While being in the beam he des- cribed the air as \"that smelly stuff.\" Even though mentally and physically disturbed, he rolled over and looked up to see a distant airplane (had air- plane lights configuration). As he got back to his feet, his wife drove up in her van having been gone only a short time to purchase food for their evening meal. Ed said his wife helped him pick up the Polaroid pictures from the driveway. He added that \"She said he was reeking with a smell of cinnamon and ammonia.\" When Ed explained to her what had hap- pened she said, \"Oh my God!\" His wife did not see anything unusual while she was gone or during her drive home. NOVEMBER 20,1987 4:00 pm CST (1600): Ed heard a \"humming\" sound while sitting in his home office. He told his wife that something weird was happening. He said \"It's the same sound as when they were trying to pick me off the ground\" while in the beam on Novem- ber 11. He said he associated this sound with the beam, but didn't think it was important at the time. (It was louder while in the beam.) Ed des- cribed the hum like the sound of a hand vibrator placed next to one's head. He went outside and surveyed"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"both his front and backyard. He was concerned that his wife might think him crazy for hearing \"hums\" in his head. Then he returned to his office to work and his wife continued her housework. 4:45 pm (1645): Ed heard a sound like air brakes ... \"wooish.\" He went outside to the front porch, remaining under the roof line, to look around. He heard and described a voice with incredible consonants. Since he could not understand it, he thought it might be an African dialect. He felt he was only hearing half of some conversa- tion. The conversation would pause and then resume, lasting about 10-15 minutes. 4:58 pm (1658), an object with lights came down in almost the same trajectory as the November llth experience. He said, \"the object came down with incredible speed like it knew where it was going.\" Then a computer-like voice said, \"Step for- ward.\" (At this time Ed was still standing at the corner of a small porch.) He took photo #6 (not illus- trated in this article.) He then heard another voice, perhaps female, speak- ing in Spanish, \"Photographs are prohibited.\" In spite of the warning, he took three more pictures (photos 7, 8 and 9, not published in this arti- cle). He then observed a flashing of nude women pictures; the most atro- cious, disgusting nude women you could imagine, like a catalog, that included both Negroes and Chinese people. Since a similar experience had frightened him so bad on the November llth encounter, he did not venture out from under the roof. At 5:03 pm (1703), the object dis- appeared. Ed is unsure, but he thinks it started to glow and went straight up. DECEMBER 2,1987 3:00 am (0300): Ed was sleeping peacefully when the humming sound started, but assumed it must be the swimming pool pump. When this was followed by the sound of a baby cry- ing, his brain could not justify this since there are no babies in their household. Ed's eyes were fully open by this time. He now described hear- ing a Spanish conversation between a female and male. (Ed is reasonably fluent in Spanish.) The conversation, as he remembered, sounded like the following: Male: \"If they don't give me some- thing other than bananas I'll (blank).\" Female: \"Hush, they'll hear you. Do they just eat bananas?\" Male: \"S.O.B., look at all those (blank). Maybe twenty.\" Female: \"No, I saw them last night ... The Chief... Taking power fuel.\" Deciding to investigate the source of the voices, Ed quietly slipped out of bed with his 38-caliber pistol and picked up his camera. A male voice is heard that appears to be a complaint about wanting/clothes, saying \"leather for skin.\" With camera and pistol in hand, he went into his backyard and took Photo #10 (not illustrated) of an object hovering 150-200 feet beyond his back fence. When the object dis- appeared, Ed went back to bed. 3:30 am (0330): Per his \"UFO log book,\" Ed heard his Spitz dog bark once. His dog never barks just once, but always barks continuously when something unusual is present. Ed carefully crawled out of bed so as not to disturb his wife (king-sized bed), thinking that the object had returned. He slid across the carpeted floor on his back, thinking that \"they\" can hear him. He crawled over to the double French doors leading to the screened porch and pulled a waffle- type blind up. Standing on the other side of the windows of the French door was a creature, \"eyeball-to- , eyeball,\" peering at Ed. (He was stooped over). He made a loud scream, falling, half-way back across their master bedroom, waking his wife abruptly. Upon observing the frightening event, Ed said his wife was \"going crazy.\" As Ed got to his feet; he saw the creature turn and run outside of the screened porch. The creature was described as being about four feet tall with a shield over its head, chest and lower body. Distinctive, large almond- shaped eyes were observed through a clear portion of the head mask. It was holding an illuminated rod in its right hand. At first Ed thought it was inside a \"box-like thing\"; but as the creature turned around to leave, it looked more like a front shield only, since it was thin and flat. Even though it was dark, the outline of the creature was visible because of dis- tant background lights of illumination 7"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"Fifth in a series of five Polaroid prints. from the rod. (The house lights were not turned on. Figure 1 is the front view drawing Ed made of the crea- ture. The dotted lines show a side and rear view of arms, body and legs.) As Ed opened the French door dead-bolt locks, he could see the creature running toward a large open field behind his house. The shape of the creature was discernible from the back side as it rapidly retreated from the screened porch with Ed in hot pursuit. When he exited the screened porch exterior door and stepped out on the redwood deck, surrounding the swimming pool, he was hit with a blue beam. His leg was suddenly \"nailed\" to the wooden deck from the knee down to his bare foot. He was twisting and turning as he fell to the desk. He found himself lying on the deck with the screen door frame behind him, trying to get sufficient leverage to pull the stuck bare foot out of the blue beam without getting his other foot into the beam. He could feel the beam when his other foot touched it. The harder he yanked, the harder it held. Finally, pulling hard and steady on the screen door frame, his foot came out and the beam vanished. The beam diameter was estimated at 28 inches on the deck and left no residual trace. The beam expanded in diameter as it got closer to him. 3:35 am (0335): Ed ran back into the house and retrieved his camera and ran outside again. He took Photo 8 Photo No. 11 showing UFO with blue beam. -to 4' TALL DARK GK.EY/BLACK ED SAID HE DU> NOT 6«E .IMDiVlOOAL LOOKED UIKE THIN BOXES Mr. Ed's drawing of the bedroom visitor, 12-2-87"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"Photo No. 13, 12-17-87.

DECEMBER 5,1987 5:45 am (0545) C.S.T.: Ed woke up normally (no hum was heard). He observed the object over the field behind his house perhaps 20 feet above the ground and 450-500 feet from his house. He returned to his house, retrieved his camera and took photo #12 (not published in this arti- cle.) The object may have been ascending as the photo was taken as it immediately disappeared. DECEMBER 17,1987 1:00 am (0100): Ed was awakened by a sound like a waterfall both in his head and his ears. He hurriedly got his Polaroid camera, realizing the flash cube was in place, and took photo #13 as illustrated. The object's altitude was estimated at 80 feet. The photo, with flash, illuminated the pampus grass r bush that Ed was hid- ing behind. The light emanating from the bottom of the object was chang- ing from orange to pale-orange repeat- edly. Ed thought the object was hav- ing some kind of trouble as a grayish-looking smoke or steam was falling from the bottom. He could hear something like liquid hitting the ground. When Ed went out into the field to investigate later that day, where he thought the object was hovering he found a small plastic but- ter tub container filled with a light- green liquid. It appeared to contain rainwater, moss, and dirt, however the liquid was actively bubbling. He thought this was strange so he brought the plastic tub and contents into the house. It was still bubbling rather vigorously during the taped interview by Donald Ware and Cha- rles Flannigan on January 7, 1988. When the team of investigators visited Mr. Ed on January 16, 1988, there was still bubbling occurring in the tub, however a sample quantity poured into a bottle and capped stopped bubbling when it had no access to air. The sample was taken by Robert D. Boyd to Mobile, Alabama on Jan- uary 17th to be analyzed. (A report had not been received regarding the contents within the water as of Feb- ruary 16th.) The odor from the plas- tic container smelled like deteriorat- ing moss or mold, however some chemical action was taking place to create bubbles. (This water probably has no relationship to the object hov- ering over the field, but it must be analyzed if the investigators are to perform a thorough job, leaving no possibilities open to chance. Robert D. Boyd is the CUFO's Investigator Coordinator and MUFON State Direc-"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"Photo No. 14 taken night of 12-17-87.

Photo #14 was taken showing light being pro- jected and illuminating the ground under the object. Ed became very excited when he anticipated possible future events and said to himself, \"yes, the S.O.B. is down. It will be there in the morning and everybody will see it. We got the whole thing full of aliens.\" His wish was not fulfilled. After about three minutes, the light source on the bottom became brigh- ter and it took off, flying very fast directly toward Ed. When it slowed down and hovered, photo #15 was taken (not illustrated). Photo #16 was taken as the object came closer to the house, providing a bottom view when it was nearly overhead. It depicted a white outer ring and inter- nal gold and white light on the bot- tom within the ring (note the bush in his backyard). Of all the photographs 10 made by Mr. Ed, photo #17 is nearest to the camera as it passed over his house. (Note the roof eves, rose trel- lis, and rose bush outside of his mas- ter bedroom. As part of the investiga- tion team, your International Director took 35mm slides of each area where photographs were made to document the environment.) DECEMBER 22,1987 5:15 pm (1715): Ed heard the \"humming\" sound which lasted for 9 or 10 minutes. When he went outside to look in both the front and back of his home, nothing was observed. Ed later speculated that this humming might have been associated with the anonymous photographer, \"Believer Bill,\" whose nine color prints with a toy \"Hot-Shot\" camera appeared in the Gulf Breeze Sentinel drop-box at 8 am on December 23,1987. In a statement by Walt Andrus in the January 21, 1988 edition of the Sentinel, a request was made to \"Believer Bill\" to come forward and reveal the date, time, and precise location that he had made his nine photographs of the same or a similar object. This information is essential as an important step to either cor- roborate or disprove the authenticity of Ed's own photographs. Since this is an on-going investigation, with new events occurring weekly, we needed solid evidence to provide answers in this bizarre case. DECEMBER 23,1987 5:55 am (0555): Ed told investiga- tors that he went out his backdoor to turn on the pool pump before sunrise (sunrise was 6:39 am). He saw three UFOs that appeared to be over an apartment complex just beyond a row of trees. All were at low level. While he was in the house getting his camera, he said one moved to a higher level. He took Photo #18 showing three similar objects. He said \"as soon as I lowered the camera, the"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"iS Photo No. 16 (above) taken as object approaches 12-17-87.

As soon as picture was taken, top object brightened and disappeared. top one brightened and went up fas- ter than I could raise my head to fol- low it.\" A second or so later the other two did likewise. He got the impression that they had waited until he took the picture. DECEMBER 28,1987 8:00 pm (2000): Ed was sitting on one of the back porches writing in his UFO Log Book, with his back toward the pool. He observed a glow over the field in his peripheral vision. It came toward the house with no humming noise present. Since Ed was out of Polaroid film, he secured his Camcorder Sony Video 8 Model CCD M8 with fixed lens. He sneaked around the bushes in his backyard and took two minutes of video. The object can be clearly observed on the 12 video tape, first moving across the screen before disappearing behind a tree (right to left), then returning with different lighting (partial bottom view), traveling from left to right. All fixed lights in the video tape remain sta- tionary. The only sound besides the rustling in the bushes is a distant train whistle. JANUARY 6,1988 6:00 pm (1800): Ed heard a \"hum\" for approximately one minute. He went to the front and back of the house, but observed nothing. JANUARY 12,1988 5:10 pm (1710): While at home, Ed heard a \"hum\" of short duration. He excitedly called Donald Ware's home in Ft. Walton Beach with the news, hoping that an investigator nearby could respond. (Don's son took the call in his father's absence.) As a con- tractor, Ed remembered that he need- ed to check the power meter installa- tion on one of his buildings being prepared for electrical inspection. (In recalling the series of events, he believes this thought crossed his mind before he heard the hum, how- ever it may or may not have any bearing on the events to follow.) 5:25 pm (1725): Ed left home in his pickup truck and drove east out of Gulf Breeze about 7 miles on U.S. 98 and turned right on Highway 191-B. When he was about one-half mile south on the black top road, the object flying in the same direction as he was driving came over his pickup truck and emitted a white beam"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"Photo No. 19 taken through windshield January 12, 1988. through the windshield partially immo- bilizing his forearms and hands. He managed to get the truck off on the left shoulder of the highway so he could make a fast 180-degree turn and exit the area of the object. His hands and arms were numb and stinging, like many pin pricks. The object moved very fast to a short distance in front of the truck (approximately 180 feet) and hovered 2 or 3 feet left of the double yellow centerline and only a few feet above the road. He tried reaching for his shotgun behind the driver's seat, but could not feel it due to lack of sensa- tion in his fingers. He had knocked his Polaroid camera off the seat while trying to reach his shotgun. After finally retrieving the camera from the floor, where it had fallen, he took Photo #19 of the object through the truck windshield. The glow emitted from the bottom of the object illumi- nated the road very distinctly in the photograph. (Unknown spots appear on the windshield. These spots could be rain drops on the windshield, since it was very cloudy and this area of Florida received considerable rain during January. Comment by Walt Andrus and not in original report.) Ed said the object brightened up, took off, and came toward him. With camera and shotgun in hand, and his hands still semi-paralyzed, he clumsily attempted to crawl under the pickup truck for protection from the object's light beam. Before he could get com- pletely under the truck, the white beam struck the back of both his legs from the knees down, thus making it very difficult for hiim to crawl under the truck. The object again hovered over the road in front of him as he peered out between the front wheels. He lay there struggling with shotgun and camera, with semi-paralized arms and legs. He tried taking a photo- graph while under the truck, but the picture didn't show anything but a tire. The object started to turn or rotate. To Ed's amazement the blue beam deposited five creatures or aliens on the road, one after the other less than a second apart. All five aliens, each wearing shields and carrying a glowing rod (like December 2, 1987 sighting, figure 1) started walking toward him. A thought flashed through his mind: \"If they can't get me with the white beams, they are sending aliens after me.\" Frightened by the approach of the five small creatures, Ed managed to crawl out from under the truck and get inside of it. He tried to start the engine, which was already idling. He shifted the truck into reverse (auto- matic transmission), made a hurried right turn in the road from the left side and vacated the area imme- diately. (Editor's note: Who said this wasn't a bizarre case?) Ed has since been trying to rational- ize the current situation and feels the scenario could be the following: He thinks \"their\" encounter with him on November 11, 1987 was interrupted by an aircraft when they dropped him on the street in front of his house (in a residential neighborhood). Since he can hear a hum when \"they\" are around, he feels that they want to relieve him of this capability. Donald Ware and Charles Flannigan, the prime investigators, suspect the situa- tion is far more complicated than Ed envisions. JANUARY 16,1988 2:00 am (0200): Ed was awakened from his sleep by a very soft \"hum,\" but of a higher pitch than the pre- vious experiences. He took his camera (but no 38-caliber pistol) to the semi- circular front drive and stood beside his pickup truck, scanning the sky. He saw a red glow in the southern sky about the size of a star. It got larger and larger, and in about ten seconds, a UFO was nearly over- head. It looked entirely different from the photographs illustrated in this article. Ed described this object in the fol- lowing manner to the investigators: \"The reddish glow looked like a transparent energy sheet hanging down from the center. The underside of the object looked blue.\" When he lifted his camera to take a picture, he heard a very loud \"hum\" with the same tone or pitch as on previous occasions. A bright white UFO \"winked\" into the sky. It hovered close to the reddish one. He snapped Photo #20. (Photo not illustrated in this article, but the picture was inspected by each of the investigative team members on January 17, 1988 during our interview in Ed's home.) Don Ware suggested that the white object may be the lower portion of the \"standard UFO\" previously pho- tographed, separated from the rest. On the other hand, Walt Andrus felt 13"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"that Ed had photographed; two differ- ent objects. It was obvious to all of the team members, after analyzing the photographs and conducting their interview, that this was an on-going situation and would require closer surveillance to determine its authen- ticity. For the local investigators, it was an \"opportunity of a lifetime\" to investigate a current and probably continuous set of experiences ... time would tell. MUFON investigators purchased handie-talkie radios for themselves and Ed and have proceeded to stake- out the area on every available night that they could break away from home. Gary Watson (Pensacola), Rob- ert E. Reid and his son from Ft. Wal- ton Beach, have participated in these attempts to photograph the UFO independently. Ed was instructed and agreed to call them on his handie- talkie radio whenever he heard the humming sound in his head. (Could this be an implant or a tracking device inserted into Ed's head so only he could hear the humming?) JANUARY 21,1988 10:30 pm (2230): Ed heard a hum. A star-like object was seen briefly by Ed. Bob Reid was staked-out this evening, but the object left before Bob could observe it. Neither man was able to take a photograph. JANUARY 24,1988 5:30 pm (1730): While at home, Ed heard a faint hum. He immediately called on his handheld radio to determine if the investigator's stake- out was operational. When he did not get a response on his radio, he got into his truck and drove to the news- paper office of the Sentinel, where he enlisted the aid of Duane Cook, the editor and his friend, Dari. Duane, carrying Ed's video equipment, was riding in the right seat of the truck as Ed drove east on U.S. 98 from Gulf Breeze. Dari was following in her own car. Dari said that \"Ed looked like he was in a trance.\" (Editor's note: the case enactment now becomes even more bizarre. Ed told Mr. Cook that 14 \"he feels like his face is pulling off. The hum is in his right forehead and feels like they want him out of the truck.\" Ed said \"they are communi- cating with me,\" and added that he received the following message: \"In sleep you know.\" Ed believed that this referred to a recurrent dream. At this point he stepped out of his truck and started writhing as if in pain. Duane got out of the truck to scan the sky, but couldn't see any- thing unusual. Ed said, \"it is after you, too, and you should get back into the truck.\" Light rain was falling so Duane got back into Ed's truck. Ed expressed his displeasure to the hum, and had earlier asked the aliens to get rid of it. The hum stopped. As Ed walked back to the driver's door talking to Duane continuously he said, \"Oh s-, there it is.\" He raised his Polaroid camera and took Photo No. 21 (not illustrated) show- ing the object with the carrying rack on top of his truck in the foreground. Camera elevation was perhaps 55 degrees. Duane was video taping Ed at this moment, but did not see or film the UFO directly over the truck, which departed vertically immediately after Ed took the picture. Parked behind the pickup, Dari did not see the UFO, but did see the flash of the camera. Upon inspection by investi- gators, this photo shows some verti- cal light streaks above the UFO. Obviously, the team of investigators is disappointed that Duane did not step out of the truck and also video tape the UFO, however Duane did video tape the Polaroid film being ejected from Ed's camera. This report covers all events from Nov. 11, 1987 through January 24, 1988, however new photographs con- tinue to emerge. Further details will appear in the April 1988 issue of the MUFON UFO JOURNAL, since this case definitely seems to be continuing based upon recent telephone calls from the prime investigators. ASSOCIATED EVENTS Since there is a possibility that Ed may have had an implant installed in his head at some time in his life (and only recently activated), Robert \"Bob\" Reid opened this inquiry. Ed menti- oned to Bob that he had a strange experience when he was 16 years of age. He recalls seeing a baldheaded man with big eyes beside his bed fol- lowing an incident where a black dog followed him. He and his brother found very wet footprints on the floor. Ed was also quite wet. His brother said \"he felt footprints on his bed,\" but their cat was outside of their home. The sprinkler in their yard ran all night, which might account for the wet feet marks left by a noc- turnal intruder, although not remem- bered by Ed himself. Budd Hopkins has been invited to explore the pos- sibility of an abduction scenario when Ed was 16 years of age. In addition, MUFON is seriously considering the feasibility of conducting a CATSCAN examination of his head to determine if it would reveal the presence of an implant. Hypnosis sessions could pro- vide additional support for such a medical examination. CONFISCATION ATTEMPT On January 13, 1988 at 8:30 am, Ed responded to a knock on his front door, where he was confronted by two men in civilian suits visually exposing large pistols. One of them said \"Are you Ed ?\" to which Ed replied, \"yes, I am.\" \"I'm agent McKathy\"; \"I'm agent \" (Ed didn't remember the name of the second individual.) They flashed IDs but Ed couldn't describe the IDs. We understand you have some photographs of UFOs. It is against the law to withhold them.\" Although they came into his house and looked around in Ed's office, Ed told them that he had given the pic- tures to the Miami Herald reporter, Dave Berry. Ed said, \"If you call Dave he's going to say he doesn't have them, because he told me he would deny having them.\" One man said, \"You know if you are lying to us you are in big trouble, because this is a Material Seizure Warrant.\" They left quietly without any photographs. (It would be sheer speculation to try to identify these two men, however, they knew Ed's actual name and address.)"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"(SoMET/MBS Figure 2. Composite drawing by Mr. Ed.

Donald M. Ware, State Direc- tor for Florida, was so impressed with the diverse ramifications of this case, that he asked MUFON's International Director to drive to Florida to partic- ipate directly by meeting Ed, viewing the original Polaroid photographs and the video tape. After spending several hours at Mr. Ed's home in Gulf Breeze, the team of investigators composed of Donald Ware, Charles Flannigan, Gary Watson, Robert \"Bob\" Reid, Robert D. Boyd (Mobile, Ala- bama) and Walt Andrus went to visit Duane Cook, editor of the Gulf Breeze Sentinel, to study eleven more photographs sent to the paper by two anonymous witnesses. Nine were from \"Believer Bill\" and two from an unknown source. Each color print depicted an object similar to that in Mr. Ed's photos. Walt pro- vided a statement or status report on the case to Duane Cook that was published in the January 21, 1988 edi- tion of the Sentinel. PRELIMINARY EVALUATION Ed now has a two-way radio in his home. His house is being monitored after dark by Gary Watson and Bob Reid with handie-talkies so that Ed may alert them when he hears the humming in his head. On many occa- sions this has been the signal that the UFO is nearby, according to Mr. Ed. As scientific investigators, this may provide MUFON people with an opportunity to photograph the object simultaneously with Ed. The appeal to \"Believer Bill\" made by Walt Andrus in the January 21, 1988 issue of the Sentinel produced positive results. Don Ware received a second letter from \"Believer Bill,\" in which he said the nine photos were developed in the Gulf Breeze Mall shortly after they were taken. He put the camera and film in the \"overnight service\" drop-box about 11:00 pm on December 22, 1987 and picked them up the next morning. He also advised Don where he was standing when the photos were taken. When your International Director first heard of the series of photo- graphs by Mr. Ed, his comment was \"shades of Billy Meier.\" However, after examining the photos and meet- ing Mr. Ed personally, it appears that this could develop into a very signifi- cant case. Based upon MUFON standards for UFO photos, .the credi- bility of the witness is even more important than the photographs them- selves. For this reason, your director drove 1,500 miles roundtrip to meet Mr. Ed. I found him to be a conscien- tious and responsible businessman. I am also very much aware of Ed's flare for dramatics and an unbound- ing enthusiasm to share his experien- ces with investigators. He has lis- tened, cooperated, and followed the instructions and advice of the prime in- vestigators. As I told a United Press International reporter in Pensacola on January 21st, this case is either an elaborate hoax or one of the most. fantastic UFO cases I have had the privilege of personally investigating in the past 30 years. It is premature to make a decision at this time, because even as the March 1988 issue of the Journal is compiled, events continue in Gulf Breeze, Florida under the scrutiny of a very competent team of investiga- tors under the direction of Donald M. Ware and his lead investigator, Cha- rles Flannigan. Mr. Ed has nothing to gain and everything to lose as a busi- nessman in the community if he is involved in a hoax. My only comment at this time is \"read the April JOURNAL for the latest developments in this intriguing case.\" Those closest to the investiga- tion believe that this case could be one of the most significant photogra- phic and CE III cases yet to be inves- tigated, due to its on-going scenario.

(Exact time unknown.) Location: 40 kilometers west of Mundrabilla on the Eyre Highway in Western Australia known as The Basin Duration of incident: 90 minutes INTRODUCTION Harry Griesberg, MUFON Contin- ental Coordinator for Australia and New Zealand filed the following pre- liminary report compiled on February 4th by Keith Basterfield (UFO Re- search South Australia and UFO Research Australia) and Ray Brooke (UFO Research South Australia) and received by MUFON in Seguin on February 17, 1988. In the early hours of Wednesday morning January 20, 1988, the occupants of a number of vehicles traveling along the main highway between Perth, Western Aus- tralia and Adelaide, South Australia were reportedly involved in an inci- dent. This report has been compiled from a personal interview with the main percipients, the Knowles family, an inspection of their vehicle, and from the extensive media coverage given to the incidents, especially from taped video interviews which appeared on television. Hence most material is derived from the original source. It will be some time before an indepth report can be compiled, operating as we have had to do in what can only be described as a \"media circus.\" (Bill Chalker des- cribed it as \"checkbook journalism\" in a telephone call to Walt Andrus.) Ray Brooke fielded almost one hun- dred queries from local, interstate and overseas radio, television and newspaper sources in the forty-eight hours following the breaking of the 16 story. Members of the investigative team in this case have been Keith Basterfield, Ray Brooke, Steve Bol- ton, Vladimar and Pony Godic in Adelaide; Garry Little in Melbourne, and Joan Johnston in Perth. LOCATION The incident occurred on a stretch of the main bitumised highway be- tween Perth and Adelaide. Between the localities of Madura and Eucla, Western Australia, the area is more locally known as The Basin and it is here that the episode reportedly occurred. (See map 1.) It is an iso- lated stretch of road with the Great Australian Bight (Ocean) to the south (50 kilometers) and a range of hills to the north. THE EVENT As pieced together to date, the sequence of events was as follows: Five vehicles were involved. Three were traveling Eastwards towards Eucla, and two others were on their way Westwards in the direction of Perth. These vehicles were spread over at least a 10-15 kilometer dis- tance and not traveling in a close convoy in either direction. Vehicle one was a car towing a caravan (house trailer), the occupant of which is reported to have almost collided with the Knowles car when driver Sean Knowles said he took evasive action, swerving to avoid a close encounter with the \"object\" on the highway. The identity of the occupant of this vehicle has not been discovered by anyone to date and in fact this person seems to have been overlooked by the media. On Sean's testimony this driver should have seen the object at close range. Vehicle two was a truck driven by an unknown (to us) person who was apparently the first person to advise police in Eucla, W.A. of the incident. We understand that this person made a statement to the Eucla police, how- ever at this stage the police there have declined to release the name. Although details are sketchy, it seems that the Eucla police contacted the Ceduna, S.A. police and advised them that a car had been seen fol- lowed by a light. The Ceduna police then looked for and stopped the Knowles' car and interviewed them. Vehicle three was a truck being driven by a Mr. Graham Henley, 57, a transport operator of Forest Hill, Victoria, who was the first person to speak with the family when both veh- icles stopped at a Mundrabilla road- house. He said that when he saw the family they were \"terror-stricken\" in a state of shock and even their dogs were cowering in the front seat of the car. Mr. Henley said \"he touched the mother's hand where she said that she touched the thing and it was cold, not clammy, but cold like marble.\" Mr. Henley said he had been doing the Nullarbor Plain run for 31 years and in that time many truck drivers had seen mysterious lights hovering over the stretch of road between Madura and Eucla, known as The Basin. Early on Wednesday morning, January 20, 1988 he had been driving through the area with the Knowles car about 10 to 15 kilometers behind him and another truck driven by a friend called \"Porky\" further back. He said he had seen in his rear-vision mirror a bright white light hovering above the car headlights. \"It was hovering above The Basin on a sweeping stretch of road ... just flick- ering in and out between the trees,\" he said. \"I had only just been talking to Porky on the radio but once I saw that light it all went dead.\" Mr. Hen- ley said that, after hiding in the scrub, the family ran out to the road to hail Porky's truck but he ignored them"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"^ because of the dangers of stopping for strangers in the Outback. When he met the family in Mun- drabilla he said \"the whole car smelt like, bakelite or just like as if you'd blown a fuse ... A soot was all over the car and there were four dents as though the car had been picked up by a magnet.\" Mr. Henley said he had checked the tread of the burst (blown) tire and underneath the car but there was nothing to indicate it had swerved off the road. \"I cannot explain it, but all I know is that I saw four very terrified people at 4:45 a.m. on Wednesday morning,\" he said. In a later interview, when the ash on the car was explained by someone as the dust from over-heated brakes, Mr. Henley responded by saying, \"I felt the sooty material on the roof of the car and it was not brake dust. I've been around the car-racing scene and I know what brake dust is like. This stuff was a fine, silicon-type material. It was like powdered glass; it had an incredible feel to it. Brake dust only gets on the wheels, not on the roof, and the brakes weren't even hot.\" (MUFON and FUFOR have both offered financial aid to analyze the ash or dust in both Australia and the United States by independent laboratories to determine its content.) Paul Norman and John Auchettl had an opportunity to examine the car on February 1, 1988. Mr. Norman said \"he found several peculiarities which are being analyzed by profes- sionals.\" (Correspondence from Paul Norman, MUFON State Director for Victoria & UFOR (VA).) Vehicle four was a 1984 blue Ford Telstar car containing the Knowles family from Perth, the main percip- ients; Mrs. Faye Knowles, in her for- ties, and sons Sean 21, Patrick 24 and Wayne 18, who were traveling from Perth, W.A. to Melbourne, Vic- toria for a holiday vacation. Vehicle five was a truck driven by a transport operator whom we now know to be John De Jong (nickname \"Porky\"). This vehicle was at an unknown distance behind the Kno- wles' car. Due to the number of vehi- cles involved and lack of identification of some drivers, it will be some time before we are able to personally Great Australian S;gnf;==s interview all those concerned. MAIN PERCIPIENTS Mrs. Faye Knowles and her sons were interviewed by Keith Basterfield and Ray Brooke during a three-hour video taping session in the studios of Channel 7 in Adelaide, Victoria on January 21, 1988. (Keith was not allowed to use his tape recorder since a contract had been signed by the Knowles family with Channel 7 for exclusive rights for three months, per Bill Chalker's telephone call to MUFON.) At a point west of Mundrabilla, W.A., Sean, the driver saw what he at first took to be a truck's lights approaching them from the east, apparently along the road. As it approached it then disappeared after \"jumping about a bit.\" It became vis- ible again and continued to approach their vehicle. Sean commented that it loked like a \"spaceship.\" It became brighter and bigger. They kept driving towards it when it disappeared. The next thing they knew it was behind them. Sean accelerated the car in an attempt to get away from it. Suddenly it was in front of the car again. At some stage Sean made a U- turn on the highway and traveled westwards for a while, then another U-turn to resume the original east- wards travel, it is not clear whether this was an attempt to elude or follow the light. At another time Sean commented that the light was seen close to their vehicle on the highway and they swerved into the other lane to miss it and nearly collided with vehicle one (a car and caravan) coming the other way. (Please refer to a taped tele- phone interview with Sean by Mike Campbell of CJOR-Radio in Van- couver, B.C.) The exact sequence of events from here is very confused, however these are some of the events which hap- pened: The right rear tire blew out (burst) while they were traveling at speed. Sean said they were driving at 200 kilometers per hour (120 m.p.h.) when the object was chasing them. Sean braked the car to a halt after the tire blew out. Mrs. Knowles said she was sitting in the rear passenger seat behind the driver nearest the center of the road. (Vehicles are driven on the left-hand side of the road in Australia.) She stated she wound down her window and placed her right hand on the car roof. She retracted it after feeling some mate- rial present on the roof. Immediately the back of her hand felt warm for a few seconds, then the sensation faded. A \"greyish-black mist\" came into the car when the family rolled the windows down. The sound of their voices changed in pitch and appeared to slow down. They believed that the object had landed on the roof of their Ford Tel- 17"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"Mrs. Knowles star. When they were questioned about this point, they said they did not see anything protruding to the front, rear or over the sides of the roof as viewed from within the car. A humming sound was heard. Sean blacked-out for an unknown period of time. (In the radio interview, he said \"he was out cold.\") They all became hysterical, and were shouting and crying. Mrs. Kno- wles said she* believed they were going to die. They believed that the car was lifted off the road. However, when each was asked if they looked out of the windows and saw the car off the ground, they had not done so. They stated that when the vehicle was dropped to the ground the tire burst. Their two dogs were \"going crazy\". A smell likened to \"dead bodies\" permeated the air. It should be emphasized that the exact sequence of the above events is still to be obtained from the family. After a period of time, Sean stopped the car. They all got out quickly and hid in the adjacent scrub bushes along the highway. They reported that the light/object remained in the 18 vicinity of their car and then departed. Approximately fifteen minutes after stopping their car and hiding in the scrub, they returned to the car and rapidly changed the blown tire. (Police found their car jack still at the loca- tion during their investigation.) From that point (believed to be 40 kilome- ters west of Mundrabilla), they drove to the Mundrabilla Motor Hotel in West Australia. - TEAM INVESTIGATION The story broke to the team of investigators about 2:30 p.m. on Wednesday, January 20th, some ten hours after it occurred. The Ceduna police telephoned Ray Brooke while the Knowles were present in the police station. Arrangements were made for the family to proceed to Adelaide where they would be inter- viewed and arrangements made to inspect the automobile, documenting the physical evidence. Ceduna police advised us (the investigators) they had secured written statements and a sample of the black deposit for analy- sis. (Sgt. Jim Furnell and Sgt. Fred Longley of the Ceduna Police Dept. conducted an interview and filed their report. Sgt. Longley said Mrs. Knowles and her sons were obviously dis- tressed when they walked into his police station at lunchtime on Janu- ary 20th.) The family spent the night at the Eyre Highway Motel at Wudinna, 350 kilometers northwest of Adelaide. (The car was impounded in Wudinna.) The team of investigators UFOR(SA) could do nothing further until the family and vehicle arrived in Adelaide. Then the story leaked to the media. The family were intercepted enroute and concluded an exclusive contract with the Channel 7 television network. It appeared at this stage that \"checkbook journalism\" had scored over scientific evaluation. On Thursday, January 21st, after negotiations with the network, Mr. Basterfield and Mr. Brooke were able to spend three hours at the Adelaide Channel 7 studios where the Knowles underwent extensive interviews. Be- tween video-taped interviews, Keith and Ray managed to talk informally to all members of the family. No for- mal indepth interview was possible under these circumstances. They were able to confirm the family's basic story as related in this article. The family was distressed and tired at this stage and told the two investi- gators that they wanted to finish all of the television interviews. The Kno- wles family appeared to Keith and Ray to be down-to-earth people trying to cope with some traumatic episode. Indications of a hoax were minimal. Following the end of the TV inter- views at the station, the investigators sought to conduct their own formal indepth interview. However, the fam- ily declined and then left for an undisclosed location, apparently honor- ing their contract with Channel 7. The next day they travelled to Mel- bourne, 800 Kms. away. Since the station had the vehicle hidden away and the Knowles family were not available for further inter- views, Keith and Ray were forced to wait further developments. They ad- vised Channel 7 personnel the direc- tion the evaluation of the vehicle should take before departing the premises. EXAMINATION OF THE KNOWLES AUTOMOBILE: THE CAR"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"The Knowles' vehicle, a 1984 blue Ford AR Telstar GL, front-wheel drive, automatic, sedan, registration number 7GD-560 was made available to Ray Brooks and Keith Basterfield by Channel 7 on February 2nd, after it was transported by truck from Wudinna, South Australia. It was inspected by the team from UFOR(SA)/ UFOR(A). The vehicle was generally in good condition. There was no immediate sign of damage to it when first seen except for a shattered driver's mirror. (Sean advised the team that they hit a kangaroo at one stage of their trip, and it is not known what damage was a result of this collision with the animal.) The bodywork, for its age, was in extremely good condition. (See photograph of the car in this article.) The engine was relatively clean, and there were no signs of panel beating. (Chips or \"dings\" on the doors.) The odometer reading was 102,414 kilometers. TIRES All five tires were tubeless Dunlop Grand Prix steel-belted radials, type P185/75 SR 14. Three of the tires were \"first time\" tires, whereas the right rear (this replaced the one which blew out) was a retread. The damaged tire was found in the boot (trunk of the car). The damaged tire had blown out along a line where the steel belt finishes and starts to go up the wall of the tire in a circular fashion. Its tread was good, perhaps half its original life left, and slightly worn on the outside. ROOF From a distance of a few meters, it was difficult to see the four reported indentations in the roof. At close range, it was possible to locate four small in area, shallow in depth inden- tations. The areas were depressions, not cuts and the paint in these spots was still intact. There was no evi- dence of an indentation in the center of the roof, nor any other prominent mark or scratch. No luggage rack was present. (Two suitcases had been strapped to the roof of the car before The Knowles family ... Patrick, Wayne, Faye and Sean. The Knowles' automobile. the incident, but were reported miss- ing after the episode.) ELECTRICAL The family reported no effects to the engine, lights or clock at the time of the event. The investigators checked the sidelights, headlights, turn and stop indicators, windshield washer, interiorroof light, boot (trunk) light, radio and digital clock and all were found to be operable. When testing the rear red brake lights, they found the righthand light to be inoperable. The battery was a six cell unit (12.6 volts) in good condition. Internal fluid levels were proper. The engine is a gasoline-powered, four-cylinder 2.0 litre capacity motor. 19"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"Ray Brooke with blown tire. Photo by Keith Basterfield. The speedometer, odometer, fuel gauge and temperature gauges functioned. The car was driven by the investiga- tors a short distance to substantiate the above information. It had a small \"Realistic\" brand radio with AM/FM bands and cassette in poor physical condition, having broken knobs, and dual speakers. With the aerial fully extended the unit played fairly well. INTERNA1VEXTERNAL DEPOSITS There was no evidence of any black deposit internally or externally found by the team's inspection, except as stated below. The vehicle had tra- velled from Mundrabilla, W.A. to Wudinna, S.A. (several hundred kilo- meters) under its own power, and was then transported by truck from Wudinna to Adelaide (another few hundred kilometers) before it was viewed. One day prior to the team inspection in Adelaide, Paul Norman, vice president of the Victorian UFO Research Society and John Auchettl had vacuumed the vehicle in order to take samples. Mr. Auchettl told the news media that the dents on the roof could not have been caused by the car rolling, as some reports have 20 suggested. Mr. Norman dismissed the claims that a meteorite \"attacked\" the Knowles family's car on the Nul- larbor Plain. \"They watched it fly off — what sort of meteorite does that?\" he said. The inside floor areas of the car were covered with sand particles, grass particles, pieces of food, empty drink containers and other debris. The one exception as far as black deposits goes is as follows: On the metal trims of the two front wheels, there was a black deposit present. This was not present on the two rear wheels nor the damaged wheel in the car trunk. It was distributed around the trim, but did not extend to the hub cap and wheel cover, wheel nuts nor anywhere else. Its distribution was consistent with originating from the disk brake pads on the two front wheels under heavy breaking, i.e. worn brake linings. PHYSICAL EVIDENCE - PRELIMINARY RESULTS A sample of the black deposit said to have been on and in the vehicle immediately after the event was ana- lyzed by AMDEL (Australian Mineral Development Laboratories) in Ade- laide, for Channel 7. It is believed that this sample was taken on Janu- ary 21,1988. On January 25th, Channel 7 news announced that: \"... analysis of black material on the car reveals that it is mostly iron oxide consistent with residue from worn brake linings.\" They went on to say that the most perfectly circular cut on the right rear tire was probably caused by the vehi- cle running a considerable distance on the rim after the blow out. Shak- ing of the vehicle and smoke entering the car could be explained under these conditions they said. A copy of AMDEL's report has been promised to the investigators. Another sample of the black dep- osit was taken for a forensic squad officer of the South Australian Police Department (SAPD) at Ceduna on January 20, 1988. In discussions with the SAPD on February 1st, they advised no testing of their sample had been undertaken; that the sample col- lected was extremely small, and they would probably turn their sample over to the WAPD in whose jurisdic- tion the event occurred. Mr. Baster- field and Mr. Brooke are currently negotiating with both the SAPD and WAPD for custody of this sample. DAMAGED TIRE As reported by Channel 7, AMDEL have advised that the damaged tire's state is entirely consistent with a normal tire blow-out at high speed. (See photograph of damaged tire held by Ray Brooke as photographed by Keith Basterfield in this article.) FURTHER INVESTIGATIONS We are following various leads including: Seeking copies of statements made to Police. Trying to interview the two truck drivers first on the scene. Endeavoring to document indepen- dent observation of lights in the same area. Awaiting a copy of the AMDEL report. Negotiating with SAPD and WAPD"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"for their sample. Anticipating the results of Paul Norman's testing. Seeking advice from those experts who were reported as advancing hypothesis of various kinds to explain the event, e.g. meteorite fall. IN CONCLUSION As of February 4, 1988 it is the opinion of Ray Brooke and Keith Basterfield that the entire incident, particularly the central experience of the Knowles family, is still open to a number of interpretations. They want to emphasize that the physical evi- dence is not as strong as the media have reported and caution is urged until technical reports are available. NOTES It was reported to have been dark at the time of the event, becoming light at the end. Duration: l l / 2 hours or 90 minutes. There is confusion over the exact time of the episode. It is reported to have commenced at 5 a.m., but it is unclear whether this was Western or South Australia time. The family is also very unclear on this. The Knowles family appeared to be down-to-earth individuals caught up in events beyond their control When Keith and Ray met them, they exhi- bited signs of tiredness, stress and confusion at times. The Mutual UFO Network (MUFON) is deeply indebted to Harry Griesberg (MUFON Continental Coordinator for Australia/New Zealand) for filing three separate progress reports on this case and especially to the prime investigators, Mr. Keith Basterfield, MUFON State Director for South Australia and Mr. Ray Brooke of UFO Research, South Australia. We hope to provide a report from the crew members of the three tuna fish trawlers that saw unusual lights and that of the pilot of the tuna fish spotter aircraft, who independently reported an incident at the same time as the Knowles family in the Great Australian Bight. (Bill Chalker, MUFON State Director for New South Wales, advised MUFON by telephone that the ships would be docking the first week of February.) EXCLUSIVE TELEPHONE INTERVIEW Even though Channel 7 in Adelaide had signed an exclusive contract with the Knowles family, making it more difficult for Keith Basterfield and Ray Brooke to conduct an indepth inves- tigation, Mike Campbell of radio sta- tion CJOR in Vancouver, British Columbia called long distance and interviewed Sean and Patrick Kno- wles in their motel room in Adelaide (January 21, 1988 in Canada). Aileen Edwards in Washington State tape recorded the \"live\" interview, which she has graciously shared with MUFON via Bob Gribble. In order to refrain from repeating statements made to the investigators and already published in the feature article, only brief statements made by Sean and Patrick in response to questions posed by Mike Campbell will be quoted. SEAN KNOWLES \"We saw this thing sitting in the middle of the road, so I asked eve- ryone about it.\" They said \"no, don't disturb it ... As we got closer, I had to drive to the other side of the road to miss it. We nearly hit a car with caravan going the opposite direction. The object disappeared.\" Sean des- cribed the object on the highway in front of them, when asked by Mr. Campbell: \"Egg-shaped, with a round circle in the center, orange-yellow in color. On the sides it looked like it had sorta birdwings.\" When Sean was asked about the car being picked up he said, \"I can't really explain it. I put me foot on the brake because going such a hard speed — can't remember after that — out cold.\" Could you feel a sensa- tion of being lifted? Sean replied: \"A force which was unreal — felt like^I was dead.\" When Mike inquired about the tire exploding, Sean with extreme difficulty in his voice said: \"pretty hard to explain ... (followed by two long sighs).\" Since Sean had said he was \"out cold,\" Mr. Campbell asked if all four people had lost con- sciousness. Sean could not speak for the others, since he didn't know for sure. He continued by saying, \"Mum put her hand out of the window —felt a leather-like thing out there.\" Mr. Campbell said as an aftermath — can you believe the experience? to which Sean replied, \"yes I can — it went on for l l / 2 hours.\" Still probing into how long they were airborne and the length of time the object was on the roof of the car, Sean could only say \"I don't know because I was out cold.\" PATRICK KNOWLES Mike Campbell asked Sean if Patrick was now out of the shower so he could speak with him. When Patrick came to the telephone, Mike asked him to tell the listening audience what actually happened. Patrick related the following: \"I run the window down — our voices went strange — dust started coming in the car. After the gas stuff entered the car, the car then dropped. It strained our bodies.\" Patrick's response to the length of time that the car was elevated was \"Not for sure.\" When asked if they suffered fear, Patrick said: \"Fear? — I was too stunned to actually feel fear. It was the worst experience in me life.\" When the car was picked up he exclaimed, \"Oh God! Oh Boy! it couldn't be happening! — that's when the car dropped.\" Mike then asked what happened next, to which Patrick answered, \"It dropped us. We got out of the car and ran into the bushes. We hid in the bushes 15 to 20 minutes — it was really there. We tried to stop some truckers — strange things happening up there.\" Patrick said it only took them three minutes to change the tire. The trucker from Perth told them they were shaking and looked like ghosts, later on. These are the essential quotes and comments made by the two young men to Mike Campbell. They still sounded \"shook up\" during the interview to this observer. SIMILAR TASMANIAN INCIDENT REVEALED 21"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"When the Knowles family incident appeared in the news media on Janu- ary 21, 1988, a Victorian UFO Research Society field officer, Mr. Pat Gildea revealed an incident in Tasmania that was very similar in nature to the bright, egg-shaped Nullarbor light. On December 14, a prominent Launces- ton, Tasmania businessman claimed he saw a colored, egg-shaped object while driving his white Mercedes- Benz on a deserted country road about 10:30 p.m. He thought the \"bright, white light\" hovering above him was only a helicopter, but as he drove on he noticed the light appeared to be following him. Then the light landed on the road in front of him. The man brought his car to a halt and put on the hand- brake. At this point, the engine stopped 'and the automobile lights went out. \"He panicked and ran back down the road but then stopped to look back,\" Mr. Gildea said. He noticed that the car was being dragged towards the light. He could only make out an oval-shaped object. Mr. Gildea said another man arrived at the scene just in time to see the object take off on an angle and \"dis- appear into the night sky.\" When the owner came back to his Mercedes, it was covered with a sooty type of carbon. The car's electrical system had also been damaged. (No explana- tion of the damage to the car was given.) The tar or blacktop on the road had melted where the light had landed and skid marks were left on the road where the car had been dragged. (The hand brake had been set when he got out of the car.) Mr. Gildea said the Launceston businessman was stunned when details of the Knowles family's experience were described to him. \"He was amazed — it sounds exactly like the same object. Before this, he did not think UFOs existed,\" Mr. Gildea said. (Mr. Paul B. Norman is the Vice President of the Victorian UFO Re- search Society and the MUFON State Director for Victoria.) MUFON Amateur Radio Net News By Dave Dobbs, K8NQN MUFON 1030Oldtowne Rd. Seguin Texas 78155 EMERGENCY CALLING TIMES AND FREQUENCIES In the event of a national mergency involving UFOs, or a local UFO emergency receiving national news coverage, it is essential that we be able to activate a MUFON Amateur Radio Net at any time. Many net members liaison with their state and local area MUFON directors and investigators who will need details and current information. Contact with Headquarters in Texas may be required. Therefore, manager and control sta- tions of the existing nets have agreed on the following plan. Calling times will be the first fifteen minutes of each four hour interval beginning from the familiar forty meter net schedule. The daylight fre- quency will be as close as possible to the usual be as close as possible to the usual 7.237 MHz. A night time frequency around 3.990 MHz has been selected. The calling times and frequencies apply to any day of the week. Stations able to hear nets operating in other parts of the coun- try will be asked to liaison with them. 22 Please post this information at your operating position for ready refer- ence, after converting the eastern time to your own if necessary. EST/EDT MHz 0000-0015 3.990 0400-0415 3.990 0800-0815 7.237 1200-1215 7.237 1600-1615 7.237 2000-2015 3.990 In addition, 28.470 MHz, in the Novice/Technician portion of the ten meter band, is recommended as a local calling frequency at the same times. NOVICES AND TECHNICIANS The new TEN METER UFO NET is now in experimental operation. Listen for it on Sunday afternoons at 3 pm EST (2000 Z) around 28.470 MHz. Licensed amateurs of all classes are cordially invited to participate. They need not be a MUFON member, so please inform ham friends and rel- atives with an interest in UFOs. They'll even let you talk, if you like! Net control is WD8ARZ in Michi- gan. Operators who can't hear him should check in with stations who are in contact with him and ask to be relayed. Conditions will improve rapid- ly as we move farther into the new sunspot cycle. FORTY METER NET SEEKS WESTERN MEMBERS Interest continues to grow in the primary MUFON Amateur Radio Net which meets every Saturday morning at 8:00 am EST/EDT on 7.237 MHz. About twenty stations are now check- ing in regularly. They cover the U.S. from the east coast to Colorado and Texas. Because media reporting of UFO events varies widely, the ex- change of reports is most valuable. Some MUFON directors also keep the net advised of activity in their areas, which is greatly appreciated. Western key stations will be alert to relay check-ins from the Pacific and Mountain Time Zones during the informational part of the net, around 5:45 - 6:00 am PST. Listen for WA5CTJ in San Antonio, W5UAA in Oklahoma, or NG1E in Colorado, and"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"give them a call. WEST COAST NETS NEEDED Why isn't there a MUFON net in the west which meets at a time con- venient for the Pacific and Mountain Time Zones? Surely someone must be willing to start a forty meter net in California at 0800 Saturday mornings, for instance. And there must be a Novice or Technician willing to start a ten meter UFO net west of the Rockies. Liaison operators from the existing nets can check in to pass traffic. The ten meter net will soon become reliable enough for that pur- pose. Contact WA3QLW or K8NQN if you're interested. We're good in the Callbook. Letter To The Editor... Dear Editor, I was surprised to see my by-line attached to an article (\"MJ-12 Jury Still Out\") in the November issue of the JOURNAL. The article, of course, consists entirely of the text of CUFOS' press release of last September. I did not write that press release and my name appears nowhere on it. How did your editorial staff get the idea that I am the author? The release was based mostly on material supplied CUFOS by Bill Moore and Stan Friedman, with some editorial addition and sub- traction by George Eberhart and me. The final product was a hodgepodge with no single author. If I personally wrote more than three or four sent- ences, I'd be surprised. I think the points the article makes are sound and I believe the MJ-12 matter will remain unresolved until a competent document examiner has a chance to study the briefing paper and to announce his findings. But for purposes of keeping the record straight, I would appreciate it if you informed your readers that I am not the author of the article. Sincerely, Jerome Clark In Others' Words By Lucius Parish The NATIONAL ENQUIRER has returned to the UFO subject re- cently, even if the many sightings in Virginia were not \"spectacular\" enough for coverage in that publication. The January 26 issue has actress Michelle Phillips' account of her UFO sighting in 1969. Historical UFO reports from the 1880's and 1890's are the focus of an article in the February 2 issue. January OMNI's \"Anti-Matter/UFO Update\" column profiles Canadian researcher Chris Rutkowski (editor of SWAMP GAS JOURNAL), who had considered writing his Ph.D. thesis on the controversial \"earthquake lights\" theory of UFO origin. While Rut- kowski has apparently decided not to tackle the subject, he did find several other Ph.D. thesis dealing with UFOs. One of the better ones I've seen is Thomas E. Bullard's MYSTERIES IN THE EYE OF THE BEHOLDER, comparing historical accounts with modern UFO reports. The January and February issues of FATE contain Parts 1 and 2 of Jerome Clark's four-part series on UFO crashes. An extremely interesting article on Stealth technology and the \"UFO connection\" appears in the February issue of GUNG-HO. The author, writing under the pseudonymn of \"Al Frickey,\" goes into considerable detail about the various development pro- grams for Stealth aircraft, finally speculating that some of this technol- ogy may have been obtained from crashed UFOs. An \"Editor's Note\" at the end of the article claims that the Air Force has had an \"Alien Tech- nology Center\" at Nellis Air Force Base in Nevada for several years. As he asks, \"Do you think they are studying Mexicans?\" A retired engi- neer for Lockheed asserts that \"We have things flying in the Nevada desert that would make George Lucas drool.\" I have mentioned CALIFORNIA UFO magazine in a previous column, but there have been some changes, including the title (now just UFO), so it is certainly worth mentioning again, for those who haven't seen it. The most recent issue (Vol. 2, No. 4) con- tains articles on the Wytheville, Virgi- nia UFO flap, the work of Nikola Tesla (and modern attempts to dupli- cate/expand it), the \"quantum uni- verse\" theory, 1960's UFO/ET films, plus the usual letters, book reviews, lists of UFO organizations/publica- tions and a wide variety of other interesting features. If you have not seen any of the past issues, they are still available. A 6-issue subscription is $18.00 and, in my opinion, well worth it. The address is: UFO -1800 S. Robertson Blvd., Box 355 - Los Angeles, CA 90035. Still more booklets in Loren Gross' UFOs: A HISTORY series are now available. 1952: September-October and 1952: November-December may be ordered from Gross (690 Gable Drive - Fremont, CA 94538) for $6.00 each. All the booklets are approxi- mately 100 pages in length, illustrated and indexed. If you haven't obtained each of the booklets as they were released, check with Gross to deter- mine which ones are still available. Jacques Vallee has a new book due out in April, DIMENSIONS, pub- lished by Contemporary Books. Brad Steiger's THE FELLOWSHIP, dealing largely with contactee reports and channelled messages, has just been released by Doubleday. Paperback editions of COMMUNION, INTRUD- ERS and LIGHT YEARS are now available on newsstands. Whitley Strie- ber's TRANSFORMATION will appar- ently be published in Autumn 1988. MUFON 23"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"LOOKING BACK By Bob Gribble THIRTY YEARS AGO - March 1958: Marcio Goncalves, his girl friend, his younger brother and other friends were out driving near Ponta Poran, Brazil about 10:30 pm, (date unknown), when they spotted a bright object hanging over the thicket ahead of them. Suddenly, the UFO moved toward the group of observers and stopped directly overhead. It was larger than their car and seemed to be made of polished metal. The entire area was illuminated by a blood-red glow, and Goncalves said the hair stood up on the back of his head. The UFO appeared to be so close they could have struck it with a short pole. Goncalves started the Jeep and headed back toward town. But the UFO wasn't through playing. It fol- lowed the group, flying just behind their vehicle and about ten feet above the ground. No noise or heat came from the object. Goncalves drove at a very fast speed over the narrow, rough road. The chase lasted about fifteen minutes until the Jeep reached another thicket where the road passed through the woods. Goncalves hoped the UFO couldn't fly under the small trees. He was right. They watched the object pass behind the trees and disappear. Thinking the UFO had left the area, the group relaxed. But when they left the protection of the woods they spotted it hovering over the thicket as though it was waiting for them to reappear. The road curved toward a hill a few hundred yards away. The UFO dove at high speed, not toward the Jeep, but straight for the top of the hill, well ahead of the vehicle. Then it descended over the hill and settled to the ground in the middle of the road. The Jeep started to climb the hill, and the group was panic-stricken. The UFO had cut off their escape toward town. He could not go back. The Jeep picked up speed and the young people prepared 24 for a crash. As the car climbed the hill its headlight beams hit the UFO. To the amazement of everyone in the Jeep the object began to wobble vio- lently, then shot straight up into the air. The Jeep passed under the object, but it did not interfere with the group. After following the vehicle for another ten minutes it climbed vertically at high speed and vanished into the darkness. *** TWENTY YEARS AGO - March 1968: A series of phenomena woke residents of the Mexican states of Veracruz, Tabasco, and Oaxaca at 2:16 am on the 27th. At first the sky was flooded with brilliant light which made the night as bright as daylight. Thousands of witnesses said the bril- liance came not from one source, but from several. Seconds later a violent skyquake and earthquake hit the city of Veracruz and frightened citizens observed several UFOs descending from the sky. Instruments at the Weather Bureau station not only reg- istered an earthquake of moderate intensity at the same time in all of the three states — but its effects on the sea itself had registered. Oceano- graphers- reported that fountain-like spray churned up along the coastline of the Gulf of Mexico and witnesses claim to have seen a miniature tidal wave. The crew of the oceangoing tanker Alfa-Mex II, and their captain, Jamie Tibur Lara, observed the mys- terious objects from their ship which was about three miles out in the Gulf off Villa Rica. After his study of the strange inci- dent, Ernesto Dominguez, 51, chief of the Mexican Department of Meterol- ogy — who is considered one of the country's most knowledgeable scient- ists — said, \"This may not have been — probably was not meteors ... We do know that it did not call to earth. The trajectory (of the object or objects) was curved; imagine a jet or spaceship, if you will, suddenly going out of control and plunging directly toward the earth. Then, as if control suddenly were regained, the object abruptly veers away from the earth moments before collision.\" This was the pattern of the phenomena over Veracruz and meteors do not follow such a pattern. Chief Dominguez also remarked that when the objects came close enough to show a discernible outline — at a height estimated to be five or 10 miles above the earth — even then they appeared to be more than two yards wide. If at that great height they were visible they \"very well could have been truly enormous in size.\" He would not even guess as to their actual size or what they were. He was asked, \"What caused the earthquake, the turbulence of the sea and the tremendous roaring noise?\" The Chief replied, \"Pressure. Incalcu- lable great pressure. It, or they came near enough to the earth to exert this vast pressure, then veered away. We think the earthquake and the noise were caused when the objects were nearest the earth — about 1600 feet high. It was at this point that collision was averted and the thing or things abruptly changed course.\" In his official report in the April 1968 issue o the Department of Meteorology's Boletin Climatico, Do- minguez said that at the onset of the phenomena, temperatures lowered — but as the color of the glare changed from brilliant white to green to blue, the sensation of cold changed to one of heat. Why? No one, not even Dominguez ventured to explain this. He estimated the speed of the objects as roughly 43.47 miles a second — 2608.2 miles a minute or 156,492 miles per hour! *** FIFTEEN YEARS AGO - March 1973: \"I won't say it was a UFO, but I know I've never seen anything like it.\" That was the way Oscar Wills of Murphysboro, Illinois, a shift engineer at Grand Tower Power Station, des- cribed the object he sighted on the r"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"22nd hovering over the power sta- tion. The excitement started when Wills, who was working the 4-to- midnight shift, was informed via a tel- ephone call about 9 PM from Willis Hughes, ST., another power station employee, that \"something\" was hov- ering over the station. Hughes and his son, Willis, Jr., spotted the object from their home in the town of Grand Tower, located l l / 2 miles south of the station. Wills recalled he then went outside and saw a round object, about 25 feet in diameter, approximately 1500 feet in the air over the coal yard. He said there was a row of multi-colored, high intensity lights around approximately three-fourths of the edge of the object. The lights would alternately glow very bright and then dim. The object, which made no sound, moved over the water-intake area for about five minutes and later hovered over the 69,000-volt switchyard before fly- ing away. Wills said that about 20 minutes after the disappearance of the object, four jet aircraft made about 10 passes over the.power sta- tion, as if they were searching for the object. Editor's Note: Personal inter- view conducted by Walt Andrus on April 1, 1973 and published in the May 1973 issue of SKYLOOK No. 66 (now MUFON UFO JOURNAL). Three Los Angeles, California 18- year-olds had an experience with a \"glowing sphere\" during a trip to the beach at Point Dume on the 23rd. \"It was just incredible, really fantastic, and it came right at us,\" said Joe Cavaretta, relating the events that started about 4:30 AM. \"We'd just walked up from the beach and were standing on a plateau looking over at the Santa Monica Mountains, sort of toward Malibu Canyon. All of a sud- den we noticed this light, a kind of shining, yellowish light — like a big headlight on a car — just hanging there in the sky about at the mouth of the canyon. It was sphere-shaped and just staying there, not moving. We watched for maybe 15 minutes ... Then it started to move. We could hear the sound of low-pitched jet engines, not really revved up — just a sort of whoooshing sound.\" Caveretta said the object moved slowly out of the shadow of the mountains and turned right, heading directly for their vantage point. \"As it turned the shape changed to only a half-sphere and we could see a red light glowing in the rear of the thing,\" he said. \"It came right out over the ocean toward Paradise Cove — sort of parallel to us — then it turned to face us and started coming down. I was scared, and I said to the other guys, 'Hey, man, let's split,' and I started running for the road. But they just stood there, so I walked back.\" As the glowing sphere dropped down until it was about 1000 feet off the ground, Cavaretta said, it turned toward them and stopped. \"That's when the light flashed on and off twice,\" Cavaretta said. \"After that it turned sideways again and just flashed across the bay at an incredible speed. You just wouldn't believe how fast it moved. It headed straight for Los Angeles Harbor, and in 10 seconds it disappeared into the fog. It wasn't a balloon, or an airplane, or a helicop- ter, or a kite.\" His companions, Scott Aaland and Chris Brekke agreed with Cavaretta's descriptions. *** TEN YEARS AGO - March 1978: An enormous UFO was seen by at least 200 people within five miles of downtown Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in early March — and some observers who got a close look said the object was as big, or bigger, than a football field. Glenn Ricci and Claire Gallery were parked by a reservoir in High- land Park overlooking downtown Pitts- burgh, five miles away. Ricci \"saw a large object come out of the down- town area. It came over the reservoir and just stopped. Claire recalled: \"I was frightened ... it was right over us.\" Ricci continued: \"The underbody appeared to be a dull gray color and appeared to have a steel grating. The middle of the object seemed to be a cylinder or cone protruding from the base. Inside this cylinder were three triangular lights with a fourth one in the middle. They just kept going on and off in sequence ...\" When Claire said, \"I wish they'd come closer,\" a brilliant light ray \"came shining down.\" Ricci said, \"It lit up the car and it lit up the ground.\" Humming \"like a turbine,\" the UFO, after several minutes, moved slowly away and disappeared. The next night witnesses reported another large UFO over the Pittsburgh area. \"It would have been the size almost of a football field,\" recalled Dr. Edward Pesyna, a physician who saw the object at 9:45 PM. \"What really attracted my attention was the beam — the spotting beam. There seemed to be a ray coming down from the undersurface of the lights, just sort of scanning in a random fashion.\" The local UFO organization alone received 150 calls on the objects and \"90 per- cent of these had the same general description.\" During the week of the 19th, Bruce Buffer of West Malibu, California, was on his way to work about 4 AM when he noticed a bright circle of light above him. It seemed to be mov- ing upward but it disappeared rapidly. Then as he got into his car, he heard a low rumbling muffled sound. \"I can only describe it as a low muffled power sound, and with it there seemed to be vibrations of some kind,\" he explaind. \"Then right above me, I could clearly make out a triangular-shaped vehicle about the size of two 747's. It seemed very low, not more than three or four thousand feet. The vehicle traveled very slowly, like a helicopter hovering above, and as I watched it veered out over the ocean toward Point Dume ...\" Buffer said the object had an aura of light all around it, but there were two green lights and one red light on the points of the triangle. He estimated that he watched the object from 5 to 7 minutes.

Now is the time for each state to start making their prep- arations for this UFO public educa- tion event. The MUFON Award for the most outstanding contribution to Ufology for 1978-88 will again be presented this year at the annual symposium in Lincoln, Nebraska. David Dobbs, K8NQN in Cincin- nati, Ohio, a net control station in the MUFON Amateur Radio Net, in con- junction with Ms. Leslie Varnicle, WA3QLW in Etters, Penn., the Net Manager, have announced the forma- tion of a new ten-meter net (28.470 MHz), emergency calling times and frequencies, and are proposing new nets for the West Coast (west of the Rocky Mountains). Please refer to the published article by Mr. Dobbs to all ham radio operators and short wave listeners for details.

First he was at the scene of the Charles Whitman massacre on the University of Texas campus (1966), then he wasn't. Now he was again. Strieber talks about the publicity (and publicizing) of Com- munion, which shot straight to No. 1 bestselling paperback the first week out. Also about stepping off a New York City street curb and back into the past. Strieber on the \"visitors\": \"I don't think I was necessarily abducted aboard a 'spacecraft' by 'extraterres- trials.' Nor do I think that I had a real bad dream! Something else may have happened — I'm not sure what.\" Neither are we.

Webb MUFON Astronomy Consultant March 1988 Bright Planets (Evening Sky): Venus catches up to Jupiter on March 6, presenting observers and astro- photographers with a beautiful sight in the western early evening sky. On that night Venus, shining at magnitude -4.2, can be seen only 2° north of somewhat dimmer Jupiter (-2.1). Both planets set then around 9:30. After that, Venus sets later and later while Jupiter sets earlier each night. The crescent Moon lies below Jupiter on the 20th and below Venus the next night. Bright Planets (Morning Sky): Mars and Saturn are about 10° apart in midmonth in Sagittarius. Saturn, on the right, rises in the ESE shortly before 2 AM; Mars rises an hour later. The red planet is gradually brightening and is almost the same mag- nitude as its ringed neighbor. Partial Lunar and Solar Eclipses: On March 3 the full moon's southern edge passes through the Earth's faint outer shadow (penumbra), barely grazing the dark inner shadow (umbra). In the U.S. only Alaska and Hawaii will experience the umbral phase — and for only 13 minutes! This will occur shortly after 7 AM in Alaska and an hour earlier in Hawaii. On the 17th the same two states are blessed again with another low- altitude eclipse — this time a solar event near sunset. Alaska just misses the path of totality which passes south of the Aleutians. At Fairbanks the partial eclipse begins at 5:27 PM, reaches maximum (70%) obscuration) at 6:22, and ends just after sunset. The western Hawaiian Islands will glimpse a very small eclipse. Moon Phases: Full moon — March 3 Last quarter — March 11 New moon — March 17 First quarter — March 24 O C The Stars: That celestial sign of spring, Leo the Lion, ascends into the SE midevening sky. Look for \"The Sickle\", or a backwards question-mark, that outlines the beast's head and mane. The dot in the question-mark, the star Regu- lus, is Leo's heart. A stellar triangle east of Regulus indicates the Lion's rear haunches and tail. The Winter Circle stars and constellations, including Orion, are descend- ing into the SW. Brilliant Sirius still glimmers above the horizon in that direction."},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"MESSAGE, Continued \"Judy\" Karns, residing in Clio, Mich- igan, recently passed their Field Investigator's Examination with flying colors. Frank J. Crawford of Pierce, Idaho has accepted the responsibility of State Section Director for Clear- water and Lewis Counties. Bruce A. Widaman, State Director for Mis- souri, appointed by Mary L. Boyher, L.P.N. of Robertsville to be the State Section Director for Franklin County. Ivan White recommended that one of his colleagues, Marc Hutchins of Liverpool, be appointed State Section Director for Onondagua and Oswego Counties in New York with the approval of Gary Levine, Ph.D., State Director. When Robert D. \"Bob\" Boyd was promoted to State Director, he appointed Duncan R. Crow, J.D. of Mobile, Ala. to be the State Section Director for Mobile and and Baldwin Counties *** Interest in the abduction scenario has directly influenced the number and field of expertise of the new MUFON Consultants. Jean Mun- day, Ph.D. living in East Hampton, «New York, and Barbara G. Levy, Ph.D. in San Francisco, Calif, are new Consultants in Psychology and both are trained in hypnotherapy. Albert L. Porterfield, Ph.D., of Oberlin, Ohio and Rebeca Fernan- dez, Ph.D. in Miami, Florida have volunteered their services as Consul- tants in Clinical Psychology. Peter D. Harrison, Ph.D., who resides in Albuquerque, New Mexico, became a Consultant in Anthropology and Archa- eology and has joined the investiga- tive team of State Director, John V. Brown. Teresa Brito-Asenap, Ph.D., (abd) in Education is a MUFON Research Specialist in Albuquerque and has become involved in the New Mexico team. \"Flying Saucers - The Beginning\" is the theme for the Regional UFO Conference to be held at Eureka Springs, Arkansas on March 25 and 26, 1988, hosted by Bill Pitts and Arkansas MUFON. This will be a rare opportunity to meet and hear the men and women who were instrumental pioneers in the early days of flying saucers commencing in 1947. Nostalgia will run rampant as each of the speakers recounts and reenacts their contribution and asso- ciation with the official UFO study from the Project Sign, Project Grudge, Project Bluebook through the closing of the U.S.A.F. study in December 1969. Speakers scheduled include Dewey Fournet, Major U.S.A.F. retired, who actually wrote the \"Estimate of the Situation,\" and Al Chop, who operated the Air Force Press Desk on UFOS for the Pentagon. The motion picture by United Artists, \"Un- identified Flying Objects,\" was actu- ally \"The Al Chop Story,\" based upon Chop's experiences. Airman First Class Max Futch served as Captain Edward Ruppelt's right hand man at Project Blue Book for two years. Since Dr. J. Allen Hynek can- not personally relate his association with Project Grudge and Bluebook, Jennie Zeidman, who worked with him at Ohio State University, will dis- cuss this aspect from a personal viewpoint. Curtis Fuller, Editor of Fate Magazine was closely associated with Kenneth Arnold and Ray Palmer and will present their experiences. Other key personnel who may attend are Don Berliner, and Richard H. Hall, to report on Donald E. Keyhoe and the early days of NICAP, and Jerry Clark who will accompany Curtis Fuller to Eureka Springs for the conference. Please make room reservations direct with the Inn of the Ozarks, P.O. Box 431, Eureka Springs, Arkan- sas 72632. Telephone (501) 253-9768, being sure to mention the UFO CONFERENCE so as to obtain the special rates of $32 for a single and $36 for a double per night.

Marge Christensen, Public Rela- tions Director, will discuss her public education plans for 1988. Your Inter- national director and his wife will be attending this important meeting. We hope to see you there. Three gentlemen have been nomi- nated as candidates for the position of Central Regional Director. Nomi- nations will be received until March 31, 1988. All candidates must be nom- inated by their State Director. In addition to Bill Pitts, Arkansas State Section Director, the following have been nominated: George Coyne, along with his wife Shirley, as Co-State Directors of Michigan, have done an outstanding job in making the Michigan MUFON contingent one of the most effective and fastest growing groups in the country. George served as Assistant Chairman of the very successful and professionally managed MUFON 1986 UFO Symposium in East Lansing, Michigan at Michigan State Univer- sity. Richard P. Dell'Aquila, J.D. is a practicing attorney, living in Seven Hills, Ohio. Richard was nominated by Richard D. Seifried, Co-State Director for Ohio. Mr. Dell'Aquila is the State Section Director for Cuya- hoga County and a Field Investigator. Richard has had published articles in the MUFON UFO JOURNAL. All three candidates have expressed a serious desire to serve as the Central Regional Director, if elected to the MUFON Board of Directors. A ballot will be enclosed in the May 1988 issue of the MUFON Journal to all members in the Central state region so they may vote for their choice.

The Knowles family sight- ing in Australia on January 20, 1988 and the incredible photographic, CEI, CEIII case in Gulf Breeze, Florida commencing on November 11, 1987 and continuing into 1988 have not only attracted the attention of Ufolo- gists, but the news media as well. A preliminary report on \"The Mundra- billa Incident\" in Australia and Part I of the \"Gulf Breeze, Florida Photo- graphic Case\" are published in this issue of the MUFON UFO JOURNAL. The MUFON 1988 UFO Sympo- sium, scheduled for June 24, 25, and 26, 1988 at the University of Nebraska in Lincoln, and hosted by Nebraska- MUFON, has announced the follow- ing featured speakers: Budd Hop- kins, Marge Christensen, \"Hynek's Last Wish For Ufology\", David, M. Jacobs, Ph.D.; Jerome Clark, \"The Fall and Rise of Extraterrestrial Hypo- thesis\"; Raymond W. Boeche, \"Pub lie Reaction to Extraterrestrial Con- tact\"; and Walter N. Webb, \"Encount- er at Buff Ledge: UFO Case History.\" Additional speakers will be announced as we obtain firm commitments. We do not plan to have \"Contributed Papers\" this year as we had in Washington, D.C. at American Uni- versity in 1987. Robin Lindsey called to advise that a group from England is making reservations to attend, including Robert S. Digby, Chair- man of ICU (International Committee for UFO Research); Steuart Camp- bell (Scotland); Robin Lindsey; and a fourth party. Additional meetings will be scheduled in conjunction with the symposium: (1) Sunday morning June 26, 1988, the Annual Corporate Board of Directors Meeting; (2) State Direc- tors Meeting and others to be an- nounced later. The success of MUFON can be attributed directly to the leadership in each state and nation. Strong inves- tigative teams have been established in every state in which the State Director has communicated with mem- bers by newsletters, administered Field Investigator's Examinations, developed a rapport with police agencies to report sightings, participated in public exhibits such as \"National UFO Infor- mation Week,\" and cultivated the news media as part of our public education program. Your International Director, supported by the Executive Committee, and the Public Relations Director, has launched a program to replace State Directors and Foreign Representatives who have shown zero or little participation over the years. MUFON is a viable organization, therefore individuals who fill these important positions \"in name only,\" and have not remitted their annual dues, are not being fair to the members in their state who look to them for leadership and direction. Vacancies in these positions also occur when the State Director's employment requires that he/she move to another state, resignations, or death. *** We are proud to announce the selection of three new State Direc- tors. Jerry F. Hicrs, M.S. and a C.P.A., living in Shreveport, is the State Director for Louisiana. Jerry was the public relations member for the MUFON 1983 UFO Symposium in Pasadena, Calif. Robert D. Boyd of Mobile, Ala. was promoted from State Section Director to State Direc- tor for Alabama. Bob is also the CUFOS Investigator Coordinator. John V. Brown, B.A. plus 2 years of theology, a retired U.S. Government Police Officer and amateur radio operator N4BIR, living in Albuquerque, has enthusiastically accepted the posi- tion of State Director for New Mex- ico, replacing Dr. John Warren who moved to Washington state. Mentz D. Kaarbo, Editor of the Nordic UFO Newsletter, who resides in Bergen, has been appointed the MUFON Representative for Norway upon the recommendation of Erling Strand and Odd-Gunnar Roed. Edoardo Russo, (Doctor in Eco- nomic Sciences) living in Torino, has been appointed the Section Director for Piedmont, Lombardy, Veneti and Empilia in Northern Italy. He was recommended by Philip Mantle. Dr. Roberto Pinotti in Firenze (Flor- ence) is the MUFON Representative for Italy. Franklin A. Youri, now living in San Jose, Calif, has been reassigned as State Section Director for Santa Clara County by Paul Cerny. Michael J. Murray, LLB, a semi-retired attor- ney in Eureka, Calif, has volunteered to be the State Section Director for Humboldt County. Francis L. Ridge has appointed Garry L. Hamilton of Franklin, Ind. to the position of State Section Director for Johnson, Mor- gan and Shelby Counties in Indiana. Michael Bonecutter, a Field Investi- gator Trainee, and Artist in Corpus Christi, Tex. was appointed State Section Director for Nueces and San Patricio Counties due to the untimely death of his predecessor. Kevin R. Henke, M.S., residing in Grand Forks, N.D., is serving in the dual role of State Section Director for Grand Forks, Trail, Steele and Nel- son Counties and a Research Special- ist in Geology. Mr. Henke is employed by the University of North Dakota where their laboratory may be con- tracted to perform research in analyt- ical chemistry, such as soil samples, landing trace components, etc. (MUFON is anxious to obtain samples of the black ash deposited upon the Kno- wles Case automobile in Australia.)
