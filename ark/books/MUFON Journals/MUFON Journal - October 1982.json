FROM THE EDITOR Jim Oberg's article on false UFOs in the Soviet Union is an important contribution to IFO lore, and contains a number of lessons for UFOlogists. I would go even further and suggest that any phenomena displaying the following features should be viewed with suspicion: slow or \"majestic\" traversing of the sky oberved from a wide geographical area, smoke trails or streamers, fiery appearance and abrupt disappearance after 10-15 seconds, and \"cloud\" masses or rings spreading out in angular size. In all probability, these are caused by rocket/missile launchings, satellite re-entries, fireball meteors (larger and longer lasting than briefly visible \"shooting stars\"), or atmospheric tests involving release of chemical vapors. It is vitally important to screen out such IFOs and not clutter up the \"data base\" with them. In this issue PENTAGON INVESTIGATES CASH-LANDRUM CASE ... 3 By John.F.

Schuessler (Ed. Note: Excerpts from investigator's notes in MUFON files submitted by VISIT â€” Vehicle Internal Systems Investigative Team.) During the months that followed the 29 December 1980 incident near Huffman, Tex., where Betty Cash, Vickie Landrum, and Colby Landrum were injured while in close proximity to a large water tank-like object and a large contingent of military type helicopters, our requests for assistance from governmental officials fell on deaf ears. Bureaucratic apathy began to crack after \"That's Incredible\" aired a television segment on the case. Then Science Digest and Omni magazines published small articles that aided in getting some attention from Washington, D.C. On 24 February 1982 I received a call from the U.S. Air Force Liaison Office in Washington, D.C. The caller was Capt. Jenny Lampley. She explained that a Congressional inquiry had resulted in her assignment to determine if USAF helicopters had been involved in the 29 December 1980 case. Approximately two weeks later I learned from Richard Niemtzow at Travis Air Force Base, Calif., that Capt. Lampley had concluded her investigation and the results were negative. Supposedly, the Air Force doesn't utilize twin rotor helicopters. (That answer is questionable. The Houston Chronicle newspaper showed a photograph of a twin rotor helicopter in the 17 August 1982 issue. The caption read \"Honduran soldiers surround a U.S. Air Force helicopter during joint military exercise....\") ' On 19 March 1982 I was called by Lt. Col. George Sarran from the Department of the Army Inspector General office in the Pentagon. Col. Sarran explained that his office had received the inquiry from the Air Force Liaison Office because the Air Force had concluded their units were not involved. He explained that his interest was in the possibility that Army helicopters were involved. He would be investigating that allegation. He stressed that the U.S. Army had no opinion about the unidentified object or UFOs in general. Col. Sarran said he called because his office had been pulsed to give some answers about the helicopter involvement. At his request I provided a ' verbal account of the incident from beginning to end. He stated that he had been stationed at Fort Hood before going to Washington and was familiar with their operations. For that reason he felt that Fort Hood was probably not involved, although they have a number of twin rotor helicopters. He said their testing and operations were generally conducted on the Fort Hood reservation. He stated that as far as he knew Fort .Hood had the only helicopters of that type (CH-47 Chinook) in the area. I told him I had found CH-47s to be stationed at Ellington AFB in Houston and at the Dallas Naval Air Station and provided telephone numbers so he could check on them. He said then that it would be . his initial conclusion that if helicopters were present they surely would have been from Ellington and that would be the place for him to begin his investigation. . He had interpreted the incident to be a helicopter in trouble, landing for repairs; but concluded that didn't fit the situation because none had been reported. He had trouble accepting the Cash/Landrum concept that there was an object, probably a government experiment other than a helicopter in the air that night. He based his opinion on the fact this was the 1980 Christmas week and most military installations go on holiday routine, allowing most of the troops to go home for ..the holiday period. He then questioned the replies given VISIT investigators by the various military installations we had called. He concluded they were more or less truthful. He was very courteous and said he would try to contact Ellington. He said he'd be glad to act on any hint of a cover-up that we might find, as the Army feels it very important to have a good rapport with the community. Later the same day Col. Sarran called me a second time to let me know he had made contact with Ellington. The Commanding Officer of the 136th Transport Unit, a reserve group stationed at Ellington, and flying CH- 47s. The commanding officer was Maj. Dennis Haire. Major Haire was to call and discuss the incident with me. Col. Sarran said he had trouble convincing Major Haire he was serious. Haire obviously had never heard of the case. He said now he was even more sure that no helicopter had gone down on 29 December 1980. Also, he assured me that the CH-47s are pot flown on Monday nights. I rejected that assertion by quoting the fact that three flew from Ellington on Monday 15 March 1982, just four days before his call. He agreed there were exceptions. Maj. Haire called me on 22 March 1982. He has been a member of the Air Force detachment since 1966 and in charge since 1978. His detachment has eight CH-47A Chinooks, assigned there in 1980. Prior to that time they were a Medivac Unit. He explained the \"A\" model Chinook has 2 hours fuel plus 15 minutes contingency. Cruising speed is 110 knots, with a 135 knot maximum. They can fly non-stop to San Antonio or Austin, but must refuel at College Station if they fly to Dallas. If they go on a field exercise they schedule a 5,000 gallon USAF fuel truck to meet them along the way. Each CH- 47A takes 450 gallons of fuel for a fill-up. Maj. Haire said there are no CH- 47s in Louisiana. A contingent is stationed at Fort Sill, Okla., and many CH-47s are stationed at Fort Hood, Tex. The Fort Hood CH-47s are the (continued on next page) 3"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Pentagon, Continued \"C\" model. They can do a round trip to Houston and back without refueling. They have a 3 hour plus 30 minute contingency capacity. Maximum speed is 175 knots and cruising speed is 140 knots. He pointed out that there were no Chinooks flying in 1980 except for military units, so civilian Chinooks could not have been involved in the Cash/Landrum incident. The Ellington unit flies around the Houston control area all the time. They average 2000 hours/year/man. Fort Hood averages 900 hours/year/man. Maj. Haire is proud of his unit's record. His unit does a lot of airborne troop implacement drilling. They use the Addicks Reservoir north of Houston as a jump zone. In addition to the eight CH-47s they have four Hueys and four 58s. Maj. Haire said he was 99% sure that Ellington CH-47s were not involved in the 29 December 1980 incident. He said he could find out by looking up flight plans, aviators records, and the form 759s that document flight times. Each flight of the CH-47 requires two pilots plus an enlisted (E-6) crew chief. Sometimes a fourth person joins the crew. The Chinook can pick up and carry small equipment, but nothing real large. That would require a \"Flying Crane.\" Chinooks are not capable of joint operations â€” more than one helicopter working together to carry a large object. Helicopter pilots are very light sensitive at night and try to avoid bright objects because they ruin the pilot's night vision. For that reason he doubts that helicopters would have flown near the diamond-shaped object sighted by Cash/Landrum. They don't even turn on the inside helicopter lights until after they have landed. Major Haire also runs a commercial helicopter service at Lakeside Airport in Houston. Maj. Haire called me again on 26 March 1982. He said he had called Col. Sarran to report the results of our earlier telephone conversation. Col. Sarran is evidently digging into the case like a tiger â€” representing the Inspector General's office. Mark Charbenaugh who works with Maj. Haire, is associated with the Austin reserves and Maj. Haire with the Boeing CH-47 Chinook Helicopter Ellington National Guard CH-47 unit. Mark noted that the air maps show two microwave towers to the northeast of Houston. He questioned whether or not there could have been a microwave accident. No answer to this one. Maj. Haire said he had no idea what went on on 29 December 1980. He was definitely not involved. He felt that the government well might have some special devices, some advanced technology, or some test vehicles that could cause the reported symptoms. However, as a civilian or as a National Guard member he doesn't know of anything like that. I asked him if he had ever heard of a NEST unit operating here. He said no and he didn't even know what that acronym meant. I related that it meant Nuclear Emergency Survival Team. He drew a blank on it. Col. Sarran called again on 8 April 1982. He had talked with Capt. Richard Niemtzow at Travis AFB and with Dr. Peter Rank in Wisconsin. He understood their viewpoints, but decided to come to Houston in May to investigate for himself. He said there was nothing secret about his involvement. He said \"the Army doesn't say UFOs exist or do not exist. That is up to someone else.\" If Army helicopters were involved and it was their fault they would take responsibility. He went on to say that all reserve units are under Force Command in Atlanta. This doesn't apply to National Guard units. Col. Sarran said he was checking to see if any helicopters sprayed fuel or were involved in an agent orange type drill. He received negative replies from The Training Indoctrination Command, Testing agency at Ft. Hood, Corpus Christi NAS, Aberdeen Proving Grounds, and the Pentagon. The computer lists no activity at Huffman, Tex. on 29 Dec 1980. Col. Sarran called on 23 April 1982 to set a tentative date for his trip to Houston. He is to fact-find the claim of helicopter involvement in the Cash- Landrum case. He planned to meet with me, Vickie Landrum, Willie Culberson, and a Dayton policeman we had found who had witnessed helicopters on 29 Dec 1980. He had contacted all bases and found that none flew near Huffman on the subject date. Fort Hood only flew one helicopter. It flew to Houston, to Galveston, and back to Fort Hood by 8 p.m. On 25 May 1982 I met with Col. Sarran at the International Airport Holiday Inn in Houston. He asked me to do a taped interview relating what I (continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Pentagon, Continued  â€¢ knew about the case. I did the interview with the agreement I could also tape the whole thing. He cordially agreed. The interview lasted about 45 minutes and covered a full narrative of the incident as I knew it. .At noon on 25 May 1982 Col. Sarran and I visited Vickie Landrum in her home in Dayton. Col. Sarran was happy to have me along during the interview. Bertha Landrum, Vickie's sister, was also present. Col. Sarran told Vickie this was an official investigation and she was free to talk about it to anyone she wished. He gave her form letter type information on the Privacy Act which is to protect her; but told her he couldn't guarantee privacy. I recorded the full interview and retained the tape. A copy of the tape was sent to Peter Gersten in New York. Col. Sarran called Betty Cash in Birmingham from Vickie's house and had an unofficial fact-finding discussion with her. At approximately 1:30 p.m. Col. Sarran, Vickie Landrum, Bertha Landrum and myself went to see Dayton Police Officer L.L. Walker (his telephone is unlisted, but on file), I taped the full interview with the policeman . and his wife Marie. They observed CH-47s in the exact same area near Huffman, but 4 to 5 hours after the original incident. This time the helicopters seemed to be searching for something on the ground. They flew in groups of three with searchlights shining down on the ground. A portion of the transcript of the Walker interview describes the situation as follows: Lamar Walker says: On December the 19th my wife and I was coming back home from her Mother and Dad's who live in Plum Grove. It's about 3 miles behind Splendora into the wood area. We was travelling New Caney Road, we just came through there the cut off and hit Cedar Bayou and uh came across the river and cut down the school road at the Huffman new high school there and just got back on FM 1960. We were approximately, we was inside the Liberty county city limits and just made a turn out there by the railroad tracks on a curve, headed east. And I made a remark I said, \"Marie,\" I said. She said, \"What's that noise?\" I said \"well I don't know.\" But I said \"it sounds like helicopters and it's getting louder.\" She says \"well I don't see any airplane\" and I said \"it's not an airplane it's a helicopter, Marie,\" and she said, \"whatever it is it sure is low\" and I said \"yeah it is.\" So I rolled my car window down and there was very very little traffic and so I 'slowed way down and I started looking and and I could see some flashing lights in the air approximately anywhere from 400 to 500 feet in the air and I got to picking out more of them and as I was picking them out I picked out 3 in a victor formation and about maybe a thousand and a little bit off to the left of it was another sector of V with 3 choppers in it. And as I looked a little bit better I seen three more. The twin tops, front and aft, the shape and everything. I said well they must be on maneuvers again, National Guard or something, out at Fort Polk or the Coast Guard doing something and I looked a little bit closer and you could see some lower lights back off in the distance quite a ways back. I'd say about % of a mile â€” real good visibility that night, and uh, 1 just registered off and we went on home. And it wasn't about oh, maybe three-four weeks uh three-four days maybe a little bit longer when I heard over the news of what happened and I told Marie I said, gee whiz I even told the men around the office there. We setting around talking one day I said, \"What in the devil's all the helicopters around for?\" I said \"They have an airplane crash?\" They said, \"no, not that I heard.\" Col. Sarran said he was convinced that Officer- Walker had seen Helicopters, but it still had to be proven. Next Col. Sarran and I visited the Montgomery County Sheriff Department in Conroe, Tex. We were checking on an allegation that the Sheriff had instigated the flight of helicopters on 29 December 1980. We found that all the people in the Sheriff's Dept. had been replaced on 2 January 1981. None of the original people were around 'at the time of our visit. We spoke with Chief Deputy B.J. Grounds, Lt. Lowre, and Pete Perkins. All the people interviewed said they would not call the National Guard â€” it was not part of their procedure. They would probably call Houston police for assistance. Chief Grounds suggested we contact Carl Mangogna who was in charge of the Harris County Patrol Divison, responsible for helicopters at the time. The duty officer on 29 Dec 1980 was Gloria Eshenbeck. Later I contacted Mangogna but was unable to find Eshenbeck. Chief Grounds also suggested we visit the Army Medivac unit at Hooks Airport to the northwest of Houston. We tried but it was closed â€” all members were at a special meeting out of town. , On 26 May 1982 I called Carl Mangogna as a fpllowup to the Montgomery County Sheriff Dept. I tracked him down through his father, also a Carl Mangogna. He is now Chief of Security for a Houston corporation. He had no memory of the events on 29 December 1980. He suggested that I call Capt. Defore of the HPD. On. 26 May 1982, Chief Warrant Officer Gustafson of the Army Medivac unit called. He had done some checking at our request with other members of the unit at Hooks arid suggested the following possibilities: (a) There was a Quick React Force operating in Louisiana and Texas during the last year and a half. The last they heard of it was about 6 months earlier, operating near Morgan City, Louisiana. He said they practiced \"Iran type\" raids, operating from a small carrier in the Gulf of Mexico. Other times they haul in 5,000-gallon fuel bladders for refueling. Their operation is secret and not announced. (b) The USMC in New Orleans operates CH-46 helicopters. He doesn't know of any operation in the Houston Area but it is always a possibility; (VISIT check on the USMC unit in March 1981. No activity.) (c) Ken Defore of the Houston Police Department lives in Dayton, Tex. He will visit L.L. Walker and double check him on his claim of seeing CH-47s on 29 Dec 1980. On 27 May Chief Gustafson called with an update report. His followup with Ken Defore of the Houston Police Department was positive. Capt. Defore said he has no doubt that Dayton police officer L.L. Walker saw CH-47s. He too felt they were probably part of a Quick React Force. He said Walker saw 12 helicopters. Four Groups of three each in \"V\" formation. The lead aircraft of each \"V\" was shining a spotlight on the ground as if searching for something. Another element flew l l / 2 miles behind in a three-abreast formation. Altitude was around 500 feet. They altered course and headed for the Gulf of (continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"THE GREAT SOVIET UFO COVERUP: PART I. By James E. Oberg (Copyright @1982, James E. Oberg, all rights reserved) Russia has its UFOs, too â€” but with a difference. It has government coverups, too, and that is a central part of the difference. Cossacks in the Ukrainian countryside and sophisticated Muscovites on big city -streets have stared in awe at UFO formations passing overhead. Russian astro- nomers at mountaintop observatories have gazed in wonder at half-mile-wide crescent UFOs which silently glide across the sky. Flying along the Volga River, a commercial airliner was buzzed and circled by a UFO; the plane's engines stalled and it glided downwards, until the UFO departed and the engines restarted. Thousands of people in western port cities have run in panic as a \"jellyfish UFO\" swept over the docks, sending down shafts of light which broke windows and paving stones.. Over the Arctic Ocean, the crew of an Ilyushin airliner watched a blindingly bright UFO emit beams of light and drop cone-shaped projectiles. Similar UFO reports have come in from around the globe. The difference between these UFOs and ones seen in other countries is that in these cases the Soviet government secretly knows exactly what happened. Moscow knows where the UFOs came from,, who launched them, how they were propelled, and why they were traveling through Soviet skies. It knows all this â€” and refuses to publicly admit it. It is probably the greatest UFO coverup in history. Pentagon, Continued Mexico. They could have refueled from 5,000-gallon fuel bladders in the area or from a flattop in the Gulf. Gustafson said \"We may have uncovered a bucket. of worms.\" Col. Sarran called on 1 June 1982. He had no luck in locating a unit responsible for the helicopters on 29 Dec 1980. Only Fort Bragg, N.C., Fort Devens, Mass., Panama, and Europe have Quick React units. They weren't involved. Five CH-47s flew over Dayton on 22 May at 11 a.m. I-asked him if it would help to check and see where they were from, thus providing a clue to at least the range for operations on 29 Dec. He said it wouldn't help. Lots of units could overfly the area. Fort Hood participates in the yearly Reforger exercise and flies from Fort Hood to Port Arthur as part of the exercise. That would take them near Dayton. Col. Sarran is due to answer the original inquiry and talk to John Nyter, Deputy Head of Congressional Liaison. He said he would get back to me on the Quick React thing. He expects to report 6 \"negative findings.\" Col. Sarran called on 25 June 1982 as a last follow-up. We talked about the APRO Bulletin claim of knowing it was a government device and having evidence that would help in the case. I suggested he call Coral Lorenzen, the author of the article, since I had no idea what she was talking about. As a wrapup he told me he had contacted the lawyers at Bergstrom Air Force Base; Vickie and Betty had gone there to give testimony at the suggestion of Senators Bentsen and Towers: Vickie told Col. Sarran he should get a copy of the tape made at Bergstrom. He had gotten that tape. It revealed nothing new. He said, \"obviously something happened to trie ladies.\" However, he could find no group responsible for the helicopters. An operation of that magnitude would have been \"big time.\" Fueling would have been a problem. He just cannot believe it wouldn't have been exposed. The Special Operations Branch, Delta Project (Iran raid) and skyjack and terrorist righting groups were checked and all responded with a \"negative.''^ UFOlogy in the Soviet Union.has had its ups and downs, and it has been an enigmatic source of puzzlement to Western observers. Fifteen years ago, in 1967, a major \"UFO flap\" coincided with semi-official interest in a public investigation of the phenomenon. This came to an abrupt end early in 1968. Since then, a handful of unofficial Soviet UFO researchers has continued private investigations, without any apparent government sanction or discouragement. A series of spectacular new UFO sightings in the northern regions of European Russia in the 1977-1981 period seems to have set off a renewed low-level official interest, but the government-controlled news media continues to denounce the UFO phenomenon as nonsense. Against this background, the publication in 1979 of an official report from the USSR Academy of Sciences takes on remarkable significance, since it plainly states that the officially- denounced UFOs are \"real\" in a mathematically provable sense. This is exactly counter to the official government line. Observers wondered why .its publication was allowed at all. Translated, the title of the report was \"Observations of Anomalous Atmospheric Phenomena in the USSR: A Statistical Analysis.\" The main author was Dr. Lev Gindilis of the Shternberg State Astronomical Institute in Moscow. Data processing and bookkeeping was performed by I.G. Petrovskaya and most of the actual text was written by D.A. Menkov. Significantly, the report was approved for official publication by Academician Nikolay Kardashev, one of the USSR's top experts in SETI, the Search for Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence. For convenience the Soviet document can be referred to as the \"Gindilis Report.\" Copies of the report filtered out of the USSR along various routes (there is no evidence that the report was ever (continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"Soviet Cover-Up, Continued mentioned in the popular Soviet press). One copy, received by the French government's UFO research group, GEPAN, was subsequently forwarded to the private Center for UFO Studies (CUFOS) in Evanston, Illinois, where Dr. J. Allen Hynek passed another copy on to NASA scientist Dr. Richard Haines at the Ames Research Center in California. Haines then had it translated on a government grant, and the translated version was. then reproduced and offered for sale by CUFOS early in 1980. Due to international copyright law, NASA later printed a warning on the front of its file copies of the translation: \"This copy is for internal use of NASA personnel and any reference to this paper must be to the original foreign source:\" Access to file copies was restricted to NASA and contractor personnel. The first draft which Haines received did not carry this warning, and CUFOS made no attempts to certify copyright before publishing, thus opening themselves to the possibility of a lawsuit from the Soviet government. But such legal action is extremely unlikely, for reasons which will become clear shortly. Whatever the legal status of the document, its scientific status was allegedly very significant. Haines and Hynek, together with numerous other leading Western UFOlogists publicly claimed that the Soviet report was the long-sought key evidence for the proof of the reality of UFOs. It allegedly proved that the Soviet government, no matter what public posture it took, was really serious about genuine UFO research privately. Secondly, the statistical analysis supposedly was yet another demonstration that the \"UFO residue\" of unexp)ainable cases was demonstrably distinct from the majority of explainable cases (Identifiable Flying Objects, or \"IFOs\") within which the kernel of . useful \"true UFOs\" is hopefully buried. But the truth is that the Gindilis Report is a ruse, possibly another Soviet attempt to divert attention from the truth about Soviet UFOs. Someday the Gindilis Report may be ranked with the Piltdown Man, the Cyril Burt forgeries, the Vinland Map, and the Cardiff Giant as among the greatest scientific deceptions ever staged. Meanwhile, its publication (and wide acceptance) in the West serves the purpose for which it was written, so the publishers who pirated it are hardly likely to be punished. The key to unlocking the truth behind the Gindilis Report was found in descriptions of three spectacular multiple witness reports from the 1967 \"wave.\" These occurred on the evenings of July 17, September 19, and October 18. All occurred in the Ukraine/Black Sea/ Volga Valley/ Caucasus region of the southwestern USSR. Curiously, the bulk of eyewitness reports showed similar patterns: a \"crescent-shaped\" object proceeding on a generally west to east path. To skeptical investigators such as myself, one obvious solution hypothesis was some sort of repeated technological experiment, perhaps a new-model aircraft test or a unique type of frequently-repeated space mission. I made a quick check of space vehicle launch records and discovered a highly suggestive pattern. On each of the days of a mass sighting, a special type of Soviet spacecraft test had occurred. The vehicle was called the FOBS, or \"Fractional Orbit Bombardment System\" (that was the name given the program by the Pentagon, while Moscow insisted falsely that all of the flights were merely \"scientific satellites\" flown under the \"Cosmos\" satellite program). Moreover, according to Western space experts, the FOBS flights involved a single loop around Earth and a flaming plunge back into the atmosphere â€” and the .times and flight paths of the fiery re-entries coincided nicely with the reported times of the three mass sightings of UFOs described in the Gindilis Report. For example, the September 19th event included sightings from Svatovsk (7:20 p.m.) Zimnik (7:20 p.m.), Volzhskiy (7:30 p.m.), Novooskolsk 7:40 p.m.), Severodonetsk (about 7 p.m.), Donetsk (8:20 p.m.), Zhdanov (8:20 p.m.), Mariinskiy (about 8 p.m.), and Roy (8 p.m.). Meanwhile, the Cosmos-178 spacecraft had blasted off from Tyuratam in Kazakhstan shortly before 6 p.m., circled the planet, and was flaming its way across the southern Soviet skies at 7:30. Further correlations appeared. For the May-to-October 1967 period, there were eight FOBS flights, and seven of them appeared in the table of 1967 UFOs in the Gindilis Report. In the report, there are 56 multiple witness cases in that time period and 44 of them correlate to the dates of FOBS flights! The exact FOBS missions and the approximate times of their overflights are: Cosmos-160, May 17 at 8:45 p.m.; Cosmos-169, July 17 at 9:30 p.m.; Cosmos-170, July 31 at 9:30 p.m.; Cosmos-171, August 8 at 8:45 p.m.; Cosmos-178, September 19 at 7:30 p.m.; Cosmos-179, September 22 at 6:50 p.m. (no reports â€” it may have been overcast); Cosmos-183, October 18 at 6:10 p.m.; Cosmos-187, October 28 at 5:50 p.m. This FOBS system, by the way, had in fact been publicly flaunted late in 1965 at the annual October Revolution parade (on November 7). A TASS news agency announcer had boasted that \"the column of rocket troops ended with orbital [sic!] rockets with atomic warheads, which are capable of hitting any aggressor unexpectedly, after making one or more orbits around the earth.\" These missiles were code- named the SS-10 \"Scrag\" by Western military analysts â€” and may have been a ruse, since when FOBS test flights began they were atop SS-9 \"Scarp\" missiles. The \"Scarp\" itself was unveiled late in 1967 with the threat that they could \"deliver to target nuclear warheads of tremendous power. Not a single army in the world has such warheads. These rockets can be used for intercontinental and 'orbital launchings.\" A typical FOBS flight involved launch from the Tyuratam test range east of the Aral Sea in Soviet Central Asia. The two-stage missile placed a two-ton payload into a low but stable orbit 100 miles above Earth's surface. An hour and a half later, near the end of its first pass around the globe, the payload turned tail forward and fired a powerful braking ' engine which deflected it out of orbit and toward the ground. In the 6 minutes before impact (continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"Soviet Cover-Up, Continued onto a target zone east of the Volga River, the gradually descending warhead crossed over Athens, Istanbul, and the northeast coast of the Black Sea â€” where thousands of unsuspecting citizens were suddenly treated to a spectacular light show in the evening sky. One graphic description of such an apparition appeared in an article in \"Soviet Life\" magajine in February 1968. What was really happening was that Cosmos-171, allegedly a \"scientific satellite\" but actually a test thermonuclear warhead space-to- ground delivery system, was diving into the upper atmosphere on its way to a touchdown point east of Kapustin Yar. What the shock wave looked like to astonomers near Kislovodsk in the Caucasus Mountains was this: It was shaped like an asymmetrical crescent, with its convex side turned in the direction of its movement. Narrow, faintly luminous ribbons resembling the condensation trail of a jet plane followed behind the horns of the crescent. Its diameter was two-thirds that of the moon, and it was not as bright. It was yellow with a reddish tinge. The object was flying horizontally in the northern part of the sky, from west to east, at about 20 degrees above the horizon. A bright star of the first magnitude was moving at a constant distance ahead of the crescent. As it moved away from the observers, the crescent dwindled, turned into a small disk, and then suddenly vanished. According to Zigel's account, \"The mysterious object was seen by ten of the station's scientific workers; it was also observed in Kislovodsk.\" Zigel's article was about \"True UFOs\"and this case was featured as one of his best unsolved apparitions on record; it was later listed in the Gindilis Report, too. These cases appeared in Western UFO books of that period, too. The Caucasus 'apparitions, for example, were described as flying saucers hundreds of yards in diameter. The Soviet \"giant spaceships\" even rated a chapter named after them in Donald Keyhoe's 1973 book Aliens From Space. The usually highly regarded Keyhoe painted a scene at the Kazan Observatory (on the lower Volga River) CAUCASUS MOUNTAINS CASPIAN SEA Observation points of July 17,1967 FOBS/Cosmos-169 re-entry with groundtrack superimposed (from Gindilis Report, Fig. 20) at twilight on July 18, 1967: Suddenly a huge flying object appeared, moving swiftly across the sky. As it passed the observatory its orange glow made it easily visible in the dusk. It was an amazing sight â€” an enormous crescent-shaped craft at least eight times larger than any known airplane. The horns of the crescent were pointed backward, emitting jetlike exhausts....Confirmation of the giant spaceship's existence soon came from other astronomers. The diamter of the flying crescents were [sic!) between 500 and 600 meters (between 1640 and 1840 feet...) Several times, Soviet astronomers had reported that the huge spaceships were preceded or flanked by smaller UFOs which kept precise formations, matching the crescents' terrific speeds. Keyhoe was, as it turned out, giving a severely garbled account of the Cosmos-169 reentry, suitably embellished from his own imagination to force the observations to conform to his own biases about \"giant spaceships\" and \"intelligent piloting.\" The embellishment may well have been subconscious and sincere on Keyhoe's part, but the result was a clear falsification of the .actual eyewitness testimony â€” a demonstrably common occurrence in popular UFO books, when published accounts can as in this case be compared to documented prosaic stimuli. Read Keyhoe's passage again for the subtle insertion of counterfeit clues about how he wants the \"raw evidence\" to be (mis)interpreted: a \"craft\" with horns \"emitting exhaust,\" with smaller UFOs in \"precise formation\" (of course, actually these were randomly\" scattered pieces of burning debris!). Keyhoe (and all other Western UFOlogists) had had all the clues they needed to solve this case, but those who used the cases in their publications chose not merely to overlook the clues but also to distort them sufficiently to make them almost useless to anyone else. The Gindilis Report contained three tables listing various descriptions of some other spectacular flaming FOBS re-entries. Although most of the witnesses listed the motions correctfy (continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"Soviet Covcr-Up, Continued (while incorrectly giving the time, often by more than an hour), a few imaginatively described the false \"UFO\" as \"hovering\" or \"curving.\" One air crew, on the Voroshilovgrad-to- Volgagrad flight number 104, insisted that the UFO had hovered and then maneuvered around their plane (air crews are often touted as \"trained observers\" but in fact they can be, as in this case, often among the least accurate observers of UFOs; to my recollection, Dr. J. Allen Hyriek has reported this finding and this conforms to my own investigative experience.) A more sensational aspect of this sighting was omitted by Gindilis but did appear in the original sources: the plane's engines allegedly died and did not start up again until after the UFO had disappeared, when the aircraft was only half a mile high. But it was only Cosmos-178 coming home. The significance of this FOBS/UFO correlation became clear. More than 80% of the FOBS flights caused mass UFO sightings; almost 80% of the UFO sightings of the period of interest in 1967 were evidently caused by FOBS space missions; a full three quarters of the total number of UFO reports analyzed by the Gindilis Report were from 1967! So the official Soviet statistical study's results are hopelessly polluted by non-UFO data (i.e, the FOBS sightings) and hence are totally worthless as information about \"true UFOs\" and their reputed \"stable statistical properties\" â€” which the authors and the Western reviewers boasted about. Computer experts have .a saying: \"Garbage In, Garbage Out.\" The Gindilis Report by this definition is garbage, and a lot of UFOlogists eagerly swallowed that garbage. It should leave a bitter taste in their mouths! Now, what might have been the real motivations of the authors of the report, and of Gindilis in particular? Did they naively think that they were working with genuine UFO raw data, or did they know that their data base was hopelessly compromised but that it was better for military secrecy that people still thought of the FOBS entries (which the Soviet government denies ever ti a a j , 2 xâ€” c: LL O C 3 c c o o c L 4 1 H 137 ua ipr ma | \\ H  C?

ALL THE BIGGEST CASES CORRESPOND TO SECRET MILITARY SPACE ACTIVITY, AS LABELED EITHER. FOBS (FRACTIONAL ORBIT BOMBARDMENT SYSTEM) OR PLESETSK, took place) as \"flying saucers\"? It is easy to see that official Soviet censors would have initially welcomed the public misidentification of the FOBS entries. After all, officially, space systems such as the FOBS were illegal and hence the USSR would never test them. In fact, since the FOBS system was readily recognized in the West as an orbital H-bomb carrier best suited for nuclear sneak attack, the less the world knew about it, the better for Moscow's public peace posturing â€” especially following the writing of a 1967 treaty outlawing the placement of H- bombs in orbit (which is exactly what the FOBS was designed to do). Despite the fact that Moscow sanctimoniously signed the treaty later that year, it o continued to test FOBS vehicles (now outlawed by international law) long afterwards. But these flaming UFO sightings in 1967 had ignited tremendous public interest in the Soviet Union. Up until that point, the Soviet population had been relatively insulated from the flying saucer phenomenon, which for 20 years had been exciting enthusiasts in the United States, France, South America, Japan, and to a lesser extent elsewhere in the world. Officially, Soviet commentators had denounced the topic as a product of capitalistic war hysteria and money-grubbing yellow journalism. By late 1967, however, the ' hundreds of thousands of new witnesses eager to make up for lost time, official Soviet policy had changed â€” briefly. In Moscow, a group of UFO enthusiasts organized a private study committee. The chief mover evidently was Feliks Zigel, an .astronomy professor at the Moscow Aviation Institute. A retired general, Porfiriy Stolyarov, was chosen chairman, and it is by that name (\"the Stolyarov Committee\") that the group is known. After a series of very successful public meetings, the group was invited to appear on Moscow National Television on November 10. There, they invited watchers nationwide to send in reports of UFO sightings for scientific analysis. It is primarily from that body of reports that 10 years later the Gindilis team selected 256 most typical for analysis. So by late 1967 the Soviet government was faced with the uncomfortable prospect of its citizens scanning the skies and reporting all strange lights they saw â€” and all with official approval. Yet many of these lights were being caused.by activities Moscow did not want to acknowledge. What started out as an ill-considered (\"continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"Soviet Cover-Up, Continued but apparently harmless pandering to public curiosity now must have seemed to be getting out of control. It wasn't just the FOBS spaceshots that needed coverups. The top secret new military satellite center at Plesetsk north of Moscow had opened the year before for polar-orbit spy satellites. Sooner or later, one was bound to be launched in twilight when, its unlit rocket exhaust plumes would stand out like a torch in the sky. With the sanctioned UFO mania sweeping the USSR, such reports were bound to be published widely, betraying strong hints about the hitherto concealed existence of the military space center. And that is exactly what happened on December 3, three weeks after the televised UFO appeal. The Cosmos- 194 Vostok-class spy satellite blasted off from Plesetsk at 3 p.m. local time, shortly before sunset. As it rocketed northeastwards along the Arctic coastline, its contrails were visible to eyewitnesses in the wintry night below. It became (and to this day remains) another great Russian UFO; it is known as the \"Kamennyy UFO\" since it was spotted from an aircraft on route from \"Mys Kamennyy\" (Cape Stoney) in the New Siberian Islands to Moscow. A graphic account of the \"UFO\" was given by American UFOlogist William L. Moore (author of The Roswell Incident) in his study, \"Red Skies: A History of UFOs in Russia\" (UFO Report, June 1980), based on casebooks compiled by Zigel. Wrote Moore: Among the most interesting [1967 cases] is a curious multiple sighting on December 3, of an unknown object near Cape Kamennyy in the Soviet Arctic. At 3:04 p.m. several crewmen and passengers of an IL- 18 aircraft on a test flight for the State Scientific Institute of Civil Aviation sighted an intensely bright object approaching them in the night sky at an altitude of 2,800 feet (in this far northern latitude, night comes in midafternoon in December). â€¢ At first those aboard the IL-18 thought this object was an aircraft with landing lights on, but as the flight commander maneuvered and the object followed, it soon became apparent that it was not an aircraft. As the object approached above and to the left of the IL-18, the powerful beams of light 10 emanating from the object illuminated the entire horizon. In addition, several cones of light seemed to descend from the object to the ground. \"When it practically came up to us, it was quickly extinguished in 3 seconds and these bright cones continued to shine independently for several more seconds and then were extinguished slowly\". All during this observation and for another 10 minutes until the object disappeared into the distance, radio contact was maintained with the dispatcher services for both Cape Kamennyy and Vorkuta, both of which could also see the mysterious object but were unable to identify it. Many typical symptoms of airborne UFO testimony can be identified in this account. The air crew incorrectly thought the \"UFO\" was following their maneuvers and approaching very close (Cosmos-194 was doing neither). The \"beams of light\" were characteristic of such Plesetsk launchings and would be seen again and again by witnesses of similiar launchings in the future. The descending cones of light were almost certainly the four jettisoned first stage strap-on boosters trailing smoke; the sudden fade-out of the main light may have been the cutoff of its engines,, or more likely when it flew into Earth's shadow a hundred miles up. .[The location of the aircraft during the UFO encounter can be estimated by the fact that it was about 4 hours out of Moscow on its flight back from Mys Kamennyy. The IL-18 has a cruising speed of about 380 m.p.h. and assuming it was on a great circle route that would put it not far from Vorkuta and a bit north of the Cosmos-194 launch trajectory.] Ironically, Moore boasted that \"ZigePs reports tend to be limited to those UFO cases that have managed to withstand the most rigorous scientific investigation\" â€” but a simple comparison of the time and flight path of the \"Kamennyy UFO\" with the launch time and trajectory of Cosmos- 194 (data was published a few months later in numerous international space magazines) was never done, neither by Zigel nor by Moore, nor even by the Gindilis team, which listed the \"Kamennyy UFO\" as one of the most spectacular multiple witness \"true UFOs\" of the year. For Soviet security organs, the Kamennyy UFO reports (which were widely published soon afterwards) were highly undesirable. First their secret FOBS tests and now their secret Plesetsk spaceport were being compromised by the naive UFO enthusiasm sweeping the country. The last straw must have been in February 1968 when Zigel published his UFO article containing a precise technical description (albeit unrecognized as such) of the officially nonexistent FOBS warhead re-entry masquerading as a flying saucer. Censors may have realized that such details could easily serve to draw unwanted attention to the FOBS flights. So a few weeks later a new Soviet UFO policy was abruptly unveiled: no more published reports of UFOs (FOBS or Plesetsk or otherwise) since it was all \"nonsense.\" But in fact, just the opposite, must have been the anxiety gnawing at Soviet news censors: too much sensible UFO discussions might really expose the FOBS explanations or the Plesetsk activity. The Stolyarov Committee was disbanded and Zigel was told to drop the topic of UFOs. So the lid was clamped down and the FOBS/UFO connection went unrecognized in the public literature for 15 years.

Because of the RAAF's committment to checking out defence implications in reports, those events outside their brief merely go unresolved. Space allows us only mention of a small selection of cases: On April 4, 1975, following ground observations, a pilot of an aircraft approaching Cairns airport from the west was asked by the tower to look out for an unidentified object to the north: VHP contact CS Tower was severely distorted prior to receiving the message of a foreign object in the area. A light only was visible â€” not the usual aircraft light (landing) but quite powerful with a yellow colouring, with a wide beam. For several seconds it would oscillate through 10Â° to 15Â° of horizontal and vertical planes gently, but mainly appeared stationary. The vertical oscillation appeared to move in an arc, as if off-centre of the longitudinal axis of an aircraft. The source of light was not visible unless pointing directly towards the observer, appearing then with a lens approximatley 3 times diameter of a Boeing 727 landing light lens. During the last observation, smoke, cloud or some opaque substance appeared in the beam. It appeared somewhat darker and denser than cloud. Cockpit duties terminated the observation. The RAAF investigating officer indicated that the light was no known aircraft in flight and was \"not completely satisfied that the object described by....the pilot, was the planet Saturn.\" However it is Saturn that appears in the 1975 Summary as \"a possible cause\"! On August 30, 1975, the pilot and co-pilot of an RAAF Neptune aircraft transiting up the Queensland coast at 3,000 feet, just out to sea off Mackay, North Queensland, witnessed a group of 3 lights which passed in front of them. The lights were about the same intensity as average stars and were moving horizontally at high angular velocity. They appeared to be at the same altitude of the aircraft. Fearing an imminent collision, the pilot banked to the left \"and commenced climbing as the lights passed down the starboard side of aircraft. The lights appeared to disappear into cloud abeam the cockpit.\" Duration approx. 10 - 15 seconds. \"Nil radar traces noted by 10SQN aircraft radar operator.\" The investigating officer confirmed that \"both men are reliable and trained observers\" and the case is listed as \"not known.\" Possibly the most interesting of the aircraft sighting reports from the RAAF files was a complex of events played out near Brisbane and Coolangatta, Queensland, on the night of November 4, 1976. The events are not mentioned in the 1976 Summary. The Senior Area Approach Controller, Brisbane Airport, directed details of the, evening's events to the Orderly Officer at Amberley Air Force Base. The accounts were in turn passed onto the Intelligence Liaison Officer at Canberra. The first report was made by the Duty Controller at Coolangatta Tower. At 1900 hours he observed a stationary light changing back and forth from red to .green (possibly scintillation - B.C.). The controller dismissed the object as \"unknown, possibly a star\" and took no further interest. But things were soon hotting up considerably. The crew of an Electra transport aircraft observed an object maintaining station with them. The object again appeared as a light changing between green-red-green, but after it appeared to move up and down in its position, the UFO departed to the south at approximately 1% times the speed of the Electra. The captain wrote: The object was first thought to be an RAAF A/C with afterburner on doing aerobatics but when seen to move in vertical zig-zag patterns, (it) could not possibly have been. (It) moved relative to stars â€” below horizon. At first speed was slightly greater than ours then increased to approx. 100%. Then in the last few minutes incr(eased) rapidly to many times our speed. Brisbane radar ostensibly did not confirm the \"unknown.\" I have since interviewed the Captain of the Electra and it would seem that something quite extraordinary took place that night! Shortly after, the pilot of a light aircraft â€” a Piper Aztec â€” sighted a red and green object maintaining station with him for 4 minutes before fading from view. Both Brisbane Radar and the Meteorology Radar at Eagle Farm then began picking up unidentified returns that were stationary to the East of Brisbane. The Met Radar picked up two returns in close proximity, painting about the same size as an aircraft. One tracked south and faded, the other went north and descended to 10,000 feet. It was on radar for some time. The RAAF report notes: \"The Met radar operator likened the movement to that of a ship but said they had never painted ships before in his many years of experience at BN (Brisbane - B.C.).\" The RAAF report ex Amberley concluded: The red-green object visually sighted has been assessed as most probably the planet Venus; the colours etc being caused by atmospheric conditions. Weather on the night of the sighting was clear with no cloud. The radar contacts could have been caused by ducting of the radar energy painting ships at sea (a \"not altogether satisfactory explanation,\" the officer later wrote â€” B.C.). DOT has confirmed that they had no civil traffic in any of the relevant areas. There was no military activity. (continued on next page) 11"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"RAAF, Continued Shades of Kaikoura! 10 . The Electra pilot finds such explanations, understandably, most unsatisfactory. Further investigation suggests that a commercial passenger aircraft bound for Cairns was paced by a UFO that night, and that a ground observer at Boona, west of Brisbane, also reported a sighting 11 . The Intelligence Officer who submitted the following report to Canberra was really just \"whistling in the wind\" when he suggested an explanation for a close encounter with a UFO on the ground, on November 11, 1977, in the Barossa Valley. He wrote: \"My guess is that it was a set of orange reversing lights, probably on the rear of a large American car.\" (!! â€” B.C.). The report did not find its way into the 1977 Summary. A West Australian couple were camped on a roadside between farms, off Seppeltsfield Road and about % of a mile in from the Nuriootra (sic? â€” B.C.)/Tanunda Roads. The male witness recorded the event in his diary from which I quote: It was the 2 square orange lights with a band of glowing gold light straight across the top. Then the 2 orange lights seemed to merge (almost) into (each other), then back to squares with a dark object crossing one of them, just like a person across a window. Later 2 red spots (one in each orange square) just like an exhaust. Later it all went out like a light and then I saw a pale glow as if it was moving across the field. It appeared to be 200/300 feet away, the gold light 40' wide and 2' deep, the orange squares 3' to 4' square. After about 25 seconds I called (his wife â€” B.C.) to watch it. She came out of the van Her story follows: Outside in the near distance between trees each .side of the track there appeared to be an object which seemed to fill the space between these same trees....After viewing this strange set of lights for a few seconds, everything went black, as if a switch had been turned off....Then in a westerly direction across the skyline at the top of the field, there appeared a pale blue-grey light, wide at first, then gradually and fairly quickly moving west and diminishing in size like a ribbon of light, narrowing as it finally faded out. Her husband described the end of the observation as follows: 12 Area went black and one or two seconds later a bluish/grey ribbon of light flowed horizontally across the field in a west direction and gradually faded out. Although there were no RAAF file holdings on the widely reported â€¢ Frederick Valentich disappearance incident, 1978 was a bumper year, the Summary for that year listing 118 reports. Space precludes me from describing too many, but briefly some of the highlights were an extraordinary phenomenon seen in a cane field east of Mandurana, Queensland, for 3 hours on December 6th; a \"UFO sighting\" by erew of HMAS Adroit on April llth; an apparent \"electromagnetic\" case north of Goulburn, NSW, on October 22nd, which left the speedometer indicator broken, and a \"daylight disc\" seen near Laverton Air Force Base on December 27th. A taxi driver in Wavell Heights, Aspley, Queensland, almost touched a UFO, on the night of October 10,1978. At about 10 p.m., while driving through Spence Road, he saw \"a very bright, white object (lit up from the inside, no lights on the outside).\" It looked like a mini-bus, moving from my right side across the front of me to the left. I thought it was going into a garage. At this time it was 60 metres ahead of me. When it came in front of my headlights, I saw it had no wheels. I stopped my car about 2 metres from it. Then I got out of my car and watched it as it pas(sed) by slowly. It was lit up inside and outside extremely brightly â€” a white metallic colour. It had a driving seat, instruments and T-shaped steering wheel. I couldn't see any light fittings inside or outside. In fact it was moving so slowly that I tried to touch it. It was at this time that I heard a sort of s.s sss noise and the lights went out. It speeded up and quickly disappeared. The sighting lasted about 30 seconds. I recently spoke to the witness and confirmed the account as given in the RAAF report. He did elaborate for me on the one provocative detail missing from the report â€” a driver for the \"mini- bus\" UFO. There was none! Another \"unknown\" was observed by 2 women driving on the Heathcoate Road between the weir and the Menai turn-off, at about 9:30 p.m. on October 29,1978. It was first observed some 500 feet away at about the same altitude. Barossa Valley, 1977 Aspley, 1978 Heathcote Road, 1978 The object was shaped like two saucers on edge, but essentially a very large dark disc shape. It had what appeared to be four or five portholes. Light was coming from these, although one had \"something in the way\" â€”a shadow or silhouette? Two lights like spotlights were directed downwards from the UFO. When the couple stopped their car, the object moved about 100 feet towards them. It stopped briefly, then moved closer, a further 50 feet. It finally moved a further 50 feet, stopped very briefly and then flew off towards Engadine. On January 7, 1979, at Redhead, NSW, a 10-year-old girl was woken up by an extraordinary display. At about 4 (continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"RAAF, Continued p.m. a very bright white circular object, with a small circular piece attached in the centre, first appeared then stopped. A second object approached from behind the first, circling and then stopping alongside it. The first object then took off again, stopped. The second object repeated the above movement. This motion continued on back and forth for some 30 minutes, as the objects moved in a north-south direction. Both objects appeared to stop, side by side, over the neighboring garage. Four beams of misty white light came from the objects to the ground and lit up the area \"like midday\" for a period of approximately 10 minutes. The beams finally went out and both objects disappeared from view in the north-northwest. The child had watched the whole display from her bed by a window, for some 100 minutes, too frightened to call her parents. After the objects had gone, the girl told her parents. She was visibly shaken by the experience and her mother had to sleep with her for the remainder of the night. The girl slept with her father for the following two nights. This small selection more than adequately confirms the impression that although the majority of cases investigated by the RAAF are misidentifications of prosaic phenomena, their files do hold valid \"unknowns\" that deserve further investigation. However the RAAF ostensibly lack the facilities and/or the inclination to conduct worthwhile investigations of these provocative events. Is there a cover-up? The question as to whether the RAAF is \"covering-up\" its UFO investigation a difficult one to resolve to everyone's satisfaction. The 1966 internal Defence Minute Papers specifically address themselves to this point. References in them are difficult to reconcile with a \"cover-up\" scenario: ....We only foster the incorrect (but nevertheless widely held) belief that we -have much vital information to hide. Three of these files are classified, two of which are secret although there appears to be nothing on the files consistent with this classification. These quotations seem to refer to a situation other than a sophisticated cover-up program. While there are a large number of provocative claims which are suggestive of cover-up activities, this report is addressed to the files examined by the author during January 1982. As already stated, I was permitted a completely open review of the RAAF/Department of Defence UFO files made available to me. The existence of self critical and provocative data in the RAAF documents I was able to examine directly, at Canberra, is a powerful argument that the RAAF is quite open about their UFO investigations, at least within the normal limits of typical government bureaucracy. Further still, the fact I was allowed such a direct on- site review of the files and that further such reviews by myself of the remaining files are being organised, are significant items of evidence for an open policy rather than support for a \"cover-up\" scenario. It is also significant that my officially sanctioned file review event took place prior to the imminent promulgation of the Freedom of Information Act. The wording of the Australian Act is such that a high-level \"cover-up\" program would be ensured its permanency, and at worst would be only exposed with ambiguous, fragmentary disclosures. Finally the idea of a high level \"cover-up\" program seems a little inappropriate in a situation where even the authority invested with the responsibility of carrying out the program seems somewhat disabled by an inability to satisfactorily organise and locate its own files on the matter (a problem, which I might add, is shared by many civilian UFO research groups). Conclusion It would probably seem that a whole new vista of openess on the part of the RAAF has unfolded. Prior to my visit, an officially sanctioned review of government UFO files by a private UFO researcher would have seemed inconceivable. However, the door has finally been opened and left ajar. This preliminary review indicates that the RAAF are probably as confused and uncertain, as many civilian research groups, on what to do about provocative UFO sightings. The RAAF have been locked into a bureaucratically orchestrated responsibility, which, the reviewed files suggest, has long since been determined to be a waste of time, but is continued as a service to the general public. In the main, the RAAF UFO investigations have served their publicly stated purposes. That is, they may have allayed possible fear and alarm by the general public and satisfied the government that there is no apparent defence implications. However, based upon my review of the RAAF UFO files during January 1982, past research into RAAF investi- gations, my own investigations of UFO reports and those of other individuals and groups, there is a residue of provocative reports that survives the gauntlet of both official and civilian investigation. I believe it is time that the RAAF went beyond its current limited brief, which leaves its small residue of \"unknown\" or \"unexplained\" reports unresolved. I think it is time for the RAAF to abandon its \"unnecessarily rigid and unimaginative\" approach (to quote and abridge DPR's submision to DAFI in 1966) and openly co-operate and support the efforts of those civilian groups that research and investigate UFO sighting reports in a responsible and scientific way. The Australian Centre for UFO Studies 12 promotes this sort of approach. It recognises that the RAAF has expertise appropriate to evaluating part of the phenomena generally regarded as \"UFOs,\" - however, the Centre and many of its sister organisations overseas have the capacity to enlist and direct meaningful investigations of the residue of reports that the RAAF seemingly prefers to ignore. The satisfactory resolution of the UFO controversy could.be assisted if official and responsible civilian groups alike, co-operated more closely.

In reading through newspaper articles on such subjects as advances in medicine, space research, astronomy, etc., one gains the impression that the reporter at least tried to get the facts straight. The articles may be written in oversimplistic lay language at times, but in general the information is understandable and accurate. Major mistakes are few. As far as TV documentaries and the like are concerned, in regard to the same subjects, one is left with the impression that they were done with the help and permission. of the authorities quoted within. Not so UFOlogy. Since the beginning of the modern period of UFOs (1947), the presentations of the subject have been a mixture of misrepresentations and mistakes â€” a mishmash too often sprinkled with generous doses of fantasy and nonsense. The reason for this might lie in the fact that the subject itself is a mystery. No one, not even the most knowledgeable researchers, know what UFOs are. Only theories and facts about particular reports are available for the researchers to study. The information which trickles down to reporters in various media is generally a watered-down version. But even considering this difficult communi- cation problem, why is present media reporting so unsatisfactory? Having been active in the field since 1957 (and intensely interested since 1945), it is my impression that the persons most knowledgeable in the field are seldom permitted to have any degree of control over the copy or scripts which eventually make up the finished products. The one exception to this is books, where a satisfactory number of knowledgeable researchers have been able to get books with accurate information printed. Why this disturbing situation with RAAF, Continued way, that residue of provocative reports we label \"unexplained\" may eventually be resolved as something prosaic or even something much more interesting.

Box 546, Gosford, NSW, 2250, Australia. media mismash exists is as puzzling to me as is the mystery of the UFOs themselves. For among the numerous expert researchers today are persons skilled in writing, research, script- writing, and film production. The reason for bringing up this situation at this particular time is that recently the problem presented itself in .the Los Angeles area in an unprecedented way. The latest problems began with the opening of the moving, \"ET, the Extraterrestrial.\" Michael London, a writer on the Calendar section of the Los Angeles Times newspaper asked me to help him collect a group of close-encounter witnesses in the area, especially those who had interacted with UFO \"occupants.\" His idea was to take the group to a showing of \"ET\" to gain their impressions as to how their own experiences contrasted or correlated with those of the characters of the film. At the time he called, I was frantically trying to finish preparations for a research trip to Ireland on a psychic archeology project that has engaged huge chunks of my time since 1977, and I did not actually have time to give London on this article idea. But in discussing the situation with him on the phone, I learned that he had no other way of contacting documented close encounter witnesses. On his own, he had succeeded only in contacting members of what is referred to as the lunatic fringe, who abound in Southern California. I decided that, for the good of the cause, I had to help him. I referred six rational, productive persons to him who live in the Los Angeles area and who seem to have had valid CE III and CE IV experiences. The resultant viewing and discussion of the film \"ET\" was excellent, and in general, London (continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"California Report, Continued managed to write a fairly accurate account of the various experiences of the witnesses. The article proved useful to UFOlogy and seemed helpful to the reading public in understanding and accepting the UFO phenomenon called \"close encounters.\" The few factual errors in the article were mostly in the discussion of the Bailey case. As readers of this column are aware, Rev. Harrison E. Bailey is a Baptist associate minister in Pasadena, Calif. Not only was he a reported CE III witness in 1951, but on November 1, 1978 he produced sixteen Polaroid prints which he states were taken during a visit by two unknown (UFO?) entities into his apartment in the dead of night. Three and one-half years have been put into constant study on these photos, by myself and by anyone else I can get to study them. The input of several photographic experts have led me to think that the photos are not hoaxed and are probably genuine. However, they do not seem to depict a visit by physical UFO beings, but instead are images of an unexplained manifestation, heavily tinged with parapsychological implications. The manifestation (entities?) do seem, however, to be posing as UFO beings, at least in their interaction with Rev. Bailey. Rev. Bailey was one of the persons I chose to introduce to Michael London, since he is a productive, intelligent, and articulate member of society, and I personally feel his integrity is unquestioned. When the Bailey experience broke into print in Michael London's Los Angeles Times article, Pandora's box lost its latch. Immediately, media persons of all descriptions began to ring the phone requesting more information and interviews. However, the combination of stress from the preparations for the trip to Ireland, heavy and unexpected family responsibilities, and the added UFO work caused by the Times article had flattened me out, and as a result I could not even answer the phone for two weeks. I arrived in Ireland finally, where the research went well, though it was accomplished at half steam. Upon returning home, I continued to receive calls from media personnel about the Bailey case. One of them was a man (I will not call him a gentleman) with an. English-accent who stated that he worked for the \"North American News Service\" and wished to interview Bailey and myself for a story to be syndicated in English and German publications only. He spoke a good piece and seemed to understand my position that we were not out after publicity but that the reasons we wished to put out the story were threefold: 1. that it might shake loose similar pictures from other witnesses who had not had the courage to bring forth such inexplicable material; 2. that such coverage would hopefully bring about funding from some media source for image enhancement of the Bailey photos 1 ; and 3. that such media sources might help in funding planned photo sessions in Rev. Bailey's apartment with the hope of obtaining more images on film (infrared, videotape, or otherwise) under controlled conditions and with other reputable witnesses present. The man with the accent agreed that he would ask his editor about the above conditions. He spoke as if his editor were in England and that he himself was a mere visitor to the Southland. He stated he thought his editor could make it possible to have the photos enhanced. Subsequently, Bailey and I gave him a complete interview, covering the entire range of Bailey's experiences. In addition, I projected in slide form all sixteen of Bailey's photos, explaining painstakingly the paranormal features, emphasizing the. slides where image enhancement would be most useful. 2 The man left very pleased, but with no photos, for Rev. Bailey had not brought his originals with him. In the space of time between our first meeting and his planned subsequent meeting with Bailey in order to borrow a picture or two to illustrate his article, I learned quite by accident (or synchronicity?) that the reporter was a freelance writer who wrote for the National Enquirer. Fully three weeks before his first call to me, he had \"put in a lead\" to the Enquirer suggesting the Bailey photos as an article after obtaining the idea from the Times article, and had had his lead approved. There is no doubt that during his interview with us he was deliberately deceiving us, pretending he was interested in the scientific aspects of the situation and repeatedly stating his article, would be for the European markets only 3 . After learning his true colors, we immediately shut off all communication with him and the number of photos he obtained from us for use with his article was zip. Later we learned, form our secret sources, that he had gone ahead and written a simple article of about 300 words concerning Bailey's experience, with no mention of the years of scientific study which had been poured into the case. In fact, his story said Bailey's attempts to photograph the strange manifestations (entities) proved unsuccessful! He was evidently trying to cover his tracks with the Enquirer's editor, because he had been refused use of the photos. Instead he concentrated on a description of a session in Bailey's apartment where we had enlisted the aid of a talented psychic as an experiment. Our purpose was to try to see if this psychic, Anita Furdek, could help produce any manifestations which our cameras,.as well as Rev. Bailey's, could photograph. No .manifestations (visible) occurred and no photographs were obtained, but Ms. Furdek apparently reached psychically toward whatever had caused Bailey's Nov. 1, 1978 photo session and succeeded in persuading it to stop frightening the minister. For since the session, Rev. Bailey's attitude toward the phenomenon has changed from terror to objective curiosity, and he has since produced three series of'inexplicable, apparently paranormal photos. These, however, have even more paranormal implications than the original set, and do not relate in any logical way to UFO phenomena. Hearing of the Enquirer story, and after fighting off repeated attempts by one of their photo editors to persuade Rev. Bailey to permit use of one or two of his photos .to illustrate the Englishman's inaccurate story, Rev. Bailey and I have tried every way we can to see that the story, as written, is at (continued on next page) 15"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"LETTER Project Identification Editor, If the attacks on Mark Rodeghier and Allan Hendry (August 1982 Journal) are representative of what passes for UFOlogical thinking in 1982, then maybe UFOlogy is a pseudoscience after all. In criticizing Project Identification, Rodeghier (in IDF) and Hendry (in FATE) raised very serious and specific questions about Harley Rutledge's methodology and conclusions. William Leet and Lucius Parish to the contrary, neither critic mounted anything remotely like a personal attack on Rutledge, recognizing that it is his approach, not his personaltiy, that is at issue. If we can judge from the MUFON writer's responses, the criticisms must have been right on target, since neither Leet nor Parish bothers to address a single major issue raised in the reviews to which they object so vehemently. Instead they content themselves, in the manner of men unable to articulate a serious refutation, with sarcastic remarks and irrelevant speculations about the critic's motives. (Parish's suggestion that Hendry, author of a book universally recognized as a classic in the literature, has \"contributed little of value to the subject\" is especially outrageous.)

We stoutly refuse use of the photos â€” it is a matter of principle. Now, when I go to the market, I glance through each issue of the tabloid, hoping against hope that Bailey's story will not be peeking out. If it is, I hope my name will be removed and also the name of a certain UFO research organization with which I am associated. I have requested this by letter, and Rev. Bailey has requested 16 that the whole article be scrapped if it cannot be accurate. This is only one of the recent incidents of media-mishmash which have resulted from the \"release\" of the Bailey photo experience. As more develops, this may turn out to be more than a one-part column. It is necessary to explain fully what happened in case an article on the Bailey photos appears, unwanted, in the National Enquirer. Our colleagues should know that we had nothing to do with its inception and tried desperately afterward to patch up the situation so that the least harm was done to the UFO field and to the credibility of those caught up in the entrapment. Perhaps this experience will help to warn other researchers who might inadvertently find themselves trapped in similar situations. NOTES 1. I have tried repeatedly, from all major UFO research organizations in the U.S., to have these photos enhanced, but have been informed that they are not UFO material, but rather belong in the field of psychic research. 2. The pictures would not benefit from normal computer enchancement techniques, but would require reduction and \"deblurring\" techniques to bring out the information we seek. 3. Being a writer, researcher, and script-writer myself, any U.S. markets for the Bailey story would be in the realm of my own interest, if and when opportunity for more scientific study on the photos presents itself. 4.

Particularly during the last 50 years, there have been extensive attempts to definitively photograph the Loch Ness Monster, which has come to be known affectionately as Nessie. Many electronic devices have been employed in and above the water, to no avail. Now a retired Scottish electronics engineer named Robert P. Craig 1 has developed an excellent explanation for this long-mystifying phenomenon. He approached the problem from two diverse directions. First, he questioned the assumption that this involved an animal. A few observers had said that Nessie \"looks like a telephone pole.\" A log looks like a telephone pole; could Nessie be a log that somehow comes up from the bottom of the lake? A good candidate, he thought, might be the majestic Scots pine, Pinus syluestris, which once covered the whole Central Highlands of Scotland. The tree is loaded with its own chemicals â€” resins,' turpentine, tar oils, phenols, sugars, and many types of gases. And these chemicals are affected by pressure â€” such as you find at the bottom of an extremely deep lake. Second, he wondered: There are more than 500 fresh water lakes in Scotland; why are Monsters found in only three of them? Nessie is sighted about 100 times a year in Loch Ness, about 30 in Loch Morar, and 3 in Loch Tay. Aha, he found: These are all unusually deep lakes. But Loch Lomond is also very deep, and no Monsters are sighted there. So Craig checked the population of pine trees nearby. Thick stands of pine surround Loch Ness. Substantial but lesser numbers of pine trees grow near Loch Morar and Loch Tay. But there are no pine trees on the bonny bonny banks of Loch Lomond. Craig explains that when a pine log falls into the lake and gradually sinks to the bottom, it does not succumb to the \"enormous pressure\" down there as beech or birch would. Instead, the pressure squeezes the trunk layers of bark, cork, and cambium, and the tree's resin forms a \"strong waterproof outer skin not unlike marine plywood.\" As the long-submerged encapsulated tree trunk decays, gases form inside. The pressure of the gases, he points out, \"can reach quite high proportions because of the back pressure of/the water outside.\"  i Futher expansion of the gases then \"drives resin and tar oils out toward the only possible exits\" at the stumps of the branches and ends of the trunk. They form extrusions or blisters filled with minute gas bubbles. Eventually these blisters in effect become buoyancy tanks, and finally.the log begins to rise. As it nears the surface, its internal pressure is far above that around it and it \"is almost bursting at the seams.\" It pokes its snout above the surface, foams and thrashes about as the gas escapes, and then sinks quietly below the surface. The starting point of Craig's scenario is to question the assumption made for lo these many years that the phenomenon was caused by an animal. Or, to put it another way, that there were only two choices: either it was a mysterious animal, or those people who \"saw\" it were mistaken. Neither of these theories is very good. How could an animal be \"seen\" so often for so many years, and still not be found when tracking equipment is used in the loch, and when no body of an expired or injured animal is ever found? And how could an animal produce so much froth or foam in such fresh water? On the alternative, there are always a few strange people who \"see\" strange things, but surely hundreds of people can't be making up stories. In the UFO field, there's the continuing strong assumption that anything that can't be easily explained must be an extraterrestrial spacecraft. As with Nessie, there are usually only two choices: a UFO is from outer space, or the people who \"see\" it-are staging a hoax or making a gross error in perception. In the Travis Walton case, people see only two\" alternatives: Walton was \"abducted\" onto a flying saucer, or Walton and his six cohorts got together and made up the whole wild story, and have continued to maintain it in all the years since. I find both those theories quite unlikely. In \"abduction\" stories developed during hypnosis, people see only two alternatives: the hypnotized person is describing the actual \"objective\" truth, or they're making up a story as a hoax. Let's permit at least one other alternative: they are developing a story in their subconscious mind, similar to the way we dream every night, a story that didn't \"really\" happen but which is of such strong symbolic meaning to the creator that the hypnotized person reacts as if it were true. Nessie,. of course, is a single phenomenon, whereas UFOs come in many sizes and shapes and speeds and luminosities and colors and electromagnetic properties, so the blanket term \"UFO\" lumps together a dozen, or perhaps many more, separate phenomena. We're not going to find a single explanation that \"solves\" the \"UFO problem.\" The first step is to become aware of our assumption, and to expand our options and possible explanations. Hang loose, ladies and gentlemen. The UFO solutions may turn out to be as unexpected as a pine log for Nessie. Robert P.

(Ret.) over the past few years, George had finally consented to grant your Director permission to publish a human interest update on his famous UFO \"dogfight\" on October 1, 1948 over the Fargo, North Dakota airport, witnessed by L. D. Jensen, air traffic controller. After 27 minutes of futile attempts to get close to identify the round white light, he landed his North Dakota Air National Guard P- 51 Mustang fighter. Even though this classic UFO case from 1948 has appeared in publications all over the world, George, when first contacted, stated that he would have to obtain permission from the U.S. Air Force before agreeing to publish the story in the Journal. His reluctance was based upon several factors. In addition to the national publicity that he received, such as a Saturday Evening Post article in which the author ridiculed his experience, an appearance on the program \"We The People,\" an interview by Major Donald E. Keyhoe; he was asked to transfer to Wright AFB to receive training as a UFO investigator and promptly assigned to West Germany. As a career officer, he felt that he had the confidence of Project Blue Book personnel to consider, but at the same time the apparent public ridicule hurt him personally. George and his family lived in New Braunfels, Texas, only 14 miles from Seguin. They spent their summers at their cabin in Canada and their winters at home in south Texas.
