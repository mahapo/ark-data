FROM THE EDITOR Following feedback from our readers, we've tried distancing ourselves from some of the current controversies roiling ufology, but it seems the subject will not go away. Rather than sticking our heads in the sand while waiting for it to disappear or evaporate, we've decided that you — the concerned reader and subscriber — should be informed of some of the ongoing developments likely to affect the future of the field. We feel, on one hand, that honesty and open publication will best enable you to make up your own minds about such matters, and, secondly, that those who may feel unduly criticized are quite capable of mounting their own defense, which we welcome. We also apologize for the lateness of the January issue, but have added four additional pages in an effort to compensate and keep current. We have much more material on hand, and hope to be back to our regular schedule next issue. We appreciate your patience.

This article, along with contributions by Hilary Evans, Michael Persinger, Alvin Lawson, Peter Rojcewicz and others, ap- pears in the current issue of Ar- chaeus 5, available for $8, postage paid, from the above address. In 1958, C. G. Jung published his classical ufological work, Ein moderner Mythus von Dingen, die am Himmel gesehen werden. 1 Jung MUFON UFO JOURNAL felt very strongly that the reports of unidentified flying objects (UFOs) that began in the years 1946-47 por- tended great social, political, and perhaps even environmental changes. He even tied the UFO phenomenon into the transition from the Age of Pisces to the Age of Aquarius. 2 The points made by Ein moderner My thus with regard to UFOs are: 1) \"Something is seen, but one doesn't know what.\" 3 The word \"seen\" is qualified here. According to Jung: \"The formulation ['Something is seen, but it isn't known what'] leaves NO. 261 JANUARY 1990 the question of 'seeing' open. Something material could be seen, or something psychic could be seen. Both are realities, but of different kinds.\" 4 2) The UFO Phenomenon, whatever its ultimate nature might be, is the focus of projections 5 involving archetypal images arising from the collective unconscious. These projec- tions give rise to statements about UFOs and their behavior that can be readily and successfully compared to images and structures found in mythology and folklore. The fact that PAGES"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"this can be done does not say anything about the ultimate origin or nature of the UFO phenomenon. \"The apparent physical nature of the UFOs creates such insoluble puzzles for even the best brains, and on the other hand has built up such an impressive legend, that one feels tempted to take them as a ninety-nine per cent psychic product and subject them accordingly to the usual psychological interpretation. Should it be that an unknown physical phenomenon is the outward cause of the myth, this could detract nothing from the myth, for many myths have meteorological and other natural phenomena as accompanying causes which by no means explain them ... For primitive man any object, for in- stance an old tin that has been thrown away, can suddenly assume the im- portance of a fetish. This effect is ob- viously not inherent in the tin, but is a psychic product.\" 6 3) The UFO phenomenon is \"real.\" This aspect of Jung's argument generates a great deal of confusion. Jung often used \"real\" to refer not on- ly to external physical reality, but to the reality of the psyche. He was far more interested in what he termed \"psychic fact.\" A psychic fact can be any statement, image or belief that someone expresses. Unicorns are a psychic fact and, as such, have a cer- tain psychic reality, part of which still exerts its influence by way of our fascination with stories of such creatures. Therefore one must be very cautious about Jung's use of \"real.\" Jung's positions are fairly conser- vative ones, to which he attempted to adhere in as rigorous a manner as he could; nevertheless, he took note of the reports available at the time and considered — more or less as a sideline — the evidence for other in- terpretations of the phenomena. Unfortunately, Jung's purely speculative sallies into alternative in- terpretations have led to considerable misunderstanding — a very active misunderstanding that was prepared to latch onto anything to feed itself. This misconception has resulted in some ufologists claiming that Jung supported this, that, or^ the other theory, simply because he mentioned it and made a few cogent comments. PAGE 4 C. J. JUNG Jung paid about equal time and at- tention to speculations that UFOs were insects, 7 that they were generated by parapsychological ef- fects, 8 and that they could even be related to ball lightning (giving a pres- cient nod to Phil Klass) or as-yet- unknown manifestations of elec- tromagnetism (anticipating Michael Persinger?) 9 as he did to the extrater- restrial hypothesis (ETH). This is especially so if one subtracts the many comments by Jung — comments he would probably not have bothered to make in the normal course of things -- on the physical reality of extrater- restrial flying saucers that were ag- gressively elicited from him over the years by numbers of eager UFO buffs. Manned by Extraterrestrials? This is the single issue that I wish to address here. My conversations and correspondence with several ufologists has made it abundantly clear to me that evidence of even the weakest of Jung's endorsements of the extraterrestrial hypothesis (ETH) is of the utmost importance to them. MUFON UFO JOURNAL This in spite of the fact that Jung was that most contemptible of things — an armchair ufologist. He did no fieldwork, he had available only a fraction of the vast ufological literature now available, and he indulged in psychological interpretations of UFO reports — a methodology now entire- ly out of fashion. Jung's comments on matters ufological, other than the psychological ones, were retailed from the opinions of active ufologists, such as Ruppelt and Keyhoe — reason enough not to become too attached to his pronouncements on issues of the physical reality of UFOs. Be that as it may, the fact that several modern ufologists — and not only ufologists — cite Jung in support of the silliest and most unscientific of ideas has moved me to attempt to clarify as much as possible (and I believe it can be made quite clear) what Jung's position was in regard to extraterres- trial invasion of our airspace. The source for much confusion on Jung's beliefs derives from the letter from Jung to the weekly magazine Weltwoche (Zurich) 10 in response to a request for an interview. Several questions and answers followed, and all were printed in the same issue. Translated extracts from his interview were published in Flying Saucer Review (London), in Courier Interplanetaire (Switzerland), and in the APRO Bulletin (U.S.). The ex- tracts were translated in such a way as to give the most favorable impres- sion to the notion that Jung sup- ported a spacecraft theory. None of these tendentious translations were submitted to Jung prior to publication. These extracts received a great deal of publicity and were picked up by the international wire services. Jung's response to those unauthorized ar- ticles was unequivocal. \"As a result of an article published in the APRO Bulletin\" he noted, \"the report has been spread by the press that in my opinion the UFOs are physically real. This report is altogether false ... I ex- pressly state that I cannot commit myself on the question to the physical reality or unreality of the UFOs since I do not possess sufficient evidence either for or against.\" 11 And, in a letter to Major Donald E. Keyhoe, Jung wrote: \"The article in NO. 261 JANUARY 1990"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"APRO Bulletin July 1958, which caused all that stir in the press, is un- fortunately inaccurate.\" 12 In spite of these clear disavowals, certain ufologists continue, irrespon- sibly, to cite the spurious extracts in support of their contention that Jung believed in the reality of invading ETs. Timothy Good does just this in Above Top Secret: The Worldwide UFO Coverup. 13 In examining Good's claims and the way he presents them, I am not concerned with demon- strating Jung's actual position on UFOs, but merely with showing that Good's account of Jung's position is inaccurate, misleading, and motivated by his own commitment to the ETH. According to Good: \"... Jung made a thorough study of UFOs since first becoming interested in 1946, and in addition to being a consultant to the Aerial Phenomena Research Organization (APRO) wrote a book entitled Flying Saucers: A Modern Myth of Things Seen in the Skies, which has led sceptics to jump to the conclusion that he regarded the phenomenon as entirely psycholog- ical in origin. Nothing could be fur- ther from the truth.\" (p. 435) Good is quite right here. Jung cer- tainly stated that he did not think that — if the reports of sightings were to be regarded as accurate — the UFO phenomenon was purely psycholog- ical. Good cites the following passage, which purports to be quoted from Jung: \"A purely psychological explanation is ruled out by the fact that a large number of observations indicate a natural one, even a physical one. ... The American Air Force (despite its contradictory statements), as well as the Canadian, consider the observa- tions to be real. ... However, the 'discs' ... do not behave in accordance with physical laws but as though without weight, and they show signs of in- telligent guidance, by quasi-human pilots\" [Original emphasis], (p. 435) I assume that the passage above is an edited version of: \"The possibility of a purely psychological explanation is illusory, for a large number of ob- servations point to a natural phenom- enon, or even a physical one ... . Despite its contradictory statements, the American Air Force, as well as the MUFON UFO JOURNAL Canadian, consider the sightings to be 'real,' and have set up special bureaux to collect the reports. The 'disks,' however, that is, the objects themselves, do not behave in accor- dance with physical laws but as though they were weightless, and they show signs of intelligent guidance such as would suggest quasi-human pilots. Yet the accelerations are so tremendous that no human being could survive them.\" 14 It should be noted that the transla- tion quoted by Good has certain features that are more supportive of the extraterrestrial hypothesis: there are no quotation marks around \"real\"; the subjunctive phrase \"such as would suggest\" is replaced by \"by,\" with no qualification; the words set in italics and denoted by Good as \"original emphasis\" are not the same; and the sentence \"Yet the accelerations are so tremendous that no human being could survive them\" is left out of the quotation altogether. This last sentence indicates that Jung's asser- tion of \"quasi-human\" pilots is based on the inference that human pilots would be killed by the acceleration — not that he had any other special knowledge or information about such hypothesized pilots. Good's quotation is at substantial variance from the ver- sion published in the superbly edited Collected Works. It seems apparent that Good is uncritically citing the unauthorized versions of Jung's 1954 statements — versions that even UFO buffs recognize as spurious. 15 \"Unequivocal\" Good also quotes the letter from Jung to Major Donald Keyhoe to support his contention that Jung's position on the government cover-up of UFO information was \"unequiv- ocal\" : 16 \"If it is true that the AAF or the government withholds tale-telling facts, then one can only say that this is the most unpsychological and stupid policy one could invent. It is self-evident that the public ought to be told the truth, because ultimately it will nevertheless come to daylight. There can hardly be any greater shock than the H-bomb and yet everybody knows of it without fainting.\" \"If it is true\" is not an unequivocal NO. 261 JANUARY 1990 way of putting things. Jung is un- equivocal about his opinion of the military //it is concealing information. He is not unequivocal about whether they are in fact doing so. He is mere- ly speculating. The following quote 17 also originates from the unauthorized extracts: \"If ... the extra-terrestrial origin of the phenomena should be confirmed ... it would put us, without doubt, in the extremely precarious position of primitive communities today in con- flict with the superior culture of the whites: the rudder would be removed from our grasp, and we should lose our pleasant dreams. \"Naturally, it would be chiefly our science and our technology which would have to be consigned to the scrap-heap. What such a catastrophe would mean on the moral plane we can in some sort judge by the ruin of primitive cultures of which we are the witnesses. That the construction of these machines proves a scientific technology, and one immensely superior to ours, admits of no two opinions. 18 Just as the Pax Britannica put an end to the disputes between the tribes of Africa, so our world could unroll its Iron Curtain and use it as scrap iron, with all the millions of tons of guns, warships and munitions. But we would have been 'discovered' and colonized — sufficient reason for universal panic! \"If we wish to avoid such a catastrophe, the authorities in posses- sion of important information should not hesitate to enlighten the public as soon and as completely as possible and should, above all, stop these ridiculous antics of mysteries and vague allusions\" [Original emphasis]. The \"original emphasis\" asserted by Good does not appear in the version to be found in the Collected Works. Apparently, someone also substituted the more definite word \"these\" for the more hypothetical \"such\" in the \"em- phasized\" sentence. Good also claims that Jung was a consultant to the Aerial Phenomena Research Organization (APRO). 19 It is worthwhile to see how Jung regard- ed this relationship: \"My relations with APRO are confined to the following: while I was collecting material for the PAGES"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"above-mentioned book [Flying Saucers], the APRO Bulletin ap- proached me in a friendly manner. When this organization recently asked me if they might consider me to be an honorary member, I consented. I have sent my book to APRO to in- form them of my position in regard to the Ufo question. APRO advocates the physical reality of the Ufo with much zeal and idealism. I therefore regard its misleading article as a regrettable accident.\" 20 Scarcely the sort of endorsement one would expect from a committed consultant! It may be that Jung casually agreed to be a consultant, even though he apparently did not remember doing so; 21 on the other hand, it is well known how eagerly fledgling organizations with little recognition will leap for the oppor- tunity to include a famous name on the letterhead. This issue is open to speculation. Timothy Good was also the coauthor, along with Lou Zinsstag, of the very silly book, George Adamski: The Untold Story, 22 which, among other bizarre arguments designed to rehabilitate Adamski — one of the most thoroughly debunked of UFO- hoaxsters — attempts to defend his claim that the other side of the moon has lakes, mountains and vegetation. Lou Zinsstag laments the malicious- ness of the Swiss weekly, Weltwoche, for subsequently publishing a note clarifying the misunderstanding pro- voked by the unauthorized extracts taken from that publication. That note concluded that \"... via this intricate path [by way of the unauthorized mistranslations], C. G. Jung was made to look like a gullible believer in flying saucers\" (p. 46). CSI #27 UFO scholars will recognize CSI Publication #27 as, perhaps, the strongest of all attacks on Jung with regard to his position on UFOs. It is anonymous and is very polemical in tone. The sour grapes attitude of the writer leads to some\" exceedingly strange arguments, including direct at- tacks on Jung's ability and knowledge as a psychologist. 23 The author of CSI Publication #27 PAGE 6 — at least in the early pages of the document — gives the impression of being an intelligent, thorough in- dividual. His reason, however, is soon devoured by a gobbling, abject belief in the ETH. Since many of the points he made in this paper have formed the substance of subsequent publica- tions regarding Jung and UFOs it is worthwhile examining them in some detail. In general, the feeling one gets from the author of the CSI publica- tion is that Jung was, in some sense, supposed to have written a treatise on the reality of extraterrestrials, and that by not doing what he never intended to do, he had somehow betrayed ufologists and had not told the truth. The author is perplexed and angered by the ambiguities and contradictions of Jung's statements. The psycholog- ical commentaries are, for him, unintelligible and represent an in- explicable detour from the really im- portant ideas — those concerning the possible reality of the ETH. He tries with considerable energy to throw the psychological ideas out of considera- tion, even suggesting an alternate way of reading the text of Flying Saucers ... so that one may avoid reading the psychological commentaries altogether. 24 The CSI author notwithstanding, we may comfortably assume that Jung, a pioneer psychologist of inter- national standing, really did wish his work to be considered a psychological study. In relation to that, he con- sidered himself to be on an empirical project devoted to elucidating the psychic aspects of the phenomenon. Jung states quite clearly that his ex- pertise and authority do not extend beyond that range. Expecting this to be understood, he ventured what must be regarded as opinions and speculations. For Jung, even those speculations that went beyond the limits of the psychological never- theless evoked in him new ideas of psychological interest. This fact, com- bined with his years of psychological investigation, with its inherent am- biguities and paradoxes, produced statements in his writings that, when taken at absolute face value, are in- deed contradictory. This, by the way, is not a problem that Jung vengeful- MUFON UFO JOURNAL ly visited upon ufologists. Psychol- ogists — even Jungian psychologists — often have the utmost difficulty in sifting out Jung's exact position on any number of psychological con- cepts. This is an important point. Jung did not single out his work Flying Saucers as a special opportunity to exercise a newly discovered personal desire to be ambiguous. A little of this ambiguity is relieved, however, by Jung's statement, in 1957, to Lou Zinsstag, a complete saucer believer, that his book on flying saucers would be coming out soon, and that she \"would probably not like it much.\" 25 Thus Jung indicated, in advance of publication, that he regarded his book as skeptical with regard to the expec- tations of the saucer-believer. Let us look at some actual am- biguities and contradictions (other than Jung's ideas of \"seeing\" and of what is \"real\") in his UFO book — one example from the \"real\" and one from the psychological. One of the most definite statements Jung makes is in regard to the detect- ability of UFOs by radar. I strongly feel that Jung's serious consideration of this and the idea of a government coverup was determined to a large ex- tent by his favorable opinion on Keyhoe's writings and the friendly cor- respondence he and Keyhoe carried out. Jung's strongest statement with regard to radar occurs in Flying Saucers, p. 413: \"So far as I know it remains an established fact, supported by numerous observations, that Ufos have not only been seen visually but also have been picked up on the radar screen and have left traces on the photographic plate. I base myself here not only on the comprehensive reports by Ruppelt and Keyhoe, which leave no room for doubt in this regard, but also on the fact that the astrophysicist, Professor Menzel, has not succeeded, despite all his efforts, in offering a satisfying scientific ex- planation of even one authentic Ufo report. It boils down to nothing less than this: that either psychic projec- tions throw back a radar echo, or else the appearance of real objects affords an opportunity for mythological pro- jections.\" Putting aside the fact that the very NO. 261 JANUARY 1990"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"next sentence after this starts with \"Here I must remark that even if the Ufos are physically real ... ,\" we seem to have pretty positive endorsement of the radar effect. At this point, I must also put aside questions of the state-of-the-art in the 1950s with regard to radar and the glitches, both known and unknown, that might have occurred with greater or lesser frequency. Jung, however, in his irritatingly contradictory style, still expressed skepticism about radar. Early in Fly- ing Saucers, he states that he has con- sulted with Max Knoll, a radar specialist, and that what he had to say with regard to the reliability of the radar sightings was \"not encouraging.\" In a letter to Charles B. Harnett (Dec. 12, 1957) Jung remarks that \"The only tangible fact seems to be the radar echo, but I am informed by experts on radar that such observa- tions are not beyond reasonable doubt.\" 26 But perhaps the most revealing statement by Jung about radar and his real overall opinion occurs in his Flying Saucers: \"From many of the reports, particularly the early ones, it is evident that the Ufos can appear suddenly and vanish equally sudden- ly. They can be tracked by radar but remain invisible to the eye, and con- versely, can be seen by the eye but not detected by radar. Ufos can make themselves invisible at will, it is said, and must obviously consist of a substance that is visible at one mo- ment and invisible at the next. The nearest analogy to this is a volatile liq- uid which condenses out of an invisi- ble state into the form of drops. In reading the old texts one can still feel the miracle of disappearance and reappearance which the alchemists beheld in the vaporization of water or quicksilver ... The fantasies born of musing over the steaming cooking- pot — one of the most ancient ex- periences of mankind — may also be responsible for the sudden disap- pearance and reappearance of the Ufo.\" (p. 332f.) Here Jung is quite ready to throw radar in with visual sightings and in- terpret them together in alchemical terms, as he did with many patients' fantasies and dream images. This in- MUFON UFO JOURNAL dicates very strongly Jung's bias in favor of a psychic/psychological in- terpretation — even with regard to the physical evidence produced by radar. At the very least,- this passage in- dicates that Jung was not thinking of the radar evidence in exactly the same way a hard scientist would. This again supports my assertion that, for Jung, the whole manner of discussing reality was quite different from that understood by most people, and by ufologists in particular. This discussion of radar has led to the point where we must consider Jung's ideas of the relationship of psychic phenomena, particularly parapsychological phenomena, to the question of the reality of UFOs. This idea is, again, one of considerable controversy among ufologists and, again, Jung's expression of his ideas on this score seem ambiguous and contradictory. Those quotations that are cited against Jung believing in UFOs as a parapsychological phenomenon are the following: \"The ... hypothesis that Ufos are something psychic that is endowed with certain physical properties seems even less probable, for where should such a thing come from? If weight- lessness is a hard proposition to swallow, then the notion of a materialized psychism opens a bot- tomless void under our feet. Para- psychology is, of course, acquainted with the fact of materialization. But this phenomenon depends on the presence of one or more mediums who exude a weighable substance, and it occurs only in their immediate vicinity. The psyche can move the body, but only inside the living organism. That something psychic, possessing material qualities and with a high charge of energy, could appear by itself high in the air at a great distance from any human mediums — this surpasses our comprehension. Here our knowledge leaves us com- pletely in the lurch, and it is therefore pointless to speculate any further in this direction.\" 27 And: \"It is hardly possible to [discuss] the analogy of the Saucers with parapsychological phenomena, since a basis for comparison is totally lacking. If we wished to take such a NO. 261 JANUARY 1990 possibility seriously, it would first have to be shown that the \"apparitions\" are casually connected with psychic states; in other words, that under the influence of certain emotional condi- tions a major population group ex- periences the same psychic dissocia- tion and the same exteriorization of psychic energy as does a single medium. All we know at present is that collective visions do exist. But whether collective physical phe- nomena, such as levitations, appari- tions of light, materializations, etc., can also be produced is a moot ques- tion. At present any reference to the parapsychological aspect only demonstrates the boundless perplex- ity in which we find ourselves to- day.\" 28 I especially want to draw the reader's attention to the context of the emphasized word \"physical\" in this paragraph. Clearly, Jung also uses the word to cover a range of pos- sibilities. So when Jung says that a merely psychological explanation won't do, he may well be considering sources of physical manifestation ex- clusive of those familiar to mainstream science. In fact, Jung does consider that parapsychological factors might be in- volved. 29 Early in the text of Flying Saucers, 30 he brings up his theory of synchronicity in connection with UFOs, and on p. 411f. he goes into a considerable discussion of para- psychology and psychokinesis in con- nection with the subject. His state- ment that \"the notion of a material- ized psychism opens a bottomless void under our feet\" may, without dif- ficulty, be regarded as ironic in tone. Much more explicitly, in a letter to Fowler McCormick (March 20, 1956), Jung writes \"One does not even know for certain whether [the Ufo] is a natural phenomenon, or a con- trivance invented by beings com- parable to men, or rather a beast like animal travelling in space, a sort of huge space-bug, or — last but not least — a parapsychological phe- nomenon ... .\" 31 Space Insects & Ambiguity In order to read Jung properly, a definite prerequisite is a high tolerance PAGE 7"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"for ambiguity. Such tolerance is not a major trait of the average ufologist. But let us leave this topic of Jung's contradictions and ambiguities and go on to some specific criticisms, made by the author of CSI Publication #27, of other aspects of Flying Saucers. One point, which might seem minor to anyone but the author of the CSI document, involves the meaning of the German word Wesenheiten. The author begins by complimenting the translator of Ein moderner Mythus into English, R. F. C. Hull. ... \"Hull's translation reads well and is reasonably accurate. However, an im- portant exception should be men- tioned: in both Chapter IV and VI Jung refers to the UFOs as Wesenheiten (beings, entities). And in both places we find that the translator has suppressed this idea, substituting \"objects\" or \"pheonomena\" for the correct rendering \"entities.\" The effect is to obscure from the English reader what is perhaps the most interesting point in whole book: Jung's indepen- dent rediscovery of the space animal theory.\" 32 After reading the CSI document, one is impressed by how much time and effort the author spent on things less interesting than the space-animal theory. This translation issue was picked up by Richard Toronto in his paper \"Did Carl Jung Believe in Fly- ing Saucers?\" 33 and used (as far as I can tell) to bolster the idea that Jung believed the UFOs to be real — and maybe space insects as well. Having been a graduate student in German literature and a translator for a major biomedical company for a few years, I was suspicious of this translation of Wesenheit, a term that is very difficult to translate. The dic- tionaries give a variety of possible translations, some of which support the interpretation by the CSI author, and some that do not. Both sorts of interpretation are usable in the con- text of what Jung was saying. Rely- ing not on dictionaries, then, but rather on common usage, I consulted a prominent German professor at the University of Minnesota by phone. Without giving him any indication of what I was working on, I asked him, first: what the root noun of die Wesenheit — das Wesen — meant. PAGE 8 He laughed, then replied: \"There are some words that are impossible to translate. [Das Wesen] means \"numinal,\" \"nature,\" the character of a person, the essence of something. [It is] one of the words Germans love to use because it is so nebulous.\" I next asked him what die Wesenheit meant. \"Ah, that is the abstract 34 of das Wesen\" He laughed again. \"It can even be a term for God. It is the catchall term for anything with a great many aspects. It is an abstraction of an abstraction.\" It is clear that Jung's choice of the word Wesenheiten was an excellent one. The term could be considered to convey no position at all with regard to the phenomenon; or, if anything, the ideas imbedded in it of the \"numinous\" and of \"God\" and \"nature\" would fit in very well with Jung's general approach. Another error in the CSI publica- tion, which I have difficulty under- standing, involves the accusation that Jung \"applies 'his' space-animal hypothesis (of whose prior existence he is evidently entirely ignorant) to the interpretation of two UFO cases reported nearly four centuries ago\" (p. 7). The problem here is that it seems unlikely that Jung took any special credit for his \"discovery,\" since Jung cites Gerald Heard's hypothesis that flying saucers are a species of bees from Mars. In any case, I know of other nonufological people who have come up with the space- insect/space-animal idea indepen- dently. Furthermore, Michel Meurger, in his ground breaking study, Lake Monster Traditions: A Cross-Cultural Analysis, has demonstrated, by way of actual field studies, that stories about anomalous animals, such as lake monsters, become transformed — according to the events and spirit of the times — first, into technological contrivances of some familiarity and mystery, such as secret Nazi sub- marines, and then into much more mysterious UFO-like vehicles with ex- traordinary performance character- istics. 35 This deep folklore connection between anomalous animals and UFOs was unknown to Jung, but he would certainly have found this infor- mation useful. Along similar lines, MUFON UFO JOURNAL there is evidence that the legends of the American Indian Trickster figure have been incorporated into reports about \"phantom helicopters\" and anomalous cattle mutilations. 36 One of the very bizarre ideas that the CSI author puts forward is that Jung's book, Ein moderner Mythus, was intended to be read only by \"his coterie of students and admirers, but that when he found his views sudden- ly thrust into an embarrassing notorie- ty among the hoi polhi, he yielded to the temptation to beat a strategic retreat\"; and \"For the press and public, 'scientific' skepticism; for friends and initiates, space insects!\" (p. 7) This is, of course, nonsensical. Aside from the fact that Ein moderner Mythus was published by the well- known Rascher Verlag of Stuttgart, Jung's status, especially in Europe, was such that it was scarcely possible that widespread discussion of the book would not occur. The fact that it didn't cause a Jung-believes-in ETs- and-their-spaceships uproar is that most readers of the book were not caught up in the concerns of the ufologist of the time. Since Jung was a famous psychologist, the book was taken for what is was — a psycho- logical monograph. In short, neither the intelligentsia, nor the hoi polloi, read the book from the UFO buff's perspective — a perspective that tends to disregard the straightforward and commonsensical view of Jung's work. It may also be assumed that Europeans, reading Ein moderner Mythus in the original — and therefore without benefit of the \"magic\" of a ufologist's translation — did not find the work to be indicative of a serious commitment to the \"reali- ty\" of UFOs. This assertion — that Jung's book was conceived as a quasi-private document on his belief in the reality of UFOs — is further refuted by the fact that Jung expressed himself quite skeptically about UFOs in private cor- respondence to friends and acquain- tances, as can be verified easily by reading his published letters. Much is also made of Jung's concern over notoriety and fear for his scientific reputation. This is the reason, ufologists claim, that he backed down from his pro-ETH position. NO. 261 JANUARY 1990"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"Again the extreme insularity of ufologists is clearly demonstrated. As has been said, \"When your only tool is a hammer, everything looks like a nail.\" The fact is that Jung's theories and hypotheses regarding archetypes, the collective unconscious, and syn- chronicity (to mention but three) were met with tremendous hostility from the scientific community — as his defense of Freud and psychoanalysis had been years before. Later, in spite of the potential consequences to his career, he challenged Freud's con- siderable authority. The publication of Answer to Job caused an enormous furor that went all the way to the Vatican and engendered attacks from such notables as Martin Buber and Victor White, causing Jung ultimate- ly to lose the close friendship of the latter. In the context of these issues and conflicts having real, immediate, and serious consequences for Jung, ufological squabblings are very small potatoes. There are numerous additional criticisms to be found in CSI Publica- tion #27, but they are simply not wor- thy of consideration, and reflect a bit- terness and disappointment that one usually finds only in cases of extreme religious disillusionment. Jung continued to express skep- ticism about the reality of UFOs right up until his death. Perhaps Jung's last words on the subject were said to Eugene Rolfe during an intimate in- terview just six months before Jung's death. A young man, knowing of Rolfe's impending visit to Jung, asked him to ask Jung if he had changed his opinion about flying saucers. Jung responded: \"I had no opinion about them! 1 am just in- terested in them from the psychological side.\" 37 Afterword Some months ago, I felt that one of the simplest ways to find out what Jung believed about flying saucers would be to write to someone who had known him personally and in- timately. The most obvious choice for me was Dr. Marie-Louise von Franz. Von Franz had been Jung's student, research assistant, and colleague almost continuously over a period of MUFON UFO JOURNAL some 27 years. She collaborated with Jung on his studies in alchemy, writing a companion volume, Aurora Consurgens, to Jung's difficult late work, Mysterium Coniunctionis, and contributed substantially to the writing of Aion. She also collaborated with Emma Jung (C. G. Jung's wife) on The Grail Legend, and brought this work to completion after Mrs. Jung's death. I wrote to Dr. von Franz re- garding Jung's beliefs about flying saucers and received the following reply: Dear Mr. Stillings, Neither the early Jung nor the late Jung believed in the reality of extrater- restrial ufos. He thought there was \"outside in matter\" something unknown behind it. But he was in- terested in. that there were such powerful fantasies around them. They are psychically real. In his paper he analyzed the meaning of these fan- tasies. That's all. All my best wishes Marie-Louise v Franz Notes 1. Zurich / Stuttgart: Rascher Verlag.

Flying Saucers, p. 329. It is common for UFO buffs to reject Jung's assertions about the mythological and psychological aspects of the UFO phenomenon. This completely untenable position reveals a deep-seated fear that any such critique might be fatal to their beliefs. One finds similar fears among second-rate artists and writers. Jung, however — in contrast to Freud — rejected the idea that art could be entirely reduced to matters of per- sonal complexes. 7. Ibid., pp. 316, 352. 8.

Laibow, M.D. Laibow is a clinical psycho- therapist specializing in the treat- ment of both child and adult pa- tients. She is the coordinator for TREAT - Treatment and Research on Experienced Anomalous Trauma. Laibow lives in New York. Stories of abduction by sentient non-human creatures are changing residence. Where once they were the sole province of religion, folklore and other systems based in belief, today we are confronted with the fascinating prospect of seeing such purported en- counters moving into the domain of science and being subjected to the strictures of research, compilation, data-accumulation and analysis. We look at the encounters described with non-human beings and ask, \"Are alien abductors REAL?\" using REAL to signify physically based exper- iences, not experiential ones. I propose that alien abductions are real whether they are physical manifestation of anything that has \"happened\" or not. 1 propose that alien abductions are an appropriate subject of serious scientific concern. This is true whatever our personal belief structure regarding alien abduc- tions demands that we believe about their possible origin. I further propose that alien abductions are of great im- portance in understanding ourselves, whatever their origin may be. Since examination of the population report- ing these experiences reveals a highly symptomatic post traumatic state in many individuals, I further propose that those experiencing the abusive and harmful aspects of alien abduc- tions should be treated with the same respect; concern and therapeutic modalities as victims of rape, ter- rorism, civil disasters and other life- changing traumatic events. Alien abductions are popularly thought to have burst upon the scene with Betty and Barney Hill in their celebrated story of an encounter in 1961. In fact, more (and less) well PAGE 10 documented and investigated cases exist earlier (1957), according to Thomas E. Bullard in his exhaustive study (UFO Abductions: The Measure of a Mystery, Fund for UFO Research, 1987). Stories and artifacts suggestive of this sort of episode predate modern society but their interpretation must remain speculative. When the un- folding of the Hill's strange case took place, it was first perceived by Betty and Barney as an anomalous event, then investigated by Walter Webb and others who were active UFO in- vestigators, then taken up by other, non-therapist investigators. Finally, in order to provide the highest quality assistance possible, the help of a qualified professional was sought. Benjamin Simon, M.D. was perceived to have outstanding credentials as a military and civilian psychiatrist. His experience in battle fatigue and hyp- nosis was thought to give him a rather special and highly applicable exper- tise in cases which might be roughly similar to the Hill's. In addition, he was seen as having an appropriately disinterested stance: it was assumed that, as a medical practitioner and a trained therapist he would, of course, have no stake whatsoever in what the eventual outcome of the case, (i.e., the \"reality\" of the trauma) \"should\" be. In other words, as the significance of the Hill case increased (in terms of their own discomfort and in the estimation of others) the more specialized and expert assistance of a psychotherapist was sought. Ill Prepared In fact, Dr. Simon was ill prepared to pursue the case. His world view, his personal prejudices and his narrow understanding of the appropriate ap- plication of hypnosis in traumatic recall as well as the military stance of his clinical approach made him, in this case, a very poor therapist and a disastrously poor researcher. In spite of the data, in spite of the lack of MUFON UFO JOURNAL support for his own beliefs and in spite of the consistent and unshakeable story which Betty and Barney Hill told both in and out of hypnosis, Dr. Simon was unable to shed his pre- judices and preconceptions both in the therapy sessions themselves and in the conclusions to which he came. His work provides a paradigm of the practitioner skilled in some areas of therapeutic work who assumes that such skill prepares him for different work which requires significantly dif- ferent, highly specialized information and experience. Such a therapist can be expected to botch the case just as Dr. Simon did. He can also be ex- pected to use the therapeutic equivalent of blaming and name- calling to relieve himself of respon- sibility for the poor outcome that his ill-equipped state made inevitable, again just as Dr. Simon did. Such a therapist then labels the patient with pathology where none (or lesser levels of disturbance) exists, consistent with Dr. Simon's conclusions. None the less, while the cautionary lesson is clear, it is also clear that the progres- sion of perceptions and participants which occurred in the Hill case is the one which we see today in the development of our thinking about alien abduction. After the Hills shared their ex- periences with a public divided in its receptivity, there was little active public focus on the abduction prob- lem. A book or two (like The An- dreasson Affair, Fowler, 1979) ap- peared, but the subject failed to pro- duce much serious concern. Here and there a supermarket journal might pick up the theme but the issue lay dormant (and/or non-existent) in the main. However, in 1981 Budd Hopkins courageously published Missing Time and attracted the atten- tion of a wide segment of the public. He had found (and was found by) a diverse and interesting group of peo- ple who, like Betty and Barney Hill had had strange and improbable NO. 261 JANUARY 1990"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"experiences of various troubling kinds. They were unable to sort out and understand pieces of their lives, scars on their bodies, portions of their emo- tional and reproductive experiences, phobias, dreams and so forth which affected (and afflicted) them pro- foundly. They had, like the Hills, segments of time missing and, like the Hills, were distressed and concerned about the unknown and unknowable quality of what they perceived to be anomalous in their lives. Phillip J. Klass (Alien Abductions, A Dangerous Game, Prometheus, 1988) soundly castigates pioneering investigators like Hopkins and David Jacobs for what he deems their temerity and hurtful interventions with abductees. But without their work and writings, papers, etc., those properly trained in the work of assisting in the healing of wounds would likely never have noted the need. Their role in alerting and sensitizing the therapeutic community to this area of concern cannot be overestimated. It is to the credit of the therapeutic community that in slowly but steadily swelling numbers they are confronting this set of therapeutic issues, seeking training and making networking connections with one another to assure the quali- ty and depth of treatment necessary for optimal service to the population which has been abducted either ex- perientially or by physically real creatures in.nuts-and-bolts type crafts. Collaboration The abductees he worked with were assisted by Hopkins in the preliminary investigation of their ques- tions and then, because he knew that delving in the mind, unlocking the trauma and opening the gates of memory is serious business not undertaken casually by either the curious or the unprepared, he sought out Aphrodite Clamar, a PhD in ac- tive clinical practice. She carried out the session in her office with Hopkins present as an observer. With the con- sent of the patients, the material from these sessions formed the core of Hopkins' first book on alien abduc- tions. Thus, Hopkins worked within the structure of an appropriate col- MUFON UFO JOURNAL laboration between himself and a skilled clinician. In doing so, he set up a serviceable model for future work. A therapist is trained to recognize serious mental disturbance, suicidal ideation, depression of various sorts, and psychopathies of a wide variety in all of their manifestations, the ex- istence of serious warning signs of im- minent or delayed crisis and so on. If these intrapsychic realities were in- tuitively obvious, special training would not be required to learn to discern them. The therapist has the resources to medicate a patient if ap- propriate or to hospitalize a patient if necessary (or arrange for such treat- ment if he is not medically licensed). Especially if the therapist is a medical- ly trained person, familial, personal arid social histories, including an ex- haustive review of systems and a reproductive history is of special significance. The casual association of two seemingly unrelated complaints may provide to the trained and at- tuned ear crucially important informa- tion which the patient, and the abduc- tion researcher, may miss completely. Of course, the same is true on the other hand as well. The clinician may not be competent to carry out a thorough alien abduction research program. The time which he spends dealing with patients is time which the investigator can spend investigating other aspects of the case. Again, casually available events, facts and perceptions may provide valuable clues for understanding the phenomenon which the investigator recognizes as patterns from his studies and research. Thus, just as a thoracic surgeon and a cardiologist may both serve the needs of the same patient, they do so best if their effort is col- laborative, not competitive. The thoracic surgeon working closely with the cardiologist must become deeply informed in the other's specialty, but he does not become a specialist by enlarging his base of information to include that of his colleague: he mere- ly becomes a better collaborator. It is to the benefit of the patient to be served by the most skilled person available, not by an interested worker in another area whose passion for understanding and good intentions leads . him to practice a partially NO. 261 JANUARY 1990 mastered skill. In one respect whatever one believes the origin of the abduction experience to be makes no significant difference: the clinical indications for treatment of some sort of post- traumatic-like symptions are frequent- ly abundant in this population. Peo- ple who experience themselves to have been abducted by aliens are often in severe emotional pain regard- ing many aspects of the experience. They agonizingly question their own sanity, previous life organization and coping strategies, self-esteem and the capacity for intimacy which they have achieved, their life history and the basic safety with which they may (more or less) confidently predict the course of the ordinary arid expectable events of their lives. If the abduction victim has indeed been the object of repeated (but par- tially or totally repressed) alien depredations from early childhood on, there is abundant reason to de- mand that the most highly skilled at- tention will be brought to bear on the toxic and pervasive impact which such trauma, like the most malignant sort of child abuse, can be expected to have had. The nearly breathtaking capacity of people to cope, to. com- pensate, to make do, to keep on keeping on in the face of abysmal hurt is amply and heroically demonstrated by the survivors of domestic and social tragedy on every scale. Love, tenderness, humor and resilience manifest themselves comingled with despair, anguish, pain, irrational repetitive and avoidant behavior and isolation. But the cost is also stagger- ing: it requires a well trained, compas- sionate and skillful therapist to deal with the narrow and broad spectra of impact in such a case. We know from the clear data presented by studies of the survivors of traumatic events that treatment is possible, but true resolution is difficult unless the clinician is specially skilled. We also know that the effects are long term, multigenerational and very damaging when the abuse has been sustained, pervasive, repressed and repeated. The children of the victims of such trauma also become victims. They are at high risk for being deep- ly hurt through either the symbolic or PAGE 11"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"explicit repetition of the trauma suf- fered by their parents. They are also at risk for the damage sustained through being nurtured by parents whose own early lives make the in- timacy and trust of the parent-child bond more difficult to create and sus- tain. These are certainly appropriate areas of intervention for the skilled and specialized talents of a therapist. Therapy is indicated here: the mere uncovering of the repressed material which constitutes the traumatic events is not sufficient. Truly, the real trauma comes later in the damage sustained in the emotional, psychosocial, intra- psychic and interpersonal realm of the abductee's long-term experiences in life. But even if the events have not oc- curred through such depredation we are still facing squarely the realm of the specialist. Few who have wit- nessed first hand, or elicited through their own efforts, the unfolding of first- hand stories of alien abduction can re- main unconvinced of the genuineness of experience which the story-teller is living. The fears are real, the tears are real, the terror is real and the ex- perience is real. These affects and concepts come from somewhere and must be accounted for. Let us assume that their ultimate origin is entirely within the psyche of the patient. Then, like a dream of terrifying con- tent and reality, they represent signifi- cant parts of the unconscious life of the patient metaphorized and con- cretized for the sake of expression. They are associated with fears, phobias, symptomatic behavior of other sorts. Like any intrapsychic con- flict they reside within the internal landscape of the patient and they call out for therapeutic assistance. The same distortions which, ac- cording to this hypothesis, create the scenario must be addressed by a therapist if the patient is to be free of the burden of such conflicts and distress. There can be no doubt that these affects are charged with intense emotion and themselves are deeply hurtful to the patient if unresolved. Further, if there is a weakening of the reality testing apparatus because of the intense charge which these con- flicts and feelings carry, then there is yet more reason that a therapist, PAGE 12 (whose domain includes affect and its processing) must be the treating per- son. The discrimination between states of intact and faulty reality testing, unravelling of the strands of conflict and distortion, should be the careful, cautious and informed work of therapy. This work simply cannot be carried out by an untrained per- son, no matter how well motivated, intuitive, caring or loving such a per- son is. In fact, the very qualities of deep involvement, fervent advocacy and personal championing which make some investigators such assets to the investigative procedures must be addressed by the qualified therapist. It is not the task of an in- vestigator to monitor his counter- transference, but the therapist is re- quired to do so continuously and unremittingly for the good of his patient. But these divergent focuses and re- quirements are the stuff of which ac- tive and fertile collaboration between therapist and investigator can come. It should be noted that only those cases which pique the interest of an investigator will demand such col- laboration. It is the task of a therapist to treat patients who require it whether their case material is more or less exciting than another patient's. This represents yet another distinction between investigators and practi- tioners of the healing arts. In- vestigators have the luxury of focus- ing on \"interesting cases.\" Therapists treat people in need of help whether their stories are \"new\" or not. Whether or not investigators find themselves eager to pursue a par- ticular case, they should regard themselves as morally and ethically bound to offer competent referral to a therapist for the unweaving of the twisted strands of abduction-related experience from the tapestry of the patient's life. Reweaving that tapestry is the work of the ensuing therapy. I assume that both therapists and investigators can be found who are in- telligent, compassionate, deeply con- cerned about the people with whom they work, intellectually rigorous and possessed of boundless energy. But these qualities alone are no substitute for the skills of a professional. The specific diagnostic skills, longitudinal MUFON UFO JOURNAL perspective, clinical experience and objectivity which we can demand of a therapist are not to be had by good will alone. They come from study, ex- perience, supervision, scholarship, the upholding of licensure standards and both required and voluntary continu- ing education. It is beyond the scope of this paper to address the differences between a superb therapist, an ade- quate one and an inadequate one, and a considerable body of literature exists which concentrates solely on these distinctions. Suffice it to say that caution, recommendations of others knowledgeable in this area and a watchful eye kept open until a trusting and solid therapeutic alliance has been established are as essential here as in any other therapist/patient relationship. And it is well to remember that the general skill base of any competent, compassionate therapist alone is riot sufficient to assure that the correct choice of a therapist has been made. Special training is necessary to treat anomalous trauma. Alien abduction reports are anomalous in several im- portant regards, including the problem of the difficulty of knowing with cer- tainty whether the trauma has taken place at an event level of reality or an experiential one. But clearly, trauma has taken place in the life of the sufferer. For many peo- ple reporting abduction experiences, there has been significant trauma. Post- trauma-like states are a clinical reality in this population and require a skilled response. The pain and anguish, help- lessness and vulnerability, panic, sense of unsafely, developmental impairments, low self esteem, sleep disturbances, disorders of mood and psychosexual damage which may oc- cur must be dealt with carefully. Coping If the coping mechanisms of the pa- tients are adequate at the time of evaluation, then no therapy would be required. But such a judgement is not a casual one. Therapists spend years learning to make the distinction be- tween when therapeutic intervention is appropriate and when it is not. And the results of such evaluation may not be the same as an uninformed or NO. 261 JANUARY 1990"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"casual, although well meaning, assessment. There is a massive dif- ference between the investigation of trauma (whatever its origin) and its treatment. Unearthing events, feel- ings, trauma, etc. frequently does result in the temporary lightening of the symptom burden of the patient. People sometimes do feel better sim- ply when repressed affects are de- repressed. But these derepressed af- fects and experiences have not been kept out of awareness without deep and significant impact on the entire life of the patient. Such impact is rarely consciously known to the patient, so the answers to superficial questions in- tended to evaluate functional level may be superficially intact-sounding, while the unconscious reality may be that such intact functioning is being achieved only through great internal cost and compromise. These hidden traumatic affects pro- foundly impact upon personality structures, interpersonal styles, pat- terns of intimacy, panic, anxiety and phobic responses (which may be designed to ward off these intolerable feelings), mechanisms of ego defense, the sense of self, sexual responses, cognitive systems, communication skills and a myriad other aspects of the ways in which people put themselves together. And each of these areas is profoundly shaken by the release of these affects. It is not sufficient to derepress material, offer a little counseling, some words of comfort and call it a day. And yet reports abound that there are non- therapists active today who do just that. Investigators sometimes feel that their task is research alone and elicit material with scant attention to the issues addressed in this paper. Sometimes they are available for warm and friendly contact and com- fort, sometimes they are not. Sometimes the abductee is offered one or two sessions of an hour or so duration in which a bolus of material is uncovered. Follow up may be light to absent. Further contact may be non-existent. In many cases there is neither a support system nor therapeutic contact available post session. Sometimes a patient is assumed to MUFON UFO JOURNAL be in \"good hands\" after such a level of exploration because he or she is, after all, in therapy. But therapy with a therapist unlearned in this particular area does not necessarily guarantee a suitable outcome for the patient. The scenarios of abuse and tragedy by therapists who, while well- meaning, are totally unprepared to deal with post traumatic disorders (an area of special skill in itself), let alone post abduction sequelae, are legion. It is the responsibility of therapists to learn enough to either become fully competent in the treatment of these experiences or to learn how, when and to whom referrals may be made. But it is in three way collaboration be- tween investigator investigating, therapist treating and the patient giv- ing permission and active assistance in the sharing of information that this work is properly carried out. There are two more areas in which the needs of the patient are not well served when investigation takes the place of therapeutic treatment and in- quiry. The first is protection for pa- tients. When Abraham Flexner made his landmark report on the state of medical education in the United States in 1910, he decried the sorry state of competence assurance ex- isting at that time. Patients were without means to verify that the claims of competence made by their physicians were accurate, that these practitioners had attended or com- pleted (satisfactorily or otherwise) any training in the medical arts at all, that they were using tested, safe or ap- propriate treatment modalities or that they were accountable for their deeds (or misdeeds) in any appropriate way. There was no redress for malprac- tice, indeed, a clear definition of malpractice did not exist. Out of this lamentable state of affairs the modern North American system of profes- sional education, training and licen- sure was created. While the individual qualities of each practitioner is still a variable, a minimum level of com- petence, accountability and ap- propriate practice is guaranteed by the licensure system. Membership in pro- fessional societies is, in most cases, maintained only when continuing professional education is accom- plished. Licenses can be suspended NO. 261 JANUARY 1990 or revoked for the protection of the community. Practitioners are, in general, covered by malpractice in- surance, making redress in the form of compensation through litigation possible should it become necessary. Licensed practitioners must maintain (and must protect) their licenses, hospital privileges, academic appoint- ments, institutional affiliations, membership in professional societies and their reputations within the pro- fessional and lay communities. Men- tal health professions are skilled in the ongoing use of supervision. Therapists are accustomed to engag- ing other members of their own pro- fessional community in supervision to assist them when they encounter dif- ficult case material. Investigators do not, in general, make use of this model of conduct, nor are they trained to recognize when it would be appropriate. And by whom would they be supervised? By other investigators, similarly un- trained in therapeutic considerations? Because they are licensed by the state, therapists are subject to peer review. Their conduct can be scrutinized and their competence and practices can be adjudged impaired if that is the case. These are heavy burdens for professionals and responsible practi- tioners regard them with great gravity. Unfortunately, investigators are free of these burdens. Although some have academic and other institutional appointments, they are not account- able for their clinical actions in the same way since their professional responsibilities lie in non-clinical areas. But these burdens of licensure, in- surance coverage, hospital, academic and clinical appointments and con- tinuing education all protect the pa- tient, the patient's family and the general level of practice of therapy in the community. Without them, the patient not only has no recourse to remedy of various sorts should the clinical situation go badly, there is no method to assess competence available and no legal, ethical or moral obligation to provide high quality care over as long a period of time as ap- propriate. Even these safeguards pro- vide only an imperfect safety net, but without it, there is no guarantee whatsoever of any degree of quality PAGE 13"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"assurance in the clinical skills offered to the abductee undertaking to deal with his internal life. Paid What investigators can and do of- fer to abductees is the opportunity to be \"treated\" without charge. Since they are not licensed or trained in the area of therapy, scrupulous in- vestigators like Hopkins and Jacobs do not receive monetary reward directly from the patient for their labors. They are, however, in- vestigators who investigate. They in- crease their understanding through this investigation, enlarge their data base and, in the case of the reputable and prominent workers, share their in- creasing knowledge in appropriate and highly useful ways. But they are paid for their labors. Authors are paid to write books and hope to make money from this activi- ty which, in a society like ours, is deemed only right, proper and fitting. Academics write and publish papers, deliver talks, write scholarly and non- scholarly books, teach courses, get tenure, receive promotions, media coverage and may make money from the books they write, too. Television and radio talk shows, movie rights to books, lectures and other activities at- tendant on the writing of these books generate income through fees, royalties, advances, direct sales and other pathways. These are appropriate rewards to offer to investigators who write, to writers who investigate. Such in- vestigators are privileged to be able to earn part or all of their living through their work with abductees, Yet, curiously, a strange idea has somehow been generated that although it is appropriate for in- vestigators to earn their living through the exercise of their particular skills, it is not similarly appropriate for therapists to be fairly compensated for a similar exercise of their skills. The feeling has somehow developed that it is not appropriate for a therapist to be fairly compensated for the time he expended in the exercise of abduction-related therapy since the investigators \"will see me for nothing.\" This represents a shocking, pro- PAGE 14 found and highly inappropriate devaluation of the skill and training of- fered to patients by members of the professional community. All of us who are engaged in the treatment and study of alien abduction experiences realize that, whatever the locus of origin we assign to this phenomenon, we are potentially dealing with a prob- lem of enormous dimensions. The clinical needs of a potentially large population will not be adequately met by the volunteer efforts of the small number of enthusiastic therapists who are in a position to donate a smaller number of sessions to an even smaller number of cases. Indeed, too much eagerness to offer too many hours of cut-rate or free therapy may signal a novice or inadequate therapist and should provoke caution. Instead, we can predict that a significant portion of the hours available for the clinical services of a significant number of well trained and highly skilled practitioners may come to be required to deal with the abduction phenomenon. If we are to engage the sustained commitment of a large number of highly trained and competent profes- sionals in treating these experiences, we must face the reality that the com- mitment of resources to them for their time and skill is only just. Professionals in private practice earn their livings through the allotment of their time. If we are to involve practitioners of a high level of competence, we must expect them to value their time fairly and support that assessment. Time allotted to one patient cannot be allot- ted to another. Treatment is demand- ing of the therapist and requires sus- tained, simultaneous and careful at- tention to a huge number of cues, realities, questions, ideas, feelings, diagnostic considerations, clinical decisions, etc. Many psychotherapists make the decision to reduce or eliminate our fees on occasion for humanitarian reasons, but that must be left to the discretion, financial ease and personal choice of the practitioner here just as it is in any other area of clinical practice. In order to have the option of choosing the finest doctor available to us we are, as a society, accustomed to making choices in a free market. We expect doctors to make a living MUFON UFO JOURNAL through the use of their clinical skills. Like investigators, psychotherapists, too, are entitled to use their skills in a climate of fair compensation and patients are entitled to assistance at the highest levels of competence. Abduction research is a field rich in puzzles and the opportunity to in- crease our understanding of ourselves and our world on many different levels. Tragically, there is no dearth of case material. The area has plenty of room for good minds and different areas of specific competence. The alien abduction phenomenon presents, in fact, too large a picture for any one of us to see alone. But I believe that it is essential for workers in the newly emerging study of Anomalous Trauma to respect scrupulously the special areas of ex- pertise which people in different disciplines, using divergent focuses, can bring to this field. Central to this effort, of course, is the patient whose \"interesting case\" acts as the bridge linking the therapist and investigator. Both therapist and investigator will, of course, be engaged in a process of research and this is best carried out from a stance of close collaboration. But the investigator is not a therapist and must refrain from acting as if he is one. Therapists and investigators can supplement, support and \"cross- pollinate\" each other through fruitful and appropriate collaborative efforts. Therapists and investigators are prac- titioners in two quite separate areas of specialization. Each specialty needs to inform and educate the other in open cooperation.

During the past decade or so, evidence has been accumulating that the U.S. Government was involved in retrieving crashed UFOs and their oc- cupants. A major outlet for these types of cases first surfaced in the summer of 1978, when Ohio re- searcher Leonard H. Stringfield presented 17 abstracts reviewing 'Retrievals of the Third Kind,' cases of alleged UFOs and occupants in military custody, at the Mutual UFO Network's annual symposium held in Dayton, Ohio that year. Critics of Stringfield's paper argued that because his informants wished to re- main anonymous, it was virtually im- possible to verify their claims. He con- tinued his quest for more details on the UFO crash retrieval question, and published subsequent updates in 1980 and 1982. But spectacular claims require extraordinary evidence, and Stringfield's anecdotal evidence was insufficient to prove the case. In 1980, noted linguist Charles Berlitz and UFO investigator William L. Moore released a book, The Roswell Incident, that described how the military intervened and kept secret from the American public the recovery of a crashed UFO and oc- cupants outside Roswell, New Mex- ico in 1947. The case was recently re- examined on the September 20, 1989 episode of NBC-TV's \"Unsolved Mysteries,\" which highlighted several witnesses to the investigation and one informant. The informant, Sappho Henderson of West Hills, California, told how her late husband, Captain Oliver Wendell Henderson, was the pilot who flew the saucer wreckage in the Air Force plane to a base in Dayton, Ohio. Walter G. Haut, who was public-relations officer at Roswell Army Air Force base in July 1947, also appeared on the show, and verified that wreckage from a flying saucer was recovered by the Air Force. In September 1989, UFO research- er Jerome Clark indicated that at MUFON UFO JOURNAL By T. Scott Grain, Jr. least three dozen new informants have been interviewed, and that the \"Roswell incident is surrendering more and more of its secrets, in- cluding the biggest ones.\" Investigators for the J. Allen Hynek Center for UFO Studies are making some in- teresting discoveries, and hopefully a report of their findings will be released in the near future. More Support Support that a UFO did crash near Roswell was^ bolstered up again in 1987, when English writer Timothy Good published for the first time al- leged official U.S. Government documents outlining how twelve men working for the U.S. Government or- chestrated the recovery and evalua- tion of a crashed disc that was re- moved from Roswell, New Mexico, in July 1947. A similar release of this so called 'Briefing Document: Operation Majestic 12' occurred several weeks later in the USA by the research team of William L. Moore, Jaime H. Shandera and Stanton T. Friedman. According to the documents, MJ-12 was a group of distinguished scientists, military and intelligence of- ficials, established by President Harry Truman to control the recovery of UFOs. Newspapers around the globe reported the allegations that the United States Government covered up a UFO crash landing and recovered its occupants. But no of- ficial spokesman would confirm that any of this was true. How does one prove MJ-12 exists and the documents are real? Canadian UFO researcher and nuclear physicist Stanton Friedman, was awarded a $16,000 grant by the Fund for UFO Research to answer that question, and he has generated a great deal of information to support the validity of the documents. Unfor- tunately for Friedman, and the rest of the research community, all the original designated MJ-12 members are dead, so any confirmation must NO. 261 JANUARY 1990 come from second hand information or by locating other supporting documents to prove the case. A pro- gress report of his investigation was made at the 1989 Mutual UFO Net- work symposium, held in Las Vegas, Nevada. Friedman reported there is \"... no indication that the documents are fraudulent and a host of small details which tend towards legitimacy for MJ-12.\" Working on the assumption that the Majestic-12 documents are authentic, Canadian UFO researcher Grant Cameron and I found an an- chor in which to conduct our own in- vestigation. We decided to pursue people, not documents. Since the Briefing Document clearly states the project is a \"TOP SECRET Research and Development Intelligence opera- tion\" responsible to the President of the United States, Cameron and I went fishing for former members of the R & D Board who were active during the late 1940's and early 1950's. Someone out there had to have knowledge of a project of this magnitude. During our hunt, we discovered another researcher who had been do- ing a similar check, William Steinman in California. Steinman, author of the book, UFO Crash at Aztec, had been corresponding with Fred Darwin, the former Executive Director of the Guided Missile Committee for the Department of Defense's R & D Board from 1949 to 1954. Steinman asked Darwin who would be likely candidates for a flying saucer recovery operation, if there ever was such a project. His reply is extraordinary, considering he named these people in 1984, three years before the Majestic-12 documents were made public. Darwin listed the following names: 1.) Dr. Vannevar Bush 2.) Dr. Karl T. Compton 3.) Dr. Lloyd Berkner 4.) Dr. Robert F. Rinehart 5.) Dr. Eric A. Walker 6.) Dr. John Von Neumann PAGE 15"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"Bush and Berkner both appeared on the Majestic-12 list in 1987. One name that came up that we found in- teresting was Dr. Eric Walker, former President of Pennsylvania State University. The fact that Walker might have been involved originated with American physicist Dr. Robert I. Sar- bacher. In the 1950's, Sarbacher was serving as a consultant for the military's R & D Board and was a member of the Guidance & Control panel. In a September 15, 1950 interview with Canadian scientist Wilbert B. Smith, Sarbacher told Smith flying saucers exist, we have not been able to duplicate their performance, and the subject of flying saucers is classified two points higher than the H-bomb. When the contents of this 1950 interview were made public through one of Leonard Stringfield's monographs, \"UFO Crash/Retrie- vals: Amassing the Evidence-Status Report III,\" in 1982, Steinman managed to find Sarbacher in Palm Beach, Florida, and wrote him for more information. In a letter to Steinman dated November 23, 1983, Sarbacher con- firmed he was \"... invited to participate in several discussions associated with the reported recoveries, ...\" (of UFOs) but that he was unable to attend the meetings. Sarbacher stated that U.S. laboratories analyzed the material that reportedly came from these flying saucer crashes and that the hardware was \"... extremely light and very tough.\" Sarbacher described the be- ings that controlled the flying saucer to Steinman. He states: \"There were reports that in- struments or people operating these machines were also of very light weight, sufficient to withstand the tremendous deceleration and ac- celeration associated with their machinery. I remember in talking with some of the people at the office that I got the impression these \"aliens\" were constructed like certain insects we have observed on earth, wherein because of the mass the inertial forces involved in operation of these in- struments would be quite low.\" In an October 1985 issue oi Flying Saucer Review, editor Gordon PAGE 16 Creighton gave further details about Sarbacher's involvement in his article, \"Top U.S. Scientist Admits Crashed UFOs.\" Creighton writes that although Sarbacher didn't attend, the meetings about the recoveries were held at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton, Ohio, where officials were to report their findings to scientists con- nected to the Defense Department's Joint Research and Development Board. Walker During a telephone interview be- tween researcher Stanton Friedman and Robert Sarbacher, he asked Sar- bacher if he could recall anyone who attended those meetings. Although he could not recall his name, he named enough clues to Friedman, that when William Steinman review- ed the conversation, all the evidence led to Dr. Eric A. Walker. In the early 1950's, Walker was serving as Ex- ecutive Secretary of the Research and Development Board, and would have been a logical candidate to be asked to attend UFO retrieval meetings, if they were held. In a letter to Grant Cameron, Steinman said that when he made the discovery, he tele- phoned Sarbacher and asked him if Dr. Eric Walker was the individual he was trying to remember. Sarbacher's response, according to Steinman, was Walker was the man who attended all those meetings at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base. If the evidence we have gathered is true, we now have identified a scientist who was in a position to con- firm or deny the U.S. Government's crash retrieval program. Steinman states he telephoned Walker on August 30, 1987. According to Stein- man's \"word for word\" telephone transcript of the interview, Dr. Eric A. Walker confirmed attending these meetings at Wright-Patterson AFB regarding the \"military recovery of fly- ing saucers, and the bodies of oc- cupants.\" According to Steinman, Walker acknowledged that he knew of MJ-12, and was familiar with it since 1947. In the interview, Walker tells Steinman to \"leave it alone,\" that he is \"delving into an area that you can do absolutely nothing about.\" Steinman responds that the people have the right to know the truth, and that he is \"... not going to drop it.\" Steinman has been investigating Walker since 1984, and received several letters from Walker, one of which discusses a downed saucer. Grain and Cameron teamed up in the fall of 1987, to learn as much as we could about Walker's involvement, before releasing his name to the public. Although Dr. Walker is being less responsive these days regarding in- quiries into his past involvement with UFOs, Cameron and I believe we have gathered enough background material on Dr. Walker to show he was in the right place at the right time to know if the United States had a crashed UFO in military custody. A report of our findings has been assembled in a book, UFOs, MJ-12 and the Government, which we hope to release in the near future.

Todd I can no longer stand by and allow Stanton Friedman's proclamations to go unchallenged. I am convinced by Friedman's various MJ-12 papers and articles that he is more interested in keeping MJ-12 alive and kicking, than he is in reporting his alleged research accurately, honestly and objectively. Indeed his papers and articles contain distortions, exaggerations, and in some cases what appear to be outright deceptions. He has managed to reduce his writings to little more than pro-MJ-12 propaganda, and in the process runs the risk of implicating himself as a willing co-conspirator in the perpetration of a hoax. In the September 1989 issue of The MUFON UFO Journal, Friedman proclaims in his \"progress report\" on MJ-12 that \"None of the objections [to MJ-12 and the MJ-12 documents] raised to date appear to hold up.\" Despite the obvious conviction with which he makes his statement, it is patently untrue. It's almost as if Stan believes that his making the statement makes the statement true. At best, he expects the world to accept what he says as gospel, and many in the UFO research community are doing just that. In the August 1989 issue of The MUFON UFO Journal, Dennis Stacy reported on the speakers' presenta- tions at the Las Vegas MUFON Sym- posium. According to Stacy, \"Fried- man recounted that thus far the con- troversial MJ-12 briefing document, along with the so-called Cutler- Twining and Truman-Forrestal memos, continue to hold water.\" Let's examine the Cutler-Twining memo and the circumstances surrounding its alleged \"discovery.\" First, let's examine the evidence that proves almost con- clusively that the Cutler-Twining (CT) memo was planted in Record Group 341. The CT memo is obviously out of place among the files in which it was \"found.\" It purports to be a carbon copy of a memo from the National MUFON UFO JOURNAL Security Council (NSC) intended for Air Force General Nathan Twining. Presumably, the original of the memo went to General Twining. If so, what is a carbon copy of an NSC memo doing in retired Air Force Intelligence files? The thought that the NSC sent an extra copy to Twining simply isn't rational. Likewise, the thought that the NSC sent a carbon in place of the original is equally ludicrous. The CT memo is filed in entry 267 of Record Group 341. The records in this entry are identified by their Top Secret register numbers. The CT memo does not bear such a number. The number would have been placed on the document by the Air Force, not the NSC, where the memo allegedly originated. More importantly, the records among which the CT memo was located were reviewed by both Air Force reserve intelligence officers, and staff members of the Archives' Records Declassification Division. In a letter dated March 16, 1989, Ed Reese, Friedman's primary Archives contact, informed me that: \"In none of these reviews was the Cutler-Twining memorandum iden- tified as present and requiring any special attention. But the declassifica- tion guidelines used by both the Air Force and the National Archives per- sonnel would not have permitted them to declassify National Security Council documents. If discovered in the files during any of these reviews such a documents [sic] would have been withdrawn and provided to a National Security Council declassifica- tion specialist for final determination. It was never so identified.\" The purpose of the declassification reviews was to assure that no classified documents would be made available to researchers. As Stan Friedman will agree, the Air Force had only a general knowledge of the documents contained in these files. As a result, the Air Force and Archives reviewers would have to perform a document- NO. 261 JANUARY 1990 by-document review. If such a review were conducted, the memo would have turned up and would have been recognized as requiring special atten- tion. As Reese pointed out, neither the Air Force reviewers nor the Ar- chives reviewers would have been permitted to declassify an NSC document. Planted? As indicated in his writings, Stan Friedman would agree that the CT memo almost certainly had to have been planted by somebody. The question is, Who? Stan Friedman proclaims that the most reasonable theory is that so- called \"insiders\" planted the memo in the files for Moore and Shandera to find. He wants — and expects — us to believe that certain elements within the MJ-12 organization conducted some kind of surveillance on Fried- man's research activities, learned of his interest in Record Group 341, ordered the CT memo stolen from one high-security area at one federal facility and planted in another high- security area at another federal facility. In addition, he apparently expects us to believe that these alleged inside sources also went to Ethiopia to pick up a couple of postcards, wrote teas- ing clues on the postcards hinting at the whereabouts of the CT memo, and then flew off to New Zealand to mail the postcards. In short, Stan's theory requires us to believe a laun- dry list of improbable — and un- proven — events. I contend that the circumstances surrounding the alleged \"discovery\" of the CT memo point to the most likely suspects: Bill Moore and Jaime Shandera. After all, Friedman himself has claimed that Moore and Shandera were the first researchers to examine these files following the of- ficial declassification review in 1985, a review which failed to detect the presence of the CT memo. In fact, for PAGE 17"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"reasons that mystify me, Friedman makes this claim to show that an out- sider couldn't have planted the memo. The apparent implication is that both Moore and Shandera are above suspicion. Since they are above suspicion, and since they were the first researchers to examine these files and the first to discover the CT memo, the only explanation left is that an insider planted the memo for Moore and Shandera to find. As an argument against suspecting Moore and Shandera of planting the memo, Stan Friedman asked me several of what he calls \"kind of rhetorical questions.\" (I suspect they were \"kind of rhetorical\" because he thought it sufficient to raise the ques- tions, neither expecting nor wanting answers. It would seem he feels that by his stating the questions alone, his points are proven by the questions themselves.) For example, Stan asked why, if Moore and/or Shandera planted the CT memo at the Ar- chives, did they go to all that trouble? Why not just mail the CT memo? He points out that this would have been cheaper than two guys going from California to Washington, D.C. The fact is, there are several excellent reasons. First, Stan himself has told us why Moore and Shandera were at the Ar- .chives. Stan had learned of the ongo- ing declassification review of Top Secret Air Force Intelligence files in Record Group 341. He also learned, through my request for the formerly Top Secret report entitled \"Analysis of Flying Object Incidents in the U.S.,\" that UFO-related documents exist among these files. Moore and Shandera were at the Archives because they were looking for Top Secret, UFO-related Air Force In- telligence records. • They certainly weren't there to find the CT memo, since Friedman has already reported that they didn't catch on to the alleged clues on the alleged postcards until after they \"found\" the CT memo. Consequently, the expense of two guys going from California to Washington, D.C., can't be cited as a reason why Moore and Shandera wouldn't have planted the memo in the Archives. But that leaves the question of why, PAGE 18 if Moore and Shandera created the CT memo, didn't they simply mail it to themselves and claim it was sent anonymously? Alternately, they could have simply created the document and claimed that one of their alleged \"inside sources\" gave it to them. This avoids entirely the single most impor- tant reason for planting the CT memo in the files at the Archives. If the CT memo had been mailed to Moore or Shandera by an anonymous source, or even if they had claimed it had been furnished by one of their alleged \"inside sources,\" the memo would have been just another suspect document that could not be verified. Although the team of Moore, Shandera and Friedman seem to feel that if a document can't be proven to be a fake, it must be real, more discerning researchers tend to treat documents supplied anony- mously as fake until proven authen- tic, which is not to say these research- ers ignore these documents and make no attempts to authenticate them. But by planting the CT memo in the files at the Archives and feigning \"discovery,\" the illusion is created that the document is absolutely authentic. While the Archives cannot say the document is a fake, they are in the unenviable position of having to cer- tify that the document was indeed \"found\" among their holdings, despite their own misgivings which they have listed in a report filed with the docu- ment itself. Critical Evidence There is no other way to turn a completely fake document into a seemingly genuine document. After all, the document was \"found\" in the official files of the Air Force housed at a government facility. And once the document surfaces and gains accep- tance as genuine, it would show clear- ly that something designated \"MJ-12\" existed and had close links with the President, the NSC and government personnel Moore, Shandera and Friedman long ago identified as the most likely people to be involved with crashed saucers. Although the CT memo isn't explicit in terms of crashed saucers, it appears to verify the ex- istence of MJ-12 as an organization, MUFON UFO JOURNAL and by implication would tend to sup- port the even more suspect doc- uments Moore, Shandera and Fried- man claim were supplied to them by their alleged \"inside sources.\" It would be a deviously clever plan. Although it makes no explicit reference to crashed saucers, the importance of the CT memo can be understood if you think in terms of where the other MJ-12 documents — and the MJ-12 story itself — would be without the CT memo. It remains a critical piece of evidence, both for and against MJ-12. It may be that Moore and Shandera are merely the victims of circum- stance. Nevertheless, the circum- stances surrounding the alleged discovery identify them as the most likely suspects. I didn't invent the circumstances. Now, let's look at the other facts that offer more than enough reason to have what Jean Sider calls \"con- vincing suspicions\" that the document isn't genuine. One of the most apparent problems with the CT memo is the classification marking, \"Top Secret Restricted,\" which appears in the upper, right- hand corner of the memo. I recog- nized the marking as suspicious, and so did Barry Greenwood. But more importantly, the personnel at the Eisenhower Library also saw it as suspicious, and in their July 13, 1987 letter to me listed the classification marking as one of the reasons they believe the CT memo is a fake: \"The classification marking on this memorandum is one we have never seen on an Eisenhower Administra- tion document. \"Top Secret\" and \"Restricted\" are two different levels of classification. There neither is, nor ever was, a classification level known as \"Top Secret Restricted.\" The use of \"Restricted\" as a classification mark- ing was discontinued in November 1953.\" It should also be pointed out that when \"Restricted\" was in use, it was the lowest classification level in ex- istence, while \"Top Secret\" was the highest. I ask who the authority is here: The Eisenhower Library personnel who work with these records day after day, or self-proclaimed expert Stanton T. NO. 261 JANUARY 1990"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"Friedman? I believe the answer is ob- vious. The classification marking on this document is sufficient reason to suspect the CT memo of being fake. Furthermore, the onionskin paper on which the CT memo was typed bears a watermark. So far as I am aware, Stan Friedman has failed to locate even one other official onion- skin prepared by or for Cutler which bears such a watermark. Doesn't it strike anybody as odd that of all the Cutler correspondence Stan Fried- man claims to have reviewed, not one of them was on the same onionskin paper on which the CT memo was written? Granted, the fact that Fried- man has found none does not prove conclusively that none exist. But with all the other irregularities surrounding this document, it certainly can be taken as one of Jean Sider's \"convinc- ing suspicions.\" Granted, too, is the fact that not all NSC materials have been examined to see if they contain carbons made on this particular kind of onionskin paper. But what constitutes a reasonable search? Stan Friedman won't be satisfied until every scrap of paper at the Eisenhower Library has been examined. With that kind of logic, it could never be proven that this single CT memo is the only document on this kind of paper. If all NSC records were to be examined, and none were found to have been prepared using this kind of paper, Stan Friedman would simply turn around and say that the government obviously didn't allow access to all NSC documents. And in his opinion, when it comes to a choice between believing the government and believ- ing Stan Friedman, Stan Friedman wins hands down. Another \"convincing suspicion\" that the document is not genuine is the fact that it was prepared as if in- tended for Robert Cutler's signature. As it turns out, Robert Cutler was overseas between July 3rd and July 15th and couldn't possibly have either prepared or signed the original. We know nobody signed the carbon, which may be one reason a carbon was used instead of the original. With a carbon, one wouldn't necessarily ex- pect to find a signature thereby reliev- ing the forger of the risky chore of MUFON UFO JOURNAL attempting to forge an acceptable signature. Stan Friedman points to an earlier Cutler memo which asks Cutler's associates, Coyne and Lay, to keep things moving out of his basket. Fried- man states that the CT memo mere- ly advises of changes in an already scheduled meeting, and that either Coyne or Lay would certainly have the authority to send such a memo for Cutler. This is true. But what is also true is that both men had the authori- ty to prepare the memo over their own names, especially considering that Cutler was out of the country and the change in schedule was a relative- ly trivial administrative matter easily handled in a straightforward manner. But neither of their signatures appears on the memo, nor is there any indica- tion that either man signed for Cutler. Even though Stan Friedman con- tends that Cutler instructed his staff to keep things moving out of his basket, and Friedman also contends that either Coyne or Lay could have prepared the memo in Cutler's absence, to my knowledge, Stan has failed to find even one other docu- ment dating from the time of Cutler's absence which bears Cutler's name, as if intended for Cutler's signature. Since Cutler instructed his staff to move things out of his basket, either Coyne and Lay used their own signatures on other documents prepared for Cutler, with the CT memo being the single exception, or there weren't any other Cutler documents that needed to be moved out of his basket. Since Stan de- scribed the NSC as a virtual paper mill, and implies — as does the earlier Cutler memo — that Coyne and Lay would have to handle at least a moderate amount of Cutler's paper- work for him in his absence, it doesn't seem likely that Coyne and Lay handled only the one matter ad- dressed in the CT memo. I asked the Eisenhower Library to look for other records for the period of Cutler's absence to see if there were any that might have been handled by Coyne or Lay but displayed Cutler's name, as if intended for his signature. While cautioning me that their check was limited only to the most obvious files in their holdings, and included NO. 261 JANUARY 1990 only open, declassified materials, they stated: \"Our search did not locate any documents in this limited time period with Cutler's name on them, except for Cutler's memo to Lay and Coyne of July 3, 1954 (a memo which he apparently wrote before leaving for Europe).\" The July 3, 1954 memo instructed Coyne and Lay to keep things mov- ing out of his basket. In the absence of any other documents from this time period that bear Cutler's name, I must conclude that the most likely explanation is that the forger did not know Cutler was out of the country and that no other such documents exist. Despite Stan's proclamations to the contrary, this re- mains the most reasonable explana- tion for the facts available to us. Stan Friedman would have us looking for other documents for the rest of our lives, documents that, in my opinion, probably do not exist. We could report to Stan that we searched every scrap of paper in the Eisenhower Library, and he would reply, \"Well, obviously the documents are somewhere else.\" And then another massive search would ensue. Stan Friedman goes to incredible — literally — lengths to divert suspi- cion from the CT memo, and from Moore and Shandera. In his Las Vegas paper, for example, he says he reviewed a number of documents and that \"A number of items were stamped Restricted Security Informa- tion. I found one stamped Confiden- tial Restricted Security Information, and I found another one that was ap- parently labelled Secret Restricted Security Information.\" Later he claims that he \"sent a few items [to Philip Klass] with RESTRICTED SECURI- TY INFORMATION, CONFIDEN- TIAL RESTRICTED SECURITY IN- FORMATION and SECRET RESTRICTED SECURITY Informa- tion [sic].\" The obvious implication of his statements is that these documents somehow show that the \"TOP SECRET RESTRICTED\" marking on the CT memo is legitimate, thus eliminating one objection to the document. Stan furnished me with copies of these same documents. Even a casual PAGE 19"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"review will show that the markings on these documents undoubtedly were the result of regrading actions by the government, either upgrading or downgrading. The original classifica- tion markings were left on the documents and the new markings were also applied. Not one of these documents show a combined classification, such as that found on the CT memo. What's more, and worse, the nature of the reasons for these markings are so obvious that any attempt to portray them as anything other than the results of regrading actions has to be the result either of gross incompetence or deliberate deception. I leave it to Stan to select the phrase he considers most appropriate. I don't believe a compe- tent researcher could make an honest mistake by interpreting the meanings of these markings in any other way. The assertion or even the suggestion or implication that these markings somehow validate the markings of the CT memo is completely without merit. Stanton Friedman's papers cannot be relied upon to present an accurate picture of his research and conclu- sions. I caution the public to take Friedman's conclusions with a ton of salt. His assessments and evaluations sometimes are as spurious as the MJ-12 documents themselves. He is not an objective investigator, research- er or reporter. While this article has concentrated on the Cutler-Twining memo and Stan Friedman's questionable reporting, numerous problems exist with the other MJ-12 documents, and with MJ-12 as a whole. Although Stan Friedman has proclaimed these prob- lems solved, the reality is that they have not been solved. The sheer number of irregularities associated with MJ-12 and the MJ-12 documents should convince any reasonable per- son that, in all likelihood, MJ-12 is a cosmic hoax. Did Huge Triangle Shaped UFO Abduct Two U.S. Jet Fighters in Puerto Rico? By Jorge Martin MUFON - Puerto Rico Since 1987 the island of Puerto Rico has been the scene of an impor- tant wave of UFO sightings and CE- III's. It all began after a mysterious underground explosion and tremor in the region of the municipalities of La- jas and Cabo Rojo, at the island's southwest corner. In this report I will try to summarize one of the most rele- vant events — the encounter of two jet fighters with a huge UFO and their disappearance after being abducted in mid-air by the strange craft, an inci- dent that was witnessed by dozens of people who couldn't believe their eyes. The Incident The night of December 28, 1988 developed normally until 7:45 p.m., when many residents of the Maguayo, Betances, Olivares, and Sabana Yeguas communities of the towns of Lajas and Cabo Rojo witnessed something they will never forget. Among the witnesses were Mr. and Mrs. Wilson Sosa and their family, Mr. Charles Manuel Mercado and his family, Mr. Edgardo Plaza and his wife PAGE 20 Carmen, and many others who were at that moment at a store on Luis Monoz Marin street in the Betances area, in Cabo Rojo, and on Road 101, that goes from Lajas to Boqueron, Cabo Rojo, a coastal resort area. Many others observed what hap- pened; the encounter and disap- pearance of two U.S. jet fighters, from the Olivares and Vertedero sectors of Lajas, and would be able to give more details of the UFO. All witnesses stated that the UFO was triangular shaped and totally silent. Some of those who saw it from the Lajas sector assured us that \"it seemed to have some kind of ex- tended appendage in its frontal sec- tion with many brilliantly colored lights constantly blinking on and off.\" Mr. Wilson Sosa, resident of the Betances community in Cabo Rojo, who is a UFO investigator and a great collaborator of ours in this area, ex- plains what he, his wife and children experienced: \"Starting at 6:00 p.m., we were seeing jet fighters passing over the area. At 7:45 p.m. or so, we heard some others that were either from the Puerto Rico National Air MUFON UFO JOURNAL Guard or from the U.S. Navy. Even though they were high you could still clearly hear their engines. I was pay- ing strict attention to their fly-over because about a week before another one of those jets, an F-14 or F-15, chased another UFO, a small one, over the Sierra Bermeja (a small mountain ridge) and the Laguna Car- tagena (a lagoon), sites related to many of the UFO incidents that have been occurring in this area since 1987. I came out to watch them and then saw that big UFO flying over the Sierra Bermeja. It was enormous! Humongous! It was blinking with many colored lights. I ran and got my binoculars. I could clearly observe that it was triangle-shaped and slightly curved at its rear side. \"It made a turn back and then came over, lower and appeared much larger. It was then that we noticed two jet fighters were directly behind it. When the UFO went to the west, one of the planes tried to intercept it and passed in front of it, at which time the UFO veered to the left and made a turn back, reducing its speed. The jets had tried to intercept it three times, NO. 261 JANUARY 1990"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"and that's when the UFO decreased its speed, almost stopping in mid-air. It was incredible! How something that big could remain almost motionless in the air was unbelievable. Considering its size, it must have been very heavy. The second jet remained at the right side of the UFO while the first one positioned itself at the UFO's left rear side. \"Then ... I don't know exactly what happened ... if the jet entered the UFO by the rear, by its rear upper side ... or what. That's when we all yelled because we were afraid there would be a collision and maybe an. explosion due to it.\" Sosa continued: \"The jet in the back just disappeared on top or inside the UFO, because I was seeing everything through my binoculars and it didn't come out from the rear, the upper side or the other sides. I said to myself 'Good heavens; what hap- pened? It disappeared!' The second jet remained very close to the right side of the UFO. It looked very small alongside that huge thing. As the UFO flew a little to the west, the jet disappeared, as well as its engine sound. This was identical to what happened when the first jet seemed to disappear inside the UFO. \"That UFO was huge! I tell you that that ship was bigger than this com- munity's baseball park. You could observe its gray metallic structure and great central yellow light that was be- ing emitted from a big bulging luminous circular concave appen- dage. At the triangle's right 'wing' tip it had brilliant yellow lights, and on the left one it had red ones.\" (See Sosa's drawing of the UFO as he recalls it.) These details were noted with the aid of his binoculars apparently. After trapping the jets it lowered its position and came very close to the ground over a small pond known in the area as Saman Lake. It stood still in mid-air for a moment ... then straightened its corners and gave off a big flash of light from the central ball of yellow light. It then divided itself in the middle into two different and distinct triangular sections! It was just incredible! The triangle to the right was illuminated in yellow, and the other one in red. That's when they both shot away at great speed, one MUFON UFO JOURNAL to the southeast, and the other one toward the northeast, toward Monte del Estado. \"You could see red sparks falling from it when it divided itself,\" explained Sosa. Mr. Carlos Manuel Mercado, another resident, related what he saw: \"My wife Haydee yelled to me 'Manuel, come, run quickly. Look what's coming there!' As I came out to see, Wilson (Mr. Sosa) was calling me too. Then I saw that huge thing like a big light ... at first I couldn't identify what it was. It had a very bright yellow light that almost blinded you, a great yellow light, like a giant spotlight. \"Suddenly, I saw two planes com- ing ... each one at the side of that thing. When they got nearer to that ship ... which I drew here (see draw- ing by Mr. Mercado) ... one of the jets came and crossed in front of that thing to the left and the other one crossed in front of it from left to right. Then, when they got next to it, we thought that they would collide with it. It stopped in mid air! ... the jets seem- ed to go inside of it and that's the last we saw of them. Then that thing ... it must have been a ship ... because it was real big ... it then veered back and that's when we noticed that it looked like a triangle. It had some lights on both sides and a great ball of light in the middle, from where the yellow light was emitted. When it veered and stopped over the Saman Pond, it divided itself and one of the sections shot away at great speed to the east and the other one took off to the north. Those jets seemed to be trying to intercept that thing, force it to change its course, which they did on three occasions, until the thing stopped and trapped them. It grabbed them and took them both away! To me that's what happened. \"I was real nervous, because that thing was so big, and it was coming straight in our direction, and I shouted 'Those jets are going to collide with that!' ... but instead they seemed to throw themselves into it ... and they just disappeared! At the same mo- ment the noise of their engines stopped. We couldn't hear them anymore.\" \"It was like something out of a science fiction movie, incredible,\" said Mrs. Eduviges Olmeda, resident of NO. 261 JANUARY 1990 the Finquitas de Betances residential sector. \"From our balcony we could see everything. Those planes were circling and getting in front of that thing with the big yellow light ... it was beautiful! ... and suddenly it stopped and the planes seemed to disappear inside of it.\" Mr. Edwin Olmeda, hus- band of Eduviges, gave his account of the incident: \"That certainly was a UFO, and it was really big. It was glowing with a big yellow light and didn't make a sound as it flew over the area, but the jets did. You know, we recently moved to this place, and this is the second occasion we have seen UFOs over the area. The first one was about three weeks ago, and it was like a flying saucer but shimmer- ing with light. Something is going on around here.\" The details given by the Olmedas and their children about the incident and the UFO's description are similar to those given by the other witnesses. More Accounts Ivan Cote, a young resident in the Sabana Yeguas sector of the town of Lajas, explained what he saw: \"That was between 7:00 and 8:00 p.m. I was in the yard and all of a sudden I saw this huge thing like a triangle with big lights and many similar blink- ing colored lights. Then some military jets arrived and began, I would say, to try to corral that thing, and there were other smaller red luminous ob- jects that were around the triangle and were circling it and seemed to be pro- tecting it from the planes. I really think that thing is what people call a UFO, a flying saucer. Suddenly the planes seemed to enter or be sucked into (it) ... I thought there would be an explo- sion, a collision ... but they just disap- peared. I couldn't see them or hear them anymore. \"Then another jet came, but it flew away, apparently because they saw what happened to the other two, and got lost in some clouds while the smaller UFOs with red lights were chasing it. That is all I saw. Those jets did disappear. My grandmother, Josefina Polanco, saw it all, too, be- cause I called her out to see.\" Ivan's account was important, because it made clear that the big PAGE 21"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"UFO was apparently being escorted by a number of smaller UFOs which were trying to prevent the jets from getting too close to it. But, whatever happened to the jet that escaped be- ing chased by the smaller UFOs? We have not been able to get more infor- mation on it. Youngsters Juan and Jeffrey Acosta, as well as their family, residents in the Vertedero sector of Barrio Olivares, in the town of Lajas, also saw what happened, repeating the details given by all the others. They also made us a drawing of what they saw that night (notice the similari- ty to the drawing made by Mr. Mer- cado). The Acosta family stated that \"that thing was much bigger than the jets. Those jets seemed like mos- quitoes next to It,\" said Juan. Cover-Up Right after the incident happened, some of the witnesses called me to in- form me about it. Having the hour and details of the incident, I called the Federal Aviation Administration office in Isla Verde, where my call was politely attended by a supervisor by the name of Ed Purcell. After inform- ing him about the incident he stated that the FFA knew nothing about any UFO incident in the area or any inci- dent as the one described, but that they were informed that \"there was some military movement down in the southwest region in Cabo Rojo and maneuver operations were being done by personnel apparently from the Roosevelt Roads Naval Base, in Ceiba.\" At the Puerto Rico National Air Guard Muniz Base, also at Isla Verde, we were informed that they knew nothing of the incident, but that if it indeed happened none of their in- terceptors had anything to do with it because none of their jets were flying that night. We later verified their in- formation with an inside source. The same information was given to us from official sources at the Cam- pamento Santiago National Guard base in Salinas, at the island's southern part. Representatives of the F.U.R.A. (Fast Action United Forces), a special air police force commissioned to fight PAGE 22 against drug smuggling by air radar unit at San German stated that they had no knowledge of such an inci- dent, but showed real interest in it. They told us, as well as a high rank- ing officer of the Criminal Investiga- tions Corps of the Puerto Rican Police Department in the western zone, that they had noticed that a lot of combat jets were seen overflying the western zone at low altitude over areas not commonly seen before. But, we received a big surprise when we called the next morning, Thursday, December the 29th, to the Roosevelt Road U.S. Naval Base in Ceiba. After asking to talk with some- one in the air operations division of the base, we were attended by a gentleman by the name of Burdsey, supervisor of air operations. After in- forming him of the incident he responded: \"That's absurd! It's not true, it's ridiculous! What's more, for better proof, I can tell you that we did not have any personnel in that area either day or night on Wednesday, yesterday. Whoever said that is wrong because it's not true. They must be wrong.\" We explained to the officer that many people from the area that we personally knew as serious persons called us giving the same details, and he insisted in saying that \"... they couldn't have seen that because it's not true. The whole version is absurd.\" Due to his answer we called back to the Federal Aviation Administration office at Isla Verde to check if they knew anything on such an incident or a UFO report (even though we knew that they have a rule not to say anything to the media about UFOs). An officer by the name of Mirabal received our call. He knew nothing about the incident, but he assured us that\"... there were air practices in that area in Cabo Rojo last night. Wednesdays are the official days for practices in that sector, and it is of- ficially notified to the Administration as such.\" He couldn't explain why Roosevelt Roads Base denied having any jets down there, but he assured us that for all he knew they had air military movement in that area on Wednesday night. Interestingly, later that day I called back to the F.A.A. and another officer MUFON UFO JOURNAL there (who asked me not to give his name) assured me that \"I don't know anything on that incident you are talk- ing about, but even so, whenever there is an incident related to UFOs we are not allowed to investigate it, a special investigation is done by a special division of the F.A.A. station- ed in Washington, D.C. ...\" I was really surprised at his statement because this was the first time, as I recall, that an F.A.A. officer stated that they do in- vestigate UFO sightings and incidents. Definitely, there is an obvious con- tradiction in the information given to us by the F.A.A. personnel and the one given by the Roosevelt Roads Base officers. Someone is not telling all he knows on the matter, as ap- parently they want to cover-up this important incident ... and this hush- hush attitude emanates from Roosevelt Roads Naval Base. But this is not over yet ... Black Helicopters On December 29, we went to Cabo Rojo and Lajas accompanied by our friends Jose Reyes and his wife Damaris. We interviewed the already mentioned witnesses, as well as many others whose accounts of the in- cidents are similar to those already described here. Up to now there are more than 60 witnesses of the inci- dent. When we talked to Mr. Carlos Rocafort, supervisor of Air Operations at the El Mani Airport in the city of Mayaguez, next to Cabo Rojo, he stated, (knowing nothing about the in- cident), that on Wednesday, Dec. 28, at 8:30 p.m. (let's remember the inci- dent happened at 7:45 p.m.) a small military Cessna airplane arrived at the airport with 4 individuals who, as rumors said, \"were going to in- vestigate something important that had happened in the area.\" Looking in the Cabo Rojo - Lajas for more independent witnesses we talked to Mr. Aristides Medina, a retired veteran of the U.S. Army and a resident in La Parguera, a resort area, who told us that: \"At about 8:20 p.m. a bunch of black helicopters ar- rived, and for hours overflew the Sierra Bermeja and the Laguna Car- tagena areas without any lights. They did that until about 12:00 a.m. They NO. 261 JANUARY 1990"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"seemed to be searching for something in that sector. Apparently they tried not to be seen, and were flying low. They definitely were looking for something there, maybe the planes that the UFO took away or some kind of trace. Apparently they were equip- ped with infrared equipment, and that could explain why they were not us- ing any lights in the search.\" At dawn, after the choppers left, five U.S. Navy ships and one U.S. Navy carrier were stationed some 15 miles out in the Atlantic ocean just in front of the area known as the Cayo Margarita. They have been stationed at this location for quite sometime. Comments The multiple testimonies and witnesses, all of them independent from one another, and from different sectors in the Cajo Rojo - Lajas region, indicate that the incident of the UFO encounter and the subse- quent abduction-disappearance of the two U.S. jet fighters did happen on that night of Wednesday, December 28, 1988, at 7:45 p.m. over the Laguna Cartagena in Cabo Rojo. I must add that there is a possibility that the jets that were abducted were not from the Roosevelt Roads Base, but that they were instead from the U.S. carrier that was stationed some 20 to 25 miles out at sea at that moment. It is very possible that this carrier is the one that helped the U.S.S. Iowa after its unfortunate accident north of Puer- to Rico (16-inch gun turret explosion). A week after the incident I was able to talk to a Navy Officer here on the island [whose name I can't give for obvious reasons]. He informed me that \"There are radar tapes that show what happened, and they were classified at once and sent to Washington, DC to be analyzed. We were able on the radar systems of the ships that were stationed nearby to see what happened. We saw when the smaller targets on the radar, which represented the jets, merged with a bigger one [the UFO]. After that the big target seemed to split and shot off at great speed. A lid has been placed on the whole incident. Many things like that have been happening, but we are not allowed to comment on MUFON UFO JOURNAL anything we see. Many strange things are happening in the waters of Puer- to Rico that should be known.\" I must say that there is a great amount of information on UFO in- cidents here on the island of Puerto Rico that seem to indicate that there is some kind of struggle currently go- ing on between the U.S. military and UFOs. Finally, the local government \"leased\" the area at the Sierra Bermeja and the Laguna Cartagena to the fed- eral government and another exten- sion of the area is currently under con- trol now of the federal government, under the excuse that they are organiz- ing a Voice of America Radio Station in the Sierra Bermeja zone. But to the investigators and residents in the region the real and obvious reason seems to be that they are controlling the area in order to give a constant follow-up to the UFO presence there. Conclusion This is an important case, because if it can be officially proven that those two jets disappeared and some kind of official documentation on the in- cident can be found through the use of the FOIA, then, as you know, the government would have to make a statement on the reality of the event, and therefore on the reality of UFOs. Somewhere in the United States four families were notified of the disap- pearance of their relatives [the pilots of those jets] on 28 December 1988, and some kind of documentation per- taining to those notifications has to ex- ist somewhere. For all I know, Naval Intelligence is in charge of the in- vestigation of the incident and the jets disappearance, so that agency would be a very good place to start sending requests through the FOIA. This case is a solid one due to the fact that there are more than 60 independent witnesses of the incident which can't be easily denied. I hope MUFON can work out this important case as pro- fessionally as it has always done in the past, because I'm sure that many more facts will emerge from it.

Looking Back by Bob Gribble FORTY YEARS AGO - Jan- uary 1950: Dr. B. was driving on a highway in isolated Bahia Blanca Pro- vince, Argentina (exact date unknown), when he saw a metallic- appearing, disc-shaped object resting on the ground just off the road to his left. He stopped the car and watched the craft for a few moments. Except for a flashing light on top, nothing transpired, so he decided to approach it. There was an opening in the side and he looked in. A red light was pulsating in the dome at one-second intervals, but the vehicle seemed to be empty, so he crawled through the small opening. Inside, he looked around and im- mediately saw that the craft was not deserted — there were three small NO. 261 JANUARY 1990 men in the circular enclosure. One sat at what appeared to be a control chair in the center, and two were lying on lounges along a curved wall. Another curved couch was empty. All three were dressed in brown tight-fitting overalls that exposed only the hands and the face; their feet were encased in some kind of boots. Dr. B. estimated they were about four feet tall, their skin a tobacco-brown, their eyes light colored. He could not distinguish colors too well, for the light was not good. In front of the little man in the center chair varied-colored rays were playing across what looked like a television screen, on top of which was a rotating globe of glass or other transparent material. Dr. B. touched one of the beings, PAGE 23"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"which felt rigid. It was then, he said, that he got the feeling he was in the presence of some kind of alien life. He rushed out of the vehicle, got to his car and sped off, not stopping until he reached his hotel about 75 miles away, where he related the incident to friends. The next morning Dr. B. and some friends returned to the landing site but the disc was gone. They did, however, find a pile of gray ashes which were warm to the touch and which turned their hands green on contact. Hovering overhead was a cigar-shaped craft with two small disc-shaped vehicles nearby. A few seconds later, the two discs merged with the larger vehicle, which then turned a blood-red color and went in- to a high speed vertical climb and out of sight in a few seconds. For weeks afterward Dr. B. suffered from a strange skin irritation, fever and blisters. *** THIRTY FIVE YEARS AGO - January 1955: Dr. V. Hajek, a Czechoslovakian engineer, and his wife were returning to Melbourne, Australia, from a motorcycle trip to Adelaide on the llth when a strange event occurred. \"Midway across a small bridge outside Torquay I heard a dreadful noise. I thought the bridge was collapsing, and as I turned my head I saw out of the corner of my eye an object like a large metal pro- peller rotating at high speed,\" Hajek said. \"It was making a noise much louder than a Vickers-Viscount jet. The noise seemed to be super- imposed on a sizzling sound of high pitch. \"A clearer view of the craft, which was traveling at a speed between 700 and 800 mph about a quarter of a mile from me and approximately 300 feet up, showed me that it was ellip- tical and highly polished. It was slight- ly blurred because of the rotating mo- tion, but it gave me the impression of a large propeller spinning at terrific speed.\" Dr. Hajek estimated the vehi- cle as about 40 feet in diameter. It was in his sight for about 12 seconds. It climbed rapidly, leaving no vapor trail. Mrs. Hajek supported her husband's statement. PAGE 24 *** THIRTY YEARS AGO - Jan- uary 1960: On the third, Bishop G. Bromley Oxnam, of Washington, D.C., in a sermon in Baltimore, Maryland, concluding the week-long 175th anniversary of the Methodist Church in America, said we will come to know the people who populate the great planets of the universe in the not too distant future. \"The future will at least be a period of stretched minds, with fundamental readjustment in the world of philosophy, and of course, theology,\" he said. \"Before another 175 years have passed, we will have conquered space and come to know the thinking, the culture, the dreams, the problems, the limitations of the people who populate the great planets of the universe. The next 175 years must be characterized by an in- tellect big enough to speak out a new philosophy, to use new power to create and maintain peace.\" *** TWENTY FIVE YEARS AGO - January 1965: There was a near- collision between a delta-shaped ob- ject and an aircraft at dusk on the third, as a four-engine Electra airliner operated by a major airline, was ap- proaching Washington, D.C. Several miles from the airport, the flight crew sighted what they thought was an or- dinary aircraft. Abruptly it turned and moved swiftly toward the Electra, a huge craft showing a black silhouette in the dusk. The Captain yelled out, \"What the hell is it?\" Suddenly, the vehicle turned away and disappeared at tremendous speed. Just after midnight on the 12th, Department of Justice Inspector Robert E. Kerringer was on patrol du- ty north of Lynden, Washington, when a bright glow suddenly lit up the ground. \"It was so powerful,\" Kerr- inger said, \"I could see farm buildings in the distance. I was about to stop and get out when this huge shining, thing swooped down, right over the car. The thing was round, about 30 MUFON UFO JOURNAL feet in diameter, but the glare was so blinding I couldn't see any details. I jumped out and saw it hovering above me. I was so rattled, I pulled out my revolver, but something kept me from firing.\" The disc remained over the car for about three minutes, then began to move, climbing faster than any jet and disappearing into the clouds. About 20 hours later and eight miles west of Lynden, at 8:20 p.m., a mother and three daughters at Custer, Washington, watched while a huge glowing object descended from the sky and landed near their house. The intense light illuminated the sur- rounding area, including the side of the house and the yard. The craft re- mained grounded for several minutes, then ascended vertically in a burst of speed and disappeared. Investigators found, in the 16 or so inches of snow, a large circular imprint about 10 to 12 feet in diameter, while the ground beneath the melted snow ring showed evidence of having been scorched. Oval-shaped tracks eight inches long and eight inches apart, in single file, were found leading from the landing site to a clump of evergreens, where they disappeared. *** TWENTY YEARS AGO - January 1970: Mrs. Doreen Kendall, RN, reported she saw a bright, circular object about 50 feet in diameter, con- taining two human-like occupants, hover only 40 feet from the hospital where she worked in Duncan, British Columbia, Canada. Mrs. Kendall said the two male-type figures were inside a brightly-lit dome on the disc-shaped craft. She said she had gone into the extended-care wing on the second floor of the hospital to examine a pa- tient around 5 a.m. on the first. The nurse pulled back a curtain by the bed and found herself looking at the glow- ing dome of the craft, stationary in the air opposite the children's ward, one floor above her. It was slightly tipped downwards towards her, 40 feet away, and 60 feet off the ground. At first she could only see the up- per halves of the figures inside, but NO. 261 JANUARY 1990"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"when the vehicle later tilted she got an even better look. Kendall said the craft was silvery and metallic, with a \"necklace of lights\" around the mid- dle. The two figures inside the dome had \"strikingly good looking physi- ques,\" and were clothed in tight-fitting uniforms of a soft-looking material. One stood before a glowing, chrome- colored instrument panel while the other, either shorter or standing in a recessed spot, stood behind him. Both had stools to sit on, she said. The vehicle emitted no sound. After a few moments, the second occupant, sensing he was being watched, turned to look directly at her. He was wear- ing a darkish fabric, similar to his uniform and headgear, which ob- scured his facial features. He touched the \"pilot\" with his ungloved hand, which was flesh- toned and human-like. The pilot pulled back, forward, then back again on a control lever and the craft tilted sideways, affording Mrs. Kendall an excellent view of the interior. She said the dome appeared to be lit from below rather than from above. She added that she felt no fear, but called out when it appeared the vehi- cle was about to leave. Mrs. Freda Wilson, another nurse, arrived a step ahead of five other hospital employees who watched the craft cir- cle slowly and finally disappear to the north. Mrs. Kendall said the vehicle seemed to almost touch the patio out- side the hospital, and in size spanned about five hospital windows. *** FIFTEEN YEARS AGO - January 1975: The strange object came in from the west about three in the morning and landed in time to be seen by a passing car about 60 feet away. George O'Barski was driving near North Hudson Park in New Jersey, just across the Hudson River from Manhattan, New York. It was the week of the 12th. On this particular morning, O'Barski, 72, was taking an accustomed shortcut, listening to his car radio, when static began to in- terfere with the music. He slowed down, fiddled with the dial, then heard on his left a droning sound. A bright, large object flew by on the MUFON UFO JOURNAL other side of a row of trees, traveling in the same direction as his car. In seconds it stopped, hovering about 10 feet above the ground. The craft, he said, was about 30 feet in diameter, flat on the bottom, with vertical sides and a domed top. Its maximum height was about eight feet. It was surrounded with regular- ly spaced vertical windows, a foot and a half wide and an equal distance apart. The vehicle itself was dark but intense light shone from the windows, illuminating the ground nearby. As the craft hovered, a ladder apparatus ap- peared at one side, a vertical door opened, and uniformed figures descended. There were at least nine of them, each clad in a light-colored coverall and about three and a half feet tall. Their faces were not visible because of some kind of helmet. He kept his car moving slowly, but the be- ings paid no attention to him. Each carried a large spoon-like tool and a little bag with a handle. They moved quickly, spooning the dirt into their bags. In a few moments they were back inside, and the vehi- cle ascended, moving north. O'Bar- ski, at his closest, was 60 feet away. The entire incident took place in less than four minutes. The next morning George went back to the park and walked over to the spot where the craft had landed, one mile west of Broadway, in downtown New York City. There, in a small area, were about 15 little holes, about five or six inches deep. On Thursday morning, January 15, 1976, at 3:00 a.m., almost exactly a year after the first landing, a UFO landed in the same spot. Two witnesses observed the landing; neither knew about the January 1975 sighting. (Editor's note: This is the case that motivated Budd Hopkins to become interested in the UFO phenomenon.) *** TEN YEARS AGO - January 1980: As the sun set at Ansted, West Virginia, dogs started barking wildly outside The Sandwich Hut restaurant. Norma White, the owner, and several customers ran to the door. All said they will never forget what they saw. \"It looked like a great white planet NO. 261 JANUARY 1990 with white lights. A strip along the bot- tom was Y-shaped,\" Mrs. White said. \"The ship itself looked like a great big ball covered with tiny red lights. The whole thing had a greenish hue.\" More than 200 residents subsequently reported seeing \"space ships\" hover- ing overhead since the first of the month. Residents say they have seen smaller craft launched from a mother ship, about six at a time. In a matter of minutes, there would be 12 or 18 smaller craft around. When all of the satellites rejoin the carrier, \"It shoots straight up and disappears.\" (Editor's note: Norma White is a former State Section Director in West Virginia and now resides in Salisbury, MD.) Ansted Police Officer Charles Crosier said, \"I saw red globes flying around the mountains to the east and south of town. They were flying low over the trees on the ridge line and would suddenly shoot directly up at a tremendous speed. I counted a dozen, about 20 feet in diameter. There were no wings and no sound.\" Motorists have reported disc- shaped craft, larger than jets, flying under the new river bridge. One motorist said: \"I was driving down the road when I saw white lights low in the woods. My cruise control went out and my digital clock stopped working. I pushed the gas pedal but the car wouldn't go. Then, all of a sudden the car took off at 80 miles-per-hour.\" Residents say their dogs act as if they're going to have heart attacks each time the objects appear. \"These are all competent people who have seen these,\" according to Police Chief Jim Hall. \"They're not kidding. They're telling the truth. There's no doubt that something is happening here.\" SUPPORT UFO RESEARCH PAGE 25"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"The Night Sky By Walter N. Webb February 1990 Bright Planets (Evening Sky): Jupiter (magnitude -2.5), retrograding westward in Gemini, stands high in the east at dusk. The giant planet remains visible in the southern half of the sky most of the night. It lies 4° below the gibbous Moon on the 5th. Bright Planets (Morning Sky): Early in the month four of the bright planets and two telescopic ones (Uranus and Neptune) mass together in the same constellation, Sagit- tarius, low in the SE dawn sky. The brightest planet, Venus, unmistakable at magnitude -4.5, achieves greatest brilliancy (-4.6) later in the month on the 22nd. The Galileo Jupiter probe flies past Venus this month en route back to Earth in December — the two worlds giving the craft gravity- boosts toward its final destination. To the right of Venus are Mercury (-1.0) and Saturn (0.6). The former is nearly twice as bright at the latter. Mercury appears less than half a moon-diameter above the ringed planet on February 3. To the upper right of the pair stands ruddy Mars (1.3), which passes only a quarter of a degree below Uranus on the 9th, l l /2° below Neptune on the 17th, above the gibbous Moon on the 21st, and finally just below Saturn on the 28th. Jupiter gleams in the west after midnight, setting in the NW before 4 AM in midmonth. Total Lunar Eclipse: The Moon is full on the morning of February 9 and also happens to be eclipsed by the Earth's shadow. In the U.S. only Alaskans will be able to see the first half of the eclipse before the Moons sets. The Moon first contacts the dark umbral shadow at 8:28 AM AST. Totality follows at 9:49. Moon Phases: First quarter — February 2 •\") Full moon — February 9 Last quarter — February 17 New moon — February 25 The Stars: The midevening sky this month provides a good opportunity to practice angular measurements, using the star background. UFO investigators should be familiar with estimating angular altitudes and angular sizes when a witness points outs where he or she spotted an unknown object in the sky. The angle from horizon to zenith (the point directly overhead) is 90°. If the fist is held at arm's length, each fist-height up from the horizon is about 10° of altitude. A five-finger handspan, similarly, covers roughly 15° of sky. Sirius, the brightest nighttime star, lies due south at 9 PM. For midnorthern observers, the luminary is about three fist-heights or two handspans above the horizon — that is, 30° altitude. You can check some other known angles in the sky. For example, the Twin Stars Pollux and Castor are nearly 5° apart. Orion's three belt stars are 3° across, while the constellation's two brightest stars, Betelgeuse and Rigel, are separated by almost 19°. The V-shaped face of Taurus (the Hyades) is about 4° long.

For southern observers in February, the night sky's second brightest star, Canopus, can be found 37° below Sirius. Finally, did you know that both the Moon and Sun subtend an angle ( l /2°) less than that of an aspirin tablet or pencil eraser held at arm's length? Most persons overestimate by a large amount the Moon's apparent size. NO. 261 JANUARY 1990"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"In Memory of Dan C. Overlade, Ph.D. When anyone asked Dr. Dan C. Overlade, \"How are you?\" his standard re- ply was \"Fantastic, but getting better.\" Dr. Overlade's optimism and joy for life ended on December 15, 1989 when he died following a series of illnesses in a Pensacola, Florida hospital. The above response provided a real insight into the personal philosophy of this fine gentleman who dedicated his life to helping others both professionally and as a volunteer. Dr. Overlade was a MUFON Con- sultant in Clinical Psychology and Hypnotherapy. He conducted many of the hypnotherapy sessions in the Gulf Breeze area with abductees, including four experiences by Edward Walters. In preparation for publishing the fourth edition of the MUFON Field Investigator's Manual, Dr. Overlade submitted the chapter devoted to hypnotherapy. In only one year, he established himself as a leading authority in the UFO field among the professionals engaged in working with abductees. He attended Treat I and the Aspen, Colorado meetings and was scheduled to speak on this subject at the MUFON 1990 International UFO Symposium. Considering the impact that he has made in elevating hypnotherapy as a vital tool for profes- sional clinicians in ufology in such a short time, Dan Overlade's talent is going to be sorely missed. For those of us who had the privilege of knowing him per- sonally, the world has lost a true gentleman who had not fulfilled his intended mission in life. Sympathy has been extended to his lovely wife Renee and family for the premature loss of their loved one. Dan was 62 years of age. - Walt Andrus MUFON UFO JOURNAL NO. 261 JANUARY 1990 PAGE 27"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"Director's Message , By Walt Andrus The Calendar of UFO Conferences for 1990 may be indicative of the in- creased interest in the study of the UFO phenomenon as we enter the next decade. Without doubt, the printed news and electronic media have provided a resurgence in ex- posure. A Gallup Poll taken in 1990 would probably further confirm the validity of UFOs as viewed by the general public. The UFO book publishing business has flourished in this receptive environment. It has been very gratifying to note the large number of professional people who have volunteered their expertise through membership in MUFON to help resolve the greatest mystery of the space age. Most people find it dif- ficult to accept the U.S. Government's stated policy on UFOs after 42 years and are determined to learn the facts. It would not be presumptious, on my part, to predict that the revelations and answers to our questions will be forthcoming before the close of the 20th Century, based upon the pro- gress during the past decade. Network News Some members have delayed pur- chasing their MUFON Field In- vestigator's Manual pending the publication of the revised fourth edi- tion. Due to major changes in the 4th edition, the publication date has been intentionally delayed. Five hundred additional copies of the present 3rd edition have been ordered to main- tain continuity. The F.I. manual is an essential tool for all investigators, research specialists, consultants, and especially field investigator trainees planning to upgrade their status. Field Investigator Trainees who are ready to take the MUFON Field In- vestigator's examination are asked to contact their individual State Director for the exam or write to MUFON in Seguin, Texas. Shirley Coyne in Flushing, Mich, grades all the ex- aminations and forwards the results PAGE 28 to the appropriate people.
