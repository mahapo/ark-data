Against Theory M ost crop circle theories these days resemble sink- ing ships. Launched amid fanfare and high hopes, they have come to grief against those sharp-edged objects known as facts. The hoax theorists are in trouble, because they have not explained how the supposed hoaxers could create so many formations in so many countries, nor how they could change the biological and radiological characteristics of the plants and soil. There is now good proof that extremely anomalous changes do happen; it will be discussed in Section III, and presented in detail in the large report available from the Fund. The tabloid press has given much play recently to the an- tics of two senior citizens who claim to have constructed some of the formations with ropes and planks. __^ — Yet the two men have not produced a plausible explanation for anything more than a few crude- ly hoaxed formations. Their story is improbable, even taken at face value. For example, they told Today that they wore wire gunsights mounted on baseball caps to keep them moving in straight lines. But how could they use a gunsight on a moonless, or rainy, or misty night? One can't sight if one can't see. (The last crop circle I visited in England formed on a night so foggy it was like being inside a ping-pong ball.) Also, they neglected to explain how they made formations on hillsides. It's difficult even to walk in a straight line across a slope, let alone make an accurately delineated shape. And they have not explained why they made so many formations in highly complex and counterintuitive ways; one particularly baffling crop lay is shown in Figure 1. A hoaxer almost certainly would have started in the center and worked out- ward, yet the formation clearly was made working inward. And they claimed that they had been hoaxing for thirteen years without even their wives knowing. How two wives could miss thirteen summers of late nights, chapped hands, bug-bitten skin, dirty pants, mud-encrusted boots and burr- filled, sweaty socks, is a mystery matched only by the phenomenon itself. When one adds the fact that in some crop circles the plants all current theories are at some risk are bent several inches above the ground, and that there are striking biological and radiological anomalies in the plants and soil, it becomes clear that the hoax theory is so inade- quate that the only appropriate response to it is laughter. However, the debacle has produced one sobering lesson. It is becoming clear to me that hoaxes are not always so easy to distinguish from the real thing. When in England, I tried flattening a few bunches of wheat myself. Where the plants were green and the ground was soft, it was not dif- ficult to bend them without breaking them. Hoaxers could presumably do the same, though it would be difficult to do on a large scale. Thus it is risky to assume that one can tell a hoax from visual inspection alone. We need more rigorous tests; and in Section III I will discuss how we Americans have come a long way toward developing them. Of course the hoax-theorists aren't the only ones with a troubled theory. The alien-intelligence theorists are also in trouble, because they can only support their theory negatively — \"it's not a hoax, it's not a natural phenomenon, therefore...\" Yet no one has actually seen or photographed an alien spaceship making the formations, nor has anyone worked out what message they might be conveying. The plasma vortex theorists are in trouble too, because they have not publicly explained how natural confluences of air and electricity actually make the formations. Nor have ^__^_ they explained why they are occurring so dramatically at this particular time, and concen- trating in one particular area of the world. The earth-energy theorists are in trouble as well, because they have not explained what such energies are, nor shown how they would flatten the plants. Nor have they offered a well-designed study establishing the validity of their experimen- tal keystone, dowsing. All the theories are in trouble for another reason: the theorists have produced no publicly available body of facts which can be invoked in defense or rebuttal. Instead, each theoretical camp merely shouts that it is right, which convinces no one except the already convinced. Sadly, over the years the theorists have become increasingly calcified, while the phenomenon has glided serenely through its many changes. American cereology must not go this way. 1 The way to avoid an acerbic, empty debate is to avoid theorizing until substantial data has been collected and published. Before we propose complex answers, let us pose simple questions, and answer them thoroughly, in public. Here are some of the questions we should be asking: • What has actually happened to the plants? • Has the soil been altered chemically or radiologically? • How are the formations distributed in space and time? • Can we create reliable tests to distinguish genuine circles MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 282 October 1991"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"from hoaxed ones? • Do circles correlate with certain geological substrates? • Do circles correlate to topography, and if so, how? • Do circles correlate to ancient monuments? • Could we accurately reproduce these formations our- selves, in every significant detail? • Do the circles \"relate\" in any way to earlier hoaxed formations? • What correlations do the circles have to weather pat- terns and solar cycles, and sightings of luminous aerial objects? A program of asking basic questions would have been im- practical in America only a year ago, because there was no data publicly available. That is now changing, rapidly. American scientists have begun analyzing plant and soil samples harvested in the 1991 season, and have already made several astonishing discoveries, which I discuss in Section III. In Section IV, I discuss several of this summer's well- documented sightings of unexplained luminous aerial objects. Section II, which follows, prefaces this information with a brief history of the 1991 season, covering some of its most interesting and important formations. II. A Brief History of the 1991 Season The 1991 season began dismally, with the worst cold and rain England had experienced in decades. Compared to 1990, very few formations appeared in April and May, and only a handful in the first half of June. But the weather turned warmer and sunnier in mid-June, and at the same time, the crop circles returned in their accustomed numbers. This ap- parent correlation between the weather and the phenomenon suggests that the two are not unconnected. It makes sense, after all, to hypothesize that some climatic conditions are more conducive to circle formations than others, regardless of the ultimate origin of the phenomenon. Presumably, Dr. Terence Meaden, the meteorologist, has examined his data for an explicit weather correlation, but he has not published his findings. It would be most helpful if he did. Americans may think the 1991 season was disappointing compared to the 1990 season, because there has been relatively little publicity compared to last year. But this im- pression is false, for the 1991 season easily matched the 1990 season in terms of prolificacy and complexity. Final figures are not yet in, but it was quite clear to me, a visitor, that formations were appearing rapidly all over Hampshire, and in lower but also significant numbers all across the country. Toward the beginning of the summer there were many dumbbells, and at least four triple-circle formations (three circles/rings connected in a line), and at least three quadruple-circle formations, each sporting a \"claw.\" There was one double-dumbbell at Newton St. Loe, near Bath, and also five \"insectograms,\" three of them immediately adjacent to Stonehenge. (The hoaxers claimed to have made some of the insectograms, so for the moment I regard those formations with caution.) Photo 1. The Westwoods, Lockeridge, long oval formation. Formed July 29/30, 1991. Photo by Michael Chorost. Two significant new formation types were the long and short oval formations, also dubbed \"fishes\" or \"eyes\" (photo 1). Though simple enough from the air, the ovals proved to be technical and artistic masterpieces on the ground. Each was made in a complex series of steps, which are described at length in Figure 1. The interiors of the ovals were extraor- dinarily beautiful, because the plants were laid down in \"brush- strokes\" of varying directions and lengths. Each little area had its own fascination, because different problems had been con- fronted and solved in its manufacture. Not only that, the plants had been laid down in striking and counterintuitive lays. I felt like an ant walking through the brushstrokes of an eye painted by Van Gogh (photo 3). Once the phenomenon had made its first oval, it evident- ly \"liked\" it enough to make four more in the next ten days. There were two kinds, a \"long\" oval with the circles separated from the main body, and a \"short\" oval with the circles joined directly to its ends. It was stunning to discover that each long oval had a unique crop lay. The second long oval was laid lengthwise in one half and spirally in the other half; the third long oval was laid spirally all the way around, and sported a magnificent \"nest\" of densely twisted stalks in the center (photo 4). It is quite a mystery why the phenomenon would make the same shapes in different ways. The Barbury Castle formation was also new, but it was anything but oval (photo 2). It promptly sparked a gigantic debate over its genuineness. On the minus side, it lacked the ribs and complex layering usually present in complex formations. Terence Meaden argued in a letter to Sheldon Wernikoff that an early reconaissance of the formation showed that it looked like \"a thousand people had trampled it.\" One could suspect the army itself of carrying out a hoax, using rollers, theodolites, compasses, and night-vision gog- gles. But on the plus side, the plants looked the way they do in most formations a few days old, still crisply laid and accurately directed. The ratcheted spiral was especially im- pressive, since the plants were laid in numerous arcs and right angles without a single mess or miscalculation. Its overall precision was extraordinary. Many experts, including MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 282 October 1991"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Photo 2. The Barfoury Castle formation. Formed July 16/17, 1991. Photo by Busty Taylor. Busty Taylor and George Wingfield of the CCCS, believed it genuine. I myself thought that if it was a hoax, it was a very skilled one. Ultimately, the wrangling of the experts failed to settle the question. Every verdict had a political motive. Had Meaden given a positive verdict, he would have shipwrecked his own thesis of natural causation. Had Wingfield given a negative verdict, he would have shored up the hoax theory. As long as hoax-detection is a matter of aesthetic judgement and political exigency, there will never be a commonly ac- cepted way of identifying the \"bad apples.\" However, if we had an established set of radiological, botanical, and chemical litmus tests, we could end such wrangling. We Americans have made great strides toward creating such a battery of tests. In fact, we performed some of them on the Barbury Castle formation. Those results will be discussed in Section III. The number of formations increased dramatically toward the end of the summer, when the harvest was imminent. One of the most interesting formations was a representation of the Mandelbrot set, a two-dimensional graph made famous by chaos theory. Could it be a hoax? I can't judge, because it appeared after I left the country, and we have no samples. If it's genuine, its implications are obviously extraordinary, but no one is quite sure what they might be. The Mandelbrot set is a mathematical construct often associated with chaos theory; it is a plotting of various solutions to a set of equa- tions in complex and real numbers. It is special because its parts exhibit self-similarity at any level of magnification. Any given section is composed of an infinite number of tiny copies of itself. But obviously the -Mandelbrot set means something different in the wheatfields than it does in the textbooks, or, to put it more accurately, it acquires new mean- ings there. What they could be, I have no idea. But I was amused to see it, because I had been reading James Gleick's book Chaos during my last two weeks in the country. Though there were formations all over England (and the world), they appeared to cluster densely in the area around the Avebury stone circles, a close cousin of Stonehenge. I didn't know what to make of the rough correlation until I read Terence Meaden's new book, The Goddess of the Stones. 2 Meaden's book is an ambitious attempt to explain England's numerous stone circles and other ancient construc- tion in terms of crop circles. Meaden theorizes that crop circles had appeared in England five thousand years ago, which stimulated the awed Neolithic tribes to make copies in stone. I find this an intriguing thesis, especially in light of the fact that the last two seasons of crop circles have clustered densely in a tiny area containing Europe's most remarkable ancient constructions: Avebury, Silbury Hill, Windmill Hill, Barbury Castle, Adam's Grave, the White Horses, and the East and West Kennet Long Barrows. On a gross scale, there is a manifest, unmistakable, hit-you- between-the-eyes spatial correlation. However, Meaden assumes that the circles are naturally caused, and I find that difficult to accept. Perhaps there were circles then, but not naturally created ones, which were im- itated in the ways Meaden describes. Or perhaps there were no circles back then, and the modern phenomenon is relating itself to what is in the area, for unknown reasons. If so, the ancient structures themselves might form a \"social context\" within which the circles could be interpreted. But in order to fulfill this hypothesis, we would have to know a great deal more about that society. Sadly, it is exactly this we do not know. Many theories have been proposed to \"explain\" Avebury and Stonehenge, but none have been generally ac- cepted. So much of the past has been lost: we are like amnesiacs wandering around a city we ourselves built but can no longer remember. Unless we somehow recover our cultural memory, we probably cannot use Avebury itself to solve the mystery. But I invite readers to consider the fact that the mystery of the crop circles is very much like the mystery of the megaliths. Each consists of compelling geometric forms. No one knows why either were made, nor why they are where they are. Nor do we know how either were made. Perhaps the two mysteries are deeply intertwined. Not that either one \"caused\" or \"inspired\" the other, but that the two phenomena somehow \"talk\" about the same thing, a thing still unknown to us, or \"do\" a single thing, taken together as a total system. It could be that solving one mystery will automatically solve the other. The rest of the history of the 1991 season consists not so much of what was flattened, but of what was found in the labs afterward. We (meaning the scientists working in con- junction with myself) have some remarkable findings to report. III.

Here, Morcom and I offer an analysis of the first long oval. Step 1 The \"fins\" were laid down. We infer this because the plants in the oval extended slightly over the plants in the fins. This is somewhat speculative, because the oval's plants could have blown over into the fins after the formation was made. However, Morcom has observed that the phenomenon characteristically starts by forming the minor elements, so we think the fins did go down first. Step 2 The major and minor axes of the oval were sketched out with ribs. Each rib was six to eight inches wide (this is characteristic.) The central minor-axis rib's plants bent into the outline of the oval, suggesting that the phenomenon did the next step immediately after laying the centralminor axis. (Parts of the central minor axis seemed to lie on top of the circle rather than below, suggesting that not all of it went down at the same time.) Step3 The outline of the oval was drawn. We know the outline went down before the interior because the plants in the outline lay underneath the ones in the interior. Step 4 The right and left sides of the oval were flattened in brushlike strokes, working outward from the center. Where the oval narrowed into the spurs, the plants were densely clustered, often plaited together. StepS The central circle and outer rings were constructed. We know the central circle went down at this time, because its plants overlay those in the oval's right and left sides. The rings were clearly made after the spurs were formed, because their plants lay on top of the spurs on one side. Upon completion, the formation was 346 feet long. Does the Phenomenon Work in Discrete Steps? This analysis assumes that the formation was made in discrete steps. However, it is possible that the steps overlapped, so that plants in different areas of the formation went down just in time to make way for other plants being laid down in another direction. Evidence from videotapes, eyewitness reports, and Levengood's plant analyses suggests that crop circles are made with this kind of rapidity. Diagrams adapted from J.F. Languish's survey of the formation. MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 282 October 1991"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"1 lit Figure 1.

I will briefly mention the work of Christopher Church, an American meteorologist working with Terence Meaden, and finish by discussing the work of Brian Grist, an Englishman who is investigating a pos- sible correlation between the crop circles and England's geology. 7/7/4. Marshall Dudley's radiation measurements of soil samples M arshall Dudley is a systems engineer for Tenne- lec/Nucleus of Oak Ridge, Tennessee. His em- ployer manufactures gas flow counters, which are instruments designed to detect extremely minute amounts of alpha and beta radiation. They are much more sensitive than ordinary hand-held Geiger counters. He volunteered to use this equipment to examine soil samples from English crop circles, if I could get him some. I got him sets of samples from five crop circles, and he already had a sixth sample set from a crop circle in Ten- nessee. Each consisted of at least two samples from inside and one control, taken between 30 and 300 feet away. The first set of samples, from a formation at Jaywick (July 16/17, 1991), seemed relatively uninteresting. They varied from the control by 12% or less in all cases. Dudley regards such variations as not likely to be significant, because soil is a fairly heterogeneous substance. The presence of a small rock with traces of an alpha emitter could explain variations in that range, for example. Or the soil itself might be less amenable to radiological alternation than soils in other areas of the country (the formation was about a mile from England's eastern coast). Another possibility is that it was a hoax, though I inspected it with Montague Keen of the CCCS shortly after it was made, and it appeared genuine to us. Quite simply, we do not yet know how the Jaywick formation fits in, relative to the other five formations. The second set of samples is from the controversial Bar- bury Castle formation. The first time Dudley counted them, the differences were not significant. However, Dudley re- counted the samples two weeks later, and got strangely anomalous results. The total emission levels were higher, but expectedly so, since as samples dry out there is less water to block alpha and beta particles. However, one sample, previously 3% lower in alpha count than the control, was now 31% lower. The other sample, previously 10% higher in alpha count, was now 17% higher. These disparities — one sample lower — present a perplexing challenge to anyone trying to decide if the Barbury Castle formation is genuine. The disparities from the control appear to be significant, but they are significant in opposite directions. To put it another way, the anomalies are themselves anomalous. Further analysis may show how they fit into the general pattern, or fail to. Later, when we have more complete data, we may be able to return to this set and settle the issue for good. The third set, from Alton Priors, also yielded low alpha counts. (Dudley had only one sample and one control from that formation, since one of the samples was accidentally rendered unusable.) The sample emitted alpha particles at a rate of 26% below the control; recounted two weeks later, it emitted at 17% below the control. We have seen low alpha counts before, in a set of samples from a doughnut-shaped formation at Dandridge, Tennessee, formed May 17, 1991. There, a sample from the ring registered alpha emissions 27% lower than the control. Dudley has hypothesized that something changes the soil chemically in such a way that it absorbs or retains more water, which ab- sorbs alpha particles. The target samples would dry out more slowly than the controls, so they would yield consistently lower counts. Dr. Levengood has suggested another possible explanation for the low alpha counts. Alpha particles are positive helium ions. Their positive charge is one of the criteria a gas flow counter uses to identify them. (The other is their mass.) But if something adds two electrons to an alpha particle, the par- ticle becomes neutral, and the counter will not detect it. It could be that something added negative ions to the soil, which donated electrons to alpha particles as they were emitted. The counter then would have failed to \"see\" the alpha particles. However, Dudley is chary of this hypothesis. He points out that alpha particles typically move quickly enough to have their electrons knocked off by surrounding air molecules. Even if electrons were added, they should have been removed again. I'm not qualified to adjudicate between these competing hypotheses, of course, but in time I hope the scientific com- munity will do so. If Levengood is correct, then the data could be interpreted as supporting Dr. Terence Meaden's plasma vortex theory. One possible source of negative ions is a plasma vortex, since that is exactly what a plasma is: a dense collection of charged par- ticles. I should point out that even if Levengood is absolutely right about the plasma vortex, it still does not necessarily sup- port Dr. Meaden's contention that the plasma is of natural origin. All it would suggest is that there is a plasma. No fur- ther positive conclusion would be warranted. Whatever the truth is, the important thing is that Levengood and Dudley have generated publicly available observations that can be examined and debated. This, even more than their hypotheses, is a magnificent contribution to cereology. The fourth and fifth samples, from the second and third long ovals, were extraordinarily interesting. There were no low alpha counts here. Instead, there were very high ones, both in the alpha and beta ranges.

Ah 1 of these counts are far outside the ranges of normal soil variation, statistical variation or instrumental error. The fifth set of samples also yielded very high relative counts. Here, there were four samples, two from inside the formation and two controls. The two controls, harvested several hundred feet apart, yielded alpha and beta counts within 2% and 4% of each other, respectively. On the other hand, the samples from within the formation yielded alpha counts 45 % and 27 % above the averaged controls, and beta counts 25% and 22% above. These, too, cannot be attributed to normal variation or error. Dudley hypothesizes that something either adds a minute amount of radioactive material to the soil, or bombards its nuclei with neutrons and/or protons. This latter process is called neutron (or proton) activation. The extra particles lodge in the atomic nuclei and render them unstable and prone to eventual radioactive decay. Initial analysis of spec- trographic data seems to suggest neutron activation, but it will take much more research and analysis to confirm this. Do Dudley's findings imply any health hazard? No — as long as people enter circles several hours after they form, since by then the residual radiation would have dropped so much that only extraordinarily sensitive equipment could detect it. At that point, the crop circle is less radioactive than the basement of an ordinary cinder-block building. However, Dudley advises that people who actually witness a crop circle forming should stay away from the immediate area for several hours as a precaution. It may not be necessary, but until we know more about the radioactive energies involved, we should err on the side of caution. Of course, this warning is moot most of the time, since most circles form at night and are not discovered until morning. It is puzzling that two sets registered abnormally high counts, while two others registered abnormally low ones. Obviously, one possibility is that normal soil is more heterogeneous than we realize. The fact that the controls from the fifth set registered very similar counts mitigates against this, but we need more soil samples from the region to make sure. Another possibility is that it matters when the samples are collected and analyzed. Some samples were col- lected promptly after the formation was made; others were collected after several days' delay. Rain in between might have washed away radioactive elements (or added them!) Another possibility is that it matters where the samples are collected within the formation; some areas of a formation may be more strongly affected than others. Yet another possibility is that different formations are made with dif- ferent \"techniques,\" some affecting the soil chemically, others affecting it radiologically. We don't have the answers yet, but we do have many more ideas for further research. For example, next year I plan to take multiple samples from several formations, to see if radiological or chemical \"con- tour lines\" emerge from an analysis of the data. If nothing else, the results suggest that the hoax theory is seriously inadequate. Radioactive phenomena involve, by Damage on the microscopic level implies that a lot of energy was involved, much more than can be generated by macroscopic techniques such as foot-stomping. These findings con- stitute powerful evidence that the phenomenon is not a hoax, or at least not a common hoax, perpetrated by pranksters with strings and planks. definition, processes energetic enough to split atomic nuclei. Foot-stomping, no matter how vigorous, is not energetic enough by many orders of magnitude. Something far more interesting is at work. 1IIB. Dr. W. C. Levengood's analyses of plant samples Dr. W. C. Levengood is a biophysicist living in Michigan, who specializes in plant and seed development. He holds six patents, among them a seed germination and vigor se- lection device now in commercial production around the world. Among his 49 publications are five papers in the prestigious journal Nature and one in Science. Dr. Lev- engood expressed interest in examining plants from crop circles, so Pat Delgado and I sent him samples throughout the summer of 1991. Dr. Levengood made some remarkable discoveries. One was that the growth nodes on the plants had become significantly larger than those of the controls. Growth nodes are the bulblike swellings one sees on wheat stalks; typically there are three or four. Dr. Levengood measured the ratio of the node width to the stem width, and found that it was significantly larger in the target plants than in the controls (95% probability of significance) (photos 5 and 6). He hypothesizes that some energy input, possibly heat, caused the cells in those nodes to swell, causing lasting but not fetal damage. A layman might try to explain the anomalous swellings as an artifact of the plant's horizontal orientation, though Levengood says that would be a completely inadequate hypothesis. It would be even more difficult to explain another of Dr. Levengood's discoveries that way. When he examined seeds from a formation at Newton St. Loe, he found that about 40% of them were malformed, whereas all of the control seeds were normal. This was also seen at Lockeridge, where 32% of the seeds were abnormal, and at Alton Barnes, where 20% were abnormal. The visible abnormalities were most pro- nounced in formations made early in the season; later in the season, the seeds looked more normal to the eye, probably because they were more mature and less susceptible to in- jury. However, Levengood has been running more sophisticated \"redox\" tests on the mature seeds. The results will be made available when the tests are completed. His third finding was one of the most dramatic and ex- citing. His microscopic examination of the node cells re- MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 282 October 1991"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"vealed that the pits in their walls had become larger and more visible. Cell wall pits are tiny holes in the cells, which control the transport of ions and electrolytes into and out of the organism. In his photos (7 and 8), one can see that the pits have swelled from faint grayish dots to sharply de- fined trapezoid shapes looking a bit like caraway seeds. This is what would happen, Levengood thinks, if something heated the water inside the cells so rapidly that the cell walls swelled and forced the pits to expand. In fact, one of the photos shows \"stretch marks\" radiating from the pits, sug- gesting that the cell walls had been stretched. (His obser- vation can be duplicated easily: all one needs is a microscope, magnification 450x, no stain.) Dr. Levengood tested his hypothesis about the cell wall stretching by putting some of the control wheat stalks in a microwave oven for 30 seconds. Sure enough, their cells swelled just enough to stretch their cell wall pits, exactly as observed in the samples. It is very exciting to theorize that some kind of energy heats the plants very rapidly in the course of flattening them. Of course, we are not yet sure what kind of energy it could be. It could be microwaves, negative ions, radiation, or something else altogether. Fur- ther research may tell.

It was further developed by John Brandenburg in the April 1991 issue of the MUFON UFO Journal.) 3 There was one case where the cell membranes did in fact break. In grass from a formation in Cornwall, the cell walls had completely broken down. Not only that, some of the grass blades had been coated with a black, nonreflective substance which looked like soot. Dr. Levengood found that it was carbon black, a substance which can be obtained by heating waxes or sugars. (Think of how a marshmallow turns black as it burns.) Plant leaves are covered with a wax, name- ly paraffin. If the grass had been heated just enough to char but not catch fire, the paraffin would indeed have been re- duced to carbon black. The presence of the carbon black is irresistibly reminis- cent of the handful of \"burned circles\" which have been reported in the U.S., Canada and England. The 1990 NAICCR report notes that there were 15 burned circles out of a total of 86 North American \"unusual ground markings\" in 1990. 4 In his introduction to the report, Chris Rutkowski asked, but could not answer, the question of whether burned circles are related to English-type crop circles. Now we can hypothesize that they are. Too much energy, relative to the plants' \"tolerances,\" burns them; too little leaves them on- ly partially flattened; just the right amount produces a stan- dard English-type formation. It is very interesting that every single one of the 15 North American burned circles was in grass, as was the Cornwall formation. Grass may be particularly vulnerable because of the thinness of its leaves. One can thus speculate that its \"safe\" region between partial flattening and burning is nar- rower than wheat's. It gets even more interesting when we discover that the Photos 5 (above) and 6 (below). These are sections from wheat plants harvested from a three-circle dumbbell at Lockeridge near Beck- ham pton formed June 21, 1991. Note that the growth nodes on the target plants are larger than on the control plants. Photo by W. C. Levengood. Cornwall formation was not a simple burned circle. It was a \"Y\" shape inscribed inside a ring, and the burns were located at the junctions between the \"Y\" and the ring. It could be that junctions are critical sites where the formative force must work particularly hard or linger particularly long. Normally we don't see any burning in complex formations, but this one was in grass, an especially sensitive material. We can hypothesize that the phenomenon did not get the adjustment quite right for the grass, and burned the shape's junctions. In a strange way, cereology is becoming like genetics: we can learn the most from the phenomenon's \"mistakes.\" Whenever it gets it \"wrong,\" we have a special opportunity to learn how it does it at all. It seems that whatever flattens the plants usually delivers the right amount of energy to flat- ten them without bursting the cells or charring the paraf- fin.

On top of that, even the same crop can differ from field to field, depending on the richness of the soil and the amount of growth regulator used. Since there are relatively few \"mistakes,\" it could be argued that the phenomenon is somehow \"tuned\" to the specific characteristics of each field. This implicitly posits an intelligent agency, of course, but I would argue that it is not an unreasonable speculation. Dr. Levengood disagrees, preferring to posit a natural phenomenon. However, we both feel that publication of facts must precede theorizing about ultimate causes. It is of the highest importance that none of these effects — the node swelling, the seed abnormalities, the cell wall stretching — were visible in plants harvested from hoaxed formations. We have already effectively performed a blind test. This summer, one of Levengood's plant sets revealed no particular discrepancies between the target plants and the controls — and the formation was later found to be a hoax. We hope to conduct controlled blind tests in the summer of 1992, to refine the effectiveness of our litmus tests. T he work of Marshall and Levengood points to a cause which pumps energy into the plants, leaving them intact but causing damage within. This kind of damage is almost impossible to cause by trampling. It's like the difference between breaking a radio by dropping it on the floor and irradiating it in a reactor. When a radio is dropped, its transistors and resistors stay intact though the whole item is damaged, whereas under irradiation, the pieces fry even though the whole may appear unharmed. The lat- ter kind of damage, though more subtle, uses much more energy. It takes very little energy to drop a radio, but a lot to irradiate it. So it is with plants. Trampling a plant damages the overall organism but leaves most of its cells intact, whereas baking or irradiating a plant stretches or ruptures the cell walls while leaving the organism in one piece. For example, an ear of corn doesn't fall apart when it's cooked, but most of its cells do. Damage on the microscopic level implies that a lot of energy was involved, much more than can be generated by macroscopic techniques such as foot-stomping. These findings constitute powerful evidence that the phenomenon is not a hoax, or at least not a common hoax, perpetrated by pranksters with strings and planks. They do not, how- ever, tell us what is making the formations — at least not yet. IIIC. Sheldon Wernikoff's reproductions of quintuplet-forms in a plasma chamber Sheldon Wernikoff of Skokie, Illinois, has explored Meaden's plasma vortex theory by trying to make laboratory-generated plasma vortices duplicate the quintuplet shapes often seen in the English fields prior to 1990 (photo 9). He used a spherical glass chamber similar in principle to the electrical \"sparkballs\" often sold in novelty shops. A Tesla coil Photo 9. A quintuplet-shaped laboratory plasma vortex. Photo by Richard Shapiro. generated high-voltage, low-frequency current which excited the inert-gas mixture inside the sphere, causing miniature plasma vortices to form. (These are similar to the bright wavy lines one sees dancing inside sparkballs.) Given the right conditions, a set of five small circles form where each vortex contacts the spherical anode inside the chamber. Wernikoff suggests that his work may help confirm Meaden's plasma vortex theory. With due respect to Wer- nikoff, I would respond that his important and innovative work still does not bring us any closer to resolving ques- tions of \"who\" or \"what.\" One can as easily argue that some intelligence generates and manipulates vortices (as Wernikoff himself did) to create complex shapes as that a natural force spontaneously generates them. Laboratory-generated vor- tices are, of course, anything but natural phenomena! Meaden's own team failed to detect a single plasma vortex during weeks of surveillance in a very active area. I will remain skeptical of an entirely naturalistic answer until someone offers a cogent account of how a plasma, vortex actually forms the ribs and intricate layering effects seen in the most complex formations, explains why the shapes grow more complex each year, and accounts for the recent historical provenance of the phenomenon. However, for all that, I think Wernikoff s work is very important and worthy of attention and support. MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 282 October 1991"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"HID. Christopher Church and the meteorological lay of the land According to a recent article in Science, 5 Christopher Church, a professor of aeronautics at Miami University in Ohio, has built a scale model of the Hampshire hills to test Meaden's theory that lee turbulence from the hills creates the crop circles. Science reports that his tentative conclu- sion is that horizontal flow alone is not sufficent; vertical airflow, such as thermals, would also be required. Yet, ac- cording to Meaden, crop circles appear most often in calm air (though Meaden has not published data to back up this generalization.) Other possibilities, such as that high-altitude winds drive the hypothesized plasma vortex, have not yet been tested. HIE. Brian Grist's geological hypothesis Brian Grist, a bookstore manager in Bristol, England, and a former geography student, is working on a study to cor- relate the locations of the circles with the underlying geological substrates. Grist's preliminary work has raised the exciting possibility that the circles may correlate positive- ly with water-saturated rocks (aquifers) like chalk and limestone. If the phenomenon has an electrical component, which seems possible, ground water might play a critical role in attracting it. Grist hopes to publish his study later this year, possibly mThe Circular. FV. Surveillance Monitoring and Cropwatches N aturally, we all want to catch the phenomenon in the act, preferably while we are holding cameras and tape recorders. Each year since 1989, we have had some success. This year was no exception. In this sec- tion I will discuss the findings of three separate surveillance teams. John MacNish and David Morgenstern of the BBC con- ducted a 24-hour surveillance watch with cameras and sen- sitive microphones from Morgan's Hill. They camped close to Terence Meaden's Operation Blue Hill, which used a caravan-mounted radar and meteorological instruments. Ap- parently, neither team detected anything remarkable on the night of June 27, 1991, when a dumbbell and two circles formed in the plain below the hill. George Wingfield describes the event in his bulletin, which is worth quoting at length: The BBC team led by John MacNish and David Morgenstern had set up a surveillance operation on Morgan's Hill using banks of expensive camera and infra-red equipment to keep a 24-hour watch on a field below the hill where a magnificent quadruple-ringed Circle and a Celtic Cross appeared respectively on June 1 and July 5, 1990 ... In addition to the video equip- ment they have a powerful directional microphone which digitally records all sound in the range 2 to 40000 Hz, i.e. infra-sound, audible sound and some ultra- sound. The night of June 27/28 [1991] was cloudy and rainy and looked most unpromising. At about 3 a.m. some mist was in evidence and this appeared to be thickest right over the field being observed ... At 5:45 a.m., an hour after dawn, the mist began to slowly clear. The pall of mist over the field under observa- tion was the last to disperse and, when it did, the cameramen could just see markings in the crop. They rushed down the hill to seal off entry to the field in which they could now see with binoculars a large dumb- bell pictogram. Close inspection showed no signs of human entry or footprints in the wet soil at entry points to the field. A playback of the tapes from the direc- tional microphone was found to be completely blank at all recorded frequencies ... Dr. Meaden and his 19 Japanese scientists are also encamped on Morgans Hill and were thought to have that field under observation as well ... he has on Morgan's Hill a radar device and the other night [not the night of June 27] this tracked an object which moved slowly and also at great speed. It was definite- ly not an aircraft and according to him must have been the elusive plasma vortex they are seeking. He and the Japanese scientist rushed to look for this object but nothing was seen in the sky. 6 As the June 27th experience shows, the phenomenon is elusive. It was also elusive on the night of July 16/17, when a single-dumbbell formed about 200 yards from a fish-and- chips shop and a row of houses in the town of Jay wick, on England's eastern coast. When Montague Keen and I in- vestigated the formation on the evening of the 17th, we talked to six of the families living in the houses, and none had seen or heard anything unusual the night before. Apart from the BBC watch and Operation Blue Hill, the CCCS (Centre for Crop Circle Studies) coordinated a crop- watch through most of the summer. On June 22, 1991, three CCCS cropwatchers observed a glowing orange ball, which they were lucky enough to videotape for a few seconds with the moon in one corner. One of the cropwatchers, John Holman, notes in his CCCS report that the film shows the globe remaining stationary just above the ridge of Milk Hill (at map coordinate SU 104 642) . 7 To my knowledge, no crop circle has appeared in that precise location, nor on that night, though 1990's second double-dumbbell and 1991's \"frying pan\" were within a kilometer of the spot. The object vanished several seconds later. A close examination of the film shows that it vanished in just two frames, which amounts to between l/17th and l/25th of a second. In the report, Hojman attempts to estimate its size. He knows they were on the Ridgeway (at SU 120 691), and they believ- ed the object was on top of Milk Hill, five kilometers away. Based on these locations, Holman comes up with a size of 25-35 meters in diameter. A fascinating aspect of Holman's report is his discovery that a hill three kilometers down the ridge (at SU 128 640) is named \"Golden Ball Hill\"!

Later that night, Holman and his friends saw an object in the sky which they would have thought an aircraft but for its complete silence. He writes that they saw \"a single flashing white light on its underside (much like any aircraft) but a single large rectangular blue green light/glow above this. We could not see any wings or other lights or other features that could identify it\" (p. 2). It flew very slowly past them eastward, turned south, then flew back in their direction, then once again headed south. They filmed it, but the camera was on autofocus and the film shows lit- tle. Writes Holman, \"I have a life long knowledge and interest in aircraft and could not identify this aircraft, but I do not wish to make any claims as to what it was, I simply don't know (p. 2). We should follow Holman's lead in sticking to basic descriptions. Best not to theorize yet, but to keep watching the hand. We can learn so much if we will open our eyes. V. Conclusion Figure 2.

The surrounding area is tradi- tionally filled with crop circles. skies, cameras in — and the conviction that nothing can keep the truth from simply consent to human beings who have the energy to work, and the pas- sionate, unquenchable will to know. We believe that the results of current research, ours and others', are very striking. To summarize them: • The phenomenon induces radiation anomalies. • It appears to heat the plants both rapidly and briefly. • It can sometimes scorch the plants, particularly in grass. • It swells plant cell walls, elongating the cell wall pits and leaving \"stretch marks.\" • It often induces developmental anomalies in the seeds. • The circles may correlate with aquifers. • The circles do correlate, at least grossly, with ancient megaliths. • The quintuplet may be artificially duplicable. • We may be able to distinguish hoaxes from genuine circles with laboratory tests. • Some formations may represent or symbolize known objects. • The circles do correlate geographically with some well- documented (i.e. filmed) sightings of unidentified luminous aerial objects. Cereology yields that golden thing, substantive results. Perhaps we will see a \"cascade effect\" as scientists and in- tellectuals gain confidence and venture into the field in in- creasing numbers. There is plenty of room for them, since so much remains to be done.

Rubtsov, Ph.D. Rubtsov is a MUFON Consultant in Philosophy and our Representative for Western U.S.S.R. On January 7, 1990, about 8:40 a.m., Mr. A. E. Voront- sov, a resident of the little town of Merefa, about 30 kilometers SSW of Kharkov, went by bicycle to the bank of the river Mzha to inspect his baited fishing tackle. When he was not far from the bank, he noticed a strange luminescence over the river. As the witness came nearer, he saw a \"saucer,\" or rather a big top-shaped object with the diameter of its base approximately 25 meters, and the height, including its spire, about 5-6 meters. The object was situated on the ice or slightly above it in a small bay. The spire and the base of the object were greyish-blue, and its body - orange or rose colored. The witness said it was \"something like the color of the clouds in the sky at sunset.\" The base was pulsating \"as if some balls were rolling around there.\" The witness observed the object in astonishment for, as he believes, about 10 minutes. Then the UFO suddenly took off vertically, to an altitude of some 30 meters, hovered for several seconds and then flew eastward. A big round piece of ice on the landing site sank into the water, then it rose again back to the surface. Thanks to a lucky chance, a member of the Kharkov regional UFO study group, Dr. Pyotr I. Kutnyuk, was ad- vised about this case only one day later. He promptly took photos of the landing site, when the trace was clearly visi- ble (photos 1-4, taken on January 8) and informed the group about the event. I was able to visit the site on January 13, when the ring was less distinct, but still quite visible (photos 5-8). A few days later the members of the group took samples of the ice from the site. A month ago we obtained, at last, the results of its chemical analysis. No peculiarities were found, except that in one sample there proved to be a slightly increased concentration of platinum (2.5 x 10~ 7 grammes per liter, versus some 0.5 x 10 7 in other samples). The diameter of the circle was 20.7 meters and the ring was one meter wide. It is worthy to note that on January 7 the ice was still rather thin due to a comparatively warm winter, and it was not until January 13 that it became thick enough to safely bear the weight of a man walking on ice. Thus, the traces could hardly have been hoaxed. The depth of water under the circle is about eight meters. The ring or rather the rings, as one will note on photos 2 and 3, were very regular and clearly outlined, as if made by a giant milling machine cutter. Three weeks after the date of the event the rings were still visible, but when the ice melted this very interesting trace obviously vanished.

A n entity sighting investigation was conducted on August 7, 1991 in a mid-Missouri town following a tip from Bob Gribble, MUFON Western Regional Director. The reported sighting took place at a private residence located in a quiet neighborhood less than one mile from the town center. The investigation centered on three young girls aged 12, 11 and 10 (Witnesses 1, 2 and 3, respec- tively) who had two encounters with an entity during the early morning hours of July 21, 1991. All three girls are con- sidered reliable witnesses; they have no history of fabrication and evinced con- siderable consternation and fright con- cerning the encounter. The girls were not interviewed separately due to the time lapse between the encounter and the investigation, and because they are together on an almost daily basis and have discussed the encounter extensive- ly. However, each drew pictures of the entity independently and the similari- ty between the drawings themselves, and those from other documented cases, is obvious. The investigation summary follows in chronological order. At approximately 2:00 a.m. on July 21, 1991 the three girls were watching television in the den of Witness #2's home. The three adults who were in the house, Witness #2's parents and her 18-year-old cousin, had retired for the night sometime earlier. The program the girls were watching concluded at 2:00 a.m. and they went into the backyard to jump on Witness #2's trampoline. They had been outside only a short time when they saw a white, oval- shaped light move rapidly from the side of the house into the corner of the backyard near the tree where the en- tity was first sighted. At the time they believed the light to be car headlights and took no particular notice of it. Be- tween one and five minutes after see- ing the light, they heard rustling noises in the corner of the yard where the light had \"descended.\" The next door neighbor's dog also began barking ex- citedly as the rustling began. At this point Witness #1 looked toward the corner of the yard and saw the entity standing in front of the tree. Witness #1 described the entity as small, white, very skinny with long skinny fingers, with a bald egg-shaped head that was ridged on top so that the head sloped upward to the ridge and then continued to slope upward with a more pronounced egg shape, and with large dark eyes. She also described the entity as transparent in its abdominal area because she could see what was behind it through it. She was frightened and speechless as well as unbelieving of what she was seeing. Witness #1 continued to stare at the entity and Witness #2, who had not yet seen the entity, asked her what she was looking at. Witness #1 pointed to the entity and Witness #2 turned and saw the entity just as it was beginning to move toward the girls. At this point the entity was approximately 33 feet from the witnesses. The entity was described as moving very slowly as it advanced toward the girls. At approximately nine feet from the tree, and approximately 24 feet from the witnesses, the entity moved a low-hanging dead tree branch out of its way with its right hand. This branch measured 53 inches from the ground and showed no unusual attributes. As the entity advanced it hunched its shoulders up in a slow shrugging fashion and opened its mouth widely, which was described to this point as a line with possibly very narrow lips. It continued to advance with this aspect. Witness #1 turned and began to run toward the house, which was approx- imately 20 feet from the trampoline, followed closely by Witness #2, who jumped down from the trampoline. Witness #3, who had not yet seen the entity, was left behind. She yelled after Witness #1 and Witness #2 and they replied something to the effect of \"Behind you!\" and \"Come on!\" At this point Witness #3 turned around and saw the entity standing right next to the trampoline with its shoulders still hunched and its mouth still open. She turned and ran, nearly falling as she got off the trampoline. Once inside the girls closed and locked the door. Witness #1 looked at a clock and remembers the time as 3:00 a.m. (It is interesting to note that the drawings done by the girls reflect the distance and perspective at which each first saw the entity.) Missing Time? The observation of the time by Witness #1 raises the possibility of some \"missing time\" unrecalled by the witnesses. The girls went outside at 2:00 a.m. and saw the light just as they had gotten onto the trampoline, which they did immediately upon going out. The girls state that they saw the entity about one to five minutes after seeing the light, and also state that they were outside only five to ten minutes. However, it appears that approximate- ly one hour elapsed between the time they went outside and the time they returned to the house after seeing the entity. All three girls are bright,,ar- ticulate and above average in maturity for their age, and it seems unlikely that they would misjudge the time they spent outside by at least 50 minutes. Once inside the girls went to the basement and awakened Witness #2's cousin and told him that they had seen a ghost. The cousin, obviously not find- ing their story credible, replied that MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 282 October 1991"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"they should leave the ghost alone and went back to sleep. The girls were scared and confused and decided that they would not awaken Witness #2's parents due to the lateness of the hour. However, they did not want to go to bed out of fear. Instead they returned to the den and began to watch more television. Shortly after they returned to the den they heard Witness #2's cat meowing strangely and scratching at the door. The girls were hesitant to open the door to let the cat in, but eventually did on- ly to have the cat run from them. This was atypical behavior for the cat and only after considerable coaxing did the cat finally enter the house. The girls then resumed watching television. A fter some undetermined amount of time the television went blank with only white static appearing on the screen. At this point the entity was seen by all three girls as it looked through the window at each of them in turn: Witness #3, Witness #1 and Witness #2 respective- ly. The witnesses stated that the entity moved its head in a jerking, mechanical manner, not with the smooth motion one would expect from a human observer. The girls ran to the basement where they stayed for the remainder of the night, periodically coming up the stairs leading from the basement to the den to see if the entity was still there, which it was each time they looked. The girls did not know how long this went on, or how many trips they made up the stairs. Curiously, when Witness #2's parents rose for the day and the girls went upstairs to relate their experience, the television was turned off. The girls maintain they did not turn the televi- sion off and Witness #2's parents state that the television was not on when they entered the den for the first time that morning. This discrepancy concerning the television may also indicate some events unrecalled by the witnesses. Witness #1, in relating the events concerning the sighting of the entity at the window, stated that after the television went blank, \"we did something but I forgot what.\" This statement struck the in- The witness stated that the entity moved its head in a jerking, mechanical manner, not with the smooth motion one would ex- pect from a human observer. vestigators as an odd usage of the past tense, especially since it is not in- dicative of her normal (as observed by the investigators) use of language. In \"normal\" (and we use the word ad- visedly) context, one usually would say \"I forget what we did.\" The signifi- cance of the statement is, of course, speculative, but we think it noteworthy nonetheless. Who turned off the televi- sion, or possibly, how it was turned off remains unknown. A drawing of the entity looking in the window was done by Witness #2. The window itself measures 54 and 1/2 in- ches from the ground to the bottom of the glass pane. Beneath the window and against the house is (and was) a broken bale of straw that measures 19 inches high and is stable enough to stand upon. The entity apparently was standing upon this bale of straw while it was looking in the window. This would ac- count for the perspective of Witness #2's drawing and the difference in height required to substantiate the perspective. (Given the height of the tree branch moved by the entity, the height of the window, and the height of the bale of straw, the entity's height is believed to be about 4 and 1/2 feet.) An Addendum On the morning on July 23, 1991, Bob Gribble telephoned this case lead to Walt Andrus for assignment and in- vestigation. The mother of Witness #2 had obtained the telephone number of the National UFO Reporting Center from the local police department. Since MUFON did not have an investigator in the city involved, and given the potential significance of a multiple witness entity case, Walt Andrus in- itiated a preliminary investigation by calling the mother and conducting a telephone interview with Witness #2, aged 11 and 1/2 years. She described the entity in her backyard in the following manner: short in height, skinny, forehead protruded, had a dent on the top of its head and the back of its head also protruded.

She couldn't see the eyelids at first, but later noticed that they came out of the eye socket from the top. The witness could not discern a nose and there was no indentation on the upper lip between the nose and mouth like a human. The mouth was not open in- itially, but when it opened it looked black. The entity was entirely white with no apparent clothing. It had long slim fingers, but she didn't know how many. She didn't look at the entity's feet, therefore couldn't provide a description. (Only the head and neck appeared through the window of the home in the second sighting.) When questioned about the height of the entity in the backyard, in comparison to herself at five feet, two inches, she said it was shorter. The three girls on the tram- poline watched the entity as it started moving toward them. Witness #2 said the entity walked like it was tiptoeing very slowly although she couldn't pro- vide any description about the feet. She couldn't remember any details con- cerning the arms but was very cogni- zant of the long fingers on the hands. The father of Witness #2 promptly mailed Walt Andrus a drawing of the entity made by his daughter. This ad- dendum is a preliminary interview with Witness #2 only. When Susan Bedell was conducting the audio taped inter- view in Duane's presence with the three girls, sometimes a second would momentarily interrupt, or two would talk simultaneously when they tried to clarify particular observations. Duane and Susan Bedell, former members of Bob Gribble's Washington State team, now live in Springfield, Missouri. After calling Walt Andrus, Bob thought of the Bedells in Missouri and called them immediately thereafter. With the advance notice, they were able to respond before the assigned in- vestigator in the vicinity was geared to mount an investigation even though they had to travel a greater distance. Bruce Widaman, State Director for Missouri, withdrew the assignment when he was advised by John Carpenter that Duane Sketch of entity by witness number two. Other drawings were similar. and Susan had conducted a personal in- terview and investigation. MUFON is indebted to these fine investigators for their prompt and complete investiga- tion. John Carpenter will be called upon if hypnotherapy is deemed ad- visable to recover possible missing time experiences by the three girls.

He happened to glance up at the sky — why, he didn't know — and out of the corner,of his eye he caught a flash of light on the southeastern horizon. He stopped and looked at the sky where the flash of light had been, but couldn't see anything. He was just about to walk on when he noticed what he described as \"a pinpoint\" of light in the same spot where he'd seen the flash. In a second or two the \"pinpoint\" grew larger and it was obvious to the CAA man that something was approaching the airport at a terrific speed. As he watched, the object grew larger and larger until it flashed directly overhead and disap- peared to the northwest. The UFO had been in sight for about 15 seconds and during this time it had passed from horizon to horizon. It was shaped like a \"flattened tennis ball,\" bright silver in color, and when it was directly overhead it was \"the size of a 50-cent piece held at arm's length.\" Two minutes later, at 1:45 p.m., a pilot, Charles Warren, radioed Hulman Aiport that he had seen a UFO. He was flying from Greencastle, Indiana to Paris, Illinois, when just east of Paris he had looked back and to his left, for no apparent reason. There, level with his airplane and fairly close, was a large silver object, \"like a flattened orange,\" hanging motionless in the sky. He look- ed at it a few seconds, then maneuvered his plane around in a tight left bank. He headed directly toward the UFO, but it suddenly began to move and pick up speed and streaked off toward the north- east. (The Report on Unidentified Fly- ing Objects by Edward Ruppelt; The Hynek UFO Report by J. Allen Hynek) • On the same afternoon of the Indiana-Illinois sightings, Clarence L. George was sunning himself in the backyard of his Lodi, Ohio home when he spotted a barrel-like object, silver and glittering and \"going like hell\" across the sky. \"The object was about half the size of a large airplane,\" George said. \"I was following it, trying to locate wings on it, when all of a sud- den it made a right angle turn without decreasing speed. In about two or three seconds it was out of sight. It was shiny and glistening. I heard a peculiar sound and looked up. Then I saw this object traveling at a high rate of speed, faster than anything I have seen in the air in daytime. It was near the speed of a fall- ing meteor.\" (The Beacon Journal, Akron, OH, 10/11/51) 1956 • Three pilots of a four-plane group in Marine Air Reserve Squadron 241, stationed at the Naval Air Station, Los Alamitos, California, sighted a silver, disc-shaped object on the mor- ning of the 13th. Flying at 24,000 feet over West Orange County, the flight of F9F-6 Gruman Panther jets was in a straight line column. \"I saw a shiny, definitely circular object pass above and going in the opposite direction,\" reported Lt. Lawrence Ball. Major Herman Bushong and Major Lloyd Chamblin also saw the UFO. Major Bushong said: \"It definitely had no ap- pendanges, was circular, like a disc, and gave off a reflection.\" Major Chamblin stated that the object was \"silver and definitely circular. It had no appendages of any kind.\" (The Daily News, Garden Grove, CA, 10/15/56) • On the 28th, various missile-crew personnel at Minot, North Dakota, Air Force Base, as well as the crew of a B-52 bomber, reported observing the erratic flight of one or more UFOs by means of ground-visual, air-visual, and air-radar tracking. In addition, the B-52 bomber that tracked the object took scope photos of the target. The total length of observation of the UFO by ground and airborne observers (combined) was four hours and forty- eight minutes. Some of the more per- tinent details of the sighting are con- tained in the following excerpts from a Project Blue Book Memorandum for the Record, prepared by a Blue Book staff officer: \"At about 3:00 a.m., a B-52 that was about 30 miles northwest of Minot AFB and making practice penetrations sighted an unidentified blip on their radars. Initially the target traveled ap- proximately two-and-one-half miles in three seconds, or at about 3000 MPH. After passing from the right to the left of the plane it assumed a position off the left wing of the B-52. The blip stayed off the left wing for approximate- ly 20 miles atwhich point it broke off. Scope photographs were taken. When the target was close to the B-52 neither of the two transmitters in the bomber would operate properly, but when the UFO broke off both returned to nor- mal function. \"About this time a missile main- tenance man called in and reported sighting a bright orange-red object. The object was hovering at about 1000 feet or so, and had a sound similar to a jet engine. The observer had stopped his car, but he then started it up again. As he started to move, the object followed him, then accelerated and appeared to stop about six to eight miles away. The observer shortly afterward lost sight of it. In response to the maintenance man's call, the B-52, which had continued its penetration run, was vectored toward the visual which was about 10 miles northwest of the base. The B-52 con- firmed having sighted a bright light of some'type that appeared to be hover- ing just over, or, sitting on the ground.\" MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 282 October 1991"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"The Blue Book files contain the reports by 14 members of missile maintenance crews from five different sites at Minot AFB who claimed to have seen a similar object.

Allen Hynek) 1961 I What began as a routine takeoff for Waldo J. Harris, a Salt Lake City, Utah pilot, turned out to be one of the most exciting and perplexing events of his life. At noon on the second Harris was preparing for takeoff from the Utah Central Airport when he sighted a large, gray-colored, disc- shaped object to the south. He was sur- prised to find the craft still in the same position when he became airborne. Curious, he changed his heading and flew toward the large disc, hovering with a rocking motion at an altitude between 6500 and 7000 feet. Harris radioed the airport that he had sighted a UFO and was going to get a better view. Seven witnesses on the ground also observed the disc. Harris headed for the object and got a good view of the craft's top portion at an estimated distance of three miles. It had the appearance of \"sand- blasted\" aluminum. It appeared to be about 50 feet in diameter and five to 10 feet thick at the center. It had the ap- pearance of two shallow dishes joined together at the rim. \"I am sure it was a controlled craft from the performance during my observation,\" Harris said. (The News & Telegram, Salt Lake City, UT, 10/3/61; The Tribune, Salt Lake Ci- ty, UT, 10/3/61) • On the 18th, a man and his wife spotted a strange object over Coble mountain about 10 miles southeast of Fall River Mills, California. It was about 7:00 p.m. when they first saw the hovering, oval-shaped object against the horizon. During their three-hour obser- vation the large oval-shaped object launched two smaller oval-shaped craft. The first small object was launched from the large \"ship\" about an hour after the big ship was first seen. It went towards the Fall River Valley and re- turned about an hour later. As it docked aboard the large oval-shaped ship, a second small craft was launched from the opposite side. This object headed towards Hat Creek and also returned in an hour and docked aboard the large carrier. Immediately the large ship headed towards Redding at a terrific speed. (The News, Fall River Valley, CA, 10/26/61) 1966 • Visible, tangible evidence from UFOs floated down over sections of Jonesboro, Tennessee, about five miles southwest of Johnson City, as many residents witnessed streaks of silk- like substance jettisoned from objects hovering over their homes. The UFOs were sighted in broad daylight on the afternoon of the 12th by people who said they could see \"silvery-white discs\" maneuvering over the area. Several of the residents said there were at least 50 of the craft with domes on top. They would hover and discharge the substance in sheets which threaded into strands before descending to the ground and winding around trees and utility poles. Those who tried to catch the slowly fall- ing substance were burned; one woman had blisters on her face. Others claimed itching sensations. Mrs. Burnette Fox said: \"I caught some of the substance ... in my hand ... and it burned my little finger. I tried to get it off quick, but it was sticky and stuck to everything. We all got a little nauseated and we all itched. Everyone itched that came in the yard until it rained. I got real sick that night and the next morning.\" Mrs. Melba Jones said the utility pole in front of her house was littered with odd material. She \"rolled a large amount of the sticky substance on a stick\" and saved it. Later, Charles Armstrong, a reporter for the Johnson City Chronicle, stopped by the Jones home and asked for some of the substance. \"Even though the night was very cold,\" Mrs. Fox reported, \"the stick was so hot to touch that he was forced to drop it when he picked it up. Mrs. Fox also stated her dog wouldn't leave the house and her cows refused to enter the field where the substance fell until it rained. Other farmers, she said, had similar experiences. \"Everybody that was there saw the objects,\" Mrs. Fox said. \"One came down low and followed the transmis- sion line that runs behind the house. It was so low that it went behind the trees in the distance and was still visible behind them.\" At least one Johnson Ci- ty woman and two Johnson City busi- nessmen saw the UFOs. The silvery substance was felling in the fields where the farmers were working in hay \"and they couldn't have helped but see the stuff falling.\" After dusk that night, two East Tennessee State University pro- fessors, viewing through a telescope, reported seeing more than one object. Professor Larry Miller and D.G. Nicholson reported a \"doughnut- shaped\" craft with a hole in its center and a small, but easily noticeable, slit in the ring of the body. Miller said the light of the object reminded him of a weak fluorescent tube.

The shining disc-shaped craft hovered motionless for five minutes in broad daylight. Newspapers reported that about 50 peo- ple saw it. Kenichi Waga, who is a tele- communications officer at Akita Air- port's control tower, was one of the first people to spot the disc at 10:40 a.m. \"It was south of the airport, about five miles away from it. I watched it for about five minutes,\" Waga said. \"It was disc-shaped, larger than a car, but smaller than an airplane. It was very bright, golden in color, with white lights. I immediately warned all pilots in the area to watch out for the UFO.\" About the same time, Capt.

FUND DRIVE Dear Fund Supporter: I invite you to join me in a fitting tribute to one of the giants of the field of UFOlogy: Donald E. Keyhoe. I was pleased to work with Don Keyhoe when he was director of the Na- tional Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena — the largest civilian UFO organization during the 1960s. He was one of the first promi- nent individuals to call public attention to the significance of the UFO phenomenon. Mr. Keyhoe was a retired Marine Corps Major who served as an aide to Charles A. Lindbergh in 1927 when the famous aviator made the first solo, non- stop flight from New York to Paris. During the 1930s, Keyhoe was a free- lance writer whose work appeared in such publications as The Nation, The Saturday Evening Post and Readers Digest. He passed away on November 29, 1988, at the age of 91. Last year, the Fund for UFO Re- search decided to institute a journalism award in Major Keyhoe's memory, in order to encourage quality investiga- tive reporting into the UFO pheno- menon. During the first year, we pro- vided a $1,000 cash award to George Knapp of KLAS-TV, Las Vegas, for his documentary, \"UFOs: The Best Evi- dence.\" This year, the recipients of the second Donald E. Keyhoe Journalism Award were: • Sharon Santus, staff reporter for the Greensburg (PA) Tribune-Review (for her article on the 25th anniversary of the Kecksburg UFO crash case), win- ner in the Print Category; and • George Knapp of KLAS-TV (for his follow-up series, \"UFOs: The Best Evidence?\") in the Broadcast Category. Ms. Santus and Mr. Knapp each received a $1,000 cash award for their winning entries. The Donald E. Keyhoe Journalism Award is open to any journalist working for a newspaper, magazine, radio or television station whose story on UFOs makes the most significant contribution to public understanding of the phenomenon, without regard to any particular hypothesis. We consider it vitally important to reward good investigative reporting if we are to solve the UFO mystery in our lifetime. I'm sure you agree that we need to encourage journalists to take this subject seriously. That's why I'm asking for your help. The Fund for UFO Research would like to be able to offer cash awards in similar amounts to print and broadcast reporters this year; however, our resources are already committed to other important projects, like the Roswell UFO crash investigation, ab- duction research, and investigation of high-quality UFO sightings. Therefore, I am asking you to make a special contribution — whatever you can — to support our journalism award project. I'm sure Donald Keyhoe would be proud. Sincerely, - Richard Hall National Board Member P.S.

BARKER COLLECTION The Gray Barker UFO Collection of flying saucer books, magazines, newsletters, newspaper clippings and correspondence opened September 14 at the Clarksburg-Harrison Public Library in Clarksburg, WV, accord- ing to Ruth Yeager, collection librarian. Those wishing to see the limited ac- cess collection, which also contains now rare UFO accounts from the 1940s and 50s, can register by calling Yeager at (304) 624-6512. The items pertaining to unidentified flying objects (UFOs) represent the holdings of controversial West Virginia author, publisher and UFO buff Gray Barker. Barker died in 1984, leaving some 300 books, 75 groups of magazines and journals, and 30 filing drawers of correspondence on flying saucers and related paranormal topics. Self-deprecating humor and a fore- bearance for the ridiculous is evident throughout the collection, the librarian notes. One cabinet displays an old bumper sticker that says \"Flying Saucers Are Real — The Air Force Doesn't Exist!\" Barker's interest in saucers began when he investigated the 1952 Flat- woods Monster UFO sighting in Brax- ton Co., WV, and wrote a report for FATE magazine. In the 1970s he gain- ed a wider audience with his full-book account of the collapse of the Silver Bridge at Point Pleasant, WV, and the \"Mothman\" sightings that preceded the disaster. For 30 years, says Yeager, Barker edited six UFO newsletters, delivered countless lectures, published numerous works by other authors, and penned five books of his own, including They Knew Too Much About Flying Saucers, The Book of Adamski, The Silver Bridge, Gray Barker's Book of Saucers and Men in Black: The Secret Terror Among Us. Some of his newsletter titles were \"The Saucerian,\" \"Flying Saucer Magazine\" and \"Saucer News,\" which he took over from fellow UFO en- thusiast Jim Moseley.

The book is priced at $15.95, plus $3.00 ship- ping for UPS delivery. One of the most difficult aspects of UFO research is simply trying to keep up with the many various UFO organizations and publications around the world. Due to the constant coming and going of both groups and periodicals, any listing of this sort is usually out of date by the time it sees print. However, one of the most recent sourcebooks of this kind is the ALMANAC OF UFO ORGANIZA- TIONS & PUBLICATIONS, compiled by David Blevins. It is a comprehen- sive listing of over 200 groups and publications which are actively in- volved in studying the UFO subject and discussing/disseminating their finds. All organizations are listed alpha- betically and again by country. In his introduction, Blevins stresses that he has no editorial axes to grind, but is simply presenting basic information for those who wish to learn more about the subject. It is planned to update the ALMANAC periodically, as war- ranted. In this regard, Blevins asks for readers' contributions of data for future editions. This neatly-done, spiral- bound softcover book is available from Blevins (331 Firecrest Avenue #2 - Pacifica, CA 94044) for $19.45, in- cluding shipping/handling charges. The ALMANAC is especially useful for those who are just becoming interested in the UFO subject, although \"old- timers\" will also find it very helpful.

News'n'Views, continued Barker's files contain letters from people well known on the UFO circuit, including John Keel, Major Donald Keyhoe, Jim Moseley, Carlos Allende, Ivan T. Sanderson, Morris Jessup and Milton Cooper. Several files are devoted to documents obtained piece by piece through the Freedom of In- formation Act. Famous \"contactees\" like George Adamski and Howard Menger are represented, as are obscure religious cults, fringe-interest advocates and numerous UFO groups. Three of the better known organizations found in the files are the Mutual UFO Network (MUFON), the Center for UFO Studies (CUFOS) and NICAP, the Na- tional Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena. There are Barker files on the Navy's alleged 1943 \"Philadelphia Experi- ment' ' in ship invisibility using Eins- tein's unified field theory; \"MJ-12\" (allegations of government collusion with aliens and subsequent cover-ups); the \"Roswell\" or \"Hangar 18\" case in which small aliens were reportedly removed from a crashed UFO and per- manently hidden from the public; government Blue Book projects; the Rendlesham Forest and Socorro sightings — and sightings from many of the 50 states and other nations.

In my letter I mentioned my discovery, in May 1991, that Rex had appeared on a \"Current Affair\" TV show early in 1990 to say that he had seen a UFO that looked \"exactly like\" what Ed had photographed. In my letter I presented a very short transcript of the show to illustrate Rex's testimony. In August I received an \"Open Letter\" from Rex Salisberry in which he says I have been spreading a false story that he had claimed to have \"seen a UFO which resembled 'Ed's craft.' \" He then goes on to say that \"as you well know, the context of my comments for that inter- view dealt with the red light sighting at the Pensacola MUFON meeting in September. My comments in that regard were accurate. The dim red glow I saw in the sky did resemble the dim red image in the photograph allegedly taken by Walters outside of the meeting place that night.\" Rex states, \"I have never seen, nor have I claimed to have seen, an unidentified flying object which resembled any of the photos shown in Walter's book.\" I shall take Rex at his word and apologize for my mistake. However, perhaps I can be forgiven for this er- ror, since I did not \"well know\" that he was talking about the \"red light.\" The context of the show in which Rex appeared most certainly did not indicate the Rex was talking about the Septem- ber 12, 1989 \"red light\" sighting. The Gulf Breeze segment of the \"Current Affair\" show begins (with Vince Lapari acting as the interviewer and narrator): \"Perhaps the most recent of the highly publicized UFO cases is the one down in Gulf Breeze, Florida. Over a period of nearly two years, hundreds of witnesses have said they have seen fly- ing saucers in the sky. Now these are not mental patients or quacks. These are city councilmen, doctors, lawyers, businessmen, who have a lot to lose by telling such bizarre stories.\" At this point several of Ed's photos are shown and the story shifts to Shirley McCon- nell telling 6f how she and her husband saw a large cylindrical craft with win- dows over the water near their house in July 1988. (Note: when interviewed for \"Unsolved Mysteries\" she stated explicity that what she saw was like the object that appears in Ed's photos and she doesn't know how he could have hoaxed what she and her husband saw over the bay that morning.) The Cur- rent Affair documentary then shows more of Ed's photos and refers to stories in the Gulf Breeze Sentinel. Lapari con- tinues, \"Most of the spectacular photos were taken by one man who claims he was abducted. He is not talking until his book comes out, but many other witnesses are.\" At this point the interview of Rex Salisberry begins with \"What makes you so sure?\" to which Rex answered \"Because you could compare it with the stars, the planets... it was larger than stars or planets ... and later on I saw the photographs that Ed took (at this point the video shows one of Ed's photos) and what he had on the photographs looked exactly like what I saw.\" Immediately after Rex finished, the documentary switched to Lisette French telling of her sighting. Hence the context of the Gulf Breeze segment was totally directed toward Ed's original series of sightings and photos. There was no hint that any other sightings were being discussed. I mentioned my \"discovery\" of Rex's statement to Ed Walters and Gary Watson. Neither suggested that Rex was referring to the red light sighting. (Wat- son was present at the interview with Rex; perhaps he couldn't recall the ex- act subject of the discussion when I mentioned it over a year later.) Rex is certainly not the first person to be \"ambushed\" by the media by having his statements placed in the wrong context; my own statements have been used out of context occa- sionally. Removing Rex from the list of people who claim to have seen 'Ed's craft' does not change things very much: there still are over a dozen witnesses who say they saw it. Prob- LETTERS ably the most important result of this microcontroversy has been Rex's reaf- firmation of seeing the \"red\" light which, as of this writing (early September), has been seen almost 80 times by probably over a hundred witnesses. Several of the sightings have been triangulated with photographic recording allowing size estimates in the range of tens of feet. More specific in- formation will be presented in a series of articles on these sightings. — Bruce Maccabee Dear Editor: I have learned to appreciate all your fine editorials.

The yellowish object lies low in the South at dusk and sets in the WSW about 9 PM in midmonth. The Moon is only 2° above the planet on the 12th. Bright Planets: (Morning Sky) Venus (-4.3) and Jupiter (-2.0) have separated to some 20° apart in the SE by mid-November. Jupiter rises first in the East about 12:30, followed by Venus two hours later. The latter reaches a point farthest West of the Sun on the 2nd, the same morning that a crescent Moon passes to the right of the brilliant planet. The Moon also passes Jupiter on November 1 and 29. Meteor Showers: The South Taurid meteors peak on the morning of the 2nd at 10 to 15 per hour. Best to observe them before 2 AM when the crescent Moon rises. The shower, however, is fairly spread out and can be seen in decreasing numbers through the entire month. Look for relatively slow, reddish streaks (many are bright) radiating across the sky from Taurus the Bull. While the Taurids can be observed throughout the night, the Leonids are primarily a morning shower. A gibbous Moon also brightens the heavens on the peak morning of the 18th until about 3 AM, leaving about two hours of dark sky with which to see the meteors. About 15 Leonids per hour dart swiftly out of Leo's Sickle in the SE. Moon Phases: New moon — November 6 First quarter — November 14 Full moon — November 21 Last quarter — November 28 The Stars: C. o At 9 PM the Summer Triangle nears the West horizon, while the bright pat- terns of winter appear in the East — Orion, Taurus, Auriga and Gemini. The dim autumn constellations of \"The Sea\" and the season's sky symbol Pegasus occupy the middle sky. Be sure to observe the Andromeda spiral galaxy with naked eye, binoculars or telescope. This system of billions of stars (visible as an oval patch) lies right on the north-south meridian almost directly overhead at 9PM. Meanwhile, in the north the Big Dipper has swung as low as it ever gets in northern latitudes and appears right side up on the horizon. The Pointer Stars (the two easternmost stars on the Dipper's bowl) aim at Polaris the North Star. A pointer line continued an equal distance beyond Polaris brings you to M- shaped Cassiopeia the Queen. Like the Big Dipper, Cassiopeia never sets from the northern states and is best placed for evening observation at this time. LOOKING BACK, Continued ground. It was something I had never seen before. I believe in UFOs now, although I had been very skeptical before.\" Tazawa Takumi, an air traffic controller, was on duty at Akita tower when he noticed the object. \"I grabbed a pair of binoculars and got a very close look at it. It looked like two plates placed together, with the top one in- verted. I wasn't sure of their existence before, but after what I saw I certainly believe in them now.\" A television reporter, Masaki Machida, had been assigned by Akita Broadcasting Co. to do a story on pilot training. \"I watched the object descending from the east,\" Machida said. After staying in a fixed position for five minutes, the UFO flew off in the direction of the sea. The whole thing was the most incredible ex- perience that ever happened to me on the job.\" (The National Enquirer, 1/4/77) UFO NEWSCLIPPING SERVICE The UFO Newsclipping Service will keep you informed of all the latest United States and World-Wide UFO reports (i.e., little known photographic cases, close encounters and landing reports, occupant cases) and all other UFO reports, many of which are car- ried only in small town and foreign newspapers.

Amateur Radio Net David Dobbs (Cincinnati, OH) AA8DK, net control station for the MUFON Amateur Radio Net, has an- nounced a few revisions in the net operation. The 80 meter net now meets every Saturday evening at 9 p.m. EDT or EST on 3.929 MHz. (Formerly, it was at 10 p.m. on 3.990 MHz.) The 10 meter net each Thursday at 8 p.m. on 28.460 MHz, has been discontinued. These revisions appear in the September 1991 issue of the Journal and hereafter. Leslie Varnicle, the Net Manager, has now moved back to Englewood, CO and will be checking into the nets when she has her anten- nae installed at that location. MUFON UFO Symposia The MUFON 1992 International UFO Symposium will be held in downtown Albuquerque, NM on July 10, 11 and 12, hosted by Teresa Brito- Asenap and MUFON of New Mexico. The hotel name will be announced after the contract is signed. The symposium theme has not been finalized. For future symposia planning, the regional location and year is being presented so that host groups may evaluate their interests and potential to sponsor a symposia in one of their cities and submit a written bid to Walt Andrus or their Regional Director. Each year the symposium rotates between the three regions of the United States. The Eastern Region will host the 1993 event, Cen- tral Region in 1994, Western Region in 1995 and back to the Eastern Region in 1996. Considering the problems that we had in 1982 in Toronto, Ontario with moving photo exhibits and proceedings through the \"border brokers\" in Canada, the Canadian Regional location has been placed on temporary hold.

MUFON Souvenirs The Mutual UFO Network has refrained from commercializing and selling MUFON or UFO souvenirs, however, as in the past, we support this activity by a few of our members as a convenience to interested people. Baseball caps, T-shirts, coffee mugs, bumper stickers, etc. have always been popular items for sale at UFO symposia and conferences throughout the years. James S. Greenen displayed and sold current items at the 1991 symposium. Anyone interested in purchasing ap- proved MUFON souvenirs may write and request an order form from In- ternational UFO Center, 11955 S.

Scott Grain's new book UPOs, MJ-12 and the Government: A Report on Government Involvement in UFO Crash Retrievals, published by the Mutual UFO Net- work, Inc. (113 pages), is another view of the intrigue and people associated with this controversial issue. This well written and documented book is essen- tial to the library of everyone interested in the UFO crash/retrieval syndrome. It may be purchased from MUFON for $19 plus $1.50 for postage and handling. News from British Columbia Veteran UFO researcher and speaker at the MUFON 1979 UFO Symposium in San Francisco, CA, William \"Bill\" K. Allan, has suffered a stroke which has limited his correspondence throughout the world. Bill would en- joy receiving news and letters from his friends and colleagues in Ufology at the following address: 3899 Truswell Rd., Kelowna, BC V1Y 1X8, Canada. Author, publisher and former Provin- cial Director for British Columbia, John F. Magor, has been similarly af- flicted. Both continue to subscribe to the Journal and other publications so as to keep abreast of the latest news and events in their UFO environment. Mr. Magor formerly edited and published the leading UFO magazine in Canada, Canadian UFO Report. Readers may write to John at P.O. Box 758, Duncan, BC V9L 3Y1, Canada. Please remember both of these gentlemen with your notes and letters. William \"Bill\" K. Allan MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 282 October 1991"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"XKrector's ^Message Walt Andrus Joint American-Soviet Aerial Anomaly Federation On September 3, 1991 your Interna- tional Director was the first signature on the founding agreement for the pro- posed Joint American-Soviet Aerial Anomaly Federation (JASAAF) that was approved by the MUFON Board of Directors on July 6, 1991. The organiza- tion is being spearheaded in the U.S.A. by Dr. Richard F. Haines and in the U.S.S.R. by Dr. Vladimir V. Rubtsov, MUFON Representative for the U.S.S.R. Founding cosigners to this Agree- ment are the following organizations: Mutual UFO Network; Fund for UFO Research; J. Allen Hynek Center for UFO Studies, in the U.S.A. and in the U.S.S.R.: Expert Committee on UFO of the Academy of Sciences USSR; Novosibirsk Study Group; Minsk UFO Study Group and the Dalnegorsk UFO Study Group. A copy of the Preamble and Resolutions dated March 24, 1991 was supplied to MUFON Board of Directors prior to the annual meeting in Chicago. Some of the near-term activities planned for JASAAF are (1) Develop a chronological and geographic case file of Soviet cases; (2) Begin an English translation of Dr. Felix Zigel's works: (3) Develop a directory of key in- dividuals in the Soviet Union and America for use by affiliated member organizations; and (4) Provide limited Russian to English translation of selected articles and reports. MUFON has had a translated copy of nearly half of Dr. Zigel's works for 19 years and published excerpts in our monthly magazine SKYLOOK (predecessor to the MUFON UFO Jour- nal). After Ed Komarek's visit to the U.S.S.R. in June 1991, MUFON sign- ed a formal exchange agreement with the Yeisk Club of Abnormal Pheno- mena on June 21, 1991. As an organiza- tion, MUFON heartily supports the new JASAAF. Presently, seven com- plimentary copies of the MUFON UFO Journal are being mailed to key UFO leaders in the U.S.S.R. as part of our ongoing program for cooperation. We do not feel that the recent reorganiza- tions within the U.S.S.R. will deter these agreements. The freedom ex- pressed by the civilian population and individual Republics will be beneficial to the expansion of the JASAAF in the U.S.S.R. Stringfield's UFO Crash / Retrievals Leonard Stringfield's long-awaited monograph titled UFO Crash /Retrie- vals: The Inner Sanctum: Status Report VI, dated July 1991 (142 pages), is now available from MUFON in Seguin, Texas and from Mr. Stringfield in Cin- cinnati, OH for $17 plus $1.50 postage and handling. We have invited Leonard to write an article briefly summarizing the contents of his well researched book as an introduction to this announce- ment. He received the first copies from the printer on September 13, 1991 and promptly mailed Walt Andrus a copy on that date. With the reopening of the Roswell Crash Case, publication of the paperback book UFO Crash at Roswell by Kevin Randle and Donald Schmitt and the forthcoming hardback from Paragon on the same subject by Don Berliner and Stanton Friedman, Leonard's contribution on other possi- ble crashes and disclosures is very op- portune. This is recommended reading for anyone interested in the stories and rumors of crashed UFOs and retrieval of crafts and entities. New Officers Hal Starr has resigned as Arizona State Director effective October 1st so that he and his wife Bea may move to their recently purchased home in Alamos, Sonora, Mexico.
