Crop circles are large highly organized patterns, usually appearing in fields of grain, such as grass, wheat, barley, or corn, where the crops have become mysteriously flat- tened to the ground in a very short time. Often the matted areas have the form of circles or rings, but they can also appear as rectangles, linear swaths, or arc-like shapes. Based on the various characteristics that have been reported, crop circle researchers have concluded that the circles are formed by some kind of advanced microwave beam technology. Most crop circles appear overnight, although some have been reported to form in full daylight. One forma- tion appeared in a field in between successive aerial sur- veillance flights spaced just half an hour apart. Quick formations Crop circle researcher Colin Andrews reports that of a group of seventy people who claimed to have witnessed crop circles in the process of being formed, all agreed that the laying of the crop occurred in no more than 15 seconds! They described the event as being preceded by a sudden silencing of the song birds, the stillness in the air being broken by a \"trilling sound\" accompanied by the sound of wheat heads banging together, despite an absence of wind. In one case the sound was captured on magnetic tape, and subsequent analysis found it to be beating at a frequency of 5.2 kilohertz. Crop circles have been observed since the 1970's, with the documented sightings now numbering over ten thou- sand. Although most of the occurrences have taken place in the British Isles, formations have also been reported in the U.S., Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Tasmania, France, Switzerland, Russia, and Brazil. In earlier years the designs were relatively simple, consisting mainly of circular matted regions. Later, more elaborate designs began to appear, such as circles surrounded by a series of concentric rings. Often several circles might be found clustered together to form well defined geometrical patterns, sometimes in- terconnected by perfectly straight \"avenues.\" Beginning in 1990, the crop circle phenomenon dra- matically intensified. Not only was there an exponential increase in their numbers, but also there was a dramatic increase in the size of the patterns/Every year heralded the appearance of new types of designs. Whereas ear- lier designs consisted mostly of simple circle and ring About the Author Dr. LaViolette is the author of five books, including Be- yond the Big Bang and Earth Under Fire. His latest book, The Talk of the Galaxy, was reviewed in the March issue of the MUFON UFO Journal, and this article is excerpted from that book (pages 138-148), courtesy of Starlane Publications. LaViolette re- ceived the B.A. in physics from Johns Hopkins, and his Ph.D. in system theory from Portland State. He is president of the Starburst Foundation research institute, has been active in the fields of physics, astronomy, and geology, and has conducted ob- servations with the VLA radio telescope. LaViolette is a full member of the American As- tronomical Society. His website is Sphinx Stargate <http:/ /www.etheric.com/ patterns ranging up to about 20 meters in diameter, now patterns began appearing which stretched out over sev- eral hundred meters. Moreover these new designs were far more complex. Although disposed in two dimensions, some of the new patterns represented higher dimensional fractal forms like the \"Mandelbrot set\" crop glyph. The Mandelbrot set is generated by performing a specific mathematical opera- tion on a complex number and repeating the operation by taking the product of the previous calculation and using it as input for the next calculation. Two of these complex patterns appeared in wheat fields in 1991, one in Ecleton, England and the other at Barbury Castle, Wiltshire, England. Equally complex crop circle fractals depicting the Julia set appeared in July 1996. A single Julia set spiral composed of 151 circles stretching out over a diameter of 400 feet appeared in a wheat field near the ancient monument of Stonehenge. That same month a triple Julia set spiral appeared in a wheat field at Windmill Hill, England. It was composed of 194 circles that stretched out over a distance of 700 feet. Within a crop circle's compacted region, the plant stems are found compressed to the ground so firmly as to leave their indentations in the soil, yet their stems are not broken or damaged. They sometimes splay radially outward from the circles' centers, but more often are angled so as to form Archimedian spirals, sometimes proceeding clock- wise, other times counterclockwise, and on occasion a combination of both. The combined contrarotating spirals are particularly perplexing because the direction of the rotary lay abruptly flips at a well-defined boundary. On one side of this bor-"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Page 4 April 2001 MUFON UFO Journal der, a stem would lie in one direction while its immediate -neighbor on the other side of the border would lie in the opposite direction. A 90-degree flip The crop circle that appeared at Cheesefpot Head in 1987 exhibited a clockwise spiral pattern that was de- formed in the circle's northern sector to form a radial swath directed northward (see illustration on the front cover). Near the center of the circle, this north-aligned pattern made a surprisingly sharp 90-degree flip transi- tion to the spiral pattern. Yet another spiral crop formation had a central patch measuring two meters square in which the stems all faced in the same direction with the spiral pattern emerging out- ward from the square's periphery. Braided or plaited lay patterns have also been found in which bundles of stems have been left overlying one an- other in alternating directions, giving the appearance of a basket weave when viewed from afar. Crop circle re- searchers have puzzled over how these complex weaves could be formed. In their book Circular Evidence, re- searchers Pat Delgado and Colin Andrews state: Some of the bundles have had two or more bundles laid at differing angles over and under them so that they are actually intertwined. The force field that produced this would have to be operating like a knitting machine. On two occasions, in two differ- ent circles, some bundles of these braids have been laid in opposition to each other. There seems to be no limit to the complication of lay that this extraordi- nary unknown force can produce.' Even more detailed crop knitting has been noted. For example, crop circle researcher Ilyes observes that the crop within a circle is laid in bundles composed of any- where from a few plant stalks to as many as forty or fifty 2 The stalks in a bundle are aligned parallel to one an- other and are bound together by their leaves which wrap around in criss-crossing fashion. Ilyes notes that, outside the crop circle perimeter, the seed heads of the standing crop are randomly oriented. On the other hand, within each bundle, the seed heads are parallel to one another, as if commonly aligned by an applied force. Evidence of heating More than just mechanical force is involved in creating the crop formations. There is overwhelming and consis- tent evidence that the crop has been heated during the crop circle forming process, for expulsion cavities called \"blown nodes\" are seen at the sides of individual stalks. Biophysicist Dr. W. C. Levengood produced similar results in the laboratory by inducing a very rapid rate of heating. 3 Ilyes postulates that crop circles are formed by a microwave maser beam projected down from above, and that associated cellular heating effects cause the fluid within the plant cells to expand and erupt through a node The Dharma Wheel, which is said to represent the eightfold path of human spiritual development, represented by each symbol, appeared in 1992 near Silbury Hill. The outer part of the design passes through a physical cattle trough. or joint in the stalk's surface. She also suggests that the crop stalks suddenly wilt and become supple as their plant cells dehydrate and ex- pand during this brief heating phase. In this way they are susceptible to being reoriented by the applied force, with- out being broken. Transient high temperatures Other tests carried out by Levengood have shown that the molecular and cellular structure of the plants has be- come substantially changed with distinct signs that they have been exposed to transient high temperatures. 4 Seeds taken from inside a crop circle formation have been found to be altered both with respect to their growth rate and their mode of germination. When the seeds are planted, their growth rates in some cases are seen to have become increased by as much as 45%. Moreover, ex- tended observation of the crop circles shows that, once the plants have been laid flat by this force, their head ends never attempt to grow vertically again. Researchers have found that crop circles are pervaded by a residual energy field that remains for some weeks after the circle's formation, an effect reminiscent of Zinsser's observations of a \"residual force.\" Investiga- tors Ron Russell and Dr. Simeon Hein have used a por- table TREK-520 electrometer to make electric field mea- surements of several crop circles in the Wiltshire, En- gland region. Their findings indicated the presence of a \"membrane\" at the outer edge of crop circles, across which the mea- sured field energy shifts first lower, then perceptibly higher. These spike-like energy variations were also found in the interiors of crop circles, at the edges of internal details, and especially at the centers of the circles. They found that they had to wait several days before"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal April 2001 Page 5 entering a newly formed crop circle because otherwise the field energy would cause their electronic equipment to malfunction and their power supply batteries to rap- idly drain. It is commonly reported that the batteries of cell phones, GPS devices, magnetometers, video cam- eras and tape recorders drain rapidly within crop circle formations. This calls to mind reports of car engines stalling and radios going dead during UFO close encoun- ters. The unusual growth phenomena, residual fields, and complex way in which the compaction patterns are formed have led researchers to conclude that those crop circles cannot have been produced by common hoaxers using simple hand tools. Delgado and Andrews summarize the crop circle phenomenon as follows: Any specification for a force that can produce all these complications will have to include the fol- lowing features: flattening crop stems of various thicknesses hard to the ground without damage, spiral whorl rotation, contra-rotation, multilayering containing multi-direction lays, blast-effect radial swathes, and all the different central area forma- tions. Not only must the force be able to lay the crop in either direction of rotation, it must be able to do both rotations without gradation on the floor of the same circle. It must be a strong force of short duration that induces horizontal growing into the plant, replac- ing its natural tendency to the vertical... It must also be able to make the root end of thickstemmed plants pliable enough to bend to a sharp, almost 90-degree angle, without fracturing and disturbing the plants' growth rate. It must be able to construct a flattened ring around the outside of a circle, closely following the contour of the circle wall. Besides creating circular shapes, it must also be able to flatten a dead straight pathway several meters long. It should have the ability to miss narrow, arc-shaped areas of crop and so leave these stems standing, like a low, slim, curved screen. It must be so vio- lent that some plants are pulled up randomly or ejected from the soil and thrown into the periph- eral standing crop. It must be quiet. It is very sobering to stand in one of these circles and ponder what force could have arrived and departed, leaving behind this beautiful record of its visit with no clue as to how it was achieved. 5 Unusual force One farmer who witnessed the creation of a ringed circle in his small corn patch in Romania described the force as so strong that it tore away his hat and flung him to the ground. It was accompanied by a \"terrible whis- tling sound.\" 6 This same force could explain why a jack rabbit carcass was found inside one crop circle dehydrated and compressed to a pancake. Also crop circle researcher Donna Higbee describes several cases in Canada and England in which crop circles have been found to contain compressed por- cupines. Porcupines, which normally stand at least 12 inches tall, have been compressed down to two to three inches by some tremendous force. She notes that porcupines stay put when they detect danger, relying on their sharp quills for defense. Hence there is less likelihood that they would flee at the time the circle was being formed. Higbee also reports instances in which porcupines were forcefully dragged into a crop circle. She states: Also, there have been at least two cases where a skid mark in the soil, embedded with broken quills, showed the unfortunate porcupine had been dragged by force from the edge of the formation into the cen- ter. Its quills were oriented in the same direction as the swirled wheat.7 A technology capable of projecting a force field to a remote farm field to bend stalks of wheat or blades of grass could also be made to project a force field that could bend the trajectories of cosmic ray particles in space. Moreover a force field technology able to create intricate patterns in fields of vegetation could also be made to modulate forces near the surface of a cosmic ray emitting star to produce synchrotron pulses similar to those observed coming from pulsars. Are the hundreds of crop circles being produced each year the result of force field projection experiments being carried out by our own scientists working in secret military programs? Or, are these messages being left by extrater- restrial visitors who are trying to display for us the same technology that they use to produce pulsar signals and star shields? An ETI Connection? There have been many cases where unconventional fly- ing objects have been sighted either at the time crop circles were being formed or just prior to their appearance. In none of the documented cases has anyone seen or met the oc- cupants of these vehicles, so we cannot be certain whether they are from here or from out there. Nevertheless, given that these vehicles utilize a very ad- vanced method of propulsion that could be used for flight beyond the Earth's atmosphere, the idea that they may be piloted by extraterrestrials remains a very real possibility. Delgado and Andrews recount one incident that took place in England over Silbury Hill. 8 A woman was driving home late one night in July of 1988 when she noticed a large, golden, disc-shaped object hovering within the cloud cover. A bright parallel beam of white light projected down- ward from the disc at roughly a 65 degree angle to a spot a few kilometers away. While she was observing this, a \"surge of energy\" passed"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Page 6 April 2001 MUFON UFO Journal through her car, at which point half a dozen articles that had been stored in a pocket on her dashboard suddenly rose up and flew backwards onto her lap and onto the passenger seat next to her. One day later, ten crop circles were discovered at about the location where the beam had been directed. Another five circles appeared several days later, and still others were discovered two months later. Another sighting was made in 1991 by two Japanese boys. Roy Dutton, who recounts their story, writes: As the boys watched, a pillar of \"transparent white steam or smoke\" [was] generated downwards from be- neath the hovering [glowing orange object]. The pillar re- volved and grew wider towards the base, \"giving the im- pression of a trumpet.\" When the base came into contact with the grass, a flattened ring was produced, about 30 cm wide... Immediately after, the [grass was flattened], the 'trumpet' was retracted, and the object shot back into the sky.\" Physical effects One of the young men commented that he felt \"a warm wind and drops of water on [my] face\" as he watched the grass being whirled down. As he stood transfixed, he reported that he simultaneously heard a \"low alternating sound\" transliterated as \"gu-on, gu-on.\" 9 Crop circle photographer Steven Alexander has shot a video that shows a luminous sphere meandering over a crop circle days after the circle had been formed. One eyewitness who saw the sphere up close said that it was about the size of a basketball. Another researcher, Peter Glastonbury, witnessed luminous spheres in a crop field near his home in England. He states: After fifteen minutes, we heard sounds that were very much like the crackling you hear around your head when taking off a heavy woolen sweater. My daughter and I both saw a small ball of light hover- ing in the crop. Through binoculars, I could see sev- eral small balls orbiting into a central point. It was dipping in and out of the crop. The next day we dis- covered a formation exactly where we had heard the crackling sounds and saw the light the night be- fore. 10 UFO landings in fields have also been found to leave behind circular swirl patterns. These are presumably pro- duced by the saucer's propulsion beam. In Australia, these lay patterns have become known as UFO \"nests.\" These usually have a much rougher form than crop circle de- signs, their edges not being as sharply defined. The veg- etation within them exhibits signs of nonchemical wither- ing, and analysis has shown that some of the changes could have been produced by powerful microwave radia- tion.\" NASA scientist Paul Hill has gathered considerable information from numerous UFO sightings suggesting that force field beams are commonly used by UFOs as a This design at Silbury Hill is 250 feet in diam- eter and made up of 126 circles, and was reportedly created in the daytime. (©Freddy Silva 1997) method of propulsion. 12 One of the documented UFO encounter cases he reviews took place in Greece near the villages of Digeliotica and Agiou Apostolou. 13 ' l4 One evening in February 1959 people living there re- ported seeing a luminous disc emitting a humming noise and circling over the two villages for about 10 minutes. Radios failed to operate, and the current in one house went dead. The disc flew low over one house and, as it did, the force of its propulsion beam caused the house to shake and its roof tiles to clatter loudly, making its occupant think that there was an earthquake. When the villagers later inspected the house, they found that many of its roof tiles had been displaced and that others were lying on the ground. We might theorize that in producing its propulsion beam, a UFO spacecraft is projecting downward an intense col- umn of Tesla-type microwave radiation; that is, shock- type microwave emissions that have the ability to exert forces on the material they intercept. As Tesla observed, shock emissions tend to collimate themselves into a beam. However, to further ensure that the beam's energy is not scattered and dissipated once it strikes the ground, the UFO propulsion system might further utilize the technol- ogy of phase conjugation. Accordingly, the microwaves reflected back from the ground towards the spacecraft propulsion apparatus would enter a mixer chamber which would generate an outgoing phase conjugate beam of the ground reflected \"probe\" beam, the two counterpropagating beams being locked together in phase with one another. A phase conjugate resonator? Consequently, the downward directed phase conjugate microwaves that the spacecraft was emitting, upon re-"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal April 2001 Page 7 flection, would faithfully return to the spacecraft propul- sion apparatus. The spacecraft propulsion apparatus and the Earth's surface, then, would together function as a phase conjugate resonator, allowing microwave radiation to build up within the beam to a very high intensity. The upper end of this resonant column of \"solid\" ra- diation would push up against the spacecraft as the lower end pushed down against the Earth's surface, thereby lofting the spacecraft against the Earth's gravitational pull. Research carried out by James Woodward, a profes- sor of physics at Cal State Fullerton, indicates that elec- tromagnetic waves can induce lofting forces in piezoelec- tric ceramic media. His ideas are described in a 1994 U.S. patent (No. 5,280,864) and in a physics journal ar- ticle (\"Foundations of Physics Letters,\" vol. 3(5), 1990). Woodward has conducted experiments that confirm this thrust effect in the audio frequency range (-10,000 Hertz), and his calculations suggest that this thrust may be substantially increased at higher frequencies, with op- timal performance being obtained in the microwave range (0.1 to 10 gigahertz).) The microwave beam technology that a UFO uses to buoy itself upward may be the same one that is being used to form crop circles. UFO sightings indicate that these craft can project several beams at one time and can control not only the direction in which they aim the beams but also the degree to which the beams diverge. By studying the intricate crop circle patterns we can learn something about the sophistication of this propulsion beam technology. The beams would need to have a reso- lution of the order of just a few milli meters to create crop lay patterns having the kind of sharp-edged boundaries that are observed. Also they would have to be capable not only of pushing but also of pulling, in some cases even uprooting individual stalks. To produce the swirling of the lay patterns, the beam phase conjugator apparatus must be able to induce a vor- tical component to its beamed force field. The unusually complex weaving and braiding seen in the crop circle pat- terns suggests that the creators of these designs have very precise and rapid control over their microwave beam \"paintbrushes.\" The 5200 Hz ultrasonic beat frequency that has been detected in one crop circle and the \"gu-on, gu-on\" sound that was reported to be heard at another sighting would seem to suggest that the crop circle makers produce beams that contain many microwave frequencies whose differ- ent frequencies produce harmonics in the sonic or ultra- sonic range. Moreover by properly phasing these various frequen- cies relative to one another, the beam generator could be made to control the waveform shape of these summed waves and hence the intensity of the force that they gen- erate. By using two or more beam generators, it should be possible to employ conventional microwave interfer- ometry techniques to laterally order the intensity and di- rection of these forces across the diameter of a crop circle pattern. The same force field projection technology that is used for UFO propulsion and crop circle making, and that also appears to be used in highly secret military projects for producing aerial fireball weapons, may be the same tech- nology that extraterrestrial civilizations are using to pro- duce pulsar signals.

Andrews' report on crop circles Colin Andrews, founder of Circles Phenomenon Re- search International, has concluded the following: \"My findings at this time are that ample evidence ex- ists that an estimated 80 % of crop circles are man-made. On the other hand, 20 % revealed no evidence of human involvement. A handful of these 20% also displayed the newly discovered magnetic profile (all these were simple formations). All investigation has been done on crop circles in the UK, and therefore the results refer only to the situ- ation in the UK.\""},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"Page 8 April 2001 MUFON UFO Journal An update The 'promise of ufology' By Dr. Ron Westrum About twenty-one years ago I wrote an essay entitled \"The Promise of UFOlogy.\" This essay was written as a reply to an article by James Oberg, who had just won the substantial Cutty Sark prize for the best article on UFOs. (Oberg's article was printed in New Scientist, Oct. 11, 1979. Mine was printed in Frontiers of Science, Nov./ Dec. 1980.) I felt that there were many problems with Oberg's ar- guments, so I decided to rebut them. I came across a copy of my article the other day, and I thought MUFON members might like to hear my further reflections on this subject. Has the promise been fulfilled? I think the answer must be \"no.\" But haven't we made progress? Absolutely! Then what is the difficulty? Let me explain In his essay, Oberg's major point was that UFOlogy was a largely uncritical pursuit, and that UFOlogists cared very little about truth. Thus they were willing to take seri- ously a large mass of data that did not deserve serious treatment, and that was explainable anyway. I argued very strongly that UFOlogists were in fact a fairly contentious community, and that contrary to Mr. Oberg's representations, there were many parts of the UFO evidence that were not only unexplained, but that were eminently worthy of being looked into. Memory fails as to whether Mr. Oberg made any reply to this, but I would still hold with the arguments I made then. With 21 years additional experience, however, I now see things that I then did not see, insights provoked in part by having to write an essay for David Jacob's recent ed- ited volume on UFOs and Abductions. A failure to connect One of the things I see is that UFOlogists have not connected with the scientific community. I know my col- leagues will immediately protest and say, \"But that's not our fault! We have been rejected!\" Which of course is true; but that is not the whole truth. It is correct that UFOlogists have suffered at the hands of both the scientific community and the popular science writers who often ally themselves with mainstream sci- ence, and also at the hands of CSICOP. I could cite chap- ter and verse on this, but I believe that most readers can easily cite examples of this rejection and persecution. What happened to James McDonald and his testimony on the SST is only the most flagrant example. But while scientists have often treated UFOlogists badly, UFOlogisls have done very little to remedy the situation. UFOlogy is an isolated pursuit. While we occasionally pull in psychology, sociology, or physics when we need About the Author Dr. Westrum is Professor of Sociology and Interdisci- plinary Technology at Eastern Michigan University. Ron is the author of numerous articles on the sociology of sci- ence and technology, as well as three books, the most recent being Sidewinder: Creative Missile Development at China Lake (Naval Institute Press, 1999). Ron is a scientific consultant for MUFON in sociology. explanations, we seldom treat UFOlogy as, for instance, part of psychology, part of sociology, or even part of as- tronomy. A lack of continuity We don't see any continuity between what the SETI community is trying to do and what we are doing. We don't try to answer questions for SETI, and in fact you have to search very hard to find any reference to SETI research in the UFO community. True, the SETI commu- nity has worked hard to avoid association with UFOs, but what stops the UFOlogist from reading SETI literature? Mostly, I believe, the idea that there is nothing there worth- while to learn. But is SETI truly a desert, and if not, why don't we bother to find some connections? SETI has its own problems, and its biggest is that fund- ing is usually miniscule and easily cut off. Hence the SETI researchers are not too eager to be associated with UFOlogy. Some years ago I contacted several SETI sci- entists and found that in fact they were interested in UFOs, off the record, and in some cases had read the literature. But little has been done to aid these closet readers of the UFO literature. And much might be gained by doing some SETI theorizing of our own. But the truth is, we like our isolation. We think we have something that the main- stream scientific community does not, and perhaps we are right. This does not justify our isolation, however. Let me put this more clearly. We have not tried to put the work we do in the context of the mainstream scien- tific literature. There are theories in mainstream science that could connect with what we do. At the very least we ought to note the theories that our data appear to contra- dict. Our work on the UFO evidence is made to oppose common sense, not scientific theory. When Dave Jacobs spins out his theories of human- alien contact, the majority of his data is based on hypno- sis. Yet Dave has not done any research on hypnosis, and in his books he seldom cites research work on hypnosis by others. This doesn't mean he is wrong. It does mean that there are connections he has failed to make. Ditto for connecting with SETI. The failure to connect with the SETI community hurts us, because we fail to draw them into our work, and we fail to benefit from theirs. Each community appears to ignore the others. I am not passing out blame. I am simply noting a fact. I think connection would be good for us."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal April 2001 Page 9 But even in our isolated world, we have failed to check and to synthesize what we know. Let me deal with lack of synthesis first. While there is no lack of compilations, the most eminent of which is Jerome Clark's marvelous Encyclopedia, we have failed to put things together. Take abductions, the hottest topic. While there are good books on abductions, there is nothing that summarizes and synthesizes the research of the various researchers. The MIT conference many years ago provided a forum, but it was~a one-shot affair. And afterward, everybody went back to doing their particular projects. It is not clear that we have progressed a lot since then. A lack of good literature And then add the lack of good textbooks, any sort of regular scientific meeting, I would almost say the lack of a journal—• yet the Journal of UFO Studies sort of meets this need, except it is published too infrequently. (MUFON's journal is more like a newsletter than a sci- entific journal, even though it includes some fine articles) True, we have the Society for Scientific Exploration, but there is no equivalent to the Parapsychological Asso- ciation, which includes mostly Ph.D's, for UFOlogy. And of course, in our minds we do synthesize this stuff, putting it all together in some kind of meaningful frame- work. What we don't do is articulate this synthesis by writing it down systematically, and exposing it to the scru- tiny of other intelligent folks. Failure to test our assumptions is also a serious fault. Much of the data we gather has a strong \"confirmation bias,\" and we steer clear of checking what we think we know. A very good example is what happened to our large survey on abduction-related symptoms, Unusual Personal Experiences, carried out some years ago. The major conclusion of the survey is that about one in fifty persons in the population showed a set of symptoms that we know are associated with abduction experiences. While the authors received a hefty dose of criticism, some of it deserved; some not, the really sad thing is that rather than being a step in a long process of replication and evalu- ation, the survey was either accepted or rejected as it stood. It was not replicated by outsiders, to test their criti- cisms to see if they were correct. Nor was the data in any sense completely exploited by the original research- ers. The results that were so widely disseminated were in fact only a small fraction of the total information con- tained in the survey, which in principle could have been accessed by any qualified researcher. Nobody bothered. Note that, for instance, ten questions were added to the survey that could have been used as indicators. We used five. We could have seen whether positive responses to the questions we used might have predicted responses to the others, but we didn't. And when the sponsor (Robert Bigelow) repeated the survey, it was done without the participation of the origi- nal designers. As a result, we now have unexplained re- sults, big differences in the frequency of the important responses, with no clue as to what these differences mean. The internal checks that might be made into the data have simply not been performed. Not only have the origi- nal authors (including myself) not performed these checks, but no one else has either. Does no one care? Has any- one noticed? This apparent indifference to method and verification has causes. In part it reflects the conditions of work that we all labor under (such as making a living doing some- thing else), as well as the vagaries of the funding sources. Then there are the irrational and unfair critics. We have lots of excuses. But we have also these dangling facts that require checking, verification, and contexualization. What is true of Unusual Personal Experiences is actu- ally the general case in what we do. There are lots of checks that we could make that we don't bother to do. Take the case of the hybrid babies. Has anyone done a systematic study to track down the doctors who made the diagnosis of pregnancy? The boyfriends who thought their girlfriends were cheating on them, and etc., etc.? There is a long list of things that we could do to check our assumptions that we haven't done. For instance art- ists and writers are probably as likely to be abducted as anybody else, and these experiences are likely to show up in their work. Has anybody bothered to interview, for instance, the friends of Robert Heinlein, to find out why abduction themes (e.g. in his book The Puppet Masters) creep into so much of his fiction? Our knowledge is insecure All the things we seem to believe imply things we could check, but that we don't check. We do not subject our \"knowledge\" to the tests it ought to have. We don't want to risk our ideas suffering the fate of \"a beautiful Hy- pothesis slain by an ugly gang of Facts,\" to quote H. G. Wells. So ultimately our \"knowledge\" is very insecure. Dave Jacobs' book The Threat is a good example. When I read The Threat I felt three things. First, I felt that my friend Dave Jacobs is very bright to have figured all this out. Second, I was impressed that he had the guts to publish this, knowing that he will probably never be- come a full professor. But third I felt some intellectual uneasiness. This was not about the thesis itself, which I think is scary as all get- out (maybe this is a fourth feeling), but about the solidity of the conclusions. How did I know whether what I had just read was true? This is particularly important when Dave advances some eminently testable hypotheses. Somewhere in the book I remember reading that with each hybrid generation, the hybrids look more like hu-"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"Page 10 April 2001 MUFON UFO Journal mans. Plausible, but where was the data? There was no data. This was a pure speculation. But many of the as- sertions in the book are equally speculative. The whole book is a speculation, although based on a bedrock of fact. So while we have made very substantial progress in our knowledge of, say, abductions, that knowledge needs to be refined and checked in ways that we seem most reluctant to practice. We don't know until we can support what we believe with some tables or other statistical proofs. Conclusion And I feel that that is our problem. We have lots of raw data from which we have very strongly speculated. We need to check the inferences we have made. We need to marshall the genuine facts that we have in a more coherent and logical way. We need to connect up the stuff we are doing with mainstream science. If we are going to fulfill the promise of UFOlogy, we need to do more work to shore up the walls of our gothic cathedral. We have built high, but not carefully. And so here we are, on the heights that our speculations have opened to us. No wonder we sometimes feel insecure. We are insecure. An interesting comparison might be the psychoana- lysts. Originally successful at wooing intellectual opinion, the psychoanalysts isolated themselves in special insti- tutes, rather than concentrating on the universities. As a result, they eventually ended up talking mainly to them- selves (and their patients). They needed the critical tests of hypotheses that a university-based discipline would have brought them. Instead, psychoanalysis has had little major advance since the days of Freud. Psychoanalysis is now regarded as a kind of pop, or even pseudo, sci- ence. So we are way out in the blue. Not because what we believe is absurd-though no doubt many outsiders believe just that-but rather because we have not put together what we know to form a coherent and well-tested pic- ture. We, like Othello, have made a plausible chain of inferences. But how do we know they are the right ones? Kentucky MUFON newsletter editor Becky Sanders dies in home fire Rebecca (Becky) Sanders, 48, editor of Kentucky MUFON's newsletter, died in a fire at her home on Jan. 18. She is survived by her husband and a daughter. Known for her willingness to volunteer, her pursuit of the truth behind abductions, the driving force behind the newsletter, and her concern for those around her, Becky will be greatly missed. Condolences have poured in from around the nation from those who have been touched by this unique lady. Filer's Files By George A. Filer Director, MUFON Eastern Region Arthur Clarke sees life on Mars Arthur Clarke is known for spinning elaborate, vision- ary tales of futures that might be, none more famous than 2001: A Space Odyssey. But according to Clarke, the real 2001 has some pretty unbelievable things to offer. \"I'm fairly convinced that we have discovered life on Mars,\" Clarke told Spaceicom recently as Buzz Aldrin lis- tened. \"There are some in- credible photographs from [the Jet Propulsion Labora- tory] which to me are pretty convincing proof of the exist- ence of large forms of life on Mars! Have a look at them. I don't see any other interpre- tation.\" Thanks to Space.cdm: http://www.space.com/ peopleinterviews/ George Filer clarke_believe_010227.html Was UFO involved in crash of transport? MACON— John Thompson, an excellent UFO in- vestigator, sent me information from the Atlanta Jour- nal-Constitution, which reports that 21 National Guard personnel died in a farm field near this small Georgia town when a twin-engine turboprop transport plane crashed and burst into flames March 3,2001. The worst military aviation disaster in Georgia's history involved the very reliable C-23 Sherpa troop and cargo carrying aircraft. Witnesses said the plane appeared to come down slowly and almost glide before crashing in a muddy field. Dennis Posey a farmer, described the sound of the plane coming down as \"a scream.\" He heard a crash, jumped in his pickup truck, and drove a mile from his house, dis- covering a plane that was beyond hope. He described the fuselage of the Army transport plane as compacted. \"There was no way there was anybody left,\" he said. Posey said the plane apparently began to break apart before it crashed. A 4- or 5-foot piece of the tail section landed in a small pecan grove near the home of his father, D.E. Posey, about three-fourths of a mile from the crash site. A 20-foot section of the plane's left wing hit the ground about a quarter-mile from the pecan grove, closer to the crash site. Posey said there were no burn marks on either of those pieces or a half-dozen other pieces of the plane scattered in the area. Note: I have concerns that a UFO may have been involved in this crash. First, UFOs are frequently seen"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal April 2001 Page 11 flying at low level in the general area. Second, the Sherpa is a slow flying aircraft, and it is unlikely that both a wing and tail would have structural failure even if the craft had flown into bad weather. Third, similar crashes have oc- curred with unknown metals found on the tail structures and wings indicating a mid-air collision with an unidenti- fied craft. Fourth, the crew had no time to issue any warn- ing or May Day, indicating a collision of some type. Fifth, witnesses indicated there was no airborne explosion. I freely admit this is a remote possibility; however, it is time that all possibilities be considered in die tragic loss of life. UFOs are frequently sighted in the area of crashes. The extraordinary power and high speeds of UFOs may accidentally cause damage to our aircraft. Colorado cigar-shaped UFO reported MOFFAT — Christopher O'Brien reports, 'Tony,\" his wife and their young child were traveling east on County Rd T, on March 2, 2001, when they observed \"a small cigar-shaped UFO flying south toward Blanca Peak. The craft was the size of a Cessna plane. At first we thought it was a small plane but it didn't have a [vertical stabi- lizer] tail,\" and they noted it was \"traveling too slowly to be a conventional plane.\" The witnesses estimated the object was less than 1/4- mile away and was flying at an altitude of \"100 feet.\" The craft flew by the front of their car for about ten sec- onds when, to their surprise, \"it blinked out\" and disap- peared. \"We couldn't believe our eyes—it just vanished.\" The craft was \"dull silver\" in color and may have had \"stubby little wings\" extending out from the fuselage. At the time of their sighting there was no wind, and the sky was clear over the valley floor with some broken clouds over the Sangre de Cristo Mountains, which are located 15 miles to the east of the sighting location. They did not discern a cupola or cockpit or see any identifying markings, nor was there any sound. Seconds after the fly-by 'Tony,\" who is normally quiet and low-key, excit- edly called Chris on his cell phone to file their sighting report. Thanks to Christopher O'Brien, author of The Mysterious Valley (St Martins Press) Maccabee notes 1949 sighting ROGUE RIVER — Dr. Bruce Maccabee writes, \"In Filer's Files #9 you wrote: \"In one of the best reports I've received recently, a former SR-71 Air Force crew chief phoned to tell me he and his family of four had witnessed a disc-shaped UFO outside their home around 8:30 PM on both Feb. 21, and 22,2001. It started when he noticed a bright light at the top of the mountain behind his home. The mention of Rogue River caught my attention be- cause one of the most credible sightings of all time oc- curred there in May, 1949. The story is told in Chapter 10 of my book, The UFO-FBI Connection. \"Very briefly, a pancake-shaped object with a single small vertical fin was observed by three men and two women while they were in a fishing boat on the Rogue River near Gold Beach, OR. It was late afternoon on a clear day, May 24, while they were scanning the river looking for fish jumping that they noticed the object ap- proaching from the northeast. It stopped moving and hov- ered about east of their location for several minutes. \"During this time two of the men, who were employ- ees of the Ames Research Laboratory near San Fran- cisco, were able to look through 8X binoculars, each man having about a minute of viewing time. To the naked eye it looked like a coin seen obliquely, but in the binoculars it resolved to a thick pancake shape, and the surface looked 'wrinkled and dirty.' It should be obvious that under such excellent viewing conditions any ordinary aircraft shape or balloon shape would have been clearly obvious (if you can see an object well enough to see surface details you can certainly see the overall shape). \"While one of the men was watching, this object ro- tated on its vertical axis and then accelerated away to the southeast. They estimated that it achieved the speed of a jet in a few seconds, all with no noise. What sets this sighting apart from other 'run of the mill,' multiple wit- ness, daylight sightings under optimum viewing conditions is what happened.... or didn't happen afterward. \"The witnesses did not tell the local paper, radio or TV. In fact there is no evidence they told anyone EXCEPT the security office at Ames Research Laboratory. Their report began an investigation into the sighting by officers of the Air Force Office of Special Investigation. The in- vestigation involved interviews with all the witnesses, and interviews with acquaintances of the Ames employees. The investigation showed that the witnesses were cred- ible and probably very accurate in their report. \"The specific description of the shape and dynamics of the object make it clear that this is either the \"real thing\".... a flying saucer/craft not made by humans or a hoax. But I reject the hoax explanation because anyone who has a job that requires a security clearance, as at Ames Research Laboratory, will not (unless he is totally crazy) try to hoax the security office where he works. \"This case is listed as one of the 12 best unknown sightings between 1947 and 1952 by the Battelle Memo- rial Institute in the so-called Special Report #14 of Project Blue Book. There are further details and the results of my own investigation presented in the UFO/FBI book. The book can be purchased on-line at Amazon or Barnes and Noble and is in bookstores, published by Llewellyn in May, 2000.\" Thanks to Bruce Maccabee.

Three dish-shaped objects in Massachusetts BECKET - Peter Davenport is filing this report on behalf of four eye witnesses who observed three dish- shaped crafts with lights. This report is reflecting what the caller stated: Three dish shaped disks with lights were noticed through a picture window on Feb. 27,2001. The color of the lights started as white, then changed to red. They were hover- ing over a pond and chasing each other in the sky. The police were notified and came to the scene, just as the crafts left. The officer stated he did not see the crafts. However the caller stated that she saw the officer turn off his lights and back up on the road near her driveway near the pond, so it is likely he saw them. The caller stated that she saw these crafts on other occasions. Thanks to <A HREF=\"http://www.UFOcenter.com/\">National Reporting Center</A> www.ufocenter.com. Triangles reported over Chicago CHICAGO —Hank Spranza writes, \"Did anyone see the three triangle-shaped objects in the sky over Chicago on Sunday, March 4,2001 ? They went over the center of the city, flying from east to west at high altitude at about 12:05 AM. They were displaying light orange lights, looked to be large objects traveling at a high rate of speed at what appeared to be a very high altitude and created zero noise. \"My hobby is astronomy, and I'm very familiar with the night sky, and this is the first time I've seen anything like this in the twenty or so years that I' ve been observing the Chicago area sky.

Egg-shaped object in Washington PUYALLUP — The witness says, \"I would like to start-out by saying that I am an expert on aircraft and flying, and can honestly say that this object was not an aircraft, helicopter, or meteor, or any other man-made object. On March 2, 2001, my two friends and I were driving north on Highway 161 near Puyallup when we saw a bronze-colored object fly overhead at an elevation of about 5500 feet above sea level at 8:24 PM. The ob- ject was traveling at a very high rate of speed, around 700-750 mph, but showed no signs of it's propulsion sys- tem such as an afterburner flames, exhaust, etc. \"I could detect no noise being emitted from the object either. Aircraft that fly that fast are most often VERY loud at low elevations. We followed it until it disappeared from sight 65 miles away. It followed a straight path and did not change altitude or speed. The object \"blinked-out\" at about 70 miles away. \"One interesting piece of information is that it flew directly through the upwind leg of the landing pattern of Seatac Airport at a very dangerous altitude, violating FAA regulations. It most likely violated the airspace of McChord AFB also. The AM radio in my car had slightly more static during the time when the object was over- head.

Dozens reportedly see object in Honduras THE LA TIGRA NATIONAL PARK — La Tribuna News, March 9,2001, — Dozens of persons reportedly saw on March 8 an object over the Honduran capital. It was around 11:30 a.m. with the sun very bright when an oval, unknown object, grey in color and occasionally vi- brating with intense whiteness, appeared over a region of the city's periphery on a contrail which seemed to come from the \"Cristo de El Picacho\" area. Two telephone technicians, Gerardo Aceituno and Juan Mairena, described the sighting as \"the experience of our lives,\" noting that the object was perhaps searching for a power source (since some 400 meters down the road, there is an electrical substation). The UFO was at an estimated altitude of 300 meters. Similarly surprised were college student Ivan Flores and amateur photographer Juan Carlos Molina, who man- aged to snap photographs of the two different UFOs, near Cristo del Picacho and La Tigra. \"Upon looking ahead, we saw something moving back and forth, up and down, some 300 meters up. We clearly saw it was a flying saucer,\" states Gerardo Aceituno. \"We stopped the car and saw that the UFO was grey, oval and with a whitish intensity, and while it was far away, it could have easily measured some five meters in diameter.\" Juan Francsico Mairena corroborated the three- minute event. A row of 20 cars formed, and their occupants stared at the UFO's erratic movements in sheer amazement be- fore it vanished southward with stunning swiftness. \"It's velocity was amazing, perhaps faster than sound.

Numerous officers in Georgia have. The UFO phenomenon in its present form has been with us now for about 50 years. If you have never read any of the serious literature regarding this enigma, or probed deeper into the many hundreds of reports received by legitimate UFO research organizations each year, you might think that anyone reporting a UFO is a wild-eyed lunatic who has forgotten to take his or her medication and regularly communicates with the Supreme Commandant's Starship at Ashlar Command! Many of you may be unaware that Governor Jimmy Carter, along with ten members of the Leary Lions Club, reported a UFO encounter in 1969, or that Astronaut Gordon Cooper had two highly unusual UFO encounters, one of which was filmed by part of his ground crew dur- ing his test pilot days. (Cooper has also briefed a U.N. committee on these events). Additionally, lunar astronaut Dr. Edgar Mitchell, the sixth man to walk on the moon, now has his own scien- tific group and writes and speaks nationally on the reality of the UFO phenomenon. How about Dr. J. Allen Hynek, professor of astronomy at Northwestern University? Dr. Hynek was hired by the Air Force to \"debunk\" UFO reports for Project Bluebook and did so for many years. He was so deeply involved in this that he made a discovery that UFOs are a REAL phenomenon! After his service as a USAF and Blue Book expert, Dr. Hynek founded the Center for UFO Studies (CUFOS), which today remains one of the most respected scientific organizations in the field of UFO investigation and research. (I understand the USAF was pretty steamed about that!) UFO cases definitely deserve scrutiny by the scien- tific community. I could go on and on listing the number of respected scientific persons, military pilots, airline pilots, law enforcement officers, and other trained observers who have had dramatic encounters with UFOs. Most of this Editor's Note This article by MUFON Georgia (MUFONGA) Di- rector Tom Sheets appeared in the December 2000 issue of The Georgia Peace Officer, the Official Publication for the Peace Officers Association of Georgia. Tom, as noted in the article, has a background in law enforcement, and this gives him a definite advantage in having an article like this included in an official publica- tion. However, it is probably possible for any state direc- tor to write such an article for his/her state law enforce- ment publication if the approach is right. Study this article, noting the approach and the refer- ences. I'm sure Tom would also give you permission to quote him in your article, and this would provide a valu- able tie to law enforcement. Quoting a law official in your own state would also be beneficial. If anyone would want assistance in polishing an article prior to submission for publication, I would be glad to help. A piece such as this gives the MUFON organization and personnel credibility, exposure, and valuable contacts. Give it a try. information is available for all in the various reliable UFO literature, and only a few accurate UFO Web sites. As you probably well know, this field also has its hoax- ers, con men, cranks, and weirdos, as does much of our present-day society. Some researchers and authors who publish in this field write pure \"pap\" and exaggerated claims just to sell books, just as many similar individuals set up horribly inaccurate and exploitive UFO web sites. One must be very particular about these information sources. More on this later. The world's largest international UFO investigation and research group is the Mutual UFO Network (MUFON), founded in 1969. MUFON is a nonprofit corporation with chapters in all 50 states, Canada, and numerous overseas countries. MUFON is governed by a board of directors, with the assistance of a scientific board representing 46 areas of science and technology, including astronomy, physics, biology, aeronautics, engineering, theology, medi- cal science, and so forth. The newly appointed international director of MUFON is John Schuessler, a retired aerospace engineering ex- ecutive from McDonnell-Douglas. John is one of the founding MUFON members. You can see some of his achievements orbiting the earth; John played a key role in the design of the NASA environmental systems in the various space shuttles and the new International Space Station, which is now orbiting, mostly complete and occu- pied as of this writing. Locally, MUFON of Georgia (MUFONGA) has more than 60 members scattered around the state, with most centered in the Atlanta, central, and north Georgia areas."},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"Page 14 April 2001 MUFON UFO Journal Twelve of these members are trained and certified field investigators who investigate reports and assist in the role of FTO for our investigator trainees. MUFON investigators must undergo extensive study, OJT, and a fairly difficult certification exam in order to earn their full credentials. MUFON operations and other procedures are governed by a 311 -page Investigator's Manual that rivals the SOP books of many police departments. Georgia training classes and general public meetings are held two to three times a year, as are sky watches (stakeouts!) and smaller person- nel meetings. MUFONGA also publishes a quarterly newsletter for members (Georgia Sky Watch) and has an online bulle- tin via email that works much like the NLETS to keep our members and supporters aware of UFO activity around the state. We have adopted various law enforcement ap- proaches and techniques into our methods here at MUFONGA, and other chapters are following suit. Most of you in south and east Georgia are not aware of my background. I spent 25 years in law enforcement at the police department in College Park, Georgia, home of Atlanta's Hartsfield Airport. Fourteen of those years were spent as a detective, CID commander, forensic hyp- notist and firearms instructor. In the final nine years I was chief of police in College Park. I retired in Decem- ber of 1995. I began this pursuit of the UFO enigma after a per- sonal encounter in the mid 1960s and was only interrupted briefly by service in the Marine Corps and South Vietnam from 1967 to 1970. Law enforcement provided me addi- tional opportunities to work with others on this same path, and retirement has allowed an even deeper involvement as state director of MUFONGA. This involvement has also led to several other UFO encounters while conduct- ing investigations all over Georgia since 1996. We are particularly proud of the quality of our MUFONGA staff. My two state director predecessors both have scientific backgrounds. Chris Early of Atlanta is a retired scientist who designed rocket components for Werner Von Braun's teams during the space race, and John Thompson of Lagrange has a geology and petro- leum exploration background. Our current MUFONGA historian (and an investiga- tor) is Michael D. Hitt, a veteran officer with the Roswell, Georgia, Police Department. Michael has recently pub- lished Georgia's Aerial Phenomena, 1947-1987, a book detailing almost 200 reported Georgia sightings, many from pilots, law enforcement officers, reporters, and military personnel. The research for this book took three years, during which Michael began to develop some interesting theories regarding UFO activity as related to law enforce- ment and world conflict. MUFONGA's chief science advisor in Georgia is Ralph 0. Howard Jr., a government geologist. Our ranks also include both active and retired professional educators, former aerospace employees, and members of the com- puter science and communications professions, as well as homemakers and professionals from other fields. MUFONGA's recently appointed deputy director for South Georgia is John E. Bodin, Sr., of Wray. Many of you know John as marketing director for Georgia Peace Officer magazine, and, knowing that, realize that the South Geor- gia UFO situation is in capable hands. Another aspect of the UFO phenomenon in Georgia surprises many people. During a 10 or 12-year period, roughly from the mid-1980s through about 1997, Georgia had one of the highest numbers of reported UFO cases in the United States. A lot of this occurred in what research- ers now call the \"Troup-Heard UFO Corridor,\" which is centered on Lagrange and West Point Lake. (Other ar- eas of high activity are the Chatsworth-Elijay-Blue Ridge vicinity and the Moultrie-Douglas-Valdosta area). Of course, the vast majority of reports received by MUFON and the few other legitimate groups are not UFOs at all, but misidentified aircraft/test aircraft, celes- tial bodies viewed under unusual atmospheric conditions, a few weather balloons, satellites, meteors, returning space junk, some other unusual natural phenomena, or just plain hoaxes. When our investigators begin an inquiry, we automati- cally assume that one of the above mundane causes is behind the report, and our investigative process can some- times establish one of these routine events as the cause. If the above things are eliminated as the cause, or the conduct of the object observed is far beyond our compre- hension of what is normal and possible, only then do we begin to suspect an anomalous event... a true UFO. I can state without hesitation that even after the pro- saic events are ruled out, there is an astonishing number of truly inexplicable events occurring in our skies. Debate has raged for years on the percentage of UFO reports that are proven to be misunderstood routine aerial occur- rences, as opposed to the true unknowns, or UFOs. Some researchers say 90 percent versus 10 percent, others 95 percent versus 5 percent. Personally, I think it's some- thing like 90 percent versus 10 percent. Even at 95/5, this still gives us too many unexplained objects in our skies, objects that can make 90-degree turns at several thousand miles per hour without slowing, ob- jects completely reversing course at similar speeds, ob- jects observed doing the same on radar with simultaneous ground observation, objects hovering and then going thou- sands of miles per hour instantly, objects that routinely outrun our fastest jet fighters, objects doing all of the above, up close and personal in plain view of airline pilots, pilots, sea captains, law enforcement officers, and not just a few scientists. (Many scientists will not admit to what they have seen. Of those who do, they sometimes discreetly contact or"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal April 2001 Page 15 join MUFON, or CUFOS, or seek more information very quietly. Others with more fortitiude, like Professors Hynek, Sturrock, and Dr. Mitchell, actively join the search for answers, as did Sen. Barry Goldwater. A law enforcement officer's first priority is to protect and serve the public, by way of their sheriff's or chief's policies and by closely following their oath of office. More plainly put... gotta keep the burglars and robbers from toting off the town, the DUIs from slaughtering other driv- ers, and the dopers from plying their trade. That's a tall order, even if the FBI statisticians say crime is down (don't tell a carjacking victim about these lower statistics!). Officers just don't have a whole lot of time to devote to even the occasional call regarding suspected UFOs. This is where MUFON of Georgia can help your agency. Undoubtably you will respond to a citizen's initial call, but upon finding no real problem, perhaps only a report of hovering lights or objects, your citizen call can be referred to MUFONGA. We can establish contact and make a pre-assessment as to whether a full investigation by our personnel is necessary (many times we are able to quickly determine a routine cause for what occurred, or that noth- ing further can be done). Sometimes a witness may be so upset and shocked that they will demand answers. This is where we have a certain expertise. We can get your agency \"off of the hook\" so to speak, freeing up your personnel to chase crooks, and leaving the citizen/witness feeling good about the professionalism of your personnel and your depart- ment. MUFONGA will later provide your agency with a report of our findings. These referrals can be made in several ways. The re- sponding officer can provide MUFONGA's contact infor- mation to the citizen (our telephone number or e-mail ad- dress), or the officer can ask permission from the com- plainant to later forward the data and their personal con- tact information to MUFONGA or even have the 911 per- sonnel make the call as soon as is practical. . MUFON of Georgia can be contacted in the following ways. [Listings not included in this reprint.] The national MUFON headquarters now maintains a new and upgraded Web site that has a reporting area for UFOs. Citizens can now go online to MUFON and report their experience. This information will then be forwarded to our Georgia headquarters for further disposition.

In closing, let me say that law enforcement officers are subject to witnessing a number of these events while on patrol. We welcome your reports in such cases. One of the most famous UFO landing cases involved a Socorro, New Mexico, police officer in 1964-the Lonnie Zamora This New Mexico-related art is one of the U-Haul state-related drawings appearing on U-Haul ve- hicles. Reports indicate that the newest one ob- served depicts Area 51 for Nevada. case. More recently, on Jan. 5,2000, officers from sev- eral Dlinois towns near Saint Louis (Lebanon, Millstadt, Dupo, and Highland) tracked a large low and slow-mov- ing UFO both visually and by patrol car, keeping in radio contact all the while. This dramatic event is recounted in the March 2000 MUFON UFO Journal, a monthly pe- riodical which is sent to all MUFON members. Numer- ous other cases involving law enforcement officers are also on file at MUFON headquarters. Finally, for further research, I will provide any Geor- gia law enforcement officer with a reference list of the best books regarding the UFO phenomena, and the Web addresses of the reputable and reliable UFO web sites. These are the same books and Web sites we use daily and recommend to our field investigators. I will also add any Georgia officers having e-mail to our online UFO intel bulletin so that they receive the same information as do our MUFONGA personnel. (This can also be done for your agency's \"official\" e-mail address if requested by the department head). I can also provide the back issues of our online bulletin to bring you up to date on Georgia activity for the past three years. Just contact me as described above. We also welcome the membership of any officers, deputies, firefighters, EMTs, support personnel, and oth- ers within the public safety community. Those who may be interested in Officer Michael D.

I have rarely failed to be thoroughly engrossed by them. In the US, of course, MUFON hosts impressive events every year, and in the UK there is at least one, usually two or three, such get-togethers that are organised by the equivalent national group (BUFORA), various regional groups, or UFO magazine. These enjoyable weekends afford the opportunity to meet and hear speakers that one might have only read about in a magazine such as this one. Or indeed to simply mix with like-thinking researchers and share ideas or swap theories. Conferences have a vital social function but also serve the important purpose of promoting a group, earning it new members and subscribers. They can also be justified as a way to showcase to the general public-especially via the publicity that they tend to generate-what serious UFOlogy is up to. So I am certainly not opposed to the regular flow of such events, and agree to lecture at them whenever I can. The next phase? However, the standard type of UFO conference has limitations that we have been discussing in the UK re- cently. What we have been trying to do is find a way to move forward to the next phase-to organise a type of conference that is designed differently and has a con- trasting purpose to the majority of such events. By this I mean a conference that is not aimed at the enthusiast or person who walks in off the street to hear what UFOlogy is all about. Typical conferences tend to have to cater for this kind of drive-by audience, and thus undersell the opportunity to further the subject by maximising the fortune of having so many serious UFO researchers together in one place at one time. UFOlogy has had too few of the scientific styled events that are common in professional subjects where a set agenda is created and working specialists in that field come together with the specific intention of furthering the quest for answers in a narrowly defined goal. This is by no means easy, of course, because it comes up against the major problem that UFOlogy tends to have- lack of money. How can you organise an international conference that is not designed to attract hundreds of paying customers through the door? Thats the debate we are having in our efforts to find a way that can create a working conference agenda that will be more than just a talking shop. It will actually set out to achieve something. Money, money ,money Of course, there is a way to do this. You can find a rich philanthropist-a UFO enthusiast who happens to have millions of dollars-to come up with a whopping subsidy that will help bring together the kind of people that will make a working conference buzz. That is what happened in 1992 when over 100 UFOlogists, abductees and other researchers met for a week at MIT to discuss the abduc- tion phenomenon and find ways to take this field forward. It was possibly the most scientifically structured con- ference ever put together. It certainly was an event that I will never forget. I felt priviliged to be invited to MTT, and I gained enormously from the structured nature of the agenda and the debate. But this was a one-off event. It happened as it did only because a hefty sum of money was donated to make it happen. If the event had been set up so that those invited had to pay their own way to get to Boston, let alone to stay there for a week and then to pay a share of the costs of hiring the facilities needed to stage the event, I cer- tainly could not have afforded this. And I suspect a large percentage of the UFO commu- nity would have been priced out as well. This seems to put a bar on ever holding this kind of symposium on any- thing like a regular basis, because there simply are too few super rich enthusiasts willing to sponsor such ven- tures, and only a handful of moderately rich UFOlogists who could afford to jet set around the globe and attend a pay-for-yourself type of conference, unless it fortuitously gets set up in their own country or region. British conferences Recognising this problem does not mean that more parochial conferences of this type could not be set up, even recognising that they are likely to be restrictive in the audience that they can attract. Indeed in the UK we have staged several such events already to test the wa- ter. In the early 1980s, for example, a plan was conceived to create a \"code of practice,\" a working set of self im- posed ethics dictating to the UFOlogist how to interact with witnesses, the media, the authorities and one an- other. This was devised as a way to send a signal to those outside the British UFO community that we were trying to act like responsible people by generating what was in"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal April 2001 Page 17 effect our own Hippocratic oath. In order to make this work a few of us who wanted to push the concept forward put our own money into travel- ling the country and setting up a series of local meetings. These were staged in various major cities (such as Nottingham and Swindon), and were not advertised as public events with showcase speakers, but as working events aimed to gather ideas for the code. A local group sponsored and organised the events. We split the costs between everyone who attended (so if 20 turned up on the day and the facilities cost $100 to book, then each person was asked to pay $5 to cover this). And this meant that everybody who was there came with the intention of working on the project, not to sit back and let others speak. This year of local conferences was used to forge the Code of Practice, and this was then taken in outline form to the next available national conference (a BUFORA event in London) so as to formally ratify and announce to the world this cummulative effort involving much of Brit- ish UFOlogy working as a team. At least this experience proved what could be done! The Code of Practice is still a success. It has been upgraded and adapted as years have gone by, and is now mandatory as a means of membership into Britain's pre- mier UFO group, BUFORA, as well as to organisations as diverse as the small team of high calibre experienced case investigators known as UFOIN and the paranormal research team ASSAP. So even 20 years later this project that was created by different UFO groups working together as a team dem- onstrates the value of a working conference. A different kind of event A different kind of event was set up by BUFORA in the summer of 1986 to discuss the then embryonic crop circle mystery. We made this a day in which every party involved in the field at that time was given the opportunity to make their case. Those favoring hoaxes were given the chance to prove their point, as were the supporters of weather effects and of various more exotic forces. This fascinating gathering came before the widespread media interest, several years before the book Circular Evidence created a global furore, and for the first (and I suspect last!) time brought together on one platform all the major players in the early years of crop circle re- search, including Colin Andrews, Pat Delgado, Dr. Terence Meaden, and Paul Fuller. At the end of the day the audience (mostly comprising UFOlogists) voted on what they considered to be the most fruitful areas that had emerged for future research. Hoax- ing and weather effects gained the most support, which was certainly a surprise to me. A not dissimilar venture was attempted by BUFORA in December, 1983, when Brenda Butler and Dot Street put their case for a major UFO event having occurred at Rendlesham Forest, and science journalist Ian Ridpath countered their claims with a first presentation of his then brand new lighthouse theory-which has been the main claim of skeptics about this case ever since. I found this style of case debating very illuminating, as it was done in a civilised manner and opened up plenty of areas of conflict that needed to be resolved. I would cer- tainly like to see this : kind of feature extended at even standard types of UFO conference where disparate views on one event or type of UFO phenomenon could be prof- itably debated. A 21st century conference However, what we really want to do in Britain now is to find a type of conference that builds on the positive direction suggested by MIT-an event that takes one very specific type of UFO question and brings together every conceivable contribution that might add something useful into the discussion. Take, for instance, car stop cases. There are several hundred of these seemingly very consistent phenomena within the UFO data base, but we are still less than clear how or why they occur. In the UK of late some UFOlogists are even challenging the idea that they really happen at all. This strange idea stems from a reinvestigation of a classic car stop case during the British wave in October/ November 1967. What has long thought to be an impor- tant event often debated by UFOlogists has begun to crumble under intense scrutiny, causing these people to ask if other car stops might be vulnerable to in depth in- vestigation. However, if we were to stage a conference exclu- sively devoted to this type of case, then we should make a serious attempt to answer not just this, but also many other related questions. For example, we would define up front the ten most important things that need resolving, arrange the event up to a year ahead and set the challenge to researchers to come up with the data to help resolve these issues. This they can do through reinvestigating key cases, conduct- ing statistical analyses, performing experiments, soliciting the views of outside experts, or whatever it takes. Then those who want to present their results at the conference can make this fact known a few weeks in advance and give an idea of the nature of their presenta- tion. The timetable of a structured debate built around the questions that are being posed about the phenomenon can then be produced. This will allow a thorough assessment of the topic. Another way in which this kind of conference can be taken beyond the normal pattern of UFO meetings is by inviting contributions from outside sources. In this instance the ten questions could, for instance, be posted in car me- chanics journals, onto physics web sites, and so on, invit- ing participation in both the research phase and the pre-"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"Page 18 April 2001 MUFON UFO Journal sentation at the conference, thus involving people who may never have considered attending a UFO related event. There are moves in the UK to get a conference of this type off the ground, if nothing else as an experiment to test the water. For there are, of course, any number of specific topics within the UFO field that could benefit from this kind of approach-in effect a structured working bee leading to a full scale conference. Photographic evi- dence. Radar-visual cases. Landing traces. The list is end- less. Hopefully, if this kind of project can be successfully carried out in the UK, then it will prove a model for others to follow. For there is no reason that many conferences of this kind cannot be organised all over the world. They may provide a boost that the rather moribund UFO re- search community needs. MUFON FORUM Letters to Mufon UFO Journal Greetings, Dwight, I have today received the January issue of the MUFON UFO Journal and note that you have included an article on page 3 regarding Majestic 12 (MJ-12) which I had sent in. Many thanks for having included the crediting of myself for having submitted the article. There is one small update to this. Paul Thompson did raise the question of Code Names including \"Anvil\" (this paragraph is on page 4 of the Journal about the middle of the left hand column) He raises the point, \"It would be interesting to research the archives to see if the code name Majestic was allocated to any operation in World War 2.\" The update is this: the secret code word for the pro- posed invasion of Japan (plans created prior to the use of the atomic bombs) was \"Olympic.\" I have obtained through Jan Aldrich a \"Top Secret\" Incoming Classified Message (now declassified) dated 7th August 1946, in which CINCAFPAC Tokyo sought clarification regard- ing code word \"Olympic\" and code word \"majestic.\" The body of the Aug. 7 message to WDGPO says, \"In your radio WX 79139 of 28 October 1945, operational plan 'Olympic' was reduced in classification to restricted with certain excepted portions. In view of the JCS radio WX 47190 of 10th August, 1945, which cancelled the word 'Olympic' and substituted code word 'majestic,' was it the intention of first cited radio to also reduce classifi- cation of the code word 'majestic' to restricted.\" On 8 August 1946, WDGPO replied, \"Both code words referred to your C 63884 were declassified by JCS 8 Oc- tober 1945.\" Regards, Murray Bott, New Zealand Director for MUFON. The UFO Evidence, Volume II, a Thirty-Year Re- port, by Richard H. Hall, 2001, 784 pages, hard- cover; Scarecrow Press, Inc., 4720 Boston Way, Lanham, MD 20706, 1-800-462-6420, www.scarecrowpress.com, $59.95 ($47.96 to MUFON members directly from Scarecrow Press). Reviewed by Dwight Connelly This is another of the classics of UFO literature, and no serious ufologist should be without it. Hall is one of the most respected ufologists of the past fifty years, and his extensive research and in- volvement in UFO organiza- tions give him a definite edge in bringing together material which constitutes The UFO Evidence, Vol. II, compiled over the thirty-one years (1964-1994) covered in this volume. The forerunner of this book. The UFO Evidence (which constitutes Volume I), also written by Hall, was pub- lished in 1964 in soft cover by the National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena (NICAP), and covered the 1947-1963 period. The current book is a 681-page hardback, constructed to withstand many years of handling by researchers. Quite interesting is the Master Chronology which precedes the main part of the book. This lists key dates, including both dates of sightings and dates of other events of interest to ufologists, beginning with \"pre-1964\" and continuing year by year through 1995. While these entries note the sec- tion of the book where the case is located, the specific page numbers are not listed. The 486 entries in the Master Chronology average nearly 16 per year for the 31-year 1965-1995 period, but there are wide variations in activity. For example, the 1965-67 period averages nearly 43 entries per year, while the 1983-85 period averages fewer than 4. The final four years, 1991 -94, average only 7 entries per year. One of the unique features of this book is the use of italics when characteristic descriptions of UFOs and en- counters are given. This should prove helpful to those initially less knowledgeable, but also serves to emphasize these characteristics for veteran ufologists. Hall begins the main part of his report with a section called \"Overview and Guide to Other Sections\" in which he asks and answers such questions as \"Have UFO Sightings in Recent Decades Confirmed Earlier Pat-"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal April 2001 Page 19 terns?,\" \"Do Experienced Observers Still Report UFOs?,\" and \"Have UFO Sightings Continued in Other Countries?\" This is an excellent introduction for those with only lim- ited knowledge of ufology, and a good review for veter- ans. Each section is well documented with numerous foot- notes. There is an extensive bibliography of perhaps 300 general books/pamphlets/articles on ufology, another 33 entries related to occupant cases, and more than a hun- dred additional entries related to abductions. This is one of the best UFO bibliographies available anywhere. The UFO Evidence features numerous drawings and photos, which add a great deal to the descriptions of spe- cific cases and individuals. Along with the many positive points is one shortcom- ing which, unfortunately, is all too common in UFO books- an inadequate index. The researcher looking for a spe- cific case is pretty much out of luck if time is a factor, since the brief index deals with such items as \"Federal Aviation Administration,\" \"implication of ET visitors,\" and \"shapes,\" but no cases. Another oversight is the fact that each page in each section contains the name of the section at the top, but no number for that section—yet the numerous cross refer- ences, as well as the Master Chronology, use the section numbers and not the titles. There is an interesting section of the index which lists cases according to geographical locations, such as state or country, and this is a nice feature for those seeking information about a specific area. Hall makes his case for UFO evidence mainly through quantity, looking at the sheer volume of reports having key similarities and credible witnesses. In general, he does not emphasize the few exceptional cases, such as the Travis Walton abduction or the Delphos, Kansas, ground traces, though both are included. He does, how- ever, discuss the Roswell case in some detail. In compiling evidence for UFOs, Hall divides the book into sections: Military Witnesses; Pilot and Aircrew Sightings; Scientists and Technicians; Police Officers; Professionals and Citizens; Special Evidence; Sighting Waves and Concentrations; Structure, Lights, and Col- ors; Motions and Flight Patterns, The UFO Profile, Alien- Human Encounters, The Abduction Phenomenon, Roswell and Other Crash Retrievals, Historical Developments, and Implications and Issues. In dealing with cases by topic it must have been some- what difficult for Hall to to know where to place them. Is the sighting of an object by a policeman who experiences physiological effects and notes a very erratic pattern of flight going to appear in \"Police Officers,\" \"Special Evi- dence,\" or \"Colors, Motions, and Flight Patterns\"? For- tunately, there is extensive cross referencing (but without page numbers). Hall makes occasional use of the expertise of other researchers, such as Walter M. Webb and Don Berliner, and the section on \"The Abduction Phenomenon\" includes a 16-page essay by Dr. Thomas E. Bullard on \"Emer- gence of the UFO Abduction Phenomenon,\" which pro- vides the following nicely-balanced view: \"What 30 years of abduction research has established can be declared in a few lines: Thousands of people re- port abduction experiences; most of them are normal to all appearances, and many of them are capable individu- als leading respectable lives who stand to gain little and lose much by public declaration of this claim. The stories describe a coherent phenomenon, not the individualistic adventures of fantasizers, hoaxers, or delusions. In fact, the stories converge toward a unity that is remarkable, given the variety of cultural influences available. The simi- larities from narrator to narrator, and sometimes multiple witnesses confirming the same encounter, are important characteristics of an objective phenomenon.\" Hall's own views, of course, influence what is included in this book and the amount of emphasis given. He intro- duces the section on \"Roswell and Other Crash Retriev- als\" in the following manner: \"Evidence in support of the claim that UFOs have crashed (and have thereby be- come IFOs-identified flying objects) remains largely an- ecdotal, and without strong independent documentation. Although there is no conclusive evidence, there is some historical evidence, some partial documentation, and some intriguing sworn testimony. Collectively, this provides ample reason to continue gathering more complete evi- dence before passing judgment.\" Hall follows with an interesting listing of possible crashes and retrievals, and an essay on Roswell by him and Don Berliner. In discussing the implications and is- sues of the UFO phenomenon, Hall notes that \"few seri- ous students of UFO history doubt that the U.S. Govern- ment has withheld important information about UFOs. This can be documented to a certain degree.\" This is an impressive book, well worth the high list price, and an especially good buy at the discounted price for MUFON members.

It is difficult to read this account and believe that the sightings by U.S. military personnel were the result of imagination, hoaxing, or the nearby light- house-a popular explanation by skeptics such as journal- ist Ian Ridpath. Whether it is \"Britain's Roswell,\" as sug- gested on the title page, is another matter. Those who peruse the Internet know that considerable controversy has been gener- ated by the book, chiefly in- volving Jenny Randies, who has also researched Rendlesham, and more re- cently Larry Warren, one of the alleged witnesses. Randies reviewed the book for the Fortean Times, and Bruni objected to the re- view, initiating an extensive exchange between those two and others on the Internet. Warren, the author of Left at East Gate (his own story of the Rendlesham Forest case), objected to Bruni's depiction of him. He initiated his own Internet debate with the author, challenging Bruni with a series of disjointed questions-which she answered rather convincingly. All of this has undoubtedly helped sales for the book, which has already gone through several printings and has passed the 6,000 mark in sales at a time when UFO books are not selling especially well. Bruni has been quite willing to publicly take on all challengers, and her exten- sive research and the presentation of compelling details have served her well as she defends her presentation. Thus the debates have also served to clarify the various viewpoints. One question raised by critics is whether the title of the book, which is based on a statement reportedly made by former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher when Bruni asked her about UFOs, is an accurate indication of Mrs. Thatcher's views. This we may never know, but to Bruni's credit she does describe the circumstances in which Mrs. Thatcher made the remark. One gets the impression in reading You Can't Tell the People that Bruni has made a sincere effort to \"tell it as it is,\" pointing out the various contradictions in the testi- mony and evidence, while concluding that something out of the ordinary did occur. She provides a great deal of background information to the sightings, which allows the reader unfamiliar with the military, the geographical area, and the testimony to put people and events in perspec- tive. The book is logically organized, and includes a decent index-something which is often frustratingly absent in UFO books. There is considerable merit in digging into a specific case, since the many details can be adequately covered, just as there is merit in comparing many cases to examine common elements. This UK event is significant not be- cause of any great new information about UFOs, but be- cause of the documented involvement of U.S. Air Force personnel. As such, it takes its place as one of the sev- eral important UFO cases, and Bruni's impressive efforts to dig out. the facts must stand as the best presentation thus far of what occurred in Rendlesham Forest a score of years ago.

Editor's Note: The following is presented as in- formation for Journal readers, and is not an endorse- ment of any opinion as to what was actually occur- ring. To some it is strictly comedy, and to others it is disclosure disguised as comedy. On March 6, former astronaut and senator John Glenn appeared on the sitcom Frasier and gave the following soliloquy: \"Back in those glory days, I was very uncomfortable when they asked us to say things that I didn't want to say, and deny other things. Some people asked, you know, 'Were you alone out there?' We never gave the real an- swer. We've seen things out there, strange things. But we know what we saw out there. And we couldn't really say anything; the bosses were scared of this. They were afraid of 'War of the Worlds' type stuff, about panic in the streets. And so we had to keep quiet. And now we only see these things in our nightmares or maybe in the movies.

Hall I have been viewing the recent \"revival\" of George Adamski with consternation, since this is one \"contactee\" that was conclusively proven to be a fraud during the NICAP years. Somehow the overwhelming case against him has become lost in the mists of time. Research and investigation by NICAP personnel, in- cluding myself, established clearly that the man was a pre- varicator and would-be cult leader whose shenanigans set back serious UFO research. Here are a few of the high- lights: (1) Adamski wrote a fiction book in 1949 (well before his first alleged \"Venusian\" contact in the desert) entitled Pioneers of Space: a Trip to the Moon, Mars and Venus describing Venusians who were proficient in mental telepathy, \"ethereal\" women and \"radiant\" men, and a religious hierarchy of noble beings who inhabit the planets. All of this and much more reappears as alleged fact in his 1952 book NICAP conducted a passage by passage comparison of statements in the fiction book with Adamski's later allegedly factual books, leaving no doubt whatsoever that he had converted his own science fiction into claims of real events. I found the book in the Library of Congress, along with the following. (2) In 1936 Adamski wrote an esoteric book Wisdom of the Masters of the Far East (Call No. BP 600,R6) that shows his past association with the \"Royal Order of Tibet.\" It espouses an oriental mystical religion, which is exactly what his later alleged factual spacemen do as they sojourn through space. (3) NICAP analyzed the content of Flying Saucers Have Landed, Inside the Spaceships, and Flying Sau- cers Farewell and found numerous contradictions about who the spacemen were, where they came from, and what they were doing. In other words, Adamski (or his spacemen) could not tell a consistent story over the years. Probably the promoters of his cult never figured that any- one would bother to actually conduct some scholarly re- search. (4) In 1959 Adamski told a story about a train ride out of Kansas City during which the train unexpectedly stopped, so he got out to stretch his legs and had an en- counter with a spaceman who transported him by flying saucer to his destination. In an on-the-spot investigation by NICAP, sworn affidavits were obtained from the train crew proving that the train never stopped unexpectedly, and the vestibule doors were never opened except at the scheduled stops. (5) About 1960 (the records would be in the NICAP files) Adamski claimed that he had a friendly meeting with U.S. Sen. Margaret Chase Smith who, he implied, was interested in and supportive of his claims. I personally contacted Sen. Smith, and she replied in writing that she had never heard of Adamski and certainly did not support him. (6) On March 26,1960, Adamski gave a lecture at the Willard Hotel in Washington, D.C., which I attended. He had invited a panel of distinguished citizens (names on file) to participate in a discussion about space travel. Upon investigation, we had learned that the promoters invited the panelists to attend under totally false pretenses. They were told that \"Professor Adamski\" was an astronomer from California interested in promoting space travel, and not told about his claims about frequent liaison with space beings. After being advised about the latter, all seven in- vited panelists cancelled out. Amusingly, the master of ceremonies announced that the CIA or Air Force apparently had put pressure on the panelists to prevent them from taking part. (No, being informed of the truth did it!) Adamski recounted his 1952 contact, and announced that a German scientist in Africa had deciphered the symbols on the footprint left in the sand and they told how to construct and power a space ship.The scientist had constructed small working models which proved that it worked. Who and where is this sci- entist? Or, like the mythical and obscurely located scien- tists often cited by such newspapers as the National Ex- aminer, did he exist only in Adamski's imagination? Referring to his later contact experiences, Adamski described \"minerals\" or metals (he was not very literate) that had been dropped on the ground by spacemen. He said that analysis in England showed two elements not known on earth. Two female chemists in the U.S., he added, analyzed the material privately and found the same thing. Okay. Where are the analysis reports? Were they \"suppressed by the CIA or Air Force,\" or again only imagi- nary? During the question and answer period, Adamski stated that the far side of the Moon contained vegetation, and that the space people had bases on both sides. He also, ironically, disowned the \"mystics who are taking over the field\" and once referred to \"we Christians.\" I have on file the transcript of a lengthy debate between Adamski and an ordained Christian minister in which the latter sharply disputes Adamski's interpretations of the Bible and ar- gues that Adamski's (or his spacemen's) religion is dis- (Continued on Page 23)"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"Page 22 April 2001 MUFON UFO Journal The NIGHT SKY waiter N. WCDD May 2001 Bright Planets (Evening Sky): Hard-to-see Mercury has its best evening appearance of the year this month. Look for it with binoculars around the middle of the month in the WNW after sunset, glow- ing like a faint ember about 15 degrees above the horizon. The orange planet can be found near Jupiter on the 16th and near the lunar crescent on the 24th. Mars, in Sagittarius, brightens steadily as it advances toward opposition next month. It more than doubles its brightness again during May, from -1.1 to -2.1 magnitude, and is even brighter than Jupiter at month's end. At the same time it increases its apparent diameter from 14\" to 19\" of arc, the beginning of a prime observing window for telescopic observers of Mars. In mid-May the red planet rises in the SE about 10:30 PM. The planet begins retrograde (westward) motion on the 11 th, an illusion created by our Earth catching up to its smaller neighbor in space—like one car passing another on the highway. Jupiter (-2.0), in Taurus, lies low in the WNW at dusk, setting only about an hour and a half after the Sun in mid- May. The giant planet soon disappears into the solar glare, not to be seen again until July in the morning sky. Saturn (0.3), in Taurus, sets in the WNW less than an hour after sunset in early May. Thereafter, it becomes lost in the Sun's glare, moving into the morning sky on the 25th. Bright Planets (Morning Sky): Venus attains its greatest brilliancy in the morning sky on May 4 at -4.5 magnitude. The radiant planet rises in the E about 3:30 AM in midmonth (the start of morning twilight). Look for it about 4 degrees above the crescent Moon on the 19th. Mars stands due S at the beginning of morning twilight in mid-May. Moon Phases: Full moon—May 7 Last quarter—May 15 New. moon—May 22 First quarter—May 29 The Stars: Gathered around the N-S celestial meridian after twi- light ends are three star patterns. The upside-down Big Dipper (actually part of Ursa Major the Great Bear) rides high in the N and points the way to the other two pat- terns. First, extend the curve of the dipper's handle down- ward to find the bright orange star Arcturus. This star is located at the bottom of kite-shaped Bootes the Herdsman. Arcturus is the 3rd brightest luminary in the entire night sky; only Sirius and Canopus are brighter. If the curve is continued through Arcturus, the next bright star one comes to is bluish-white Spica in Virgo the Maiden. Spica is at the base of a huge crooked \"Y\" that slants up to the right. The upper branches of the \"Y\" embrace the so-called \"Realm of the Galaxies,\" a region chock-full of countless blurs of light (in a telescope)—each one a spiral galaxy of billions of stars similar to our own Milky Way. While amateur telescopes can see the brightest of these objects, it is estimated that more than 3,000 galaxies fill this particular region of space, at an average distance of some 50 million light years from Earth!

Many State Directors offer training classes to assist in the process, and team the trainees with seasoned investigators to work on current UFO cases. The main tool for trainees is the MUFON Field Investigator's Manual. The manual is organized for easy self-study, and is a useful document to have on hand for a variety of investigations. The Field Investigator's Manual may be ordered for $25 + $3.50 P&H from MUFON, P.O. Box 369, Morrison, CO 80465-0369. The final step in the process is for the trainee to re- quest a Field Investigator's exam from MUFON Head- quarters. The exam is an open-book self-administered test and may be ordered whenever the Field Investigator Trainee has completed the prescribed field of study and is ready to be tested. Vacant Board Position John Carpenter has vacated the post of MUFON Director of Abduction Research, citing personal reasons and the need to spend more time with his career activi- ties. For about 12 years John conducted his own personal research into the abduction aspects of UFO cases and shared the results of his work with MUFON through ar- ticles for the MUFON UFO Journal and MUFON UFO Symposia. We will miss this important source of infor- mation and thank John for his generosity in sharing the results of his work with MUFON UFO Journal readers and symposium attendees. Perspective... (Continued from Page 21) tinctly non-Christian. The clearest interpretation of all this is a man predis- posed to an Oriental mystical belief system who for rea- sons of personal gain (including psychological gain) formed a cult, worked the \"spaceman believer\" crowd, and had no regard for either consistency or truth. The \"truth\" was whatever served his immediate purposes, including trying to fit in by adjusting the \"truth\" to be an \"astronomer,\" a \"space travel advocate,\" and a \"Christian\" as required by current circumstances. His constant name-dropping and allusions to scientific evidence which is never produced are reminiscent of certain con-men operating today. For further reading, I recommend the entry on George Adamski in Jerome Clark's excellent UFO Encyclope- dia, The Emergence of a Phenomenon: UFOs from the Beginning through 1959 (Detroit: Omnigraphics, 1992). It contains further evidence of Adamski's duplic- ity and a good Bibliography of sources. Closing thought: Would you buy a used car from this man? Canadian UFO Reports Up 2% Last Year There were 2% more UFO reports filed in Canada in 2000 than 1999, according to the findings of a national study released recently. \"We found a slight increase over the year before,\" says Chris Rutkowski, editor of the study. \"There were 263 UFO sightings reported in Canada in 2000, about 11% more than the average recorded since 1989 when we began compiling this data.\" Rutkowski is research coordinator for Ufology Re- search of Manitoba (UFOROM), a civilian group that gathers and studies UFO reports made to Canadian vol- unteer civilian groups and government agencies. UFOROM has been publishing an annual survey of Ca- nadian UFO sightings since 1989 and has accumulated almost 3,000 Canadian UFO cases since the beginning of the last decade. They look at details such as where a UFO was seen, the time of day, its color, shape and observed behavior. Other findings of the 2000 study: In 2000, more UFOs were reported in the late summer and early fall than any other time of the year. About 13 % of all UFO reports were unexplained. This percentage of unknowns falls to about 5% when only high-quality cases are considered. UFO incidents usually have more than one witness; in fact, most UFO sightings have two wit- nesses, meaning that sightings can usually be corrobo- rated by someone else. The typical UFO sighting lasted between five and eight minutes in 2000, giving witnesses enough time to get a good look at what they were seeing. Most UFOs were reported in western and northern Canada, including the Yukon. \"We're not saying that aliens are invading Canada, only that people continue to report UFOs quite regularly,\" explains Rutkowski. \"Most UFOs have simple explana- tions, but the unexplained ones are still interesting, although not necessarily from Mars. Report numbers are increas- ing, even though in this advanced technological age, sci- ence tells us that UFOs aren't real.\" He adds: \"This research will allow scientists to be bet- ter informed concerning the actual characteristics of a popular social phenomenon that is pervasive in our cul- ture.\" For further information, contact: Chris Rutkowski, cap- tor, e-mail: rutk-@cc.umanitoba.ca or phone: 204-269- 7553 Geoff Dittman, data analysis, e-mail: gdit- @ autobahn.mb.ca The study is available online at: http:// www.geocities.com/aristotl.geo Story originally published by UFO Research of Manitoba News Release - Febru- ary 27, 2001 Alfred Webre Vancouver, BC EcoNews Service http://www.ecologynews.com"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"Page 24 April 2001 MUFON UFO Journal DIRECTOR'S MESSAGE John Schuessler By John Schuessler MUFON International Director MUFON 2001 UFO Symposium The MUFON 2001 Annual UFO Symposium will be held at the beautiful Hyatt Regency Irvine Hotel in Or- ange County, California, on July 20- 22. The theme of the event is \"2001-Joining the Cosmic Neigh- borhood.\" The symposium annually fea- tures top UFO researchers from around the world. This year is no exception. Harold E. Burt, au- thor of Flying Saucers 101, says, \"The work being done by the speak- ers in this year's symposium will eventually be recognized as more important to mankind than the work of Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Edison, and the Wright Brothers. Their efforts were limited to this planet and elementary physics. MUFON Symposium speakers take our understanding of physics, consciousness and science beyond the boundaries of our planet and our limited ex- perience. If you could go and witness the Declaration of Independence being signed or the Wright Brothers flying for the first time, would you go? Of course you would. For the very same reasons you should attend the MUFON Symposium 2001.\" Confirmed speakers now include Dr. John Mack, Dr. Bob Wood, Stanton T. Friedman, Dr. Barry Down- ing, Dr. Roger Leir, Dr. Eric Davis, Bob Pratt, Dr. Steven Greer, Jaime Maussan, Daniel Sheehan, Ryan Wood, Ann Druffel, and Joe McMoneagle. The symposium committee has established admission rates for attendees at one-half to one-fourth the cost of most UFO conferences. In addition there is a price break for early registration. The admission price for the whole conference is $99 per person prior to July 1.2001. Ad- mission at the door will be $ 109 per person for all speaker presentations. Please send your registration to MUFON ORANGE COUNTY, 19744, PMB 264, Huntington Beach, CA 92648. Make checks payable to \"MUFON.\" MUFON has reserved a block of rooms for sympo- sium attendees at $89/night from Thursday, July 19, through Tuesday, July 24. The usual rate for these same rooms is $205 per night.

MUFON Volunteers - Thank You MUFON's mission is the systematic collection and analysis of UFO data, with the ultimate goal of learning the origin and nature of the UFO phenomenon. This is a big job that it is being done by volunteers. Now that I am in a position to see how much work everyone is doing, I want to say \"thank you\" to all MUFON members-Field Investigators, Field Investigator Trainees, State & Provincial Directors, State Section Directors, Research Specialists, Consultants, Amateur Radio Op- erators, Translators, Foreign Representatives, Board Members, Journal Subscribers, and Staff. One of MUFON's strengths is the diversity seen in our membership. The diversity in skills, backgrounds, inter- ests, thoughts, beliefs, and capabilities across our mem- bership is as wide as the diversity in the population of the United States. Personally, I appreciate and respect that diversity and welcome it. Without it we will probably never solve the UFO mystery. All I ask is that we are unified in fulfilling MUFON's mission statement as noted above. New State Officers George Lund, State Director for North Carolina, has named Margaret Price to the position of Assistant State Director. Bland Pugh, State Director for Florida, has announced the following new State Section Director appointments: Jakie Miller for Okaloosa and Walton Counties and Philip Mark for Lake and Marion Counties. New Field Investigators Kathleen Marden, Director of Field Investigator Training, has announced the following Field Investigator Trainees have successfully completed the Field Investigator's Exam and are now certified MUFON Field Investigators: Robert Ash, Japan: Rubin J. Clinger, Toquerville, Utah; Dean Moritz, St. Louis Park, Minne- sota; Thomas A. Shelton, Port St. Lucie, Florida; and David Twitchell, Trenton, Michigan. MUFON is fortunate to have an ever-growing number of Field Investigator Trainees. Our goal for trainees is for them to move through the training process as rapidly as (Continued on Page 23)"}]
