This is Part 2 continued from the previous issue of the Journal (September 2007, pp. 3-10). The Disinformation Feedback Loop Pioneer Roswell investigator William L. Moore set up himself and his partner Stanton T. Friedman for having their own Roswell investigative data fed back to them by special agent Richard Doty and his superiors at AFOSI in the form of government documents that were faked to look like they spectacularly “confirmed” what they had already previously found—but mixed in with confounding disinformation. As we reported in the first part of this article, Moore saw with his own eyes how info he had discussed with Doty at length in late 1982 was converted into a fake document, the infamous Aquarius Carter document with Jesus Christ as alien, in April 1983. Moore told me at the time that he was passing on to AFOSI every scrap of Roswell info and inside info on UFO groups. 1 Every major finding Friedman and Moore turned up on Roswell was recycled into government documents coming back from Doty/AFOSI, as Friedman himself admits. If MJ-12 is a hoax, states Friedman, then “somebody had to do a lot of homework that no one else has done”—meaning no one except for Friedman and Moore of course. 2 And Moore had been passing all their UFO/Roswell “homework” on to Doty/AFOSI. In his MJ-12 defense book, TOP SECRET/MAJIC (2005 rev.), Friedman writes about how so much of what was in the Eisenhower Briefing Document (EBD) was already known to him and Moore before the EBD showed up in 1984: “... the simple fact of the matter is that Moore, Shandera, and I had already picked up on all the names of the [MJ- 12 membership] list prior to receipt of the [EBD] film (except for Dr. Donald Menzel) 3 as a result of the many days spent in archival research begun a decade ago.... We had noted who was where in early July 1947, when the Roswell incident occurred.” “I started rereading my files on the other people listed in the [EBD] document, all of whom had popped out in one way or another in our attempts to fathom the government’s early UFO operations.” “Whether the [Eisenhower Briefing] documents are valid or not, they must have been created by an insider , and Jaime and Bill had been having conversations with insiders (including Richard Doty of the OSI ) for years before Jaime got the [Eisenhower Briefing Document] film.” 4 Those “conversations with insiders (including Richard Doty of the OSI)” that Jaime Shandera and Bill Moore had been having “for years,” according to Friedman himself, included extensive info on Roswell, of course, because that was what was in the MJ-12 documents. Their Roswell info showed up in the MJ-12 Eisenhower Briefing Document (EBD), with all its “created by an insider” data on Roswell contained within it (along with all the false info or disinformation planted within it too). This is what Friedman himself tells us. We should believe him when he makes such a damaging admission. To Moore and Friedman, when their Roswell “facts” turned up in a document it looked like a confirmation of their investigation, when it was nothing but a feedback loop of their own research coming back to haunt them. As Pratt said years later in a 1989 letter to Bob Todd, the MJ-12 Eisenhower Briefing Document was too convenient; it wrapped up everything ufologists wanted to believe all in one package—the Roswell crash recovery, dead aliens, autopsies, top scientists, secret agencies, Presidential orders, cover stories—but without any actual substantiation, just dead-ends, and embedded in a poisonous context of false and misleading assertions. Example of Disinformation Feedback Loop—the Ike Transition of November 1952 In the July 7-9, 1982, meeting with Pratt, Moore explained how Eisenhower allegedly got involved with the Aquarius 1 Moore meeting with Sparks and Kal Korff, Jan. 17, 1982. Moore repeatedly alludes to his mass UFO info transfers to Doty / AFOSI: Moore, MUFON 1989 Symposium MJ-12 statement, slightly edited, MUFON UFO Journal (MUJ), Nov. 1989, pp. 12b, 15b, 16a; Dec. 1989, p. 9a, etc. 2 Friedman interview quote in his hometown paper, Fredericton, New Brunswick, Daily Gleaner, Aug. 28, 1987, p. 16c. 3 See similar quote in Friedman, MUFON 1989 Symposium MJ-12 paper, p. 88. In fact, even the one alleged exception, notorious UFO debunker astronomer Donald Menzel, had turned up by 1980 in the Friedman- Moore research, based on my discovery that Menzel had been in New Mexico on a classified AF contract in the late 1940’s. This info and my article on Menzel were no doubt passed on to Doty/AFOSI along with all the rest of the Friedman-Moore Roswell research, as Moore indicated to me on Jan. 17, 1982. To Friedman’s way of thinking this meant “Menzel was the right scientist, with the right credentials, at the right time, to head up the Roswell investigation in 1947. He had all the right clearances and was right there on the scene in New Mexico.” Stan wrote in his TS/Majic book (p. 130) quoted above, that prior to the 1984 MJ-12 documents, “We had noted who was where in early July 1947, when the Roswell incident occurred,” which among others alludes to Menzel whose whereabouts in NM Stan knew from my research. 4 Friedman, TS/MAJIC (1996/2005) pp. 130, 28, 138-9, emphasis added."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"October 2007 4 MUFON UFO Journal Continued on page 5 Pratt Tapes and MJ-12 Continued from page 3 briefing document at the end of 1952. Then he immediately launched into an intense discussion about that critical transition period between the Truman and Eisenhower administrations beginning in November 1952, a date that Moore particularly stressed. Because of the occurrence of the CIA Robertson Panel in that transition period, Moore and Friedman had been researching it since obtaining the CIA FOIA documents in 1979. So it is no wonder that the November 1952 date was fixated on by AFOSI/Doty. All Moore’s and Friedman’s research on Presidential meetings was relayed to Doty (as Moore told me he was doing) and then converted into manufactured documents bearing their research. Thus November 1952 becomes the alleged briefing date of Eisenhower in the Eisenhower Briefing Document that turned up in Jaime Shandera’s mailbox in December 1984. Doty’s AACS Story—Another Example of Disinformation Feedback In Moore’s July 1982 comment to Pratt about the Truman- Eisenhower transition and the CIA, he also referred to the Air Force agency AACS as supposedly “investigating UFOs,” based on a CIA memo mentioning the widely publicized Videon camera project by Project Blue Book, which later became a fiasco as the cameras were useless. But the Airways and Air Communications Service was merely the AF’s air traffic control agency, and it had no role or function in investigating UFOs, which belonged to AF Intelligence. Moore’s misinterpretation of the failed Videon camera project was translated by Doty into an elaborate false story of the AACS as engaged in high-powered secret investigations of UFO cases using mobile and airborne “monitoring equipment.” Doty’s Elaborate Stories About a NASA Cover-up The Pratt files record a mass of alleged information (actually disinformation) from Doty and AFOSI alleging that the civilian space agency NASA was heavily involved in secret investigations of UFOs instead of the AF which was barely mentioned. Doty went to great lengths to fabricate bogus NASA “intelligence” units and scientist officials, which he accused of covering up UFOs. Doty charged that NASA was covering up astronaut encounters with UFOs in space and had falsified photographs to do so, as well as using secret radio communications with astronauts to report encounters to ground control. Doty even managed to shift the blame for AFOSI’s keen interest in Bennewitz onto NASA, claiming that it was not the AF that was doing it. Rather “NASA was actively watching him and monitoring [his] activities,” and “NASA got copies of all his photos and much of his instrument data.” 5 This is the first time NASA has been accused of putting people under surveillance as if it was a counterintelligence agency. The Strange Avoidance of Faking AF Documents One subtle indicator of AF involvement in forging government UFO documents is the virtual absence of any Air Force documents being faked. Faking AF documents seems to be off limits to AF disinformation agents (until they read this and get authorization to prove us wrong by surfacing a flurry of fake AF documents). The closest one comes to AF documents being faked are some of the Timothy Cooper era MJ-12 forgeries in the 1990s, now promoted by the overly accepting Woods (who have apparently never met an MJ-12 document they did not like and could declare for certain was a forgery 6 ). Some of these forgeries were made up as Army Air Forces documents before the AF became an independent branch of the military on September 18, 1947. A few such badly botched fakes are allegedly Army intelligence documents such as the egregiously blundered Army “Interplanetary Phenomenon Unit” (IPU) directive to investigate Roswell, supposedly signed or initialed by the “G-2” chief Major General Chamberlin in July 1947—when G-2 did not even exist and Chamberlin never even served as “G-2.” 7 The G-2 (Army Intelligence) term was abolished in 1946 and not re-established until four years later, so would not have been used in 1947. The IPU was not created until 1958. IPU did not stand for such a preposterously sensational and revealing unit designation as “Interplanetary Phenomenon Unit” despite the mistaken recollection of a veteran intelligence official decades later. FOIA research turned up what “IPU” actually stood for—Input Processing Unit—and traced its organizational history which happened to include UFO report processing among its other duties (hence the understandable mistake in calling it “interplanetary phenomenon” when the Close Encounters movie was in everyone’s minds in 1977-8 when the “IPU” first surfaced). 8 A somewhat related issue is why are there so many active and retired AF personnel coming forward with crashed saucer and alien body recovery stories that are dead-ends, that lead absolutely nowhere, no paper trails going anywhere, no physical evidence?? 5 Moore memo in Pratt files, Oct. 18, 1981 (rev. Jan. 2, 1982) p. 4. 6 Ryan Wood was asked at the special MJ-12 panel of the MUFON Symposium in Denver, on Aug. 11, 2007, how many fraudulent MJ-12 documents he had come across. Wood answered “none.” 7 Maj. Gen. Stephen J. Chamberlin never served as “G-2” at all. He was made the very first Army Director of Intelligence on June 11, 1946, when G-2 was abolished and the vastly enlarged agency, created by merger of multiple agencies, became the ID or Intelligence Division of the War Dept. (Army) General Staff, not “G-2.” 8 Forthcoming research by Sparks."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"      5 MUFON UFO Journal October 2007 Continued from page 4 Continued on page 6 Pratt Tapes and MJ-12 NASA, Carter and the Rise of Crashed Saucers in 1977, the Seeds of MJ-12 Why did Doty go to such obsessive lengths to invoke, even entrap, NASA into a UFO cover-up? Why did he fixate on the year 1977 and Carter being briefed on UFOs instead of other Presidents? And why bring up Steven Spielberg? Why the Ellsworth hoax in January 1978? Why drag in Jesus Christ as an alien? A simple answer connects all these elements—as characters in the AF and AFOSI paranoid vision of ufologists. One must think like a paranoid AF counterintelligence planner. This requires an historical overview of the AF’s clandestine warfare against the UFO field, which will put the pattern of AF hostility into a clear context for AFOSI fixation on NASA, Carter, Spielberg and 1977. The AF feared the rekindling of a massive UFO sighting wave like 1973, this time triggered by the release of Steven Spielberg’s blockbuster movie, Close Encounters of the Third Kind, which premiered on November 16, with nationwide release December 14, 1977, and which set all-time records for box office attendance . Indeed the media soon afterward reported rather sensationally that the movie had provoked a flood of UFO sighting reports. At this same time, it was widely reported in the media on November 26, 1977, that Jimmy Carter’s White House had asked NASA to reopen the government’s UFO inquiry. 9 The press reported that the “White House has asked NASA to look at the saucer data collected through the years by the Air Force and others.” 10 This published assertion in the national media must have greatly alarmed the AF, which had enjoyed a decade of relative peace without a Project Blue Book as a sitting-duck target for all sorts of inquiries and criticism. Project Blue Book had closed for good in January 1970; at least on the surface it had appeared that the government was out of the UFO business. 11 Now it looked like the AF’s UFO actions in the past were going to be subjected to NASA scientific review and possibly get the AF raked over the coals (again) for the numerous shortcomings in its past handling of the UFO phenomenon—cataloged in ugly detail by former AF UFO scientific consultant on Project Blue Book, Dr. J. Allen Hynek, in his classic 1972 textbook of UFO science, The UFO Experience . It must have seemed as if the new Navy-man President in the White House was out to “get” the AF. NASA’s assistant for special projects, David W illiamson, told the Associated Press that: “We are not anxious to do it [investigate UFOs] because we’re not sure what we can do. There is no measurable UFO evidence such as a piece of metal, flesh or cloth. We don’t even have any radio signals. A photograph is not a measurement.” Williamson explained, “Give me one little green man, not a theory or memory of one, and we can have a multimillion dollar program.” NASA suggested there might be UFO crash evidence or aliens that could be studied in a lab. It was the first time the government had ever taken such a thing seriously and it opened the floodgates for alleged alien crash stories to be spread. Prior to late 1977, crashed saucers and alien bodies had not been on the list of credible subjects in UFO research. Then, Leonard Stringfield began to receive increasing numbers of crashed saucer reports, mostly from AF-related personnel, till it reached the point in early 1978 when he decided this was a phenomenon in and of itself, which needed special investigation. He coined the term “crash retrieval” or C/R and started collecting and publishing C/R reports on a frequent basis. 12 The NASA White House initiative, the emergence of the first Roswell witness, the Ellsworth hoax, the dawn of crashed saucers as a major theme of ufology, Todd Zechel’s Texas-Mexico saucer crash story, the Spielberg blockbuster, all converge in 1977 and 1978. Thus the seeds were planted for MJ-12. The AF Feared Hynek’s UFO Revelations The Spielberg movie’s CE-III name itself was derived from a scientific UFO sighting category devised by Hynek and published in his UFO Experience textbook. The Hynek connection was a bright red flag to the AF, which viewed Hynek as a traitor who spilled the AF’s UFO secrets in his stinging tell-all book (tell-all from the standpoint of an insecure aggressive AF bureaucracy). Project Blue Book’s retired chief, AF Lt. Col. Hector Quintanilla, wrote in his memoirs about how Hynek was considered a traitor by the AF. Hynek was a highly respected astronomer who had many contacts in the scientific community who could join together to challenge the AF on UFOs. Moreover, Hynek supported Congressional hearings on the UFO problem, which would certainly subject the AF to the feared public scrutiny the AF wished to avoid at all costs. AFOSI had already targeted Hynek with multiple disinformation operations to try to discredit him when his much-feared book, The UFO Experience, came out in 1972 and even afterward. 13 Meanwhile the AF found out about the threatening White House-NASA initiative from one of its generals working as a spy 9 Even after the public NASA rebuff on Dec. 21, 1977, to the White House request NASA privately continued to pursue the matter internally, into 1978.

A remarkable letter was sent by the AF public relations chief, Col. Charles Senn, to AF Lt. Gen. Duward L. Crow, then serving as a top NASA administrator, on September 1, 1977. Colonel Senn revealed the sense of alarm the AF was feeling over a possible NASA venture into UFO investigations by acknowledging with relief the fact that Gen. Crow was working from inside NASA to try to stop the UFO initiative: “I sincerely hope you are successful in preventing a reopening of UFO investigations.” Thus, there was a powerful convergence of potential and real threats to the AF and the AF’s position on UFOs in November- December 1977—from the White House, NASA, the media, the public, the scientific community and from its own turncoat scientific adviser Hynek who was now seemingly backed by a highly successful and influential movie producer (Spielberg). It is no wonder that suddenly in late 1977 a new AFOSI disinformation operation against ufology would be hatched, in the form of Doty and the Ellsworth AFB hoax at first and growing in scope for years to come. Why Ellsworth? The nightmarish Ellsworth story of an aliens vs. US military shoot-out was a perfect reversal of and a slam on the Spielberg Close Encounters movie in which the peaceful aliens meet humans at the finale. Ellsworth AFB in South Dakota is just across the state line from Devil’s Tower, Wyoming, the scene of the climactic end of Close Encounters. The Ellsworth deadly alien-shootout theme would be recycled again in the hallucinations evidently planted on Bennewitz, where once again the alien/human cooperation at a secret base of operations breaks down into armed battle, this time at Archuleta Peak, Dulce, New Mexico. Dragging in the silly claim that Jesus Christ was an alien in the MJ-12 Aquarius story was an obvious slam on Jimmy Carter’s pious Christian faith widely discussed in the media. Ufology vs. AF—or Us vs. Them We need to see it from the AF’s perspective—not to agree with it, but to understand their point of view. Ufology struggles with this because its researchers and activists are so obsessed with seeking proof of alien visitation that they do not see that this activity provokes the government. From the AF’s perspective as a military force, the world is viewed in aggressive black-and-white terms of enemies and allies. Enemies are to be subdued or destroyed. (“Adversaries” is the more politically correct term used.) Air supremacy is the central doctrine of the AF. Air supremacy requires that the USAF control the air and space environments to support national policy and prevent the neutralization or interference with its mission by any and all adversaries in order to maintain its supremacy. Ufology, in today’s intelligence parlance, is called a “single- issue extremist group”— something similar to, say, Greenpeace or the ACLU—and considered to be ranked just below the level of a terrorist group. In the AF’s point of view, UFO groups, activists and researchers oppose the AF, impede its operations and tie up its resources. ATIC commander Brig. Gen. Harold Watson acidly described UFO “club” members in a memo to the AF Director of Intelligence, Maj. Gen. John Samford, as: 14 “... unscrupulous individuals who see in the [UFO] subject an opportunity of abusing the Air Force while serving their own ends, be they personal gain or subversion .” Former Project Blue Book chief, Lt. Col. Hector Quintanilla, explained in his 1974 retirement memoirs how the AF viewed ufologists: “... the Air Force took one hell of a beating from self- styled UFO experts, UFO Hobby Clubs, and poetic authors.” To the AF, the field of ufology is an opponent to be subdued, disrupted or neutralized. To the AF, “ ‘the enemy’ is the UFO investigator.” 15 Ufology groups and investigators are seen as a threat to AF activities and overall mission, and to particular missions of specific commands and activities such as AF Intelligence. The Long AF Battle Against Ufologist Enemies The AF has a long history of controversy and disputes with ufologists, which has institutionally made the AF in effect tacitly declare war against ufology. Look at it from the AF’s paranoid mindset. 16 In 1949 a Navy man, Donald Keyhoe, a respected retired major in the Marines (which were part of the Navy), started intruding into AF intelligence matters on UFOs, threatening to dig up and expose AF secrets. When Keyhoe comes along to cause the AF trouble over an embarrassing air intelligence matter, UFOs, he is joined by another Navy man, active duty Cdr. Robert McLaughlin, USN. Both Keyhoe and McLaughlin of course are now famous in UFO history as they were shortly to publish groundbreaking sensational articles in True magazine claiming UFOs were from 14 Watson memo to Samford, July 7, 1955, as quoted in the memoirs of former Project Blue Book chief, Lt. Col. Hector Quintanilla, 1974, unpublished manuscript posted on NIDS website, p. 16. 15 Collins-Doty-Cooper, Exempt From Disclosure, p. 5. Collins and Doty have long experience in the AF, Doty specifically in AFOSI counter- intelligence. This candid admission deserves more credence, as it is quite a departure from the wild disinformation about aliens riddling the whole book. 16 Cf. Bishop, Project Beta, pp. 7, 48, on official “paranoia” and “constant public-relations headache” of UFOs. 17 Donald E. Keyhoe, “The Flying Saucers Are Real,” True (Jan. 1950) published Dec. 26, 1949; Robert B. McLaughlin, “How Scientists Tracked A Flying Saucer!” True (March 1950) published Feb. 22, 1950."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"      7 MUFON UFO Journal October 2007 Continued from page 6 Continued on page 8 Pratt Tapes & MJ-12 outer space and implying or stating outright (in Keyhoe’s case) that the AF knew it but was not saying so publicly. 17 AFOSI is involved at this early date. McLaughlin earned the everlasting ire of the AF and gave AFOSI a bad headache by officially releasing highly sensitive AF UFO secrets to the press. The AF tried to get McLaughlin court-martialed but found it could not touch him because he was in the Navy, a military service the AF could not control. The Navy ended up promoting McLaughlin. Historian David Jacobs summed up the long-ranging impact of the True magazine articles ny the Navy men on the AF UFO controversy: “The Keyhoe and McLaughlin articles were the first in a national magazine to present a case for extraterrestrial explanations for UFOs and to contradict official Air Force findings . The articles set the stage for a battle [between the AF and UFO groups] that was to rage for the next twenty years .” 18 To the AF, this must have looked like a Navy plot to humiliate the AF, one way to get payback for the Navy losing the Admirals’ Revolt. Naturally then, when Navy man Keyhoe kept popping up again and again year after year to pester the AF over UFOs the AF saw this as a continuation of the Navy plot to get back at the AF. When Keyhoe took over the helm at NICAP in January 1957, the AF saw more trouble brewing than ever before. Keyhoe brought in friends, prominent retired Navy admirals including the former CIA Director, to chair the NICAP Board. This must have been an ominous development for the AF. Keyhoe also had been agitating for a Congressional hearing for some time to haul up the AF in front of cameras and beat it over the figurative head for its UFO policies. Now Keyhoe had an organization at his command to launch a public campaign to press for Congressional hearings. Again, this had to look to the AF like a “Navy plot.” The AF pulled out all the stops to stymie, harass and ruin NICAP under Keyhoe, including apparently siccing the IRS on NICAP in 1958 and attempting to have Keyhoe brought up on bogus criminal charges of unauthorized possession of classified information in 1960. 19 NICAP for its part succeeded in getting the AF dragged in front of Congressional hearings but only in closed-door meetings. The AF suffered many traumatic close calls in averting public hearings, and NICAP was probably instrumental in making possible the one public hearing that did occur, on April 5, 1966, an historic event. But the AF eventually got its way in destroying NICAP and firing Keyhoe, just in time to coincide with the AF’s closure of its public relations nightmare, Project Blue Book, announced on December 17, 1969. The AF did not want NICAP under Keyhoe to gloat and somehow claim victory against the AF with the demise of Blue Book. The three AF-affiliated men who constituted all three of the members of the Executive Committee of the NICAP Board of Governors peremptorily fired Keyhoe on December 3, 1969. The NICAP Ex Com troika was led by an AF reserve officer with a clandestine background who was formerly the No. 1 CIA official in charge of covert political and psychological warfare. He was the pioneer leader in psychological operations, an expert in the infiltration and destruction of adversary organizations by clever psych war tricks and manipulation of financial weaknesses, which he now used against the financially vulnerable NICAP. In view of this brief history of aggressive AF UFO paranoia, it is safe to say then that AF hates ufology, has a long-standing vendetta against perceived Navy threats to its dominance as the largest and politically most powerful military service, and will stop at nothing to prevent another humiliating Congressional hearing to disgrace the AF over UFOs. Today if someone attempts to initiate Congressional investigations of the UFO cover-up, various organizations are waiting in the wings to muscle their way into the effort. They claim to be “assisting,” but in reality supply a mix of genuine and bogus “witnesses” and “documents” telling bizarre tales of alien activities designed to be easily exposed as fraudulent, which would collapse any such effort before it got anywhere. Who is behind these Congressional-oriented organizations which seemed to come out of nowhere, and certainly did not come from any existing legitimate UFO research organization? AFOSI Has Regulations to Justify its Targeting of Ufology AFOSI serves as the AF’s bodyguard of professional dirty tricksters, and functions within a web of defense regulations that actually authorize and spell out the kind of questionable tactics used against UFO research groups and individuals in the United States (see below). Many UFO organizations in the US such as MUFON have a large contingent of “foreign representatives” and foreign branches and affiliate groups, which make for easy paperwork justifications of counterintelligence surveillance, investigation and “neutralization” of such foreign-linked domestic “US persons” (a broad term including both people and organizations). Such “US persons” who can be targets of AFOSI operations “include corporations and other commercial organizations, academic institutions, clubs, professional societies, associations, and any other group whose existence is formalized in some 18 Jacobs, UFO Controversy in America (1976 ed.) p. 50, emphasis added. 19 See AFOSI and FBI FOIA files. Moore-Shandera MJ-12 Report, p. 15."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"October 2007 8 MUFON UFO Journal Continued on page 9 Pratt Tapes & MJ-12 Continued from page 7 manner or otherwise functions on a continuing basis.” 20 In other words, the targeted US persons do not have to be foreign agents or terrorists. AF policy directives define one of AFOSI’s main duties as investigating and reporting any “threats” to DoD or to AF “mission” or “activities.” 21 Such threats to military missions and activities are treated more broadly than just threats to life and property, which are mentioned separately in the directives. A ufologist who files 1,000 FOIA requests with the AF might be seen as posing a “threat” to the AF “mission” by interfering with the orderly functioning of the AF commands that are overwhelmed and burdened with responding to the FOIAs. Again we are looking at it in the way the AF sees it, not the way a civil libertarian might see it with all the trampling of Constitutional rights obviously involved in the AF’s heavy- handed tactics. Those in, say, MUFON who communicate with active and retired AF personnel to seek out secret AF data on crashed saucers and alien corpses, may be seen by AFOSI as soliciting the unauthorized release of classified information or even un classified so-called “controlled information” (such as For Official Use Only). AFOSI Counterintelligence Aims to “Neutralize” AF Enemies Such as Ufology AFOSI’s “counterintelligence investigation” does more than just collect information, it can “neutralize” and “counter” the targets of those investigations even if they are “US persons.” Pursuant to high-level directives, the AF “will conduct counterintelligence activities ... to detect and neutralize threats against the Air Force” and AFOSI “Assesses threats and develops programs to counter them.” 22 AFOSI can infiltrate US organizations such as MUFON because their counterintelligence activities can “include collecting information, identifying potential sources or contacts, or establishing and maintaining cover.” They may also infiltrate “for the purpose of influencing the activities of the organization or its members .” 23 Not just to gather info but to take over the organization or neutralize it. AFOSI counterintelligence goes far beyond just collecting info with its vast array of electronic surveillance, mail covers, satellite recon, “remote monitoring,” and other intrusive techniques listed in the regulations. AF Information Operations (IO) include Influence Operations (IFO) 24 which in turn “include counterpropaganda operations, psychological operations (PSYOP), military deception (MILDEC), operations security (OPSEC), counterintelligence (CI) operations, and public affairs.” Such influence operations seek to “influence, disrupt, corrupt or usurp” an adversary or an adversary’s information and decision making. 25 As we have seen briefly above, there is a whole track record of AF disruption and disinformation operations against ufology since at least 1949 (disinformation being a technique used in military deception, psyops and counterintelligence). Disinformation Confession in the Doty-Gersten Meetings, January 10-11, 1983 On January 10 and 11, 1983, Doty met with Peter Gersten, lawyer and founder of Citizens Against UFO Secrecy (CAUS), a private organization devoted to pursuing government UFO data through the FOIA. Gersten had flown out from NYC to Albuquerque to meet with Doty. We now know for the first time, from Pratt’s detailed notes, that AFOSI agent Doty told attorney Gersten at their January 11 meeting that AFOSI was engaging in a disinformation operation against UFO groups and researchers. Doty indicated to Gersten he was part of the operation and that he was passing on such misinformation to Gersten, without specifying which of it was false. This startling revelation came at the very end of his two days’ meetings with Gersten, suggesting it was a reluctant admission. 26 Moore’s collaborator Stanton Friedman also must have heard something similar a few months before because Friedman wrote to the then MUFON director Walt Andrus on September 26, 1982: “I am intrigued by the notion that there are government agents monitoring the civilian UFO scene, putting out disinformation, thoroughly muddying the waters.” 20 Department of Defense (DoD) Directive 5240.1R “Procedures Governing the Activities of DoD Intelligence Components That Affect United States Persons,” Dec. 1982, Procedure 10, sec. B.2; AF Instruction (AFI) 14- 104, “Oversight of Intelligence Activities,” 16 April 2007, subsec. 11.10.1, passim. 21 AF Instruction (AFI) 71-101V4, “Special Investigations: Counterintelligence,” 1 August 2000, subsec. 2.5.2; AFI 14-104, sec. 12. 22 AF Policy Directive (AFPD) 71-1, “Special Investigations: Criminal Investigations and Counterintelligence,” 1 July 1999, subsecs. 3 and 7.4.2. 23 DoD Directive 5240.1R, Procedure 10, secs.

AFI 14-104, subsec. 11.10.1. 24 Yes that is the official AF abbreviation for Influence Operations, “IFO” (instead of, say, INO) perhaps signaling a subtle hostility to “UFO,” and ironically employing IFO (Influence Operations) in the execution of that hostility. Maybe the psyops planners who concocted that abbreviation had a good laugh among themselves and joked “Now we use IFO to defeat UFO!” 25 AF Policy Directive (AFPD) 10-7, “Information Operations,” 6 September 2006, paras. 1.2, 2.1, pp. 18, 21, emphasis added. 26 Pratt notes of telephone conversation with Peter Gersten, Jan. 25, 1983. See also Bishop, Project Beta, p. 205, where Doty admits to Linda Howe in their meeting in AFOSI offices on April 9, 1983, that he chose her instead of the New York T imes because she is “much easier to control.”"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"      9 MUFON UFO Journal October 2007 Continued on page 10 Pratt Tapes & MJ-12 Continued from page 8 Maybe Doty spoke out because his conscience bothered him—after he had done his official duty in these two meetings to try to discredit Gersten, who was suing the USAF over the Cash-Landrum UFO case injuries. 27 Doty had tried to outright infiltrate Gersten’s office by asking for a job with CAUS after Gersten would not take the bait for what Gersten saw as a document entrapment. This is the first time that such an admission of anti-ufology covert operations was made by an AFOSI official while he was an active duty special agent engaging in the operation , not something stated years after the fact, after retirement, or by someone with no firsthand knowledge. The Pratt files make this an evidentiary matter for the first time. Conversely there has never been any active or retired AFOSI agent who has ever leaked any claim asserting a non - disinformation explanation such as the “rogue agent” theory. There are no witnesses, no government documents, and no evidence claiming a “rogue agent” scenario. While an official AFOSI statement denying Doty’s operation might be too much to expect, given the sheer volume of MJ-12 babble that has been published surely by random statistical chance one would think that we would have at least heard a rumor from retired AF personnel that “Doty was just hoaxing documents to make money in a 6-figure Hollywood movie deal” or something like it. But no such rumors are known. And no evidence that Doty ever pursued Hollywood producer Shandera or others for such big money deals. Moreover there is no known precedent in AFOSI history or U.S. intelligence history or world intelligence history of an active duty intelligence officer forging documents for sale or for profit. There is a definite pattern to US Government disinformation campaigns against ufology going all the way back to 1949 or earlier, and it clearly cannot be explained as money-loving “rogue agent” activity when it spans so many decades. Doty was not around in 1949 when the first AF “live alien meeting” story was concocted. Nor was Doty in AFOSI in 1972 when AFOSI approached film producers Allan Sandler and Robert Emenegger with the same bogus promises (of supplying hundreds of feet of film of an alleged UFO landing at Holloman AFB and aliens meeting with AF officers) that were recycled again and again over the years (Doty with Linda Howe in 1983, Norton AFB AFOSI with Hynek in 1984-5, etc.). How the AFOSI Disinformation Against Ufology Works Based on his AFOSI contacts Moore explained to Pratt in the taped sessions on July 7-9, 1982, how the disinformation operation against ufology works: Moore: How many people would it take working full time to sow confusion, [to] keep the UFO groups off balance? ... It wouldn’t take too many people to keep us off track ... pursuing something that isn’t deemed to be too important. It wouldn’t ... be a major operation .... It just wouldn’t take that much and ... I think that’s what we’re experiencing here, that’s why we’ve never been able to get off the ground [in UFO research]. When NICAP really began to get threatening to the Air Force , beginning to have an undue influence in the government sector, ... they [NICAP] were simply derailed at that point . And now all of a sudden we find out that their Board was riddled with CIA people and the guy who replaces Keyhoe as director [Col. Joseph Bryan III, USAFR] has questionable connections and the fellow who takes over for him even more questionable connections. Who knows how many people in the other organizations aren’t in the same boat? ... Pratt: There are enough bona fide nuts in the field to— Moore: Of course—you encourage an Adamski here, a Richard Andolucci [Orfeo Angelucci] there, you encourage a Wendelle Stevens here, you encourage any number of those people ... they don’t take much encouragements [to do what they do]. All they need is a little attention, so you show them how to get it and they do the job for you without you ever having to pay them . The same sense with Phil Klass. They don’t have to put him on the payroll . They just need to encourage him to continue what he’s doing. So, any time he flags in his effort they dump a little more seemingly bona fide debunking information on him that “it couldn’t be so because”—and he takes it from there. Why pay him? In Moore’s infamous 1989 confession to the MUFON Symposium in Las Vegas, Nevada, he presented more specifics of how the rumor mill aspect of UFO disinformation works: 28 “Every time one of you repeats an unverified or unsubstantiated bit of information without qualifying it as such, you are contributing to that process; and every time you do it, somebody in a need-to-know position sits back and has a horse laugh at your expense.” Moore and Shandera describe the neutralizing effects of the anti-UFO disinformation, which: 29 “... bury public interest in UFOs by confounding the curious with an array of increasingly outrageous and incredible 27 Moore-Shandera MJ-12 Report, p. 11. 28 Moore, MUFON 1989 MJ-12 statement, MUJ, Dec. 1989, pp. 9c-10a, emphasis added, except the pure italics were in the original. 29 Moore-Shandera MJ-12 Report, p. 105."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"October 2007 10 MUFON UFO Journal Pratt Tapes & MJ-12 Continued from page 9 tales which sap their strength, drain their resources and strain their reputations to the point where they will either stop digging or dig only in carefully fenced-off, perfectly harmless places.” Short History and Pre-History of MJ-12 In 1950, Frank Scully had written about a similar but not very credible Aztec, New Mexico, saucer crash in his notorious book Behind the Flying Saucers , widely lambasted as a hoax, and which interestingly was based on the Roswell incident if one digs into the details. As the late pioneer of crashed saucer research, Leonard Stringfield, recounted it: “So completely was Scully’s retrieval story put down that some researchers today wonder, in retrospect, if the book and/or its exposure were contrived .” 30 Radio broadcast commentator Frank Edwards lectured on the Roswell case circa 1955-6 and put the story in somewhat garbled form in his 1966 bestseller, Flying Saucers—Serious Business. The 1965 Kecksburg, Pennsylvania, crashed UFO incident (most likely the meteor fireball seen in the exact area at the exact time) created a brief flurry in the media but was just as quickly forgotten. In 1974-5 Robert Spencer Carr publicized his “Hangar 18” claims that the AF held a recovered UFO and preserved alien bodies at that hangar or building at Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio. Carr alleged he had five main “sources,” some possibly imaginary, including some that seem to resurface years later in the revived Roswell saga, such as the “surgical nurse” at the alien autopsy. The nurse supposedly assisted in the military autopsy of an alien body recovered in a saucer crash in New Mexico. But the nurse story has never been substantiated nor the nurse ever even positively identified in either Carr’s version or the Glenn Dennis Roswell-version. Another Carr story appears to be that of Barney Barnett of Socorro, NM, which started Carr on his crashed saucer odyssey when he heard it in 1961. 31 Barnett’s story was a rehash of Scully, first told to friends in February 1950 right after the Scully story attracted national attention in Time and Newsweek magazines and other media in January 1950. Barnett recited his alleged discovery of burned alien bodies and a hole in the spaceship—just like Scully’s informants claimed. Later the Barnett story was mistakenly linked by Moore and Friedman to the Roswell incident, though Barnett’s site was located over 150 miles from the Roswell site on the wrong side of the State of New Mexico, and they eventually admitted the linkage to Roswell was probably a mistake. 32 A TV broadcast called “UFO Cover Up – Live” was aired on October 14, 1988, and it is most notable for the preposterous claim that aliens are fond of strawberry ice cream and Tibetan music (the latter a throwback to the Chinese music in the Scully hoax 33 ). Doty actually still defends the strawberry ice cream and Tibetan music beloved of aliens, as well as Project Aquarius! 34 Collins and Doty (with Timothy Cooper) published a book with many such extraordinarily wild claims, and a whole host of new wacko assertions. On July 1, 1989, Moore lectured before an audience for the annual MUFON Symposium in Las Vegas, Nevada. He described himself as an unpaid government agent who willingly participated in an AFOSI operation that fed false information about aliens to Paul Bennewitz to discredit him. Already mentally unstable to begin with, Bennewitz was by Moore’s admission pushed over the edge because of the fake UFO data. Moore shocked his audience of fellow UFO researchers by revealing that he had spied on them and passed along data about them to AFOSI. Moore claimed that four other ufologists he refused to name were performing a similar service for AFOSI. Some “people even stumbled out of the lecture hall, gripped by a combination of shock, anguish and tears.” 35 Moore refused to answer questions after the talk and quickly left the audience in a tumult from his revelations. In 1989-91 a number of lengthy investigations of MJ-12 were published by ufologists Robert Hastings, Moore and Shandera (who had split with Friedman by this time), Friedman, and MUFON researchers T. Scott Crain and Grant Cameron. Entire books on MJ-12 were published in the subsequent decade by Friedman (1996), the MJ-12-skeptical Kevin Randle (2002), Bishop (2005), and Collins and Doty (2005), without ultimately resolving the tangled web of lies and confusing array of issues, and without authenticating a single page of MJ-12 documentation in question. 30 Stringfield, MUFON 1978 Symposium Crash/Retrieval paper, p.79, emphasis added. 31 Forthcoming research.

He was the cofounder of Citizens Against UFO Secrecy (CAUS) and also of the BlueBookArchive.org . Conclusions There is the ultimate question to consider now: Why has the AF demonstrated such a long-running pattern of animosity towards ufology? Is it because the AF is protecting a supersecret? Is it the “holy grail” of a recovered alien spaceship and alien bodies? Do ufologists pose a threat to the AF’s cover-up of this greatest secret of all time by their efforts to penetrate the veil of secrecy? Or was the AF hostility to UFO activists due to Cold War fears that the Soviets could exploit UFO reports? The Soviets, it was feared, could claim UFOs to be Soviet secret weapons flying over American cities—perhaps carrying Soviet atom bombs they might say—which the American AF was impotent to stop. TOP SECRET Air Force documents tell of AF worries that the US nuclear advantage actually could be wiped out by a clever Soviet propaganda campaign along those lines. There is a policy document trail supporting the existence of such Cold War fears in 1947-1950 and their presentation for action to highly sensitive intelligence and covert operations agencies. If the subject of UFOs could be discredited in the public mind with the “giggle factor” this threat could be stopped, or so the Cold War planners might have reasoned. If AF disinformation agents secretly promoted laughable crashed saucer and little green men stories, then if and when such Soviet propaganda claims were ever made the American public would laugh it all off. Soviet saucer claims would be dismissed by everyone as silly season stories and shoved under the “ridicule curtain.” But ufologists would then have to be squelched because they could upset the applecart, piercing through the ridicule curtain by crediting UFOs in the public mind instead of discrediting them as the cold warriors wanted. An initially Cold War-inspired series of independent AF and CIA disinformation operations against the UFO subject seems to have gradually transformed into operations to protect bureaucratic missions against interference by UFO groups and activists. 36 Could it be all of the above? It is extremely unlikely that holders of supersecret proof of alien visitation would share that all-important secret with security agencies such as AFOSI. As Moore recognized in his discussions with Pratt, the disinformation “people wouldn’t have to know there was anything to hide.” It would be a gross violation of every principle of security and compartmentalization to protect secrets by sharing the secrets with low-level security people. AFOSI had no “need to know” such a supersecret and could perform its job of protecting it without knowing it. It could simply carry out orders from above without questioning why. Security officers guarding the wartime Manhattan Project, for example, did not need to know the secret of the atomic bomb in order to carry out their duties to protect that secret. Just because AFOSI protects the AF’s turf against ufologist challengers does not mean AFOSI is doing it to hide a supersecret. That said, however, I must admit from my highly skeptical research that in 1949 AFOSI was almost certainly responding to Roswell—for very compelling reasons I cannot get into here—and there is in fact some weak, circumstantial evidence suggesting that it was a classic Roswell cover-up scenario, not a Cold War counter-Soviet operation. As a friendly skeptic, if I find UFO or other evidence for the extraterrestrial hypothesis (ETH) even though I do not believe it, I will still report it, to be fair. I am open to solid scientific evidence for ETH; I just have not been convinced by any that has been put forth, for reasons too lengthy to go into here. I say this as a lifelong UFO skeptic of ETH and as a Roswell skeptic. The evidence convinces me that UFOs represent an unexplained phenomenon yet to be defined scientifically.

An abbreviated version of the paper is being published in the Journal in two parts: the first half was in the September issue, and the second half appears in this issue of the Journal on pages 3–11. The full paper can be read at www.mufon.com . By Stanton Friedman I had been warned by an associate that I wouldn’t like Brad Sparks’ and Barry Greenwood’s MUFON 2007 paper “The Secret Pratt Tapes and the Origins of MJ-12.” I had tried to get a copy in advance, so as to be able to respond to any questions I would be asked at the Symposium, as sort of theRoswell/MJ-12 expert. I was unable to get a copy, so I was prepared for the worst. Both Brad and Barry had been active in ufology for decades. The paper is indeed unique being the longest (66 pages) and having the most footnotes (126) of any MUFON paper I can recall. That is, of course, far too long for an hour or so presentation, though Brad used no visuals. Brad made clear he was opposed to the Extraterrestrial Hypothesis and the reality of both Roswell and Majestic 12. He gave tantalizing hints that he may have found some undisclosed information allowing for possible Roswell reality. He didn’t deal with the enormous evidence available. His main focus was on the newly released information in the papers from the late journalist, Robert Pratt. These had been donated to MUFON and had been scanned as part of the Pandora Project. Of particular interest were the transcripts of tapes of Bob’s conversations with William Moore and with Rick Doty, Bill’s insider contact with the US Air Force Office of Special Investigations. Brad’s thesis seems to be that since Moore passed on everything to Doty that he and I learned from our Roswell research, that Doty just fed it back as phony documents. For example, he tried to dismiss the Eisenhower Briefing Document (EBD) as just an emulation of an earlier Aquarius document that is phony, stressing that Aquarius talked about Jesus having been left on Earth though there is no mention of this in the EBD. No direct comparisons are given. He claims that the Cutler Twining (CT) memo of July 14, 1954, is just an emulation of a memo Bill Moore and I had found at the Library of Congress Manuscript Division (LCMD) in the papers of General Nathan Twining during an early visit. This claim frankly seems absurd. The MJ-12 related Cutler Twining memo, on Dictation onionskin made by Fox paper, is only 6 lines long, is not signed and there is no /s/ (indicating original signed by). It does have “Subject: NSC/ MJ-12 Special Studies Project.” The earlier July 13, 1953, memo from Cutler to Twining about an all day meeting at the White House on July 16, 1953, is 19 lines long, has no “SUBJECT” and is signed. The only common item is “your concurrence in the above change of arrangements is assumed,” the last sentence on CT. The last sentence in the surely genuine memo is, “In order to avoid communication on this subject, it is understood that in the absence of contrary word your concurrence in the above arrangements is assumed.” I had already pointed this out in my “Final Report on Operation Majestic 12.” Brad tries to make a big deal about my comments about similarity, hardly the same as emulation. The security classifications are different as is much else. Brad neglects to mention that while, yes, I had noted the similarity when Bill called the day he and Jamie Shandera discovered the CT, he doesn’t mention that in a conversation with William McVey (Twining’s pilot and aide for many years) he noted—when I asked about it—that this was standard phraseology indicating that no response was needed. I certainly wouldn’t have addressed a 4-star general that way. The similarity of this one sentence is an indication of genuineness not fakery. I had noted a number of real emulations in the Tim Cooper phony MJ-12 documents as I reported in the 2 nd edition of TOP SECRET/MAJIC and in Majestic 12 Update as posted on my website. Brad doesn’t reference these two sources despite all his references. The real emulations were documents which were very similar and involved retyping with important but small changes of original documents available in books, not in a folder at the LCMD (CT was found at the National Archives) with scanning or Xeroxing of the hand written portions. Placed side by side, it is clear that one is an emulation of the other. The CT memo is definitely NOT an emulation of the July 13, 1953, memo. It also has a very interesting slant red pencil mark through the very unusual security marking of TOP SECRET RESTRICTED. (The early one has a conventional rubber stamped TOP SECRET.) The red pencil mark was standard practice when a document was to be declassified. I found this out years later. The earlier letter has no red pencil. Why add it and how did they know? It has no signature or /s/.. How did Doty know not to use one? Cutler was out of the country so couldn’t have signed it. How did Doty know that, when it wasn’t discovered until later? It was years later that the GAO discovered a number of examples of the odd security marking. Brad mentions a list of Continued on page 13"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"      13 MUFON UFO Journal October 2007 10 comments expressing concerns about the CT memo by Joanne Williamson at the National Archives, but seems unaware of the fact that she had to change a number of these when I pointed out errors. For example, she had noted that there was no NSC meeting scheduled for July 16 as supposedly indicated by the CT memo. In fact, it only talks of an already scheduled meeting and does not say NSC meeting. She claimed that the Eisenhower Library had said all of Cutler’s onionskin carbons were on a certain kind of onion skin. However, during a visit to the Ike Library, I had noted several kinds of onion skin paper used for carbons, so that was also changed. Brad’s dismissal of the EBD is equally shallow, besides his unsupported allegation that it is just the Aquarius document in mufti. He claims the fatal error is that the EBD says the distance to the crash site was “approximately 75 miles northwest of Roswell Army Air Base” when the driving distance on one route was 102 miles and the GPS distance is about 62 miles. Why would Hillenkoetter (briefing officer) use the word approximately if he was trying to be precise? Obviously it didn’t matter. Furthermore there was an airplane landing strip located at a gas line pumping station not too far from the site and there were lots of small Piper Cubs at the base which would undoubtedly have been used to get people out there in a hurry. Approximately 75 miles would appear to be a good rounded off number. His second equally questionable concern is the line “Numerous examples of what appear to be a form of writing were found in the wreckage. Efforts to decipher these have remained largely unsuccessful.” He leaves out the next item (“See attachment E”). He then points out that since I had later found out from my visits to the Menzel papers at Harvard in 1986 that Menzel had taught cryptography and learned Japanese, the document if genuine should have said the deciphering was done under Dr. Menzel. He claims since Doty et al hadn’t been passed this info by Moore until later, that is why Menzel isn’t mentioned. How can Brad know why people do what they do and who is telling the truth and what is in unseen documents such as attachment E? Surely that would have gone into detail about the deciphering and presumably Menzel’s role. Careful review of the EBD finds 6 instances of (See Attachment B, or C, etc). In all of these no name is mentioned. When Bronk and Menzel are mentioned there is no “(See Attachment__).” So briefer Hillenkoetter was tidy and consistent. It seems strange that Brad doesn’t take note of the fact that the EBD notes that “on 07 July, 1947, a secret operation was begun to assure recovery of the wreckage.” But I didn’t determine that Twining had indeed gone to New Mexico on July 7 until much later from both his and his aide’s flight logs. I listed more than 20 facts not known until later. He has also ignored them. Does his anti-Roswell and anti-MJ-12 bias interfere with his objectivity? Brad makes a big deal about the ongoing battle between the Army and Air Force vs. the Navy. He doesn’t mention that the National Security Agency provided a home for Army, Navy and Air Force personnel and that the 12 original MJ-12 members included 2 Army, 2 Navy, 2 Air Force as well as five scientists and the Secretary of Defense. Three of these were Directors of the Central Intelligence Agency. He makes a big deal about battles between NASA (he stressesthat it is a civilian agency) and the military groups. There is no mention of the fact that NASA has sponsored lots of classified work and that it was the direct result of military concerns about the military impact of the Soviet Sputnik in 1957.The Russians had much more technology than we had given them credit for, such as long distance rockets and sophisticated electronics. NASA was a direct outgrowth of the old National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) which was heavily involved in military R and D and has conducted loads of classified research. There seems to have been a disagreement between Brad and Barry about claims that documents were faked just to make money for Moore, Doty, and maybe Pratt, who would work with Moore on a fiction book about MJ-12 with Doty as a kind of silent partner. (The fiction book was never published.) Brad took much of this out of the paper because of fear of libel charges. He also claimed that Pratt had secretly taped his conversations with Moore, Doty, etc. Mrs. Pratt, who was in Denver to accept a posthumous award for Bob for his outstanding UFO journalism, was very upset at the use of the term “secretly” and Brad provided no evidence that the other party was unaware of Bob’s taping. Bob kept copious notes and openly taped as much as he could, not surprisingly, considering his skills as a journalist and his consistent effort to be accurate. Brad apparently believes that, since there is a dearth of official documents so far relating to Roswell and/or MJ_12, they must not have been real. The old absence of evidence is evidence for absence ploy. This is somewhat surprising since he is the one who picked out the FBI memo about Roswell from the 1500 plus pages of FBI material obtained under FOIA by Bruce Maccabee. One would think there still weren’t literally tons of classified material that haven’t seen the light of day. There are. There are many tidbits that I believe are false such as claiming that an associate of Doty provided the MJ-12 document to Tim Good. No evidence is provided. I am reminded of a number of UFO sightings in which the witness can’t separate observation from interpretation.

Submit articles to: Editor@MUFON.com Sally Petersen, Editor 888-817-2220 A recent email from a New Mexico MUFON member regarding OPUS’ role in experiencer investigations vis-a-vis MUFON, prompted Les Velez, liasion between MUFON and OPUS, to clarify that role. – James Carrion, MUFON Director Hi James, There is definitely a misunderstand- ing of what OPUS’ role is with MUFON. Daniel has asked some good questions and I will try to clarify as best I can. My comments appear below following of the questions from Daniel. Daniel: How will this affect the CMS ranking? If an abductee notifies MUFON, and OPUS takes the case; New Mexico will not have access to this information due to confidentiality. Les: OPUS will not “take the case” [in terms of the investigation], our only goal is to help the person [find] access to a support group or therapist. I will institute immediately a policy of advis- ing the state director and the “experi- encer” of the desire of MUFON to investigate that person’s event if they so desire. Daniel: Since New Mexico is “out of the loop,” then who handles Physi- cal Evidence? OPUS or MUFON’s investigators? Les: New Mexico will not be out of the loop—see previous response. Daniel: Concerning Physical Evidence: will OPUS need help from local investigators? If so, then how would we know what to look for if OPUS can’t give us information? Les: Again, I refer to the first an- swer. Again, the goal is to help people. They will be advised of MUFON’s request and will be urged to contact the state director as well. Daniel: Networking with other organizations: What policy is there to prevent another organization from sharing and/or selling an abductee’s personal information? If a problem arises, then who gets sued? OPUS, MUFON, or the other organization? Les: What was meant by network- ing is involved with the process of finding more qualified people familiar with the “abduction / experiencer” phenomenon. We still lack therapists in many areas and filling the gaps will be an on-going process. Daniel: Who pays the Abduction Therapists for the Abductee? Many therapists charge $100 or more per session and usually require multiple sessions. Les: After a referral is made, the payment process is left up to the experiencer and the therapist. Some therapists work on a sliding scale to thus make it easier for those that do not have the financial wherewithal. Daniel: If New Mexico is already investigating an abduction case, will OPUS be allowed to take the case away from local investigators? Les: OPUS has no right to “take a case away” and it is not our intention to do so. OPUS is a resource for investi- gators that run into situations (and this needs to be discussed further with regard to investigator training) where they may need assistance per our mission. Daniel: What if the abductee is a local Investigator, Director, etc.? Will this MUFON member be forced to comply with OPUS? If this member refuses, will it result in disciplinary action? Les: Again, if a person needs the kind of help that we offer, we help make it available, and no one is forced to do anything. I hope this makes things clearer. I’m available to answer more questions anytime.

Free at www.alienjigsaw.com. Reviewed by Dwight Connelly This is the most recent of a series of publications by a long-time abductee. Her first book was The Alien Jigsaw (1994), followed quickly by The Alien Jigsaw Researcher’s Supplement , then a four-page self-help guide called Puzzle Pieces . The current book, which is offered free on the Internet, covers the most recent 12 years of the author’s life. Those who have read The Alien Jigsaw will find this latest book to be similar, although the author is describing numerous new episodes. Ms. Wilson’s reported experiences are like Betty Hill or Betty Andreason Luca on steroids. Abductees who read this book will probably feel that their remembered experiences are quite mild in comparison to the author’s. It is difficult to know whether to call the episodes described by Ms. Wilson abductions or visions. As in The Alien Jigsaw , a very broad range of “experiences” are described, including at least four types of aliens, possible military abductions, hybrids, alien writing, shape shifting, life force transfer, chemical labs, rape, accidental remote viewing, implants, an amnesiac drug, possible movement through time, possible movement into other dimensions, learning how to levitate material objects, “trigger” words, visions of the future, and much more. All of this is “recalled” by the author without hypnosis, which is quite unusual in abduction cases. While some of her abductions—as evidenced by physical damage to her body—are not recalled, she appears to remember much more than the aliens expect. At one point an alien reportedly says to another alien, “Katharina continues to be a problem...she is remembering too much.” Finding proof that these various encounters or visions actually took place is impossible. However, there are strong indications that Ms. Wilson is an abductee, based on the conclusions of such reliable researchers as Budd Hopkins, as well as reported physical damage to her body. In addition, there are statements from her husband, Eric, who has not only witnessed the author’s struggles, but also reportedly has experienced abductions himself. One of the strangest topics, and “one of the main reasons I felt compelled to write another book,” is a major upcoming war. Or is it wars? Somehow the dates 2012, 2020, and 2040 seem to be important. In a vision reportedly experienced in 1995 Ms. Wilson sees a nuclear war, with bombs hitting both the U.S. and Russia, but the attacker is China, “and it will be a war over oil.” But in July of 1997 she was again reportedly shown a vision of the future in which Earth will be attacked by alien craft emerging from another dimension through a “slit-like hole in space.” The aliens will reportedly attack Israel first, then Northern Europe, then the U.S.—a somewhat strange sequence. Ms. Wilson says that in 2004 she had another vision of the future which involved aliens attacking humans, who “will be marginalized and will be nothing more than numbers...just bodies and fodder in the fight against these aliens.” In another vision in July, 2006, the Earth is again destroyed. “Pockets of civilization will survive, but they will be the people who are removed prior to the war. Everyone who stays behind will die. We will have to start a new civilization.” Later that same month was the final (thus far) vision. “We will have to hide who we really are and we have to become like the enemy so we will not be killed.” In this vision the two aliens providing this information show extreme sadness in making this telepathic report. They are greys, but different. They have very white skin, and the female has red hair. She is crying, and this concern for humanity is reportedly “the reason I decided to write this book.” The cover of this book, in fact, features a drawing by Ms. Wilson of this alien female crying. Thus, as pointed out in other parts of the book, there are good aliens (especially the Blondes) and bad aliens. Some aliens reportedly will attack us, but others will defend us. And there are good hybrids and not so good hybrids. Toward the end of the book the author, a life-long Democrat, gets into politics, making it plain she has no use for President Bush or most of the mass media. Al Gore is okay. She says, “The war in Iraq was really about keeping the Bush family and their buddies in the oil business rich and seeking revenge against Saddam for trying to assassinate his father.” The author reports that she was told by an alien prior to 9-11 that it would happen, but she was not able to remember it until after the event occurred. “They knew ahead of time that this tragedy—this precursor to a Continued on page 20"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"October 2007 16 MUFON UFO Journal PercePtions PercePtions PercePtions PercePtions PercePtions By Stanton T. Friedman Stanton Friedman Friedman honored; hometown embraces UFOs The Mayor Calls In mid August I received a sur- prise phone call from Brad Woodside, Mayor of the City of Fredericton, New Brunswick, Canada. I have lived in Fredericton since 1980 when my family moved here from Hayward, California, across the bay from San Francisco. Fredericton is a lovely town of about 50,000 people, Capital of the Picture Province of New Brunswick, and home of the University of New Brunswick, the oldest English Language University in Canada. Brad and I have run into each other around town and he has often commented about seeing me on various TV pro- grams. I was frankly shocked when he asked if it would be okay for him and the City Council of Fredericton to proclaim Monday, August 27, “Stanton Friedman Day, to honour you and your career as a physicist and your noto- riety as a UFO expert.” A proclama- tion would be issued at the city council meeting that evening. As a long time booster of Fredericton, I of course agreed. Both Brad and I sell Fredericton at every opportunity. I could live wherever I wanted to do what I am doing and yet I have remained in Fredericton for 27 years. The previous 27 years since leaving New Brunswick (New Jersey) I lived in seven different areas of the US, mostly chasing cancelled advanced research and development programs sponsored by the US government while working for such companies as GE, GM, Westinghouse. Of course I said yes. Who could turn down having a day proclaimed in his name? I should stress that there was no compensation involved. But the time and energy required would be minimal (I thought), unlike going to California for the Larry King show. (I left home at 4:45 AM on July 13 and returned at midnight July 14.) My pay was a Larry King mug. Since the program was repeated at least three times, I guess one could say I got a million dollars worth of free publicity. It also helped sell my new book CAPTURED! The Betty and Barney Hill UFO Experience by myself and Kathleen Marden, who is Betty’s niece and did most of the work. We both have been doing a host of tele- phone radio interviews The Press Covers the News The Fredericton Daily Gleaner newspaper had already done an article about my then forthcoming Larry King appearance and also one about signing copies of CAPTURED at the local Chapters Book store (like “Barnes and Noble” or “Borders”). I felt it made more sense to tell Chris Morris, the local journalist for the Canadian Press, about the SF Day as she had done a couple of excellent articles about me and UFOs in years gone by. She interviewed both Brad and myself, and her article went out on CP on Sunday, August 26. My wife and I had been in Moncton, New Brunswick, about 100 miles away that weekend visiting our daughter and came home Monday morning. We each had a bunch of telephone messages. The media were responding very well to the Canadian Press story. I spent almost the entire day doing TV and radio interviews. A couple of days later our neighbor told me that the street (a low traffic crescent) was practically blocked by three different media trucks waiting to do interviews. My wife fortunately was able to act as gatekeeper. The ceremony at the Council Chambers that evening was almost anticlimactic. The proclamation was nicely framed. All the councilmen and women shook my hand. Why we Live in Fredericton I was asked to make some comments, which I did expressing my humility (not an emotion I am well known for) at the honor. I also pointed out that I needed to demolish some rumors that came up with regard to how I wound up in Fredericton. One that, for an unknown reason, has persisted, is that I was chased out of the USA by the FBI because of my UFO activities! Even Allen Hynek had asked me about that. The real story is much simpler. My wife, one of nine children, grew up in New Brunswick. Her parents were still alive when we moved back here after visiting several years in a row. Five of her siblings also live here now. All nine are grand-parents. When we have our annual family reunion there are usually about 60 people present. We had no relatives in California. I did"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"      17 MUFON UFO Journal October 2007 become a citizen of Canada as well as the USA when the USA changed its laws to permit that, so I am a dual citizen American when I cross the border at Houlton, Maine, into the USA and a Canadian citizen when I come back or go overseas. Fredericton is truly a fine city in which to raise a family and we have never regretted the move. A second rumor is that we moved because of the fine Canadian medical system. I still haven’t spent overnight in a hospital here or anywhere else. I did show off the Larry King mug, noting that it was my pay, and with greater gusto showed off my really neat Excellence in Ufology award received at the 38 th Annual MUFON Symposium in Denver on August 11. It is about the same size as an Oscar statuette, and heavy as well, but it is in the form of an alien wearing sneakers and with a cane. I was waiting for it to break into a song and dance. Got in a good plug for MUFON. More Friendly Press Coverage There were more interviews later in the week especially with a reporter from the Saint John Telegraph Journ al (about 70 miles away on the Bay of Fundy with the world’s highest tides). The reporter was planning on a story for the portion of the paper dealing with activities of seniors, he said. The CP story had noted my age was 73. Instead on Saturday on the front page with a 7x10 color picture of me holding a bust of an alien, was a large article (continued on page 2) with the headline “ The Physicist and the Flying Saucers. ” The beginning is “The galaxy’s greatest authority on flying saucers sits...” Nothing like a little exaggeration. And I am always complaining about people saying galaxy when they really mean solar system. Larry King did that. Nary a Debunker What rather surprised me was the absence of countering debunkers, of silliness, of seriously raised eyebrows. Questions included how I wound up in Fredericton, had I ever seen a UFO, why the cover up? I noted that I had never seen a UFO, nor a neutron or a gamma ray, nor Tokyo, though I was convinced that all three were genuine. Did I have any good pictures? At one point videographers from two different stations were shooting footage of an array of my UFO pictures. The SJTJ used three photos on page two from Belotie, Yugoslavia, McMinnville, Oregon and Trinidade, Brazil. All seemed to understand when I explained that I only used old pictures in my lectures because any clever 14- year-old can make a good UFO picture now. Townspeople were Sincerely Interested All during the week I was accosted by people at the supermar- ket, the bank, the busy Saturday morning market, Staples, etc. by people who had seen the articles or the TV interviews or heard the radio broadcasts. All were friendly and congratulatory about “Stanton Friedman Day.” It is as though the friendly press coverage allowed people to be less inhibited about their own beliefs in UFOs. Also they, too, seemed to want to share my pride in Fredericton as a fine place to live. I find it interesting that Fredericton is about the same size as Roswell. Maybe if we establish a UFO museum, the public will beat a path to our door, too? Fredericton does have much more IT activity and a number of world class consulting engineering firms. I have been able to work with some of them on such activities as the commissioning of the Point Lepreau Nuclear Generating station, and studies of the radon problem, waste heat recovery from power plants, the use of electron beams for treatment of flue gas, Future Technology Scenarios for New Brunswick. The UNB Library has been very helpful in my studies on the MJ-12 documents as reported in TOP SECRET/MAJIC , especially with regard to a number of false MJ-12 documents. It certainly helped the family coffers that my younger daughter could live at home and walk to UNB. My older daughter was one of the first deaf people to graduate from Fredericton High School. I never had to worry about either one walking around town, nor about smog, or heavy traffic. Don’t be Afraid to Speak Out I can’t say for sure that the friendly and fair response I received from these media people (not all were hometowners) is related to the growing recognition—based on the incredible response to the Chicago Tribune January 1 article about the O’Hare UFO sighting—that decent honourable people are interested in serious ufology. But I surely want to encourage others not to be as afraid to speak out as they have been in the past. I always stress: have facts in hand before putting mouth in gear. With the internet being what it is, I got nice comments from lots of people I didn’t know and some I did know. One guy made an attack for YouTube claiming that lots of scientists can provide neutrons. I defy him or anybody else to show me one or put one in a bottle. Moral of that story is: don’t expect everybody to accept anything.

The new and much improved site was created by SIU team member Adam Johnson, who is doing a great job keeping the site very current, adding new cases and information as it becomes available. Another sighting of light balls In recent columns I have concen- trated on events involving small light balls. I have a growing interest in such observations as these small devices seem to exhibit either intelligence or most certainly intelligent control. The light ball cases have been increasing over the past ten years. They have been seen to generate physical effects along with electromagnetic effects. They have collided with vehicles and survived to fly away leaving residue or damage, sometimes considerable damage. On September 1, 2007, I received a call at 2058 from the wife of a close friend living in Branson, Missouri, in the Ozarks. She told me of a UFO sighting by her daughter’s boyfriend, Cory, and his family. In the back- ground I could hear the daughter talking by cell phone with Cory as his family was approaching the objects for the second time. The sighting was taking place just 1.8 miles from our home. My wife and I drove imme- diately to the area arriving there at 2106. Nothing was seen but we remained in the area for 30 minutes. At 2047, Cory’s mother, Lisa, and her son Johnny, age 14, were driving home on a secondary road about 10 miles northwest of Branson, Missouri. As they made a curve bearing north- east they saw two brilliant circular lights across a field on their right. The lights were close together and hovering.Lisa saw them through the upper passenger side of the wind- shield. Johnny rolled down the passen- ger side front window and had a clear view. On Figure 1, this location is marked as WITNESSES 1. Lisa slowed the vehicle and drove to a point 500 feet beyond the first sighting where she stopped and turned off the engine and vehicle lights. The lights were hovering directly beyond the right side of the vehicle. This position is indicated as WIT 2 on Branson, Missouri family follows light balls for 13 minutes"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"      19 MUFON UFO Journal October 2007 Figure 2. The first sighting. Figure 3. The second sighting. Figure 1. There was no sound at all; in this remote area even the slightest sound would have been detected. The lights seemed to be above a large tree and double the height of the tree which would be some 80 feet above the ground. (Later I found the inter- secting bearings taken from WIT 1 and WIT 2 indicated a distance from the witnesses to the lights to be 700 feet.) Lights looked the same from every vantage point They stated that the distance between the two lights stayed constant at 5 to 6 feet. The night was very clear and calm and they tried to see a shadow or outline of something behind the lights. They could see nothing that the lights could be attached to. The area behind or around the lights did not black out the brilliant stars. At no time during the observations did they see anything other than the two lights. They estimated the diameter of each light to be much larger than automobile headlights, perhaps 2 feet maximum. Suddenly, the light on the right side elevated slightly and the lights moved rapidly on a bearing of 254 degrees for a distance of 2,200 feet disappearing at that point behind trees. The lights covered that distance in less than 10 seconds. As they traveled that flight path the lights were some 500 feet away and they were looking more at the bottom of the lights and they looked exactly the same as the front view. As the lights moved away they could see the back of the lights, the shape never changed and the distance and attitude of the lights to each other never changed. They had the appearance of two illuminated spheres. They were brilliant but did not hurt the eyes, they did not cast any light on the tree or the ground below. Again, no other lights, no shape, no sound or air disturbance. As Lisa was about to start her car her other son, Cory, age 16, drove up beside her and asked why they were sitting in the middle of the road. They told him what they had seen and he laughed. Then he could see they were serious, they looked in the direction where the lights were last seen and continued home. They drove toward home on the secondary road with many sharp curves, taking 6 to 8 minutes to reach a high hill 2.4 miles from the observation area. As they crested the hill they saw two brilliant white lights ahead and slightly to the left of the road. They could see the lights through the tops of trees to the left and down the road. I found later the lights were 3,300 feet away measuring in a straight line from the hill where they were first seen. This point is indicated as WIT 3. Sighted again 2.4 miles away They drove faster with Cory following behind in his car. Finally they made a very sharp turn to the left and 700 feet directly ahead they saw the two lights hovering off the right side of the road. Lisa stopped her car 50 feet from the lights while Cory pulled off the right side of the road parallel to the lights and 20 feet from their position. Cory was hanging out the window of the car looking up at the lights which were horizontally 20 feet away and about 100 feet above the ground over a large tree, and less than 10 feet from the southeastern edge of the tree. At this very close point to the lights none Continued on page 20"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"October 2007 20 MUFON UFO Journal of the three witnesses could see any dark surface that the lights could be attached to. They were the same 5 to 6 feet apart, 2 feet in diameter. As Cory looked up at the base of the lights they appeared circular as they had appeared from the front and back. There was no sound and no distur- bance of the air below. There was no disturbance in the tree, the top side being less than 50 feet from the lights. It should be noted that at no time was there any interference with the vehicles even when they were much closer during this second event. Thirty seconds or less after the arrival of the two cars, the lights went from hovering to a very high speed moving away horizontally on a bearing of 305 degrees disappearing behind trees 600 feet away in 2 to 3 seconds. Of interest is what we found in the field over which the lights had first hovered. In the small field, measuring 42 feet x 32 feet, beneath where the hovering lights had been, we found a circular area 9 feet in diameter where the plants and the soil appeared wilted and dehydrated. The area in the center was green and lush. At this point it would not be wise to connect the area to the lights but I did take soil and plant samples for analysis. The soil and plant effects were one foot wide and the soil was completely dry, even though there had been three days Continued from page 19 Phillips: Light balls sighting in the Ozarks war—was going to happen, yet they did nothing to prevent it.” She feels the war and such by-products as the Patriot Act are part of the alien agenda. What to make of all of this? After three decades in ufology, I still do not know very much that is solid. UFOs, yes. Abductions, yes. But I don’t know why. And despite the numerous visions reported in this latest book, the author still does not know for sure whether the military is involved in abductions, the purpose of the hybrid program, or whether the Earth will actually be attacked by aliens—pretty basic stuff. In any case it is obvious that Ms. Wilson is sincere and concerned in reporting what she feels she has experienced—a good person who loves animals and wants to save humanity (except the terrorists). With this in mind, she wrote this latest book not to make money, but to inform. A positive motive for a pretty negative message. Dwight Connelly is the former Editor of the MUFON UFO Journal. Continued from page 15 Book Review of rain which ended the morning of the events and deposited over 5 inches of moisture. The analysis may tell the story. The total time from the first observation to the end of the second was about 13 minutes. They have not seen the lights again to this date. They had no previous UFO sightings. The witnesses are extremely credible; Cory was talking to my friend’s daughter during the last observation. His cell phone has a digital camera but he was so amazed by the appearance of the lights he didn’t think to photograph with the cell in his hand. He mentioned that a number of times.

Con- gratulations to Tracey C. Smith (Kansas), Cheryl Ann Gilmore (South Carolina), Donald R. Burleson (New Mexico) for being 1st, 2nd and 3rd respectively in the month of September. The top 10 State Directors are highlighted in yellow. The report is based on our two measures of UFO Investigation effectiveness: Assigning reports within 72 hours of receipt, and completing all investigations within 90 days of being assigned. The “Assigned” column is a six- month running average of the number of cases assigned within 48 hours divided by the total number of cases received in that six-month period. The “Completed” column is the number of cases completed beginning sixty- two (62) days back and going back six months from there (for a total of eight months back) divided by the total number of cases reported in the same period. The “Weighted Rank” is just the average of the two columns expressed as a percent. State Direcotrs can improve their scores by being sure to assign all cases within 72 hours, and by follow- ing up with their Field Investigators to ensure all reports are completed within 90 days. To be considered complete a report must have been investigated and placed in one of the three com- pleted status codes (Unknown, Hoax or IFO) by the State Director.

Other Phenomena Daylight Saving Time ends on November 26. Meteor Showers South Taurids : The South Taurids will peak on November 4-7. This is a minor meteor shower which will be further weakened by the presence of the full Moon. North Taurids : The North Taurids will peak on November 12. The North Taurids are also a minor meteor shower which will also be diminished by the presence of the full Moon. Leonids : Peaking on Friday, November 17. The Leonids meteor shower is probably the most famous meteor shower of all after the high hourly rates of a few years ago. This shower is the result of the Earth’s passage through the dust and debris left by the comet 55P/Tempel-Tuttle. Comet 55P/Tempel- Tuttle returns to the inner solar system every 33 years. Each time it passes through our part of the solar system, it leaves a trail of dust along its path. These small grains of dust become the bright and beautiful meteors in our skies. In 2006 the Leonids will certainly not be at meteor storm levels, but there is a reasonably good chance we’ll see somewhat higher than average hourly rates, as many as 150 per hour, due to the Earth’s passage through a dust stream left during Comet 55P/Tempel- Tuttle’s 1932 passage through the inner Solar System. Fortunately the Moon will not interfere with observation this year. Zodiacal Light Zodiacal light will be visible in northern latitudes in the East before the start of morning twilight from October 20 to November 3. The phenomenon is only visible from very dark locations. Zodiacal light is sunlight bouncing off dust grains in our solar system. These grains lie mostly in the plane of the solar system. Look for a pyramid of light in the morning sky somewhat in appearance to the light from a city or town just over the horizon.
