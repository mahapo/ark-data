Their responses follow. O n Friday morning, July 4th at 9:OOAM, a press conference was held at the Pearson Auditorium, in Roswell, New Mexico. Dr. Russell VernonClark from the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of California, San Diego, ex- plained to a surprised, overflowing audience of about three hundred representatives of the media and local townsfolk, that his re- search proved once and for all material be- lieved to be from the crash site of a UFO in July of 1947, was composed of materials not of this world. He went on to present the scientific data proving his case. He also stated that he had obtained this material from an organization called The Fund for Interactive Research in Space Technology (F.I.R.S.T.), by way of the organization's founders, Dr. Roger Leir and Derrel Sims. The materials were given to him as part of a double blind study to determine scientifi- cally what the substance was composed of. The team of Sims and Leir told him they also had other material believed to be from UFO crash sites being analyzed by other laboratories. The conference was opened by a brief in- troduction by Michael Lindemann from CNI News. He in turn introduced Paul Davids, producer of the Emmy nominated motion picture. \"Roswell.\" Davids pre- sented the chronology and history of the Roswell incident. Upon completion of his presentation he introduced Mr. Sims who thanked his co-founder and director of re- search. Dr. Roger Leir, Hollywood Producer Chris Wyatt, and Dr. Jessie Marcel Jr. He then, introduced Dr. Clark and Dr. Marcel, who told the audience that when shown the material by Sims and Leir, he recognized it as almost the same as some of the material he personally handled in 1947. The press conference was organized by Abrams-Rubaloff & Lawrence of Los Angeles, California.

The media's anger is understand- able. However, this press confer- ence was to inform the public of an amazing dis- covery that was made by mainstream science. That was all, noth- ing more. September 1997 Number 353 Page 4 Present on stage were Derrel Sims, Dr. Roger Leir, Dr. Jessie Marcel, and TV pro- ducers Paul Davids and Chris Wyatt. The press conference ended abruptly af- ter Dr. Clark's presentation in accordance with the planning of the PR firm. The par- ticipants were quickly ushered off the stage, out a back entrance and into a waiting car. Only Paul Davids was left to field questions from the media. The result was confusion and a partial hostile press who openly voiced their dis- may relating to the lack of opportunity to ask questions of the principals. When producer Wyatt was asked about the success of the event, he told reporters that he was pleased with the coverage re- ceived and was only disappointed because this event was completely overshadowed by the Mission to Mars. Despite this, he stated that a headline appeared in the Albuquerque Journal, and also articles in the Roswell Record, The Washington Post, and AP and UP wire services. The event was also car- ried on CBS, ABC. MSNBC, and the Fox Network. — Roger K. Leir E ach day across America, hundreds of press conferences are held to expressly inform the media of occurrences and infor- mation that are deemed valuable to the pub- lic. In turn, it is the media's responsibility to inform the public in a responsible and timely manner. As a member of the media for the past ten years, I have covered over a thousand press conferences ranging the gamut in terms of genres. In all, it has been my expe- rience, and it is the accepted norm, that at least 40% of all press conferences do not have a question and answer session. It is common practice for a police depart- mentor even the White House to hold a press conference and not take questions from the media. It happens every day in al- most every major city. As nationally evi- dent in the JonBenet Ramsey case, not one of the numerous press conferences held by the Boulder police has allowed for a true Q&A with the media. Our case is somewhat similar. We held a press conference and did not have a Q&A session. This was my sole decision. And of course, the media was upset. However, I do not blame them for their anger. But there is something far more important than 10-sec- ond sound bites here. The media's anger is understandable. However, this press conference was to in- form the public of an amazing discovery that was made by mainstream science. That was all, nothing more. This is the first time in history that a sci- entist from a major university has made an announcement of this nature. In fact, this is the first time ever that a discovery of this nature has been made and carefully docu- mented by the scientific community. As I'm sure your readers are aware, Dr. Russell VernonClark made the announce- ment on July 4th in Roswell. However, what your readers do not know is that Dr. VernonClark is one of a number of main- stream scientists that have performed labo- ratory tests on this material. Astonishingly, all the conclusions point to two specific as- pects, the material is extraterrestrial in ori- gin and should be considered manufactured. Dr. VernonClark took the initiative and had the courage to go public with this infor- mation. Without his foresight, this informa- tion would still remain a secret and your readers would have no idea of the scientific evidence that mainstream science has in its possession. Due to the press conference, the other scientists involved in the testing will be go- ing public with their laboratory test results. At that time, we will assemble a panel of scientists and take questions from the me- dia. It would have been unfair to have the me- dia, all 200 of them present at Roswell, to be unleashed on Dr. VernonClark. First, he presented his and other scientists' test data at the conference. Since he has a Ph.D. in Chemistry, he is not qualified to discuss the"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL -=----=_ --.-r=^ CNINeuis - The Hrtifact =^r-~: iscm com/CNI_Ar«ifact Html Silver Isotopic Ratio Comparison: Silver Data ICP/MS DSil>/er106 91 QSilver 108.90 20 40 60 Sample Composition by Isotope 80 100 (Note.

Once again this is a significant difference from the terrestrial silver isotopes tests that were conducted by other scientist to determine the method of manufacturing and other aspects of this material. Now that he had the courage to come forward, the other scientists are willing to speak publicly. If you have been following this story you no doubt are aware of the misinformation and misrepresentations already made by the media. Cases in point are both the Associated Press and the Albuquerque Journal articles. The facts in this case have been so irre- sponsibly reported by the media that the Associated Press had to publish a national retraction and correction. The media has distorted the truths of this case and at times it seems there is an organized effort to dis- credit these findings. In my decade of expe- rience as a member of the media, I have never seen anything like it. I hate to imagine what would have hap- pened had we held a Q&A session at Roswell. We would have had 200 unin- formed members of the media, without any scientific backgrounds, asking questions and making assertions that would have been grossly inappropriate and inaccurate. The story would have been mired in confusion and would have died there in Roswell. All along it has been our intention to bring this material out to the public in the most credible and candid manner possible. As I'm sure your readers will agree with me, this information and its implication are very important. Full disclosure needs to be made public at the right time and in the right venue. It would not have been fair to Dr. VernonClark. the laboratory findings, the other scientists or the public to let the media at Roswell run with the story. We accomplished what we set out to do. For the first time in history, the story is out there. The next step is full disclosure, which will come before the end of the year. All I can say is, stay tuned. — Chris Wyatt Producer, Los Angeles From the CNI News online report of the Roswell frag- ment.

September 1997 Number 353 Page 6 \"Same Night\" flbductions E ver since claims of UFO abductions first emerged, the question has been asked whether they have any basis other than dreams or fantasies of individual abductees. This question is basic to any serious discus- sion of the topic. The purpose of this letter is to suggest a new approach that, with luck, might yield an answer. (In what follows, the words abduction and abductee should be regarded as abbre- viations for \"abduction-type experience\" and \"person experiencing apparent abduc- tion\" respectively, with no interpretation im- plied.) In recent years, one of us (RW) investi- gated a community of abductees who have a high abduction rate, some once a week or more. This group of abductees is located around a small community in Michigan near the Ohio border. We are not sure how large the group is, but it includes at least 20 peo- ple that we know about. The group is cen- tered on a female abductee we will call \"Judy,\" who has been our principal infor- mant on the night-time events. Judy has been regressed about some of her experi- ences, but her conscious memory of many of the events is far greater than that of most abductees. The group had assembled ini- tially after a neighbor of Judy's, who edited the local weekly newspaper, placed a notice in the paper inviting responses from persons who thought they might be abductees. She received a large number of responses, and some of the respondents began meeting to- gether to share their experiences and feel- ings. There was a lot to share. Besides their high frequencies, the variety and strange- ness of the experiences and aftereffects re- ported would rank high in any comparison with other abduction cases. In the course of a conversation (with WK), Judy remarked that she and others had experienced a gap of several weeks without abductions, followed by a resump- tion of activity. The morning after her first post-gap abduction, she had calls from sev- eral others in the group reporting the same thing. Such synchronization, of course, is not what one would expect if the abduc- tions represented independent mental events. (Other accounts we heard also pointed toward multiple abductions on the same nights.) This consideration led to the idea that the simple procedure of having each member of the group of abductees keep an indepen- dent log of his or her experiences might yield important results. If abduction reports from separate households consistently fell on the same dates, this would be convinc- ing evidence that they stemmed from a common cause external to the individual abductees, and not from dreams or fan- tasies. Unfortunately this suggestion did not emerge until the abductees had largely ceased to interact as a group, and it could not be carried out. Our disappointment at the missed opportunity can be imagined. Rather than letting the whole matter drop, however, it seems worthwhile to ask whether there is any possibility of applying the same ideas elsewhere. At this point we should pause and con- sider just what made this particular line of investigation seem attractive. We envi- sioned the data resulting from the study be- ing displayed in a two-way table with columns corresponding to participants and rows to dates. If a subject's log showed an apparent abduction on a given date, a mark would be entered in the corresponding cell of the table. The question of interest would be whether marks were clustered in certain rows rather than being scattered at random. This should be apparent to the eye, but in any event could be tested statistically. (It is, of course, important that the logs be kept in- dependently; ideally, each apparent abduc- tion would be reported to a central registry on the day it occurred.) The key point is that the table of data would speak for itself, with little room for subjective interpretation. If there was a clear clustering of reports on certain dates, conclusions could be drawn without the need for rehashing the usual endless arguments about the extent to which abductees' accounts are the products of their own minds. For such a clustering would require some causative agent operat- ing simultaneously on all the involved ab- ductees on the dates in question. It is impor- tant to note, however, that the nature of the agent would remain a completely open question. This approach could be pursued if an- other group of abductees could be identified sharing this characteristic of the one dis- cussed above. We have no magic formula for doing this, but will venture a few sug-"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL for doing this, but will venture a few sug- gestions. • A scan of Dan Wright's abduction data base might indicate the frequency of ab- duction reports exhibiting the desired characteristics, and might even provide some leads to promising cases. • As noted, the group discussed above was assembled by advertising in a local weekly newspaper, netting numerous . replies. Perhaps the same tactic would work again. • Abductees often report seeing other ap- parent abductees sharing the abduction. A case of this type, upon further investi gallon, might provide the kind of data we are looking for. • Many abductees are already gathered into groups that meet for mutual support and discussion. It might be worthwhile for the members of such a group to start keeping logs to see whether there were any signs of concurrent abductions. - Wilfred Kincaid & Ron UJestrum From George A. Filer MUFON Eastern Director Majorstar@aol.com Some of the following cases have been in- vestigated. Others represent only raw data at this time. NEW JERSEY (Case 97/8/6) David Stein, a computer expert was driving home late from work on the Garden State Parkway, when he saw blue circular lights low over the highway. At approximately 10:00 p.m., his and other cars started slowing near the Hazlet exit about twenty miles south of New York City. The bright blue lights were not blinking, but seemed to contract and expand in intensity. causing traffic to stop and look at the amaz- ing sight. The UFO moved up and down and to the left and the right of the roadway. David believes other drivers must have seen the low flying craft, because so many cars stopped on the heavily traveled highway. The craft appeared as a disc about three inches in diameter at arm's length. David estimated its actual size was much larger than an automobile. After the traffic stopped, the bright blue lights suddenly flew off to the west between some trees at high speed and then traffic resumed. David Stein was very shaken by the sighting. He said, \"I'd always been a skeptic about UFOs, but not any more. I feel no helicopter or other craft could perform those maneuvers.\" Further investigation is continuing. GEORGIA (Case 97/2/20) John Thompson, GA State Director has finished the investigation of a sighting over La Grange. The witness, a mechanic, saw four bright white lights in the Northeast sky. Each light was larger than Venus and formed a rectangle that stood 45 degrees above the horizon. He slowed his vehicle to obtain a better look and his truck lights angled up on a hill. The four separate lights suddenly merged at in- stantaneous speed and then flew almost straight up. The lights were like spotlights, brighter and larger than anything the wit- ness had ever seen in the sky, except for the sun or moon. Total viewing time was over a minute. The exact date'of the sighting is unknown, but occurred in the second half of February of this year. FLORIDA (Case 97/6/17) Jean and Eugene Brown, MUFON State Section Directors, and field investigators Carol Hammond and Polly Bryer have finished the investigation of a Tampa daylight sighting. Olga Booker, the primary witness, was driving home at 11:20 a.m. when she spotted what she at first thought was a blimp with red and white lights. She then realized it was not blimp and started to follow in her car. The object, which looked like a heavy iron pot, was moving slowly from the south to north low over some trees and buildings. The object was pyramid-shaped, with one side slightly curved, and with three pulsating orange to red-colored lights on each comer. There was September 1997 Number 353 Page?"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL September 1997 Number 353 Pages also a series of white twinkling lights on the UFO. About thirty lights were on the rear curved portion of the car-sized object. It was flat like a pancake and had no wings, tail, or windows. It was a dark green/grey/brown color. It had scratch or grain-like lines run- ning left to right that reflected a copper or gold-like color on its surface. Two male wit- nesses also saw the object. One looked at the UFO and said, \"What is it?\" It flew off to the east at high speed. The object was sighted just a few miles north of MacDill Air Force Base and com- ing from that direction. The Air Force said it wasn't theirs. Olga appeared on local TV showing a drawing she made of the craft. KENTUCKY A Mr. Hutch, age 24, reports sighting two UFOs at 12:20 a.m., August 12, 1997 near Buffalo, in central Kentucky. He and his wife saw two objects moving directly over- head at a high altitude, but too far away to tell the size or shape. They looked like stars, but were moving fast in random pat- terns. They moved too fast for normal air- craft, and too erratic for meteors. They both seemed to be moving at same time, but not in the same formation or direction. It was a warm, dark night, there was a slight mist in the air and storms were fore- cast. The craft darted around the sky for 15 minutes. The sighting took place near an ur- ban area, where there is an air route close by. TEXAS On the evening of Friday, July 25, 1997, Cliff S. and his young son were in their pickup truck going west on Farm Road 1488 in eastern Texas, when they saw some- thing unusual in the sky. In their farm county, Cliff explained, he was used to see- ing air traffic traveling between Dallas and Houston in a north-south direction, so when a strange object appeared in the west- ern sky, he took notice. \"It seemed to hang in the sky and not move, so we watched it for a while. I reached back and got my binoculars (which) I'd left in the truck since the (Hale-Bopp) comet, and pulled over. I looked at it. It was about the size of an airliner, but much closer. I could see a faint gleam of a cockpit in the middle, with window panes. I was having a weird feeling, such as I remember having as a kid whenever I'd seen unusual things in the sky.\" Cliff's son took the binoculars and con- firmed the sighting. Then Cliff watched and said, \"Now that I realized that they were very close, I couldn't hear any sound. I turned off the truck engine to hear better, and we both got out. It was just overhead, but the only sound around it was like its wings cutting through the air. Directly over- head!...we couldn't see the outline, but it seemed triangular. It was black or dark. No red lights visible from below. A pair of white lights close together, side by side...then another pair behind it, less bright, then another pair, bright again, at the rear. They also had two bright white spotlights at the tip of each wing. It seemed to be fol- lowing our (farm) road to the east, and would slowly bank to one side, then to the other.\" (Many thanks to Steve Wilson Sr. for this news story.) UFO ROUNDUP #31, Editor Joseph Trainor, Masinaigan@aol.com ARIZONA On 5 Aug. 1997, in Ash Fork, AZ. Wheels Wegener II reports seeing two sets of very bright blue/greenish lights. He re- ports, \"The lights were hovering over a peak across the valley from where I live, with one American-made chopper with them. The chopper was in the area the day before. One set of lights turns on end, and drops into the top of the mountain, or be- hind it, then conies back up and into hori- zontal formation and all threeleave.\" A couple of days before, a bright silver ball was in the sky moving toward Phoenix. It vanished into a bright blue circle and then the blue circle vanished.

Jacobs Hbstract Since I have been researching the UFO phenome- non, we have had a steady increase in our knowl- edge of it. There have been setbacks, wrong tracts, and enemies, but our understanding of the phenome- non has grown. As the new knowledge accrued, we have had to reorder our assumptions and engage in new paradigms to understand the phenomenon. We must continue to work for clarity free from New Age entanglements, upgrade our profession, and en- gage the expertise of others as we enter into the twenty-first century... ...I first became involved with studying UFOs in the mid-1960s while an undergraduate at UCLA. We were both in our youth; the public UFO phenome- non was about eighteen years old and I was twenty- three. I am not sure why I became so interested in flying saucers, perhaps they satisfied a need for fan- tasy in my life. Whatever it was, the subject took hold of my imagination. One of my earliest forays into the UFO world came about when I took my wife and some friends to Frank Stranges' \"Phenomenon 7.7\" convention in Los Angeles in 1966. We sat in the balcony while several speakers talked about UFO sightings and Air Force cover-up. After the intermission, the main event finally came— a film of an actual flying saucer. And there it was on the screen; big, shining, spinning, and splendid. If you squinted hard enough you could al- most avoid seeing the string that suspended the fly- ing saucer. It was all quite embarrassing and by rights I should have given up my interest in UFOs and gone about having a normal life. But in spite of the embarrassment, I was hooked... The Scienfic Community The scientific community was a more difficult area to attend to. We did not realize at the time that the politics of science was so powerful and so all- encompassing, that few scientists would be able to break away from the political constraints of their professions. Ridicule reinforced this encasement and the two worked together to prevent the scien- tific community from engaging productively with the UFO evidence. The scientific community's in- ability to recognize the UFO phenomenon's impor- tance is without doubt the most significant scientific scandal in history, and the UFO research commu- nity's inability to make meaningful inroads into the scientific establishment has constituted its greatest failure to date. This is all the more ironic because important discoveries in astronomy in the past fifty years have lent credence to the idea that life other than ours could exist in space. With scientists on the verge of discovering new planets, and even micro- bial life, they are still careful to distance themselves from the UFO phenomenon and the ridicule atten- dant upon it. Hynek's statement, \"Science is not al- ways what scientists do\" certainly hits the mark. To be a UFO researcher is to gain a healthy disrespect for the courage and vision of the scientific commu- nity... ....Studying the UFO phenomenon directly proved difficult. It was not courteous. It would not wait until it could be scientifically analyzed. Still, the reports themselves could be analyzed and gener- alizations drawn from them. We amassed hundreds of thousands of reports from around the world. We learned a tremendous amount about sightings. In fact, we eventually learned practically everything we could—given the limited information that comes from sighting reports. We studied UFO effects on the environment, the witnesses, the times of day or night of the sightings, the number of witnesses, the proximity of the witnesses to the objects, how long the objects were in view, their movements, the col- ors, their proximity to the ground, how they ap- peared and disappeared, radar traces, photographs, movies, tapes, occupants, and so on... ...But all this information did not come easily. We often found ourselves playing a cat-and-mouse game with the UFOs. When you wanted them to ap- pear they did not, and when you least expected it, they appeared. Their actions seemed purposeful and puzzling. For me, and for other investigators, the September 1997 Number 353 Page 11"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL UFOs' actions subtly imbued the objects with a life and personality of their own. This was in part be- cause the contactee controversy and the ridicule that the subject had endured prevented conservative and intellectually cautious researchers from fully engag- ing with the idea that the objects were probably pi- loted or controlled by aliens from another planet— although everyone fully understood that this might very well be the case... ...And there is evidence that the government has covered up. It was secretive about its Project Blue Book, Sign, and Grudge. It covered up its Project Mogul balloon project. It covered up the 1953 Robertson Panel. And when information about the Robertson panel was released in 1958, the Air Force covered up its CIA connections. It has released heavily censored documents. It has investigated more individual UFO events than had been previ- ously thought. This was important to learn because it pointed to the idea that the government could be hiding even more important facts and programs... ...Finally, I believe that we are in a new stage of UFO research. When the UFO mystery is solved we must begin the task of confronting it honestly and intelligently with a maximum amount of valid infor- mation. Coping with the phenomenon is going to be extremely difficult, if possible at all. As Bette Davis said in All About Eve, \"Fasten your seat belts. It' s going to be a bumpy ride.\" We have a lot to do and as the 21 st century approaches we must be ready with new ideas and new methodologies to meet the challenges that confront us. The truth is out there and we will attain it. Nobody said it was going to be easy, and the history of UFO research amply demonstrates this, but in the final analysis, we are right about the phenomenon and we have been right all along. We will prevail... CONNECTIONS: R LIFETIME OF SHflRED EXPERIENCES by Beth Ceilings & Rnna Jamerson flbstract Our talk will be presented in segments, each de- scribing our individual reactions and feelings about the abduction phenomenon as we delved deeper into our pasts. Connections: Solving our Alien Abduction Mystery, which we co-authored, will be the basis for our talk, since the book describes not only our shared experiences, but more importantly, how we dealt with those experiences and what we discovered about ourselves along the way... ... The talk will be accompanied by slides depict- ing recalled experiences, presumed alien beings we've both witnessed, and in some cases had inter- action with, and the interior and exterior of craft seen over many years... Beth Collings I would have felt a lot better about these revela- tions had I been able to view them in a more de- tached way. If these experiences, for instance, had been restricted to just Anna and myself, it would have been easier to cope. But I was forced into a stark realization when my granddaughter, who at the tender age of four, presented me with,a poster she had drawn depicting a thin man with an oversized head and large black eyes who she called \"Nu.\" This little man, she explained, came and took her to places she had never been before. They \"went fly- ing,\" she whispered to me. In the center of the poster, she had drawn a large triangular shaped ob- ject with lights swirling around it and faces peering out of windows along its edge. There was a small kite drawn in pencil over this shape... ... This, she explained, was not really part of the \"flying machine,\" but had been added to show that the machine flew as quiet as a kite... Rnna Jamerson What I recalled under hypnosis, though, was so realistic, so intense, that I knew in my heart it was something I was experiencing right then—not like remembering in detail, but actually reliving with all the attending sounds, smells, feelings, and emotions. What was even more astounding was that the things I saw and the events I experienced turned out to be so similar to those reported by Beth .in her earlier session that they could not have been either imag- ined or coincidental. This was really happening, and it had been happening all our lives. Now all we had to do was learn to deal with it!...

We are trying to deal with the experiences in an abstract and detached way so that we are not ruled by our emo- tions. But this has proven to be very difficult indeed. We found we were living two separate and distinct lives: One was'the public face we put on for those who were not associated with our dilemma; the other was the more relaxed and open face displayed in front of the aware. We found we couldn't con- tinue to live this way, though, and in December of 1993 we decided to blend the two and go public with our experiences... ... Several things might be accomplished by this action, we believed: Our own accumulated stress from hiding behind normalcy that no longer existed would be eased; those experiencing similar prob- lems and believing they were either crazy or making it up would realize they were not alone; and by talk- ing to others we might actually begin to purge the devils in our life that we felt had taken control away from us. We were, in fact, taking control back... ... The abductions continue for both of us on an irregular basis. We have attempted to \"catch them in the act\" by the use of various detectors, sensors, and video equipment, but thus far we have been unsuc- cessful. Friends and associates who have volun- teered to keep watch over us have sometimes expe- rienced strange happenings themselves, making it frustrating for us all, yet we haven't given up. Perhaps one day the aliens will provide us with something tangible as proof of their existence and interaction with the thousands of abductees out there. We all desperately need to know one way or the other; either these events are real or they are the result of some as yet unknown pathology. Too many people have described the same experiences for co- incidence to be considered plausible. So, this is ei- ther happening as reported or it is not, but it surely can't be both... Rnna Jamerson Whatever it turns out to be, we will have to deal with it—each in our way. Beth and I have found that humor, directed at ourselves as well as the aliens, re- lieves the tension. And lots of long talks with each other and ourselves have helped us to maintain some equilibrium. In short, we have learned to live again-on this plane... FIUE THEMES Further Findings of the Hbduction Transcription Project by Dan Wright, Project Manager Hbstract In this latest report on the Abduction Transcription Project, five themes forming the core reasoning for abduction events are presented. Despite obvious differences in physical appearance and abilities, separate entity groups interacting with persons across the continent are shown to have com- mon agendas. Prominently illustrated among over 140 passages from hypnotic and related sessions are the development of a \"hybrid\" species and a critical task which the subject must \"soon\" carry out. A strong interest in abduction episodes by our Government is revealed as well. The controlling theme in many cases is apparently an enigmatic connection between captive and captor... Introduction MUFON's primary effort to date to study inci- dents of human physical abduction by alien intelli- gences was initiated by the author in April 1992 at the Abduction Study Conference held at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Over the past five years, contributions have been received from nineteen researchers whose focus is on abduc- tion cases. This paper addresses the results of 906 tran- scripts, the great majority prepared from submitted audio cassettes of hypnosis sessions and attendant interviews, involving 254 separate cases... September 1997 Number 353 Page 13"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL Earlier reports by the Abduction Transcription Project (hereinafter the Project) outlined all con- ceivably important elements of abduction events, from the exterior and interior of the alien vehicle, through the physical characteristics and behavioral attributes of the captors,.to the effects, physiological and otherwise, on the human subjects.(\"abductees\" or \"experiencers,\" if preferred). In this update, con- centration is given to five key elements -— or themes — which go to the heart of abduction phe- nomena: • Entities' interest in human sexuality and repro- duction • Subject's \"alien connection\" born in a realm os- tensibly outside this conscious life • A \"mission\" subjects must perform at some un- specified point in the near future • Impending geophysical and other dramatic changes to the Earth, as shown to subjects • The U.S. Government's involvement and/or ac- quiescence in alien abductions As previously conveyed, regressive hypnosis can- not irrefutably uncover truth stemming from signifi- cant events in one's life. Whether such episodes ac- tually entail emotional or sexual abuse, a fanciful personality or some other prosaic explanation, the subjects in this Project nonetheless have concluded that unearthly beings are responsible for their recov- ered memories. Further, in that there are no conclu- sive means to discern fact from fiction in their recorded accounts, no greater weight is given to a particular case over any other. The passages selected here from hypnosis sessions and conscious inter- views are intended only to illustrate commonalities within the transcripts. Entity Primer It is the author's considered opinion that a signifi- cant number of entity groups have been intruding into the human consciousness over many years. A group may be defined to include from a few to sev- eral distinct entity types (or \"species\"). Each type has unique physical attributes, mental abilities rang- ing from quite limited to seemingly magical, and — at least in terms of the abduction sequence - an as- signed role and comparative rank within the group. The number of separate groups at work is difficult to estimate but may be upwards of a dozen. As a rule of thumb, short beings (i.e., well under 5 feet) with a greyish to off-white skin tone, either unclothed or wearing a tight-fitting one-piece uni- form, generally constitute what may be termed the group's \"away team\" (whimsically, the \"flight atten- dants\"). Their principal duties are to (a) invade the target subject's home (or, on fewer occasions, to stop the subject's auto or compel him/her to venture outside the house); (b) fell the subject, usually via an unseen force likened to physical paralysis; then (c) remove the person to a vehicle usually waiting some hundreds of feet aloft. Once aboard, the sub- ject is not likely to observe these original captors again until it is time to return home. Within the confines of the ship, the subject may encounter one or more \"doctors\" who are generally described as taller than the away team and with a different skin tone (from darker grey to tar or other color). They may wear a one-piece jumpsuit, lab- type coat or long robe, among other garment types. The attire is more likely to have adornments such as a collar, piping or an insignia. The doctor(s) takes the lead in performing basic (and sometimes radical) medical procedures and displays an air of authority. Technicians onboard may look much like the away team, similar to the doctors, or entirely differ- ent. Depending on the size of the ship, these may number only a few or dozens. They appear to have precise duties, some in support of the medical pro- cedures, either directly as attendants at the examin- ing table or indirectly at a nearby computer panel. Others are seen carrying out functions seemingly unrelated to the subject such as flying and maintain- ing the vehicle. But all appear clearly subservient to the \"doctor(s)\" or other entity in charge. Occasionally, the subject is approached by a \"fe- male\" entity, generally depicted as such by reason of its demeanor rather than by any obvious physical characteristic such as breast mass. This entity is evi- dently beckoned when the subject is especially dis- traught, offering sympathetic thoughts (conveyed telepathically), sometimes stroking the subject's hair or limbs to restore a tranquil state. So-called females likewise are seen in the ship's \"nursery\" of infants or fetuses in gestation. In 103 of the 254 recorded cases, the subject ex- pressed a familiarity with a specific being from pre- vious encounters, often with a certainty, even when several of identical appearance were together. In some cases the \"familiar\" being had been a regular feature of virtually every encounter. The one famil- iar to the subject was variously a \"flight attendant,\" a technician on the craft, a \"doctor\" or a \"female.\" This is not to suggest that such a being has in all cases been compassionate or even friendly toward September 1997 Number 353 Page 14"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL the subject, only that it was recognized over multi- ple events. Three decades of abduction literature have also borne out extremely tall beings (typically over 7 feet). With a pale but humanlike skin tone, high cheekbones and forehead, and robust physique, they have come to be known as the \"Nordics.\" In the Project's cases, such an individual has often been seen standing alone at a distance, simply observing the medical procedures. Many subjects have related an eerie familiar attraction to this entity. Not uncommon within the Project are \"reptilian\" beings — generally 5 to 6 feet in height, with a greyish-green or brownish-green scaly skin. They may be naked or wear either a jumpsuit or robe. While one's instinct is to immediately assign evil in- tent to these creatures, the files are a mixed bag of harsh, neutral/unemotional, and even friendly be- haviors. SIGHTINGS FROM RN HFRICHN CRSEROOK by Cynthia Hind D anie van Graan was a small-time farmer, wiry and fit, and living in a small village called Loxton, some 75 miles from Beaufort West in the desert-like Karoo of the Cape, South Africa. Not only was the village isolated, but the road leading to it ran through bleak countryside, with stunted gray bushes and an almost Mars-type landscape, where the tops of the hills had been shaved off by the wind to leave flat, table-top edges. On the cold, misty morning of July 31st, 1975, Danie rose early to check out his sheep in their en- closure or kraal. The reservoir serving Loxton was on the top of a hill behind the village, which spilled if the winter rains were heavy. To protect the vil- lage, an earthen wall 10 feet high had been built to divert the water. As Danie crested this earthen wall, he saw the aluminum roof of a trailer standing in his sheep enclosure. He knew there were some government prospec- tors around, looking for uranium, and a bit surprised that they had not asked his permission to locate there, he decided to go and have a cup of coffee with them. However, as he drew closer, he realized the windows were not the normal windows of a trailer, and that instead of standing on wheels, he could see three tines which supported the object. He also observed four men inside and noted that their movements appeared to be in slow motion. They were a bit on the smallish-side, he said, \"In fact, they were rather thin and pale. They were about 40 inches tall, wearing cream-colored overalls with hoods pushed back off their heads. They had fair hair, slanting eyes and high cheek-bones coming down to a pointed chin. Three of them appeared to be using an instrument and the fourth was standing near a panel with flashing triangular lights.\" There was a low, intermittent humming sound coming from the machine. When Danie reached within ten feet of it, he suddenly heard a \"click\" sound. He saw the men all look up at him and at the same time, a bright beam of light hit him in the eyes. He staggered and felt as though he was drown- ing. He felt ill and confused and fought to get out of the light. The beam went off suddenly and Danie re- alized that his nose was bleeding. The humming sound increased and the machine took off at an in- credible speed, just missing his windmill by cen- timeters, (inches). In 20 seconds the craft was gone, moving away at a 45-degree angle. Subsequently, Danie suffered from double vision and what he called \"lazy eye\"- difficulty in opening his eyes when waking in the morning. JUNE 24TH, 1947: HOW IT RLL BEGRN THE STORV OF THE RRNOLD SIGHTING by Bruce Maccabee J une 24, 1947. You will not find any conventional history book that even so much as mentions that on this date there began the public awareness of a phenomenon of such importance that it could well be the most significant phenomenon discovered in this century, or even in the history of humanity. The important event of this date was the sighting, by Kenneth Arnold, of a group of strange flying objects which eventually became known throughout the world as flying saucers. Unidentified Flying Objects or UFOs (English, German, Japanese, etc), OVNIs (Spanish, French) or NLOs (Russian). Since Kenneth Arnold's story was publicized around the world fifty years ago, sightings of UFOs/OVNIs/saucers have affected the lives of thousands of people the world over. So, why haven't history books mentioned this very important event? Because the subject of flying saucers has been con- sidered to be largely nonsense. Even though no one has yet offered a credible explanation for Arnold's sighting, it has been tacitly assumed by the majority of the academic community, the community most likely to write history books, that Arnold's sighting, and the tens of thousands of others since his, have been explained in many ways.

The witness spent over two hours with the humanoid pilots of a large craft who explained to him the purpose of their mission, personal details and the propulsion system enabling them to achieve faster-than light travel. I have spent more than three years of investigation, including visits to the U.S., locating and interview- ing the people involved, and in related research. Because of the quality of the information resulting, I believe that this case will become recognized as a landmark in Ufology. After presenting the facts of the case, analysis of the implications, I will draw conclusions - sup- ported in every instance by other cases - regarding the agenda of at least one alien group which has long visited our earth. In the process I discuss the duality within UFO phenomenon which researchers ignore at their peril, question what is really happen- ing in \"abductions\" and discuss new reasons for government cover-ups. MONITORING RIR FORCE INTELLIGENCE: SPRIN'S 1992-1997 UFO DECLRSSIFICHTION PROCESS by Uicente-Juan Ballester Olmos Hbstract The author played a key role in stimulating the Spanish Air Force to start in 1992 the release of UFO files, kept secret since 1962. This so called de- classification process, which just finished in the last weeks, has been monitored by the author thanks to a loose cooperation agreement Mr. Ballester Olmos established with the intelligence unit in charge. It has permitted him to watch over the process rather closely and to exert some influence to a certain ex- tent with the purpose to make the Air Force search for missing reports in various times. The discreet in- teractions with the author, MUFON representative in Spain and a long-time UFO researcher, ensures the integrity of the full disclosure of Defense UFO archives. Told for the first time, this paper shows the detailed history from the inside. As an added value, it also presents a statistical overview of the military cases.

There are indications that officials in other countries did indeed recognize that strange aerial objects required investigation much earlier than previously thought. After examining more.than 45% of the available 1947 newspapers in North America, many new observations are available for analysis. The new material shows that the official investigators drew conclusion and made decisions on the UFO problem with only a small amount of the available evidence. On December 18, 1947 it was reported that \"General Spaatz says Flying Discs' investigation is still in progress.\" General Carl A. Spaatz, Chief of Staff of the Air Force, said he was not convinced that such objects existed, but did not want to discard the possibility the saucers were the results of foreign experimentations. He asked for reports for the pub- lic. Early in the next year a government scientific board concluded that UFOs represented no scientific problem. Just a few months later at a meeting ofan- other scientific board, one of the Air Force's scien- tific advisors, an intelligence officer revealed that the Air Force had started an exhaustive investigation of the aerial mystery. Such contradictions would go on for almost the next fifty years. THE ROSWELL STORV, 1997 by Stanton T. Friedman Rbstract Mostly because of the movies and various televi- sion shows, much of the world has become aware of the notion that one or more flying saucers crashed not too far from Roswell, New Mexico, in the sum- mer of 1947. People are also more or less aware that the U.S. government supposedly collected the saucers and alien bodies and has covered up the wreckage and the bodies ever since with both intim- idation of civilian and military witnesses, and stonewalling of the General Accounting Offices's attempts to get more information. Unfortunately, much of the information put out in the media is ei- ther flat-out wrong or seriously misrepresents the facts. With the feeding-frenzy expanding at the ap- proach of the 50th Anniversary (July 2) of both the crashes near Corona, and in the plains of San Augustin, New Mexico, and of Kenneth Arnold's famous sighting of June 24, it appears useful to re- view recent developments.

Carpenter Rbstract This paper shall present information on present- day encounters occurring around the world as well as extensive documentation of unexplained encoun- ters from records kept over many centuries. Are the same kinds of extraordinary events occurring both now and then? Are biblical \"burning shields\" the same as present-day glowing discs? Are tales of magical fairies abducting children and adults the same as those of small-figured aliens floating people away? How can common folks on the remote island continent of Australia describe the same details about bizarre visits from reptilian beings, praying mantis creatures, and little gray humanoids with big black eyes? Whether it is here or there, now or then, strange encounters with unusual beings have been occurring worldwide, presently, and for centuries. i. Introduction Traveling around the world to Holland, England, Mexico, Brazil, Chile, and Australia in the past two years has allowed this author to compare notes on UFO encounters on a worldwide basis. Research into these bizarre topics has been quite se- rious for over the past 50 years in nearly all of these countries. Many good cases and quality investiga- tions have occurred. All report the same kinds of creatures, crafts, and procedures. For example, through Jenny Randies' report at the M.I.T. Abduction Study Conference in June, 1992, we were led to believe that the majority of alien contact cases in Great Britain were the Nordic or \"tall blonde\" type of entity. However, my recent visit to England and Scotland revealed that the statistics were in fact exactly like those found in the United September 1997 Number 353 Page 18 States. According to Britain's highly respected UFO abductions researcher and retired police officer, Anthony Dodd, reports of Grays comprise about 75- 80% of alleged encounters while Nordics, Reptilians, and Praying Mantis types round out the other 20-25%. Amazingly, on the other side of the world on the remote island continent of Australia, the same kinds of creatures and statistics are docu- mented. Emotional reactions and psychological responses are alike worldwide. Credible witnesses did not wish for these events nor need for them to intrude into their lives. Hearing accounts from Australians in great detail and emotional intensity was impres- sive. Describing small triangular burns, electrical disturbances in the home, enhanced psychic abili- ties, plus particular but little known aspects of Reptilians and Praying Mantis types are not things one would expect to hear twice anywhere else. Because of the worlwide correlations, it would be simply astounding if this whole phenomenon were not a reality. THE UFO PHENOMENON HND THE SUICIDE CULTS - HN IDEOLOGICHL STORV by Budd Hopkins Rbstract The media attention recently afforded the Heaven's Gate Suicide cult presented serious UFO researchers with a unique opportunity. We were able to demonstrate the contrast between our laboriously acquired knowledge of the UFO phenomenon and the suicide cult's uninformed, quasi-religious coop- tion of UFO imagery."},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL Unlike the followers of Marshall Applewhite, sci- entifically oriented researchers freely admit that the answers to most of the basic questions about the UFO phenomenon are still unknown. For example, we do not claim to know who the UFO occupants are, where they come from, or what ultimate plans they have for us. Put starkly, the bottom-line ques- tion—whether the UFO occupants will turn out to be friends or foes—is still very much open. On the other hand, through careful investigation of physical evidence and eyewitness testimony, UFO researchers have amassed a great deal of infor- mation about the aliens' patterns of behavior and the physical, psychological and emotional procedures they regularly inflict upon their human captives. Surprisingly, though members of \"UFO\" cults like Heaven's Gate usually have detailed answers to all of the open questions I've listed above, few of them claim to have had personal UFO experiences. As I've written elsewhere, the cults are all beliefs and no miracles, whereas the UFO phenomenon can be said to be all \"miracles\" and no beliefs. Centrally I address the theme common in various suicide cults and in the writings of some influential figures within the UFO community: \"Life here on earth is so flawed that only godlike UFO occupants can save us from ourselves. The planet is dying, governments cannot be trusted, religions cannot be believed, and most of mankind is morally bank- rupt.\" I demonstrate how such sweeping negative ideas have been promulgated by suicide cults, fac- tions within the UFO community, and right-wing, racist militias. Pessimistic politics makes strange bedfellows.

Introduction This paper continues the work of outlining the history of UFO cases, investigations and social atti- tudes in various countries, published in previous MUFON Proceedings. I will concentrate this time on the Far East, specifically the People's Republic of China, Japan and South Korea. Although I am not fluent in Oriental languages, I've had some first- hand experience in the Far East. I visited Japan three times between 1990 and 1995 for lectures and professional activities (I currently publish a monthly UFO column in the Japanese magazine Borderland and visited South Korea once in 1997. While I've not yet visited China, I have followed Chinese ufology from its beginnings in the late 1970s, publishing several articles about UFO cases in China. More recently, I had the opportunity of in- terviewing in Spanish one of the Presidents of the China UFO Research Organization (CURO). Professor Sun Shi Li, who briefed me on several cases with strong physical evidence reported in 1994... The 1947 flying saucer wave reached China as well...Unlike most other countries in the world, however, the flying saucer issue was quickly forgot- ten in China as the civil war between Nationalists and Communists engulfed the nation.

Thus, on November 13. 1978. the People's Daily, China's leading newspaper and the official organ of the Chinese Communist Party, finally gave a \"green light\" to the coverage of UFOs. Other newspapers, magazines and journals followed suit. By 1980, a group of students from Wuhan University in Hebei province, headed by Cha Leping, formed the China UFO Research Organization (CURO), obtaining some degree of support from the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. A newsstand magazine. The Journal of UFO Research, was launched in February 1981 with 300.000 copies... THE GOD HYPOTHESIS by Joe Lewels For those who have experienced first hand what it is like to be in the presence of the beings, the trans- formation is shocking, mind shattering and some- times life shattering. For others, who gain this knowl- edge through research, like myself, the transforma- tion may be gradual, sometimes taking half a lifetime. But whichever way it happens, once the knowledge is received, the person is transformed. No longer can he accept the consensus view of the scientific commu- nity regarding what it considers the \"impossibility\" of travelling among the stars. No longer can he accept the church's teachings regarding the nature of God and of the universe. Such a person is caught in no- man's land - that place between science and religion where all the rules have been changed and for which there is no guidebook. For the researcher, the enigmas of the Unidentified Flying Object and of \"alien\" visitations are extremely complicated and all-encompassing. The researcher September 1997 Number 353 Page 20 quickly learns that one cannot delve too deeply into these mysteries without getting entangled in an intri- cate web of related, paranormal phenomena including out-of-body experiences, angelic or demonic-like ap- paritions, psychic abilities, past-life memories, and precognitive visions. He also finds that it is impossi- ble to try to understand these phenomena without be- coming deeply involved in such diverse fields as the study of the origins of the human race, ancient civi- lizations, ancient and current religions, the latest find- ings in quantum physics, neurophysiology, and psy- chiatry, to name but a few... LETTER TO THE EDITOR Reference to my un-answered letter of July 14 which I am following up with by enclosing an article that appeared in The Chronicle of Higher Education on July 25, which was another skeptical viewpoint of the celebrated and controversial Roswell, N.M. UFO crash back in July, 1947. This article highlighted a new book, scheduled to be released this month, entitled U.F.O. Crash at Roswell: The Genesis of a Modem Myth. The pub- lisher is the esteemed Smithsonian Institution Press. The authors are unknowns, namely two anthropology professors and a retired atmospheric professor, who have joined the ranks of fellow debunkers, such as your own Kent Jeffrey, author of \"Roswell — Anatomy of a Myth,\" and Karl Pflock, reviewer of The Day After Roswell by retired Lt. Col. Philip J. Corso, both of which appeared in the June issue of the MUFON UFO Journal. Thought you would be interested in this, inasmuch as you seem to lean over backwards to discredit the crash of an alien space craft in the New Mexico desert fifty years ago. This article is just more ammunition that you can use in your attempt to put down the claims of eyewitnesses and UFO researchers who at- test to the governmental cover-up of the most cele- brated crash retrieval case in our history. You should inform yourself about the elusive UFO enigma and especially about our government's in- volvement with suppressing the facts in the case by. listening to the Art Bell Coast-to-Coast radio talk show aired over the Chancellor Broadcasting Network from Nevada.. The daily program is broadcast through- out the United States and is an undisputed source of accurate and objective news reporting. You would then hear about the true facts involved in the masive UFO cover-up by our federal bureaucracy. If you ever gather up enough courage to respond to my comments, then I'd be glad to hear from you. —Fred R.

Webb uiiuiHfip* o October 1997 Bright Planets (Evening Sky): Venus (magnitude -4.3) continues low in the SW at twi- light, setting about 8 PM daylight time. The brilliant object is higher from the southern states. During the month Venus changes position with respect to the nearby planet Mars and the star Antares. From October 4 to 6, a crescent Moon passes by the trio; Mars and Antares are just to the S of Venus. The latter lies 1.7° above Antares on the 16th, is between Mars and Antares on the 18th and 19th, and closes to within 2° below the red planet on the 26th. Mars (1-1), moving from Scorpius into Ophiuchus, remains low and hard to see in the SW at dusk. It sets in the WSW shortly after 8 PM in mid-October. Our little planetary neigh- bor is 3° above its red rival star Antares on the 1 1th and 2° above Venus on the 26th. (See Venus above.) Jupiter (-2.5), in Capricornus, stands in the SSE at dusk and advances westward during the evening. The giant world re- sumes its normal motion against the stars on October 8 (east- ward). This is its actual counterclockwise revolution around the Sun shared by all the planets. The Moon lies near Jupiter on the 10th and 1 1th. Saturn, in Pisces, reaches a point in the sky opposite the Sun on October 10. The 0.2-magnitude ob- ject then rises in the E near sunset, remaining in view all night in the southern sky. The full moon is near it on the 15th. Bright Planets (Morning Sky): Jupiter sets in the W about 1 AM in mid-October. Saturn sets in the W near sunrise. Mission to Saturn: The barrage of planetary missions continues this month as the Titan-Centaur rocket launches the U.S. -European Cassini probe to Saturn. In order to reach the ringed planet in 2004, the spacecraft will employ two gravity assists from Venus, one from Earth, and another boost from Jupiter. Cassini's goal is to study Saturn's thick atmosphere, rings, and satellites and to eject a second probe into the atmosphere of the moon Titan.

The horse's body, the Great Square, can be seen high in the SE. And attached to the NE corner of the square is the constella- tion Andromeda the Princess, composed of a double row of stars curving outward from the star Alpheratz in the square. The Big Dipper skims along the northern horizon at this sea- son. Late autumn is the asterism's poorest evening showing of the year. On the night of October 18-19 the gibbous Moon occults (or covers) the Ist-magnitude orange star of Taurus, Aldebaran. In 'Hawaii the occultation begins around moonrise in mid evening. On the West Coast the event occurs after 12:30 AM, and on the East Coast after 5 AM. The star is hidden for periods ranging up to more than an hour depending upon one's location.

After a big 50th an- niversary celebration in Roswell in 1997, \"Roswell Days\" is now scheduled for July 3, 4 and 5, 1998. MUFON has scheduled our 1998 International UFO Symposium for June 26, 27 and 28, 1998, at the beau- tiful Renaissance Denver Hotel in Denver, Colorado, one week before the Roswell affair, so our members may attend both events if they so desire. I have ad- vised the sponsors for Leo Sprinkle's meeting at the University of Wyoming in Laramie about the above dates so they will be able to schedule the Rocky Mountain UFO Conference on a different weekend, if possible. JOURNAL MEMBERSHIP SURVEY At the State Director's annual meeting in Grand Rapids, Michigan, on July II, 1997, the participants voiced their opinions about the contents of the MU- FON UFO Journal. Since the Journal is a member- ship publication and not a newsstand magazine, it is essential that we know what our readers expect from their magazine in order to improve upon its format and articles. With all of the competitive publications, electronic news media, and computer nets competing with the Journal, we have noted a significant decline over the past two years in membership/subscriptions. As the voice of the world's largest UFO organization, it is imperative that our magazine not only reflect the current trends in ufology but contain the material that is of primary interest to our members. When one considers the vast range of intellect, edu- cation, experience, and age of the MUFON members reading the Journal, a survey to determine their pri- mary interests is going to be vastly diversified. Too many people feel that the Journal is written specifi- cally for them and their preconceived ideas or beliefs, without regard to the thousands of other readers. We must remember that the primary goal of MUFON is to attempt to resolve the UFO enigma utilizing the scien- tific method, not simply wishful thinking. This means keeping an open mind to new ideas and theories that could conceivably lead to solving the most important scientific mystery of the space age. We cannot permit September 1997 Number 353 Page 24 ourselves to accept one writer's interpretation and re- ject the others. The only thing that we can say about Roswell, with certainty, is that a monumental event occurred that our government is trying to cover up with downright stupid explanations. Is this their calcu- lated approach to revealing that they have been lying about UFOs for fifty years? When you are completing your survey form, we want your personal evaluation, however, keep in mind that many other people will be expressing their opin- ions also, so do not be disappointed if all of your per- sonal suggestions are not implemented. In order for the MUFON UFO Journal to take some major steps forward, as our major communication vehicle with our readers, we are hoping to achieve \"the best of all worlds.\" A membership survey is being conducted at this time to evaluate the contents of your Journal and thus take evolutionary steps to meet the wishes and desires of our readers for improvements. With the inaugura- tion of SKYLOOK in 1967, our monthly publication has been able to stay abreast of advancements and cur- rent trends in ufology, however, in order to maintain our worldly position, dramatic steps must be taken im- mediately. For this reason, we are seriously seeking the guidance of our readers, because you are the peo- ple who represent MUFON to the world A survey form is enclosed with this issue of the Journal. Please complete the survey form and return it promptly to MUFON headquarters in Seguin, TX. Please attach any and all suggestions in a narrative format to your survey form, because we could not have covered every item of importance on one page. It is not necessary to sign the survey, but we hope that you will, so we can inquire further about your sugges- tions for improvement. We heed your help. Thank you for your gracious assistance.
