Jayo was on his way home to Bay City from Caro, whcre he plays in a band week-ends. The sky was cloudy and it had just stopped raining when Jayo wheeled his car onto N 15. Then it happened. Two brightly lighted round discs flsshed up ahead - of his c:-r and whisked overhead, traveling southwzrd. The radio buzzed with stetic. Jayo stepped on the accelerator. \"It lasted for only four to six says Jay,o, \"but it seemed like a day. When I saw the first one it appezrcd to be zbout 25 feet in dianeter and zbout 50 fcet up.\" His radio made a sound similzr to the ore m2de when a car travels nezr or under high tension wires, Jayo reported. The first ob2ect lef2 the Bay City industrial worker bewildered. The second convinced him, he says, that it was something more than just lights. So he hezded for the Bay County Sheriff's Department and filed a report. A de~uty at the sheriff's clewrtment took him seriously, he reported, and told him that he had worked in the Air Force's UFO team when in the service. He then called the radar inst?lletion at Fort Austin and kiss told thev could neithcr deny or confirm the sighting. Later an official from the 754th Rad~r Squzdron ~t Port Austin said equin~ent had not picked up 2nything unusual, but added th~t they would not hzve picked up objects flying low because of ground clutter 2nd the long distance to M 15. Jay0 szid the two objects he saw were trzvcling between 100 ~nd 150 miles an hour and w~re intensely bright with light em?n?ting from the center tow?rd the discs1 edges, where there was a greenish-blue haze. He heard no sound from them, His phone kept ringing all day Saturd: y after the incident wzs re~ortcd Fy the news media and he w~s interviewed by a radio and tele- vision stotion, according to the story in Sunday, Oct. 11, 19Saginaw News. l7 C. C. Williams, Jr., of Rochester, Kichigan, and Fred 8. Vsrner, a Mzdison Helghts, Michigan, resident, made the trip to Bay City, Sunday morning to interview Ja~o. They stopped first at the sheriff's office where Deputy Prybylski reviewed the Jayo report idith them, then wcnt on to theJay0 home at l9Ol ColumSus Avenue. Jayo, appzrently still ncrvous from his encounter, was willing to talk ?bout his experience. The flrst object, he said \"damn near hit the c2rT9 and the second was a lot higher and they both \"scared the hell out of rr!e.ls Asked if he looked back to see whcre they went, he said he looked in the rnlrrnr but didn't see anything. 111 just had no curiousity to stop, and I just put my foot in the czrburetor and got the hcll out of there. liho'd want to wait around?ll Jayo gzvc 2s his ouinion llth~yl' were using the ro2d 3s a guide and didn't sce him, but he h~d his lights on ~nd thought thty should have, The ob2ects were th~ spne shepe 2nd moving af the same r?tc of speed, Jzp~ said, 2nd only the unc!ersides were illmineted.

Both he and his wife like the black sea bass which c2n be caught at Cholla Bay. This l~st week he was down there but he didn't catch any fish. HOW- ever he has a stcry to tell, and according to Formiller, it is not a fish story. Following an sPternoon of surf fishing l~st Thursday he wslked back down to the beach just to look around. At about 9 o'clock he noticed a light in the sky which sccmed to be coming towerds him. He said thzt it wzs one of the unidentified flying objects that every one has heard about. It was round and saucershaped. It was also quiet-. There was no wind blowing and the sea w~s quiet with no surf noise. The UFO appeardd to stop and hover about 200 to 300 feet above the water. Then it turned on a searchlight from the bottom of the vehicle and illuminated a spot on the wzter which Formillcr said sppeared to be about $ mile across. The light extended almcst to the shore. Formille:~ was st2nding about five feet from the weter7s edge. The searchlight was locsted within a tube and as the light was raised or lowered the illumin~tion was changed from a sharp spot to a wide floc light on the surface of the water. At first he thought that it was a helicopter searching f,or something, but there was no sound. After a few minutes a cloud WES formed arouzl the vehicle which did not appepr to be caused by cxhsust gases beczuse there was no blowing of the cloud. After about five minutes of this p~rticul~r behavior, the search- light w2s turned on from the top of the vehicle illumin~ting the upper part of the cloud. The vehicle then started moving in a westerly direction 2nd wes vis- ible for about 20 minutes. Other lights were visible on the ship which gave the cloud a green cast, Friday morning Formill~r ssked some other fisherman if they had sccc the strznge light in the sky the night befhre.0ne msn, who is a securit-,, guzrd at one of the industrial plznts in the Phoenix zrea, said that he was just coning into the b2y after h~ving been out in the gulf all afternoon, and he saw the light in the air. He also szid that he s2w it move to the west with the greenish cloud around it. However, hc wac in another part of the bay and could not see the searchlight shining on the water. 11 Formiller, who lives at 3132 N. 40th St. said that he would swear on a stack of Bibles, against any government official who s~ys th~t therb, are no UFO1s that he saw what he saw.\" Bill Finch, ESP Columnist, is investigating the Cholla Bay incident, Credit: blilliam (Bill) J.

She doesn't insist that there is, but some happen- ings seem a little more than coincidence to her and she would like to know if anyone else has noticed a correlation. In April 1967 Mrs. For~seca and her husband and daughter saw a UFO and it was followed by a rain derailment about 20 miles from Rich~ond! Indiana. Last winter (1969) there was a UFO report on the Dayton, Ou, radio and another train wreck. At about the same time, there was a plane crash, never satisfactorily explained. Mrs. Fonseca saw a UFO Oct. 4th, and therewas a train wreck near Richmond on the 7th. Mrs. Fonseca and her daughter had returned home from church about 9PM, April Znd, and Mrs. Fonseca was checking some papers (she taught the seventh grade at thet time) and her husband was watching TV when h? remarked he puessed it was going to rain. Mrs. Fonseca had noticed the sky was perfectly clear as she was coming home and when her husband szid he had just seen lirhtning, she went to the window to peer out. Just as she reached the window, there was a blinding flash of light. \"the kind vou get when vou use a flash ,bulb to take a night picture.\"- she wrote, and she fell back, almost into the arms of her husband and dauehter who were also sp~roaching the window and had b eeri startled 5: the light. Mrs. Fonseca said naybe it was just because she was scare<, but when the light hit her, her face burned just as it would when vo:~ open the coor to a coal-burning heating stove and the hot air rushez ill; to your face. The burning sensation soon disappeared, but her face bdas unnaturally red for several days. As Mrs. Fonseca describes it,, there was a mad rush for the door as all had the same impulse to hurry outside to seek the source of the light. Mrs,. Eonseca was first to make it, then returned for a coat as the night air was cold, and Mr. Fonseca then spotted the ligh'; from the open doorway and they watched it It hung in the sky about about 556 and seemed to be abou% the si~e - C of a base,ball. The light was exceedingly bright and she com~xr-.d -LC b, the yard lights now seen on many fzrms. The object moved to %~12 ncr t'i and was in view for nearly a half hour. A few days later the Fonsecas were driying on State 3oute 320 2--*; keeping an eye on the sky as they were still talking of what they i ,., seen,earlier. As they turn& cl\"f the road to gc to their hoze, t?~; ,*?os- \"this round thing hanging in tte sky.\" The colors were orange and b::o,n and gray and \"all mixed up togeiher and dirty looking.\" It was in view about 3 minutes, then disappeared. The Fonsecas are used to seeing airplanes and helicopters and feel sure that is not whay they had seen. Mrs. Fonseca saw znother unidentified object about 12:30 the mornin.:; of Sunday. October kth, this year. Their dogs st:rted barking and hcw! - ing and she stepped outside to see if she could learn what had distu:,;.' them. At first she saw nothing, then was aware of a flash of light from the sky. She saw nothing unusual so went back in the hoxe for her binoculars. She searched the sky for 15-20 minutes before she spotted a moving object and all the while the dogs were barking and howling a~.l \"having fi.tsJff as she put it, and the cows bepan to moo. There were sili:-f of alarm from the horses 2nd Mrs. Fonseca heard an owl hoot and some birds ca 11 from the woods, (Continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"... ... ,. . ...... .......

Kewn must. have been scarce in Prescott that day. It seems the !;opi Indizn believes the human race will pass through three states of life with periods of punishment and purification and they now await the next Purification Day \"at which time 211 wicked or wrong doers shall be pnished or destroyed after which real peacej brotherhood and everlasting life shall be brought about.\" (This differf little from some other religions and we respect every \"true believer\" of any faith.) The point welre getting to is that Paul Solem claims he is in contact with the prophets from Venus who keep him posted on the latest in the Hopi prophecy developments, and they use flying mu- cers to approach this nlmet, then communiczte with Solem by telepathy, This w~s the case, i~ is claimed, the night of August 18, when Mr. Kraus and several nei~hbors, along with Solem, stood in a b2ckyard in Prescott and watched a strenge object in the sky. \"It loo1;ed like a star--almost,v Kraus wrote. \"It rose in the sky, stopped, hovered, w2:- ered to one side and then continued across the sky reperting the m2n- euvers. l7 ltIt was a long wzys awzy, but we thought it changed color from a white to a reddish orange end then to a purplish blue and then to a reddish white.

As far as Mr. Kraus and his companions wue concerned, th~t w?s it --but Paul Solem, who stood just a few feet away watching the objeci,, said it \"communicated.\" We won't go into the messages of gloom anpi doom he said he received from the occupant of the distant flyi~g ob;ect . . . you've heard them all before, in one form or another, as p~ssed on to us by contactees who keep in close touch with the Spzce 3i-others, Mr. Kraus goes on to tell us Paul Solem contacted his firs'; ,sauce)- occupant in 1948 and has since become an expert in Moriwn docczlr-a ~\"ft the Hopi prophecy. In a prevlous life, he lived on Venus, he clairnz and he is just one of the many here on Eerth with a similar- backgroiu-ct with the \"call\" to work in fulfilling prophecy. He goes wh~re hc is \"directed\" to teach and preach. The people from Venus, he says, lo3k just like humens, with hair c;t neetly to thcl~ shoulders, and it's difficult to tell mle from fzzale (that's nothing new--we have the same difficulty with some of th?

The family had just finished shooting fireworks when they observed \"this round-shaped object just floating over the tree tops abut 150 f~et up in the aireft It was moving fi-om east to west 2nd Mr. Treme concluded it had to be a solid object as it blotted out the stars as it moved across the sky. As it moved overhead, he sw dark spots on the bottom of the object and szid they reminded him of portholds. The object was dark brown in color with very little illumin~tion, and therc was no sound. He judged it to be from 80 to 100 feet in diamater and szid it \"just drifted by in about ten seconds.lt Mrs. Beverly Jeagers, of 7210 Dsle Ave., Richmond Heights, reported that she heard a radio report of a UFO in the area at th~t time, and she went outdoors to look zt the sky and saw an odd light in the west.

Mr. Herbstritt, hi. r-4 -, is an Electrical Technician at the Pure Carbon Co. in St. blar-p. EJ-J interest in astronomy, beginning in high school, soon led tc zn int-2real in UFOs. Mr. Herbstritt has four fine telescopes which he bus; himscl. He followed the Apollo moon shots closely and hzs a vast coll- -tion cf photos, slides etc in addition to his growing collection of 5aoks an.! articles on ufology. Now to M:>rkls article: Each month I will pive the constellztion that is ne?r the meridim (north-south imeginery line) pt sbout 9 o'clock for that particular month. No intricate astrononical terms will be used, as this is foi- the layman who likes to study the heavens. AS the earth performs its yesrlv revolution around the sun, we notice th2t the constellations s.;m to move in a clockwise direction. Aries (the Ram) wss nzmed by the Greeks, who pictured it ss the ram with the golden fleece which was the goal, ,of the Argonauts1 quest. Arie. is not a conspicuous constelletion, but it is probebly the most femois of the 12 in the zodiac. Thousends of yeprs ego the sun stood before the stars of this constell~tion when it crossed the 1 quat tor on the first days of spring. This is csllcd the first point of Pries on the vernal Equinox. Aries is almost directly south from Cassiopeia, the $. Since most of the stsrs in Aries are faint and just discernible to ths naked eye, a clear dark sky is needed to observe them. A tri~rgle form- ed by its three brightest stars identify this dim constell~tion.

QUINCY DAILY HERALD, April 12, 1897 PASSES IN THE NIGHT The Mysterious Airship Made Partly Down in Hannibal Everybody is talking of a mysterious airship that is preambulating the heavens with red and green sidelights and an electric searchl-ignt on bow. AS it has no particular opposition in aerisl navigation the use of the sidelights must be more ornamental than otherwise. The talk of the mysterious craft recalls to the mind of Edward Ryan, driver of the police patrol waron, a stt-tement m~de to him by his brother-in-law, E. P. Smith, of Hannibal, several months ago. Smith has a machine shop and in course of conversation during a visit in Quincy said thpt he hed a job in making a cylinder for an engine on order of a str~nger. The strangcr was not communicative, but volunteered the information that the cylinder was for an sirship on which he was at work. It may be, therefore, that the ship that passes in the night and scares timorous people was made partly in Hannibal. If such is the case, we'll have to take more notice of it. The fact gives it a local interest. QUINCY DAILY HERALD, April 12, 1897 THE BLAZING AIR SHIP Hovers for Fifteen Minutes Over the Milwaukee Court House Seen by Thousands of People-The Wheels Seen Working--It is a Machine and Not Star-the Maker of the Mysterious Concern Revekls - Himself. ---------------- Milwaukee, Wisc., April 12.--Prof. Hough an+ his theory thI2t the supposed airship is the star \"Alpha Orinois\" c!onlt stand 2s liS.:;~ in the minds of thousands of citizens of this city as last night. \"I:-; heve seen the wonder and are convinced th~t it is a machine whSr', navigates the air, and not a star which has been w2nd~ring arouri? :+-? 10,000,000 or more years throuph space without an object or a destin- ation. The strpnge machine made its first appearance in the wee small hours yesterday morning. It was not seen by many at th~t tine, but the few who did see it ere convinced th2t it is a machine. The lights which appeared on it seemed to move backwards and forwards tow~rd each other, as if signaling to the earth. It was first seen on the northern horizon, and bout the only per- sons who were up at the time and who were not seeing things ~ouble were a few newspaper men, police officers, and a guard 2t the house of correction. All of these are willing to make oath they saw an sirship come from the north a little before the break of daylight and that it disappeared again, reversing itself and fading from view in the north, Last night the strmger made its appearance again in the heavens about 9 o'clock. It came from the northcast from out ovsr the lake. There was no possibility of a mistake this time. Thousands of people saw it, and in a few minutes they were following the mzchine as it (continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"..:. 9. . .

The heavens were all ablaze with glory; co~r,fless stars shone brilliantly. A fleecy white cloud slowly obscured the moon. Then a flash, as if of lightfling, was not?:- ed. Just above Jersey a long bright streak of light was seen extend-. ing in a horizontal direction directly east and west. It was very bri' liant for the space of five minutes. Then the larger end of the illum- inating staff--for thzt is what it appeared like--the one tomrd the west, burst into millions of little stars which flew in every direction n- 1 and made the country round about as bright as in day. lne stars were stationary for some minutes and then they slowly fade^ from view as they fell toward the earth. The scenery was beautiful in itself, and this addition was grand. Large pieces of the airolite are said 30 hme been found shortly after its appearance. (Credit: Loren E.
