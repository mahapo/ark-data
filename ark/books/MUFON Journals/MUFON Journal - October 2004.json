Schuessler WUFOD Shutdown It is with great regret that we must announce the shutdown of the World- wide UFO Database (WUFOD) found on the MUFON web site at www.mufon.com. DonWeatherby and Wendy Ban were the creators of WUFOD. They spent a great amount of their own time and money to make it a reality. However, they have reached a point where they cannot keep up with WUFOD and must let it go. It was a fine system, allowing report- ing of UFOs by the public and follow-up by field investigators, state section direc- tors, and state directors. Each week it provided a statistical analysis of the da- tabase content, providing useful informa- tion in a dozen different ways. I personally was a great fan of this excellent tool, and took every opportu- nity to expose the public and media rep- Jolin Schuessler resentatives to its usefulness. From the feedback I am getting, I am not alone in missing WUFOD and working with Don and Wendy. The MUFON Business Board is working on a plan for replacing WUFOD and continuing the job of ob- taining UFO reports, documenting them in a new database, and picking up where WUFOD left off. This will not be an easy task, so I ask you all to bear with us until we can bring the new system on line. WUFOD didn't happen over night, so I don't expect the new system will appear as if by magic either. As an interim measure, we have posted a simple reporting form on the MUFON web site. The public may re- port UFO sightings to MUFON by us- ing that form, and headquarters will pass the incoming reports to the appropriate state director for action. Entry into the database will be deferred until the new system is available.

He said he has seen larger and more elaborate designs in wheat and soybeans, but has heard of only one formation in corn that was larger. \"It is impressive not just because of its size,\" explained Wilson, who has been examining crop circles since 1996, \"but because of the exactness of the geom- etry and the way the stalks are bent. I've seen lots of hoaxes, but this one doesn't have the characteristics of an obvious hoax.\" The formation was first spotted and reported by Maj. John DiPietro of the Miami Township Police Department. He was riding in a WHIO TV news heli- copter looking for sites for DUI check- points when he saw the formation and snapped a photo. The photo appeared on the cover of the Miamisburg- West Carrolton News, then began spreading via the Internet. The formation was reported to ICCRA on Sept. 1, and two members of the group, Ted Robertson and Doug McElwain, went to investigate, but were unsuccessful in locating the formation from the ground. However, they were able to easily spot it from the air. On Sept. 2, Wilson also took to the air to observe and photograph the formation prior to an on-ground in- vestigation. The crop circle is in a field owned by the Miamisburg School District, is not far from residences, and is near the Miami Township fire station and service garage. (The firemen, by the way, mounted a light high above the ground and shined it to- ward the circle to aid Wilson and the oth- ers as darkness neared.) The formation, estimated to be about a week old when investigated, is located in corn which is reportedly about eight feet high. It is not visible from outside the field, except from the air. The overall formation is 222 feet long, OCTOBER 2004 Although located near residential areas, a school, and afire station, the formation can be seen only from the air.

Wilson says he is most impressed by the way in which the ckcle was made. \"The stalks actually curve around inside the circle,\" he explains: \"They are not just laid in a circle, the stalks themselves are curved. The stalks were lying flat on the ground, but they were not bro- ken, although some are pulled out at the roots.\" Wilson says that no exploded nodes have been found. The stalks in the small- est circles are curved to make the cen- MUFON UFO JOURNAL"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"tral swirl of the lay. Each circle has a single standing stalk left in the center. He says the stalks are not scuffed, and that there is no evidence of any me- chanical flattening. A preliminary check with a Gamma Scout geiger counter set to detect gamma picked up a reading of. 18 to .24 micro-Sieverts per hour of radioactivity, \"which probably is above the background level, which is normally .09 to. 11,\" says Wilson. He adds, \"That could be significant. We will need to double check this and compare it to the actual background reading.\" He said he could not specu- late as to what the source of the radia- tion might be. Another anomaly sometimes associ- ated with crop circles, unexplained balls of light, may have been present at this formation. These were not actually observed by the investigators, but did appear to be present in one of the photos taken by Robertson at the formation. The largest of the \"blobs\" is in the upper left, and Robertson notes that it has \"sort of a trail,\" which would per- haps suggest that it was not an anomaly of the digital camera. Robertson and Wilson also reported hearing a \"beeping\" sound while in the circle, which was recorded. Miamisburg is known for its historic Adena Indian mound, a structure 65 feet high and 300 feet across. It is the larg- est conical earthwork in Ohio. Wilson says his group has recently received another report of a possible for- mation in corn, this one in Scioto County, OH, which the team will be investigat- ing. •r £ r i '\"I f\" '* 1^ f>i«^afi^J' -^—-* ft^^^a^^ fc^ \"j ^St^i JP^W^^J«*^ < ^f'ft jWjS ! -. ™^— - -£—•»-• &^«~-«».- JJB^ayFW**-^*'^ — f «*** W( ^**.^ r i ™»%^^T 3~^*A3o» \"*\" ^ ,. *TA-™c-**\" . u«»jCiWWdhfci.c.i,4-i- t ».L,4-k-I .LL.M4'-4--j4~»- 4'P-^I- aV^« il^*'-^^ V-^v- M®4M4^^ti<^^M- .j^t*»|3»j3au**.u..™B.. |*S^rK^5I*Lrn i -.LJ.«£I<.!«•«•&.* J l»9K5f !

Verifying what Marisa's mother had told me would be the challenge. Marisa died a few years after gradu- ating from college. I obtained her col- lege transcripts, but there was no men- tion of Raechel. Classmates remem- bered Marisa's \"otherworldly\" roommate, de- scribing her just as Gallic had done. There was a military base in the same town as the college. It had since closed, but a search of base publications, state archives, phone directories, newspapers, and tax records of that time period revealed nothing about the colonel. A name search conducted by a \"No Find, No Fee\" out- fit was futile. Marisa's mother, Gallic, tended to avoid any in-depth inquiries concerning the time when she looked into Raechel's eyes. Other seemingly unrelated, unexplain- able events concerning eyes alerted me to the fact that perhaps \"eyes\" were what UFO researchers call a \"trigger\" event. Something else happened at this point and the person doesn't want to deal with it. I got the name of a highly respected and licensed hypnotherapist, June Steiner, who agreed to regress Gallic to see what might be learned. The sessions were definitely not like the sanitized versions shown on television. A partial transcript of one session re- veals details of Raechel's appearance: Gallic: I am seeing Raechel. I can't see her face very well...because...she has big glasses...all over her face...no, not all over her face, but her face is so OCTOBER 2004 small there's not much left below it...below the glasses...and, and she has...she has something on her head, a scarf... and then the scarf comes down, and it's tied underneath her chin. So I don't get a good look at her face...and she looks funny, she looks....she looks too thin, or too skinny, or...she doesn't look right. But she's in a hurry, and I can't...! don't want to stare at her, but I really can't help it because she looks so funny. June: How do you feel as you stare at her? C: I feel awfully nervous...well, not nervous, I feel uneasy. I don't think I've seen anything like this before...she's not just a funny-looking person...she doesn't seem like a person. J: What does she seem like? C: I don't know...her arms are too long, but I can't see them. She has long...she has a long...long sleeves on, but her arms hang down too far...or something...something isn't right ...something's not right here (sobbing). But anyway I can't stare at her, that's not polite. But Marisa can't see me star- ing at her, so that's all right...but.... J: Just let yourself remember all the little details of what you did see. What do you remember her hands looking like? C: They were too long. Her fingers were not right...they were fingers ...but...they were supposed to look like fingers, but...they looked artificial somehow...but I can't keep staring be- cause she wants to go by...and...and Marisa is trying to introduce us and... I'm just staring...I'm not acting right...because I've never seen anything like this before...and I don't know what Raechel thinks...but I don't care really what she thinks.

Keep in mind that this case surfaced well before our current knowledge of gene swapping, as well as before much was being repoYted about hybrids. As mentioned last month, readers should also note that while this case suggests collusion between the military and the aliens, screen memories cannot be ruled out. A much more complete account of this case will be presented in an upcom- ing two-part book. See ad on page 23. I'm overreacting or something, and I don't know what's the matter with me.

C: (sobs) I just feel she's...she's not right. J: You just trust that feeling and let yourself be all right with that feeling; that's your deeper self responding to something that you know and feel. What happens next? C: Well...we get through the introduc- tions ...and she says.... I—am—so— happy—to—meet—you...I have^ heard—so—much—about—you...and I think, she doesn't even sound right.

The hypnotic regressions revealed names long forgotten in Callie's con- scious memory. Exploring more \"trigger\" events became mirrors reflecting one thing, yet hiding another. Paranormal, unexplained, and unexpected events, OCTOBER 2004 •M. The \"fish bowls \" containing babies and green liquid. frightening at first, became the norm. Slowly the gaps in Callie's story filled. After five years we seemed to be at a standstill. We had amassed a very compelling case in support of the Hybridization Project, yet we still wanted something other than anec- dotal proof of Raechel's existence. We stopped the active research.. The next day a letter was received on official college stationery confirm- ing that Raechel had attended college and was granted a sudden leave of absence in the spring of 1971. Unex- plained things, seemingly relevant to the case, continue to happen to both of us. This is just a minute portion of the research conducted; the summary of the entire case runs approximately 250 pages. We looked into Raechel's eyes and continue to do so. The investigation continues; we are not out of that room of mirrors quite yet. Kentucky professor says extraterrestrials are here In the world of academia, Northern Kentucky University philosophy profes- sor Dr. Robert Trundle realizes his be- liefs are not exactly widely embraced. \"Shunned\" is the word he sometimes uses. The title of his forthcoming book is, in part at least, in response to what he calls \"the cowardice and vanity of a sizeable percentage of American professors.\" Scheduled for release early next year, it's called Is ET Here? No Politically, but Yes Scientifically and Theologi- cally (EcceNova Editions, Victoria, Brit- ish Columbia). So what does he mean by that title? Do beings from places other than this planet walk among us? \"Yes, I believe contact was made 50 years ago-and I believe beings from other planets are here now, mainly to study us,\" Dr. Trundle said. \"Does ET exist from a political per- spective? No, because the government is afraid of the culture shock and public MUFON UFO JOURNAL panic. For the government to acknowl- edge the existence of extraterrestrials here would be to admit it can't protect us from them. \"Scientifically, I argue that thousands of well-regarded witness accounts can- not simply be dismissed. \"At the very least,\" he said, \"we can't use current science as the standard for excluding the possibility of a more ad- vanced science.\" Dr. Trundle paints a virtual \"Men in Black\" picture of the ET scene in which several species are visiting the earth, most in a human form. But why? \"There are benign scenarios in which they might be seen as anthropologists coming here out of curiosity,\" he said. \"Then there is a more threatening sce- nario, which is that they're studying to see if the earth is habitable. An even more worrisome possibility is that they have a hybrid program of sexually mating with humans to strengthen then- species.\" - Thanks to David Wecker."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"Reptilian perspective, Part 2: present-day reports Serpents of wisdom... or snakes in the grass? Bev Trout By Beverly Trout MUFONIowa State Director Last month I discussed some of the legends and stories that show the ser- pent as a heavily perceived presence in mankind's past in ancient cultures all over the planet. Now, of course, it is the many modem, present-day reptilian reports from abductees that are of great concern, and that excite the most comment and the most fear in the human population. Not too surpris- ing, of course, since for the most part, my guess is that the closest approach most of us allow ourselves to the ser- pent species is to watch Steve Irwin, the gentleman on Cable TV's Animal Planet, as he rather gleefully interacts with rep- tilian life as the camera rolls, with the cameraman sometimes finding it neces- sary to jump back out of the way. And I'm glad when the cameraman nimbly avoids the possible negative re- sult of an encounter with a reptile being photographed, but it's a strong reminder that \"jumping back out of the way\" doesn't seem to be a choice given to today's abductees in their close encoun- ters with reptilians. I've run into several cases which could illustrate the variety of abduction expe- riences in which reptilians are involved, but in order to allow further exposition of my own reptilian perspective, let me focus on only one incident that occurred last Fall to an abductee whom I've known, for several years, and who has interacted with reptilians in the past. I'll call this young man, \"Jack.\" Jack and his \"significant other\" were sleeping peacefully one night when Jack, hearing a sound from the adjoining bath- room area, awoke to see a reptilian head- ing for his significant other, who was still sleeping peacefully beside him in the bed. Instantly, Jack sat up in bed, pointed a finger to the door and telepathically shouted, \"STOP! You are not allowed into this space!\" At this point, apparently something gave this particular reptilian pause. He stopped, retreated about three feet and \"stood\" or \"hovered\" just inside the bath- room as if watching and waiting to see whether Jack was strong enough to pre- vent him from reaching his bed partner. Then a thought stream permeated Jack's mind: \"Call out to the Archangel Michael.\" Instantly, he did, silently, tele- pathically, but succinctly and exactly stat- ing the need for intervention and the ac- tion desired. (As you read on, please keep in mind Jack's part in this sce- nario.) At this point, a beam of light energy entered the room, and from it came a shape, a shape holding a long rod of light that was at least seven feet high (from the floor to the ceiling) and confronted the reptilian. Jack's perception was that the reptil- ian shrieked, and then completely dissi- pated. Then, the shape returned to the light beam, and the beam retracted from the bedroom. Now, there are a couple aspects of this incident that we can explore a bit further. It should be noted that Jack is, as I said, an abductee himself, and as he em- phasized to me, \"Bev, I've had interac- tion with reptilians for years, and it's been okay; it hasn't been too scary, but I knew that this particular individual meant no good.\" I pass on Jack's remark to show that he was not lumping all reptilians into one single \"deify\" or \"demonize\" category. He was cognizant of the differences in individuals. Then Jack and I got into a discussion of the \"Archangel Michael\" part of the episode, and the pillar of light which MUFON UFO Journal seemed to appear in response to Jack's extremely urgent request. Was it, in fact, an \"angel\" of sorts? Or could it have been some aspect of Jack himself which became activated, seemingly outside his physical self, yet perhaps stemming from his explicitly rec- ognized need-and his ability to explicitly state his desire for action? I think we can at least consider the potential power of the energy known as the \"Kundalini,\" an energy that Jack, him- self, may have set in motion and allowed to come into play in this incident-the Kundalini being an energy that Hindus have long pointed to as extremely pow- erful, and that now we Westerners also talk about. Long after I suggested to Jack that some component of himself may have engineered the dissipation of the reptil- ian, I chanced to read Dr. Richard Sauder's book, Kundalini Tales, and I was astounded to read the following: \"Perhaps it would make sense to think of the Kundalini as some kind of arch- angel, vastly and consciously powerful, able to engineer entke galaxies; but at the same time capable of interacting in an intensely personal way with individual human beings.\" What is this powerful Kundalini en- ergy-this energy that has been associ- ated with the human body's own endo- crine gland system? Could it be a factor in the exploration and development of that \"common denominator\" that Ingo Swann talked about more than a decade ago in Fate Magazine! Swann described what he considered to be the common denominator shared by humans and aliens as being psychic communication and scanning by the aliens, which has been reported in most abductee reports. He very reasonably points out that aliens could not communicate with us unless we humans also possess a psy- chic substructure through which such communication can take place. OCTOBER 2004"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"In other words, we are all wired for this shared communication; we do have a common psychic denominator with the aliens; and that exploring this potential more fully within ourselves could effect a change in our-relationship with the aliens. How does it activate? How might it be activated? I suspect you could get various sug- gestions and various answers to these questions. Recommendations might run the gamut from hours of meditation to various exercises to help you relax and focus on this powerful energy which is wired into our capabilities, but which re- quires a powerful switch to turn it on- and I'm sure that many of the recom- mended practices or systems of ap- proach can be very effective. My own take, a recommendation I make to myself, as well as to others, is that Kundalini has a better opportunity to creatively activate if we as humans are willing to undertake a constant and ever-increasing questioning into our will- ingness to face reality, whether in emer- gency situations such as Jack faced, or in the routine, mundane, everyday events that we encounter. Facing reality, however, involves fac- ing our own fear, and I am not here speaking of WHAT we fear; I am, rather, speaking of facing fear itself without trying to use thought to escape from it. If Jack, in the midst of feeling fear, had resorted to trying to escape that fear by attempting to \"think\" his way out of it instead of facing it, I'd not like to think what might have happened with that par- ticular reptilian presence in the bedroom. We can admit, I think, that we humans are apt to try to escape fear sometimes by setting up an escape thought pattern, which unfortunately then serves to dis- tract us from facing reality, from facing the specific now that Jack seems to have understood in his encounter with the rep- tilian. Now, you may well ask, what does a discussion of fear and the Kundalini en- ergy have to do with a reptilian perspec- tive? Ironically, in considering the pos- sible activation of Kundalini energy on Jack's part, we have just come full circle in our discussion of a possible reptilian connection to humans. Because at this point we need to re- mind ourselves that this Kundalini en- ergy-which operates through what are known as \"Chakras\" or centers at vari- OCTOBER 2004 ous locations in the human body-has been called by other names as well, one of them being \"SERPENT ENERGY,\" this same serpent energy being that which has been referred to as associ- ated with the human body's endocrine gland system. Wherever the \"pillar of light energy\" emanated from in Jack's case, it had the desired effect on Jack's emergency situ- ation, and my sense is that Jack, him- self, had a huge role in resolving the situ- ation. As a corroborative footnote to this particular incident, under subtle question- ing the following morning, Jack found that his bed partner had been disturbed by dreaming there was an intruder in the house. One of my own experiences at the age of puberty was of being taken from a hayfield and brought on board a craft where a reptilian was clearly in charge of grays, apparently so they could carry out a surgical procedure involving an apparently malfunctioning implant which had caused swelling in my brain. Another incident at a much younger age involved an implant at the top of my spine, with my mind acknowledging that a \"cobra\" was associated with this device's ability to monitor me. For someone like myself who's not too comfortable around reptiles, it's not the greatest image to carry around with me. And, of course, I can be, and at times have been, exasperated, frus- trated, and fearful of the reptilian pres- ence, as I think most abductees have. But it is useful for me to acknowl- edge that if I harbor anger toward the aliens, and that anger evolves 1 or to put it another way, actually deteriorates into demonizing, or on the other hand if that anger devolves into an emotionally-des- perate 180-degree about face and I start to deify, then I'm in trouble. MUFON UFO JOURNAL I throw away the ability to be objec- tive; I've taken a long and dangerous step away from facing reality. I'm certainly not trying to say that I'm comfortable in any alien presence. I've never discovered any fun and games at- tached to these experiences. But I cannot find any creative answer to alien-human interaction if I respond in either a \"deify\" or \"demonize\" mode. It's useful to remind ourselves that in either the deify or demonize mode, we fix ourselves in a locked position, focus- ing on a locked/fixed image of the aliens, and setting the stage for indulging in a blame game-either scapegoating the aliens for our confusion and misdeeds, or....oddly enough....in the deify mode, giving the aliens credit for our spiritual development. Deify or demonize-in either case it's as if we want to tag the aliens as First Cause, whether good or whether bad. All of which leads away from objectiv- ity, leads away from reality, leads away from our own accountability. As far as I can tell: To deify blocks change. To demonize blocks change. As to the \"common denominator\" Ingo Swann talked about in 1992, hav- ing once been involved in the horse busi- ness, and having witnessed the consid- erable ill treatment humans are capable of foisting onto this particular life form, it has long been my contention that if horses could talk, we humans would in- teract with them on a much different level-showing more respect, as it were, for these \"talking horses,\" which to hu- mans represent \"another life form.\" Taking that analogy into the alien-hu- man interaction arena where we humans represent \"another life form\" to the aliens, I believe that we humans, in or- der to more creatively interact with our- selves AND with the aliens, must be- come those \"talking horses.\""},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"Ohio deputy &wife apparently see same UFO from different locations Kenny Young By Kenny Young On Wednesday, June 16,2004, a vet- eran deputy sheriff in Lake County, OH, and his wife observed an unusual trian- gular-shaped aircraft from two separate vantage points at nearly the same time. The husband and couple discussed their experience in detail the following after- noon. The wife reported sighting the bizarre aircraft at a closer vantage point and with more dramatic detail, spotting this un- usual object while driving east along State Route 91 near the State Route 91 and 306 intersections nearWilloughby Hills, OH (Lake County). Deputy Sher- iff Kevin Coleman sought to report the two sightings to the National UFO Center, advising of the situation in a comprehensive sum- mary on the N.U.F.O.R.C.'s \"online re- port form.\" Separately, the witness was also con- tacted by telephone on Wednesday, June 23,2004 for additional follow-up. Coleman advised that he holds a po- sition as deputy sheriff with the Lake County Sheriff's Department, and will see his 11th year of service this month. He was promoted to detective within three years of joining the staff, has in- vestigated all types of crimes, and is a veteran SWAT member. He has also in- vestigated plane crashes in the vicinity. Deputy Sheriff Coleman reports that the high-flying object he saw traveling from west to east on June 16 was noth- ing he was familiar with. The object was apparently higher than a jet airliner that was also seen flying through the area. Most interestingly, according to the witness, was how this unidentified ob- ject seemed to be self-luminous. He explains, \"I was concerned to find out if this object was just reflecting sun- 10 light. But after studying this for the length of time that I could, it did not seem to change in intensity or seem to be reflect- ing light in any way. \"It had an angular shape to it, giving me the impression that it was self-lumi- nous. In my opinion, it was self-luminous. \"It was definitely traveling in the east- erly direction of the Perry nuclear plant when I first saw it. Then this thing seemed to slow down and get bigger. The object was just 'gone,' not accelerating or flying off somewhere; it simply dis- appeared. I had a good visual on it, there was no question about it moving off.\" When asked further about its depar- ture method or how sure he was of this observation, Coleman affirmed his cer- tainty that the object did not depart in a conventional sense. \"This was, without question, the hard- est part for me to explain about the situ- ation.. . was how it was gone. I mean it was just gone.\" Coleman said that the duration of his sighting was between 10 and 20 seconds from the time he first noticed the object traveling from west to east and increas- ing in apparent size to the point of its apparent disappearance. The near-simultaneous sighting by Coleman's wife of a boomerang-shaped aircraft hovering only 100-feet from the ground was far more dramatic, accord- ing to Coleman, and the duration of that sighting was over one minute, discontin- ued due to traffic. First viewed to her right and in a northerly direction, Coleman's wife thought the object was some type of military aircraft that was possibly in a holding pattern. \"My wife thought this plane was somehow related to the events of Sept. 11, or even in some kind of investigation related to 911,\" Coleman said. \"What made this really interesting is that she was looking out her window to her right, which would be in a northerly direction, which would have generally been the same direction as my sighting,\" he said. When asked if he notified any other MUFON UFO Journal police agencies of the sighting, he said that he did not, only filing the report with NUFORC. Coleman was asked what his thoughts were about bringing this situa- tion to the attention of Homeland Secu- rity personnel, or if he feels there is any need for concern due to the uncertain nature of the UFO and its June 16 prox- imity to the Perry Nuclear Power Sta- tion. \"The concept of a huge, hovering, abnormal aircraft doesn't register with us to take action on,\" he said. \"I don't know what this thing was, but it was far outside the scope of our routine training or duty. This did not seem to be an ac- tionable situation. What I saw was not traditional.\" When Deputy Sheriff Coleman was asked if he had any objection to his name being listed in this report, he said, \"I have no objection to my name being used. This is a subject that is not a hobby to me; my interest in this is simply reporting the truth about this matter. I believe I have been affected by this, and nobody has given a reasonable explanation for it.\" Comment: The Perry Nuclear Power Plant is situ- ated on the Lake Erie shore about 35 miles northeast of Cleveland and between 8 and 10 miles northeast of the June 16 UFO sighting location. On June 22 it was an- nounced that the power station will un- dergo stepped-up scrutiny due to equip- ment breakdowns and other issues. j The plant had been shut down on May 21 due to equipment malfunction, sev- eral weeks before the UFO sighting. In March of 1988 a dramatic UFO sighting took place at the northernmost point of Route 91 (known as the Eastlake UFO Case), where Coast Guard offic- ers and civilian witnesses watched a UFO over Lake Erie. Several smaller objects were alleged to have advanced from the large UFO over the lake, and one smaller UFO was seen near the Perry Nuclear Power Plant.

OCTOBER 2004"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"An inventor, not an entrepreneur Nikola Tesla: the unappreciated genius By Harry Goldman I n 1897, a tall figure appeared at the entrance of a banquet hall filled with electrical engineers. As he approached the crowded area, a guest stood with glass in hand and toasted \"electricity, electricity, electricity.\" The hall resounded with enthusiastic ap- plause. The man to whom the toast was directed was Nikola Tesla. Earlier in the decade, a well-known electrical journal issued daily bulletins known as \"extra editions\" carrying a brief account of Tesla's life. So great was the interest in Tesla's experiments that more than four thou- sand copies of the journal were sold on the streets. This was, at the time, un- precedented in the history of electrical journalism. Tickets to a Tesla lecture sold for a hefty $5. Arthur Brisbane, dean of Hearst newspaper editors, declared Tesla \"Our Foremost Electrician ...Greater Even than Edison.\" Tesla had been the discoverer of the rotating magnetic field, and the inventor of the alternating current induction mo- tor; two contributions which led to the electrification of the civilized world. Why, then, are electrical utility power stations named after Thomas Edison? Unlike Edison, who marketed his own inventions, Tesla made little effort at en- trepreneurship. While Edison invented gadgets customers could purchase off store shelves, Tesla invented devices or made discoveries that advanced science. Rarely, for example, does the general public purchase induction motors as a single product. However, many products purchased are powered by Tesla induc- tion motors. Think Tesla the next time your refrig- erator comes on, when you do your laun- dry, when you use a fan or air condi- tioner, and so on. The general public knows little of the history of radio, except, perhaps, to agree that it was Marconi who invented it. Nikola Tesla In 1891, Nikola Tesla presented a lec- ture on resonant circuits. Resonant or tuned circuits are very important in ra- dio communications. Emile Girardeau, French pioneer in radio and radar, re- vealed, \"When it was recognized (by oth- ers) that the application of resonance to wireless telegraphy was a capital inven- tion, a number of detractors became in- furiated against the work of Tesla.\" In 1893, Tesla demonstrated a four- circuit system of wireless communica- tions. It consisted of two tuned circuits in the transmitter, and two tuned circuits in the receiver-all four circuits tuned to the same frequency. Tesla's four-circuit arrangement became the accepted defi- nition of wireless telegraphy. An analysis of Tesla's method reveals a discovery of the principle of inductive coupling between the driving and work- ing circuits, the importance of tuning both circuits to a common frequency, the idea of an oscillation transformer, and the employment of a capacitance-loaded open secondary. Tesla was among the first to under- stand the role of an elevated capacitance (antenna) grounded at one end. Guglielmo Marconi had little success in wireless communications until he adopted Tesla's arrangement. His appli- cation for a patent was rejected because the patent included just about every prin- ciple that Tesla had already publicly dis- closed. A second attempt to patent a four- circuit system of wireless was also re- jected. It wasn't until the patent exam- iner had retired that his application was accepted. In 1901, Marconi captured the atten- tion of the world when sending a wire- less message across the Atlantic. No one seemed to recognize, or care, that Marconi had stood on Tesla's shoulders to achieve his success. In 1915, the Marconi Co. took the U.S. Government to court over infringe- ments of its wireless patents. The suit lasted until the October terms of 1942 and 1943 when the Supreme Court de- About the author Harry Goldman is a retired science teacher with 28 years experience in the New York State public school sys- tem.

His essay, \"Tesla's Bold Adventure,\" appeared in the March 1971 issue of American West and later read into The Congressional Record.

OCTOBER 2004 MUFON UFO JOURNAL 11"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"clared the Marconi four-circuit wireless patent invalid because of prior disclosure by Tesla. Stone, and Lodge. For Tesla, the recognition came too late. On the other hand, Marconi had sold his patent rights and was laughing all the way to the bank. In 1896, Tesla devised a method of controlling moving objects by radio waves, and installed his system in a sub- mersible boat. Tesla's transmitter and re- ceiver utilized two frequencies. This fea- ture reduced the chance of interference by other transmitting stations. He foresaw his \"wireless torpedo\" as having great military value. \"We will be able...to send a projectile at a much greater distance; it will not be limited in any way-weight or amount of explosive charge. We shall be able to submerge it at command, to arrest it in flight and call it back, and to send it out again and ex- plode it at will; and more than this, it will never make a miss.\" But to Tesla, this was but the tip of the iceberg. He proposed radio-controlled robots capable of think- ing for themselves, \"...it will be able to follow a course laid out in advance; it will be capable of distinguishing between what it ought to do and what it ought not to do....\" Tesla was ridiculed for proposals which science considered impossible to achieve, but time has proven Tesla to have been correct. It was during those investigations that Tesla discovered the principle of the logic gate circuit, which later became an es- sential part of computer systems. Engi- neers seeking patents for logic gate cir- cuits in computer systems have been frustrated to find that Tesla had been their and done that. This article is but the tip of the ice- berg. Other inventions include Tesla's particle beam weapon, the U.S. Government's World War II program \"Project Nick,\" Tesla's views on \"Talk- ing with the Planets,\" etc. But by the 1920s and 1930s Tesla was penniless and forgotten. Only on the oc- casion of a birthday anniversary did the media give him attention. But its focus on the old man was more to ridicule than to pay tribute. By that time Tesla had been reduced to a babbling idiot telling his guests of the great inventions and discoveries he was working on. Unfortunately, the man is remembered more for what he said in 12 This is an artist's conception of a proposed Tesla airship devoid of wings, propellers, etc. Note the simi- larity to reports of cigar-shaped UFOs. (From the October, 1919 is- sue of Electrical Experimenter.) his declining years than for what he con- tributed during the prime of his life. With more than 100 patents to his credit, and with so many scientific achievements linked to his name, why has Tesla been omitted or just briefly mentioned in science textbooks? One reason may be his failure to pro- duce the many inventions he promised would someday benefit society. Leland I. Anderson, a leading Tesla historian, provides another possible rea- son. \"There is a conspiracy to suppress Tesla's image by those terrified to show his greatness and thereby diminish then- own heroes. Interest in Tesla is waning because a few historians in high places are waging a concerted effort to see that Tesla is not accorded his due.\" Anderson's claim shows merit when considering that institutions such as the Smithsonian, the National Museum of American History and Technology, the Institution of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, and others have omitted or diminished Tesla's place in electrical his- tory. Bernard Finn, Curator of the Division of Electricity and Physics at the National Museum of American History and Tech- nology, completely omitted Tesla's name MUFON UFO Journal in his paper \"The Beginning of the Elec- trical Age.\" Approximately 45 contributors were named, some of whom were relatively insignificant. Another example to be cited is a pa- per by Dr. James E. Brittain appearing in the Journal of Economic History (March 1974). Titled \"The International Diffusion of Electrical Power Technology, 1870-1920,\" the very first sentence reads, \"Some of the factors which influ- enced the international diffusion of the Gramme dynamo, the Edison dynamo, the revolving-field alternator.and the Alexan-derson alternator will be exam- ined in this paper.\" Notice that Brittain connected a name with every invention but Tesla's rotating field discovery. It appears that Brittain has amnesia where Tesla is concerned. Another reason why history and en- gineering societies have distanced them- selves from Tesla may be due to the cult status achieved through public adoration. Amateur historians, it seems, have gone bonkers in crediting Tesla with discov- eries with which he had no connection. Not long ago, I read a paper in which the authors attempted to connect a Tesla experiment with the great Tunguska in- cident. Scientists believe that in 1908 a fall- ing body from space (meteor, bolide, etc.) landed in a Siberian forest. The damage created by the fiery object turned miles upon miles of forest trees into giant matchsticks. At that time, no human could possibly release such an amount of energy. It is not uncommon to hear Tesla's name being entered in conversations dur- ing the nighttime radio talk shows. Time and again, I've heard such statements as \"Tesla did that,\" \"just like Tesla,\" or some similar remark giving credit for something with which Tesla had no con- nection. Probably the crowning insult occurred when a lecturer attached Tesla's name to the controversial Philadelphia Experi- ment. During World War II, the U.S. Navy is alleged to have undertaken an electrical experiment which caused a ship to disappear. According to the speaker, members of the crew were able to pass through steel bulkheads. Some, however, did not make it all the way through and were frozen into the steel walls.

Incidentally, Tesla's name is not listed in the index of the Moore and Berlitz book, Philadel- phia Experiment. You may be wondering why an ar- ticle on Nikola Tesla is appearing in the MUFON Journal. That's because Nikola Tesla has erroneously been linked to the UFO controversy. In 1971, Arthur H. Matthews, son of British scientist Grindell H. Matthews, published a book Nikola Tesla and the Venusian Space Ship X-12. Among the numerous incorrect and absurd statements made, Tesla is alleged to have said that \"he believed he came from the planet Venus.\" Nothing of the sort appears in Tesla's autobiography. I'm sure that Mr. and Mrs. Tesla would have been appalled had they read Mr. Matthews' book. I once wrote to Mr. Matthews requesting more informa- tion as to the source of his claims. Matthews did not respond. The publication to hit the lowest rung on the ladder is Margaret Storm's Re- turn of the Dove. This example of oc- cult mysticism was \"predicted it will ex- cel anything in movie history.\" My ad- vice to the person making that predic- tion is never to bet on a horse race. A recent report in the MUFON UFO Journal attempted to tie a crop circle formation with a Tesla invention. Again, I ask, what invention was that? How about a patent number, a science paper, a Tesla lecture, etc., which might reveal such a fabulous invention? I must concede, however, that if any- one could resolve the mystery of the UFO, it would be Tesla. He once spoke of the possibility of flying objects devoid of wings, propellers, etc. One of Tesla's visions included a fly- ing torpedo. A magazine carried an il- lustration that linked Tesla's proposal with a cigar-shaped flying object (previ- ous page), not unlike reports of a UFO mother ship. He once said, \"You should not be at all surprised if some day you see me fly from New York to Colorado Springs in a contrivance which will resemble a gas stove and weigh as much.\" Tesla claimed it would be small enough to enter and depart through a window. So, if you see a flying object similar in shape to a gas stove you can rightfully exclaim : \"Just like Tesla.\" OCTOBER 2004 Kentucky Earle Benezet Kentucky MUFON first to have booth at a state fair By Earle Benezet State Director of Kentucky MUFON Apparently for the first time in the history of MUFON a chapter has had representation at a state fair. This year I set up a booth at the Kentucky State Fair in Louisville with the assistance of 27 individuals over the course of the 11 days of the fair, Aug. 19-29. It was a lot of work, since the fair is open from 9 AM to 10 PM each day, but it was quite worthwhile. We spoke to literally thousands of people. Many others walked past, saw the word UFO, and smiled a cute smug smile, like they knew it all, and kept walking. We garnered 220 names, addresses, and emails of people wanting more in- formation or who wanted to come to meetings we hold in either Louisville, Covington, or Lexington. We.spoke to engineers, architects, PhDs, NASA employees, secretaries, bookkeepers, factory workers, carpen- ters, lawyers, retired people, and many more professions. We had two 17\" monitors which were showing a number of powerpoint pre- sentations I had made over the past year MUFON UFO JOURNAL which included: UFO's, Past, Present and Future, Crop Circles Decoded, Alien Abductions, Mars Anomalies Past & Present, Alternative Energies Currently Being Developed, Forbidden Archeol- ogy, and Kentucky UFO Sightings Past & Present. We also had a 20\" TV which was playing VHS tapes of different interest- ing videos, one of which was \"Evidence, The Case For NASA UFOs.\" We also had a number of handouts, applications to join MUFON, a large list- ing of sites to look at, and an informa- tional handout from John Schuessler ex- plaining about MUFON. We also had an order form for the MUFON 2004 International UFO Symposium Proceedings, and an order form for the MUFON UFO Journal. Since this was a success I now find that Ohio MUFON and Indiana MUFON and also Michigan are think- ing of having a booth at their respective state fairs also next year.

Reviewed by Dwight Connelly It is impossible not to be impressed by the size and depth of this book, as well as the obvious intel- lect of the author. Von Ward's cre- dentials are indeed impressive: graduate degrees in govern- ment and psychology from Harvard and Florida State Uni- versity, a former Naval officer, a former diplomat, multi- lingual experience in 100 countries, a member of Mensa, founder of the non- profit Delphi International, and more. His two previous books are Govern- ment of the People and Our Solarian Legacy: Multidimensional Humans in a Self-Learning Universe. The major concepts in this book are not new-the visitation of this planet by extraterrestrials in early human history and the aftereffects of this contact-but Von Ward provides more details, more cross references, and more depth than previous works on the subject. The author call s these non-human en- tities ABs, or Advanced Beings, and sug- gests that these beings not only shaped the course of human history thousands of years ago, but are still with us. These ABs, he says, \"may have pow- ers of communication unknown to hu- mans and operate in realms not readily available to us,\" and \"may have the power to unilaterally decide when and how to speak to us.\" However, he contends that \"none of this means they are necessarily more in- telligent or more morally and ethically developed than humans.\" While Von Ward covers virtually ev- ery significant aspect of human history MUFON UFO Journal in considerable detail-speech, writing, mathematics, etc.-this is essentially a book about religion: how it developed, how it has been misused over the centu- ries, and what we should do about it. Von Ward notes that \"90 percent of the world's population has a religious outlook based on some kind of mythol- ogy-God the Father and so on-and that the standard scientific view gives these myths as much credibility as the tooth fairy....There's an enormous split be- tween reason and meaning that must be healed.\" Very early in the book (the Introduc- tion, in fact), the author presents his the- sis: \"Somewhere along the way, the founders of modern Judaism, Christian- ity, Islam, and ah 1 their offshoots had con- vinced their followers that a supernatu- ral god had chosen them as its special representatives on Earth. \"They had further asserted that their god was the True Supreme God of the Universe. They went so far as to claim that their religion was the only valid chan- nel for humanity to connect with that god.\" Von Ward suggests that if humans are shown \"that the UFO/ET phenomenon was part of our ordinary reality, they would take the next step and realize that similar phenomena in history were also part of ordinary reality. \"They would see through the super- natural fiction of just two millennia of Indo-European history. The whole ba- sis of privilege and authority on which modern power structures exist would be undermined. \"Their control of economic resources, including the financing of science and education to maintain blinders on human consciousness would be threatened.\" The fear of loss of control, according to the author, is a major reason that gov- ernment is covering up the current pres- ence of extraterrestrials-as well as the role of extraterrestrials in human devel- opment. Von Ward's contention is that ABs came to the Earth, colonized it for their OCTOBER 2004"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"own purposes, and intervened with hu- man development through mating with humans or through genetic manipulation, or both. These visitors from space were sub- stantially more highly developed than humans, and were thus treated as gods. In fleshing out this thesis in more than 400 pages, the author consults numer- ous sources: Sumerian Cuneiform clay tablets, the Jewish-Christian Bible, and the spoken and written myths of numer- ous civilizations, from India to the Ameri- cas. He contends that, while no one source is the ultimate proof of historical inter- actions between humans and ABs, the great mass of evidence indicates that the interactions did occur. It may be a bit troubling to some read- ers that a few of Von Ward's sources seem weak. For example, channeling, which has not proven itself to the satis- faction of many researchers, is used as one source of information. Likewise, references to Pleiadian metaphysical reports of AB colonization of Earth will not impress all readers. Some of the modern sources, such as Dr. Steven Greer and Col. Philip Corso, are no better. In addition to the use of questionable sources, it appears Von Ward has, de- spite the length of this book, not used all of the significant sources. For example, he relies very heavily on the work of Zecharia Sitchin in dis- cussing Sumerian Cuneiform tablets, but does not mention the significant work of Dr. Samuel Noah Kramer, who was a noted Sumerian scholar and curator of the tablet collection at the University of Pennsylvania. Dr. Kramer's History Begins at Sumer and other works cover some of the same material that Sitchin covers, but puts a different light on some occur- rences, such as the Flood. (Interestingly, both Sitchin and Kramer were born in Russia.) This is not to say that Sitchin is an unreliable source (although some would contend this), but only that Von Ward seems selective in some of his material in bolstering his particular viewpoint. It should be noted, however, mat even if Dr. Kramer's work was used as the primary source, it would not affect Von Ward's basic arguments regarding Earth's colonization by the Anunnaki- only some of the details and interpreta- OCTOBER 2004 tions. Despite shortcomings with some of the sources, the bottom line is that the author's overall presentation is impres- sive. For the most part Von Ward pre- sents his material in a logical and straight- forward manner, and, to his credit, points out that these sources strongly suggest certain things, rather than absolutely proving them. He presents a strong case against Darwin's evolution theory, as have oth- ers, such as Lloyd Pye in Everything You Know is Wrong. Von Ward notes the famous \"missing link\" between early humans and transi- tion humans that supporters of natural evolution have failed to find, as well as the overlap between different stages of human development! He also points to the evidence that ancient cities seemed to suddenly de- velop, not slowly evolve, and that the ancients in these areas had knowledge of such topics as astronomy that mod- ern man has only recently discovered. In tracing mankind's development, the author notes that \"fossil evidence un- earthed to date certainly does not dis- prove the AB-intervention hypothesis, and, in some important ways, it appears to corroborate it.\" His thesis, obviously presented in more detail in the book than is possible here, is that the reports in the Sumerian clay tab- lets are correct: the Anunnaki (AB/ET) \"allegedly took a brutish Earth being and mixed some of its genes with some of their own to produce a worker suitable for labor in their gold mines in Africa.\" Von Ward says that the available evi- dence indicates that these \"gods,\" ref- erenced in Sumerian sources, in the Old Testament, and in other sources, fought among themselves and did not agree on how humanity should develop-some wanting to keep humans as ignorant workers who obeyed the gods without question, and others wanting humans to gain knowledge and develop. From this disagreement among the gods may have come the story of the forbidden fruit from the Tree of Knowl- edge in the Garden of Eden, as well as the definition of sin and the devil. The author goes so far as to suggest that the god of the Hebrews, YHVH, was one of those gods who wanted to prevent the development of human knowledge and advancement. Von Ward concludes that \"global su- MUFON UFO JOURNAL pernaturalism,\" as expressed through or- thodox Judaism, Christianity, and Islam and their derivities, has passed through a succession of events: (1) The worship of the Anunnaki ABs while they were on Earth, (2) The emotional impact of the gods leaving Earth, causing humans to per- form rituals that would either eventually bring the gods back or connect humans and the gods in some manner, and (3) the subsequent use of these myths to keep certain human elements in posi- tions of power. Von Ward says the sequence was as follows: •The development of an absentee- AB-cult worship in the Middle East. •The existence of a Hebrew cult whose members claimed to worship the most powerful of the departed gods (YHVH). •A fresh and compelling myth that developed around Jesus, who attempted to reform the Hebrew cult. •The organization-building skills of Roman citizens, including Saul/Paul, who appropriated Jesus' name and reputation to create a Greco-Roman cult devoted to the concept of Christos as its god. •Enough political power left in a wan- ing government (Roman Empire) to el- evate that cult to the status of an empire's religion. •A council of bishops decision (Nicea) to cull from competing texts a Bible that largely excludes references to the reality of other ABs and Jesus' hu- manity. The author spends several pages dis- cussing the effects of this supernatural religion, including the ways in which ideo- logical divisions have caused conflict between the peoples of the world, such as the Crusades and modern terrorism- as well as slowing the development of the human race. Obviously there is much, much more in this large book-presented in a more compelling and detailed manner than possible in this brief review. Only by absorbing all of the material in this large and comprehensive book can a reader gain a true perspective of its content-a review is just not adequate, and may even be unfair to the author.

Kentucky flying triangle CORINTH - On Aug. 29, 2004, two college students were traveling back to the university on 1-75 about 3 miles from Corinth when they saw an ob- ject with lights on each tip that was switching pat- terns. The witness states, \"At 10:35 PM, my girlfriend and I looked up in the sky and no- ticed that straight ahead at about ten miles there was a bright light in the sky that was flying west across the horizon. The object flew across the horizon in about ten seconds and then stopped. \"After stopping, it then dropped out a dark bundle-like object. Soon after that, it turned and came towards us (south) rather quickly. There was no sound at all. We traveled about a mile down the road, and the object was almost instantly right in front of us and began to hover slowly over the top of us. \"We drove right under it, and saw it was triangular with one light on each point of the triangle. There was also a red light located next to one of the lights. After the object went over the top of us, I looked out of my sunroof behind me and the lights began to change into dif- ferent patterns. \"They began flashing and changing shapes, using red, blue, and yellowish lights. It was impossible to stop or turn around because of a median. But as we continued driving, I watched out of the sunroof of my Ford Explorer and no- ticed that it was still moving slowly over the interstate and then up a little.\" Thanks to Peter Davenport, Director, www.UFOCenter.com 16 Michigan flying triangle ANN ARBOR - On Thursday, Aug. 19,2004, at around 10 PM, the observer was driving home on the M-14 Express- way when he noticed a large bright ob- ject just over the trees up ahead. As he got closer, he saw three large circles with a flashing orange circle in the middle of a triangular pattern. He states, \"I was the only car on the westbound side of the expressway, so I slowed way down to around 15 mph to observe an object flying at 200 feet in altitude and just past the Gotfredson exit about fifty yards off the expressway. \"As I got closer and was more directly under it, I noticed that the intense lights were attached to the structure of a tri- angular-shaped object that was slightly darker than the night sky. It probably wasn't more than 30 feet deep. \"The lights did not throw any reflec- tion up to the structure and had no re- flective properties at all. Even the ground below was not lit up by any light. As bright as these lights were and how close it was to the ground, I couldn't under- stand why nothing was lit up. \"This flying triangle was large-about the size of a 747 or so. The ends of the triangle were blunted; they were not sharp. The object made no noise as it hovered over crop fields and woods. The craft was staying stock-still. \"I watched the object for two more minutes, and it never moved. The only motion was the orange light blinking in the middle of the three other lights.\" Thanks to Peter Davenport. Pennsylvania UFO affects TV POTTSTOWN - It was about 2:30 AM on Aug. 10,2004, and the non-cable TV channels kept getting very fuzzy. The witness noticed a strange flying object with different colors. He states, \"When I ran to my win- dow, I saw three yellow lights in a row, with the middle one a little bit lower than the other two. The object was making the TV go haywire with loud static, and MUFON UFO Journal a humming noise. The object was going straight up, not on a slant like airplanes. \"I called all the airports in my area, and there were no airplanes flying at that time. When the UFO was over my house my TVs went crazy, then as soon as it was gone they came back to normal op- eration.\" Thanks to Peter Davenport. Illinois teacher recalls 1923 UFO Len Wells, Courier and Press cor- respondent, writes: \"Mount Erie native Norman Massie dies at 91. He had taught school in Wayne County for 37 years, and once served as principal. While the folks in Southern Illinois will remember Coach Massie for his many years in education, perhaps the world will remember him for what he witnessed 81 years ago when he was just 10 years old. \"It was a warm day in June, 1923, when he saw what he was convinced until his last days was a spaceship. In a 1998 interview he told me, 'I opened the gate to let the horses into the pasture. I looked back down the field, and there was an object with lights all around it. I kept walking-closer to the object until I got about 50 feet away. I stood there and watched the five men who were on board.' \"I've heard Norman tell this story many times, and it was always the same- never embellished from one time to the next: 'The machine was metallic and stood on three legs. The top was a dome with holes in it. The best way I could describe the top was it looked like melted glass. I got close enough that I could hear them talk. One guy sat in a chair, and the others called him the commander. Four others made trips back and forth in the ship. I didn't know what was going on until the end. Then, one of the crew members told the commander that the repairs had been made.' \"Massie said the whole experience lasted about five minutes.

Both witnesses reported that they wit- nessed one, or more, bright lights that looked like fireworks, but with no tail, moving toward their building. Suddenly, the lights reportedly stopped, and turned into some type of unlighted ship, hover- ing motionless in the night sky. The first ship appeared to split into two seemingly similar-looking craft. Neither of the witnesses thought she had ever seen a UFO before. NUFORC found these witnesses to be quite sin- cere.

At 23:55 PM I noticed a white light that I assumed was an airplane climbing at a steep 45- degree angle as during take off. \"The craft then changed direction and dove toward the ground at a 45-degree, angle, stopping five feet from the ground and hovering. The craft was about 200 feet away from us across the northbound OCTOBER 2004 lanes. The craft was shaped like a sting ray with three white lights on the top. \"My wife first saw the maneuvers and the sting ray shape with three white lights. Two were at the outside flippers and one light was at the nose in front.

Atlantic Ocean beacon flashes On Aug. 30, 2004, at 10 PM, com- mercial pilots report, \"Twice in the last month over the Atlantic ocean at Flight Level 360 myself and my First Officer have witnessed a flashing beacon type light at orbital altitudes near the vicinity of the Big Dipper. \"The object appears to be very fast, based on the frequency of the flash and its location. I just want to know if we may have a satellite with some type of spin on it that would cause this sighting. I have not seen this type of flash from the many other satellites, etc., that I have seen over the years.\" Thanks to Peter Davenport. Note: No known satellite has flashing beacons.

Maine metallic circular object PISCATAQUIS COUNTY - The witness was watching TV at 6:30 PM on Aug. 28, 2004, when he looked out his bay window and saw a low-flying circular metallic object moving from the middle of the window to the left side. He reports, \"This is roughly south to north 50 to 75 feet higher than the treeline. I have heard of other lights and mysterious objects in the sky. It was a very bright, silver metallic color and was flying about 50 mph in a straight path until I lost sight of it.!' Thanks to Peter Davenport. New Jersey Loud Noises in the Sky GALLOWAY - The witness was awakened at 3:49 AM from a deep sleep by a loud noise approaching her home on Aug. 5,2004. As the noise grew nearer, the witness states, \"I tried to get up and couldn't at first; although Iwas conscious, I couldn't MUFON UFO JOURNAL get up. Finally, I was able to go to the window and could only see clouds over- head, but the sound was oscillating, a roaring noise hovering very near. \"By now my husband was awake, and he heard it too.

Rhode Island triangle & chopper WESTERLY - On Aug. 26, 2004, the witness was doing light cleaning when she heard a helicopter passing very low over her house. She looked up at 10:13 PM to see an Army-type chopper flying over, and noticed a second object pass above the helicopter. She reports, \"The object was flying east, and as it crossed the path of the helicopter it switched direction to north, and then was lost behind a group of trees. \"The object was an unmistakable tri- angle that was black in color with a flash- ing light at the point facing the rear. It had other lights along the bottom and sides, but they were not as bright. There was no sound apart from the noise of the chopper that I could detect.\" Thanks to Peter Davenport. Connecticut flying triangle MADISON - On Aug. 25, 2004, a business consultant with an MBA was renting a beach house on the shore. The witness reports, \"At 10 PM, my 14-year- old nephew and my 18-year-old babysitter were the first to see the UFOs. \"I arrived home with my 22-year-old niece at about 10:30 PM, and they were excited, having seen ten sparkling uni- dentified objects flying in the sky above Long Island Sound.

Several flew in triangle pat- terns and flew close to each other and crossed each other's flight paths. It looked like they might crash. \"Two flew very low over our heads, and we could see the bottom of one. It looked like a triangle with a light at each point when the objects flew over a low- flying helicopter.

Object in DC no-fly zone WASHINGTON, DC - The witness was out on the balcony of his sixth floor apartment on Aug. 31, 2004, inside the no-fly zone in Washington, DC, on a per- fectly clear day when he saw a contrail. His sister joined him on the balcony, and he pointed to the contrail. The witness states, \"I saw a large metallic object appear out of one cloud and realized that I could not distinguish any features that I would normally rec- ognize in a plane. \"I immediately said to her, 'What's that?' Both of us watched it for three to five seconds until it disappeared into an- other cloud. The diameter of the object was slightly larger than the full moon appears, and it was flying in a southeast- erly direction and ascending slightly. \"There was no sound. It was not com- pletely flat, and was a sort of gun metal color, maybe bordering closer to gold than silver. The object was not shiny and had texture to it. There was no sound, and there were no lights. \"My sister said immediately, 'That was the classic cigar shape.' She was right. This object was flying well within the no- fly zone and away from the traditional flight paths. On May 21, my sister and I saw balls of light moving furiously in a counterclockwise circle ten feet from our balcony windows.\" Thanks to Peter Davenport. North Carolina lights over park RALEIGH - At 9:30 PM the wit- nesses were at the park on Aug. 28,2004, when people started pointing at the sky. The reporting witness said there were \"three or four dim star-like objects that 18 at first I thought might be a shooting star, but they started moving in multiple di- rections, rapidly accelerating and chang- ing direction with no discernible purpose. I looked away to watch a band play at the park, and when I looked again, they were gone. \"The other twenty or so people who looked up and could spot them were amazed.\" Thanks to Peter Davenport. Kansas bright cylinder TOPEKA - On Aug. 25, 2004, the witness, a private pilot, reports, \"I observed a bright white or silver tube-shaped object flying from south to north just below the top, but up next to a wall, of dark storm clouds over Topeka at 6 PM. \"The object was about three times as long as it was wide, but the overall size was hard to judge. It was traveling at about the speed of an airplane, but after flying for a minute it stopped in the air and was stationary for a few minutes. \"The object was very visible against the darkness of the clouds, and I could see turbulence in the clouds being blown around it. The turbulence did not appear to affect it. The object then gradually faded away.\" Thanks to Peter Davenport. Arkansas flying cigar SOCIAL HILL - The witness re- ports seeing a flying cigar as he drove west on 1-30 at exactly the 92-mile marker at 11:50 PM on Aug. 25, 2004. He reports, \"The craft was going north towards Hot Springs, and it had two non- flashing lights on each end of the cigar-shaped craft. It was flying side- ways, like if an airliner was flying side- ways with no wings. \"The bottom was grayish black, and yellowish lights were reflecting off it- self, but not flashing. It was flying at 1500 to 2000 feet altitude, and there was a small light plane following it.

California shining object SAN JUAN BATISTA - The wit- nesses were driving on SR Hwy 101 on Aug. 31, 2004, at 8:45 PM, when they noticed a large shining object in the sky. One of the witnesses reports, \"It was very bright, like a star, but moving like a plane at first, and then a smaller bright object dropped out of the bottom of the MUFON UFO Journal craft and fell directly under it. \"We never saw a flash like a crash, it just disappeared from sight, but the larger object stayed in the area, and we finally drove further south and could no longer see it.\" Thanks to Peter Davenport. Washington trio NORDLAND - On Aug. 30, 2004, at 8:45 PM, a family observed three craft in formation at an excessive rate of speed flying at 150 to 200 feet above Puget Sound. The father reports, \"The two lead craft were about 100 feet apart, flying parallel, and the third craft was about 200 feet back in line with the craft on the left. \"We could not distinguish their shape due to the darkness.

England round and white object LONDON - The witness reports, \"We were in busy traffic on Finchley Road on Aug. 29, 2004, at 10:30 PM, when we saw a completely round ob- ject that stuck out like a sore thumb in the clear sky. \"The object was the brightest object in the sky, and glowed intensely white and then stayed like that for a good 15 sec- onds before fading out and disappearing from view.\" Thanks to Peter Davenport. Cigar shape over the UK ALDERSHOT - The sighting of a mystery object in the sky over the week- end has baffled passers-by, air traffic control experts, and Army officials. A couple spotted the object on Saturday Sept. 4, 2004, as they played with their sons in Aldershot Park. The cigar-shaped object appeared in the sky at about 2:15 PM and the family watched it ducking around for about 20 minutes. \"It caught our attention because it didn't move like an aircraft,\" said the mother. \"It was a shiny cylinder-shaped ob- ject with random moves, and it turned and flew horizontally, vertically, and di- agonally.\" The News received several other calls about sightings. The director of Farnborough International Airport Ann Bartaby said the object was noth- ing to do with them. The Army said, \"We were not flying any type of cylinder- shaped aircraft on Saturday afternoon.\" Thanks to Jim Hickman and Sky watch- International. OCTOBER 2004"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"By Stanton T. Friedman Stan Friedman Astronomy and ET Last month I wrote at length about the differences between myself and Dr. Seth Shostak of the SETI Institute, re- ferring to specifics from our debate on the Coast to Coast Radio show on July 21. Since then there have been a number of widely circulated stories relating to astronomy, some of which touch on vari- ous aspects of the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI). I, of course, prefer the Search for Ex- traterrestrial Vehicles (SETV), since I find over- whelming evi- dence that Earth is already being visited by ETs. I have also seen no evidence that there are civilizations within our galaxy using radio transmitters to send radio signals that we can intercept, just as we don't use smoke signals. One story almost made me wrong in an instant. The New Scientist Maga- zine of England published an article strongly suggesting that signals from ET had indeed already been received from some ill-defined location about 1,000 light years away. This caused some headlines and some discussions, and then was laid to rest by people like Dr. Shostak who indicated that the signals just didn't meet the SETI Community's standards. The reporter had obviously gone overboard. A second story dealt with the possible direct observation of a planet around a dwarf star more than 200 light years from Earth. The more than 120 planets already believed to have been discov- ered based on the wiggles they produce in the paths of the stars they orbit have OCTOBER 2004 not been directly observed. In addition, because of the lack of sensitivity of the techniques being used, they are all very large planets believed to be gaseous giants similar to Jupiter, rather than much smaller, much less massive rocky planets like Earth, Venus, Mercury, and Mars. The newly-observed planet (It might be a star on die line of sight to or beyond the observed star, but that is deemed not very likely) is still much larger than Earth, and orbits a long way from the dwarf star-and would be very cold indeed. It should be noted that often it has been claimed that dwarf stars would not have planets. Since they make up a sub- stantial fraction of all stars, absence of planets around them would reduce the expected number of planets in the Milky Way Galaxy. A point that should be made here is that often articles about the search for planets claim that finding them makes it more likely that there are other civiliza- tions in the galaxy. Obviously this is non- sense. It affects our thinking about such matters, often based on pure specula- tion, but certainly the planets are there or they are not. What we learn informs us, but doesn't change the universe. Another story which got considerable publicity was about the work of two sci- entists (Christopher Rose and Gregory Wright-Rutgers University, Nature, Aug 25) who suggested that rather than send- ing radio signals, it would be more effi- cient to send compacted information in a spaceship, because so much more in- formation, with new methods of data storage, could be sent in a relatively small package. A boat load of CDs would contain a huge amount of information compared to radio or laser signals looked for by optical SETI people. In response, Seth Shostak noted that while the information density could indeed be very high, per- haps using molecular information stor- age systems involving DNA or similar molecular devices, the \"envelope\" for the information letter would have to weigh MUFON UFO JOURNAL something. To reach a lot of receivers with the information, many rockets would have to be launched. They would take a long time to get to their targets, since the near- est, he claims, would be at least 100 light years away. No basis is given for this number. Considering that there would be about 8,000 stars within that distance of Earth, of which at least 400 would be similar to the Sun, that would make us very spe- cial indeed. Rose and Wright suggest we should be looking for information con- tainers rather than signals. Seth makes a reasonable argument, if one accepts his assumptions, that maybe signals would be better. Neither considers interstellar travel for intelligent beings. That we are very special seems to be of extraordinary importance to the SETI community. From their viewpoint the fewer transmitters there are out there, and the farther away the nearest sender, the longer we will have to search and listen and listen and listen for radio sig- nals or look for very powerful, very brief laser bursts. Thus the greater the job security for SETI Specialists. I will give him credit for noting the job interest of SETI Specialists in his newly-published article in the online jour- nal Acta Astronautica. He says that many comments about how soon signals will be found seem to be based on the years to retirement of the claimant. In this article, using the best SETI Community Techniques, he assumes 10,000 to 1 million transmitters in the galaxy, and that therefore the nearest would be 1,000 light years away. Since our listening skills are growing rapidly, based on constantly improving electronics, we should be getting a sig- nal within about 20 years. Note here that he is assuming that aliens are not using more advanced tech- niques than those which we have. Since there are about 200 billion stars in the galaxy, this also leads to the extraordi- nary conclusion that only 1 in 200,000 (1 19"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"million of 200 billion stars) has transmit- ting capability. Surely makes us special. From my viewpoint I would say a bet- ter bet would be 10 billion civilizations in the galaxy more advanced than ours because there has been so much time for the early birds to migrate and colo- nize, rather than expecting each to de- velop on its own independently. Nowhere is there allowance made in the SETI bible for colonization or migra- tion or visitation to Earth, since \"they\" must be so far away .No data is pre- sented to support these conclusions. More dart board physics. Another fascinating article appeared in the Cincinnati Enquirer Aug. 15, 2004, entitled \"Universe is Really, Re- ally Big\" by Dean Regus, the outreach astronomer at the Cincinnati Observa- tory Center. He lists the distances from the Earth to the Moon (240,000 miles); then Mars (35 million miles-when closest); then the Sun (93 million miles); Saturn (800 mil- lion miles); Pluto (3 billion miles); Proxima Centauri (nearest star to the Sun- 4.2 light years, or about 25 trillion miles); then the Andromeda Galaxy (2.9 million light years); and the edge of the universe 14 billion light years. I won't quarrel with his distances, but then he tells us how long it takes to get to most of these locations. Here he has serious difficulties, at least from my viewpoint. He doesn't tell us the numerous as- sumptions he makes to get a transit time to the Moon of 3 days (about what it took Apollo), 7 months to Mars (what our landers and orbiters have taken), Saturn 7 years (What the Cassini space- craft now exploring that area took to get there), and Pluto with a trip time of 10- 15 years. He then concludes, \"With our current technology it would take a spacecraft 77,000 years to reach Proxima and Al- pha Centauri.\" The last number assumes that the time to Proxima would have the same ratio to the time to Pluto as the ratio of the distances. Funny, when I lived in California it would sometimes take me less time to fly to the San Francisco airport from Los Angeles than for my wife to drive there from 30 miles away. One suits the tech- nique to the journey at hand. Does he really believe that we have already developed the ultimate space travel techniques i.e. dumb old chemical 20 rockets barely able to get off the Earth with a huge rocket?? We are in the infancy of the space age. He also doesn't seem to understand that everything depends on the approach taken. For example, the Apollo flights in- volved about 17 minutes of powered flight, with the rocket slowing down (coasting) continually until it got close enough to the moon for the moon's gravi- tational field to pull it in. Its average speed is 3,300 miles per hour, even though it was going 25,000 mph when it left the Earth. Arthur C. Clarke pointed out many years ago that if one doubled the velocity at burnout, it would cut the trip time to the moon by a factor of 20. Sound incredible? There are only three forces acting on the pay load: the thrust of the propellant exiting the nozzle, the downward acceleration of gravity (1G or about 21 miles per hour per sec- ond or about 1,260 miles per hour per minute) and, within the atmosphere, the drag of the atmosphere. The astronauts accelerate at as much as 5Gs to get to orbit quickly to reduce the impact of Earth's gravity. The net force moving them towards the moon is the difference between gravity pulling down and propellant pushing up. Small improvements on the propulsion side lead to considerable increase in the difference between thrust and gravity's downward pull. The rocket moves up very slowly at the beginning because the thrust up isn't much larger than the weight. As more propellant is burned, the weight de- creases and the net upward effect in- creases. Almost all of our deep space probes use cosmic freeloading to increase ve- locity using the gravitational fields of various space bodies. Cassini went past Venus, then the Earth, and then Jupiter to get its free kicks toward Saturn. Contrary to his assumptions, we know that, for example, a nuclear fission up- per stage has twice the thrust per pound as does a chemical one. Such engines were tested back in the 1960s. We further know that a nuclear fu- sion (the process producing the energy in the Sun and all other stars) rocket can exhaust particles having 10 million times as much energy per particle as does a chemical rocket. We know that proper flight paths can allow one to use the MUFON UFO Journal gravitational field of the Sun and other stars. We know that the hydrogen and he- lium used in a nuclear fusion rocket to produce very energetic charged par- ticles, to be electro-magnetically guided out the back end, are the most abundant elements in the universe. We know that to extend the range of a number of high performance aircraft, we have been using aerial refueling for decades. We know that ships of the Brit- ish Navy over 100 years ago were using remote coaling stations in the Atlantic to refuel themselves, rather than depend- ing on carrying along sufficient fuel for the planned trips. Most important of all, we know that Technological Progress comes from do- ing things differently in an unpredictable way. And we know that there will be pro- pulsion systems (and communication de- vices) out there, operated by civilizations much more advanced than are we, that use techniques (anti-gravity? space time warping? energy of the vacuum? grav- ity waves? neutrinos?) about which we are now totally ignorant. Remember that on our 4.5 billion-year- old planet we have had knowledge of the nucleus, of rocketry, of flight, and of electronics for less than 125 years. Surely we can't consider us the Crown of Creation. -Stan Friedman fsphys@rogers.com Ohio State research indicates body features can affect aggression Researchers at Ohio State University say that right-left asymmetries in body features can be a marker for aggressive tendencies. Studying fingers, ears, feet, etc. in 100 college students, they calculated an overall index of asymmetry. Students then endured a series of frustrating phone encounters. The most asymmetri- cal proved to be the most easily pro- voked. What's the connection? Writing in the July- August American Journal of Human Biology, the authors cite studies showing that stresses such as illness, alcohol use, or smoking during pregnancy can cause asymmetrical fe- tal development. That affects the cen- tral nervous system, which governs im- pulse control and aggression. OCTOBER 2004"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"MUFON Forum Director's Message I am a MUFON member and, by vir- tue of my BS in Earth Science, MS in Geology, and 27 years of professional experience, am a MUFON Research Specialist in Geology/Astronomy. As such, I have a knowledge of most geologic and meteorological phenom- enon, and since I worked in Alaska for Shell Oil Co. for years, I am somewhat familiar with Arctic phenomena. Because of these facts, I was imme- diately aroused when I recently read a passage in a book, In the Land of White Death, by Valerian Albanov, a graduate of the Russian Naval College of St. Pe- tersburg and an officer (navigator). This is a factual account of Albanov's 1912 voyage to the Arctic on the vessel Saint Anna, their entrapment for two years in Arctic ice flows, and his 1914 200-mile sled and kayak journey back to civilization. The passage of interest is on Page 204 of my Modern Library Exploration Series, paperback edition, reprinted in 2001 from Albanov's original published in Russian in 1917. It was during the constant dark of the . Arctic winter of 1913, and they were ice- bound north of the Franz Josef Islands in the far north. The passage says, \"On November 8, an eerie event occurs, or seems to oc- cur. At five o'clock at night we saw some kind of red star that was moving to the northeast. At first we thought that someone was approaching, everyone ran out on deck, but no one was there.\" What does that sound like to you?? Remember, it was 1914, so it was not an airplane (not that far north of Russia headed northeast), and I would have to assume that sailors who had been at this location in the ice for two winters would be very familiar with meteors, fireballs, aurora and other normal atmospheric events. Again, I spent several years in Alaska with Shell, and did quite a lot of skywatching and saw auroras and many other atmospheric displays, but not one ; that I would describe as a \"moving red star.\" I have never read of this event in any of the UFO literature. -Richard Sumner r-sumner@sbcglobal.net OCTOBER 2004 (Continued from page 2) web site.

Documentary film tells story of alleged UFO crash at Aztec As research continues into the infa- mous, yet unproven, Aztec UFO crash of 1948, a Canadian film company has released the first full-length documen- tary about the event. The Aztec Public Library, sponsor of the annual Aztec UFO Symposium, re- cently previewed this video \"which el- evates die story to a national level of dis- cussion,\" according to Leanne Hathcock, librarian and founder of the symposium. It was her research, along with the help of North Carolina resident Scott Ramsey, that led to a renaissance of in- terest in the purported crash in March, 1948, in Hart Canyon north of Aztec. Ramsey has completed countless hours of research, and has successfully declassified material pertinent to the in- cident. \"We're working very hard in trying to iden- tify two law enforcement officers at the scene, and at the same time trying to be respectful to the families,\" Ramsey said. (See article by Ramsey in the August, 2004, MUFON UFO Journal.) The film begins with a view of San Juan County's high desert landscape, with film producer Paul Kimball telling the story of Aztec. It.was a quiet evening north of the county seat when an oil well fire broke out on a mesa above Hart Canyon. The fire reportedly led people to a crashed UFO containing charred bodies. ~1"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"Nebraska mutilation reported New radio device - • .  • -• - ' '' •  • •  . ••« ••• ia • • - m m i Larry Jurjens was checking his herd of about 100 cattle near Farnam, NE, on Aug. 19, 2004, when he found a dead 11-year-old Black Angus. He said the cow's left eyeball and udders had been removed, and there was a large exci- sion in the rectal region. None of the internal organs were re- moved, and he said the cuts appeared to have been made with surgical precision. The tongue had also been removed with the incision made far back into the throat. Jurjens said two puncture marks were on the cow, each about 1/8 of an inch in diameter. He said no blood was found on or near the cow. Jurjens, who has been a rancher in Farnam, NE, for more than 35 years, said he has never seen anything like it be- fore. He estimates that the cow had been dead for two days before it was discov- ered, and the estimated time of death cor- responds with unidentified noises heard in the area. On the night of Aug. 17, 2004, Jurjens's wife, Joanne, heard what sounded like a large, low-flying aircraft going over the house. The low rumbling noise was heard by several other witnesses as far away as Gothenburg (population 3,679),\" 16 miles (27 kilometers) north of Farnam. Wit- nesses said the noise persisted for a minute to five minutes in some areas. The mutilation is being investigated by Linda Moulton Howe. nrlfl The Los Angeles Sheriff's-Depart- ment has ordered a high-energy radio wave device that can be used by troop- ers to scramble automotive brains and disable most cars, thus shortening chases. Developed by Eureka Aerospace, the device will scramble the computer chips that control fuel injection, engine firing, and other functions at a range of 160 feet. The disabling device, which can project from an antenna mounted on the roof of police cruisers, can either per- manently fry the target car's components or temporarily disable them. The zapper is scheduled to go into production after a prototype is completed at the end of this year. STATEMENT OF OWNERSHIP, MAMACEMENT AND aRCUUTION LPubBcatkm Title: MUFON UFO Journal 7.

Prehistoric sea once a large part of Mars landscape •An ancient sea larger than the com- bined Great Lakes of the USA and Canada lively-filled the basin on Mars where NASA's Opportunity rover now roams, say scientists. On Sept. 9 in the journal Nature, a University of Colorado team reports that salt outcrops like those measured by Op- portunity, evidence of an ancient sea, ap- pear from space to cover about 127,000 square miles ofMartian-soil. -The climate on Mars several billion years-ago must have been much wetter than today, the scientists conclude. 24 Wai November 2004 Bright Planets (Evening Sky): Saturn (magnitude 0.1), in Gemini, continues as the only bright planet vis- ible in the autumn evening sky. Begin- ning retrograde (westward) motion on the 8th, the ringed world rises in the ENE about 8:30 PM in midmonth. It advances across the southern sky during the night. Bright Planets (Morning Sky): Venus (-4.0) rises in the E shortly before 4 AM (midmonth). The radiant planet is very near Jupiter on Nov. 4 and 5. It is near the lunar crescent on the 10th. In fact, there is a neat vertical line-up of celestial objects at twilight on the latter morning. From the top down, they are Jupiter, Venus, the crescent Moon, and Mars. Mars (1.7), in Virgo, rises about 4:45 AM in the ESE. The ruddy planet can be glimpsed near the thin lunar crescent at dawn on Nov. 11. See Venus. Jupiter (-1.8), in Virgo, rises in the ESE about 3 AM and makes a stunning pair with nearby Venus. The giant world hovers near the crescent Moon on the 9th. See Venus. Saturn moves, to a point high in the SW at dawn. Moon Phases: Last quarter—November 5 New moon—November 12 First quarter—November 19 Full moon—November 26; The Stars: At 9 PM in mid-November the Sum- mer Triangle is poised above the west- ern horizon; the Great Square of Pe- gasus occupies center stage in the S; and conspicuously bright Orion, the winter sky symbol, emerges in the E. Mean- while the Big Dipper rests on the north- ern horizon at the nadir of its circumpo- lar orbit from midnorthern.latitudes. Across the celestial north pole from the Big Dipper is the crooked \"M\" of. Cassiopeia the Queen. Like the dipper, Cassiopeia never sets from northerly lati- tudes. MUFON UFO Journal Between the Queen and fishhook- shaped Perseus to the E, look for a pair of fuzzy spots-the Double Cluster of Per- seus. View the twin star clusters with binoculars or a telescope. Another UFO incident reported in Mersin, Turkey Mersin Deputy Chief of Police Suleyman Ekizer, announced that police officers recorded another luminous \"UFO\" over ATAS Refinery. Ekizer explained that an unidentified object in the sky over ATAS refinery was reported July 30 at about 3:30 AM. He also stated that Investigation and Identification teams went to the place in question and recorded the unidentified flying object on video camera. On July 20, between 4 AM and 5:20 AM the police had captured a luminous unidentified flying object over Free Zone Motorway Bridge, and the footage had been sent to the Turkey Scientific and Technologic Research Association and Sirius UFO Space Sciences Research Centre. The Centre had concluded that the .object in that footage was a flying saucer. OCTOBER 2004"}]
