BLT Research Team Inc. (www.bltresearch.com) I n a new X-ray diffraction examina- tion of clay minerals in crop circle soils, recently posted on the BLT Research Team Inc. web-site, scientists have not only ob- tained a statisti- cally significant change in the primary indica- tor of crystalline structure (the Rubier Index) in specific clay minerals in crop circle soils, but have also been able to demonstrate a very strong positive cor- relation between these results and node- length increase in the plants inside the formation. A sharpening of the mica 001 peak [a decrease in the Kubler Index (KI) value, indicative of growth of the illite/mica crys- tals] in soils inside the formation (as com- pared to the control soils outside the for- mation) was found to be statistically sig- nificant at the 95% level of confidence. Additionally, this sharpening of the mica 001 peak correlated with apical node- length increase found in the plants at the same sampling locations at a greater than 99% level of confidence, thus strongly supporting W.C. Levengood's earlier published crop circle plant research which has maintained that apical node- length increase is a primary characteris- tic of \"genuine\" crop formations (crop formations which are not mechanically flattened). Further, this subtle, but statistically significant, decrease in the Kubler Index of the mica 001 peak cannot be attributed to either interstitial water loss (there was no consistent change in the KIs of the glycolated samples), nor_to mechanical flattening of the crop circle, since such changes in KI are known to be caused by \"geologic\" pressure (the weight of thou- sands of tons of overlying rock pressing down on sediments, in conjunction with the heat from the earth's core....over thou- May 2004 This formation in a thistle-infested barley field in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, has provided a breakthrough in crop circle research. sands of years). The change in KI documented in this study is normally seen only in sedimen- tary rock, and has never been documented before in surface soils (as was the case here). In the absence of geologic pressure, temperatures of at least 600-800°C over several hours of exposure would have been required to alter the KIs, according to renowned clay-minerologist Dr. Rob- ert C. Reynolds, Jr., past head of the De- partment of Earth Sciences at Dartmouth College and now Emeritus, who con- sulted with BLT Inc. on this study. Obviously, temperature in this range for this period of time would have incin- erated any plant material present, as well as causing other measurable soil and plant effects, which were not found. Because there is currently no energy known to science which can selectively affect soils to one degree and plants at the same sampling locations to another (as is demonstrated here), we may have evidence of a new-and as yet unknown- energy source at work. While it does appear that heat may be involved, more research is needed to de- termine its precise nature. Study background In 1996 local geologist Diane Conrad MUFON UFO Journal Study objectives • To determine through x-ray dif- fraction examination (XRD) and mea- surement of the consequent Kubler Index (KI) whether changes in crys- talline structure exist in specific clay minerals (illite/smectites) in surface soils inside crop circles, as compared to control soils from outside the flat- tened-crop perimeters; • To determine the statistical sig- nificance of the KI data; • To determine whether changes in crystallinity of the illite/smectites in crop circle soils (as demonstrated by changes in the KI) are correlated with apical node-length changes in crop circle plants sampled at the same sampling locations as the soils; • To determine if the XRD/KI re- sults rule out direct mechanical flat- tening of the crop circle plants; • To determine if the XRD/KI re- sults offer support for the hypoth- esis that an atmospheric plasma vor- tex system, emitting microwave radia- tion, is involved as a causative agent in the crop-circle formation process. Page 3"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"visited a crop circle which had occurred near her home in Logan, UT. The forma- tion, the first one reported in the general area, caused quite a stir locally and re- sulted in a local radio interview with me about the BLT Research Team's previous crop circle research and results. In that interview, Michigan scientist W.C. Levengood's hypothesis that some sort of atmospheric plasma system might be involved was discussed at length-in particular the fact that plants and soils at crop circle sites had been shown by Levengood et al to exhibit abnormalities consistent with their exposure to brief bursts of intense heat. Also pointed out was the fact that plasmas are known to emit microwaves when they spiral, and thus could be a possible source of this heat. Having written her Master's Thesis on heat effects on clay minerals, Ms. Conrad reasoned that certain expandable clays in the soils at crop circle sites might provide additional evidence of this heat- ing action. If the soils, and these expandable clay minerals (illites/smectites), had been ex- posed to unusual heating, it was possible that a change in the degree of crystallin- ity might have occurred. Since Ms. Conrad was familiar with both the particular measure of crystallin- iry (the Kubler Index) and the X-ray dif- fraction (XRD) methodology utilized to obtain this information, she decided to carry out preliminary testing on the 1996 Logan, UT, crop circle soils. Ms. Conrad's results from this prelimi- nary XRD investigation were intriguing. The soil sample from within the crop circle showed a pronounced decrease in the Kubler Index of the illite peak, as com- pared to the control (S=0.11; C=0.25), in- dicating increased crystallinity in the circle sample. Ms. Conrad then took the three re- maining aliquots of the control sample and heated the first in a conventional oven for ten minutes at 93°C, and the sec- ond for ten minutes at 287°C; the third was microwaved for two minutes to de- termine the effects of energy of different wavelengths on the crystal structure. In these three heated control samples the Kubler Index consistently decreased (from 1.0 to 0.07), with the microwaved aliquot producing a Kubler Index most similar to that of the circle sample. It must be kept in mind that this in- crease in degree of crystallization (greater ordering of the atoms) in clay minerals has never been documented in surface soils before. Such changes are typically seen in sedimentary rock which has been Judy Arndt, who with husband Mike sampled the formation, cre- ated this computer diagram to show the three layers of the crop, indicating the directions in which the crop was laid. This pattern was the same in all seven circles. It appears that there were at least three, types of action that affected the plants: (1) A concentric ring defines the edge of each circle. The width of the ring in the large circle is about 18 inches, and in the small- est circles about six inches.   . (2) Most of the remaining plants within the rings were flattened in a radial lay, very straight and close to the soil. These plants lay on top of those in the concentric rings. The field is heavily infested with Canada thistle, and most of the thistle in the formation was laid hard to the ground along with the barley. (3) Some plants-perhaps 10 to 25 percent of the barley, but less that 1 percent of the thistle-were left semi-standing, with many nodes severely kinked. Nodes are bent at angles from 40 to 120 degrees. The standing thistle plants were obviously deformed. Some wild oats in the field were also left semi-standing, with many ex- pulsion cavities in the nodes of the wild oats. In the geometric center of Circle \"A \" was a triangular crack, filled with loose, finely-crumbled soil. A barley plant had fallen (or been sucked?) into this hole, seed head down, buried to a depth of at least 12 inches. When the barley head was pulled from the hole, its long'beards were essentially intact.

If such a change were to be demon- strated (with statistical significance) in surface soils in an in-depth study at crop circle sites, it would certainly inspire in- creased academic interest in the causative mechanism behind the crop circle phe- nomenon. I wanted to do such a study, and subsequently sought the necessary funding. In 1999, New York philanthro- pist Laurance S. Rockefeller provided BLT Inc. with the funds needed to implement this in-depth XRD examination of expand- able clay minerals (illites/smectites) in crop circle soils. Study case selection A number of crop circles in several countries were considered as potential candidates for this study, and there were multiple factors which guided the final choice. BLT relied heavily on the research published by W.C. Levengood et al. (1994; 1995; 1999) over the years to help choose a productive study case, and paid spe- cific attention to BLT Lab Report #79, which states that both multiple expulsion cavities and statistically significant api- cal node-length increases were docu- mented in the plants at the Logan, UT, crop formation. Additionally, it was noted that the crop-lay in the upper-most plants in both circles in the Logan formation had been more radial than spiral (radial crop-lays are less common than spiral lays) and quite chaotic in overall appearance. Four crop circles (one in Holland, one in the U.S., and two in Canada) were evaluated preliminarily as candidates for the study. All of these cases provided Field sampling diagram, Circle C, and some controls. Relevant findings included: (1) expulsion cavities (holes blown out at the plant stem nodes) were found in 68% of the 71 plant sample sets (approximately 710 plants) taken inside the three sampled circles, and no expulsion cavities were found in the 23 con- trol plant sets examined (approximtely 230 plants; (2) node expansion levels in all of the 71 plant sample sets taken inside the formation were signifi- cantly higher than the overall con- trol level; (3) an eight-day germination test disclosed no significant growth dif- ferences between the formation and control seedlings, probably due to the fact that the plants were at or vety near han>est maturity; and (4) a minimal increase in volume of magnetic particles was found in the formation soils. statistically significant apical node-length increases in the plants, as well as the pres- ence of expulsion cavities, and two had the radial lay in evidence. Preliminary XRD examination of the soils in all but the Hol- land case also suggested increases in the crystalline structure of the illite/smectites in the soils. In the Holland event a reliable eyewit- ness existed to the circle forming under- neath a disc-shaped light which had hovered over the field, but the soils from this field were extremely rich, containing very little clay, and it became apparent that the extraction of the clays in prepa- ration for X-ray diffraction was not cost- effective for this study. The U.S. case not only had node- length increases and expulsion cavities present, it also was one of the first cases where the massively twisted and spiraled stem at the base of the seed-head was observed. However, the field-team in this in- stance had misunderstood the sampling protocol, and there were not enough con- trols available. And in one of the two Canadian May 2004 MUFON UFO Journal PageS"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"cases, the fanner had mowed quite a bit of the field surrounding the formation prior to the BLT field-team's sampling, thus making it impossible to obtain both plant and soil samples at all the required locations. The fourth case, a seven-circle forma- tion (overall length 191 ft.) in barley at Edmonton, Alberta, Canada in Septem- ber, 1999, was the only case of the four which could be examined within our bud- get and which also met all of the basic criteria, and so it was chosen for the in- depth XRD study. Unknown to us at the time, this Edmonton formation would turn out to be one of the most interesting crop circles we have studied so far. The apical node elongation was so extreme at Edmonton that it was clearly visible in the field (and subsequently confirmed to be statistically significant by Levengood), and the sampling-team found massive numbers of expulsion cavi- ties all the way down the barley stems, in some instances also involving the apical node. The lay of the crop in all seven circles was complex, with an uppermost layer chaotically laid in varying directions, a radially-laid layer beneath that, with an underlying, narrow, counter-clockwise ring of flattened crop around the perim- eter of each of the seven circles. This formation was found by the farmer, who subsequently reported that he had observed multiple circles the pre- vious year in an adjacent field at harvest that were not visible from the nearest roads (which he had thought might be caused by deer bedding down). The fact that the field was infested with Canadian thistle, which made it al- most impossible to walk in the area with- out high protective boots, tended to fur- ther rule out the possibility that this for- mation had been mechanically produced. Finally, fieldworkers Mike and Judy Arndt carried out a thorough, comprehen- sive sampling and precise documentation of the field situation, in spite of the Cana- dian thistle, thus making this Edmonton case overall the best candidate. For those knowledgeable about the crop circle phenomenon it is interesting to note that, during the sampling work, cell-phone failure inside the circles was observed by. the Arndts. In addition, unusual aerial light phe- nomena were reported by the farmer and his wife and at least one other unrelated individual during the time-period when this formation was thought to have oc- curred. Sampling procedure Plant samples, consisting of 15-20 plants/sample, cut off at just above the soil level, were taken along multiple di- ameters at precise inter- vals (which varied, de- pending upon overall circle size) in three of the seven circles that made up the Edmonton crop formation. In some samples the number of plants/ sample varies because of the heavy infestation of thistle, which made it impossible in every sam- pling location to obtain 15-20 plants ad- jacent to each other. Magnetic North was determined by the field-team, and in two of the sampled circles this diameter was sampled. Previous plant research had indicated that in crop formations comprised of mul- tiple-sized circles the most significant plant changes often occur in the smaller- diameter circles. The field-team was un- able to complete the full sampling of the smaller circle in this case, but in spite of this the plant data revealed interesting results. Plant controls, also consisting of 15- 20 plants/sample cut off at the base, were taken along four different control lines beginning at 75 ft. away from the flat- tened edges of various sections of the formation and continuing to between 175 ft. and 265 ft. away from the flattened edges, at 25 ft. intervals. Soil samples and controls, consisting of approximately 1/2 cup of surface soil at each location (down to a depth not ex- ceeding 1/2 inch), were taken immediately around each plant sampling location and then placed in plastic bags and labeled. The fieldwork took three days to com- plete (Sept. 30, Oct. 1 & 2, 1999), after which the plant samples were allowed to dry for an additional three weeks, prior to shipping to Michigan for the initial plant and soil analyses. Plant results Twenty-three control sets (approx. 230 plants) and seventy-one sample sets (approx. 710 plants) were examined by Michigan biophysicist W.C. Levengood. Two of the most reliable indicators (node- length increase and the presence of ex- pulsion cavaties) that an unusual energy system had impacted the plants inside the flattened circles were found. [Both of these abnormalites are thought to be caused by a rapid, intense exposure of the plants to heat (micro- waves?) which turns the internal stem Dr. Sampath S. lyengar moisture to steam. Depending on (a) the elasticity of the plant fibers (younger tis- sues are more elastic), (b) the amount of moisture inside the plant stems, and (c) the intensity and/or duration of the heat- ing agency itself, the steam either stretches the apical node of the plant and/or bursts holes through the lower nodes as it escapes. [See published pa- pers, 1994; 1995; 1999.] Expulsion cavities . (holes blown out at the plant stem nodes) were found in 68% of the 71 plant sample sets; none were found in the 23 control sets. These expulsion cavities were found not only in the apical node (1st node be- neath the seed-head) and in the penultimate node (2nd node beneath the seed-head), but also in the third node beneath the seed-head-with multiple ex- pulsion cavities observed in many of the plant stems, the first time that this had been documented in the laboratory. Apical node-elongation levels in all of the 71 plant sample sets were significantly higher (p <0.01) than the overall control level. All three sampled circles disclosed very significant node-length increases, with the plants from the smallest circle showing the greatest node-elongation (+109%). [Five tables containing the complete plant data obtained by W.C. Levengood are in the full BLT report, but are not in- cluded in this summary article; see www.bltresearch.com, \"Clay Mineral XRD Study.\"] X-ray diffraction analysis Dr. Sampath S. lyengar, a geochemist/ minerologist and X-ray diffraction and materials science specialist, carried out the clay mineral extractions and X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis at his analyti- cal materials laboratory (Technology of Materials) in San Diego, CA (now located inWildomar.CA). Dr. lyengar was recommended by a colleague because of his acknowedged expertise in the XRD technique; it was a further bonus that he was also totally unacquainted with the crop circle phe- nomenon or any of the controversy sur- rounding it, thus further protecting this analysis from any experimenter bias. XRD is regularly used to evaluate de- gree of crystallinity in specific clay min- erals. As x-rays are refracted from the sample mounts printed graphs are pro- duced with multiple peaks which repre- Page6 MUFON UFO Journal May 2004"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"Dr. Ravi Raghavan sent specific clay minerals-it is the width of these peaks, at half-height, which pro- duces the value known as the Kubler In- dex (KI), a known indicator of degree of crystallinity in the sample. As the width -of the peak narrows, the KI numerical value decreases. Decreases in KI indicate increased crystallinity, and, when this change is subtle, large number of samples are re- quired to prove that the change is statis- tically significant— and therefore mean- ingful. Illite/smectites, and specifically the mica 001 peaks, were examined because they are the most expandable of clay minerals and therefore thought to be the most likely to provide evidence of having been exposed to heat. [Dr. lyengar's full report is in the com- plete BUT report, but is not included in this summary article.]. Statistical analysis Upon completion of the XRD work, the Kubler Index (KI) data were submitted to Ohio statistician Dr. Ravi Raghavan for analysis. Dr. Raghavan's first objective was to establish whether there were differences in the KI values between the Edmonton cropcircle soil samples and controls, and, if there were, to determine whether these differences were statistically significant. As stated at the beginning of this ar- ticle, a sharpening of the mica 001 peak (a decrease in the KI, indicating growth of the illite/mica crystals) was found in the crop circle soils, as compared with the control soils. Further, this increase was found to be statistically significant at the 95% level of confidence. Dr. Raghavan was then sent Levengood's node-length data and asked whether a correlation existed between the plant node-length data (NL) and the Kubler Index (KI) data obtained from the soils at the same sampling locations. The regression analysis reveals a cor- relation between decreases in KI and in- creases inNL, at the 99.2% level of confi- dence. In other words, at almost all sampling locations where there was node-length increase in the plants there was ALSO increase in the degree of crystallization of the clay minerals in the soils. [Dr. Raghavan's statistical report is in the full BLT report, but is not included in this summary article.] Mineralogical review We were extremely fortunate to be able to consult with Dartmouth College geolo- gist/minerologist Robert C.Reynolds, Jr., described by his colleagues as \"a bril- liant scientist and without any exaggera- tion ... the best known expert in the world of X-ray diffraction analy- sis of finely-dispersed layer compounds, and first of all, of clay minerals\" (D.M. Moore, \"Presenta- tion of the Roebling Medal of the Mineralogical Soci- ety of America for 2000 to Robert Coltart Reynolds, Jr., Am. Mineralogist 86:94345,2001). Currently Frederick Hall Professor of Geology and Mineralogy, Emeritus, Dr. Reynolds examined the BLT work and stated that he was \"...convinced that the sample preparation methods and the X-ray analytical procedures used were consistent with sound, standard methods of analysis. In short, the data have been obtained by competent per- sonnel using current equipment.\" Reynolds, however, wondered whether the observed sharpening of the mica 001 peak might be caused by the dehydration of inter-stratified smectite layers in the crystals, and asked that ad- ditional statistical work be carried out to evaluate this possibility. A paired t-test was then conducted, comparing the KIs in both the RT and glycolated conditions, but no significant difference was found with, or without, glycolation, again at the 95% level of con- fidence. This was true for each of the sampled circles individually and all of the sampled circles combined. Following this additional statistical inquiry into the possiblity that loss of interstitial water might account for the subtle sharpening of the mica 001 peak, Reynolds concluded: \"The possibility of smectite dehydration seems ruled out by the fact that the data show no systematic increase in peak breadth upon ethylene glycol solvation of the samples.\" Because Diane Conrad's preliminary work on the Logan, UT, formation in- cluded exposure of control aliquots of soil to microwave radiation (which had pro- duced results which Ms. Conrad thought were most similar to the KIs she obtained from the formation samples), Dr. Reynolds asked that we submit a few of the Edmonton soil samples to microwave ex- posure also. Eight soils controls were placed in a commercial microwave oven and exposed for one minute, ten minutes, and 60 min- utes to see if changes in KI of these microwaved controls would replicate the KIs obtained in the formation samples. There was, however, no consistent re- sponse in KI among the microwaved con- trols, thus suggesting that microwave radiation was not the cause of the KI change observed in the crop circle samples. A paper which is intended for submis- sion to a scientific journal was nearly com- pleted a year ago, but Dr. Reynolds' ill health prevented completion of this pa- per until now. We expect to submit the paper for publication shortly, and, once published, this paper will also be posted- on the BLT web-site. The complete study report can be found @ www.bltresearch.com, \"Clay Mineral XRD Study.\" © 2002 BLT Research Team Inc. Results 1. A sharpening of the mica 001 peak (indicative of growth of the il- lite/mica crystals) was observed in the crop circle soil samples, as com- pared with their controls; 2. This increase was found to be statistically significant at the 95% level of confidence; 3. A correlation was found be- tween this sharpening of the mica 001 peak (KI) and the increases in plant stem node-length (NL), a corre- lation which is statistically signifi- cant at a greater than 99% level of confidence; 4. The changes in the mica 001 peak cannot be attributed to manual flattening of the crop circle, as tem- peratures of 600-800 degress C (over several hours) are required in the laboratory to produce increased crys- tal growth; 5. Because the temperatures re- quired (600-800 degrees C) to cause mica crystal growth would have in- cinerated any plant material present at the site (as well as causing other soil effects), and because we know of no energy which can selectively affect soils to one degree and plants to another (as documented here), we may be observing a new or as yet undiscovered energy at work. It does appear that heat is in- volved, but more research is needed to determine its precise nature. May 2004 MUFON UFO Journal Page?"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"Ours, alien, or both? Triangular craft: what are they? Part II Rich Dolan By Richard Dolan (Continued from April issue) A t the NUFORC, you can read /\\ about 25 reasonably detailed ./ \\J-eports of triangular UFOs that were seen from 1967 through 1973, and there are several that are even earlier. This must be the tip of the iceberg: the first of these accounts was posted only in 1998; when the world wide'web finally became a convenient tool for these people. We will never know how many 1960s witnesses of triangular craft died before they had the opportunity to post their stories, but I'm sure there were a few. Indeed, British researcher Victor Kean, who started Project Triangle on the world wide web, tracked many triangle reports in Britain that took place in the 1990s, but pointed out that his first reliable triangle report dates from Sept. 8,1960. This was a \"triangular-shaped craft with three white apex lights and a red light underneath,\" seen in Tyneside, Brit- ain, and two other locations that evening, all within a 10-mile radius and within 75 minutes of each other. Did someone in- vent flying triangles in the 1950s? 7 If one feels that reports from that long ago are inherently unreliable and need to be discarded, what does one make of the large number of triangle reports from be- tween 1973 and the early 1980s? That is, prior to the Hudson Valley wave? A serious problem Reports that go so far back pose a se- rious problem of explanation. There are several factors to consider. First is tech- nology. Granted that the black world of the military has always been substan- tially ahead of most civilian technology, still we can do a reality check by observ- ing the development of leading edge air- craft during those years. For example, the first flight of the F-15 Eagle took place in July 1972. It was the first USAF fighter to have a thrust to weight ratio greater than 1:1, meaning it could accelerate going straight up. . • The first F-16 prototype\" flew at Edwards AFB in January 1974. The Rockwell B-1 bomber first flew in Decem- ber 1974. The Apache helicopter proto- type first flew in September 1975. These machines are all impressive, but none is anything like the reported triangles. It is also important to realize that it was only by the mid-1970s that \"fly-by-wire\" (e.g. very advanced computer technol- ogy enabling an aircraft to make many adjustments per second) was becoming practical enough to allow for unconven- tional planforms such as the flying whig. Previously, the flying wing design (and by extension the triangle) had been in- herently unstable. Other problems arise when we look at the history of American defense spend- ing. For instance, the USAF budget in 1980 was about $39 billion. Starting in 1981, with the advent of the Reagan presi- dency, it began a dramatic rise, peaking in 1985 at $99.4 billion. This is an extraordinary development, and while we can acknowledge that there was always a supply of secret money for special projects, we can also recognize that there was much more of it starting in the early 1980s. Presumably this translated into greater operational possibilities for leading edge technology. In other words, while it would still have been possible to fund expensive, secret, and exotic aircraft prior to 1980, it would have been easier to do this after 1980. 8 Thus, when you examine the history of triangle sightings, track what is known of the development of advanced aircraft, and study the trends in defense spend- ing, it becomes difficult to credit many of these earlier reports as secret technology. Difficult, but'not perhaps impossible. After all, how many years ahead of our most advanced open and public technol- ogy are these triangles? It's hard to be About the Author Richard Dolan studied at Oxford University, and did graduate work at the University of Rochester. While working as a self-employed business writer he became interested in \"the UFO problem.\" Throughout 1995,1996, and 1997, he spent most of his spare time con- ducting \"a fairly systematic biblio- graphic search,\" hunting down the many out-of-print books and UFO documents released over the years through the Freedom of Information Act. \"Once I began to delve,\" he says, \"I found the amount of information nearly overwhelming. I was methodi- cal, however, and eventually pre- pared a detailed chronology of rel- evant events, and realized it was more than enough for a useful text on the subject. So I set out to write it.\" The result was his book, UFOs and the National Security State, available at keyholepublishing.com. Among Dolan's many speaking engagements was an appearance at the 2002 MUFON International Sym- posium. certain, but it doesn't seem to be a stretch to anticipate similar capabilities in the public realm within the next twenty years. Political Problems But to acknowledge that some group in the secret caverns of the military-in- dustrial complex made this type of break- through opens up a new series of ques- tions. Let us return to the Belgian case, for instance. Belgian Air Force Colonel De Brouwer speculated that if these objects were B-2 or F^ 117 stealth aircraft (the only known American aircraft that might re- motely fit the description), then the USAF had made no requests for this type of mission, as it would be required to do.-He Page8 MUFON UFO Journal May 2004"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"also added.the obvious fact that the tri- angles did not \"in any way\" match the characteristics of either U.S. aircraft. Still, the Belgian government asked the U.S. government whether or not, in ef- fect, these triangles were American. The U.S. Air Force informed the Belgian Air Force and Ministry of .Defense that \"no USAF stealth aircraft were operating\" during the period in question. Now, this could be seen as merely a carefully worded statement. No \"stealth\" aircraft-might this allow the overflight of an aircraft that is not, technically speak- ing, stealth? After all, the triangle over Belgium was tracked at least some of the time on radar. As far as this statement is concerned, it could simply mean that a non-stealth but highly advanced U.S. aircraft was respon- sible. 9 If so, then we have a disturbing con- clusion regarding how the U.S. Air Force treats its NATO allies. With the advent of Gulf War II, this may not surprise too many people. But in 1990, there was still a Soviet Union, and the vestige of a cold war. At the least, it seems neither polite nor intelligent to treat your NATO allies in such a manner. Although it strains credulity to see this as American technology, the entire UFO phenomenon strains credulity. That is until you go through report after impos- sible report, recognizing that the impos- sible is here and living quite well in this demented world of ours, thank you very much.  . BBDs the answer? For now, that will have to do regard- ing the chronological problems posed by the triangles. There are still a few possi- bilities to consider. The National Institute for Discovery Science (NIDS), based in Las Vegas, NV, has recently been looking into the matter of what it has termed Big Black Deltas (BBDs). These are essentially the large triangles. 10 In 2002 an aircraft researcher submit- ted a paper to NIDS on the condition that it be published anonymously (\"Big Black Deltas (BBDs): DoD, Not ET\"). He argued that these objects are lighter-than-air (LTA) craft, or rigid dirigibles, most likely powered by \"electrokinetic\" drive, oper- ated by the U.S. military. In other words^ U.S. Defense Depart- ment airships that serve as large trans- port vessels, able to carry huge payloads at high or low altitudes, at speeds several times faster than surface ships. The au- thor of the paper theorized that they have existed since the early to mid-1980s. He theorized that these objects are Police Report Sketch, January 2000, Officer Martin; Shiloh, IL, Po- lice Department quiet because LTA vehicles can make use of the \"unconventional\" electrokinetic system. They would need no propellers or jets, instead using aerostatic, lift gas, like a balloon. All you might hear is a slight humming from high voltage control equip- ment, and an occasional coronal dis- charge in the older BBDs. Acceleration explained? The NIDS author also discussed why the BBDs can accelerate so quickly. I have to confess that my science breaks down at this point, but the explanation is not especially detailed, either. The author argued that the LTA would not require a power supply, as its energy source could be fed remotely by a \"ground based power system sending power to the electrokinetic platform by either a tether wire or by microwave link.\" The maximum transmission distance would be about 62 miles. The thrust to mass ratio of such a craft would be far superior to that of a jet fighter, \"between 1.7 to 1 up to 3 to 1 if lightly loaded,\" which would enable it to accelerate very quickly, including up. The author discussed other features of the BBDs, such as the ability to turn without banking or its occasionally in- tense lights. He concluded that, \"with a number of military mission profiles for such a craft and the technologies to build it having been well developed for nearly a century, would any defense department NOT build it?\" This hypothesis seems primarily de- signed to address the Millstadt, IL, sight- ing of early 2000. As a result, We are obliged to ask, if this object was ours, where was the microwave transmitter? This object surely was not tethered, and its acceleration wasn't just high, it was very, very high. Not everyone believes the power source concept described in this anony- mous paper is valid. One of my correspon- dents pointed out to me that while beamed microwave power has been done, it re- quires a line of sight and what is called rectenna, an array of dipoles which is dangerous to anything that gets in its path, such as birds. I am not aware, for instance, of reports of dead birds accompanying sightings of BBDs. Finally, it doesn't help that this paper is from an anonymous source. While the people at NIDS know who this author is, it would be nice if the rest of us get the opportunity to learn this person's identity and credentials (although one writer has assured me privately that the author possesses substantial qualifica- tions). NIDS has also plotted several hundred sightings of the BBDs (all from the 1990s) on a map of the United States, trying to see a pattern. In addition to using its own substantial database, NIDS obtained two other substantial sources of data, from MUFON and UFO researcher Larry Hatch. NIDS suggested that many of the BED sightings occurred along corridors be- tween bases of the U.S. Air Mobility Command (AMC) and Air Force Materiel Command (AFMC). These two com- mands control the logistics of American troop and equipment deployment. NIDS hypothesized, therefore, that the Air Force is flying these objects between AFMC and AMC bases.\" Another explanation? This may be just as NIDS suggests, but although it says the similarities among the various databases are \"striking,\" I found the experience of reading these maps a little like deciphering a Rorschach test. There does seem to be a concentra- tion of sightings along such \"corridors,\" but I can't help wondering if there is an- other explanation here, and that this is a May 2004 MUFON UFO Journal Page 9"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"case where one could find all sorts of patterns to fit other hypotheses. NIDS did fine work, and worded its conclusions carefully. It is to be com- mended for this. But it must be noted that its study (a) includes only reports from the 1990s (b) includes only reports of the large triangles, and (c) is restricted geo- graphically to the United States. There are such things as rigid diri- gibles. An inventor name Michael K. Walden demonstrated a fully solar-pow- ered, remotely-controlled LTA vehicle to the U.S. Department of Defense and De- partment of Energy at Nellis AFB in 1977. They seemed to have been rather excited by this, but never picked up the con- tract. 12 The problem of geography I have already said that the long his- tory of triangle reports poses serious prob- lems of explanation, but so does the ge- ography. Researchers commonly write as though the triangles are a North Ameri- can and Western European phenomenon. This seems to be true in the main, but I suspect it is mainly due to more active reporting in those areas. In any case, it is not entirely true. Russia, for example, has had many triangle reports, several that occurred during the Belgian flap. An especially interesting one occurred near Moscow on March 12,1990. Several groups of UFOs were seen, some of which were spheres and discs, and some of which appeared to be huge triangular- shaped craft. Many local people spent the night on their rooftops watching these silent ob- jects dart through the sky. In fact, during the spring of 1990, it appears that Russia had more-and more spectacular-UFO cases than did Belgium. The CIA retained several accounts of this wave from the Soviet-Russian media, although CIA re- ports themselves, assuming they exist, have yet to be released. Thus, while the NIDS explanation of Big Black Deltas may shed some light, the hypothesis is far from proved, and at best is only a partial solution to the mys- tery of the triangles. Are we to assume that some covert American group was fly- ing triangles (along with other UFOs) throughout Russia during the decline phase of the Soviet Union? A Shadow Government? There is perhaps one last terrestrial explanation, but it isn't a pretty one. Could there be an ultra-black group be- hind the triangles, one that is so far re- moved from ordinary channels that the American military establishment has lost control of it? Artist's sketch of UFO seen over California. Could such a secret group exist? Our national security apparatus has many lay- ers of classification (including above top secret) and extreme compartmentalization. There is no question that the American military possesses unacknowledged Special Access Programs (SAP) funded by countless billions of secret dollars. Congress provides no effective over- sight of these programs, judging by the history of the few secret programs of which we know. A great deal can get swal- lowed up by our National Security State, and we must recognize the possibility that the flying triangles are one of those things. It is at this point that an analysis of the flying triangles merges with the UFO phenomenon itself. In the first place, the flight capabilities of the triangles appear to match those of the more traditional fly- ing saucers. There are hundreds of known military encounters with UFOs. Most of these cases do not indicte overt hostility, but neither are they especially congenial. Judging by the behaviors of both the American aircraft and of these objects, the UFOs do not appear to be under the command of the U.S. military. This can also be said of at least some of the triangles, such as the one that vio- lated the air space over the Indian Point Nuclear Facility in 1984. For many years people have been hanging around the outskirts of Area 51, watching all the fun things that fly around there. Bob Lazar and his friends were there in the late 1980s, filming bizarre craft that could hover and dart. In December 1990, Gary Schultz, a chemical physicist, was with a large group of people when they saw, in his words, \"a huge, glowing saucer, which was pulsat- ing a brilliant orange-red and flying slowly over the Jumbled Hills-and it was being followed by a military helicopter about a quarter mile behind.\" The object disappeared behind the hills and into the Nellis Air Force Range, while the helicopter eventually landed at a facility atop Bald Mountain. There are many such accounts. Is this evidence that the U.S. military is testing field propulsion, e.g. antigravity, flying saucers? Possibly. We may have come very close to such a revelation in the very curious October 1, 1990, issue of Aviation Week & Space Technology, large portions of which con- cerned deep-black technology programs, cryptic references to not-fully-understood exotic technology, and reports of black quiet triangles. Would the other shoe drop? Would someone seriously mention the \"U\" word? The magazine came perilously close to doing so. One wonders whether someone else urgently desired to hush all this up. It is worth mentioning that Phillip J. Klass, a long-time UFO debunker, was a Page 10 MUFON UFO Journal May 2004"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"leading figure with the publication. Nei- ther the staff of AW&ST, nor those of Jane s Defense Weekly have followed up in a serious way on this. Presumably they are still terrified of the UFO topic. Or perhaps there is some- thing more involved, a quid pro quo? Whatever the answer, they are the watch- dogs that never barked. Compare their silence to the fine work of journalist George Knapp. Here is a man who obtained many solid leads out of Area 51, several of which indicated ef- forts to understand and duplicate alien technology. He spoke to members of Congress who were blocked in their at- tempts to get answers. But no mainstream publication has followed up on his leads. Conclusion We are facing a situation in which we know that some triangles are ours (as the 1989 sighting by Chris Gibson demon- strates), some triangles are big, some are small, and some do not appear to be \"ours.\" If there is a single terrestrial explana- tion for this, it would have to be a shadow group, most likely among people deeply immersed in the world of black defense technology who developed their own agenda independent of any formally es- tablished government. One person with whom I write, and whose judgement I have come to trust, tells me he is \"ninety-five percent\" sure that somewhere along the line the U.S. military and scientific minds in the secret world have indeed developed operational field propulsion. In other words, defeated the problem of gravity, and are thus responsible for at least many of the triangles. Another per- son, someone in whom I place high es- teem and credibility, tells me he thinks it's unlikely this is so. While this is difficult to sort out, I am still left with a nagging question: if the American National Security State some- where along the line invented some ver- sion of the Flying Triangle, why is there no evidence that it has ever been used in our recent wars? Would it not have been useful during the Gulf War of 1991? Or now? There are, of course, answers to this question. It may have been used secretly and no one has found out. Or, the military planners may have believed that it was unnecessary for victory and hence still more valuable as something secret. Still, it seems odd. I think it's likely that there are secret, terrestrial, triangles out there. But it also looks to me that some, and perhaps most, of the triangles are \"not ours,\" that is, alien of some sort. In my own view, since I think this is true of the UFO phenom- enon in general, it is not especially diffi- cult to see it as true of the triangles. What we can say for now is that there is no explanation yet offered to the pub- lic that brings all these triangles down to earth. There is a large body of evidence that continues to elude conventional ex- planation. Notes 'Project Triangle website is at http:// homepage.ntlworld.com/project_ft/ 8 Walter J.

Indiana witnesses report \"humongous\" disc-shaped UFO with two sets of lights Roger Sugden, assistant state direc- tor, MUFON Indiana, and Stewart Hill, state section director, have completed a preliminary investigation of a reported sighting by Bev Carpenter at her home in Rochester, IN, about 10 PM on April 8, 2004. Ms. Carpenter reports that the object, which she said was \"humongous,\" disc- shaped, and with three lights to the left and three lights to the right, was about 400 yards away. She thought the object was 100 feet wide. She says her lights flickered four times, and her computer malfunctioned. Ms. Carpenter's 13-year- old granddaughter also saw the object. Another witness, Robbie Crull, who lives about half a mile from Ms. Carpen- ter, said it looked as though the object was in her yard. She thinks it is the same object seen by Ms. Carpenter. Gene Winters said that an object hov- ered 35-50 feet above the pond in his backyard. At least ten witnesses in the area have been located. Thus far, Sugden has found high magnetic readings in at least two loca- tions, including the pond. As Sugden and Hill checked out the area behind the Carpenter house where the object was thought to have hovered, they noted a circle of tree limbs on the ground, but no sign of burns. At that site, WSBT-TV news reporter Ray Roth focused his camera on Sugden, asking him questions about his activities. Suddenly the audio on Roth's camera mal- functioned, producing a \"buzzing\" not only in Roth's ear, but as background to the interview. The camera had worked just fine up at the house. Sugden produced an inexpensive tape recorder with a never-before-used tape, turned it on, spoke several sentences, and stopped the tape. He then replayed it. That same buzz could be heard in the background. When the group began walking back toward the house, Roth again checked his camera. The audio was again clear. Sugden tried the same experiment with the tape recorder. It, too, was clear.

Burleson, Ph.D. O n 23 March 2004, MUFON In- ternational Director John Schuessler called to inform me that he had been contacted by a woman in Clovis, NM, who had had a strange experience that she needed to consult someone about. So on Saturday, 27 March, 2004, my wife Mollie, who often assists me with investigations, and I drove from Roswell to Melrose, NM, a small town west of Clovis. For purposes of orientation we first drove out west of Melrose to the site that had been described to Mollie on the phone. We planned to return to this site with the witness(es) after the interview. Returning to Melrose, we met the wit- ness with whom Mollie had spoken and the other witness, her sister, at 11 AM at the Allsup's carryout store on the west end of the town. We suggested.that we all go to a nearby roadside restaurant and have the interview over coffee. (Preferred procedure of course is to opt for a wit- ness' home, but both women live in Clovis, 22 miles from Melrose, and we needed to be in Melrose for the later site visit.) When the interview began, the two witnesses proceeded to describe the ex- perience they had had six days earlier while driving. I will call the driver (the witness with whom Mollie had spoken first on the phone) Linda, and I will call her sister (the passenger) Anne. Both are in their mid-fifties. I am not using their real names; both women have insisted on not being identified. Subsequent discussion made it clear that while both witnesses had been re- luctant to discuss the case too widely for fear of ridicule, they were somewhat con- cerned about the event (Linda more so than Anne), and wished to tell the story to someone experienced in such matters. While I would normally have chosen, as a matter of standard procedure, to in- terview the two witnesses separately, Anne, who initially was reluctant to dis- cuss the experience at all with anyone, had indicated to Linda a strong prefer- ence to be interviewed only in the com- pany of her sister, and I chose to con- duct the interview jointly in order to re- spect the wishes of all concerned. I was aware, at this point, that Linda had drawn a sketch of her impressions of Anne's sketch. the sighting and had insisted that Anne do so as well, independently of (not hav- ing seen) Linda's sketch. I felt assured, and my assurance grew as the interview progressed, that both women are given to forming their own impressions independently, and, al- though clearly having had basically the same experience, are not hesitant to dif- fer from each other in the details of their recollections when appropriate. I should mention also that although the experience that these witnesses have described is rather bizarre, I and Mollie have found both Linda and Anne to be highly intelligent, very articulate, very straightforward, most congenial in their manner, and, I am convinced, sincere. On the evening of Sunday, 21 March, 2004, Linda and Anne were driving Linda's 1993 Cadillac from Santa Rosa, NM, back home to Clovis. They had left Santa Rosa at 5:45 PM, and had come down Route 84 to Fort Sumner and pro- ceeded eastbound on Route 60/84 toward Melrose and Clovis. About two miles out of Fort Sumner, Anne saw train lights; these were three lights in a triangular arrangement, two on the bottom and one on top. Mollie and I had seen such lights on several trains on the tracks that parallel Route 60/84 on the south side of the road soon after our ar- rival in Melrose, so we were quite famil- iar with the appearance of these lights. Linda's sketch After seeing the train lights, Linda and Anne found themselves uncharacteristi- cally disinclined to talk to each other un- til their arrival at a \"curve\" sign that I mea- sured (before the interview) as 11.8 miles west of the Allsup's store in Melrose. Previously they had been talking about Billy the Kid, his biography, and the Billy the Kid Museum, but fell silent coming out of Fort Sumner. Anne later had no memory of having passed through Taiban, a little settlement located not quite halfway from Fort Sumner to Melrose. When they came to the \"curve\" sign (with a \"curve\" icon) and drove past it a few yards to a \"speed limit 65\" sign, the experience really began. It was dark by now. Both women saw essentially the same thing, as later recounted to each other, though they did not speak of the matter to each other right away. It seemed to Linda, who was driving at approximately the speed limit of 65 miles per hour, that the road ahead began to narrow. I observed during the site visit that the road here in fact does not nar- row; it is a two-lane paved road of con- stant width until it reaches Melrose, where it becomes four-lane. The witnesses, familiar with this road, knew that it does not really narrow. Then it appeared to both women that the nar- rowing road also curved to the left, seem- ing to wind itself into a kind of spiral, Page 12 MUFON UFO Journal May 2004"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"MUF®N John F.

Actually the road some little distance beyond the signs curves gently to the right. In both Linda's sketch and Anne's sketch of this sighting, the spiral is shown lined with lights. In Linda's sketch, the spiral (drawn as a bull's-eye) is simply labeled \"lights,\" while in Anne's sketch individual lights are shown (as dots) tracing out a spiral corresponding to the shape into which the road seemed to have curled. Anne said that these lights individu- ally looked something like the lights on poles that some people have in front of their houses, but were elevated only about four feet above the road. There are no houses or other buildings near this stretch of road. Anne seemed to dwell more on these sorts of details than Linda, who was busy driving and was feeling that she was get- ting into difficulty with the road as they proceeded \"We were running out of road,\" she wrote on her sketch. But both percipients seem to recall essentially the same event overall. I had Anne hold an aspirin at arm's length, making an object angularly about the same apparent angular size as the full moon, or about thirty minutes of arc, and asked her how the individual lights com- pared in apparent size to the aspirin. She said that the lights she saw were definitely smaller, and gave the impres- sion of being about three feet apart, hori- zontally, and were arranged in a circle that she and Linda could see all the way around. Both percipients remembered the lights as appearing to be about four feet off the ground, and both thought that there were about 12 to 15 of them. This number of lights in a circular arrangement, given the apparent spacing, would imply a ring about 11.5 to 14.3 feet in diameter. Anne said Linda had mentioned at the time that the narrowing road and the lights ahead had a dizzying effect on her. Anne said she felt the same way, and had remarked, \"I'm glad I'm not driving.\" Linda told me that even though it ap- peared the road was narrowing and the car was running out of room, with a spiral configuration ahead and a little to the left, she felt at the time that the experience was somehow unreal, not really happen- ing, and felt no real inclination to apply the brakes. I asked, for clarification, whether this disinclination to slow or stop the car was connected to the sense of unreality men- tioned, and Linda said yes. This clarifies that the sense of unreality was something experienced at the time, and not some- thing merely coloring the memory of the experience later. She further explained that although she kept driving at about the same speed, the bull's-eye up ahead did not ever seem to be any closer. Anne then said that after they first saw the bull's-eye or spiral, the lights seemed to unwind from the spiral and flash past the car from front to rear on the right side, still elevated about four feet and passing at a distance just outside the passenger- side car window, as if above the shoulder of the road, much too close and too nu- merous to be train lights. The train tracks, as I paced them off later at the site, are about 250 feet south of the road. Both witnesses said that there was no sound associated with the sight- ing, even when the lights were flashing past the car. Anne represented them as going \"whoosh-whoosh-whoosh\" past the car window at (my estimate) about one-half-second intervals, but she was careful to add that there was really no \"whoosh,\" no sound. She said that the lights passed too quickly to count accurately, but there were possibly 15 to 20 of them. They took only a very few seconds to pass, and then they were gone. Anne later added that on reflection she was not entirely sure that the lights were really unwinding off the spiral; it was sim- ply mat some lights (curled into a spiral) were out in front and a little to the left, and sometime afterward some lights were flashing past the car, though she was currently unsure whether the flash-by lights were in fact directly \"from\" the spi- ral configuration. Then Anne said-with Linda in agreement-that as soon as the flash-by lights were past, the whole scene seemed to return to normal, with the road straight again and no longer narrowed, and with other cars visible ahead and behind. They had realized in retrospect that up to this point there had been no other cars in evidence since leaving Fort Sumner. Mollie and I noted while at the site that the road is generally quite busy with traffic. In a subsequent telephone interview on 3 April, 2004, when I asked Linda how much farther she had to drive for them to reach Melrose after the scene returned to normal, she said it was still about 11 miles. Since the signs where that part of the experience began are not quite 12 miles from town, I infer that the \"spiral visible ahead\" phase of the experience seems to have involved driving only a short dis- tance-only a fraction of a mile. However, Linda mentioned during this later phone interview that the \"spiral\" experience subjectively seemed to last a considerable time, certainly longer than anything consistent with driving only a short physical distance down the road. The existence of this discrepancy cor- relates well with both women's feeling that there was something surreal about the whole experience of driving toward the spiral, and correlates also with the later realization that there was missing time. On 3 April, 2004, Mollie and I received a note from Anne, to whom I had posed the same question about the remaining distance to Melrose. She wrote, \"It took us about ten minutes to drive to Allsup's after we saw the lights.\" Given the speed of 65 miles per hour, this is entirely con- sistent with Linda's response. When Linda and Anne did get to Melrose they stopped at the Allsup's store on the west end of town. At this point Linda received a call on her cell phone from her granddaughter, and Linda noted that the call was logged as having occurred at 7:43 PM. Neither Linda nor Anne realized yet that this was later than it should have been after a drive from Santa Rosa, which normally would have taken substantially less than the two hours that had elapsed. Anne came out of the restroom in Allsup's, and was somewhat annoyed to find that her sister was telling the store workers about the strange experience they had had. Anne at that moment felt they should not be discussing the matter with anyone, as the whole thing sounded crazy. Linda told me, in fact, that when she and Anne later described the event to Linda's granddaughter, the granddaugh- ter jokingly responded, \"What have you and Aunt [Anne] been smoking?\" One of the Allsup's store crew, whose name Mollie and I later took note of, told Linda that someone else had recently mentioned an apparent UFO sighting. In a subsequent investigation, Mollie was able to identify and locate this other wit- ness, and I interviewed him by telephone on 30 March, 2004. His account was one of seeing, on about 9 March, 2004, by daylight and in his workplace, which was outdoors and about a mile from Linda and Anne's site, an unidentifiable \"yellowish-amber\" light that disappeared into the clouds over Taiban, west of Melrose. He mentioned a friend's having told May 2004 MUFON UFO Journal Page 13"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"Incision on Linda's back. him of a radio report two or three days before this sighting, to the effect that an unidentified object had been sighted at high altitude in the same area; reportedly the military had somehow been involved in this event. While the Taiban sighting (the yel- low-amber light) seems of doubtful rela- tionship to Linda's and Anne's event, it does serve to suggest that there may well have been some sort of UFO activity in the area fairly recently. After their brief stop at Allsup's, Linda and Anne continued on to Clovis, nor- mally (for a 22-mile stretch of road) about a 20-minute drive. The two women were still not talking about their experi- ence, though at length they did talk about the other \"Allsup's event\" (with the green lights) and joked about having been abducted. They reached home in Clovis at 8:45 PM, three hours after leaving Santa Rosa, which at 82 miles should have been a drive of at most half the elapsed time, despite the brief stop at Allsup's. It was only upon arriving in Clovis that they realized there was lost time-at least an hour to an hour and a half unaccounted for. Linda felt rather ill that night, and Anne said Linda was somewhat irritable at work the next day. Linda found herself not sleeping very well. Early in the week that followed, she noticed that she had somehow acquired what seemed to be a small cut in the middle of her lower back. It was not generally painful. During the interview process at the restaurant, Mollie accompanied Linda to the ladies' room, where Linda showed her the cut, which appeared to be perhaps a quarter of an inch long—a narrow slit with a suggestion of faint rash-like dots around it. Meanwhile, Anne sketched the cut for me as she had seen it, and in her sketch it looked a little like a question mark with- out the dot underneath; Anne said that the cut was more open at the curve on top, like a sort of flap, though to Mollie it looked more linear and uniformly narrow. Anne said that she herself had a little indentation or bruise (Linda said it looked like a freckle) on her left shoulder, and mentioned that it felt tender. Mollie was shown this too, but saw it only as a tiny red spot slightly swollen. In further discussion of the experience on the road, both women said that what they had seen looked not so much like an object, in or over the road ahead, as like the road itself curving into a tight circle lined with lights some four feet off the ground. Later when they accompanied us to the site out on the highway, Anne pointed to reflectors about four feet up on poles beside the road, and said that this was about the height of the lights as they were flashing past the car. I should note that such reflectors on this stretch of road occur at much wider intervals than anything corresponding to Anne's memory of lights passing in very close succession, and such reflectors pro- duce lights much smaller and fainter than what the witnesses described. The two witness recollections do dif- fer very slightly in emphasis. Linda's stronger impression was of the road itself curving ahead and leftward into a spiral (\"pavement-colored\" in the label- ing of Linda's sketch), while Anne mostly remembered the white lights themselves in that same spiral or bull's-eye pattern. Linda described the shape of the con- figuration as like the swirl of cream in a cup of coffee, but stressed that the \"swirl\" was one of shape rather than mo- tion. Both women agreed that the ring of lights was not actually spinning, so far as they could recall. Both agreed that at the time of the event they were calm, not feeling threat- ened or afraid. They formed no theories about what the lights might really be. Anne said that at the time she felt as if the spiral ahead of them seemed like a personal hallucination, though they later agreed on having seen essentially the same thing. I asked them if there had been any EM effect, such as the car engine stalling or sputtering, at any time during the event, and both witnesses said no. When the four of us drove out to the site, I took radiation readings. The wit- nesses had been wondering if they might have been irradiated, and while we were at the pulloff just east of the curve sign and not quite far enough down the road to be where the sighting event really started, I checked the side of their car and the witnesses themselves and found only background-level radiation. Background readings in the general area, however, appeared to be rather high, about 40 to 45 microroentgens, while in most places one is used to seeing about 15 to 25. The witnesses said that the event it- self began a little further east on the road, toward Melrose, just past the \"speed limit 65\" sign we could see from the pulloff. We drove both cars to the speed limit sign, and I took radiation readings on the shoulder of the readjust beyond the sign, finding the levels there somewhat higher than before, ranging from 70 to 110 microroentgens. I explained to the witnesses that this might or might not be significant with re- gard to their experience of the previous Sunday, since porous rock and paving materials can absorb a certain amount of radioactivity from the air, though read- ings two to three times background-level are always something to consider. Both Linda and Anne said that they felt a lot better after talking to us about the experience. Clearly this is a difficult case to as- sess. The percipients had, at the very least, a lost-time experience; that much is made precise by their detailed reporting of what the elapsed times were and what (on a road familiar to the witnesses) these times should have been. The logged time of the cell phone call is a particularly valuable piece of evidence that helps to establish the time line in general. The normal driving times are clearly established, and the actual elapsed times demonstrably do not fit them. One fundamental question, of course, is whether this experience is a UFO-re- lated event. Based on the accounts given, I would suggest that it would not be un- reasonable to associate the event with UFOs, especially given that both wit- nesses remember seeing something like a ring of lights a few feet above the road ahead of them, lights that apparently sped off past the car in a manner implying that they were aloft, if only a few feet off the ground. Naturally one tries to think of other ways to account for the experience as re- counted by the percipients, but mundane explanatory hypotheses are hard to come by. Another basic question, of course, is whether the witnesses may have had some sort of abduction experience. They did not mention the word \"abduction\" during the interview, except to remark that by the time they arrived back hi Clovis they had joked about being abducted. The physical anomalies, Linda's small cut on her back and Anne's tender in- dentation on her right shoulder, are the sort of thing that raises the possibility of abduction, especially with the lost-time element. This is where the case rests, unless one opts for hypnotic regression—an idea that did not seem unattractive to these witnesses when I mentioned it.

The top brightest light was slightly off to the left. The witness reports, \"We looked at the formation for a minute while it stayed stationary, and then the top brightest light began to move. It passed the car and changed position from the right of the car over to the left. \"Once we looked back at the remaining three lights, the next top one moved a little to the right, flew straight up, then disappeared into the sky. After driving a little while longer, we were shocked to find a number of blink- ing lights surrounding the car. \"After a short amount of time, the ob- jects disappeared, and we noticed we were being followed by a mysterious car. The car's headlights were so bright it caused my friend and me to comment on growing headaches. \"When we slowed to allow the car to pass, it came to a stop, and eventually fell behind us. The whole event lasted about ten minutes.\" Thanks to Peter Dav- enport, UFOcenter.

I said to my fiancee, \"Look, there is a UFO,\" in jest at first be- cause we are both sky-watchers. I said this because I am not used to seeing air- craft with dominant blue and green lights. \"There were six lights visible from the bottom of the craft-two with a blue and a green that were dominant. There were three yellow/white lights about 1/3 as bright as the green and blue lights. Also, a slightly fainter red light. \"The red light was on the leading edge of the triangle at the apex. Two-thirds of the way back to the base of the triangle were green and blue lights nearer to the edges. At the base were the three yellow/ white lights centered on the base between the green and blue lights. \"As it came closer and then right over us, it was very clear that this was not a helicopter. It was flying at 1200 feet alti- tude, and there was no sound. It seemed to be going no more than 80 miles per hour. I turned around to follow it and kept up pretty well at 50 MPH. \"I was in a residential area, and soon had to stop. We stopped and watched it for several minutes and saw a helicopter flying NW seemingly going towards this object. There was also another helicopter going directly N and to our left that seemed to also be headed in that direc- tion. It was very easy to hear and see that these were helicopters. \"As the triangle reached five miles north of us, it turned to the northwest.

Ohio disc paces cars SHEFFIELD LAKE - Around 11 PM on Friday night, March 19, 2004, three friends decided to go to a local pub and were driving west on US Route 6 to- wards Lorain at about 35 mph in light traf- fic. The road follows the southern shore of Lake Erie, homes line both sides of the road, and those on our right have the lake as their backyard. Two friends were in the first vehicle, and another friend was following. They could see a very bright white light ahead j on the right in a cluster of trees. They thought it might be a medical helicopter traveling along the shoreline, but it was not moving. As they cleared the trees there it was, about 50 feet above the lake right next to a large house. There was a very bright white light, but as they got closer they could make out faintly in the light a sau- cer-shaped object with a dome on top and one red and blue light below it-steady not flashing. The light was very intense, yet gave no reflection, not on the house nor on the ground. The witness states, I'm still driving westbound in some traffic. I slowed down and wanted to stop, but un- less you go into a driveway you can't. \"Then the object started moving, pac- ing us at about 30 mph, still maintaining its position over the shore line and going behind houses for thirty minutes, yet no reflection on anything. It looked to be about 20 to 25 feet-in diameter and did not change its appearance. \"All of a sudden a feeling of fear came over me, not just being afraid, but near terror. I was driving OK, and leaving about seven or eight car lengths behind the car in front because I was trying to make out exactly what the shape within that light was and keep along side of it. \"Then, I thought, what's with this fear. Then the fear left, and I had a feeling of contentment. We watched the ship the whole time, and after about five blocks we made the one traffic light, but the UFO started to speed up and flew faster and faster, heading west and climbing until its light became a pinpoint. \"The climb was very gradual as it ac- celerated away very smoothly. The per- son following us didn't see a thing. The geographical location is near Avon Point on Lake Erie. I downed a drink as soon as we got to the pub.\" Thanks to Peter Dav- enport, UFOcenter Nebraska pilot sees UFO OMAHA - This report is from an air traffic controller for Minneapolis Center, who stated, \"On March 25,2004, at 1900 hours, the pilot of an air carrier who was under my control reported two flights of two aircraft, but there were no other air- May 2004 MUFON UFO Journal Page 15"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"craft in the vicinity at the time. He said they were 15 miles in front of him at 35,000 feet, traveling away from him in a westerly direction. \"The UFOs stayed out in front of his aircraft for 15 minutes until the pilot said that the UFOs were so far out in front of him that he could hardly see them any- more. After being relieved of my duties I reported to my supervisor, who put me in contact with the Military Air Defense. \"The person at the other end of the phone said that they saw no objects in the area of this aircraft.\" Thanks to Peter Davenport. Three moving lights in Florida • NAPLES - Sitting on the beach on March 28,2004, at 10:50PM, a couple saw a bright light flash on the horizon as if it was signaling a light up north towards Sanibel Island. The northern light glowed bright enough to see a reflection in the water, and then all of the sudden it slowly split into three glowing objects. One went right, and one went left, leav- ing the original duller light in the same place. The light on the right went faster and flew out of sight. The one on the left stopped and returned to the original light and made it glow. At that moment the one on the horizon blinked again. The north light disappeared, leaving a dark spot. After four minutes, the light on the ho- rizon blinked again and the light to the north reappeared. It glowed so bright this time that the witnesses compared it to the full moon because of the reflection on the water. The light then split into three ob- jects again and formed a triangle. The northern light moved across the sky slowly, then darted out of sight. At that point the witnesses left the beach. UFOcenter. Saucers in Florida BRADENTON - On March 26,2004, at 7:50 PM, while trying to find the five planet alignment near the moon, a father and his 13-year-old son noticed two saucers rap- idly heading east towards them over the Pahna Sola Bay. The almond-shaped saucers appeared to be racing one another, side by side, but sometimes crossed each others paths. They were quite large, without lights or sound, and grayish in color with a haze surrounding them. When they were posi- tioned just under the moon, they turned sharply and headed south. It looked like they briefly slowed down over the baseball park lights and then headed southbound. When they were side by side, they were in identical forma- Page 16 tion. Once or twice they crossed in front of each other, but quickly went side by side again. The sky was quite clear, 72 degree tem- perature with a light breeze coming off of the bay. There were some distant planes flying, but none moved as fast. The sau- cers were much larger than a plane at 40,000 feet and flew as low as 20,000 feet. They darted up and down and hori- zontally for less than a minute, and then darted over towards the baseball park and seemed to almost stop for 30 seconds. Then they sharply flew north, then took a serious turn and headed south very quickly. Thanks to Peter Davenport, UFOcenter. California UFO photographed MODESTO - R. David Anderson writes, \"I am continuing to see UFOs at my place of residence, and I got a couple of pictures yesterday that are similar to the ones I took last weekend. Something flashed in my eyes as I was looking be- tween two trees where I have taken pho- tos earlier. \"It was an intense flash of light that left a strong after image on my eye. I have never before encountered anything like this. I shot one around 4 PM, with my new 4.3 digital camera. I saw the UFO to the north flying at about 30 mph, and it was probably about 250 feet high. I picked up the camera and began to take pictures, following its movement as it went from the northern sky to the eastern sky in about 45 seconds.\" Thanks to R. David Anderson. Washington Disc NEAR BAY - Four fishing vessels 50 to 60 miles off the west coast of Neah Bay watched a disc for half an hour. What appeared to be a disc-shaped large ob- ject with very bright lights was seen at 6:23 PM on March 16,2004. The object had mostly white lights, but there were also red and green lights that seemed to be mimicking the vessels' running lights for navigational purposes. The object would move at extreme rates of speed back and forth in a horizontal direction. Then, occasionally at a high rate of speed it flew straight up into the sky. The object seemed to hover above one of the vessels in particular, and then flew straight up into the sky and was gone. Washington object SEATTLE - The observer was driving south on 1-5 and noticed a jet flying east across the sky when another object with- out wings appeared at 1 PM on March 8, MUFON UFO Journal 2004. The witness reports, \"As I watched it more, what I at first thought was a jet was no jet, and the trail wasn't getting any longer. It was completely horizontal and fairly high in the sky, and as I looked at it more over a period of about a minute, I swear it looked like a perfect row of small windows going down the length of it. \"It also seemed to have a perfect, long, cylindrical shape, with the windows go- ing down the middle. I could tell it was cylindrical because the top and bottom kind of faded as if there was some round- ness to the object. I couldn't tell how high it was in the sky, but the object looked enormous. \"After about two minutes of watch- ing, the object performed a four-second fade out from being completely visible to disappearing completely. I've never wit- nessed the trail of a jet disappear that quick after .being visible for that long.\" Thanks to Peter Davenport, UFOcenter.

I was thinking, 'Where in the world were they landing?' From the middle of the town, they filled up the space where I could see the sky at the end of town. This is the first time I have actually seen anything so detailed, so close, and so big and in the daytime yet! \"When I got to the edge of town and could see the open field, there was abso- lutely nothing there at all-in the sky or in the field, nowhere! They just disappeared! These were so huge that they could have been seen for a mile at least, and did not appear to be going fast, just gliding along on a descent! \"I know the other people on the road with me saw them too. I kept watching the guy behind me as we left the town, and his head was turning all over the place like mine, trying to figure out where they went. He talked on his cell phone all the way to Fostoria. What a RUSH! I am so excited!\" Thanks to Susan Holderman.

As the planes passed, the object turned slowly vertically and ascended higher into the sky.and out of sight. \"The witnesses were adamant that this was a solid object. I contacted the local FAA office and inquired as to where there had been any pilot reported anomalous objects but received no conformation.\" Tennessee disc paces truck KNOXVELLE - Kim Shaffer received a call from a truck driver who witnessed a metallic disc on 1-40 just east of Knoxville on the afternoon of April 8, 2004. The witness reported that the disc paced his truck and was quite large, (relative size was that of a silver dollar), reflective, and seemed to rock side to side as it moved in a straight path. The witness stated that the object moved behind some trees, and he antici- pated seeing it again when he and the object passed the trees, but when he got past the trees the disc did not reappear. Thanks to Kim Shafer, MUFONTN State Director, http://www.mufontennessee.org Light on wing in Arizona BULLHEAD CITY, AZ&LAUGHLIN, NY - A couple was driving home on April 9,2004, at 8:05 PM, when they noticed a fairly bright light on an object directly in front of them to the north. What appeared to be the wing of the craft was illuminated by the bright singular light of the object as if in a hard bank. The witness reports, \"So the 'wing' was straight up and down, and was not hiding the large singular light, nor was it affecting the intensity of the light. At this time, my wife called her mother and had her look from her location, which was only a few blocks away north of our position. \"She attempted to get her video cam- era set up, but was unable to do so dur- ing the short time span. It was no more than five miles away, and made no sound. There was no wind, yet the object looked as if it were drifting in a large circle hung from a cable from high above. \"It appeared to keep the same altitude as it drifted east and west, pivoting in circles. It would slow as it reached the edge of its circular pivot. This was no May 2004 flare, and there was no smoke, and it didn't do a good job illuminating the ground. It was like a hot air balloon dan- gling a light below it. \"The single light was much brighter and ten times larger than Venus, the evening star, which was present \"just to the west. The light was a dim reddish color that tended to flicker slightly. When the object disappeared, the light simply went out as if you flipped a switch. \"I can't explain the cable or the 'wing\" structure above the light. I'm a trained observer, and work security for the fed- eral government. I've never seen a 'UFO' before. This object was seen by many others, and Laughlin Airport is five miles away, but it was not an aircraft.\" Thanks to Peter Davenport, UFOcenter. United Arab Emirates diamond DUBAI - The observer spotted a clear diamond-shaped object with blue and or- ange light that came close to landing, but did not land, at 2 AM on March 16,2004. The witness says, \"The light was true and real bright blue orange light, then the shape of the ship started to appear like a diamond. It started to close down to the face of the earth, and suddenly disap- peared away like lightning.\" Australia disc hovers PERTH - The witness reports, \"A disc- shaped object flew from a nearby hill, then overhead, in a ' V formation. It hovered for about three minutes, then flew over our heads in a suburban area in daylight at 12:24 PM on March 14,2004. It flew at a slow pace, then sped off extremely fast.\" Candadian cigar shapes NEW WESTMINSTER, BC - On April 4, 2004, at midnight the witness spotted two cigar-shaped UFOs that flew horizon- tally, traveling north with bright red fire- ball heads and long bright yellow tails. The two objects flew parallel to each other at a fairly low level at a steady pace, staying beside each other for two sec- onds before they disappeared! \"There was no sputter, fading or smoking,\" said the witness. \"They just disappeared! I've never seen anything like this before in my life.\" Canadian pilot reports lights SURREY, BC - On April 7,2004, at 9:45 PM, the witness, a pilot, saw three lights rapidly approaching from the west in a triangle formation \"at 12 o'clock low. The object between the lights was solid and triangular, and when the object banked north; the angular relationship between MUFON UFO Journal the lights was consistent with the bank- ing of an aircraft. \" • \"However,\" this was no ordinary air- craft. It moved completely silently and covered half the horizon that is from Sur- rey to the North Shore Mountains in about four seconds. I am 'guessing the altitude at 2000-3000 feet, and the bright- ness of the lights of the object relative to the brightness of passing aircraft lights at within 7000 feet. I felt it could not be man-made. The flight path of the object was directly over the approach path to YVR\" Disc in the Philippines VICTORIAS CITY - The witness spot- ted a disk-type object with a very bright light and a low sound on April 7,2004, at 9 PM. The witness states, \"We heard a sound like many people talking. The color of the light of that object changed to blue, red, violet, and orange. After fifteen min- utes it departed.\" Thanks to Peter Dav- enport, UFOcenter. Oval UFOs in Australia COOMA - The witness was sitting on the front porch of his home with some friends drinking argile on April 7,2004, at 11:44 PM. He reports, \"Suddenly we saw a flash of light, then a series of flashing lights for about 20 seconds. We spotted eight oval-shaped objects with white and blue flashing lights. \"They hovered in the distance for an- other minute, and then flew across the sky like ravenous demons, leaving a red haze trail of smoke behind. As they flew by over my home our lights turned off, our cars would not start, and our radios were buzzing for about five minutes after they were out of the vicinity. \"Being frightened by what we saw, we called the police. They thought we were pranksters, so we then decided to flee our homes and traveled to Sydney, to stay hi a populated area with our families where we knew it would be safe.\" Thanks to Pe- ter Davenport, UFOcenter. New York mystery photo WANTAGH - The photographer had been taking pictures of the sunset. When developing the pictures, he saw a white sphere in the background and enlarged it, showing what appears to be a UFO at 5 PM on March 14,2004. The white color was shaped like a sphere, but had something white spilling from underneath in the center like a tear drop. The sun was already setting well below the object leaving it against a dark blue backdrop. Peter Davenport, UFOcenter. Page 17"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"By Jenny Randies Jenny Randies Hot spots and cold beer I was amused to see a new TV adver- tising campaign for Grolsch lager that fea- tures alien contact as its running theme. It is spookily filmed in what could easily have been Rendlesham Forest. If treated as pure entertainment, it is certainly jolly good fun, but there has been some dis- content in the UK from researchers who think that this is doing down the sobriety of the UFO subject-especially when ex MoD man turned UFO writer Nick Pope revealed that he was a con- sultant in the PR exercise that accompa- nied the campaign. What do I think about this? Well, it is easy to take UFOlogy too seriously, and there is no harm in the odd chuckle over what is, let us face it, an inherently bi- zarre phenomenon. I have helped a few TV adverts myself in the past-although never ones connected with anything as potentially contentious as intoxicating li- quor. Over the years I have dealt with hun- dreds of cases, but those that stick in my mind are the ones that have that touch of humor. If I ever get around to writing my memoirs (not that any publisher would be daft enough to want me to do that), I know there would be plenty of amusing stuff in there because it would not be a true reflection of the subject if I failed to include humor alongside the awe and mystery. There would be the man who got ar- rested after chasing a UFO in his night attire. Or the alien that terrified a local shopping mall, but that turned out to be from the dog star instead. And how could I avoid telling the story of how I once played a part in an intergalactic war be- tween a group of aliens disguised as birds, and others that took the form of mail boxes? As for crop circles, they would need a chapter all of their own to record the an- tics that I have encountered during my 30 years in the field. So I do not object to the Grolsch ads, as ads, or because they are meant to be funny. But I do recall what the great UFOlogist Allen Hynek once told me- about how he was asked to do a TV ad- vert promoting beer and precisely why he turned it down. Allen did not suffer from an amuse- ment by-pass. He loved Monty Python, for example, and that takes a special kind of appreciation of what is funny. How- ever, he was worried about how the pub- lic might link UFOs with beer swilling, and from these associations draw the conclu- sion that perhaps this was not a proper field of scientific study, but something born out of undue inebriation instead. On a later trip to the states I saw what might have been the planned TV campaign in which a real life UFO witness was ex- tolling the virtues of some brew or other, and I saw that Allen was perfectly right to say no. My view was not, \"Oh, here is a sen- sible, reliable person who clearly saw something strange,\" which very probably is exactly what the witness was. My think- ing went, \"Oh, here's a guy who likes a jar or two and says that he sees aliens-er, might the two things not be related?\" I know UFOlogy far too well to be- lieve that this was true, and I quickly re- jected any opinion of this case built around a TV ad. But I knew that 99% of the audience would have no way of put- ting this story into proper context, and may well judge not just this witness or his case, but the entire UFO mystery on their hurried first impression from a few seconds on a TV ad. So, perhaps it is sometimes wise to be careful about who we agree to help when they wish to use the cultural popularity of UFOs as a means to plug some prod- uct or other. We need to balance its dis- advantages against its advantages. Are there any advantages from the Grolsch campaign? Nick Pope's role in it seems to have been to come up with a list of top UFO hotspots in Britain. I have no idea how he came up with them; but I have done my own list based on the 15,000 cases in the British UFO Research Association (BUFORA) data files over the past 50 years. It has very little in common with Nick's list-which features locations such as Rendlesham Forest and Bonnybridge at the head, when both very clearly have sound reasons that skew them towards looking like hot spots for social rather than UFOlogical reasons. Indeed some of the places where UFO sightings seem to recur regularly over long periods are entirely absent from the Grolsch list. What does this prove? That lists of UFO hot spots are subjective and unlikely to prove anything? Possibly. Or that fash- ions change, and what Nick Pope has dis- covered to be hot today was not quite so hot yesterday. Again, perhaps. However, what is undoubtedly true is that the hot spots listed by Nick for Grolsch-featured all over Britain in me- dia source after media source-were sur- prised and delighted to announce to the public that they are a haven for ET tour- ists. It remains to be seen if this has a posi- tive or negative effect on how these lo- cals or media judge UFOlogy, but you can at least argue that Nick Pope was able to turn the Grolsch ads to some UFO ad- vantage by getting the topic in the public eye. Unsolved Mysteries DVDs to debut with \"UFO Files\" In its first foray into a TV sell-through product, independent film supplier First Look Media has nabbed the DVD rights to the TV series Unsolved Mysteries, and will begin distributing the show on DVD in September. First Look plans to release Unsolved Mysteries in genre-specific box sets, be- ginning with \"The UFO Files\" on Sept. 7, \"Scariest Ghost Stories\" on Oct. 5 and \"Astonishing Miracles\" on Nov. 9. Three more sets, \"Bizarre Murders,\" \"Mysterious Legends,\" and \"Incredible Psychics and ESP,\" are scheduled for re- lease in 2005. Each 4-disc box set will comprise the best episodes from each genre in the se- ries, which ran for 12 years on NBC and CBS, and will contain more than 6 hours of content. \"The UFO Files\" will feature some of the best known UFO researchers, includ- ing many members of MUFON.

Friedman Friedman More debunking in S&T Sky and Telescope is one of the old- est and most respected magazines deal- ing with astronomy on a popular level. Unfortunately, it slipped into debunking mode in the May, 2004, issue with an ar- ticle \"A Commonsense Guide to Cosmic Nonsense\" (pp38- 43) by astronomer Philip C. Plait. It seems to be aimed at young teenagers, with cartoon illustra- tions, loads of pe- jorative labels such as \"cranks, crackpots, wackos, or woo woos.\" He created the Bad Astronomy website (www.badastronomy.com). Plait doesn't seem to be aware of how much bad astronomy has been foisted on the public by professional astronomers over the last 150 years or so. The article deals with several different topics, such as astrology, The Apollo Moon Hoax, alien abductions, and UFOs. One thing missing from the article is any indication that he really knows anything about astrology or alien abductions or UFOs. His comments on the claims that we didn't go to the moon aren't too bad. There are a few websites.noted (no UFO ones, such as mine at www.v-j-enter- prises.com/sfpage.htrnl), but no books, no large scale scientific studies, and no or- ganizations such as MUFON. Plait offers three rules for what to do when someone \"bludgeons you with ba- loney: Be patient, Know your stuff, Know your resources.\" Not bad rules when deal- ing with the pseudoscientific anti- ufologists either. Plait isn't the first to make proclama- tions. For example, he says, \"Just because people report unidentified flying objects doesn't mean that spaceships are buzz- ing around.\" He doesn't tell us who it is that makes such claims. Then he says, \"Countless UFOs will never be identified simply because there aren't enough good observations to dis- cern what 'that thing in the sky' was.\" What about all those excellent observa- tions involving apparently metallic, manu- May 2004 factured objects behaving in ways that clearly indicate that they are under intel- ligent control and resisting full time ef- forts by professional people trying to identify them? What about the several thousand land- ing trace cases such as those collected by Ted Phillips? What about the multiple witness radar visual cases? Plait acts as if there are no such observations. He continues with this gem: \"But as- suming that aliens come here to mutilate our cattle and stick 1980s-level computer chips in our necks seem rather far- fetched.\" Who says that is why aliens come here or that they are mutilating our cattle or sticking computer chips in our necks? I recall there were companies in the computer industry not too many years ago who said nobody would buy a com- puter just to maintain their checkbook or gather recipes, or keep a Christmas list. Several companies found that lots of people wanted a home computer for many other reasons, and that the more that were built, the cheaper they became and the more applications were found. The guys who invented the laser had no idea that they would be used for at- taching retinas, drilling holes in baby bottle nipples, or checking us out at the grocery store. Aliens may be checking out our mineral resourses because we are the densest planet in the solar system. They may be checking on their colony, collecting specimens for genetic research, or just trying to make sure we are not al- lowed to take our vicious brand of friend- ship (hostility) out to the local neighbor- hood. They may be graduate students do- ing their research on a primitive society, whose major activity is tribal warfare, be- fore we destroy ourselves. Maybe they are being punished: spend two weeks on earth; punishment to last a lifetime. Back to sighting reports. In \"Blue Book Special Report Number 14\" it was found by professionals at Battelle Me- morial Institute working on an Air Force contract that 21.5% of 3,201 sightings could NOT be identified, completely sepa- rate from the 9.3% that were listed as In- sufficient Information. Even restricting our attention to the highest quality cases it was found that 35.1% of the 308 Excellent cases had to MUFON UFO Journal be listed as UNKNOWNS, while only 18.3% of the poor cases were so listed. Let's be clear here that UNKNOWN did not mean not enough data. Here are the BM definitions: \"UNKNOWNS-Re- ports of sightings wherein the descrip- tion of the object and its maneuvers could not be fitted to the pattern of any known object or phenomenon\" ... \"INSUFFI- CIENT INFORMATION.. .when upon fi- nal consideration there was some essen- tial item of information missing, or there was enough doubt about what data were available to disallow identification as a common object or some natural phenom- enon.\" I am sure Plait would never claim that there are no black holes, no neutron stars, or no huge giant stars just because the great majority of stars are not black holes, neutron stars, or huge giants. The scientific method involves focus- ing on the data relevant to the problem at hand: sightings which can't be identified by competent professionals spending as much time as is necessary, rather than the data related to those sightings which can be explained. Plait comments, \"If aliens built the Face on Mars, why did they build some- thing a mile across that would erode? Why not make a smaller object from more durable materials?\" Notice the mess of assumptions made here. Plait knows how old the Face is and that it hasn't remained pristine, and even why it was built! If it was built a million or billion years ago and had gone through marsquakes, meteor bombardment, mas- sive floods, powerful windstorms, etc, it may have done extremely well in the du- rability department. The Great Wall of China is 4000 miles long. There are places that are eroded. He goes on with this gem: \"If Roswell is the crash landing site of a spaceship, it means that aliens had the technology to travel trillions of kilometers, but lost con- trol just a few hundred meters above the ground. Who built their transports? Microsoft?\" Here again we have a crazy assump- tion that a small Earth Excursion module traveled all the way on its own and then just failed. Did he never consider the use of huge space carriers, analogous to our aircraft carriers? There are many excellent reports of \"mother\" ships more than half Page 19"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"a mile long, apparently to do the heavy lifting from Zeta Reticuli or wherever. Would Plait suggest that the Ameri- can bombs and cruise missiles dropped on Iraq all flew directly from the United States rather than being carried there on very much larger aircraft carriers? He ig- nores the possibility of external factors such as powerful lightning strikes, run- ning into a powerful radar beam known to be on and aimed heavenward, or even a mid-air collision. Forty percent of the 800+ UFO obser- vations listed by Ted Bloecher in his \"Re- port on the UFO Wave of 1947\" involved more than one unidentified object being seen at a time. Would Plait suggest that an enormously sophisticated multi-billion dollar large flying vehicle could never be destroyed? Perhaps he hasn't heard of the two shuttle disasters that have oc- curred. Plait claims, \"In law, eyewitness testi- mony is suspect.\" Of course it is; that is why there are prosecutors and defense attorneys and judges and juries. What every prosecutor wants is eyewitness testimony. Think of the OJ Simpson trial. DNA is nice, but the very great majority of cases do not involve DNA. Plait makes it sound as though as- tronomers are the best observers around, and that they never see UFOs. Surveys by J.A.Hynek, Peter Sturrock, and Gert Herb all showed that both amateur and professional astronomers do see UFOs. Unfortunately, they rarely report what they see because of the ridicule of people like Plait. He notes that most people, except as- tronomers, have never seen Iridium sat- ellite flares, sundogs, or Venus. Does he really believe that all UFO sightings oc- cur at night and are just points of light in the sky? I hope not. He obviously doesn't understand that the reason most sightings can be explained as relatively conventional phe- nomena is that people are good observ- ers, but poor interpreters. We know some- one was watching Venus because his description of its brightness, its angle above the horizon, and location in the sky at a particular time match those of Venus. Plait doesn't like pictures or videos of UFOs either. He trashes the notion of good pictures with this gem: \"There has never been a video that has convinced more than a minority of watchers that aliens are real.\" No clue is provided to justify this absurd claim. How many videos or stills has he ob- served that have passed muster after ob- jective evaluation by professionals such as optical physicist Dr. Bruce Maccabee? Speaking of witness testimony, Plait says, \"Consider this: Who are the most credible witnesses for various sky phe- nomena? Amateur astronomers, of course. So why do so few reports come from this group?\" Because they are terribly intimidated by the Plaits of the world!! \"Amateurs spend countless hours simply looking up (he might have said .. at night..). Logi- cally they should be reporting most of the UFOs.\" More nonsense, and certainly not logic. Even if 1% qualify as amateur as- tronomers, and half of them saw a UFO, that would still be a smaller number than say 10% of the other 99% of the popula- tion. I would say pilots are much better able to evaluate and describe UNKNOWN vehicles flying in the atmosphere within view of their planes, especially when in communication with radar operators on the ground and in touch with other pilots seeing the same things. Are amateur astronomers any better than anybody else at describing unusual vehicles flying in unusual ways and of- ten seen on the ground? Astronomers al- most never deal with animated intelli- gently controlled activities such as auto accidents, bank robberies, or evasive fly- ing saucers. Fortunately there are such groups as NARCAP (National Aviation Reporting Center for Anomalous Phenomena- www.narcap.org) with people like Ted Rowe and Dr. Richard Haines available to deal with the reports from PROFES- SIONAL sky observers. Pilots. Plait seems ignorant about astrology, prattling on about the strength of all forces decreasing with the square of the distance and implying that planets can't affect people. He neglects the astronomical fact that the center of gravity of the solar system is not, because of the planets, in the cen- ter of the sun. Changes in the gravitational field at the surface of the sun can trigger solar storms which can, in turn, trigger many electromagnetic disturbances on Earth and in people. Mr. Nelson of RCA used his knowledge of planetary positions to predict when there would be a need for using land lines instead of radio waves for communication here. It might not hurt to point out that it was astronomers who claimed that Venus was a tropical paradise with steamy jungles, and that Mars was a dead planet which could not ever have had life, among a long list of false pronouncements. Turns out the clouds on Venus are sulfuric acid, and the temperature is about 600 F. Mars has indeed had copious quan- tities of water. And, indeed, some UFOs are alien spacecraft, whether Mr. Plait likes it or not. Arrogant ignorance is no substitute for knowledge. Stan Friedman fsphys@rogers.com Director's Message...

The collection, which is housed in the Gushing Library and Archives, contains field notes, interviews, documents, drafts, manuscripts and artifacts collected dur- ing the course of the University of Colo- rado Study, headed by Edward Condon and sponsored by the Air Force. The project team under Craig was charged with searching for sound evi- dence to prove or disprove the idea of UFOs, but the study and its leaders were anti-UFO from the beginning. Craig, who was also anti-UFO, later wrote his own book about the project, UFOs: An Insider s View, providing his perspective on the study and the report.

It sets only about 3/4 hour after the Sun on June 1. See \"Morning Sky\" and \"Ve- nus Transits the Sun.\" Mars (magnitude 1.8), moving from Gemini into Cancer, is faint and very low in the WNW at twilight, setting about 10:30 PM in midmonth. The dim ruddy planet becomes lost in the solar glare late in June. Find it near the lunar crescent on June 19 and 20. Jupiter (-2.0), in Leo, stands out in the WSW at dusk, advancing to the WNW where it sets about 12:30 AM in mid-June and about 11:30 PM on the 30th. The gi- ant planet pairs up nicely with the cres- cent Moon on the 23rd. Saturn (0.1), in Gemini, lies very low in the WNW at twilight (below Mars). On the 1st it sets about 10:30. By midmonth, Saturn sets an hour earlier and then dis- appears into the solar glare. Bright Planets (Morning Sky) Venus emerges into morning-sky vis- ibility in mid-June, low in the ENE and rising about 4:30 AM. By month's end, the brilliant planet rises about 1 1 12 hours before the Sun. Look for it below the ris- ing crescent Moon on the 16th. Venus Transits the Sun: For the first time in more than 121 years, many will have an opportunity to see one of the rarest of celestial events- a spectacle so rare that no one alive has ever seen it! On June 8 the planet Venus crosses the face of the Sun. While most of Eu- rope, Africa, and Asia can experience the entire 6-hour transit, the event will already be in progress at sunrise from the eastern and central U.S. (None of the event is visible from the western states.) The farther east one is, the higher the Sun will be. The last two hours of the transit can be seen from the eastern U.S. after the Sun rises. Crossing the south- ern solar disc, Venus exits at the right edge of the Sun. Sample city egress times (AM local): Boston, New York, Atlanta, Cleveland, all 7:26; Miami, 7:28; Chicago, Kansas City (KS & MO), 6:25; New Orleans, 6:27. Unlike a Mercury transit, the silhou- etted circular disc of Venus will be visible to the naked eye. However, as with solar eclipses, do not look directly at the Sun without using a safe filter, such as a #14 welder's glass or mylar solar filter specifically designed for eclipse or solar viewing! Also the Sun's image can be projected through a binocular or telescope eyepiece onto a white surface for safe indirect viewing. There will be one more chance to see another Venus transit-June 5,2012. The Stars: The stellar trio that forms the Summer Triangle advances up the eastern sky in the late evening. Each star in the geo- metrical figure resides in its own constel- lation-Vega in Lyra the Harp, Deneb in Cygnus the Swan, and Altair in Aquila the Eagle. The spring patterns-Leo, Bootes, and Virgo-have slid past the meridian into the W. Low in the SE creeps Scorpius the Scorpion, with its red heart star Antares and distinctive curved stinger tail. The Archer Sagittarius is right behind the ven- omous creature. Moon Phases: Full moon-June 3 .... Nearest Moon of the year Last quarter-June 9 New moon-June 17 ....

First I thought it was a bright star that I had never seen before, then I recorded it on my camera for about 20 minutes. \"It was moving very fast, sometimes zigzagging; becoming bigger and smaller. The bottom part, about one third of the object, was dark in color, yet the upper part was white. On its top were sharp pro- jecting points like honeycombs. \"It would disappear when observed with the naked eye, then would appear again. On the camera, it would look as small as a pin top, then in 2-3 seconds it would grow as big as an orange. It looked like a flying saucer.\" Mr. Yildiz said he was visited yester- day by people from Sinus UFO Research Centre, and they studied the footage. They said that it was not a satellite nor a meteorological object. They think it is a UFO. Now the footage will be studied by Cukurova University. -Esen Sekerkarar, MUFON Represen- tative for Turkey esensk@superonline.com WUFOD login & password for MUFON members WUFOD is MUFON's Worldwide UFO database, linked to the MUFON homepage.

Reviewed by Dwight Connelly This first issue is quite interesting as Dick, one of the true giants of ufology, mixes historical re- ports, historical view- points, background on the archives, and background informa- tion on the National Investigations Com- mittee on Aerial Phe- nomena (NICAP). Web sites related to UFO history are listed, there is a brief inventory of the Keyhoe Archives, and there is even recommended reading. A feature in this first issue is an inter- esting interview with Wendy Connors, who is locating and preserving audio re- cordings from ufology from 1938 to the late 1970's. Those interested in the history of ufology, particularly as compiled by Keyhoe and NICAP, will find Dick's jour- nal quite worthwhile. Hall, a close colleague of Keyhoe, says the future of the publication \"will depend on market forces.\" He explains, \"If enough people are willing to subscribe, the supply of historical information on hand is nearly unlimited, and publication can go on indefinitely. If the support is not there, this journal may be short-lived.\" He notes that he has not been able to completely inventory the archives, since no funding is available for that purpose, but he does know that the collection con- tains the correspondence of such re- searchers as Dr. James E. McDonald, sev- eral hundred articles, many case files, government files, about 300 UFO books, and hundreds of audio and video tapes. The archives items are available, by appointment, to \"legitimate journalists, scientists, and reputable investigators.\" Additional information on the archives is available at Dick's web site: www.hallrichard.com. This is a welcome addition to ufology, and deserves widespread support. The Phoenix Lights-a Skeptic's Discovery That We Are Not Alone by Lynne D. Kitei, M.D.; 2004, Hampton Roads Publishing Co., 1125 Stoney Ridge Rd., Charlottesville, VA 22902; 6x9 soft cover, 304 pages, $16.95. Reviewed by Dwight Connelly The well-known formation of lights over Phoenix, AZ, on March 13, 1997, was witnessed by hundreds of individu- als, including the author of this book, Dr. Lynne Kitei. But Dr. Kitei says she had seen strange lights before. On Feb. 6,1995, she and her husband had seen three orbs of light less than a hundred yards from their property, about 50 to 75 feet in the air.. Dr. Kitei rushed for a camera, even as the lower light was dissappearing, but she was able to get a photo of the re- maining two as the lower left orb was dis- appearing, but the right oval was still in place. From that point on, she kept a camera nearby in case she saw them again. Over the next two years she took numerous video and still photos of mese lights. As a respected physician, educator, wife, and mother, she had not felt com- fortable publicizing these activities, but the March 13, 1997, sightings by hun- dreds of individuals seemed to make her research more respectible, and she gradu- ally became involved publicly. This book is the account of her re- search into the lights, as she sought as much scientific information as possible about what her films might hold. However, she also began to delve into the possible meanings that the lights may hold, and this took her into such realms as Near Death Experiences (NDE's), crop circles, and other phenomena. It is clear that this experience with the Phoenix Lights has changed Dr. Kitei's perspective on life. She offers, for ex- ample, ten suggestions \"to help you build your own connection to the lifelines of the living energy universe.\" In October, 2001, following 911, she was meditating on the world situation when she again saw three amber lights in a triangle over Phoenix. \"The sight was a reassuring phenomenon,\" she says. \"They do know, they do care....\" Dr. Kitei's book includes numerous photos, extensive endnotes, three appen- dixes, and an extensive bibliography.

It is one of the first events happening as a part of the annual MUFON International UFO Symposium. This is an excellent opportunity for state directors to get together and ex- change ideas about what works for them and what does not. MUFON state direc- tors are part of our vast volunteer net- work striving to solve the UFO mystery. They are key to UFO investigations in their respective states by assigning field investigators, overseeing and guiding investigations, recruiting new members, sending report to MUFON Headquarters and to the MUFON UFO Journal, estab- lishing media contacts, developing com- munications with and the of trust of state- wide police, emergency, and investigative agencies, holding state meetings, and dealing with problems as well as suc- cesses. In addition to it being an opportunity to recognize the work of the state direc- tors and their teams of volunteers, the state directors' meeting is a chance to share success stories with everyone present. That allows everyone to learn from the work that has already been done. It also a chance to find out how others have solved problems encountered in doing the day-to-day MUFON work and to bring problems to the attention of MUFON Headquarters. UFO sightings are on the rise. That means more resources will need to be applied to investigations and reporting. One way to do that is to forge new rela- tionships with MUFON members in adja- cent states. Get to know the people and work together when an incident occurs that could involve more than one state group. The state director may submit a writ- ten report ahead of the symposium meet- ing date or wait and submit it at the state director's meeting. State directors that are unable to attend the meeting should delegate the meeting attendance to an- other representative from their state. Of course, assistant state directors are al- ways welcome to attend as well. Press Releases MUFON Headquarters wants to im- prove the process of making press re- leases on scheduled events, case inves- tigations, completed research, personnel promotions, publications by members, and anything else that is newsworthy. Some press releases are best done at the state level. Some examples are local meetings, completed investigations, per- sonnel assignments, etc. Other things are more appropriately released at the headquarters level. If done at the state level, a copy should be sent to headquarters to keep everyone in- formed and for possible reuse by head- quarters as well. Press releases are an important way to keep the public and media informed about our activities and to recognize the good work of our volunteers. The Internet makes the process of is- suing press releases easy. A list of all newspapers, radio stations, television stations and state government offices may be found online at www.50states.com. Find the appropriate entity and send them an email contain- ing your press release. National UFO Reporting Center Probably only about ten percent of all UFO sightings are reported. The ones that are reported go to the MUFON website and the -World UFO Database (WUFOD), to CUFOS, FUFOR, NIDS, Filer's Files, Skywatch International, and others. MUFON has a good working re- lationship with all of these groups be- cause we believe we have a mutual goal / to solve the mystery. In addition, Peter Davenport, Director of the National UFO Reporting Center (NUFORC), is sending a huge number of UFO reports to MUFON to investigate. Peter receives this vast number of re- ports by email and telephone, and lists them on his website. Since he has no investigative organization, he shares worthy reports with MUFON state direc- tors for follow-up. All he asks in return is a copy of the final investigative report so he knows the results of the investigation. This is a win- win situation for everyone involved- MUFON, NUFORC, and the witnesses. Peter will be speaking at the July 2004 MUFON International UFO Symposium in Denver. I hope you will all take this opportunity to get to know him and forge new or renewed links with him.
