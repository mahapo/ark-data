January 2007 Number 465 (Continued on page 22) Directors Message By James Carrion James Carrion A UFO milestone This year marks a milestone in UFO history, the 60 th anniversary of the mod- ern UFO era. Although UFOs may well have been with us for millennia, it is that water- shed day of June 24, 1947–Ken- neth Arnold’s fa- mous sighting– that introduced the UFO phe- nomenon to the popular culture. Anniversaries are not only rea- sons for celebra- tion but also for retrospection. After 60 long years, 37 of which MUFON has been actively in- vestigating and studying this mystery, we should take the time to examine which questions have been answered and which ones still remain riddles. One question that has been defini- tively answered is whether UFOs are real or not. They are real and worthy of further scientific study. A question that has not been satis- factorily answered is what does MUFON’s mountain of investigated case data reveal about the nature of the UFO occupants and their motives–not to mention how related phenomenon such as abductions, crop circles, muti- lations, etc. fit into the equation. J. Allen Hynek once made the com- ment that even if there was never an- other UFO sighting from that day forth, there was enough accumulated sighting data to keep scientists busy research- ing the phenomenon for a long time. There have been major UFO studies that have come and gone, from the 1954 Project Bluebook Special Report 14 to the 1968 Condon Report to the 1968 Congressional Hearings on UFOs, but the amount of additional data that has since been collected by MUFON and others is mind boggling. Today MUFON finds itself on top of this mountain of unanalyzed data that"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"      3 MUFON UFO Journal January 2007 About the author Dr. Bruce S. Maccabee, MUFON UFO Photo Analyst, earned the B.S. in physics at Worcester Polytechnic Institute and the M.S. and Ph.D. in physics at The American University. In 1972 he began his career at the Naval Surface Warfare Center. Maccabee has been active in UFO research since the late 1960s when he joined the National Investi- gations Committee on Aerial Phe- nomena (NICAP). He joined MUFON in 1975 and was subsequently appointed State Di- rector for Maryland, a position he still holds. In 1979 he was instrumental in establishing the Fund for UFO Research and was the chairman for about 13 years. His UFO research and investiga- tions have included the Kenneth Arnold sighting (Jun 24, 1947), the McMinnville, OR (Trent) photos of 1950, the Gemini 11 astronaut pho- tos of September, 1966, the New Zealand sightings of December, 1978, the Japan Airlines (JAL1628) sighting of November 1986, the “red bubba” sightings,1990-1992 (includ- ing his own sighting in September, 1991), the Mexico City video of Au- gust, 1997, the Phoenix lights sightings of March 13, 1997, at 10 PM, the Mexican Air Force case of March, 2004, the Iran Jet Case of Sept. 1976, and many others. He has also done historical research and was the first to obtain the “flying disc file” of the FBI (the REAL X-Files!). Dr. Maccabee is the author or co- author of numerous technical and UFO articles over the past 25 years. He is co-author with Edward Walters of UFOs Are Real, Here’s The Proof, author of The UFO/FBI Connection, and the author of the novel Abduction in My Life. He has appeared on numerous ra- dio and TV shows, and spoken at symposia throughout the world. Bruce is an accomplished pianist and organist who performed at the 1997 and 1999 MUFON symposiums. By Bruce Maccabee T his is a report of the observa- tion, using an 8–14 micron thermal imaging system, of a strange “hot object” in the nighttime Florida sky. During the night of an unrecalled date in the early 1990’s (’90,’91, or ’92), Mark and his co-pilot, Jim (names known to MUFON) were flying a Bell 206B3 Jetranger helicopter as part of a law enforce- ment operation in the vicinity of Massey Air Park near Edgewater, FL. This is about six miles south of New Smyrna Beach. After tracking a speed- ing car, Mark flew the ‘copter north, passing to the east of the New Smyrna airport. Meanwhile, the co-pilot, who sat on the left side of the helicopter, was oper- ating the “forward looking infrared” (flir) imaging system that had been installed on the helicopter. The flir images were automatically recorded on VHS tape. After flying northward, Mark turned the helicopter around and flew southward past the airport. Jim pointed the flir to the right (toward the west) and recorded images of the small, private aircraft that were parked along the runway near the airport buildings. The videotape shows clear images of the buildings and airplanes on the ground because these objects were at tempera- tures different from the temperature of the ground. Then he began to write in his log book about the operation they had just com- pleted, and he was no longer controlling the pointing direction of the flir. Its point- ing direction subsequently drifted up- ward. UFO detected by thermal imager At this time the helicopter was at an altitude of about 500 ft and traveling at about 70 mph. Mark and Jim had just passed the airport when Mark first no- ticed “it.” Mark, sitting in the right side seat, was looking to his left and happened to glance at the flir viewing screen, which was mounted at the left side in front of Jim. He saw a strangely-shaped black image on the uniformly whitish viewing screen. His immediate impression was that the flir was showing the lights from some island in the ocean to his left, off the east coast of Florida. He started looking through the left window for visual con- firmation of the object and at the same time he alerted the co-pilot to the pres- ence of the image. The co-pilot looked and immediately noticed that the direction cursors, which show the horizontal and vertical pointing directions of the flir, had drifted away from the previous setting. They indi- cated that the flir was not pointing to- ward the left, but rather far to the right and upward. (The electronic display cursors on the screen indicate that it was pointing about 120 deg to the right and upward at an angle of about 28 deg.) He told Mark that it was at the right side, and they both immediately turned their attention to the right side of the he- licopter. Because of the proximity to the airport, Mark’s immediate assumption was that the unexpected object was an airplane about to land. Because he was sitting at the right side of the helicopter, he had an excel- lent view of the night sky to the right, so he looked carefully, but saw nothing. Jim, who was closer to the viewing screen than Mark, realized that the shape of the object was not consistent with any aircraft such as he had seen at other times on the flir screen. Then Jim started to turn the flir point- ing control in order to center the object, Maccabee"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":" January 2007 4 MUFON UFO Journal which was now drifting upward and to the right on the screen. At about the same time, Mark decided to turn the helicopter to the right to head toward the object which, according to the flir, was still at the right side and at some altitude above the helicopter. Unfortunately the tilting (banking) of the aircraft to the right during the turn caused the flir pointing direction to ro- tate downward. Jim tried to reaquire the object, and went through a quick search to do so (the flir pointing direction oscillated up and down), but it was gone, or at least was no longer within the field of view of the flir. Probably the banking of the helicop- ter during the right turn caused the flir sighting line to tilt downward so far that he could no longer rotate the flir upward enough to view the object. For his own amusement, Mark had made a habit of copying the flir video- tapes of the law enforcement operations in which he had participated, so he made a copy of the original videotape of this night’s operations, which included the video of the unusual object. (Note: he made a VHS copy of the original using the “standard play” option, which means that the image resolution is about as good as one could expect for a copy of the original tape (which was taped over many years ago.) Occasionally over the years he would show the video of this particular object to someone who seemed interested, but aside from this he didn’t talk about it. Fortunately, within the past year he showed it to a MUFON member (Steve Alexander) who subsequently alerted me. Mark provided me with his video copy for analysis, and both he and Jim provided whatever supporting informa- tion they could. Analysis The thermal imager was a FLIR Sys- tems, Inc. Model 2000AB, 8-14 mi- cron device with a sensitivity of 0.2 C, which corresponds to the smallest grey level change (brightness change) that it is obvious to someone looking at the video monitor. More modern flir systems can detect temperature differences smaller than 0.1 C. Unfortunately, according to a FLIR Systems engineer who is familiar with the 2000AB, this flir device had no ab- solute radiometric calibration, so one can- not determine the actual temperature of an object simply by looking at the bright- ness of its image on the viewing screen. The 2000 AB had an automatic gain control system. The automatic system adjusted the video so that the coolest por- tion of the scene was white (or black) and the hottest was black (or white). (The operator had the choice of “black hot” or “white hot.” Jim had chosen “black hot.”) The temperature difference between “hot” and “cold” could be 2 degrees or more. What one sees in this video are images of cold objects and the sky ap- pearing white, and images of warmer objects appearing with varying shades of grey to completely dark. The only controls available to the op- erator (other than pointing) were the brightness and contrast of the video screen. The video supplied by Mark also shows several other nighttime police operations that are unrelated to the UFO sighting, but which are instructive be- cause they illustrate the imaging capa- bility this device. One night the police were looking for a man in the woods. The bodies of the police are easily seen at night against a more or less uniform whitish or grey background (the cool ground) and shrub- bery or palmetto. There are ten distinc- tive grey levels ranging from completely white to completely black. These span the range of temperatures set by the automatic gain control. Be- cause the bodies of the policemen are as dark as any other hot objects, such as the engine compartments of the cars, it appears that the temperature range from black to white is rather small. The exact range cannot be deter- mined, but is approximately the tempera- ture of the human body (about 37 C), which appears as black, to the tempera- ture of the land itself, which could be perhaps 30 C (this is a guess). Also included among the images is a picture of a bird that happened to fly past the helicopter. In the single frame the image looks only marginally like a bird, but when the video is run, the flapping of wings is (barely) apparent. The single frame does show that a Screen showing object 59 frames from the beginning, or about two sec- onds after the object appeared at the upper right of the field of view. One of the helicopter blades is at the top of the screen."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"      5 MUFON UFO Journal January 2007 bird is a “hot” object when seen against the cold sky. The bird passed through the field of view in less than a second, unlike the unidentified object, which ap- peared for about 43 seconds. The video frame on the previous page shows the flir view at 59 frames, or nearly two seconds after the object ap- peared at the upper right of the field of view. This frame shows, at the very top, an image of a helicopter blade that was momentarily “stopped” by the short time it took for the camera to scan the scene. The blade was actually moving for- ward (to the left in the picture) at a high rate of speed (at a rotor rate of about 500 rpm the end of the blade moves at a speed of about 870 ft/sec). The jaggedness of the edges of the helicopter blade image is an artifact of the flir electronics. The angle of eleva- tion of the end of the rotor blade can be determined by using the specified field of view of the flir and the indication of the elevation cursor (at the right side). The vertical field of view is (top to bottom of the picture) given as 15 de- grees. Measuring from the center of the field of view (the center of the rectan- gular box) upward to the blade shows that the blade image is about 4 degrees above the center. The elevation cursor at the right indi- cates that the center of the field of view was 27-28 degrees above horizontal (the cursor is just below the 30 degree mark), so the end of the blade was at an up- ward tilt of 31 to 32 degrees. The angular elevation of the unidenti- fied object below and to the right of the blade was about 30 degrees. The angu- lar size of the unidentified object can be calculated from the number of image pixels across the image multiplied by the angle subtended by each (square) pixel. The 15-degree field of view is spanned by about 350 pixels (vertical measure), which corresponds to 0.043 degree/pix or 0.00075 radian/pixel (57.3 degrees = 1 radian). This vertical angle calibration also applies to the horizontal direction. The overall angular length of the uni- dentified image, which is about 22 pixels from left to right, is 22 x .00075 rad/pix = .0165 radians. The use of radian measure rather than degrees for small angles is conve- nient since the size of an object–as mea- sured transverse to the line of sight–can be calculated by multiplying the angular size in radians by the distance."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":" January 2007 6 MUFON UFO Journal Hence, if it had been at a distance of 100 ft its size (as measured perpendicu- lar to the direction of the line of sight) would have been about 1.65 ft, and if at 1,000 ft its size would have been about 16.5 ft, with other calculated lengths being proportional to other assumed distances. Of particular importance is the fact that the rotor blades blocked the view of the object several times as it moved downward from the upper right. Since the helicopter was flying level at this time, this means that the object was higher than the helicopter. Unfor- tunately there is no way to know how much higher since there is no way of knowing its distance. When its angular elevation was about 30 degrees, its height above the helicop- ter was approximately D sin(30) = 0.5D, where D is the assumed radial distance (distance along the line of sight) to the object. For example, if it had been 100 ft away it was about 50 ft above the heli- copter, and if 1,000 ft away it was about 500 ft above the helicopter, with other elevations being proportional to the as- sumed distance. After it appeared in the upper right of the field of view it drifted toward the center. The positions of the object in the field of view tell us something about the dynamics of the object. During this time, before Mark noticed the image on the flir screen, the helicop- ter was flying along a straight line with essentially no tilt. Jim was writing in his notebook. Hence the flir was pointing in a con- stant direction, upward and to the right, relative to the earth. The object appeared at the upper right and drifted downward and to the left, toward the center in an “ambling” way (not a direct descent but down and up and down), finally reach- ing the approximate center of the field of view. This means that not only was it drop- ping downward slowly in a seemingly controlled way (it didn’t just fall down- ward), it also must have been traveling at an average horizontal speed that was slightly greater than that of the helicop- ter. At the end of the sighting it was lost moving quickly upward and downward and upward and to the right. These rapid motions were probably a result of the effort of the flir operator to keep the flir pointed toward this invisible (to the na- ked eye) object while the pilot initiated a right turn to head toward it. Discussion The composite picture on the previ- ous page, made up of portions of video frames, shows the unusual image at vari- ous times. It has a strange shape, simi- lar to two “almost-spheres,” the larger at the left (front) and the smaller at the right, that are connected by a rod or something, like an asymmetric dumbell The front sphere is “hot,” although its actual temperature cannot be deter- mined. The rear “sphere” has elongated hot spots or hot, short “lines” separated by cold areas or lines. In most frames it appears as if two hot spots are visible in the rear sphere, but in some frames there appears to be three hot spots. The variation in num- ber may have something to do with what appears to be “rotation” about the long axis (unsynchronized with the scanning rate). Some jaggedness of the edge of the image of the leading “sphere” is an arti- fact of the device used to create the origi- nal picture (“pixilation” caused by the CCD; the same sort of jaggedness oc- curs along the edges of the images of the propeller blades). The hot spot images of the rear sphere may also be affected by the scan- ning, but it is my studied opinion that the appearance of several hot spots, one above the other, in the rear sphere is a real attribute of the object and not just a result of the scanning. Since the image resolution depends upon the spacing between scan lines, it may be that the sizes or thicknesses of the hot spot images are determined by the thickness of the scan lines. However one looks at it, the image shape is strange. It certainly does not resemble a bird (flying at a speed ex- ceeding 60 mph), and there were no air- planes nearby at that time, according to the witnesses. Also, it doesn’t look the way an air- plane appears in flir video. While looking at this video after the flight, Mark thought of a blimp flying south at a low altitude, but there was no blimp either. It would have been clearly imaged, and its headlights and running lights would have been seen visually af- ter the helicopter turned to the right. It certainly doesn’t look like the moon. It does look crudely like a helicopter if the rear “sphere” is assumed to be a ro- tation-blurred image of the tail rotor. However, the failure of Mark and Jim to see the running lights of any aircraft suggests that this hypothetical helicop- ter would have been flying without the required lighting, a fact that argues against the helicopter hypothesis. Of more importance is the fact that both Mark and Jim say they have seen the flir images of various types of air- craft, including helicopters, and these im- ages resemble the actual shapes of the aircraft and, furthermore, show the hot spots, such as the engines. Mark wrote: “I’ve FLIR’d other he- licopters and airplanes from close to far away (or at least my partners have while I watched). There is always a “strobing” effect from propellers and rotor blades, and heat from the exhaust is always evi- dent, and the basic nose area and cabin windows look as grey in flight as they do on the ground.” Thus, had it been a helicopter, the main “sphere” image would not have been a uniform black. The blackest por- tion would have been the top of the larger “sphere” near the engine (probably with an exhaust trail of heated air), and the rest of the “sphere” would have been a shade of grey. Jim wrote, “If an aircraft appears on the flir monitor it will outline the object, giving the shape that the observer [would see in the daytime], but will distinguish the hotter spots, i.e. the engine, gear box area, rotor blades or the tips of the props.” Thus it appears that the object was not another helicopter. One further possibility should be kept it mind: the shape of the image may not be the complete shape of the actual ob- ject: it may only be the shape of the hot regions. That is, if the main body of a “craft” was cold, i.e., at or below the tempera-"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"      7 MUFON UFO Journal January 2007 ture of the ambient air, while some por- tions were relatively hot (which does not mean excessive heat; in this case per- haps only 10 or more degrees above the ambient temperature), only the hot por- tions would be seen on the video. It is unfortunate that the flir provides little information on the actual tempera- ture of the object. It’s image is just as dark (black) as the propeller blades which themselves are black. What temperature might they have been? The blades were probably sev- eral degrees above the ambient air tem- perature as a result of air friction as they rotated. But even knowing the tempera- ture of the blades wouldn’t tell us much other than that the object was likely warmer than the blade. Conclusion This object, whatever it was, wasn’t traveling very fast (but at least as fast as the helicopter), but was traveling at night without emitting any visible light. Whether or not it would have been visible during the day by sunlight reflec- tion and silhouetted against the bright sky background is, of course, not known. As noted, there is also the possibility that the flir showed only the heated parts of a larger object; there might have been cooler parts, at the temperature of the air, which simply did not register on the flir. UFO investigators have in the past considered the possibility that strange objects are traveling through the atmo- sphere without being seen. Perhaps they are not seen because they travel too fast (although occasion- ally their images may be accidentally captured by ordinary cameras or videos). Perhaps they are not seen at night be- cause they emit light (radiation) only at wavelengths not detectable by the eye. Perhaps this is an example of such an object, one that was traveling in a co- vert manner–not radiating visible light– not “expecting” to be detected by the occupants of the helicopter, but the pres- ence of which was “given away” by the small (unavoidable?) amount of heat it radiated. (Note: many years ago Trevor Con- stable claimed to have photographed “critters” in the sky using infra-red film, which is sensitive to radiation in the wave- length range 0.8–0.9 microns, i.e., 1/10 th of the wavelength that the flir detects. The video discussed here should not be considered as a confirmation of Constable’s claims, since the physics of the detection system, film vs flir, are quite different.) This is not the first report of a dumb- bell-shaped object, although it is the first report of one being detected at night us- ing infrared imaging.

On Oct. 11, 2006, a dead cow was discovered on the Peterson ranch near Valier, MT, bearing the usual marks of bovine incisions, including missing udder, left ear, eyeball, and tissue around the eye, jaw, and tongue. There was a cir- cular cut in the rectal and vaginal region. Predators reportedly left the animal alone. However, in this case there was more–an indentation some four to five feet from the cow that suggested it had hit the ground at that point and then bounced to its final resting place, accord- ing to Sheriff Tom Kuka. Visual evidence that “mutilated” ani- mals have been dropped from above has been found at other bovine incision sites, including such anomalies as broken tree limbs above (and sometimes under) an animal, and even the unnatural position of the animal’s body. In the recent Montana case, samples of the soil from the indented area and from beneath the animal, along with con- trol samples, were sent to biophysicist W. C. Levengood at Pinelandia Biophysi- cal Laboratory for analysis. Levengood, for those new to the field, was one of the pioneers in the analysis of crop circle plants and soils—work which has separated legitimate crop circles from those which are man made. Likewise, he has been on the cutting edge of the analysis of bovine incision sites, including the discovery of hemo- globin on some of the animals (see June, 2005, MUFON UFO Journal). In the Montana case his most impor- tant analysis involved the charge den- sity plasmas (CDP) in the soils at the site. Levengood discovered that the CDP level was high in the control sample soil away from the animal, but surprisingly low in the soil sample from the indented soil area. It was also lower than expected in the soil beneath the animal. “This was quite puzzling,” said Levengood. “I have been measuring CDP at bovine incision and crop circle sites for three years, and this was very unusual.” The anomaly got him excited enough to develop a hypothesis to explain the sheriff’s opinion that the animal had probably been dropped from a height, hit the ground (making the indentation), and then bounced to the spot where it was found. “My hypothesis,” said Levengood, “was that the impact of this 1300-pound animal being dropped from a consider- able height was enough to lower the nor- mal negative CDP of the soil where the animal struck the ground–more so at the indentation site, because it would have received the greatest force.” He adds, “This is based on ten years of study which showed that positive and Soil evidence suggests ‘mutilated’ cow was dropped from the air"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":" January 2007 8 MUFON UFO Journal By Patty Donahue MUFON Field Investigator On Dec. 3, 2006, my youngest daugh- ter, Jessica, was invited to spend the night at a friend’s house in Delta Town- ship, 12-15 miles away. We left our house at 5:33 PM. I know the time because I stopped and took some pics of the house with the Christmas lights on. The camera clock shows the last pic at 5:33 PM. As we headed south down Wacousta Road, there was still plenty of light out when I noticed this huge set of three brilliant white lights just under the clouds. They were spread out in a broad hori- zontal direction, yet you knew there was an object there. It was in a blue sky with clouds above it. I instantly knew it was way too big to be an airplane. It was maybe three miles west of us, and huge. I said something to the girls, as I still saw it as we approached Grand River. We all watched it for just a few sec- onds, then I turned east onto Grand River, and we all noticed the object was gone from the western sky. It was so huge and bright it could not have just disappeared. However, I then noticed there was this gold/white light in the sky, and that it was moving. The sky was still blue and light enough, and we saw planes passing near this “light” that was still moving along with us. As I drove to the westbound Saginaw Hwy. exit, we all noticed it was now passing to the south of us. As I took the exit ramp, I had to turn west onto Saginaw Hwy. (M-43). At the end of the exit ramp, as we waited at the stop sign for traffic to clear, we all watched this object just sitting there. You could tell there was some sort of actual object there. Then amazingly, as we turned onto Saginaw Highway it too turned and headed west. It was defi- nitely moving along with us. Again, we saw other aircraft pass by this object. As we drove, the object was still fol- lowing us. As we pulled into her friend’s driveway, we saw it above us. We then got out, and there was this gold/white in the sky. As we unloaded Jessica’s stuff out of the truck, we looked up and could no longer see it. As Jen & I left Jessica’s friend’s house, we headed home, and it seemed to keep following us, so I tried to find a place to pull over. I pulled into the Flying J Truckstop, and I got out of my truck, to watch the gold/white object. Now it was a tiny bit north of us, almost overhead. I was standing right outside my driver door looking around and Jen was in the front passenger seat when all of a sud- den I saw these bright lights out of the corner of my eye. I turned directly east, and this huge object appeared out of nowhere just east of the I-96 overpass. It was huge, no more than 20 degrees off the horizon, but right there in front of us. It got closer and lower. It now was maybe 4-6 stories above the ground, and passing to the front (south) of the Fire Dept, coming towards us. It was as big as a jumbo 747, or bigger. It was over the Fire Dept parking lot. It had three bright white lights, and it was a triangle. Jen stuck her head out and then pulled half her body out onto the window frame and said, “Mom, it’s another triangle.” I said, “I know!” She got the camera out and reached across the front seat as I leaned into my truck to get it from her. I did not take my eyes off that triangle at all. There was absolutely no sound. It had three white lights on each cor- ner, a huge centered red portal, and a red light between two of the white lights. Then, as it banked to head back east again, it began blinking red & white lights. It went in a quick pattern, such as left to right, white-red-white, then back again, only from the right this time, white- red-white. I tried to take a picture, but it would not let my camera zoom in at all; it just froze. Then it finally zoomed in, and it would not let me focus. I took one picture that turned out crummy, so then I switched it to video mode, and once again tried to get the zoom to zoom in. It wouldn’t, so I just pressed record and started recording the best I could. Then it moved away from us, still east, ever so slightly northeast. After it was out of sight, we looked up, and that gold object was gone. Object follows car prior to close sighting negative CDP can be affected by stress and impact.” Levengood explained that the CDP pulses are due to “very specific cluster- ing, as well as the organization of spe- cific molecular isomers in the matrix of the water molecules in whatever you are studying. In this case I was studying soil. Nor- mal silicate-type soils have a negative charge on the little sand grains and crys- tals.” In order to test his hypothesis, Levengood constructed a flexible con- tainer in which he placed the soil to be analyzed, with charge collector plates on all four sides of the soil. Using a pendulum device, he did a series of controlled impacts on the soil, measuring the results, which showed that impacting the soil did lower the CDP energy level, thus agreeing with his hy- pothesis. Thus we have one more piece of sci- entific research to add to the evidence surrounding bovine incision sites–and one more item for Field Investigators to be aware of in analyzing these sites. W. C.

This and other presentations grew out of more than 25 years of work with a team that developed the speci- fications for one of our nation’s top spy satellites. During this time he was fre- quently called on to assist govern- ment specialists in their evaluations of various highly classified pro- grams. In the mid 1980’s Regehr’s in- volvement in these classified pro- grams convinced him that the gov- ernment was withholding the truth about UFOs. He has dedicated the past 20 years to lifting this veil of secrecy, compiling hundreds of Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) documents, interviews with key individuals, and extensive information on one highly sensitive spy satellite. Regehr has been the subject of– and author of–numerous articles since he first became interested in the UFO phenomenon in the 1950’s. About the author By Ronald S. Regehr Co-State Director, MUFON Utah Part Two: Cedar Breaks, UT alleged crash/retrieval The Cedar Breaks crash/retrieval is the second Utah case Linda Moulton Howe reports on www.earthfiles.com. According to Linda, a Michigan truck owner/operator provided her with infor- mation he knew of Area 51. This man, Paul, recounts his father’s radar engineering career that began at Hill AFB, UT, moved to Jackass Flats, NV, and then moved to Cedar Breaks, UT, where his father designed, built, and installed a new military radar facility. Paul then presents an incredible se- ries of events of aliens, alien technology, and a crashed UFO–all this, he claimed, from his personally witnessing these events when he was a 5 (or 7) year-old. I don’t know if Paul is totally wrong, or if he intentionally lied; his story bears the stamp of youthful confusion and pa- rental adoration. Relying on a single source is fraught with trouble. In this instance there is nothing to support these allegations. There is no other witness, there is no USAF radar station, and there is noth- ing to substantiate the 42-year-old memory of an anonymous caller. Because of the paucity of evidence, I haven’t spent the time required to fully investigate this case. My comments are based on my preliminary observations. The following is based on Linda Moulton Howe’s interview of Paul, a truck owner/operator currently living in Michigan. Howe quotes Paul: “... we were living in Las Vegas, Nevada, because my dad worked at Jackass Flats [which] was Area 51.” Jackass Flats is located in Area 25 of the Nevada Test Site, adjacent to Mer- cury, NV, about 70 miles northeast of Las Vegas. Area 51, located at Groom Lake, is roughly 40 air miles northeast of Jack- ass Flats, with several sets of mountains between the two locations. There is no road connecting Jackass Flats with Area 51 (or anywhere nearby). Access to Jackass Flats is via public roads. Access to Groom Lake/Area 51 is from Las Vegas via a bus with blacked-out windows or by a secure flight from McCarran Field. Paul’s fa- ther probably did work at Jackass Flats, but not Area 51. Howe quotes Paul: “... [at] Jack- ass Flats, where he finished his gov- ernment schooling and crash investi- gator schooling. I got to go to the of- fice ... which was at Jackass Flats.” I don’t remember seeing any train- ing facilities or radar installations dur- ing my brief tenure at Jackass Flats. Jackass Flats was the site used for ground tests of reactors, engines, and rocket stages as part of a program to develop nuclear reactors for use in the nation’s space program. In the early 1960s, the Atomic Energy Commission and the National Aeronau- tics and Space Administration managed a test area at the NTS, designated as the Nuclear Rocket Development Sta- tion. Here was where Aerojet, my em- ployer, tested their Nuclear Engine for Rocket Vehicle Application (NERVA). Although highly successful, NERVA was cancelled by President Nixon in 1973. Except for the Yucca Mountain por- tion of Jackass Flats, Area 25 is almost abandoned. The Yucca Mountain com- plex is in the news again as the conten- tious preliminary selection site for a nuclear waste depository Howe quotes Paul: “ What I re- member is after school, my Dad was transferred to Cedar City, Utah, where he was one of the radar techs at Cedar Breaks Radar, up on top of a tall mountain ... I went to work with my Dad on average twice a month for the 24 to 36 hour shift he had to pull as a radar tech.” There is a radar facility at Cedar Breaks, UT, on Blow Hard Mountain (37.60°N, 112.87°W). Two of them, as a matter of fact. There is a Federal Aviation Adminis- tration (FAA) radar station adjacent to the National Weather Service (NWS) radar station, and some maintenance is shared by the FAA and the NWS fore- cast office electronic technicians. But there is not now, nor has there ever been, a USAF radar facility on or near Cedar Breaks, UT. Either Paul’s recall of his father working at a USAF"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":" January 2007 10 MUFON UFO Journal radar facility at Cedar Breaks is wrong or his father was a civilian. Blow Hard Mountain, with its eleva- tion of 10,714 feet, is snowed in often. Under best travel conditions, the one- way trip takes five hours; under worst conditions, the trip averages seven hours, and the final few hundred yards often must be traversed on snow shoes. Because of the distances traveled, personnel frequently work 8-hour shifts on site for several days. This might ac- count for the “24-to-36-hour shift” memory. Howe quotes Paul: “ One of the very first instances I can remember was the radar site at that time ran at an average of 3 megawatts, that’s 3 million watts. It was time for an upgrade...from tubes to transistors Paul claims 3 MW for the old (tube) radar and 10 MW for the new (transis- tor) radar. This makes no sense, as the power rating is grossly overstated. The primary FAA Air Traffic Con- trol radar, with coverage from Canada to Mexico, Atlantic to Mississippi River, operates on 50 kW–roughly 1/20 the asserted power. The Naval Research Laboratory’s new “High-Power” radar, WARLOC, operates on 80 kW (peak) and 10kW (av- erage). Nowhere near a megawatt. Howe quotes Paul: “As a kid, I used to play [with operating radar units!? ]... We could run the square [cursor] around the radar site [screen?] and put it on any object... X, Y, or O. ... X was military air- craft, Y were commercial ... When something was unknown ... it would flash X.” Paul plainly states that the “un- knowns” were military aircraft, not UFOs. When Air Force “Red Flag” air- craft are engaged in some classified ex- ercises, they will turn off their transpon- ders, resulting in no positional data being transmitted, making them true “un- knowns.” It is incredible to believe a young child was not only granted access to what would have been a secure facility, and that this same child was allowed to “play with” the equipment, and then provided with what would have been highly clas- sified information–the existence of UFOs! Howe: [On page 2 of her Earthfiles file] “In 1966, when Paul was seven years old, [emphasis added] the fam- ily moved again to Cedar City, Utah.” This conflicts with Paul’s statement on page 4: “One thing I can really remember while playing with it and it was just shortly before I turned 6- years-old.[emphasis added]” We now have either a 5-year-old or a 7-year-old who “really remembers” play- ing with this complicated and potentially dangerous equipment. Howe quotes Paul: “They [E.T.s] used to play with us ... above a radar site there is a dead zone ... and the UFOs used to stack up on top of the radar site and just sit there.” Again, I find my credulity stretched. Not too many 5-year-olds know of a ra- dar “dead zone”! Not too many 5-year- olds can even say “megawatt” let alone have an idea of its meaning. And not too many 5-year-olds are allowed access to classified material such as UFOs. Howe quotes Paul: “I was able to sit at one of the three consoles [the main console] ... Dad, what’s this? ... I don’t know, it’s flashing ... At that moment we had a huge explosion. I ran outside ... it looked like smoke and steam ... two discs sitting directly above the dead zone ... They are flashing ... different colors ...” A five-year-old sitting at a function- ing, main console of a classified, opera- tional radar site? Again, the implica- tion is that a UFO started “flashing.” What does flashing mean? Were they (the UFOs) alternating between reflecting and not reflecting radar? This doesn’t make sense either, as Paul claims they are in the “dead zone.” So what was flashing? Howe quotes Paul: “My dad, be- ing how he was a lead [emphasis added] investigator ... Dad was sit- ting at a desk with all this mangled ... stuff ... He was picking out this hair-like stuff. [Paul asked] Dad, what is this? [Dad] Son, this is E.T.’s chest.” First his father was a radar tech stu- dent, then a designer of a new-technol- ogy (tube-to-transistor) radar system, then he was responsible for the radar installation, then the radar system test and checkout, and finally, he’s the lead investigator performing a pathological examination of the remains of an alien corpse? Paul elaborates further, with equal vigor, as he attempts to dazzle the reader with his Mach 4 UFOs, disassembly of a destroyed UFO console, and a “small ball of spinning matter” he calls the Ron Regehr Linda Moulton Howe"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"      11 MUFON UFO Journal January 2007 “heart.” Howe: “Is it possible that our gov- ernment was in a hostile relationship to the disc ... [and] tried to bring [them] down to study?’ How would a 5-year-old know the government’s intentions? Yet, un- daunted, Paul continues, “ That was the only reason, as I understood, that they used to shoot at them.” Howe quotes Paul: “I used to sit there and play with the computer [sic] finding out who all of them were.” Let me see if I understand. Here’s this very precocious 5-year-old, still granted access to a government facility, sitting at a functioning radar console and successfully determining where all the UFOs were. Howe quotes Paul: “...all of the equipment that came was from Jack- ass Flats. It’s all marked as such. ... every crane, every single truck, ev- ery single car came from Jackass Flats ... anybody who would try to tell me differently would be wrong.” I believe I adequately covered the Jackass Flats question before. But if Jackass Flats were a highly classified location they would not splash their iden- tity on “all the equipment.” Remember, the USAF denied even the existence of Area 51 until recently–and then only as a result of a lawsuit. Howe: “What ... was the physical appearance of whatever the intelli- gence was inside the discs?” Paul, as we now have come to real- ize, is a precocious 5-year-old, blessed with an eidetic memory, then relates the physical attributes of two types of aliens he saw. Howe: “Did your father ever have a face-to-face with the tall blondes in charge? Paul replies: He told me, and al- ways told me, that when he went to ‘school’ that all of the information came from these tall, blond-headed men ... The information that he was given in redesigning the electronics for that (Utah)” Howe quotes Paul: “My Dad is the designer of transistors.” Bardeen and Brattain, working for Dr. Shockley at Bell Labs, designed and built the first transistor on Dec. 16, 1947. Howe: “Were the transistors your Dad was designing based specifically on the [alien] technology? Paul answers: “Absolutely. Based all on crystal technology because a transistor is nothing more than hum- ming crystal.” I’ll admit it–a crystal transistor is to- tally alien technology. Where I come from–i.e. Earth–transistors are not crys- tal, but composed of semiconductor crys- talline-matrix materials such as Germa- nium or Silicon. A “humming crystal” would, if anything, be an oscillator. Based on the above, I believe Paul’s story cannot be substantiated..

In an attempt to end the turf wars that come with planning a city-wide event during the week of July 4, the City of Roswell will coordinate the 2007 UFO Festival July 6-8. The 2007 event marks the 60th anni- versary of the Roswell Incident and the 10-year anniversary of the festival itself. Jack Swickard, president of the In- ternational UFO Museum and Research Center Board of Directors, said the board is happy about the city’s decision to take over the festival. “It has been our hope at the museum that the city would take command of the festival,” said Swickard. “We met with (Mayor Sam LaGrone) right after this year’s festival and he indicated that he wanted to get involved.” Lawyer available for German abductees BERLIN, Germany (Reuters)–A German lawyer hopes to drum up more business by pursuing state compensa- tion claims for people who believe they were abducted by aliens. “There’s quite obviously a demand for legal advice here,” Jens Lorek told Reuters by telephone. “The trouble is, people are afraid of making fools of themselves in court.” Lorek, a lawyer based in the eastern city of Dresden who specializes in so- cial and labor law, said he hoped to expand his client base by taking on the unusual work. He has yet to win any abduction claims, but says there are plenty of po- tential clients, noting that extra-terres- trial watchdogs report scores of alien assaults every year. “These people could appeal for therapies or cures,” he said. Lorek, 41, is pinning his hopes for success on a German law which grants kidnap vic- tims the right to state compensation. He said he was not worried he might look ridiculous by seeking justice for cli- ents dealing with aliens.

Reviewed by Dwight Connelly MUFON UFO Journal editor This latest publication from the Cen- ter for UFO Studies (CUFOS) is, like its predecessors, filled with articles on vari- ous parts of the UFO phenomenon, pre- sented as formal scientific studies. Abduction experiences Stephanie Kelley-Romano of Bates College offers “A Report on the Demo- graphics and Beliefs of Alien Abduction Experiences.” Most of her findings are not surpris- ing: i.e. the majority of experiencers be- lieve they were first abducted as chil- dren, they report repeat encounters, and they believe the experience involves their families. Her study also indicted that it was common for experiencers to believe they possess psychic abilities, have the power to heal, and have lived past lives. They generally see the experience as positive. I was surprised that her studies did not mention the abduction transcription project compiled by Dan Wright in the 1990’s, although several other studies were noted. Her project was flawed from the be- ginning, due to the method by which the 130 participants were selected. This in- volved recruiting volunteer subjects via the Internet–hardly a random sample, and with few controls. Thus her conclusions have little substance. Sightings and memories The second article is “The Effect of the Label ‘UFO’ on Memory for Am- biguous Pictorial Stimuli” by J. Steiner and Anthony L. Jinks of the School of Psychology at the University of West- ern Sydney (Australia). This study involved 40 undergraduate psychology students who drew from memory ambiguous pictures recalled under four label conditions: UFO, air- plane, ambiguous, and self-derived. The study showed no significant dif- ference among the label and control con- ditions on either measures of detail or the addition of features, and found that, in a controlled environment, perceptual set does not affect accuracy of recall of previously witnessed ambiguous pic- tures. This suggests that a witness to a UFO sighting will be as accurate in describing details as a witness to the sighting of an airplane. However, the emotional factor present in a real UFO sighting was not part of this controlled experiment. Photo analysis In the third article, well-known re- searcher Richard F. Haines presents “An Analysis of Multiple UAP Photographic Images” (taken May 23, 1971, in the Austrian Alps). This is a detailed study of 11 consecu- tive color photos and eyewitness testi- mony of an alleged unidentified aerial phenomenon (UAP) taken over a 10- minute period. Haines concludes that the photos are, in fact, of an unidentified “blunt-cornered isosceles triangle with flat bottom and convex upper surface.” The series of 11 photos is included with the article. Shuttle UFOs In the fourth article, Lan D. Fleming of Muniz Engineering, Houston, TX, does an analysis of the images of several objects moving through space, as cap- tured by video on the STS-48 mission of Sept 15, 1991. These were explained by NASA as shuttle-generated debris particles, but Fleming’s detailed study suggests that the movement of the particles rules out NASA’s explanation. Angel hair In the fifth article, Brian Boldman, who is familiar to MUFON Journal readers, provides a detailed description and analysis of the angel hair phenom- enon. This is followed by an analysis of an- gel hair samples by Phyllis Budinger, who is also familiar to MUFON Journal readers. Book review Also included in this issue is a review of the book Life’s Solution: Inevitable Humans in a Lonely Universe by Simon Conway Morris.

Box 1429, Colum- bus, NC 28722, 6x9, soft cover, 236 pages, $24.00. Reviewed by Dwight Connelly MUFON UFO Journal editor As I recall, I first heard of Jim Sparks (born Vincent Sparacino) when I read Linda Moulton Howe’s book, Glimpses of Other Realities, Volume II: High Strangeness (Paper Chase Press, 1998), where she devotes a long and profusely illustrated chapter to his claims. Sparks’account stuck in my mind be- cause of two somewhat unusual twists to the usual contactee/experiencer ac- count. First, he claims to have been forced by his alien captors to learn a compli- cated alphabet, apparently in order to communicate on some higher level. And second, he claims to recall just about all of his numerous contacts with the aliens without the aid of hypnosis. Thus his story is more in the realm of the typical contactee, rather than the typi- cal experiencer. With no record of hypnosis (whatever A contactee’s story New CUFOS Journal"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"      13 MUFON UFO Journal January 2007 its shortcomings), and no independent witnesses, it is impossible to judge the validity of his account, although it ap- pears to be quite real to him. Despite enduring what Sparks refers to as “an alien boot camp” in trying to learn the complicated alien alphabet, the purpose of the alphabet has not been revealed. This symbol learning process is simi- lar to what Becky Andreasson was de- scribed as doing in Raymond Fowler’s book The Watchers II (Wild Flower Press, 1995). Sparks’ contacts have included mostly the common grays, but also the alien leaders, who eventually allowed them- selves to be seen. They are described as truly awesome: “Their upper bodies looked like foot- ball linebackers....They had scales, and their faces were sort of snakelike, or liz- ard-like....Their eyes were small like ours, but diamond shaped. The pupils were reddish. Their heads were big, and their brow stuck far out from their eyes to various degrees, giving them all some kind of individuality.” The subtitle of this book is “An Alien Message for the Human Race,” and naturally the reader is eager to discover what this message from these reptilian/ reptoid aliens might be. Here the uniqueness of Sparks’ ac- count ends, as the message is basically the familiar “your planet is dying.” This is hardly news from on high. The fact that our planet is in trouble is obvi- ous to anyone who has kept up with the numerous warnings regarding global warming, pollution, weapons of mass de- struction, etc. Sparks says he was told by the aliens that “there are better ways of deriving energy and food needs without causing your planet any damage. Those in power are aware of this and have the capabil- ity of putting these methods into world- wide use.” And why has this not been done? The aliens respond: “Those in power view it as a military and security threat.” And how can we overcome this re- luctance of our leaders to act? The alien answer: “Amnesty. Com- plete amnesty to those in power, gov- ernments and leaders who have been suppressing the truth. They can’t be held liable for any past wrong deeds. It is the only way these leaders can come for- ward with the truth. It is necessary that you do this in order to work together and survive.” The suggestion is that selected ordi- nary individuals, such as Sparks, are to spread the word and gently pressure world leaders to do what is necessary to save the planet. This scenario, which is so often described by experiencers/ contactees, is difficult for me to accept, as it makes no sense. Here we allegedly have government officials who have had contact with aliens–and who reportedly made and broke agreements with them–who now need to be forgiven for covering all of this up, and then be pressured to act. First, I simply cannot imagine govern- ment officials refusing to cooperate with an obviously superior alien race which is willing to provide the technology for saving the planet. This is supposedly true not only for our own government, but also for the leaders of other nations, such as China (definitely a top polluter, and moving rap- idly to become an even bigger polluter). And if past government officials were not cooperative, why not work on newly- elected officials? In fact, given the great power that aliens seem to possess, why didn’t they swing a few votes to envi- ronmentalist Al Gore in the 2004 elec- tion instead of allowing George Bush to be re-elected? It also makes no sense for the aliens to rely on ordinary citizens, such as Sparks, and suggest that he can some- how generate the public pressure nec- essary to convince our leaders to do the right thing. Why not Oprah Winfrey, whose mere mention of a particular book title can make it a best seller? Why not Peyton Manning or other sports heroes? Why not stars of the entertainment industry? To suggest that a Jim Sparks or a Dwight Connelly has the level of clout necessary to generate such pressure makes no sense, and if the aliens are that bad in judging who has influence, I have to wonder about everything else attrib- uted to them. But perhaps the “ordinary” human being becomes extraordinary as the re- sult of contact–at least in his or her own mind. Turning to other questions, Sparks says the aliens are creating alien-human hybrids so that “if we fail to turn our environment around and we die off, af- ter the dust settles they can repopulate the Earth with hybrids that could possi- bly be more adaptable to the Earth’s changed environment.” His understanding is that the aliens are using us to obtain what they need– whether it be raw materials or something else–so it is in their interest that we, or at least a human hybrid, survive. He suggests they have been interact- ing with us for thousands of years, and that they have been monitoring his own family bloodlines over this period of time. Sparks thinks the aliens may not be extraterrestrials, but travel from other dimensions, and he claims that his expe- rience with the aliens allows him to see other dimensions. Interestingly, during his abductions (he refers to the process as “pulled”), he has traveled “on board their craft,” which sounds more ET than interdimensional. In the end, he seems perplexed as to what the aliens are or where they come from. Sparks says he has had “several en- counters with people from the future,” and “as far as I can tell, they are any- where from a few hundred to several thousand years ahead of us.” He adds, “The types of people that come to me speak English and are from the good old USA. It’s comforting for me to know America still exists in the near and distant future.” This seems just a bit puzzling. Aren’t we talking throughout most of this book about saving the Earth, which is on the brink of destruction? This contact with U.S residents from the future suggests that the save-the- Earth effort will be successful–but are these people humans or alien-human hy- brids? Sparks’ writing is lively, conversa- tional, and interesting, but I would not put this book on the reference shelf."},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":" January 2007 14 MUFON UFO Journal George Filer Filers Files By George Filer Director, MUFON Eastern Region Note: These reports are presented in or- der to keep readers informed of some of the vast number of sightings being reported.

Colorado pilot describes UFO Denver — “While flying westbound at FL380 (38,000'),” says the witness, “my First Officer and I saw a very bright, white light at our 9 o’clock high position. “The object was just east of Denver at 11:15 PM, on Oct. 1, 2006, at what seemed to be 40 to 50 thousand feet and was moving north to northeast. “Four to five smaller lights appeared behind the main object at even spacing, and maintained the same altitude and speed as the lead object. “I asked Denver Center (Air Traffic Control) if they had traffic at my 9 o’clock high. They replied negative. I said, ‘maybe it’s space junk burning up,’ but another airliner on frequency said no, it was moving too horizontal and did not have a trail of burning debris. “I agreed. The lights went out as they moved off to the north and east. I’ve seen many meteors while flying, and this was not a meteor. It was not a conven- tional aircraft, as it had no position, strobe, or anti-collision lights. “I have 17,000+ hours of flying time over 40 years.

Colorado triangle makes passes Boulder — On Oct. 19, 2006, at 6:50 PM, a child and two adults were sitting in a hot tub on a cold partly cloudy night. The 10-year-old boy looks up, points, and screams, “What’s that!?” The adults looked, but didn’t see any- thing. The child said, “I just saw a UFO,” and he jumped out and ran inside, quite frightened. A few minutes later as the adults talked about how scared he looked, the child slowly comes back out. He was told, “Come back in. It was probably just a shooting star.” He points back up and says, “There it is!” and the adults all looked and saw a huge V-shaped tri- angle made up of reddish, dull, illu- minated sections flying north. It was flying low and silent and fast, about 1,000 feet up. Now the adults “were all in shock, and after a few minutes of staring at the sky, we all went inside in amazement.” The boy said when it first came by it was rounded in the front, not V-shaped, and had more lights and was flying lower.

Colorado object with halo Canon City — The witness reports, “I was driving from east to west on US Highway 50, going through the traffic light at the Home Depot, when I first spotted what appeared to be a very bright planet just above the southwest- ern horizon at 11:15 pm. I started watch- ing the white light because it got larger and brighter. “It seemed to be traveling from SW to NE across the sky. It became a bright light with an aura or halo around it. Then the bright light with aura had white streaks that appeared to shoot out the top of it. “As the object continued to get closer, the white streaks (trails of light) in the sky then appeared in SW to NE lines rather than appearing to shoot out the top of it. “When the phenomenon was nearly overhead, it appeared as 4, 5, or 6 dis- tinct, bright white lights, continuing on the SW to NE pathway. “At that point it had a halo or aura around it. The width of one side of the halo was approximately the width of the bright light at the center. “I also noticed at this point what looked like white fireworks shooting up from the circular object. Then as the object got closer it appeared to evolve into 5 or 6 bright lights, more or less in a straight line, which continued on the SW to NE path through the sky. “I was still driving and lost sight of the lights as they appeared to go over- head. The entire sighting lasted about one and one-half minutes.” Peter Davenport of the NUFORC notes: “I spoke with this witness on sev- eral occasions, and consider him to be a superlative witness.” Poland UFO upsets animals Aleksandria — P.P. from Czesto- chowa, recently shared details of his UFO sighting that took place in August, 1994, along with his grandfather. Aleksandria is a village with 2000 in- habitants located in the Silesian region. At about 9 PM the witnesses heard a commotion among the goats, poultry, and dogs outside their farm at dusk and de- cided to investigate. They spotted an unidentified craft re- sembling the Moon that remained vis- ible for a dozen minutes before disap- pearing. The object was round in shape, and emanated an orange-pinkish “warm”light as it flew straight.

I heard a slight humming noise above and behind me to the east. “I felt more than heard the hum, as it seemed to increase slightly, which caught my attention. Then the hairs on my arms and head started to rise like a static charge when you rub a balloon on your head. “I looked up to see what was going on. The hum was directly over my head, but when I looked up I did not see a craft or cloud or anything. What I did see was like a soap bubble. “The more I looked, I could make out that there were three triangular shapes which seemed to displace the air. It seemed like the triangles were reflect- ing or bending the light around them. “It was like looking at the sky through a soap bubble. The triangles were defi- nite, but only because the sky around them seemed to be bent or displaced. “The triangles were moving slowly in a westerly direction towards the Gulf for three minutes in a straight line in a V formation. “The static feeling seemed to increase in intensity as it got closer to me. It was very strong when directly over my head, and decreased gradually as they moved away from me. I am not really sure if it was a UFO, but it was something that I have never experienced before.” Thanks to Peter Davenport. Hawaii Disc Anahola — “For three hours on Oct. 21, 2006, beginning at 3 PM, my 8-year- old daughter and her friend had a sight- ing and interaction with a UFO in Ha- waii,” says the father. “The two girls were sleeping in our screen room and were awakened by a strong wind, and a loud crash. They saw what they think might have been a me- teor shower. Then they saw a hovering saucer with lights. “It made a huge mechanical noise like a public safety siren for awhile, then it stopped and finally left. Immediately a host of red multi-laser-like lights entered the room and focused on them. They said they were not able to touch themselves or each other; they heard themselves talk, but couldn’t hear the other person. “The light left, they felt induced to sleep, and woke up an hour or so later, bumping their heads. They saw lights on the mountain about a mile away, then flashing swirling lights in the adjacent sky. “These girls show no indication of a prank, or collusion. They both remem- ber having a vivid dream prior to being awakened the first time, then again the same dream during the brief sleep. “Different dreams, but both dreamed the identical dream twice. I believe my daughter’s story. She will not sleep by herself tonight. She insists on sleeping with her parents.” Thanks to Peter Davenport. California saucer with bright lights Cameron Park — The witness re- ports, “On Oct. 29, 2006, at 6:12 PM, driving north on Cameron Park Drive I saw a straight line of bright white lights ahead of me and thought it was a plane landing at the local airport. “As I approached I could see that it was hovering over someone’s back yard. As I was almost caught up with it, I could see that it had very bright col- ored lights surrounding the entire circu- lar edge of the craft, like really big Christ- mas lights with big bright yellow, green, blue, and red bulbs. I think those were all the colors. The craft had a circular shape in gen- eral, with pointed ends around it at each different colored light. I estimate that it was close to 17-25 feet in diameter. “It continued to hover for about a half- second, then moved seemingly parallel to the ground over my car and then onto the other side of the road. All the time I could see the circle of very big bright lights, and then it was gone. It made no noise. “I am a graduate nursing student. Never seen anything like this before.” ((NUFORC Note: We spoke with this witness, and we deem her to be an ex- ceptionally capable witness. Thanks to Peter Davenport, Director, www.ufocenter.com. Oregon balls of light Florence — “On Nov. 14, 2006,” explains the witness, “I was walking on the coast in a small town gated retire- ment community called Greentrees at 8:45 PM. “It was a clear night when out of the corner of my eye I saw an object that was very bright orange, like a welder’s arc in brightness, that looked like two great big balls of light, each about the size of the Moon. “I noticed some kind of structure, very dimly lit, between the balls of light. I fol- lowed it as it moved slowly and silently along, and was able to keep up with it until it got to my house. “I was so surprised and stunned at what I was seeing that I forgot to call my wife to come out. It went down our road until it got over the woods, and then circled back towards me! “It was only about three houses down when it then went up our back hill and off to the west. As I was watching it go west towards the ocean, it like blinked off and was gone. “I have become obsessed with find- ing out what this could have been. I also called our police about it, but that went nowhere. Our Coast Guard flies helicop- ters, but this was silent.” Thanks to MUFON http:// mufoncms.com. Illinois lights West Dundee — “On Dec. 2, 2006,” says the witness, “I went out in my back yard to let my dog out and to get fire- wood. I looked up at the sky and thought I saw a V-shaped flock of birds. “However, it seemed to stop moving from north to south, and when it moved from the west to the east it looked like 6 or 7 very faint orange or white lights, moving very evenly, evenly spaced, and very quiet. “My dog started barking wildly from the deck for no good reason. The object continued slowly moving east, and I lost sight of it over the tree line. “During the whole process my mind tried to rationalize what it could be, but nothing on this Earth came to mind with what the object was doing and looking like.”"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":" January 2007 16 MUFON UFO Journal Uganda sighting Kampala — Mahmoud E.

The bright lights became dimmer to- wards the rear. “The body of the object was shiny and silvered by the full Moon reflection. There were five bands of intense red light emerging from the central part of the spaceship towards the end, where they mixed with an enormous and intense red light that emerged from the rear hemisphere and which seemed to extend New Zealand disc North Island — Dean, from the Tauranga UFO Investigation Group, re- ports, “During the course of building our new web site, we uncovered many in- teresting and intriguing images, includ- ing this image of HMNZS Royalist re- turning from the 1965 Waitangi Day cel- ebrations.

Some striking points were observed at that moment, they were: 1. The bright light at the front was so bright, it looked like the light from elec- tric arc welding, the light was intense and near to ultra-violet radiation. 2. Each of the red colored beams were much more intense in their middle 3. Both the upper and lower beams that emerged from the center of the spaceship were clearly curved at the emerging center points, while the two beams which were above and below the center, were slightly curved at the emerging points. These curvatures are characteristic of that which can only be produced by a magnetic field. 4. No sound of any kind could be heard from the ship. 5. As the spaceship flew above some clouds in the northern part of the city, the red light was clearly seen reflecting and coming out from the surrounding clouds. 6. The spaceship then appeared in an opening between the clouds, then disap- peared. 7. The red light began fading away in the distant horizon. 8. My friend thought the length was more than 50 meters; my estimation is more than 100 meters. The diameter of the spaceship was around 25 meters Therefore, my conclusion was that what we had witnessed was an entry of a spaceship from a different world that was controlled by different intelligence.

The Appaloosa mare’s real name was Lady, but she was confused in much of the media with Snippy, her mother. “Snippy,” or “Snippy’s skeleton,” dropped out of sight for decades, only to supposedly surface recently on eBay with a minimum bid of $50,000. Frank Duran, a marketing specialist for Dell’s Insurance in Alamosa, said he posted “Snippy” on ebay after an attor- ney for a local man’s estate asked him to market the famed set of bones. But Duran later put the “Snippy” bid- ding on hold because the local chamber of commerce and a relative of Nellie Lewis, who owned the horse in 1967, have claimed ownership. “When I was a kid, I remember that Snippy was displayed at the chamber of commerce,” said Duran. “At some point, the chamber was going to throw her away,” he said, “and a guy, Herman Doty, took her with the dream of opening a museum. It didn’t happen.” In the mid-1970s, the Lewis family donated Snippy to the Luther Bean Mu- seum at Adams State College, where she was displayed until the 1980s, Duran said. From there, explained Duran, Snippy moved to the home of Carl Helfin, a lo- cal collector, who died in 2003, and the horse skeleton was part of his estate."},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":" January 2007 18 MUFON UFO Journal Perceptions By Stanton T. Friedman Stan Friedman Hard proof Three times in the past couple of months I have had skeptics demand that I provide Hard Proof that some UFOs are alien spacecraft. This is a strange request, because in my lectures I speak about overwhelm- ing evidence rather than Hard Proof. The terms are never well defined; presumably they want me to provide an alien body or pieces of a saucer that has been ana- lyzed and shown to have originated off the earth...because of their extraordinary composition or physical properties. How in the world could I obtain such items? Does any rational person believe that the government doesn’t have a very large concern with keeping such items classified? Think how different the evidential re- quirements are in different situations. A fingerprint or footprint might prove some- body was at a certain location. But it is not of much use if there is no finger or shoe to match. DNA is great if you have an appro- priate sample to compare it to. In gen- eral, one has to do the best one can with the available materials, whether it is solv- ing a murder, evaluating an airplane crash, or reviewing evidence about fly- ing saucers. We prove things in plane geometry and in measuring physical constants like the acceleration of gravity, the speed of sound in the air at a certain tempera- ture, and the solubility in a fluid of a solid such as sugar or salt. These things do not involve intelli- gence on the part of the item being stud- ied. But very often we infer things rather than provide hard evidence. Are there black holes? I know of no astronomer who has provided a piece of a black hole or actually seen one. It is not the nature of the situation for these tests to be met. We look for indirect evi- dence. In 1926 when pernicious anemia was invariably fatal, it was found that feed- ing liver to dogs could usually take care of the problem. Then it was determined that it worked in humans as well. It wasn’t until 1948 that it was dis- covered that it was the tiny amount of Vitamin B-12 in the liver that did the job. It took another 25 years to develop manufacturing techniques. The need is measured in millionths of a gram per day. B-12 includes a metal, cobalt, not usu- ally, in the past, thought of as having bio- logical significance Sailors were given limes to eat to pre- vent scurvy during long trips at sea. This was long before the discovery that it was vitamin C that did the job. Did liver and Vitamin C cure all cases of pernicious anemia or scurvy? No, just the great majority. There was evidence of effectiveness, but not HARD proof. Debunkers want a piece of a saucer certified by three test labs as being manufactured–and with isotope ratios not like similar materials found on earth. What if the elements had the same isotope ratios as elements mined here because they came from a planet in a nearby solar system? However, considering the potentially great significance of learning to dupli- cate the technology of such artifacts, why would anybody be surprised that the government would withhold such mate- rials? Do the doubting Thomases really be- lieve such materials should be paraded around in the market places of the world? There is no doubt that the allies and people in their countries during World War 2 would have been delighted to know that the German military codes had been broken. But revealing that secret would have caused them to be changed and would have cost many lives. For reasons which I don’t understand, the noisy negativists can’t seem to un- derstand that unexpected observations should not be expected to be precise or reproducible in the way of scientific ex- periments where one can control all the factors, such as the equipment being used, the duration of observation, the in- strumentation, etc. If a number of people are witnesses to the robbery of a bank, can one rea- sonably expect them to take pictures of the robbers, measure their height and weight, get their IDs? Of course not. Far better accuracy is required in the description of a bank robber than in the discussion of a UFO sighting. Height of 6’ plus or minus 20% isn’t much good (That is a range of 60 to 84 inches). But a round object hovering a few feet over the ground and about 30’ in diam- eter and taking off silently straight up at hundreds of miles an hour does not de- scribe any Earthly vehicle, even if it is really between 24 and 36 feet, is oval rather than round, is moving at 70 de- grees to the horizontal, is making a noise that might be heard by a dog and not by people, and is moving at 100-500 mph. Shouldn’t multiple witness radar-visual sightings count for a great deal, espe- cially if the comments are taped, say between an airline crew visually observ- ing a UFO out the window which matches what they see on their radar and which also is known via radio com- munication between them and the ground (FAA Air Traffic Control Center) to be appearing on ground radar? The JAL Flight 1628 case of Nov. 18, 1986, provides just such multiple sensor"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"      19 MUFON UFO Journal January 2007 inputs.(see Dr. Bruce Maccabee’s very comprehensive article at http:// brumac.8k.com/JAL1628/JL1628.html ). Interestingly the FAA person involved in gathering the ground and crew testi- mony, John Callahan (for 6 years the Division Chief of the Accidents and In- vestigations Branch of the FAA), claims that the information was taken from him by the CIA at a major briefing which included three CIA agents, three FBI agents, and other suits. Nothing was to be said. Fortunately, he for some reason wasn’t sworn to se- crecy as were the others. The brilliant skeptics who defend the non-existence of intelligently controlled alien spacecraft “identified” what was reported by the JAL and FAA crews as Jupiter and Mars–even though the de- scriptions indicate the object was twice the size of an aircraft carrier, even though normal air control radar cannot pick up signals from these planets, and even though these planets cannot circle around a 747 while being observed on radar and visually. Surely no such vehicle has ever been noted as part of the Air Force’s stable of planes. Another argument made by noisy negativists is that true scientific theories require falsifiability. We can certainly suggest tests which can be falsified: If aliens are really visiting Earth, then presumably they should be seen all over Earth, not just in the United States, right? Of course, and they are. If some UFOs are flying over or through our airspace, then surely they should be observed on radar, right? Right indeed, and they have been as detailed, for example, in Dr. James E. McDonald’s 1968 Congressional Testimony as noted on my website. If alien spacecraft are being observed, then surely there should be differences between them and IFOS, but as Carl Sagan said, “There are no interesting and reliable UFO sightings.” The facts clearly indicate the more reliable the sighting , the more likely to be unidentifiable by professionals seek- ing an explanation If there is no difference between IFOs and UFOs, than surely not only the bet- ter the quality of sighting reports, the less likely to be Unidentifiable, but a com- parison between the observable charac- teristics of the two groups should show that the UNKNOWNS are similar to the KNOWNS. Nope, the data show that the prob- ability that the UNKNOWNS are just missed knowns, based on six different observable characteristics, is less than 1%. The only reason sightings remain un- explained is that there is insufficient in- formation to validate any particular ex- planation. Wrong again. The poorer the quality of the sighting the less likely to be listed as an UN- KNOWN and the more likely to be listed as Insufficient Information, a separate category from UNKNOWN. If aliens were really violating Earth’s air space, surely they would land from time to time. I might just point out Ted Phillips’ 5,000 Physical Trace cases from 70 countries. Usually the observed ve- hicles are in the 30-40 foot diameter range. Surely no vehicle sophisticated enough to get here from Zeta Reticuli or elsewhere would crash in the boondocks near Roswell, NM. Considering all the reports of huge mother ships as observed in many coun- tries as well as in Alaska and the Yukon (0.6-1.2 miles long), it appears that huge mother ships are doing the long distance interstellar treks, whereas the smaller ones flit around the atmosphere. I haven’t heard of any crashes of the space carriers. A major underlying factor for those who demand “Hard Proof” is the strange assumption that they are experts on the behavior of aliens. Dr. Isaac Asimov long ago proclaimed that if aliens were visiting the earth, they would either make themselves known or hide completely. If they do neither, they are not coming here! One would think he had been in touch with aliens in the real world as opposed to his science fiction world. Dr. Donald Menzel, Harvard Univer- sity astronomer, UFO debunker, and se- cretly involved in all kinds of covert ac- tivities for the CIA, NSA, Office of Naval Intelligence, etc, claimed that if aliens were coming here they would cer- tainly wish to talk to the National Acad- emy of Sciences. These same experts also claim only country bumpkins are abducted; surely aliens would want prominent people. On the contrary, population studies and polls almost invariably use random sampling. Serious abduction researchers such as Budd Hopkins and Dr. David Jacobs have worked with doctors, lawyers, chemists, psychiatrists, police officers, etc. Some say aliens couldn’t possibly cre- ate hybrids between us and them. We grow trees in which we have introduced genetic material that programs them to produce an insecticide. Of course, it should be obvious that there is a technique that should be able to provide really hard proof. One could establish a major world- wide sophisticated ground radar network accompanied by a network of satellites linked by sophisticated communication systems to share data about any strange uncorrelated target observed by either or both monitoring systems. This would lead to actions to destroy any intruders manifesting a threat. It should also indicate crashes of unidenti- fied intruders so that recovery actions could be taken. Great idea! It has, of course, already been implemented by major countries looking for attacks from enemy plane armadas and Inter Continental Ballistic Missiles. This data is certainly born clas- sified. The annual costs of these highly clas- sified Aerospace Defense Commands, often observing uncorrelated targets, are many billions of dollars per year. I don’t know of any ufologist having access to this data. I am also not aware of any private individual able to afford to set up such a system. It seems to me to be as irrational to demand HARD PROOF of alien origins for some UFOs as to demand that I pro- duce an eclipse of the moon tomorrow night to prove that such events some- times occur.

It began in 1970 with a meeting with a Czechoslovakian engineer, Tony Horak, who was then in the U.S., but who had been taken to a strange cave near Levoca, Czechoslovakia, during WW II.

World’s Best UFO Cases By Dwight Connelly, editor, MUFON UFO Journal"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":" January 2007 24 MUFON UFO Journal The Night Sky By Gavin A. J. McLeod February 2007 Sky Moon Phases: Full Moon Feb. 2 Last Quarter Feb. 10 New Moon Feb. 17 First Quarter Feb. 24 Bright Planets (Evening Sky) Mercury (magnitude -0.9 to 4.4): From Aquarius into Capricornus. For northern hemisphere observers, Mercury will shine at magnitude -0.6 about 7 de- grees below Venus in the west-south- west twilight. For less favored southern hemisphere observers, Mercury will be visible just above the west-southwest horizon at sunset, but will be lost in the glare of the Sun by mid-month.. Venus (magnitude -3.8): In Sagit- tarius. For northern hemisphere observ- ers, Venus will be visible in the west southwest evening sky just above Mer- cury. By month’s end Venus will stand about 19 degrees high in the west-south- west twilight sky. For southern hemisphere observers, Venus will be visible all month in the western evening sky. By month’s end Venus will stand about 16 degrees above the western horizon. Saturn (magnitude 0.0): In Leo. For northern hemisphere observers, Saturn will rise after sunset in the east-north- east, rise to about 66 degrees near 11 PM and set in the west-northwest just after sunrise. For southern hemisphere observers, Saturn will rise just before sunset, reach an altitude of 51 degrees near 12:45 AM, and stand about 18 degrees above the northwest horizon at sunrise. Bright Planets (Morning Sky) Mars (magnitude 1.4 to 1.3): Mov- ing from Sagittarius to Capricornus. For northern hemisphere observers, Mars will rise near 5:30 AM in the southeast and will stand about 9 degrees above the southeast horizon as the Sun rises. For more favored southern hemi- sphere observers, Mars will rise above the east-southeast horizon near 3 AM and stand about 23 degrees above the east-southeast horizon as the Sun rises. Jupiter (magnitude -1.9 to 2.0): In Ophiuchus. For northern hemisphere observers, Jupiter will rise in the east- southeast after midnight and will stand about 26 degrees high at the beginning of morning twilight. For southern hemisphere observers, Jupiter will rise near 1:30 AM in the east-southeast and will stand about 46 degrees above the eastern horizon as the Sun rises. Other Celestial Phenomena Zodiacal Light : Zodiacal light will be visible in northern latitudes in the west after evening twilight beginning Wednes- day, Feb. 4, and lasting two weeks. The phenomenon is visible only from very dark locations. Zodiacal light is the result of sunlight bouncing off dust grains in our solar sys- tem. These grains lie mostly in the plane of the solar system. Look for a pyramid of light in the evening sky somewhat in appearance to the light from a city or town just over the horizon. Conjunctions and Occultations : Feb. 2: Saturn 0.9 degrees south of the Moon. Feb. 17: Venus 2 degrees south of the Moon. Feb. 3 after sunset, looking west. The two innermost planets close to- gether in the sky is a relatively rare sight."}]
