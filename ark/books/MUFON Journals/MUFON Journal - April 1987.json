FROM THE EDITOR If what's coming in over the transom is any indication, this could well be a pivotal year for ufology in more ways than one. Much of the . editorial input concerns two controversial books, Whitley Strieber's Communion and Budd Hopkins' Intruders, which deal with the abduction experience in new depth and immediacy. Those with long memories can still remember a time when abduction accounts were discounted on the face of it, in much the same way that N1CAP and other early UFO organizations dismissed the first humanoid occupant cases. Obviously, the humanoid reports did not go away, and neither did the abductions. Both have now been universally, if uneasily, incorporated within the UFO lexcion. But Communion and/nf ruders combined represent a giant step in the interpretation of UFO occupant behavior. Whether either (or neither) of those interpretations will be assimilated into ufology at large remains to be seen. For the moment, a clear and presumably logical progression in the evolution of the extraterrestrial hypothesis seems self-evident. Shortly after the UFO phenomenon itself was established, its otherworldly origin was taken for granted. Then the presence of humanoid beings aboard UFOs was gradually assumed, though interaction with humans was generally regarded as passive, or nonexistent. Finally, came the admission that UFO occupants were actively engaged in abductions of unwitting human beings as a prelude to physical examination. Now, Intruders, at least, has raised the stakes of the ET interface even higher by outlining a sophisticated program of genetic experimentation, involving sperm extraction and artificial insemination by alien visitors. To accomplish such a program, a mind-boggling logistics operation involving the monitoring of abductees, in. some cases since childhood, is called for. It's too early to tell which way the willow will bend. What is known is that in issues to come, the forges of ufology are apt to heat up. And where there's smoke, there's fire. From the ashes a bird of a new order should emerge. In this issue LIGHT YEARS: AN OPEN LETTER by Gary Kinder  3 HOLY COMMUNION? by Dr. Barry H.

Had I not been involved with the arrival of a new daughter two weeks ago, I would have written this letter much sooner. I know that many of you were confused to hear I was writing a book on Meier; I also know that most of you will understand when I offer a proper explanation. Here it is. Though no one in the UFO community has seen the manuscript for LIGHT YEARS, much of the vehemence over its publication seems to arise from a feeling that I betrayed the UFO community, that I pretended to be interested in ufology, its history, arid its people, when my only intention was to write about Meier. Some of you may.have felt used. I have been researching the Meier case since the fall of 1983. In 1984 and the first half of 1985,1 made three trips to Switzerland totaling about thirteen weeks in country visiting the alleged contact sites, speaking with Meier, interviewing witnesses (some of whom are detractors), and talking to neighbors, town administrators, etc. I also made side trips to Munich and London. In the States I traveled several times to Phoenix, Tucson, Flagstaff, San Jose, and the Los Angeles area to speak with the people who had investigated the case, the ufologists who had called it a hoax (Korff, Lorenzen, Moore, Spaulding), and the scientists who had analyzed the Meier evidence. Yes, qualified scientists, engineers, and a special effects expert did analyze the Meier evidence. Everyone I talked to in the UFO community, except Lou Farrish, warned me that the Meier case was poison. They said that Meier made preposterous claims about traveling back and forth in time to speak with Jesus and to photograph the future destruction of San Francisco. Some pointed to Bill Spaulding and said that he had found ten of the Meier photos to be patently fraudulent. Others pointed to Kal Korff, who, they claimed, had conducted an exemplary investigation of the case. After two years of research and over 120 interviews in Switzerland and the U.S., I finally told my editor I simply could not make sense of the Meier case; it all was too confusing, and I had no idea how to begin laying out the story. If everything I had uncovered concerning the case had proved to be negative, I would have found it easy to abandon the project — my editor had given me that option from the beginning; the problem was that I discovered many aspects of the case that truly were intriguing and difficult to explain. In the meantime I had read many books on ufology to become familiar with the field, and I found the UFO community and the history of UFOs fascinating. I felt there was a book in it, and during the fall of 1985 I began to focus my research on the broader picture, traveling first to Washington, D.C., to spend a week with Dick Hall, Bruce Maccabee, Larry Bryant, et al., though I still was under contract for a book on Meier. (When Maccabee asked me how I became interested in the field, I told him and several others present at a Fund meeting that my first exposure was through the Meier case.) My editor agreed that a bigger UFO book would be a good one. I began to concentrate on this book, quitting work on Meier, packing up all of my research on him in big boxes, and throwing them into the basement. When I spoke with the Washington, D.C. group, and later in the spring/summer of 1986 attended Hal Starr's conference in Phoenix, the MUFON symposium in Lansing, and Sprinkle's contactee convention in Laramie, I myself was under the impression my research was for a book on ufology, not the Meier case. At the same time I began traveling to attend the variou UFO symposia to acquaint myself with more of the community, my editor met with me in Phoenix at Starr's conference and encouraged me at least to give the Meier story a try, just to write it simply and as it happened. Continue to research the other book, he said, but get something on paper about Meier. With that completed, I could go on to the bigger book on ufology. So I pulled my Meier research out of the basement and forced myself to sit down and wade through all of it to try to piece something together. Once I did that, though, all of a sudden LIGHT YEARS came pouring out of me. A 15- page treatment grew in three weeks to a 100-page outline, and in three months I had a 300-page manuscript. Then I re- wrote and re-wrote and re-wrote. Once it began to fall together I liked it more, and when I assembled all of the quotes from the scientists the story began to feel far more solid than it had while I was researching. I also finally located the two sound engineers who had analyzed Meier's. audio tapes, and the special effects expert who had studied the Meier 8mm footage and some of the photos back in 1980. The two engineers told me the sounds were unlike anything they had ever heard, or seen, on a spectrum analyzer. The special effects expert informed me that Meier could have created the films and photographs only with a team of experts and tens of thousands of dollars worth of sophisticated equipment. (From my own experiences in Switzerland I knew that neither of these existed.) I had heard so many negative references to Meier for so long I had nearly forgotten similar intriguing things that the the scientists had told me two years earlier. (continued next page)"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"FINAL DRAFT My editor liked what I was writing. He showed it to the people at Atlantic Monthly Press, where he has his new imprint, and everyone there liked it too. Last October they took the first half of the manuscript to the Frankfurt Book • Fair as their lead title, while I continued to work on the manuscript, as it was far from being finished. I honestly don't know how many drafts I finally completed, but the figure is somewhere between five and seven. Then last fall two things happened: My editor felt that the Meier story needed to be set in historical context, that I needed to provide the reader with background on the UFO phenomenon itself. Not only did I already have a tremendous amount of research in that area, I had also completed 35 pages of a proposal on the bigger UFO book. I expanded that work, pulled in more detail, and weaved it into the Meier story. You will find about one-half of the second half of LIGHT YEARS is all Arnold, Robertson, Condon, Hynek, Blue Book, Hill, etc. The seond thing that happened was that when my editor took the manuscript to Frankfurt he discovered that even in Europe books on UFOs are difficult to sell, too difficult. After that experience he and his publisher both told me they felt it would be unwise for .me to follow a book on Meier with another book on UFOs. So we decided to utilize all of my research into the history of ufology for the Meier book and go on to something new for my next project, a decision that frankly left me not too unhappy. Ufology is a frustrating field to research and more frustrating to try to make sense of and put down on paper in a readable fashion. Emotions run so high and name-calling among the ufologists (even without the Meier case) is so rampant, a writer finds himself wallowing in explanations and counter explanations until every sentence dissolves, into battle and nothing is decided. Anyhow, the foregoing is why many of you (and I) thought I was researching a book on ufology when we met in Michigan, or Washington, D.C., 4 or Phoenix, or Laramie. Prior to beginning that general research, I always informed those I interviewed that while I wished to know more about the entire field, I was particularly interested in the Meier case. Spaulding, Moore, Lorenzen, Korff, Starr, all knew back in 1984-85 that I was looking primarily at the Meier case during the early part of my research. This sentence from my letter to Kal Korff on March 28, 1985; is indicative: \"I am researching a book about the UFO community, what it does, who .it is, where it is (in more ways than one). I'm particularly interested in the Swiss Case or the Meier case, which seems to have generated a fair amount of emotion within the community. I know you have referred to it.as the most infamous hoax in the history of ufology.\" The next quote cames from a letter written by Bill Spauling the day after I interviewed him. • \"It was a pleasure talking to you on January 6,1985 regarding the subject of unidentified flying objects and the Billy Meier hoaxed UFO photographs... Because the Meier incident is such an obvious hoax, any further publicity extended to this incident...will only provide additional exposure to this case... We cannot involve ourselves to any extent which . could further generate favorable publicity for the conspirators of the Pleiades book.\" In a small community whose members correspond regularly, it was no secret that I was researching the Meier case. Now on to the substance of LIGHT YEARS. Many of the witnesses I interviewed in Switzerland, none of whom had ever been contacted by anyone in ufology, had seen things happen to Meier that no one could explain: Standing next to another man, he once disappeared instantly from the roof of a barn twelve feet off the ground; in a separate incident he suddenly reappeared, warm and dry, in a group of men standing in a dark and secluded forest in a freezing rainstorm. These scenes, associated with alleged contact experiences, appear in much greater detail in the book. They may be tricks, but if so they were performed by a master illusionist. When Meier claimed to have had a contact, sets of three six-foot diameter circles would appear in a meadow surrounded by thick woods. I did not see these myself, but I talked to several people who had seen them and who had photographed them while still fresh. Swirled counter-clockwise and perfectly delineated in tall grass, one set remained for nine weeks, until a farmer came and mowed the grass. Here is the mystery of the landing tracks: Grass that is green rises even after being mashed down; grass that dies turns brown and lies flat. This grass remained green but never rose; it continued to grow in a flat circle. The landing tracks puzzled everyone I spoke to who had viewed them, including Meier's most ardent detractor, Hans Schutzbach. Schutzbach told me that other people had tried to duplicate the landing tracks, but that their efforts were \"a bad copy.\" Meier's were \"perfect.\" I listened to dozens of such stories, so many I could not include all of them in the book, including nighttime sightings of strange lights reported by a variety of people, many of whom witnessed the same incidents and corroborated each other's accounts. One nighttime.photograph, taken by a school principal from Austria during an alleged contact, will appear in the book. On the other side, I know that Meier's photos of the alleged future destruction of San Francisco, for instance, came right out of the September, 1977, issue of CEO Magazine. After one of the witnesses reported this to me ; I found the magazine myself and compared the photographs. They were identical. All of this is in the book — the crazy claims, the apparent lies, the unexplained disappearances, the mysterious landing tracks, all weaved into the narrative. MORE EVIDENCE In London, Timothy Good provided me with many lengthy letters from Lou Zinsstag (who often had been pointed out by ufologists in the States as one who thought that Meier was a fraud and \"crazy\"). Zinsstag had written the letters between June, 1976, and October, 1977, as she investigated Meier and reported back to Good. In one letter she calls Meier \"the most"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"intriguing man I have ever met.\" She goes into great detail in her observations, including a description of \"this feeling of discomfort\" she experiences in Meier's presence. In another letter she writes, \"If Meier turns out to be a fake, I shall take my whole collection of photographs to the ferry boat and drown it in the old man river of Basle.\"  '. • J Back in the States I interviewed nine scientists/engineers/special effects experts who had analyzed or otherwise studied the Meier evidence. (One, Bob Post, is none of the three, but heads the photo lab at JPL.) Following is a sampling of what they had to say. Realize that where the photos are concerned an original transparency was never available for analysis, so none of the work done on those was definitive (Spaulding himself told me he had no idea the generation of the photographs he analyzed); however, knowing this limitation, the scientists who did agree to examine them told me they would have been able to detect all but a very sophisticated hoax. Dr. Michael Malin is an associate professor of planetary sciences at Arizona State University; he wrote his doctoral thesis on the computer analysis of spacecraft images beamed back from Mars. He was at JPL for four years and he's worked with the special effects people at LucasFilm. He works under various government grants at ASU, and a recent experiment he devised has just been accepted for a future Shuttle launch. A friend of mine who is the science editor at National Geographic and who has researched and written many cover stories on the Universe, the Space Shuttle, etc., had spoke to Malin before and once told me, \"If Malin : says it, you can believe it.\" Here is one thing Malin said concerning the Meier photographs which he analyzed in 1981: \"I find the photographs themselves incredible, they're good photographs. They appear to represent a real phenomenon. The story that some farmer in Switzerland is on a first name basis with dozens of aliens who come and visit him...I find that incredible. But I find the photographs more credible. They're reasonable evidence of something. What that something is I don't know.\" Malin also told. me, \"If the photographs are hoaxes then I am intrigued by the quality of the hoax. How did he do it? I'm always interested in seeing a master at work.\" These quotes, and all of the rest of the quotes I attribute to the scientists here, appear verbatim in the book. . SOUNDS Steve Ambrose, sound engineer for Stevie Wonder and inventor of the Micro Monitor, a radio set complete with speaker that fits inside Wonder's ear, analyzed the Meier sound recordings. \"The sound recording's got some surprising things in it,\" he told me. \"How would you duplicate it? I'm not Just talking about how to duplicate it audio-wise, but how do you show those various things on a spectrum analyzer and on the 'scope that it was doing? It's one thing to make something that sounds like it, it's another thing to make something that sounds like it and has those consistent : and ; random . oscillations , in it. The sound of the spacecraft,\" he added, \"was a single sound source recording that had an amazing frequency response. If it is a hoax I'd like to meet the guy that did it, because he could probably make a lot of money in special -effects.\" His findings were corroborated by another sound engineer named Nils Rognerud. , In 1979 Dr. Robert Nathan at JPL was sufficiently impressed with the Meier photographs .to. have copies made of Meier transparencies at the JPL photo lab. After the transfer he refused to analyze the photographs, however, because his developer discovered they were . several generations away from the originals. Nathan felt that the transparencies were so far away in generation from the photographs he had seen that Wendelle Stevens had attempted to trick him. Later, I showed the Meier films to Nathan, and he laughed at some of them, but he couldn't figure out how Meier flew the ship into a scene and had it come to a sudden halt; or how it could hover motionless while a pine branch in the lower right corner blows in a stiff wind. Nathan said, \"He would have to be awfully clever, because that's a very steady holding. It would have to be a very, very good tethering.\" Then he said, \"Apparently he's a sharp guy, very clever. So he should be given some points for effort.\" Nathan concluded about the films, \"If this is a hoax, and it. looks like it is to me but I have no proof, this is very carefully done. Tremendous amount of effort. An awful lot of work for one guy.\" From all of the scientists, these were the most negative comments I received. With Nathan saying that in theory the films could be hoaxed, I was curious about the logistics involved. Then I discovered that a special effects expert, Wally Gentleman, who for ten' years had served as Director of Special Effects on the Canadian Film Board and who; for a year and a half, was director of special photographic effects for Stanley Kubrick's film 2001, had viewed these same films. This is what he told me: \"To produce the films, Meier really had to. have a fleet of clever assistants, at least 15 people. And the equipment would be totally out of [Meier's] means. If somebody wanted to cheat one of the films, $30,000 would probably do it, but this is in a studio where the equipment exists. The equipment would cost another $50,000.\" That's for each of the seven Meier films. Gentleman also had examined the photographs. \"My greatest problem is that.for anybody faking this,\" [he pointed to one of the photographs], \"the shadow that is thrown onto that tree , is correct. Therefore, if somebody is faking it they have an expert there. And being an expert myself, I know that that expert knowledge is very hard to come by. So I say, 'Well, is that expert knowledge there or isn't it there?' Because if the expert knowledge isn't there, this has got to be real.\" Then there is Robert Post, who had been at the JPL photo laboratory for 22 years and was the head of that lab in 1979, when Nathan brought the Meier photos to him to have copies made. Post oversees the developing and printing of every photograph that comes out of JPL. Though he analyzed. nothing, his eye for spotting fabrications far surpasses a lay person's. Post told me: \"From a 5"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"photography standpoint, you couldn't see anything that was fake about the Meier photos. That's what struck me. They looked like legitimate photographs. I thought, 'God, if this is real, this is going to be really something'.\" Besides working in the highly classified field of military defense, David Froning, an astronautical engineer with McDonnell Douglas for 25 years, has done exploratory research to develop ideas and technology for advanced spacecraft design. As a longtime member of the British Interplanetary Society and the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, he has presented many papers on interstellar flight at technical conferences in Europe and the United States. In October, 1985, he addressed the XXXVI International Astronautical Congress in Stockholm. Froning's wife discovered at a friend's house the photo journal published by the Elders in fall, 1979, and took it home to her husband because of one word in the text. - tachyon. In Meier's notes from 1975, he spoke of the tachyon propulsion system utilized by the Pleiadians. For over a year Froning had been spending most of his spare time working to design just such a theoretical system. When he read more of Meier's notes on faster-than-light travel (he had contacted the Elders and Stevens for more information), he found that Meier's figures for the time required to achieve the speed of light (at which point, according to Meier, the tachyon system would kick in to make the hyper leap), and the distance a ship would have traveled at that point, were within 20 percent of his own calculations determined through the use of complex acceleration formulas. Froning told me, \"If what this Meier is saying is just a hoax, he's being cued by some very knowledgeable scientists. I've only discussed this Meier case with scientists who are fairly openminded about interstellar flights, but I'll tell you, the majority of them think it's credible and agree with at least part, or sometimes' all, of the things talked about by the Pleiadians.\" During my research I read an article from a British publication called 6 The Unexplained, in which the author, referring to the alleged Meier metal analysis by Marcel Vogel at IBM, wrote, \"Jim Delettoso characteristically failed to further the cause by claiming that [the Elders] hold a 10-hour videotape of 'the entire lab proceedings' (which Dr. Vogel denies having made). 'And,' Dilettoso incautiously persisted, \"we have about an hour of him discussing why the metal samples are not possible in earth technology, going into intrinsic detail of why it is not done anywhere on earth.'\" The author, of course, is poking fun at such a claim. I have seen that video. I have also seen another video in which Vogel states, \"I cannot explain the metal sample. By any known combination of materials I could not put it together myself, as a scientist. With any technology that I know of, we could not achieve this on this planet.\" I've interviewed Vogel twice and he insists that the metal sample he spent so much time analyzing is unique. I spoke with him again three weeks ago and to this day he remains fascinated with the specimen. He said that if the metal sample had not disappeared while in his possession, he would now be continuing research on it with a number of other scientists from IBM and Ames Research. A reporter from the Washington Post also called Vogel two days ago and Vogel again verified the above quote. With the exception of Vogel, and possibly Nathan, though he doesn't remember, none of these men had ever been interviewed by anyone in the UFO community. And Vogel even said to me on tape regarding one of the ufologists who did interview him about Meier: \"Treat him with caution. He'll ramble on and he'll quote you out of context. So watch it.\" He also told me this same person \"has taken my statements completely out of context and published them. This case has been badly mangled:\" DOUBLE CHECK In the book, I go into much greater detail with each of the scientists and engineers. I mention each by his real name (as I do everyone else in the story) and I include his place of employment. After completing the final draft of the manuscript I mailed to each of the scientists a packet which included everything in the manuscript pertaining to him. I asked that each make any corrections, technical or otherwise, he cared to make. I have heard back now from all of them either by mail or by phone during the past six weeks. Some had nothing to change, others had minor changes. Everything concerning their analyses of the evidence will appear in the book exactly as they have authorized it to appear. (Two weeks . before sending his letter to my publisher attempting to persuade him not to publish LIGHT YEARS, Walt Andrus called me and we talked for forty-five minutes. During that conversation, I told Andrus of the comments made by the scientists. I gave him their names, I spelled the names for him, I gave him their places of employment, and I encouraged him to contact them for verification of their statements, three of which appeared in an ad for the book in \"Publishers Weekly.\" Apparently, he never did so.) In his letter to me Michael Malin opened with this:' \"Thanks for letting me see what you have written. It's a credit to your writing that I cannot tell whether you are a supporter or a detractor of 1 Dilettoso, and of the claims of the people who supplied the UFO images.\" Eric Eliason of the U.S. Geological Survey in Flagstaff, Arizona, is the ninth of the experts I spoke with. After receiving his packet, he wrote to me, \"Thank you for the accurate representation of my views on the Meier UFO photographs. If your LIGHT YEARS publication remains as objective as the pages you provided, I will look forward to reading what you have to say.\" Eliason creates image processing software so astrogeologists can analyze photographs of the planets beamed back from space. He spent two years producing the intricate radar map of cloud covered Venus acquired by Pioneer 10, and his software has been applied in processing space photography beamed back by both Viking and Voyager. He was sent to France and to China as a representative of the U.S. space"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"program and an expert in . image processing. He had analyzed the Meier . photos on his equipment in 1981. He told me in an interview in August, 1984: \"In the photographs there were no sharp breaks where you could see it had been somehow artificially dubbed. And if that dubbing was registered in the film, the computer would have seen it. We didn't see anything.\" What would you do with evidence like this? Would you disregard it because Meier makes outlandish claims? Or because a ufologist reports that a colleague in Germany has a friend who saw ropes and pulleys hanging in Meier's barn? Or because Wendelle Stevens is a believer anyhow? Or because Wendelle Stevens is now in prison? Or because Meier has an 18- inch model of one of the Pleiadian beamships sitting in his office? Or because a group of believers has formed around the man? And if you had a choice between the analyses performed by the scientists Malin at ASU and Eliason at USGS and those performed by Bill Spaulding at Ground Saucer Watch, on which would you stake your reputation? After all of the bad- mouthing given the Meier case, I was surprised to learn that ufologists like Walt Andrus had never heard of Malin, or Eliason, or Gentleman, or Froning, or Ambrose, or even the alleged detractors in Switzerland, Hans Schutzbach and Martin Sorge. Schutzbach 'was Meier's right- hand man for two years, with him night and day, driving him to contacts, organizing and cataloguing all of the photographs, measuring and photographing the landing tracks. Then they had a falling out, and Schutzbach left. He hates Meier and is certain Meier is a fraud; if anyone would know Meier's \"technique\" and be ready to divulge it, Schutzbach would be the man, yet to this day he has no clue how Meier could have made the tracks, or the photos, or the sound recordings, or the films. Nor does he have even one suggestion for an accomplice. Sorge, a cultured man with a university degree in chemistry and author of two books, had been mentioned frequently by ufologists as the one who discovered charred photographs and thereby exposed Meier as a fraud. He told me in the summer of 1985 that he is \"certain\" the contacts took place, though in a different fashion than Meier describes. He also told me the real story of how he obtained the burned slides. That, too, is much different than the version I got from ufologists here in the States. Again, all of this is in the book. One of the more interesting ironies in the current uprising of the UFO community against the publication of LIGHT YEARS is that every time someone slams the book (before it has been read) he points to Bill Spaulding and Kal Korff as the two authorities in whose skills the community places great faith. After all of the negative comments I have heard about Bill Spaulding's work from various members of the UFO community, why would anyone rely on his analysis of anything? Bill Moore, who is not known for his kind feelings toward the Meier case or the people who investigated it, had this to say about Spaulding in an interview on March 25, 1985: \"He's generally regarded by anybody in the field as somebody to ignore. It's all puffery. He wrote a paper on the analysis of photographs, and I have a critique of that paper by a scientist who knows what he's talking about, and he just rips it to shreds. It sounds good unless you know what the system is and then you realize that the guy's a phony.\" While Korff was young and inexperienced, these factors do not necessarily discredit his work. But I am certain that few ufologists have heard him say what he told me in an interview on April 13, 1985: \"I'm even open to the possibility that Meier had some genuine experience somewhere in there,\" he said, \"but there's so much noise around his signal that I don't even know how to sift it. I've always maintained that, yeah, maybe there's something to it. Most of the people who have read my work say, 'Ah, the Meier case is totally a hoax, there's nothing to it.' I say, The claims [Stevens and the Elders] have made don't hold up; but it's possible the guy may have something somewhere.\" After three years of researching and thinking about this story it finally came clear to me that two things kept the UFO community from taking a far more serious look at the Meier case: One, of course, is Meier's preposterous claims, and (in an ongoing effort to insulate itself from the fringe) the general reluctance of the community to accept any claim of contact, especially repeated contact; the other is that Lee Elders grabbed all of the evidence and sat on it. George Earley, after reviewing the Elders's UFO...Contact from the Pleiades, wrote in Saucer Smear that until the Intercept group produced some of the evidence they claimed to have, they deserved to be castigated by the UFO community. And Earley was right. So was Korff. The claims by themselves don't hold up. But the evidence in fact existed; I've talked to the people who examined it. CONCLUSIONS None of the foregoing is offered as proof that Meier sat in a Swiss meadow and conversed with Pleiadians, but only to demonstrate that people intrigued by the Meier case, who see a fascinating story in the man, are not simplistic in their thinking. No one, including Stevens and the Elders, has ever claimed he possesses irrefutable evidence of the Meier contacts, and I do not make that claim now. No one in ufology can make that statement about any case. . . After I sent a letter similar to this one to Jerry Clark, he responded that while he continued to have serious reservations about Meier's claims to meet with extraterrestrials, he, too, found the Meier story \"fascinating.\" \"My colleagues are going to be astounded and confused,\" he wrote. \"It really has been an article on faith among us (me included) that this whole' business was just an exercise in heavy- handed fraud. But apparently you have shown it is rather more interesting than that. It's ironic. Ufologists forever complain that scientists and debunkers won't take an objective look at the UFO evidence. You have demonstrated, I think, that in this case the ufologists acted just like the people they criticize.\" You will find the book a balanced report that holds many surprises for you and other ufologists, and in no way degrades the stature of the UFO"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"community or impedes its progress. Due to cooperation from many of you, the historical sections in LIGHT YEARS will provide readers with a true appreciation of the UFO phenomenon and those who study it. Like Jerry Clark, I myself remain fascinated with Meier, but uncertain about the truth behind the actual contacts. I end LIGHT YEARS with this: \"I would not call him a prophet, though he may be. I would not rule out imposter, though I have no proof. I know that if you boiled the story in a kettle you would find a hard residue composed of two things: One would be Meier's ravings about time travel, space travel, philosophy, and religion; the other would be the comments by the scientists and engineers impressed with the evidence he has produced. I can't believe the former, nor can I dismiss the latter. He may simply be one of the finest illusionists the world has ever known, possessing not the power but the skill to persuade others to see things that did not happen and do not exist. Perhaps he has no such ability; perhaps beings on a much higher plane have selected him and controlled him and used him for reasons far beyond our comprehension. I do know this: Trying to make sense of it all has been the most difficult thing I will ever do. Finally I realized, as the Elders had years before, that the truth of the Meier contacts will never be known.\" HOLY COMMUNION? By Dr. Barry H. Downing Dr. Downing is a MUFON consultant in Theology. The publication of Whitley Strieber's book Communion: A True Story (Beech Tree Books, New York, 1987), represents a welcome addition to the growing literature concerning CE III UFO cases. Budd Hopkins (Missing Time), with whom Strieber has consulted, would classify Strieber's experience as essentially a Type 3 abduction case (Hopkins' classifi- cation), essentially a bedroom abduction similar to the Betty Andreasson story (Fowler, The /Andreasson Affair). What sets Strieber apart is that he is a well known author (The Wolfen, The Hunger, and co-author of Warday). Strieber has the intellectual and literary skill to give his experience an excellent analytical treatment. Although Strieber, under hypnosis, discovered several probable UFO contacts in his life, his major experience occurred on December 26, 1985. (Whether this day after Christmas date is of religous significance I am not sure.) He was in bed with his wife when he became aware of a presence, he was taken somewhere in an undressed state, examined, confronted by what he believed was a feminine being, and taken back home. The title for the book was 8 suggested by Strieber's wife, as she talked in her sleep. The concept of \"communion,\" however, is the central conclusion at which Strieber arrives about the meaning of UFO visitation. \"They\" are trying to get to know us, and have us know them, be in communion with them. Strieber does not want to call these beings angels or demons. Strieber says, \"They take us in the night. They introduce their instruments and thus their reality into our brains. It is, however, too easy to call them evil, just as it is too easy to say that they are saints, kindly guides from the beyond. They are a very real and immensely complex force, the provocative nature of which demands neither hate nor love, but rather respect in a context of intellectual objectivity and emotional strength.\" (p. 276-77) Strieber does not intend that his book be a religious treatment of UFOs, and his above statement represents his concern that care be given not to give too easy a religious interpretation of his experience. Nevertheless, religious issues are clearly raised by experiences such as those of Strieber and Andreasson. The issue of UFOs and religion is one of the many difficult aspects to the total UFO problem. The U.S. government, with its ridicule and cover- up technique, has kept the study of UFOs from being properly accepted by the public. Fear of government power has probably kept many government employed scientists from appearing seriously interested in UFO studies. PLATO IN SPACE SUIT With this already difficult credibility problem, the scientific study of UFOs has undoubtedly been less than happy with the \"religious nut fringe\" that has been part of the UFO scene, with its cults.like that of \"The Two\" a few years ago, and early contactees like Orfeo Angelucci, Daniel Fry, and Howard Menger. Whereas the early UFO contact cases seemed to be meeting Plato in a space suit, offering plans for peace and scientific advancement, the more recent contact cases involve deep psychological experiences,, and symbolism that may or may not be religious in intention (the triangle on the arm of Strieber, the phoenix seen by Andreasson). I do not believe that the UFO mystery can be solved without serious input from the religious community. It is students of religion and myth who deal most frequently with the types of material we are now facing in the Strieber and Andreasson case, and I doubt that an accurate interpretation of what is happening can occur without professional religious scholarship being applied."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"Ted Jacobs/Photo ( Up until the present time, there has been little interest in the Christian community in the UFO issue. Recently I surveyed over 100 Protestant and Roman Catholic Seminaries in the United, States, to discover which, if any, are exploring the possible relation between UFOs and religion. I was not surprised to discover only two cases where the subject has even been discussed, and there were other cases where the. person responding to the questions made it clear that his or her name was not to be used. Strieber tries to interpret some of t his experience in terms of the 1 symbolism of several world religious. My main interest (as a Presbyterian. Pastor) has been the relation between the biblical religion and UFOs. In my book, The Bible and Flying Saucers, I mainly explored \"multiple witness'\" UFO sightings such as the \"pillar of cloud and of fire\" of the Exodus, the \"chariot of fire\" of Elijah, and the \"bright light\" which blinded the Apostle Paul on the Damascus Road. I purposely ignored the psychological dimensions of the UFO problem, in part because when my book was published in 1968, the good modern contact stories had not yet been written, and in part because the psychological dimensions of the UFO problem make an unbelievable problem even more unbelievable. HIGHER REALITY The main new element which we now confront, in regard to UFOs and religion, is that it now seems clear that the UFO reality has both the technical and psychological ability to have brought about the biblical religion. One clear aspect of the biblical religion is that a \"higher reality\" revealed itself to us humans, sometimes visibly (as with the \"pillar of cloud and fire\" of the Exodus), but sometimes through psychic dreams or visions (Abraham, Genesis 15:17, Peter, Acts 10:10). The Apostle Paul went through what we would now call a CE III experience on the Damascus Road (Acts 9:1-9), with a bright light flashing overhead, a voice of Jesus speaking to him, and temporary blindness being a side effect from the experience. Others with Paul heard the voice, but saw no person. Paul was apparently not abducted at this point, but continued with help to Damascus, where he met .Christians, who healed his blindness. Paul says in Galatians 1:11-2:2 that he received all his Christian knowledge through a series of revelations, not by having anyone teach him. How does he explain these revelations? In Galatians he does not explain, but in 2 Corinthians 12:1-4 he . says: \"I must boast; there is nothing to be gained by it, but I will go on to visions and revelations of the Lord. I know a man in Christ who fourteen years ago was caught up to the third heaven — whether in the body or out of the body I do not know, God knows. And I know that this man was caught up into Paradise — whether in the body or out of the body I do not know, God knows — and he heard things that cannot be told, which man may not utter.\" Betty Andreasson and Whitley Strieber were taken somewhere, whether in the body or out of the body they could hardly tell, because of the semi-trance state they seemed to be in. Yet, the experience seemed to be too real to be only, a dream. Whatever it is that is going on now, it sounds like the main Apostle of Christianity, Paul, went through similar events almost 2000 years ago. I suspect .

For many years, there has existed an assumption within UFO research and investigations. The late Dr. J. Allen Hynek took it for granted and once made particular mention of it .in a private discussion. Numerous other authors on the subject have alluded to it in presenting their cases. In fact, we in the business have come to look askance at reports that fail to satisfy the assumption, which is this:. UFO incidents occur only during good weather. For lack of funding and specific interest, the assumption has not been tested on a broad scale.

The axiom of good weather is not without foundation. A thunderstorm was .associated with one alleged UFO crash four decades ago, after all. And presumably inclement conditions would entail contrivances such as windshield wipers, steel belted landing pods, and sealed-beam running lights. Comical images aside, it is simply easier to fathom anomalous vehicles under a bevy of stars and a clear sky. Over a decade of investigations in Michigan, a hackneyed truism has mostly proved valid. If you don't like the weather, just wait a minute. By reason of its latitude, position among the Great Lakes and other factors, Michigan's so- called temperate climate is frequently harsh in its cold, wet and humid extremes. Our state's folklore on weather is one of change and unsettled conditions. Hence, one might assume that most or all of Michigan's UFO : reports would be jammed into the comparatively few balmy evenings that are left. Such is not the case. DATA GATHERING Through the cooperation of Mark Rodeghier, Scientific Director of the Center for UFO Studies, and Dr. Fred Nurnberger, Chairman of Michigan State University's Climatology . Division, nearly four hundred Michigan UFO cases were plotted against eight specific weather factors. The project covers the 1947-1977 period involving 396 reported UFO events, each of which is identifiable by exact date, hour of the day or more precise time, and the nearest town or city. Multiple reports from the same locale and within the span of an hour or less were counted as a single event. If included these would have increased the universe of cases by 63 percent. 10"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"There, is undoubtedly still some IFO static in the signal from the UFOCAT (UFO Catalogue) operated by CUFOS. But these refinements of an original data base comprising 1,000 total reports assign a higher credence to the 396 events analyzed. By chance, exactly half (or 198) of the Michigan events occurred during the months of November through April, which are obviously colder and in general have poorer weather. The . remaining half, then, transpired in the May-October period when conditions are most favorable. These six-month divisions are utilized extensively throughout the study. Ten first-order weather stations spread across the two Michigan peninsulas provided most of the meteorological findings, based upon hourly readings by professionals around the clock. These primary sites include Detroit (2), Flint, Lansing, Grand Rapids, Muskegon, Houghton Lake, Alpena, Sault St. Marie and Marquette. In addition, over 150 secondary stations were utilized in respect to their recorded observations of rain, snow or other precipitation near the site of a reported UFO. [A review of the actual case files would assist to some extent, although investigative reports have not systematically included weather information.] For every meteorological factor, the actual readings at the nearest hour from the station nearest to the reported incident were contrasted with the station's mean measurement for that hour and date through the same 31- year period. Table 2 indicates the proportions of events in the cold and warm months, respectively, by the recorded wind speed, shown as knots per hour (k/h), at the nearest first-order station. For November through April, nearly 70 percent of the reported events occurred with a breeze of 10 k/h or less at the nearest station, although five cases were aligned with a wind speed of over 20 k/h. The average speed of 8.8 k/h at the event hour is not substantially calmer than the mean of 10.7 for the cumulative seasonal period. May to October sightings were under calmer wind conditions, with nearly seven out of eight accompanied by a breeze of 10 k/h or less. The event hour mean wind speed of 7.2 was likewise less than the 8.7 for the overall seasonal dates. While wind speed at the hour and fairly near the reported location was usually a little calmer than the norm, the variance between cold and warm month UFO events follows the regular pattern of the state. It must, therefore, be concluded that wind is not much of a factor in Michigan UFO cases. Visibility is basically defined as the distance toward the horizon at which prominent objects can be readily discerned with unaided vision. When the visibility is at least 15 miles, there is minimal haze, smoke or measurable moisture in the air. At the hour of reported UFO incidents, Table 3 shows that the nearest first-order station recorded such an extended visibility in nine out of every twenty cases. On the other hand, every eighth event was accompanied by rather poor visibility of 5 miles or less, which is indicative of rainy or snowy weather. There are, unfortunately, insufficient meteorological figures historically on Table 6 RELATIVE HUMIDITY AT HOUR OF UFO EVENT (Percent of Events) 10PM-4AM: 4 AM- 10AM: 10AM-4PM: 4PM- 10PM: Total: 40/Under 2.0% 0 1.1% 3.6% 6.7% 41-60 4.2% 1.4% 5.1% 11.1% 21.8% 61-80 17.6% 5.8% 4.6% 14.6% 42.6% 81-100 14.9% 5.8% 2.9% 5.3% 28.9% Total Events 38.7% 13.0% 13.7% 34.6% 100. % Event Mean 73.5% 76.8% 63.6% 62.5% 68.9% Annual Mean 81.2% 82.9% 63.1% 68.4% 73. b% , Table 7 RELATIVE HUMIDITY AT HOUR OF UFO EVENT (Percent of Events) Total 40/Under 41-60 61-80 81-100 Events Nov-Apr: May-Oct: Total: 10.3% 3.0% 6.7% 24.2% 21.2% 22.7% 40.0% 40.6% 40.3% 25.5% 35.2% 30.3% 50.0% 50.0% 100. % Event Mean 66.2% 71.6% 68.9% Annual Mean 73.0% 74.6% 73.8% FINDINGS Table 1 represents the actual Fahrenheit temperature at the UFO event hour in relation to its departure from the mean for that hour and date. The strongest finding is that, in just under 80 percent of all reported events, the temperature was between 10 degrees above and below normal. The seasonal (i.e. 6-month) departure at UFO event hours is likewise significant for both the cold and warm weather months. It is thus fair to conclude that, in Michigan, temperature has nothing to do with UFO reports.

However, . it was surprising to the author to find that in a significant proportion of the cases the atmospheric clarity was less than optimal. This can be argued either as evidence of IFO static or a conclusion that atmospheric clarity is unconnected with actual UFO events. Ceiling is the distance from the ground to the lowest layer of cloud cover when the sky is at least 80 percent obscured.  , . The most prominent statistic in Table 4 is the 62.5 percent under the \"Unlimited\" column, which is to say that there'was no ceiling in five cases out of eight. But, a ceiling of 2 miles or under was present a fourth of the time, including,. 10 percent at 3,000 feet or less. Clear, starry nights? Reports of UFO activity are not so restricted. To refine this factor, sky cover is further delineated in Table 5 as to percentage, on average, of the sky obscured during each of the 6-month divisions. The mean sky cover at the UFO .event hour was much lower than the general conditions for that area, date and hour would suggest. So, with a totally cloudless sky accompanying over a third of all reported UFOs in the state, there seems to be a connection between the extremes of little cloud cover' or complete overcast and reported aerial activity. Table 6 expresses the relative humidity during reported UFO events in 6-hour blocks. During the two warmer segments comprising 10 AM to 10 PM, relative humidity of 60 percent or less was the case in over 40 percent of the cases. By contrast, incidents in the two time slots from 10 PM to 10AM occurred under comparatively muggy conditions (81- 100 percent humidity) also in two out of five cases. These differences coincide with the general meteorological readings, though. It tends to be less humid overall during the daylight hours of those months. In three of four time periods, the data suggests, the average humidity during UFO incidents was several percent less than the average recorded humidity for that time at the nearest major station. The disparity, however, is less than dramatic and, considering 12 the earlier sky cover findings, perhaps less than expected. • In Table 7, the particular UFO event dates are examined in contrast to the 6-month periods of relative humidity at the reported hour of each event. A five percent difference is found between the cumulative humidity levels at the UFO event hour in the colder and warmer months, respectively. Each in turn is a few to several percent lower than the daily mean. \\ ' Two conclusions may b'e fairly reached in this area. First, Michigan is a very humid state. Second,.the relative humidity at a point in time might, but probably does not, offer either an inducement or impediment to. aerial phenomena. Precipitation, or the lack of it, is at the heart of any discussion of weather and UFO reports. Table 8 measures the daily incidence (expressed as the mean) of at least a trace of rain or snow occurring on a given day at the nearest secondary station. This is compared with the actual precipitation during the. 24-hour period surrounding a reported UFO event. Throughout the colder, wetter 6 months, the chance of precipitation in\" . general was one-fourth greater than the incidence for 12 hours before or after a reported UFO event. While the regularity of precipitation overall declines markedly for the May-October period, in contrast it is slightly higher on UFO event days for the same months. Consequently, for the warmer months we have the unexpectedly greater likelihood of rain/snow in the time frame of a UFO event than at any other time. Table 9 further delineates the incidence of precipitation on UFO event days. The data are categorized as to occurrences up to 12 hours before the UFO report as well as up to 12 hours after and (at least nearby) during the event itself. The key numbers are the totals. In nearly two of five cases, precipitation fell before, after or both. Further, it was recorded during every twentieth event. Quite obviously, precipitation is not a deterrent to claims of visitation. CONCLUSIONS It appears from the Michigan experience that reported aerial phenomena are largely unrelated to favorable weather conditions. Moreover, given the assumption that fewer potential witnesses are outside during threatening or actual precipitation, one might project a higher percentage of UFO events during marginal weather than the data suggests. Sky cover and relative humidity were' somewhat less prevalent at the hour of reported activity. Even these factors, though, do not offer a dramatic variance from the average conditions historically. There does appear to be one further tentative conclusion, which could not be expected at the outset and so is not quantified. In a seemingly disproportionate.share of events, the aerial 'anomaly was reportedly observed within a hour or so of a several-hour rain or snow. A related, soft finding is the uncommon frequency of reports during \"windows\" in the weather — long hours or days of precipitation at the nearest secondary station broken by a 1- or 2- hour segment of no recorded precipitation.   ' Meteorology and climatology comprise an admittedly imperfect science. They depend upon human observations at no better than hourly intervals and spaced numbers of miles apart. The statistical overview presented here, therefore, is limited to pointing general directions and calling for replication elsewhere.

Rainier on June 24, 1947. The following people have agreed to speak and present papers for the symposium proceedings: Bill Chalker (Australia), Hilary Evans (England), Bertil Kuhlemann (Sweden), StantonT. Friedman (Canada), Cynthia Hind (Africa), Kanishk Nathan (India), Vincent-Juan Ballester Olmos (Spain), Capt. Daniel Perisse (Argentina), Dr. Roberto Pinotti (Italy), Dr.-Willy Smith (South America), Jean-Jacques Velasco (France), and Jun-ichi Yaoi (Japan). They will provide the symposium attendees with a comprehensive \"world view\" of ufology .on a scale that has never before been attempted. The tentative schedule for the symposium is as follows: Friday evening reception; Saturday morning - welcoming remarks and International speakers; Saturday afternoon - invited or contributed papers; Saturday evening - banquet with speaker; Saturday night - Panel discussion of the Abduction Phenomenon; Sunday morning - MUFON Corporate meeting and contributed papers; Sunday afternoon - International speakers and a closing panel discussion. Although a major portion of the symposium will be presentations by the international lecturers, another important segment will consist of-the invited papers and panel discussions. They will cover a variety of subjects, ranging from technical details of individual UFO sightings to statistical analyses of a large number of sightings. Also to be discussed in depth will be research into abduction reports and U.S. government cover-up (F.O.I.A.). A comprehensive discussion of newly acquired information and its implications will be provided by such experts as William L. Moore, Stanton T. Friedman, and Dr. Bruce S. Maccabee. The latest abduction research will be discussed by Budd Hopkins, author of Missing Time and Intruders; Whitley Strieber; author of Communion; and others. Since most of the new information on government cover-up and abductions has been available only to researchers in the U.S.A., the international represent- atives present will carry this information back to their own countries. Bruce Maccabee, the host chairman of the Fund for UFO Research, has provided the following prices for each event: Symposium fee for all sessions, including the Friday evening reception - $30 per person ($35 if received after June 1). The price of the banquet and speaker Saturday evening is $20. The on-campus housing (dormitory style) rate per night is $27 for a single room and double rooms are $25 per person. All speakers will be residing at American University. If you do not wish on-campus housing there are also hotels and motels within a short driving distance of American University, The closest motels are: Days Inn, 4400 Connecticut Ave., N.W., Washington, D.C. 20008 (202/244-5600), convenient to Tenleytown Metro (subway) stop on Red Line to downtown Washington, D.C.; and Holiday Inn, 5520 Wisconsin Ave., Chevy Chase, MD (301/656- 1500),' convenient to Friendship Heights Metro stop on Red Line. Individuals desiring off-campus housing must make their own reservations'. Cab fare from Washington National Airport to American University or the motels is approximately $10 - $12 and. from Union Station $5 - $6.

Dr. Kenneth Ring, a psychologist at the University of Connecticut, reported on his study of 111 NDE experiences, while researcher Lorraine Davis of John F. Kennedy University of Orinda, California interviewed 93 UFO sighters. Davis claims that 53% of those who saw UFOs became more psychic after the event. Post-event personality changes are apparently much the same in both groups of percipients. British writer Peter A. Hough discusses the controversy over the early UFO book, FLYING SAUCER (continued on page 17) 13"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"SIGHTING COEFFICIENT By Don Berliner Don Berliner is an aviation and science writer who lives in Alexandria, Virginia. It's truly an. embarrassment of riches. We have tens of thousands of UFO reports clogging our files...and we .don't know exactly what to do with them. So we stack them into piles and announce that the mere height of the piles establishes the significance of the subject. But does it? Does the possession of thousands of reports of funny-acting lights in the night sky prove anything at all? Beyond that, does it justify the effort that goes into collecting and investigating hundreds of additional reports of lights that don't act like anything known? Have we learned anything of value from all this effort? If the UFO mystery consisted of nothing but zig-zagging points of light, would we be involved in what appears to be a very important matter? It's entertaining, to be sure. And it makes us feel like we're doing something constructive. But the usefulness of such activity in reducing the mysteriousness of UFOs is highly questionable. Most UFO reports wouldn't lead to any progress even if every single available fact could be pinned down with near-certainty. There just isn't any way to learn much from the sighting of a light that jumps around the sky. It isn't a star or planet; it isn't an airplane or a helicopter; it isn't a meteor. But beyond that, what can be said? Once we have eliminated all manner of known phenomena, the original questions remain. In order to concentrate our severely limited resources (time, money, technical know-how, experience) on those reports possessing the potential for adding to our knowledge of UFOs, some system of establishing the relative usefulness of a report is needed. For decades we have been far too unscientific about 14 judging the merits of reports, and this has led to a great waste of effort. The late J. Allen Hy nek was .on the right track when he looked at UFO reports in terms of their \"strangeness\" and \"credibility\". If a report does not rate highly in both these characteristics, it isn't worth bothering about: It must be 'both highly unusual and highly reliable if it is to be useful. If it lacks either of these characteristics, it will never be of any value in learning about UFOs or in communicating the essence of the problem to those outside the UFO community who may be able to do something if presented with information they can believe and which is so unusual that conventional explanations are obviously inappropriate. In order to make the Hynek \"Strangeness/Credibility\" concept suitable for everyday use, I propose quantifying it: Using a simple O-to-10 point scale, any report can be graded. And by multiplying the two numbers, the report can be given a K/U (coefficient of usefulness) which will establish its potential for helping to solve the mystery, relative to other reports. While differences of opinion are sure to arise about the awarding of points for the varying degrees of strangeness and credibility, they will probably be in the range of one-to-two points, and thus of little significance. A case that clearly .is better than others will score high, while one that is obviously of marginal utility will rate low. I submit the following as a system which will allow us to concentrate our efforts on those reports which may contain information of long-term value, while setting aside reports that are worth no more than a shrug of the shoulders. STRANGENESS SCALE 0 — Identified as a known object or phenomena, or a report lacking a clear UFO content 1 — Night light with no apparent object , 2 — Night object 3 — Daylight object seen at a distance 4 — Night Close Encounter of the First Kind 5 — Daylight CE-I 6 — Ambiguous CE-II 7 — Unambiguous CE-II 8 - CE-III 9 — CE-III with occupant reaction to the .witness 10 — CE-III with meaningful communication CREDIBILITY SCALE 0 — Witnesses lacking believability 1 — Single average witness 2 — Multiple average witnesses 3 — Single exceptional witness 4 — Multiple exceptional witnesses 5 — Radar/visual 6 — Still photos shot by amateurs 7 — Still photos shot by professionals 8 — Amateur movies or videotape 9 — Professional movies or videotape 10 — Live television The test of any new idea is how well it works. By applying this K/U scale to well known reports, some idea of its value can be established. The best that can be scored by one of the funny, meandering lights in the night sky referred to so negatively at the start would be \"10\" out of a possible 100. The highest score by any report we considered was \"27\" for the Socorro, N. Mex., landing-with-occupants case of 1964. This seems to make it clear that there is a severe lack of reports which could be used to convince scientists, (continued on page 17)"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"AMAZING STORIES By Jay Fischer Jay Fischer is a MUFON member living in North Carolina. It's been forty years since the late Kennth Arnold made his historic sighting of nine, crescent-shaped UFOs : near Mt. Rainier, Washington. From the start, science fiction and ufology became opponents, hostility increasing i between the two fields every time the ( subject came up. This seems strange to many people, and understandably so, for the possibility of alien beings visiting Earth is as science fictional a concept as imaginable. Thus, a brief examination of why those interested in the two subjects generally dislike each other so strongly. Mr. Arnold's sighting occurred on June 24th, 1947, ushering in the modern phase of ufology, although reports of various UFO-like phenomena can be traced back many centuries. Once the story made the. press-wires, world-wide interest was sparked in so : called \"flying saucers.\" Subsequently, reports of objects much like those described by Arnold began coming in, plus several which had occurred before his sighting made print. \"FATE\" Arnold wanted to publish a personal account of his sighting, dis- satisfied with press versions, and so began looking for a publisher. He was turned away by larger publishers, however, for they wanted no part of such \"bunk.\" It was nearly a year before his account of his sighting appeared in the first issue of Fate magazine, dated Spring, 1948. Fate, devoted to accounts of all sorts of unusual or unexplainable phenomena, was founded by Curtis Fuller and the late Raymond Palmer, with Palmer as editor. He had • edited the pulp- magazine Amazing Sfon'es and Fantastic Adventures, both specializing in science fiction, for some years previously. We shall see later that Palmer's association with UFOs in the earliest days had tremendous impact on the field. It also had great effect on the relationship between UFOs and sf. In the late 1940's, science fiction was still mostly within the pulp realm, fighting for respectability. The sudden arrival of atomic bombs (sudden to non- sf fans, at least) had given a considerable boost to sfs battle for acceptance as serious literature. UFOs appeared to be a roadblock to that goal, and weren't welcomed with either enthusiasm or open minds on sfs behalf. Sadly, that situation has persisted to the present, and one reason for that will become apparent after considering the following. SHAVER We return to Ray Palmer again, when'he was still editing science fiction. His magazines had begun to lose readers in the mid:1940s, and Palmer sought a suitable gimmick to boost their circulation. He found it in the erroneously-titled \"Shaver Mystery.\" The \"mystery\" was the brain-child of the late Richard Shaver, starting with \"I Remember Lemuria,\" in the March, 1945 issue of Amazing Stories. The Shaver series concerned an ancient race of beings who ruled Earth until driven away by deadly changes in the sun's radiation. They left behind robots called \"deros,\" operating from vast underground caverns, which caused all sorts of trouble for mankind. All this seemed like simply another lurid pulp-fantasy, but the twist was that Shaver and Palmer presented it as fact! The series brought massive response, for a pulp magazine, anyway, and Palmer continued it for the tenure of his editorship at Amazing. Eventually, it reached the point where the \"deros\" were blamed for all the world's ills, including evil itself. When Arnold's sighting made UFOs a topic of interest, Palmer wove them , into Shaver's \"mystery,\" claiming they originated underground, and were piloted by \"derps!\" Naturally, the reasonably intelligent sf fans weren't amused. They became very angry with Palmer, ostracising him from the main stream science-fiction community. Palmer began another sf magazine in 1949, \"Other Worlds,\" in which.he continued to publish the material for a time, until interest waned, when he finally phased it out. Still, it should be noted that interest in the Shaver \"Mystery\" didn't vanish completely for some years. Palmer changed Other Worlds into a magazine devoted to ufology's \"lunatic fringe\" in 1957, often promoting the theory that UFOs came from underground', through holes at the north and south poles! He also published a limited- circulation magazine, The Hidden World, in the early 1960's, which reprinted all the previously-published Shaver material in about sixteen issues. Palmer's 1957 transformation of Other Worlds into Flying Saucers in 1957 effectively removed him from both sf and ufology, much to the relief of both parties. The point I'm making by discussing Shaver's bizarre theories (which he apparently believed to be true), is this: Ray Palmer's well-deserved reputation for sensationalism caused sf fans to understandably suspect UFOs to be another publicity stunt. It's possible that if Arnold had been able to find a more respectable publisher, the relationship between sf and the UFO phenomenon would have been much friendlier, over the years. So it really isn't too surprising that sf fans and UFO proponents began as antagonists. What is surprising is that the hostility has continued for so long. How can so many sf addicts continue to believe UFOs are nothing more than a (continued next page) 15"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"AMAZING, Continued hoax concocted by Palmer and Arnold, considering the enormous amount of evidence amassed over the years? Their attitude amounts, at best, to an arrogant refusal to face facts, and at worst, to intellectual bigotry. Such UFO chauvinism can't be hidden forever by depending on the excesses of a man connected with ufolpgy's earliest earliest days. A moment's consideration should convince any thinking person that the UFO phenomenon is far too wide-spread to be a hoax, especially one 40 years old. Science fiction has often been praised for its prophetic predictions of advances in the various sciences. I predict ufology will eventually prove to be an area in which sf will look foolish for having ignored the obvious. In that respect, at least, it will have plenty of company. HOLLY?, Continued this comes as unsettling news to the \"scientific students\" of UFOs. Believe me, this will also come as unsettling news to Christian scholars, when and if they will relax their defenses enough to examine the evidence. I have a suggestion for readers of the MUFON UFO JOURNAL. I know many of you are frustrated with knocking on the door of government, and of science, and saying, \"Hey, look at what is happening,\" only to have the door slammed shut. I suggest you knock on the door of your pastor, priest, or rabbi. Give him or her a copy of Whitley Strieber's book, Communion, talk about MUFON, about government secrecy concerning UFOs, and about possible religious implications concerning UFOs. As background on UFOs and the biblical religion, I recommend my articles in The Encyclopedia of,UFOs (Ed. Ronald D. Story), \"Angels, Biblical,\" \"Biblical UFO Sightings,\" \"Demonic Theory of UFOs,\" and \"Religion and UFOs.\" Another door may be shut in your face. But at least knock. 16 THE NIGHT SKY By Walter N, Webb MUFON Astronomy Consultant APRIL 1987 Bright Planets (Evening Sky): Mars, slowly fading to magnitude +1.6 in Taurus, slides past the Pleiades star cluster on the 4th and 5th. Don't mistake the nearby \"eye of the Bull\" Aldebaran (orange color) for the planet. Mars lies in the western sky, setting about 11 PM daylight time in midmonth. The ruddy world can be seen above the crescent Moon on both April 1 and 30. Saturn, at magnitude +0.2 in Ophiuchus, rises in the ESE before midnight in . mid-April and an hour earlier by month's end. Bright Planets (Morning Sky): . Venus, a brilliant magnitude -3.9 in midmonth, rises only about one hour before sunrise and is very low in the east during twilight. The planet will be occulted (hidden) by the crescent Moon on the 25th, an event worth trying to see; stars or planets that bright are rarely occulted. The show takes place before sunrise in the Midwest but after sunup from the Northeast. Skywatchers should employ both the naked eye and optical aid to best observe the display. Local daylight times of disappearance (D) and reappearance (R) for several cities follow: Austin, 6:09 (R); Chicago, 5:29 (D) and 6:35 (R); Atlanta, 6:14 (D) and 7:22 (R); Miami, 6:01 (D) and 7:07 (R); Boston, 6:36 (D) and 7:51 (R). Venus vanishes behind the bright crescent and later emerges on the opposite dark limb. Northeast observers should locate the Moon and Venus before sunrise and then follow the pair with binoculars or telescopes after the Sun comes up. Jupiter, shining at magnitude -2.1 in Pisces, becomes visible again low in the east late in April to the lower left of Venus. But it rises then only about three- quarters of an hour before sunrise. Saturn has moved to the south by dawn. Meteor Shower: The annual Lyrids, radiating from a point SW of Vega in the constellation Lyra, peaks on the morning of the 22nd at a rate of about 15 meteors per hour. A fat crescent Moon will interfere somewhat after 3:30 AM daylight time. The shower's radiant reaches its highest overhead at dawn. The Lyrids are bright, white and swift, often leaving glowing \"trains\" in their wake.

Mr. Kinder is relying upon the testimony of these scientists to support his book, because the honesty and integrity of Eduard \"Billy\" Meier is practically nil.

Webb MUFON Astronomy Consultant MAY 1987 Bright Planets (Evening Sky): Mars, still fading in Taurus, glows reddish in the west and sets about 10:30 PM daylight time in mid-May. Saturn, retrograding westward in Ophiuchus, is brightening toward a June opposition. It shines at magnitude +0.1. In midmonth the ringed planet rises in the ESE about 9:45 PM. Bright Planets (Morning Sky): Venus still rises about one hour before the Sun and remains very low in the east. Its magnitude is -3.9. During the first week of May Venus and Jupiter come within 1° of each other, although the pair will be difficult to see. Jupiter, shining at magnitude -2.1 in Pisces, remains very low in the east not far from Venus. The giant world rises about 4 AM daylight time in midmonth. Saturn has advanced to the SW by dawn. Meteor Shower: The radiant point of the May Aquarids rises about 2:30 AM on May 4 and 5, and thereafter for a few hours look for the swift meteors to dart out of the east across the morning sky. They have a rate of about 20 per hour. The farther south you are, the higher the radiant and the more Aquarids can be glimpsed.
