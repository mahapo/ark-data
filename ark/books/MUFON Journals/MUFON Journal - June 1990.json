More importantly, if less likely, they should then pay particular atten- tion to what Vallee has to say about card-carrying ufologists. It is not always pretty reading. In fact, the author of Passport to Magonia, Messengers of Deception and last year's Dimensions, ups the UFO stakes considerably with Con- frontations, sure to be considered controversial and cantankerous both within and without the limited popula- tion of \"professional\" believers and in- vestigators who self-style themselves ufologists. Vallee confronts potential readers on at least three levels. First, he challenges the scientific community to disregard the sensational aura that surrounds the subject and to serious- ly consider the available evidence on its own terms, audacious and seem- ingly absurd as it often is. Secondly, he takes specific aim at ufologists themselves, asserting often and without mincing his message that, more often than not, the first ama- teurs on the scene generally prove to be part of the problem, rather than the solution, a situation exacerbated by the headlong rush to haul in a hyp- notist, frequently an unlicensed dab- bler as well, whenever the situation seems to even remotely require it. The damage done to the case itself, Vallee charges, not to mention the possible psychological harm to abductees and other witnesses, is sometimes ir- reparable as well as always uncon- scionable. The professional organizations don't always fare well under Vallee's baleful glare, either. In fact, he com- pares the current situation to an earlier episode in civilian ufology when Key- hoe and NICAP routinely ignored humanoid reports because they didn't fit the acceptable model of the phe- nomenon then common. (Apparent- ly, it was okay in the Fifties to say fly- ing saucers were flown by aliens, just as long as you didn't see any actual pilots on the ground or in close proximity.) Vallee argues that a similar form of censorship, whether subconscious or otherwise, is imposed today by the predominance of the Extraterrestrial Hypothesis. Rather than explaining the UFO phenomenon, he says, the ETH simply tends to obscure the ac- tual nature of the subject, rather like a dark cloud passing in front of the sun. Data that confront or reject the ETH are simply ignored or thrown out with the bath water, where they vanish down the drain. To paraphrase Charles Fort, the \"Damned\" these days include obvious parallels in close encounter and abduction cases with folklore of the little people, paranor- mal phenomena (poltergeists, 'super- natural' assaults, and so on), and a much wider variety of alien \"humanoids\" and creatures being reported than the one or two types generally presumed to dominate. The persistence of physical-injury cases is another \"damned datum\" that tends to get swept under the rug of contem- porary ufology. Vallee's third confrontation is with the UFO phenomenon itself, grown more ominous and apparently mean- spirited (or simply indifferent) than some would have us believe. By this point, the average reader may well wonder whether Vallee, the mild- mannered Gaul, has finally been John Keel-hauled or what? Actually, he bases such assertions on his own extensive on-site investigations in the Brazilian outback, where a series of sightings involving refrigerator-sized UFOs beaming light rays, resulting in bum-marks and possible fatalities, has erupted over the last decade. Much of this particular portion of the book was originally previewed at Vallee's talk before last summer's MUFON Symposium in Las Vegas. While considerably raising the UFO ante, however, Vallee admits he has no easy trump cards slipped up his sleeves. Essentially, to my way of thinking, at least, his lack of easy answers is what Confrontations is all about, and in an ideal world, what ufology itself should be all about. I have my disagreements with Vallee, too, but he still strikes me as one of the few thinkers in the field actually investigating the phenomenon (a) in an effort to eventually reach conclu- sions, rather than trying to find more \"facts\" to fit in the extraterrestrial pigeonhole. Mundane Magic It's not so much a question of whether the ETH is absurb itself, as much as a situation in which so much of the data used to support the hypothesis itself is inherently absurd. The typical image of alien interven- tion that emerges is more akin to the Gang That Couldn't Shoot Straight than it is to harbingers of advanced science. The aliens swirl through our skies with impunity on one hand, crash and burn just like a commercial airliner on another. They can pass through walls like ghosts, or stop cars on a lonely isolated road in the mid- dle of the night, physically abducting the occupants. And to what end? To perform the same technologically out- moded physical examination and genetic extractions? Presumably, they could abduct us at will, without anyone ever being the wiser, yet they don't.

Like Vallee, I'll be disap- pointed if UFOs turn out to be only extraterrestrial spacecraft. In the meantime, I get the distinct impression that Vallee is losing pa- tience with his perceived role in the UFO \"community\" which is that of being perpetually sniped at as the bearer of bad news. Confron- tations is Vallee's latest argument for looking at the data and not the car- rier, the content and not the con- tainer. You may not like what I have to say, writes Vallee, but youd be bet- ter off aiming at UFOs than the author. Orange Balls of Light By Greg Long In 1981 I launched a sustained, long-term study of sightings of UFOs on the Yakima Indian Reservation in south-central Washington state. I was drawn to the Reservation because of Bill Vogel's serious, decade-long ef- fort of documenting the mystery there. (Vogel was the Chief Fire Con- trol Officer for 30 years; he died in Spring 1985.) The 1.25-million-acre Reservation lies at the eastern foothills of the Cascade Mountains. Kenneth Arnold observed nine flying objects on June 24, 1947, just northwest of the Reser- vation, while flying near Mount Rainier in search of a downed military transport plane. The metallic-appearing objects were hurtling southward above the backbone of the majestic Cascades. They disappeared just beyond Mount Adams at the Reservation's far southwestern boundary. 1 discovered when working with Vogel's reports, and during my many interviews of Reservation witnesses, that the predominant UFO seen and photographed on the Reservation was an orange sphere (or ball) of light. These very luminous, burning spheres (some also yellow, white or red) were observed hovering or moving slowly above or along ridges, hills or buttes. Soon I discovered that Harley Rutledge had observed similar balls of light from 1973 to 1981 in the Pied- mont area of southeast Missouri. Eventually my research uncovered similar sightings of these balls of light (BOLs) in other areas around the United States. For example, the classic book, The Utah UFO Display, by Frank Salisbury, documents many orange BOL sightings. Interestingly, almost every Allied pilot of World War II who reported a \"foo fighter\" describ- ed it as an orange sphere. Most recent- ly, orange spheres have appeared in the night skies of Ashdown/Foreman, Arkansas and Wytheville, Virginia, during highly publicized flaps in Fall 1987 and Winter 1988. These well- investigated cases of orange spheres confirm the existence of this particular type of UFO. Ball Lightning? What are they? The question is best asked within the context of the cen- tral debate of the UFO mystery: Specifically, are the BOLs an alien technology (an aerial craft), or a natural phenomenon akin to plasmas or ball lightning? The latter supposi- tion is a fair one, considering the similarities of BOLs to ball lightning: the spherical or globular shape, the orange, red or white colors and the often-reported low altitude. Yet in contrast, BOLs are large — if apparent size estimates provided by witnesses can be trusted. And clear- ly the Yakima BOLs were seen in dry, quiet weather many miles away (up to 60 miles in some cases). Ball light- ning favors thunderstorms. Even at great distances, and while measuring many feet in diameter, BOLs fail to demonstrate the characteris- tics of manmade or common natural atmospheric and astronomical phenomena. In addition to ball lightning, my research has pinpointed these most common BOL \"impostors\" (or Iden- tified Flying Objects): • The moon. • Military flares. • Burning plastic balloons. • Meteors (typically short-lived and describing long, high trajectories). • White aircraft landing and take- off lights modified to orange or amber \"ball\" shapes through haze and other optical distortion (landing lights always appear fuzzy and ragged, unlike the clean, well-defined edges of true BOLs). MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 266 June 1990"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Once I extracted these IFOs from a mass of report summaries, an in- teresting dimension of the puzzle arose: What are orange BOLs doing amid reports (emanating from the same locale) of other nocturnal lights, Sasquatch (Bigfoot) reports, sightings of structured craftlike objects, CEHIs and abductions? Stan Gordon of Pennsylvania stated that in the early 1970s he received reports of Sasquatch in the vicinity of or during the same general timeframe of aerial orange BOLs. On the Yakima Indian Reservation, Vogel found himself too busy with UFOs to pursue the many local Sasquatch reports that came his way once Reser- vation citizens discovered he was the local investigator of strange phenomena. Ubiquitous BOLs Daylight Discs and decidedly solid- appearing objects displaying classic rapid ascents and descents, high speed and intelligent-seeming maneuvering and control were also reported on the Reservation. Rut- ledge documents similar-behaving ob- jects among the mostly nocturnal-light UFOs in Piedmont, Missouri. In Wytheville, Virginia, local investigator Danny Gordon has seen both large, definite-appearing craft as well as orange spheres. Why were orange spheres seen during cattle mutilations in 1975-76 in Colorado? And Eddie Bullard reports that, although a very small percentage, abductees have reported orange UFOs right before a missing time experience. (Budd Hopkins alludes to the presence of an orange UFO in both Missing Time and Intruders.) Is there a clue to the root of the UFO mystery in this particular, oft- repeating UFO: the orange BOL and other orange UFOs with curved shapes — orange ovals, classic \"saucers,\" discs? I quote from a letter received from a European in- vestigator: \"... 1 could not even im- agine I would ever get to see so many of these orange objects through the years, and neither could I imagine the Interestingly, almost every Allied pilot of World War II who reported a \"foo fighter\" described it as an orange sphere. large percentage of photographs of orange objects that I would keep in my personal files.\" The orange BOLs are everywhere. In fact, their pattern runs so strongly through the UFO literature and UFO reporting channels, that they deserve closer scrutiny. Could there be several classes of balls of light with completely different physical sources which overlap only on the basis of shape? I have come across a few cases of orange \"balls\" or orange \"ovals\" that upon close approach \"resolve\" {the witness detects clear, sharp detail) into decidedly structured-appearing aerial machines. The orange appearance may be purely a byproduct of the pro- pulsion system and effects of energy on atmospheric gases. Do these orange spheres perform a particular operational function if they are a technological device? Or could the orange BOLs actually be natural plasma forms, or Unidentified At- mospheric Phenomena? Curiously, the Pulaski fault runs through Wytheville Virginia. Curiously, in November 1987 during the local flap there, a low level quake struck Carroll County. (Days before this quake, Gordon and friend Roger Hall sighted a yellow ball of light near Sand Mountain.) Red Herrings Either the orange spheres are a natural, technically derived phenom- enon, the startling presence of which triggers misinterpretation by local viewers of manmade and astro- nomical bodies; in which case we must trot out the hoary \"hysteria\" and \"mass delusion\" hypotheses to ac- count for the craft that appear \"mixed up\" with the natural, correctly viewed and accurately reported orange spheres. Or the orange spheres are one of the many different types of true UFOs; or one manifestation of many different manifestations of which the UFO phenomenon is capable. Or finally — and I toss out this hypothesis as a wild idea — the orange spheres are an intelligence, capable of know- ing the work of UFO researchers and of appearing in faulted, earthquake- prone areas during periods of tectonic strain buildup and release, as a red herring, while other UFOs carry out their operations. In effect, orange spheres muddy the waters, and exploit natural phenomena to mask their con- tinual project of surveillance, display, approach and abduction. Why are there two distinct cate- gories of BOLs: \"small\" ones and \"large\" ones? The small ones are those several inches to a foot or so in diameter, and seem to function (some speculate) as monitoring or sur- veillance devices. The large BOLs are typically seen at some distance (thousands of feet to miles), and sug- gest either a classic glowing UFO craft or a natural plasma. M ore work is required. To this end, I turn to serious UFO investi- gators and research- ers. I am seeking photographic evidence; high quality reports from in- vestigative files; newsclippings; and other source material documenting the orange sphere. Most important, wherever possible, are multiple reports from one limited sighting area. This should include reference to other sightings of other objects from the same area. In this way, I can test the hypothesis that non-orange BOLs are misinterpretations of other natural and manmade objects. Also, a large enough data base can serve to test any geophysical theory of UFOs. I am committed to a systematic, controlled evaluation of BOL reports in the UFO literature. There is some evidence, although slight, that any \"intelligence\" imputed to some BOLs is purely anthropomorphic. On the other hand, there is evidence of a Continued on page 7 MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 266 June 1990"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Black Holes and Robert Lazar By Erich A. Aggen, Jr. Author Aggen is a MUFON State Section Director, who lives in Kan- sas City, Missouri. One of the more interesting figures to surface recently in the field of UFO investigations is one Robert Lazar. If Mr. Lazar is not a deliberate agent of disinformation, then what he has to say should at least be seriously ex- amined. He purports to be a physicist who at one time worked at Los Alamos National Laboratory. Lazar was later hired as a senior staff physicist at \"Area S-4\" for what he was told was the United States Navy. He reportedly obtained the job through a company or agency called \"EG & G.\" Area S-4 is located about 10 to 15 miles south of Groom Lake, which is about 125 miles north of Las Vegas. Lazar's work at this secret site allegedly involved the reverse en- gineering of certain alien technology, in particular, a functioning gravitation- al propulsion \"motor.\" Most of this in- formation came to light in an inter- view conducted by George Knapp, producer and host of a program called \"On the Record\" for KLAS-TV in Las Vegas, Nevada. The program first aired in December of last year. In the interview Mr. Lazar described the alien propulsion system as an anti- matter reactor wherein element 115 is bombarded with protons and re- leases anti-matter particles which react with any type of matter. Once a chip of 115 is introduced into the system a powerful local gravitational field is automatically produced. Element 115, the fuel or triggering component of the gravitational motor, is a super-heavy element not found on Earth. It cannot be manufactured by Earth science. It can only occur in regions of space where huge amounts of mass and energy reactions have taken place. Such regions would in- clude locations around binary star systems and the outer zone of a supernova, according to Mr. Lazar. Mr. Lazar indicated that the grav- ity motor converts matter to energy with one hundred percent efficiency, compared to eight-tenths of one per- cent conversion for fission and fusion reactions thus far produced by ter- restrial science. The reaction inside the motor produces heat as a by-product which is then converted by a ther- mionic generator into electricity, also at one hundred percent efficiency. In operation, the motor creates a gravitational wave which is siphoned off by a \"wave guide\" and then directed above the top of the craft to the bottom where three gravity amplifiers magnify and direct or \"aim\" the gravity wave. By creating its own gravity the motor distorts time and space. The three gravity amplifiers at the bottom of the craft lock on to a focal point or destination and pull that point to the craft as a result of space and time distortion. 4 ' 8 * In effect, distance is reduced to zero and speed is increased to infinity. Travel, for all intents and purposes, is instantaneous between any two points anywhere in space. 8 Black Holes During one demonstration of the motor an intense gravitational area was created and a small black disc was formed in space caused by the bend- ing of light. In some respects the small black disc resembled a \"black hole\" Mr. Lazar noted that the analogy was bad, but essentially correct. 8 What is the significance of the small \"black hole\" produced during the demonstration? Is it indicative of the method or means by which space and time are distorted and transcended? In 1935, Albert Einstein and Nathan Rosen published a paper predicting the existence of a cor- ridor or passage directly connecting one part of the universe to another as part of a black hole-white hole system. This was called the Einstein- Rosen Bridge or \"ER\" Bridge for short. ER Bridges are also called \"wormholes.\" 9 - I0 The only black holes we know about are those on a astronomical scale. A black hole is the burned-out shell of a star at least three times larger in mass than our own sun. Less massive stars usually burnout as ex- ploding supernovae. Their gravity is not strong enough to compress them into a black hole. 2 A black hole or ER bridge is a hole in space-time where all conventional rules break down. Time \"stops\" com- pletely at the \"event horizon\" (boun- dary) of a black hole. Matter is sucked in and vanishes from this part of the universe. 4 7 Physicists have calculated that for a black hole to be useful as a method of interstellar travel it would require the compressed mass of a star about the size of our sun. This, of course, is a physical impossibility. A star the size of our sun possesses insufficient mass to compress itself into a black hole. Such a black hole could only be produced artificially. 2 A spacecraft entering a black hole would transcend both time and space in no more than a millionth of a se- cond or almost instantly. The next best thing to teleportation! 2 If the alien gravitational motor somehow creates its own black hole to \"fall\" through, the energy required is rather mind-boggling — at least equivalent to the compressed mass and gravity of our own sun! 9 Of course, the possibility exists that the aliens have found a more energy- efficient way to achieve the same result. U.S. Air Force The United States Air Force also seems to be interested in the possibilities of utilizing antimatter for MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 266 June 1990"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"propulsion. In August of 1986, a curious reference to antimatter pro- pulsion appeared in Air Force Magazine in an article entitled, \"USAF in the Twenty-first Century,\" by James W. Canan, Senior Editor. The Air Force Space Division's General McCartney stated that \"exciting\" work based on the Air Force's Project Forecast II was planned for SD's Rocket Propulsion Laboratory on various types of high-energy, high- density chemical propellants. \"But even those fuels pale in com- parison to something farther out that's known as antimatter,\" the General stated. The article went on to state that antimatter research is synony- mous with \"antiprotons.\" In such an antimatter propulsion system nega- tively charged hydrogen particles (an- tiprotons) would be combined with positively charged hydrogen protons. The particles would annihilate each other and produce enormous amounts of energy. Milligrams of an- tiprotons stored in magnetic contain- ment \"bottles\" could replace tons of chemical rocket fuel and eventually produce a propulsion system capable of reaching other stars. The Air Force expects to be pro- ducing one gram of antiproton \"fuel\" by the turn of the century, according to Aviation Week & Space Tech- nology (6/16/86). One might ask why the Air Force decided to finance research into such a \"far out\" propul- sion system. Was it because they already knew it would work? Since the appearance of a few short articles mentioning antimatter research in 1985 and 1986, both Aviation Week and Air Force Magazine have re- mained strangely silent on this subject. Although the Air Force proposes to utilize antimatter in a rather rudimen- tary fashion as the propellant in a con- ventional reaction propulsion system, the aliens obviously have progressed far beyond that point. An article in National Geographic, May 1989 addresses the various theories on gravity. Quoting from John Boslough's article: \" A force counterac- ting gravity? It's enough to get anybody's heart pumping,' says Paul Boynton. Think of the possibilities. If we could harness such a force, might we someday have craneless construc- tion, cableless elevators, or spaceships zipping between planets on \"hyper- drive\" that engages the fifth force lock- ed within subatomic particles^ As you might expect, none ot this has escaped the notice of the U.S. Government, especially the Pentagon. \"Exotic and expensive research aimed at pinning down the new force is already in the works. Physicists from the Los Alamos National Laboratory have joined with Italian physicists to find out if a fifth force would have an effect on antimatter. {Antimatter is material identical in mass but opposite in electrical charge from ordinary mat- ter. Upon meeting, the two annihilate themselves in a violent burst of energy.)\" 15 From what Mr. Lazar has reported, the aliens must possess and control staggering amounts of energy — almost infinite in scope compared to terrestrial capabilities As described by Mr. Lazar, element 115 has the uni- que property ot releasing antimatter particles when subjected to proton bombardment. It also has self-evident weapons potential — 1 kilogram (2.2 pounds) is equal in energy to 24 20 megaton hydrogen bombs or nearly half a billion tons of TNT! Such an amount of element 115 would be no larger than a small apple. 8 Sometimes reality is stranger than fiction. In the classic science fiction film \"The Day The Earth Stood Still\" Klaatu issues an ultimatum to the people of Earth in which he declares that \"... if you threaten to extend your violence this Earth of yours will be reduced to a bumed-out cinder.\" That the aliens literally have such planet obliterating power at their fingertips is sobering to contemplate. That they have not used this awesome power is a testament to their constraint and perhaps their sense of morality. References 1. Abell, George. Exploration of the Universe.

It was published in Rabochaya Tribuna on April 19, 1990 and translated by FBIS (Foreign Broadcast Informa- tion Service) Foreign Press Notice. Incident occurred on March 21, 1990. General of Aviation Igor Maltsev, chief of the main staff of Air Defense Forces, as reported in Rabochaya Tribuna, April 19, 1990: \"I am not a specialist on UFOs and, therefore, I can only correlate the data and express my own supposition. Ac- cording to the evidence of these eyewitnesses, the UFO is a disk with a diameter from 100 to 200 meters. Two pulsating lights were positioned on its sides. When the object flew in a horizontal plane, the line of the lights was parallel to the horizon. During vertical movement it rotated and was perpendicular to the ground. Moreover, the object rotated around its axis and performed an \"S-turn\" flight, both in the horizontal and ver- tical planes. Next, the UFO hovered above the ground and then flew with speed exceeding that of the modern jet fighter by two or three times. All of the observers noticed that the flight speed was directly related to the flashing of the side lights: the more often they flashed, t^e higher the speed. \"The objects flew at altitudes rang- ing from 1000 to 7000 meters. The movement of the UFOs was not ac- companied by sound of any kind and was distinguished by its startling maneuverability. It seemed that the UFOs were completely devoid of in- ertia. In other words, they had somehow 'come to terms' with gravi- ty. At the present time, terrestrial machines could hardly have any such capabilities. The object was observed as a 'pip' from a radar target on the screens of aircraft radar sights, and on the screens of several electronic surveillance sub-units. One station did not establish an observation.\" Rabochaya Tribuna pointed out the General Maltsev's testimony was im- portant confirmation for claims that UFOs are piloted craft and contra- dicted suggestions that UFOs are at- mospheric phenomena. The news- paper also reproduced some of the supporting evidence provided by General Maltsev concerning an inci- dent on March 21, 1990, when radar detected an object flying near Pereslavl-Zalesskiy (75 miles NE of Moscow). An aviator reported: \"I, Lt. Colonel A. A. Semenchen- ko, received the command to go on an alert exercise. At 2138 hours, I received the command for take-off. In the air, in the region of Pereslavl, I received my task of detecting and identifying a target at an altitude of 2000 meters. I visually detected the target, designated by two flashing white lights, at 2205 hours. I was following a true course of 220 degrees, and it was ahead and to the right, at an angle of 10 degrees. The target altered its altitude by amounts ranging up to 1000 meters and changed its direction of flight. With the permission of the command post, I locked my sights onto the radiation after checking to be sure the weaponry was switched off. \"The target did not respond to the 'identify, friend or foe' request. In ad- dition to the target, three or four regularly scheduled airliners could be observed on the screen. As ordered by the command post, I carried out a banked turn. While completing the turn, I observed a luminous phenom- ena, reminiscent of the aurora borealis but with a weak intensity, to the north and northwest. I approached the tar- get to within about 500 to 600 meters. I passed above the target, trying to define its character. I observed only two bright flashing white lights. I brief- ly saw the silhouette of the target against the background of the il- luminated city. It was difficult to deter- mine its nature and classification due to the limited lighting \"At the order of the command post, I ended my mission and returned to the airfield. I landed with 700 liters of fuel still remaining: The weather in the region was 0-10. March 21, 1990.\" A radar observation post in the Pereslavl-Zalesskiy region: \"A shining object with red lights at an azimuth of 260-270 degrees and a range of about 40 kilometers, moving at a speed many times greater than that of aircraft, appeared at 2119 hours. A shining object with white lights and the same parameters was following it. At 2135 hours the object with the luminous red lights disappeared, while at an azimuth of 220 degrees and at an undetermined range. At 2140 hours there were alternate ap- pearances and disappearances of a second object with white lights at azimuth 270-250 degrees and a range of 40-100 kilometers. At 2150 hours there was a steady appearance and hovering of the object at an azimuth of 270 degrees. \"At 2155 hours the object disap- peared at an azimuth of 240 and a range of 40 kilometers. At 2157 hours the object appeared in the parameters indicated above. At 2159 hours there was an observation of an airplane at an azimuth of 250 degrees, a range of 30-50 kilometers, and a course of 330 degrees. The object is turning and, at a great speed, is approaching the airplane. After an approach to a distance of about 20 kilometers, the object disappears from the field of observation and appears again tp the rear and above the plane. The object is moving in an arc at azimuth 270. At 2201 hours, the object is hovering in place at an azimuth of 190-200 degrees and a range up to 100 kilometers. At 2203 hours a fighter MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 266 June 1990"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"aircraft appeared in the field of obser- vation at an azimuth of 240 degrees. While the fighter was approaching the object, the latter disappeared. At 2205 hours the object appeared at an azimuth of 190-220 degrees, hovered, and, after one-to-two minutes, disappeared.\" Captain V. Birin: \"The object looked like a flying saucer with two very bright lights along the edges. Its diameter was approximately 100-200 meters (judging by the shining lights). A less intense light, which looked like a porthole, could be seen between the two bright lights. After the object, the red light with the average intensity re- mained. The trajectory depended on the flashing of the bright side lights: the more often they flashed, the faster the speed of the UFO and vice ver- sa. While hovering, the object ex- tinguished its lights almost completely. At 2230 hours the object headed off in the direction of Moscow. I am enclosing a drawing of it.\" (note: drawing not available) Captain V. Ivchenko: \"1 could not make out the contours of the object, but I clearly saw two lights flashing with a definite periodicity. The il- lumination from these lights could be compared with a photoflash. The UFO was carrying out an 'S-turn' flight, gradually approaching our ci- ty; its route passed from east to west at an angle of sight of approximately 75 degrees relative to the town. I dis- tinguished two aircraft near the object. I am enclosing the approximate route of the UFO.\" (note: also not available.) Captain N. Filatov: \"To all visual perceptions, the object was rotating in a horizontal plane around its own axis, since the light sources merged and divided in turn. The magnitudes of the sources of radiation, with respect to power, intensity and luminous flux, were significantly greater than the signal lights of aircraft which were flying around in our region at that time. The periodicity of the luminescence of the lights of the UFO was two-to-three seconds. The object was located in the direction of Zagorsk. The trajectory of its move- ment was 'S-turn 1 , horizontally and vertically.\" Captain 1. Lapin: \"At 2200 hours, the flashing of the object vanished for five minutes. Then a sharp light flared up. The whole cloud was illuminated and, after that, the object appeared again. Two aircraft accompanied it. The aircraft had red identification lights. After decreasing its altitude, the object flew away in the direction of Moscow at great speed. It left a red luminescence of average intensity behind in the clouds. I observed the object until 2240 hours. I experienced no sensation whatsoever.\" According to Rabochaya Tribuna, the editors could only publish in this issue excerpts from a few of \"more than 100 visual observations\" com- piled by unit commanders and passed on to General Maltsev. Of course, UFOs are real. Of course, UFOs are abducting people. All of it is really going on. The ques- tion now is, just how bad is it? How many people have undergone the ter- rifying experience of being abducted? How many carry the physical and emotional scars of an alien en- counter? How many keep hidden these deepest and darkest of secrets? While the media and the scientific community cling to their skepticism like wreckage in a storm, abduction stories continue to mount. There are frightening hints that abductions may be quite common — much more common than usually thought. Are abductions widespread? That is the question this article will attempt to answer. The late J. Allen Hynek was un- doubtedly one of the world's best- known UFO investigators. In William Steinman's book, UFO Crash at One in Forty By Preston Dennett Aztec, a conversation between Paul Bennewitz and J. Allen Hynek is re- counted. When Hynek was asked how many people he thought have been abducted, Hynek allegedly replied without hesitation, \"about one out of forty.\" ' Whitley Strieber, the author of Communion and Transformation, is a strong believer that UFO encounters are common. In an interview with UFO Magazine, Strieber is quoted as saying, \"I will tell you this: there are a lot of people who have already had this experience — a lot more than even the UFO community realizes. I am now poring through something like 5000 letters — I often get 40 and 50 a day, even now. People again and again, write 'a friend of mine told me about you and now I can write and tell somebody what happened to me,' and it goes on and on. I don't know how many people have been involved with this, but I'm sure it's in the hun- dreds of thousands.\" 2 Budd Hopkins is one of the best- known investigators of UFO abduc- tions. He has also become convinced of the high frequency of UFO en- counters. In his book, Missing Time, Hopkins writes of the case of Steve Kilburn, who was abducted and left with no conscious memory of the event. Hopkins was astounded by this, and made the obvious conclu- sion. Says Hopkins, \"This opened up the possibility that the experience, whatever it was, had been suppressed in others, and that abduction was widespread.\" 3 Because Steve Kilburn had no recollection of the event, Hopkins concluded, \"This meant that almost anyone can have suffered such an ex- perience and yet be totally unaware of it for all practical purposes. What before was thought of as a rare event MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 266 June 1990"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"10 might be infinitely more common than anyone has supposed.\" 4 In Missing Time, Hopkins states, \"I have described UFO abductions as constituting an epidemic; in fact, we have no idea how many such kidnap- pings may already have taken place, but I believe there are vastly more than the two hundred or so incidents which have been investigated.\" 5 Because people generally don't report their experiences Hopkins states, \"We can logically theorize that there may be tens of thousands of Americans whose encounters have never been revealed.\" 6 Jacques Vallee is definitely a leading expert in the field of UFOs. Vallee is very skeptical of the extrater- restrial iheory, but he does take the position that UFO landings are quite common. Says Vallee, \"... the UFOs, if they are spacecraft engaged in a general survey of our planet, must have landed here no fewer than three million times in two decades.\" 7 Another famous figure in ufology, Dr. Leo Sprinkle, acknowledges the possibility that there may be \"hundreds of thousands\" of people who have been abducted and have no conscious memory of the experience\" 8 Rampant Epidemic? David Webb has asserted his belief that \"one out of eight\" UFO witnesses may have been abducted.\" 9 According to the 1973 Gallup poll, 15 million people believe they have seen UFOs. 10 If 15 million people have seen UFOs, and one out of every eight have been abducted, then one could conclude that 1,850,000 people have been abducted! When I heard all these statements, I was very skeptical. I could believe UFOs were real, but I wasn't ready to accept any rumors of a rampant epidemic. And yet the rumors have persisted. According to one source, 60 UFO sightings are reported across America everyday! \" I was initially skeptical of UFOs. But as my interest grew, I began asking all my friends and family if they had ever had any encounters. To my utter astonishment, I discovered that over one third of the people I knew had encountered a UFO. By a sort of in- formal survey, I uncovered over 50 UFO cases. I found out that I knew five people who had been abducted. All of this points to one thing: UFO encounters are quite common. Most abductee researchers agree that a vast number of people have been ab- ducted. Hopkins theorizes tens of thousands. Streiber theorizes hun- dreds of thousands. Hynek allegedly estimated one in forty. It is uncertain exactly how many people are abductees, but it should be evident that UFO encounters are by no means rare. I think it is safe to say that millions of people have been ab- ducted by UFOs. The invasion is oc- curring — here and now — all across our planet. References 1.

U nusual red lights seen in the skies over Gulf Breeze and Pensacola in recent weeks have prompted a minor controversy as to whether they can be explained by mundane phenomena, such as bal- loons or flares, or are un explain able, and hence possibly UFO related, Pen- sacola MUFON has been interviewing witnesses and investigating the phe- nomena since the onset and has not as yet arrived at a probable conclusion. At this point we deem it prudent and timely to share the information we have with the public. We have received more than one call from area residents who related that similar lights have been observed in the Ffensacola area for decades. Ships' cap- tains and crews have witnessed the phenomena for as far back as the turn of the century. Some find it humorous that we seem to get so excited over the events which many believe started on the evening of April 11, 1990. Investigators for Pensacola MUFON have received reports of other red, orange, white and even blue lights be- ing seen in the Pensacola area and elsewhere over the past few years. Most of these reports have not been ex- plainable by natural phenomena. The current excitement seems to have begun on the evening of April llth when several Gulf Breeze residents observed a red light traveling from NNE to SSW over Gulf Breeze and out into the Gulf of Mexico before MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 266 June 1990"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"11 winking out. Some witnesses who were at the Shoreline Park ball field related that they saw clusters of balloons associated with the light which led them to believe that the sighting that night was produced by man. Other experienced witnesses firmly believe that what they saw is unexplainable. The saga continued on Thursday, April 12, when at least two witnesses saw a very bright red light hovering to the south of Gulf Breeze over Lit- tle Sabine Island, The light hovered in one position for several minutes and then blinked out. Some of the same witnesses saw another light the following evening to the west of Gulf Breeze. It again hovered in one posi- tion for a few minutes before blink- ing out. These witnesses, who have knowledge of and experience with flares, are convinced that what they observed cannot be explained as man-made. At least five other witnesses reported seeing another red light on Friday, April 13, to the north of Gulf Breeze. It hovered in one spot for a few minutes, then shot up out of sight when an aircraft approached from the west. When the airplane passed the location, the red light reappeared and then shot straight up and vanished. This would seem to indicate that at least two of the red lights were in the area Friday night. On Saturday night, April 14, at least seven witnesses reported seeing a red light to the north of Gulf Breeze. It approached from the east on a westerly path at a very high speed — nearly the speed of sound. It suddenly stopped with almost instantaneous deceleration. It hovered in one spot for a brief time, moved back and forth a few times with the light pulsating, and then moved up, then out of sight. Another group of witnesses observed a second red light to the North of Gulf Breeze which just hovered in one location for a few minutes and then disappeared. A third red light was observed by a group of witnesses at the south end of the three-mile Pensacola Bay Bridge. This one approached from the WARNING Hoax \"UFO\" balloons being Hown near Gulf Breeze by un- known persons are an ILLEGAL HAZARD to civil and military air- craft, and thus to persons on the ground. If you have any information on the person(i) responsible for this illegal and potentially dangerous activity, please call: (2O2) 554-59O1 SSE, passed nearly over the bridge for a distance, and then moved away to the NE over East Bay where it blinked out. These accounts seem to indicate that there were at least three red lights in the area at about the same time. Witnesses have also reported sighting red lights in the area on Tues- day, April 17, and on Wednesday, April 18. It cannot be ignored that some of the above events may be hoaxes or pranks perpetrated by man, but most of us find it difficult to explain all of them that way. The multiple sightings, in different positions, at the same time and moving in different directions would have posed tough problems for a hoaxer. Attaining the very high speed in the one event would also have been difficult. If anyone has ad- ditional information to report on these events please contact MUFON Pen- sacola at (904) 436-2700. Associate Editor's note: On the evening of April 11, 1990, numerous witnesses attending a baseball game at South Shoreline Park in Gulf Breeze, Florida, observed and reported a red light supported by a cluster of party balloons moving with the wind from NNE to SSW, travel- ing out into the Gulf of Mexico before \"winking out.\" Obviously, this was a man-made prank intentionally manipulated to pass over a known audience at a scheduled baseball game. This charade sparked interest in later sightings during the month of April, reported in this news update by Rex Salisberry, which were not ex- plainable in conventional terms. An advertisement appeared in the Pensacola News Journal on April 28, 1990 after the reported series of sightings of red lights over Gulf Breeze in an apparent attempt to discredit the witnesses and investigators. (See reproduction of the ad in this article.) Some readers may recognize the tele- phone number as that of Philip J. Klass in Washington, DC. Two in- dependent telephone calls were made to this number by investigators-in which Mr. Klass admitted that he had placed the ad in the newspaper. He was attempting to build a case to pro- vide a prosaic explanation for all of the sightings in his own shrewd man- ner to fulfill his reputation as a self- appointed debunker. Nice try Phil — you failed again.

In- deed, in my latest FOIA lawsuit against the Federal Bureau of In- vestigation (in which the Bureau prevailed), I sought, in part, to have the Bureau account for its longstand- ing (and still extant) policy and prac- tice of spying upon the UFO-research activities and objectives of such re- searchers as William L. Moore, Leonard H. Stringfield, Stanton T. Friedman, and Larry W. Bryant — each of whom is favored with an F.B.I. dossier of varying degrees of public disclosure by the Bureau. Besides the Bureau and its cousin agency, the U.S. Air Force Office of Special Investigations, what other.ma- jor agency feels compelled to keep watch over UFO researchers? None other than the U.S. Central In- telligence Agency. With their history of behind-the- scenes involvement with the UFO problem dating back to the early Fif- ties, the C.I.A. UFO sleuths prefer to keep a low profile as regards their own UFO investigations. But when it comes to spying upon private \"UFOlogists,\" the Agency's profile sticks up like a periscope in the Washington Monument's reflecting pool. Case in point: Some years ago, 1 FOIA-re quested all C.I.A.-generated records pertaining to the Agency's 1965 initiative to acquire hard-core UFO-encounter reports from the now-defunct National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena. Later, that contact with former NICAP assistant director Richard H. Hall prompted him to FOIA-request a copy of any C.I.A. dossier being kept on him. At first, the Agency denied they had anything in their files on him. When he reminded them of their earlier response to me, they provided him a copy (heavily censored, of course) of what they admit to keep- ing on him. Part of that Hall dossier consists of a one-page memo dated August 14, 1973, \"Subject: Larry W. Bryant / Richard H. Hall.\" It concerns how the Agency was reacting to my FOIA request for documentation on their \"confidential\" contact with NICAP. Its final sentence reads: \"[Deleted] is not going to pursue the matter, however, [deleted] in their telephone conversation, suggested that we had not heard the last from Mr. Bryant.\" Do those C.I.A.-deleted references to persons or agencies pertain to my employer at the time? To get the answer, I have just filed, on May 17, 1990, an FOIA / Privacy Act lawsuit in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, titled Bryant v. Central Intelligence Agency (Civil Action No. 90-1163). In the meantime, ponder this ques- tion: Have we heard the last from the C.I.A. as to how, when, where and why it monitors the activities and ob- jectives of UFO researchers as it con- tinues to expand its store of hard-core UFO data? — Larry W. Bryant (Bryant directs, from his home in Alexandria, Va., the Washington, DC , office of the public-interest group Citizens Against UFO Secrecy.) Sikorsky \"Saucer\" STRATFORD, Conn., June 5 (AP) — The Sikorsky Aircraft division of the United Technologies Corporation said it was developing a bicycle-sized, pilotless air vehicle for the Defense Department. The six-foot-wide disk- shaped vehicle, called the Cypher, would be used for ground and naval surveillance and for relaying com- munications, Sikorsky said. It said the craft, which was designed to take off vertically in a small area and to hover relatively motionless, even in windy conditions, was being tested at wind tunnels in the United Technologies Research Center in East Hartford, Conn. Possible nonmilitary uses include anti-drug enforcement, forestry, work needed by utility com- panies and search-and-rescue mis- sions, Sikorsky said. - NY Times Key/ice's Papers Lots of rumors have been flying about recently concerning the unpublished manuscripts, papers and files left by the late Major Donald E. Keyhoe. Since they seem to \"improve\" with each retelling, to the point of absolute bizarreness in some cases, I would like to set the record straight. I am in touch with Mrs. Keyhoe and visit her periodically. She turned over to me all the UFO-related files she could find. They consist of fragments of two or three (I'm not sure which yet) chapters of an unfinished book, some scattered letters (perhaps a dozen or two), and a lot of hand-written and typed notes, and that is all. Obvious- ly a lot of his UFO material is missing and apparently lost. If more is found, Mrs. Keyhoe will notify me. Discussions have been held with the Fund for UFO Research and Mrs. Keyhoe about the possibility of publishing a limited edition of the un- finished chapters, and we hope to do MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 266 June 1990"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"13 this later in the year. However, a lot of work is involved. The manuscript fragments were scattered around in many different files and folders, and loose individual pages were found separately. At first glance, seeing so many dif- ferent chapter titles, I thought the manuscript might be fairly complete. Closer inspection revealed that the same two or three chapters, or par- tial chapters, had been rewritten several times and retitled. I have not had time to completely sort through the manuscripts and decide which loose pages go with which chapter and which draft. We have also discussed the pos- sibility of auctioning off the original manuscript (s), or copies of them, as a means of raising money for the Fund for UFO Research. Anyone on the Fund's mailing list will be duly notified of any publication or auction plans. One other point: Mrs. Keyhoe let me search through stacks of folders in Major Keyhoe's desk looking for UFO material. No case files and only a handful of original reports (familiar to me from NICAP files) were found. What became of his report files and correspondence files we don't know. They may have been lost when his of- fice in Luray, Virginia, was closed, or they may be stored in boxes some- where and eventually be found. We certainly hope that they turn up. Mrs. Keyhoe has been very cooperative in trying to locate the missing material. - Richard Hall In Others' Words ... Lucius Parish NATIONAL ENQUIRER for May 15 has more of Brad Steiger's specula- tions on \"Star People\" and the char- acteristics which supposedly set them apart from ordinary mortals. In the last column (April 1990 issue), I mentioned a book by one Ed McCabe, AGAINST GRAVITY, forth- coming from Warner Books in June. Well, yes, there is an Ed McCabe who has done considerable research into UFO events, as well as \"free energy\" devices, so it was only natural that I thought of him when I saw this book mentioned. As it turns out, the book has nothing at all to do with UFOs or related subjects (despite its title). Sorry about that! If you have heard about the British \"circles\" (and who hasn't?) and you'd like to get copies of the two major books on the subject, I would recom- mend William R. Corliss' \"The Sourcebook Project\" as your best source. He has copies of CIRCULAR EVIDENCE by Pat Delgado and Col- in Andrews (190 pages; beautiful photos) at $27.95 and Dr. Terence Meaden's THE CIRCLES EFFECT AND ITS MYSTERIES at $19.95. These prices are postpaid, making them the cheapest U.S. sources for these books. Corliss has numerous other books on UFOs and other types of unexplained phenomena, so be sure to ask for his book list and a sam- ple copy of his bi-monthly newsletter, SCIENCE FRONTIERS. The address is: The Sourcebook Project - Box 107 - Glen Arm, MD 21057. The \"UFO Update/Anti-Matter\" column in May OMNI deals with Jac- ques Vallee's research and his latest book, CONFRONTATIONS. Vallee favors the interdimensional theory to explain UFO events, prompting criticisms from both UFO proponents and skeptics. Wouldn't you like to hear those original hypnotic regression tapes in the Betty and Barney Hill case? Well, some excerpts from said tapes are now included in a two-tape \"audio book\" version of John G. Fuller's THE INTERRUPTED JOURNEY, read by none other than Whitley Strieber. Released by Caedmon, the tapes should be available at most of the \"chain\" bookstores ($15.95). An ex- tremely interesting version of a classic UFO case. Both video and audio tapes of the recent Ozark UFO Conference #2 should be available by the time you read this. Inquiries may be sent to my address (Route 1, Box 220 Plumer- ville, AR 72127). I think you'll find quite a bit of interesting material in the talks which were presented at the Conference. You may mark April 12-14, 1991 on your calendars as the time when we do it again! Dan C. Overlade Award Announced The Center for Treatment and Research of Experienced Anomalous Trauma (TREAT) takes pleasure in announcing the establishment of the Dan C. Overlade Memorial Award as a means of offering fitting tribute to an outstanding clinician and researcher in Experienced Anomalous Trauma. Dr. Overlade's contributions to the field were prematurely cut short by his tragic and untimely death in November of 1989. In Dr. Overlade's honor, an award of $500 will be made annually to the author of the research or clinical paper which does the most to advance our understanding of a significant aspect of Experienced Anomalous Trauma each year. Submissions may be of any length and must be previously unpublished. They are expected to conform to established scientific formats and may come from authors in any discipline. Papers so recognized will be presented at next TREAT Con- ference and published by the Center for Treatment and Research of Ex- perienced Anomalous Trauma. Papers may be submitted to Rima E. Laibow, M.D., 13 Summit Ter- race, Dobbs' Ferry, NY 10522. (MUFON will provide the cash award for the 1990 research paper.)

McCampbell, MUFON Director for Research Here is a provocative work that dares to respond to the ultimate ques- tion for any follower of UFO and ex- traterrestrial phenomena: Why are they here? Based on amazing new discoveries, The Watchers presents an answer that will shock and startle you. The case of Betty Andreasson Luca is a landmark in UFO abduction in- vestigations, remarkable for the vividness and drama of Luca's recall under hypnosis, for the strangely logical inner consistency of the ex- periences she relates, and for the questions that remain even after in- tense scrutiny of her fascinating ac- counts. Though the case has been studied for years, it is only recently that a breathtaking array of previously unknown extraterrestrial encounters has come to light, the implications of which cannot be dismissed. Most significant of all, these en- counters reveal the secret purpose behind the abductions of Betty An- dreasson Luca and many others throughout history — and the ultimate design behind the aliens' presence on earth and in our lives. Only after Luca discovered their disturbing prime motive did she finally give a name to the beings who have been a part of her life since childhood. She calls them the Watchers. Using a wealth of fully documented new material. The Watchers paints a vivid picture of the total abduction phenomenon as experienced by Betty and by many others — including author Raymond E. Fowler himself. The many points of commonality among disparate abduction incidents — such as physical descriptions of alien beings, examinations, ex- periments, and out-of-body ex- periences — suggest not only that we are indeed being visited, but also that the visits have actually taken place for many years. This explosive book brings us closer to the Watchers than ever before: we see their amazing equipment, their scientific knowledge and power, and the shattering consequences of what they know about our present and our future. Not since Communion has there been a story this fascinating. The Watchers gives new meaning to heretofore enigmatic aspects of alien- abduction and UFO phenomena; tan- talizing mysteries whose solutions lie in the message the aliens are now revealing to us — a message no one on this planet can ignore. Raymond E. Fowler has 25 years of experience with UFO and extrater- restrial phenomena. He has been featured in national magazines and has appeared on numerous radio and television programs to discuss his fascinating work with UFOs and ab- ductees. He is the author of UFOs: Interplanetary Visitors, Casebook of a UFO Investigator, The Andreasson Affair, and The Andreasson Affair, Phase Two. Raymond E.

Make checks payable to Ray Fowler. Mr. John Ackerman has adopted a refreshing view of UFOs in his new book, To Catch A Flying Star. He ex- plicitly accepts the premise that they are real, physical objects \"... probably originating from some advanced civilization associated with nearby stars.\" His primary interest is disclosed in the subtitle, \"A Scientific Theory of UFOs.\" Deciphering the propulsion system of these objects has challenged numerous investigators for decades. An interesting foreword by Walter H. Andrus, Jr. puts the book into an accurate perspective while a preface by Ackerman provides a brief history of the subject. Such a summary may have been extraneous here but the presentation of statistics from the Center For UFO Studies lends credibility to the subject. It is not possible in a limited space to present an overview of the book chapter-by-chapter. However, the essential thrust of the text can be described and examined in some MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 266 June 1990"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"15 detail. The author proposes that levitation and propulsion of UFOs is accomplished by extremely intense magnetic fields as they interact with that of the earth. The basic hypothesis and follow-on implications are stated with unusual clarity and are thoroughly explored. Would that many authors were as readable as Ackerman. As to the details, some technically trained readers may raise objections. Also, experts on UFOs may notice the omission of important references to previous work that may not have been known by the author. It is suggested that direct measurement of magnetic fields near UFOs be attempted as though the idea were original. No mention was made of the extensive research by Ray Stanford, Harley Rutledge and others, or the recogniz- ed need for quick-response teams with suitable equipment. A reasonable attempt by the author to calculate the strength of the magnetic source on UFOs proved that it must be enormous, being orders of magnitude (say 1,000,000 times) greater than the strongest field that has been produced in a laboratory even for brief periods. Corresponding electrical currents to produce such fields were also calculated to well beyond the range of human ex- perience as would be expected for a more advanced civilization. The magnitude of the required magnetic moment as calculated in the book is comparable with the figure inferred by Claude Poher from measurements at several government Research Stations in France. It appears that the proposed levita- tion would be the result of two magnetic fields that are mutually repelling. While attracting magnets are highly stable, opposing magnets are notoriously unstable. Opposing magnets tend to flip over suddenly in- to the attracting mode that could cause a crash. So this method of flight would require a super-sensitive and fail-proof control system. Very few useful items are designed to operate at a point of instability. Steering an automobile, for example, would be disconcerting if it were designed to deviate suddenly from a straight path. Further discussion in the book seems to require the earth's magnetic field to be exactly vertical, a condition that exists only in small regions at the terrestrial poles. Over most of the earth, its magnetic lines of force are roughly parallel to the surface, and near the magnetic equator they ac- tually are. Yet UFOs happily Hit through the skies of Brazil hardly aware of the problem. Countering the earth's field there would require a horizontal force leaving nothing to support the craft. A fundamental requirement of an acceptable theory is that it encompass all the known data. But the present theory seems incapable of explaining the electromagnetic waves emanating from UFOs that have been extensively documented. If the magnetic hy- pothesis were the final answer, it is surprising that it has been overlooked by electrical engineers and physicists for 40 years. The extreme complexity of gravita- tion can easily be appreciated from the papers of Fred Alzofon (MUFON Symposium, 1982) and Harold Puthoff (Phys Rev A, March 1. 1989J It should be noted that modifying gravity to achieve levitation is different from overcoming it by brute force in any form, whether magnetic, jet or rocketry. The mere ability to levitate or accelerate upward is not adequate to explain a key feature of UFOs. Most witnesses are certain that the ob- ject they saw was extraordinary because it behaved as though it had no mass or inertia. The consensus of modern science is that gravitational mass and inertial mass are the same thing, and therefore, inseparable. A super-science to power UFOs would surely take that into account, whereas the proposed theory does not. In other words, an object levitated by magnetic forces would still be limited by its inertia. While readers with technical train- ing may find soft spots in the theory, the book is nevertheless meritorious. Ackerman should be commended for setting forth his concepts in clear text for everyone to study. If many others went to such effort, a variety of ideas would become available for com- parison and analysis. Perhaps a single contribution would contain the long- sought answers or they may be found in the composite. The present reviewer found the book to be interesting and learned something from the line of develop- ment presented in it. It might convince a general reader that the propulsion problem has been solved, whereas it has only been worked on. Everyone who wishes to keep up with the literature on UFOs should ex- amine a copy.

They said the craft, emitting a \"thunder-like roar,\" buzzed the field at an altitude of 2000 to 5000 feet. The controllers said they followed the disc with binoculars. They estimated its speed at \"between 1000 and 1500 miles per hour.\" Cor- poral Roger Pryor first sported the vehicle as it sped across the sky. At first, he said, he thought it was a fall- ing star but he changed his mind when the craft held its altitude, turned, and made another pass over the air base. S/Sgt. Ellis Lorimer and Sgt. Virgil Cappuro also saw the disc in the early-morning sky. They said the vehicle trailed blue flame behind it \"like an acetylene torch.\" • 1955 At 11 p.m. on the 16th, a Flying Tiger Airlines' plane was on a routine flight 40 miles northeast of Springfield, Missouri. Suddenly a blue-white disc, moving at tremen- dous speed, moved toward the air- craft. After circling around the plane in a tight circle, the craft tilted up steeply and streaked out of sight. • During the night of the 23rd, the pilots of a Mohawk Airlines plane saw a strange craft with lighted open- ings race overhead. The vehicle, on- ly 500 feet above them, was elliptical in shape, and about 150 feet long. After it sped out of sight it was ob- served briefly by two Colonial Airline pilots and another aircraft crew. The craft also was seen by control tower operators at Albany, New York Air- port, as it was speeding along Victor Two Airway. It was tracked, minutes later, still on Victor Two Airway, by radar at Boston, Massachusetts. From the recorded times after the Mohawk sighting, the speed was computed as between 4000 and 4800 miles per hour. • 1965 While completing his 20th orbit on the Gemini Four Mission on the fourth, Astronaut James McDivitt caught sight of a strange looking ob- ject out in space. He made the follow- ing report: \"At the time that I saw it I said there was something out in front of me, outside the spacecraft, that I couldn't identify and I never have been able to identify, and I don't think anybody ever will. We were in drifting flight and my partner Ed White was asleep. The spacecraft had all the flight control systems turned off and almost all of the electrical equipment turned off except the radio. The spacecraft was drifting around and I couldn't tell — and I still don't know which direction it was pointing, it wasn't pointing toward Earth — but I couldn't see anything out in front of me except a black sky. \"As it was rotating around I noticed something out front that was a white cylinderical-shape with a white pole sticking out of one corner of it. It had about the same dimensional relation- ship as a beer can with a smooth pen- cil out one corner of it. I couldn't tell how close it was and I couldn't tell what the size was — depth percep- tion in space is not very good unless you know the size of the object that you're looking at. I thought I might run into it so I turned on the flight control system; it takes a while for the electronics to warm up. In the mean- time I grabbed two cameras which were floating in the space capsule. I grabbed one and took a picture. Then I let go of it and grabbed the other one and took a picture. \"As the sun set on the window I could no longer see out and the thing just disappeared. I never did find out what it was and nobody else did either. They checked NORAD records to see what they had up on radar and there wasn't anything within very close range of us. After we landed in the Atlantic Ocean the films were flown back to Houston, Texas. I've seen the photos that were released, I've seen them published in mag- azines and newspapers. Now, I went back and went through each frame of all the pictures that we took and there wasn't anything in there like what I had seen.\" General McDivitt has made it ab- solutely clear that NASA never did show him any pictures of the object which he photographed. One possi- ble explanation for this came from Dr. Garry C. Henderson, an American space expert. In a public lecture Hen- derson announced that American astronauts flying in space have not only sighted UFOs but have taken photographs and that their pictures had been locked up. Henderson said he had spoken to one astronaut who told him he was instructed along with other astronauts by NASA officials \"not to mention any UFO sightings made.\" He attributed the shroud of secrecy to NASA fears of ridicule. The U.S. Congress, he claimed, could become wary of the space program and eventually cut down on financial appropriations. When Henderson made his startling announcement he held the position of senior space research scientist with the Fort Worth, Texas division of General Dynamics. (Editor's note: Dr. Henderson is a former MUFON Consultant.) • 1970 The following report was received from a pilot holding a high management position with the Federal Government: \"In June I was stationed in San Juan, Puerto Rico, and was flying with the Puerto Rico National Guard. In the early morning, a report had been received from two air carriers, Pan American, and a local carrier, Caribair, that at dawn a large balloon-like object was sighted drifting slowly southwestward at an approx- imate altitude of 5000 to 7000 feet. MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 266 June 1990"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"17 The object was detected on radar and subsequently tracked. Movement appeared to be at four to eight knots per hour. I was a member of a flight of F-104s and a T-33 aircraft that went to the site where the object had been sighted to observe and to photograph it if possible. \"The object was visible from the ground at Isla Verde Airport, San Juan, Puerto Rico. Its appearance was similiar to a balloon. After be- coming airbom and flying towards the object, it became immediately ap- parent that it was at a very high altitude and was quite a distance away. The object was approximately 40 miles southwest of Ponce, Puerto Rico, at an altitude in excess of 60,000 feet. Myself in a T-33 and four other pilots in F-104s observed and photographed the object. The follow- ing details are noted: 1) It was a manufactured item. 2) It was at least 125 feet in width with the same ap- proximate length. 3) It was shaped similar to the forward one-third of a speedboat hull with a flat rear section and a pointed nose section. 4) There was an area of high reflectivity on the 'keel 1 approximately one-third from the nose of the object. 5) The object ... drifted slowly against the prevail- ing winds to the southwest about eight knots per hour. 6) There were no signs of any type of propulsion unit on the object. \"Extensive gun-camera film was collected showing the object very clearly. A B-52 from Ramey Air Force Base acquired the target on the ra- dar. Upon Mocking on,' the B-52 received electronic jamming. The object was kept in surveillance throughout the remainder of the daylight hours and was lost after dark. The prevailing weather at the time of the incident was clear skies and unlimited visibility. The object was viewed by the majority of the popula- tion of the island of Puerto Rico; visi- ble in plain sight for most of the day, and reported to all military intelligence activities, National Weather Service, etc. The San Juan Star published a series of articles concerning the inci- dent.\" • On the ninth, internationally fa- mous physicist Dr. James E. McDonald held an unpublicized UFO briefing before a small group of In- stitute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) gathered at Santa Monica's Miramar Hotel in California. Taped a few months before his un- timely death and two days after he had returned from two weeks of dig- ging into the UFO files at Maxwell Air Force Base, Montgomery, Alabama, McDonald told the scientists: \"As one who's spent four years on the UFO problem and who has interviewed 500 or 600 witnesses, I don't see yet any alternative that makes much sense, alternative to the extra- terrestrial hypothesis. \"I looked at about 400 cases while I was at Maxwell Air Force Base, and the number of really significant cases that to my knowledge nobody who has ever followed the UFO problem has ever heard of before, above all, the radar cases, cases of objects ex- hibiting performance characteristics that are not in anybody's aeronautical engineering book, are very, very im- pressive. We're dealing in the UFO phenomenon with phenomenology that suggests a technology. Now that I wouldn't want to back off on at all. It suggests technology — manufac- tured products. Give me five hours and I will fill five hours with personally-checked cases of close- range sightings of structured objects. \"What 1 report to you most recent- ly from Maxwell Air Force Base, where the files are alive and well, is that down there in those files are more darn radar cases, Navy, Marine Corps, Army and Air Force, than any of us have ever suspected. The number of visual sightings, say from Iowa or California or Maine, where the observers saw objects that, say, left their field of sight in a time on the order of a few seconds is a very large number. And I always wondered, when looking over those cases, why there weren't radar examples of the same sort of thing. There are! They're down in the files, explained as birds, balloons, malfunctions, false signals, propagation, absurb explanations, but one after the other, just under the rug and forgotten. They can't be that stupid. It is almost impossible to believe all those errors, the ineptness of the explanations.\" McDonald told the scientists that he discovered at Maxwell Air Force Base \"a whole broad category of 'hidden UFO reports,' reports that have never got out into any open channels and which in fact are of very significant scientific interest. The total population of hidden UFO reports is a pool of in- formation completely untapped be- cause everybody knows that UFOs are a lot of nonsense. Everybody knows they don't exist. Hence time goes by, and we laugh the problem out of existence.\" • 1975 Two Carson, California wit- nesses reported a huge dull-finished, double-domed disc hovering about 135 feet above their backyard on the sixth. The craft was first seen about 9:03 p.m. by Steve Sisneros, who was carrying trash from the house to the backyard. As he entered his yard he noticed everything seemed darker than usual, as though in a shadow. He looked up. Hovering above him was a disc-shaped object estimated to be 100 feet in diameter. The vehicle seemed to be made of silver colored steel. Steve counted eight glowing openings in the lower section of a double dome on top of the craft. The boy ran into the house yelling for his mother. The two quickly returned to the yard. Steve had the impression the bot- tom of the disc was \"rugged,\" as though \"covered with mud,\" leading to speculation the vehicle may have landed, perhaps nearby, a short time before the sighting. His mother said the bottom was \"black and looked like it was corroded ... like tar was stuck on it.\" After hovering and wobbling over the Sisneros backyard, a neigh- bor's backyard, and a trailer court for about three minutes, the disc began moving away. A smooth humming sound the craft had been emitting now grew louder.

A male UFO abduction victim living in Houston is puzzled and worried about the possibility that a device of some type was im- planted somewhere in the side of his head by his abductors. He claims he can feel the effects of the implant at certain times. Sounds seem to be transmitted into his head via the implant. Another male abduction vic- tim, barely 12 years old, claimed that small creatures took him from his bed, stuck a needle into his upper arm and then opened a square patch of skin on the left side of his head. His parents are worried that he may have re- ceived an implant of some type. Many other abductees claim they have been given implants up the nose, in die back of the neck, in the facial area, into the spinal area and at other locations for some unknown (to them) purpose. Many reported they were abducted another time so that the implant could be re- moved. Doctors have reported rem- oving subcutaneous artifacts from patients for many years. Their job was to get rid of a foreign body blamed for causing discomfort or pain to the patient. It is just possible that some of these artifacts may have been of the variety claimed by abductees to be their implants. Adding to the mystery is the fact that very few doctors are prepared to deal with the abduction problem, implants or not. Protocol Many researchers have avoid- ed the implant issue for years for a variety of reasons. But because The scale bar is 10 /xm the number of abduction cases continues to grow, it is time to establish a protocol, collect hard data, speculate on their purpose, model the conditions) and bring implants into the laboratory. Some steps in this direction have already been made, but not on a broad enough scale. For example, a very interesting analysis of an implant was re- cently presented at the TREAT II conference in Virginia. No bi- zarre claims were made, but very detailed laboratory reports were presented. As starts go, this was a good one. Imaginary? Many people feel that the whole implant problem is an imaginary one. Because it is diffi- cult to imagine how such im- plants would work or why they are there in the first place, it is much easier simply to ignore them. Unfortunately, we may well look back one day and find this ostrich-like approach similar to the response that first greeted stories of stones falling from the sky. Our own medical doctors be- gan using implants several years ago in successful attempts to ex- tend human life. Cardiac pace- makers are one of the more dra- matic examples. Numerous plas- tic and metal units have subse- quently been miniaturized to fit neatly into the human body. Examples, in fact, abound. Consider the number of slow release medicines that can now be inserted just under the skin. The latest application of such advanced techniques involves the implanting of minute amounts of brain tissue from an aborted fetus into the brain of a man suffering from Parkinson's dis- Continued on page 23 MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 266 June 1990"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"19 LETTERS ... Crops Circles ... MIBs Dear Editor: I see that Jim Deardorff reports me (in the March Journal) as \"taken in by Meaden's pseudo-scientific presen- tation\" of the plasma-vortex as an ex- planation for the crop circles. Well, not quite. If Jim cares to re-read my October article, he will see that I'm convinced we need some other fac- tor as well, and that I also reported the odd way in which the phenom- enon neatly contradicts any rash generalization made about it and has curious associations with psychic goings-on. By the time this gets into print Meaden will have held a major con- ference at Oxford about his plasma- vortex theory. For a \"pseudo- scientist\" he isn't doing too badly: Professor John Snow of Purdue University, Professor Hiroshi Kikuchi of Nihon University, Japan, and Pro- fessor Ohtsuki of Waseda, Japan, all of them keenly interested in the weirder things the atmosphere can do, are presenting papers. We must wait and see whether they, too, have been \"taken in.\" I'll give MUFON a run- down on the conference later this year. Meaden may turn out to be wrong, of course. But his is one of the few serious attempts yet made to find what forces may be at work in mak- ing the circles, and that's surely where we have to start from. What's more, it's a testable view, viz. good science whether right or wrong. My own hunch is that Meaden can't be more than partly right (anyway from what he's told us so far). The clustering of the events remains very strangely linked to certain sites and areas which are, in themselves, arch- aeological mysteries; and the impres- sion that we are dealing with a rapid- ly developing phenomenon which shows something very like \"purpose\" is now irresistable. At the time of this letter (third week in May) we've already had more than fifty events, almost all in haunted Wessex, and at least three of them show startling new patterns not seen before. A group of us have now set up a new research body, the CENTRE FOR CROP CIRCLE STUDIES (CCCS for short), headed by Pro- fessor Archie E. Roy of the Depart- ment of Physics and Astronomy at Glasgow University. We've done so precisely because we believe there may be a good deal more to the circles than atmospheric physics alone can account for. But this is com- plementary to Meaden's work, not competitive with it. We hope to open up the subject to a wider range of disciplined speculation from fields as diverse as archaeology, folklore, an- thropology and psychical research. We also aim to be international. Good reports of what are pretty clear- ly crop circles are reaching us from a number of countries around the world. Although we can still proudly claim British Wessex as the premier tourist attraction for those who want to see a circle, we've now clearly got into the export business!

Over the last 40 years there have been plenty of UFO cases with evidence stronger than that needed for a criminal conviction. That is why I take the subject seriously despite never having seen one myself. It seems to me that the \"Yates Af- fair\" reported by Peter Rojcewicz in the March 1990 issue of the Journal offered the rare opportunity to get some hard evidence on a MIB (Men In Black) case. But as it stands, we have to take it all in trust, and why should we? Who were these four policemen reportedly involved? Why no signed affidavits from any of them? Why no serious check on the identi- ty of the presumed MIB himself? If somebody could produce some MIB cases which were more than hearsay, then the subject might move out of folklore into an area of more interest to those who are convinced that some UFOs are a very definite fact that can't be explained. — Michael Buhler London LOOKING BACK, Continued ing up speed, streaked away, climb- ing rapidly to the northeast, and then straight up into the night sky. Steve said the disc flew over a small aircraft, and while it was under the craft the plane dropped for an instant as though it had momentarily lost power or was caught in \"an air pocket.\" The morning after the sighting, Mrs. Sisneros discovered that two electric clocks in her bedroom, over which she said the vehicle at one point hovered, were each five minutes slow. She said the clocks always kept correct time. Rima E.

Timely Status of Journal The MUFON UFO Journal has been late in being mailed since the January 1990 issue. The problem may be attributed to both the Editor and Associate Editor being out of town visiting their immediate families during the Christmas holidays. Con- sidering the logistics of composing, typesetting, printing and mailing 2600 copies per month, we have found it difficult to recoup the time that has been lost this year. The problem became even more serious when the April issue was not placed in the mail until May 7th. The May issue was mailed during the last week of the month. The June issue will be ready for the printers before Dennis Stacy flies to England and Hungary in June on UFO related business. The MUFON 1990 International UFO Symposium in Pensacola and travel plans will steal valuable days in July from both our schedules. Obviously, my wife and I feel that our attendance at the symposium is a priority item in our annual UFO schedule. The late April issue prompted numerous telephone calls, letters and postcards inquiring about disposition of our monthly magazine when it did not arrive promptly. Some new members feared that the Postal Ser- vice had misplaced or lost their copy and were seeking replacement copies, Other members failed to advise us of their new mailing addresses when they moved, resulting in a notification by the post office department and the automatic destruction of their Jour- nal. MUFON cannot be responsible for replacement copies when this occurs. Due to inherent problems that oc- cur from time to time, the Mutual UFO Network cannot and will not guarantee the date that your monthly magazine will be mailed or received. However, we do guarantee that each member/subscriber will be mailed twelve issues for their annual subscrip- tion. Considering that the MUFON UFO JOURNAL is the only monthly UFO magazine in the world, every subscriber is treated to a\" exceptional value compared to bimonthly or quarterly publications selling for the same annual price. Twenty-first Anniversary May 31, 1990 marked the twenty- first anniversary of the founding of the Mutual UFO Network for which we are extremely proud. We are indebted to the dedicated people who have been responsible for building MUFON into not only the leading, but the world's largest UFO organization. Starting in September 1967 as SKYLOOK, the June 1990 MUFON UFO JOURNAL commemorates the 266th consecutive monthly issue, sur- passing any past or present UFO publication. Yes, we have reason to be proud of all of you who made this feat possible. We look forward to many more years of rewarding association and healthy growth. Thank you.

He was soon able to walk better and no longer uses a cane when at home. His speech also improved. Similar experiments conducted on laboratory rats have revealed that fetal cells transplanted di- rectly into the brain can continue to grow and produce dopamine, an important brain chemical necessary for normal, controlled muscle movements. Nature Report Most intriguing is a report from Nature, Vol 323, dated September 25, 1986 Drs. John Wolstenholme, Ian Harlow, George Clarke, Hilary Sheridan, Jon Jonasson, Mark Crocker and Helen Matthews of the De- partment of Genetics, Churchill Hospital, Headington, England, reported finding a mystery object amid the chromosomes. Their report is as follows: \"The very tiny object shown below (See page 18), much like a frag- mented crossword in appearance, was recently found in one of our routine chromosome preparations for prenatal diagnosis following amniocentesis. \"But what is it? Is it a man- made device? Packing text as binary coded information on the miniature scale would seem advantageous. Or is it a naturally occurring substance? \"None of the possibilities we have been able to think of would seem to be appropriate for amni- otic fluid, so if anybody is able to suggest an answer to this mys- tery we would like to have it. We are as intrigued as we are igno- rant.\" It is hardly the intent of this brief monologue to argue wheth- er or not abductions are real, or whether or not implants exist. Instead, it is hoped that more researchers will take the implant issue seriously, keep their egos \"If anybody is able to suggest an answer to this mystery we would like to have it. We are as intrigued as we are ignorant.\" intact, and look at the possibili- ties. Behavior Modifiers? Any other approach is to per- mit wild speculation and distrust to rule, and this is absolutely of no service to anyone. Many peo- ple now believe that the implants are there as a way of monitoring or controlling their behavior. A few are believed to be tiny trans- ceivers for the purpose of com- municating in one way or anoth- er. And a few people even be- lieve that the implants were put there to help them overcome some life-threatening condition. These and other beliefs are undeniably interesting. However, it is time to move beyond the belief barrier toward some real answers. Fortunately, this is one realm of the abduction issue available for laboratory analysis. I am considering the implant issue as part of my catalog of medical and psychological effects resulting from UFO reports. I would greatly appreciate receiv- ing further information on this subject from anyone willing to share the information, which I believe to be for a good cause. I can be reached at P. O.

Donald R Schmitt Symposium Speaker and Wisconsin State Director On June 2, 1990 all 600 seats in the ballroom at the Pensacola Hilton Hotel have been reserved (sold-out). Arrangements have been made to handle the overflow attendees by providing two rooms in the Hilton to seat 100 people where they will view the speakers on closed-circuit TV. A room for 196 people has been scheduled at the nearby Park Inn Hotel where the speakers may be viewed on a large screen TV with a one hour delay. A reduced total price ($25.00) will prevail for both of the above presentations. The exhibits, displays, registration desk and sales tables in Grand Cen- tral Station at the Hilton will be open to everyone. Every effort is being ex- tended to accommodate the an- ticipated crowd. Anyone holding an advanced registration for the sym- posium, that will be unable to at- tend, should obtain a refund im- mediately from Art Hufford so their seats may be used for people on the waiting list. Also, please cancel your hotel reservations so the rooms may be sold to others desiring to attend.

Andfus, Jr. MUFON 1990 Symposium The theme for the MUFON 1990 International UFO Symposium in Pensacola, Florida is \"UFO's: The Im- pact of E.T. Contact Upon Society.\" It will convene on the weekend of Ju- ly 6, 7 and 8 at the beautiful Pen- sacola Hilton Hotel, only a few miles from the Gulf Breeze Sightings that are continuing after over two years. Sponsored by the Mutual UFO Net- work, the symposium will be hosted by Pensacola MUFON with Vicki P. Lyons, General Chairperson; Charles D. Flannigan, State Director; Carol and Rex Salisberry, Co-State Section Directors; and Donald M. Ware, Eastern Regional Director. The speaking program agenda is listed separately in this issue of the Journal. A \"Get Acquainted\" Recep- tion with hors d'oeuvres will be held Friday evening, July 6, from 6 to 9 p.m. Cost: $5 per person before June 1; advance reservations are required. A cash bar will be available. The ad- vance registration fee for all five speaking sessions is $35.00 before June 1 and $40 thereafter. A chartered bus tour of UFO sites in the Gulf Breeze area is scheduled for Sunday morning, July 8 from 7:00 a.m. to 9:45 a.m. Advance reserva- tions for the bus tour are required; bus fee: $12 per person before June 1. (Four buses have already been sold- out and more are available.) The Pensacola Hilton is located at 200 East Gregory St., Pensacola, FL 32501 (downtown). Due to the large attendance at the symposium, all rooms at the Pensacola Hilton have been sold-out. The Park Inn Hotel at 223 East Garden St., telephone number (904) 433-8331. is also sold- out, as is the Day's Inn Motel on Palafox and Cervantes streets. Reser- vations are now being taken by the Hampton Inn in Pensacola. Mrs. Lyons has arranged with the Pensacola Hilton, (904) 433-3336, to provide the telephone numbers of the hotels or motels currently accepting reserva- tions, so as to minimize long distance calls. Interest in attending the 1990 UFO Symposium has exceeded all expectations. The ballroom at the Pensacola Hilton will seat 600 people. See \"News Rash\" in this issue for over- flow accommodations (page 23). Delta Airlines is the official airline for the 1990 Symposium. Delta is of- fering 40% off regular coach fares and 5% off their lowest available fare. Seniors (age 62 or older) get an ad- ditional 10% off the lowest available fare. To get these discounts, you must call: 1-800-768-5463; ask for Reagan or Sue at Gulf Breeze Travel and tell them that you are coming to the MUFON Symposium. Since only a limited number of seats at these prices are allocated on each flight, the airline tickets have been selling fast Due to popular demand, Mrs. Lyons has arranged with Avis Car Rentals special rates for those want- ing to rent a car to tour Gulf Breeze at night or transportation from motels to the Pensacola Hilton. Low daily and weekly special convention rates are available with unlimited mileage. To reserve a car at the discount rate call: 1-800-331-1600 and give the reservationist this AWD number: A/B794606.

National UFO Information Week The Sixth National UFO Informa- tion Week has been scheduled for August 12-19, 1990. This will be an ideal opportunity for State and State Section groups to set up photo ex- hibits, displays, booths for receiving UFO sighting reports from the public and closed circuit TV showing of UFO documentaries, etc. in shopping malls and libraries. Advance planning is re- quired in order to reserve space in these facilities and to construct the ex- hibits and displays. Marge Christen- sen, Director of Public Education, heartily endorses this program in order to take advantage of the re- surging interest in UFOs by the public, printed media and television.
