It looked, he said, as if a large rock had been dropped an4 had bee-: broken and the pieces scaktered by the impacc. The location of Mr. RodgersT find is in the Santa-Fe - Molino 2re3 which was strongly suspected of being the s5te ?f a meteorite fall in December of 1967. Experts from the Snithsohizx Tcstituti(.n ~s well as private-hobbyists came here that month and talked with residents who had seen the meteor fire in the sky, looking at marly rock samples and tramping through the woods looking for the meteorite, They filially gav.- UP 9 saying that if it was ever found, it would be by chznce by some farmer or woodsman. Rodgersl sampie is the most likely prospect brought to the Leg-gzr (Mexico, Mo. ) in the last three years. Its weight is the most signli'i- cant thing--a pyramid shaped ~iece about 4$ by 3$ by 2 inches weighed one pound, 10 ounces, about double the weight of a similar piece of limestone. The surface'is smoothed off, as if by heat, but pocked ard pitted. The broken parts show a liver-red, closely packed substance resembling jasper. It leaves a mark the color of burnt umber on ungiazc; pottery surfaces. The material resembles rich iron ore, but it doesv't react at all to a magnet. There appears to be a small amoun% of sijica or mica in part of the rocks. Credit: Rod Dyke's Clipping Service, 3521 S.

Some 2-3 minutes later, another less brilliant red object appcared at about the same altitude, but to the west of the original ligh;. This second object was abol~t the size end intensity of a pzrachute flare and acted much like one, fizz- ing and sputtering as it dropped slowly toward the ground. I watched for sbout an hour after this, but nothing else appeared. The first object could have been a flare, but if so, it was the largest and brightest fbre I've seen and I've seen plenty of them. The adparent lack of movement of the first object could have been due to the fact that the wind was blowing from the south and would have blown any object almost directly away from me. With lights of high intensity, a movement directly sway from the observer is almost undetectable ,for several minutes. It did not act like a flare and I can think of aks- lutely no reason why znyone would set off flares in that area. If it WJ not a flare, it was almost certhinly a UFO. However, please ddn't use this report unless and until I c:n do ro-- checking.
