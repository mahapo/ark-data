FROM THE EDITOR As this summer's Symposium approaches, events can hardly be expected to stand still. Three major UFO books in particular seem sure to garner a good deal of public attention this spring. Whit ley Strieber's controversial COMMUNION currently stands at number three on the New York Times nonfiction bestseller list. Looming on the horizon are Budd Hopkins' INTRUDERS and Gary Kinder's LIGHT YEARS. Feelings about the latter have already reached fever pitch. In the December issue of the Journal we premiered an exclusive author's preview of COMMUNION. In this issue we do the same for INTRUDERS, and next issue will be Gary Kinder's turn. We think you'll find Kinder's long article a reasoned, restrained : rejoinder ; to the many criticisms that have come his way since his name was associated with the Eduard Meier case. We think you'll also find it a fascinating glimpse into the case itself. Herein, you'll find an update of the Alaskan UFO reported by JAL-flight 1628, a lengthy look at UFO radio interference by James McCampbell, and a speculative piece about marine light wheels, plus most of our regular departments.

When Missing Time was published six years ago I resolved not to write another book on the subject of UFO abductions unless I discovered what seemed to be crucial new information about this bizarre phenomenon. For me, this condition has now been more than adequately met. I may, of course, be very wrong in my reading of the data, and I look to the work of other researchers to provide either confirmation or drastic alteration of my . conclusions. ' I feel, however, that the material presented in my new book, Intruders, supplies the answers to some of our basic questions as to the purpose behind the abduction phenomenon. As a corollary this new information also provides an explanation as to why covert UFO interaction with our species has gone on for so many years and has apparently involved such a large number of human subjects. In 1978 I began writing Missing Time because of three central discoveries. The first involved the fact that an individual could have been abducted with almost no -conscious recollection of the experience - nothing more, say, than a powerful, irrational fear of a certain place, a stretch of highway, a particular area in a woods, and so on. No remembered UFO sighting, as in the nearly canonical Betty and Barney Hill case. No consciously recalled period of missing time. No memories of lights or sounds or humanoids. Nothing more than a profound and unanchored fear of a specific location, or some other odd, single, dangling memory. In other words, anyone could have undergone this sort of experience and afterwards have no reason to tie the tiny remaining shards of memory to the UFO phenomenon. It is highly possible, therefore, that the vast majority of UFO abduction cases will never be uncovered — another unpleasant, paranoia-inducing idea we must wrestle with! SCARS The second discovery had to do with the fact that a number of people bear similar scars resulting from an apparent cell-sampling operation carried out when they were abducted as little children. This important evidence helps to validate the phenomenon as well as to root it in the physical, rather than the psychological or spiritual realms. But the third and most important implication of the.data in Missing Time was the idea that abductees are often taken more than once in their lifetimes, as if they are being regularly tracked, followed, checked upon at intervals. After the publication of the book I received hundreds of letters, many of which furnished extensive new support to the three concepts discussed above. I have examined scars and scar-photos. I have explored complex, classic abduction cases which came to light only because a reader for the first time connected a particular recurring childhood dream to aspects of the UFO abduction phenomenon. Above all, I have come to realize that the vast majority of UFO abductees have indeed been taken more than once. It is what one can call, for want of a better phrase, an ongoing, perhaps lifetime study of these individuals by their captors. It has not been my task here to add any flesh to the skeletal outline I've provided above. These assertions are offered only as such, but Intruders, I believe, will provide the necessary data to back up what I've been saying. The first new discovery that impelled me to undertake another book was an extension of the idea of the UFO occupants' ongoing interest in particular abductees. I began to find that this interest extended beyond individuals into actual families — bloodlines if you will. The \"Davis\" family in Indiana provided the most dramatic illustration of this phenomenon, in that members of three succeeding generations have had harrowing UFO encounters; their complex, collective story has provided my book its scaffolding. MISSING EMBRYO I've dealt with fourteen other families, however, who also seem to be the objects of ongoing UFO curiosity, and several of these cases are dealt with in Intruders. This issue of generational interest associated itself in my mind with descriptions I and many other investigators have received of sperm and ova sampling operations which have apparently taken place during UFO abductions over the years. And central to everything are the accounts I began to receive of gynecological procedures which suggested artificial insemination — and the later removal, during subsequent abductions, of the developing embryo. I cannot, in this article, begin to try to encapsulate the complex data and medical information I have received during the past few years about this subject. When we add together individual medical case histories, normal recollection and hypnotic recall we are left with a pattern of apparently widespread genetic experimentation by the occupants of UFOs. The data suggests an inescapable conclusion — that the human race itself is the subject of an ongoing breeding experiment. I know how that statement sounds when it is made flatly, directly, without (continued next page)"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"qualification. I want you, the reader, to know that it is every bit as intrinsically unbelieavable, unthinkable, to me as it must be to you. And yet that is what the data inescapably suggests. I have now worked with seven women, all abductees, who describe having been shown tiny babies — hybrids, combining human and distinctly alien features. Several of these women were led to believe that they, themselves, had provided the ova from which these infants were developed. The' descriptions of these hybrids are remarkably similar, and there is reason to believe that the women were shown their \"offspring\" for a specific reason, an issue I explore in my book. MOTIVES If this \"unthinkable\" pattern is true, several things immediately follow. Years of covert UFO interaction with our people would of course be necessary if generations of experimentation are required. to develop the proper genetic mix. A widespread search might be required to locate the most desirable genetic specimen, so many human abductions might have been necessary, with cell-. sampling beginning at a very early age. Thus there may be very cogent reasons for the UFOs' decades of activity, for the apparently large numbers of subjects they have abducted, and for the incisions they almost routinely make on the bodies of young children. UFO occupants have usually been described as being \"neutral\" or \"methodical\" or \"scientific\" in their behavior, inflicting no deliberate harm but also not providing us with any cosmic wisdom or even helpful information, technological or otherwise. But if their basic goal is, as now appears, a genetic interbreeding, then all of this behaviour is consistent and understandable. They are not here, it would seem, to colonize, to conquer, or to aid us by \"saving us from ourselves.\" They are simply taking something from us that they need, with as little interference as possible. 1978 is, as most of us know, the fortieth anniversary of Kennth Arnold's famous sighting, and the beginning of the \"flying saucer\" wave in the United States. Four decades later, despite the strident efforts of \"skeptics,\" government \"information\" officers and the more narrow-minded members of the press, the physical reality of this outrageous and unthinkable phenomenon is more certain than ever. As the evidence has accumulated ' our information has become ever more detailed and a new group of intellectually gifted researchers has entered the fray. I believe that 1987 will mark the turning point in our quest for answers to this most profound modern enigma, and to this end I offer my new book. A .final note: Last year I was presented an award honoring my work in the field of UFO research. The fact that this award was voted by the membership of MUFON in a democratically conducted poll makes it even more precious to me. I have been searching for the proper forum to express my thanks for this honor, and I think I have found it, right here at the conclusion of this paper. I only hope that my new study of the abduction phenomenon fully justifies the respect you have given me. ®1987 Budd Hopkins (Readers can order Intruders: The Incredible Visitations in the Copley Woods, by Budd Hopkins, from: Random House, Attention: Order Entry, 400 Hahn Road, Westminister, MD 21157, or by phone: 1-800-634- 6460.

JAL SIGHTING UPDATE On Sunday morning, January II; 1987 at 7:30 a.m. (Alaska Time Zone) Captain Kenjyu Terauchi, Japan Air Lines pilot, reported seeing unusual lights on two occasions over barren, interior Alaska from a Boeing 747 cargo flight enroute from London to a refueling stop in Anchorage. Flying at 37,000 feet, both the co-pilot, who was flying the aircraft, and Terauchi reported seeing lights twice, once for a period of about 20 minutes and once for about 10 minutes as their route took them over Fort Yukon and Fairbanks, Alaska. In both cases, the lights approached from the front of the 747, went underneath the aircraft and reappeared behind it, Paul Steucke, By Walt Andrus FAA spokesman said. Terauchi radioed word of the sighting to an air traffic controller in Anchorage. His statement to the controller was \"irregular lights, looks like a spaceship,\" Steucke said. Controllers and their supervisors immediately checked their radar screens to determine if there were any objects around the JAL aircraft. There were none and that was confirmed by military radar (Elmendorf AFB), Steucke said. The co-pilot reported seeing the lights, but did not watch them as long as Terauchi. The aircraft's flight engineer, who sits farther back in the cockpit indicated he was uncertain whether he saw any lights at all. These were not the same crew members with Capt. Terauchi that observed the 3 objects on November 17,1986 in the same general area. When he was asked point-blank by the FAA investigators if the lights that he saw Sunday morning were like the November 17 sighting, Capt. Terauchi said, \"No, no, there's no similarity between the two.\" (Readers should refer to the February 1987 issue of the MUFON UFO Journal for details on the November 17, 1986 encounter.) BOUNCE LIGHT Steucke said FAA officials and"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"experienced pilots speculate that Sunday's sighting could have been caused by a weather phenomenon called \"bounce light effect.\" Both times Terauchi reported seeing the lights Sunday, the airplane was flying over villages, Stuecke said. \"The ground temperature in the area was about minus-23 and there was a temperature inversion at 23,500 feet,\" he said. \"Temperature inversions in cold climates, with ice crystals, have been known to create a bounce light effect.\" (In a temperature inversion, a layer of warmer air traps a layer of colder air closer to the Earth's surface.) The Anchorage weather bureau reported a low of minus-10 degrees Sunday morning. Light from the villages could have reflected off ice crystals in the inversion and appeared to be hovering in mid-air, Steucke said. As the plane approached and passed over the villages, the reflected light would have appeared to go under the aircraft and reappeared behind it, as Terauchi described the lights he saw Sunday, Steucke said. He also added that the bounce- light theory is only speculation, not a FAA agency finding. \"Those of us involved in this talked about it,\" Steucke said. \"People who are experienced at flying mentioned that it is not an infrequent occurrence.\" Both the November 17, 1986 and January 11, 1987 sightings are still under investigation by the Federal Aviation Administration. The FAA in Anchorage has promised to release their investigation of the November 17, 1986 sighting in a report on March 5, 1987, which they did. COMPARISONS Assuming that the January 11, 1987 sighting of lights was nothing more than the speculated explanation given above, which is a logical posibility, the latter sighting provides some valuable comparisons to further substantiate the validity of the November 17,1986 UFO sighting. I will enumerate a few of these* for review: 1.) A confirmed radar image was observed by controllers at both the FAA in Anchorage and radar at Elmendorf AFB of a second target during the episode. (None on January 11, 1987.) 2.) If the second target was an \"echo\" from the 747 that occurs in the Fort Yukon to Fairbanks air corridor, originally advanced as a possible explanation, why didn't it appear on the radarscopes on January 11, 1987? 3.) In the January 7, 1987 issue of USA TODAY, Marilyn Adams reported that Paul Steucke told her that \"analysis of the electronic radar record shows both images are the 747 — one from the FAA radar signal and one from the jet's transponder.\" However, on January 11,1987 the \"jet's transponder\" was apparently not producing a second target, only its normal airline identification signature/code. 4.) The FAA said their controller had mistakenly interpreted a \"split- image\" of the cargo plane as a second object following a review of radar tapes. 5.) None of the flight crew members observed structured objects on January 11, only lights. On November 17, 1986, when the two belts or cylinders of amber lights continued to dance in front of his plane, Terauchi grabbed for his camera, but realized that taking a picture would be futile because there was not enough light to expose the film properly. RADAR PROBLEMS In the November 17,1986 incident, it appears that the FAA has been trying to explain away their original radar confirmation. However, they do not question the integrity and testimony of the flight crew after conducting their own investigation. (Philip J. Klass seems to be alone in his explanation that the flight crew saw nothing more than the planet Jupiter and maybe Mars.) The March issue of the MUFON UFO Journal will report the FAA's March 5 conclusion if it is available before going to press. On one hand the FAA is trying to explain away the second radar target in Alaska, whereas in a recent fatal collision in flight they embarrassingly admit that the private aircraft that collided with an airliner was never detected on radar — very interesting. Associated Press reported on January 16, 1987 that a twin-engine Skywest Airlines Fairchild Metroliner and a single-engine Mooney M-20 collided over Kearns, Utah while the Skywest was making its final approach to Salt Lake City International Airport, killing all ten aboard both planes. FAA officials said the collision occurred at 7000 feet. Visibility at the time was 30 miles with a cloud ceiling of .7000 feet, authorities said. The Mooney went undetected by either radar or radio at the Salt Lake City control tower, said Tom Doyle, an assistant air traffic manager at the international airport. \"I don't know where that aircraft was,\" he said. \"We were in complete control of the , Skywest aircraft. He was inbound to the airport and doing exactly what he was supposed to do, from our perspective on radar and voice communications.\" Sheri Casen, a Federal Aviation Administration spokeswoman at the Seattle regional headquarters, also said \"there were no other targets observed on the radar\" when the twin-engine Skywest aircraft dropped off the screen at 12:56 p.m. MST. Obviously, there are extenuating circumstances connected with the JAL flight 1628 sighting in Alaska on November 17, 1986, compared to the collision near Salt Lake City where ten people lost their lives. Paul Steucke, FAA spokesman said they reopened their inquiry for the following purpose: \"The reason we're exploring it is that it was a violation of air space. That may sound strange, but that's what it was.\" National security in a sensitive area near Russia is a significant issue in this investigation. How effective is our radar network in protecting the North American continent? And we can pose the question — have the operators of UFOs solved the Stealth aircraft goal of being free from radar detection?"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"MARINE LIGHT WHEELS By Robert Hendrickson, PhD. Robert Hendrickson is a MUFON consultant in entomology and Delaware state director. Anomalous lights under and on the sea are diverse phenomena summarized in.Corliss (1982), Fort (1974), and Sanderson (1970). One of the most peculiar forms is wheels of light. These are hubs around which spokes of light revolve. Corliss (1982) synthesized many reports, \"The spokes may be straight, curved, or S- shaped. Rotation is in either direction and may change during the display. In some cases, the outer part of the wheel seems to spin in a different sense from the central part. Illustrating the illusory character of the phenomenon, different observers sometimes see the same wheel rotating in opposite directions. Wheel sizes range from tens of feet to several miles, with spoke widths of 5-50 feet being common.\" As an example, Evans, hydrographer aboard the H.M.S. Vulture observed light wheels near Bahrain which were reported by Pringle (1879). \"On looking towards the east, the appearance was that of a revolving wheel with centre on that bearing, and whose spokes were illuminated, .and looking towards the west a similar wheel appeared to be revolving, but in the opposite direction.\" The spokes were about 25 ft. wide, separated by a dark interval of about 75 feet, and appeared at a rate of 74-75 per minute. Light wheels may have been described in ancient Indian literature (Sanderson) and sightings continue into the 1980's (Corliss 1986). They are most commonly reported from the periphery of the Indian Ocean. The explanations for light wheels are generally biological or mechanical. Moss (1879) suggested \"noctilucae and crustaceans . . . but if so, the exceedingly swift-travelling cause of the stimulation would still remain unaccounted for.\" An observer in Fort, 6 General configuration of a typical phosphorescent wheel \"pulsations of long strings of jellyfish.\" Harris (1880), \"electro-magnetic currents exercising their exciting influence upon some organic animal or vegetable substance.\" Corliss (1982), \"If the light source is not bidluminescence, as generally supposed, the anomaly is even stronger.\" Sanderson eliminated several hypotheses and was reduced to the \"most 'unpleasant' notion — i.e. that the source of the triggering energy is mechanical.\" Fort thought extraterrestrial \"super-constructions\" were involved and his lead will be followed in the analysis of a subset of the observations, i.e. light wheels operating in groups of two or more, moving abreast. If the source of light wheels is mechanical and they have been reported for hundreds or possibly even thousands of years, they cannot be of human origin, although perhaps we have the technology now to crudely duplicate the phenomenon on submarines. We assume here they're UFO-related. We have no problem getting UFOs into or out of oceans since there are many reports of these events. UFO TRAWLERS? But what are they doing? Why the lights? One thing undersea lights do is frighten fish. An 1826 account in Corliss (1982) reported, \"Long tortuous lines of light in a contrary direction to the sea, showed us immense numbers of very large fish darting about as if in consternation at the scene.\" So why frighten fish? Maybe revolving undersea beams of light are Three sets of expanding rings—two circular, one elliptical"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"used to herd fish, to force them into a particular place in the sea or in relation to light wheels. We limited our discussion to light wheels in groups of two or more, advancing abreast. If fish swim rapidly away from a disturbing light stimulus, they may tend to more- or-less line up midway between two of them, not knowing in which direction to escape. If a pair of light wheels towed a narrow, tubular net between them, they could rapidly sweep vast areas of the sea for fish, in a form of trawling far more efficient than that of modern day commercial trawlers with their huge, cumbersome, slowly-towed nets. Observations supporting the trawling hypothesis are fragmentary but suggestive. Pringle (1879) reported that \"the ship passed through oily- looking fish spawn\" while observing light wheels. Harris (1880) noted that the water was \"studded with patches of faint, luminous, inanimate matter.\" during his sighting. Perhaps if a substantial catch 'of fish is dragged through water fast enough, pressure will force fish body contents out, which float to the surface. Possibly the ships crossed the paths of nets. Fort compiled a number of reports relating to a fascinating 19th century incident. \"Report of the British Association, 1861-30: That, upon June 18, 1845, according to the Ma/fa Times, from the brig Victoria, about 900 miles east of Adalia, Asia Minor (36° 40' 56\", N. Lat.: 13° 44' 36\", E. Long.), three luminous bodies were, seen to issue from the sea, at about half a mile from the vessel. They were visible about ten minutes.\" (Sanderson notes that east in the quote is a typographical error for west. ) At about the same time, a witness in AdaJiaj Asia Minor noted \"a body that appeared and then broke up\" in a sighting that lasted twenty minutes to half an hour. Other .witnesses remarked' that two luminous bodies, apparently five times the size of the moon, were connected by \"sail-like or streamer-like appendages,\" which appeared as \"large flags blown out by a gentle breeze.\" A possible scenario for these sightings is that three extraterrestrial vehicles had been light wheeling, or trawling, for fish using two nets. They exited from the sea. One of. the outside Spinning groups of phosphorescent patches UFOs transferred its net end to .the other outside UFO, then went its own way. The remaining two UFOs were then transporting two nets loaded with fish to an unseen mothership when they were observed. Indeed it's a wild hypothesis. Perhaps the principal objection to it is that aliens capable of travelling several light years from a nearby star system do not require food from a planet they watch. Motherships are reportedly huge.. They can probably transport enormous quantities of food and also grow their own aboard ship. On the other hand, why should they ignore an abundant supply of highly nutritious food which can be easily removed from a planet without disturbing its natives, who don't even know it's happening. Trawling is a way to conserve a mothership's food stores. Maybe fresh fish is a welcome, change in diet. Probably the reason most sightings are reported from the Indian Ocean is that the water is relatively clear there and beams of light can penetrate great distances before attenuation, at least compared to more murky bodies of water, such as the North Atlantic. In the Indian Ocean they may be able to'catch a lot of fish fast. REFERENCES CITED 1) Corliss, W.R. 1982. Lightning,' auroras, nocturnal lights and related luminous phenomena.'

Most people do not wish to be faced . with the impossible task of sorting out UFO facts from UFO fiction. Readers of this journal are the . exception, but many of you are new to the subject and are part of a growing, reputable research field which is rapidly adding scientists of all disciplines to its ranks. But it was not always so. In its . beginnings, (the late forties through the sixties), most of the investigation was left to lay citizens who battled the forces of disbelief and philosophical contacteeism as best they could. On January 12, 1987, Mrs. Idabel Epperson departed the earthly spheres. She was one of the early pioneers of research in Los Angeles, California, who extended her knowledge and influence widely around the world. She was a diminuitive woman, behind whose sweet face and sparkly eyes dwelt an astute and incisive mind. She had youth in curiosity, years in .wisdom. Homemaking was her vocation, sprinkled with volunteer work on civic projects such as pollution control and politics. But her avocation was an all-consuming desire to see the mystery of the UFO solved once and for all. In this, of course, she was not alone in those early days, but in view of the particular talents she contributed to the work she is deserving of special mention. LONELY VIEWS She was one of the early \"lonely ones\" of UFO research, and from the early 1950s frequently received inquiring letters and telephone calls, in which other pioneers expressed their lonely views that there seemed more to UFO reports than mirages and myths. She .gathered around her a group of acquaintances — fellow researchers 8 and investigators — not only in the Los Angeles area but in many parts of the world. Through generous sharing of all UFO information which passed over her desk, round-robin letters, and frequent phone calls, she kept them from feeling lonely, linking them in a loose association. I was one of those \"lonely ones\" who sought her out in 1957. She quickly became my mentor and friend. Largely because of her efforts, Southern California became a solid source of well-documented sighting reports by a goodly number of trained investigators, many of whom she trained in research skills. Our area changed from a mecca for philosophizing, scheming \"crackpots\" to a reputable source of UFO information for the media. Largely through her pioneering efforts, the wavering public which, like Pavlov's dog, automatically \"believed in UFOs\" when the number of publicized sightings was high and \"disbelieved\" when the Air Force made its periodic official denials of UFO existence, now heard rational Southern California voices speaking out on the true facts of UFO research. Most of us were members of NICAP in those days, though not all. LANS, the Los Angeles NICAP Subcommittee, which encompassed many of our group, gained a prestigious place in national UFO research. Idabel became its Chairman after the death of gentle Dr. Leslie Kaeburn, a renowned biophysicist who was one of the first true scientists to enter the fray, and who was LANS' first Chairman. From these early \"lonely\" days, we advanced to the wave of nationwide sightings which began in 1964, especially the bizarre Michigan sightings of April 1966. We cheered when then-Representative Gerald Ford, Minority Leader of the House of Representatives, publicly called for open Congressional hearings. How refreshing it was to see a noted government figure stand up against the possibility of official criticism! Then came the Air Force contract ($300,000) to the University of Colorado to conduct \"an independent study\" of the phenomenon. Idabel at L.A.'s helm, we fed the Condon Committee the cream of our cases. Although we got along fine with a few of the more objective Committee members, Condon's minions mangled and misread, changed facts and charged \"hoax.\" Through it all, Idabel kept her composure. INSPIRATION What first inspired her to personally investigate UFOs? She recounted how, one evening in 1955, she and her daughter Marilyn (who shares her mother's intellect, interviewing skills and public relations abilities) were startled to hear a serious report over local CBS television regarding the alleged landing of a glowing UFO in the San Fernando Valley. The broadcast was by a Los Angeles newsman, well-known for his hardheaded attitude toward anything smacking of the fantastic. Idabel and Marilyn were curious and decided to contact the man on whose property the UFO had reportedly landed. They visited his home, saw the large double-trunked tree split on one side where the \"spacecraft\" had come to rest. Sitting there, looking directly into Mr. K's sincere blue eyes as he described the handsome people who had stepped from the UFO and conversed with him in perfect English, Isabel felt that the man looked honest. However, as they left, she mentioned to Marilyn that those types of double- trunked trees, like the one supposedly split by the \"spacecraft,\" often split (continued next page)"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"REMEMBERED, Continued spontaneously, probably by sheer force of their own weight. At Mr. K's home during that first interview, was an experienced saucer researcher, Jackie Sanders, who listened to Mr. K's story with close attention. Within 24 hours, Idabel and Marilyn had proved for themselves that Mr. K's story was an elaborate hoax. It was then that Jackie Sanders admitted to her that she had disbelieved him from the beginning.. \"Why didn't you tell me sooner?\" Idabel asked. \"Even though I'd just met you,\" replied Jackie, \"I knew it was your first investigation. I didn't want to disillusion you. Also, I wanted you to have the experience of finding out for yourself the kinds of people you are likely to meet in this business.\" From this experience, Idabel learned a valuable technique. As she expressed it, \"No matter how wild a witness's story, just sit and seem to be taking it all in. If they are truthful, no harm is done; in fact, you will earn the witness's confidence. If it is a hoaxer or deluded person, your believing attitude spurs them on. Like Mr. K., they soon overreach themselves and expose their stories for the lies they are.\" HOAXER Mr. K. wasn't the only hoaxer or 'delusionary interviewed by her. During the fifities, the breed of old-style contactees, common to Los Angeles paraded across the pages of the local newspapers, some decked out in their silver suits and bobbing antennae! Idabel carefully checked each one out. By the sixties, when LANS was formed, such stories were getting old. The newer \"contactees\" were hard' put to invent tales fitting into the old Space Brother theme. NICAP regarded all contactees with extreme skepticism. Idabel's attitude was closer to dismay. She realized that such unsubstantiated stories, channelings, and \"space conferences\" with which Southern California abounded caused great harm to the objective work which scientifically-oriented organizations like NICAP, APRO, and CSI were doing. Her health was far from robust, but she continued her exhausting public- relations in the communications media, helping to distinguish between the weavers of wild tales and objective ufologists like herself. From 1955 on, she became acquainted with most of the famous names in the field. Among them were serious researchers of national renown, . such as Maj. Donald E. Keyhoe, Director of NICAP during the \"good years,\" journalist Frank Edwards, author of several classic books about UFOs, Harold Fulton, the New Zealand researcher who corresponded . regularly regarding sightings on the other side of the world, and Martha and Harold Sherman, the latter, being one of the nation's modern pioneers in psychic research who met Idabel when he was witness to the famous \"Hollywood sighting,\" a vivid, multi- witness UFO incident. Investigated 'mainly by Idabel and Marilyn, the \"Hollywood Report\" remains today a model of in-depth investigation and conservative reporting. Other equally mystifying objects were researched by Idabel and LANS. The whirling \"Mexican-hat\" UFOs over Whittier, California, a green geranium- pot-shaped object over Temple City, the \"straw-hat\" UFO in Santa Ana which left four memorable imprints in the Polaroid camera of Rex Heflin — all in turn captured her attention. Ad infinitum. One of Idabel's invaluable traits was a finely : tuned interviewing manner. Her voice was low, with perfect diction, and she radiated always an image of ladylike mien. Brusque newsmen, busy weather station personnel, reluctant witnesses — all felt the charm of her soft inquiries. Another of her talents was the ability to think on her feet, and she was sought after for lectures, media appearances and panel discussions. I recall one time when I was most impressed by her cool. She had consented to be interviewed in her home by a local TV-radio station regarding the 1966 Michigan sightings. Somehow, she got the impression that the interview was to be recorded for radio only. She had gathered pertinent notes and papers, intending to refer to certain statistics and facts. On the day of the interview, she watched with horror as a lone young man lugged a heavy television camera up the walk to her front door. \"I understood this was to be for radio,\" she said, looking behind him for an interviewing reporter. There was none. \"Not radio. Televison, ma'am,\" he replied, with the charm of an iguana. \"This is a camera.\" \"I - know THAT!\", she replied. The young technician, a bored expression on his face, turned on some bright lights, stuck Idabel in a corner, turned on his camera, and demanded, \"Now, talk!\" That night, the viewers of that station heard Mrs. Epperson, in her . cool, tactful manner, deny the Air Force explanation of \"swamp gas.\" There was no sign of the papers which she had gathered to consult for her facts; she was thinking on her feet. \"The 89 university students and the Civil Defense director of Hillsdale, Michigan, sighted a UFO far from any swamp,\" she said. She referred further to the Air Force's argument, that no pilot, terrestrial or extraterrestrial' — would choose a swamp to land in. She called upon facts provided by New Zealand's .Harold Fulton,; about the mysterious \"saucer nests\" which had appeared in the swamps of Australia. She gave'- fact after • fact, as her quicksilver mind whirred within. During the late sixties and into the seventies, Idabel and Allen Hynek became cooperative colleagues. She formed fast- friendships with Walt and Jeanne Andrus after LANS disbanded and its members joined MUFON. The late, lamented Dr. James E. McDonald visited her often, sharing with her-and assembled researchers his logical searchings into the phenomenon. And the work of Idabel and the Southern California State-Section of MUFON; under her guidance, continued with investigations of puzzling cases — the Coarsegold reports, the Vandenberg AFB case, Floyd Hallstrom's aerial sighting, the Inyokem-China (continued on page 19)"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"NEWS'N'VIEWS 1987 MUFON SYMPOSIUM WASHINGTON, D.C.

Maccabee, a physicist, and the National Board includes several prominent physical and social scientists. The local symposium was sponsored by the Aetherius Society, headed by \"His Eminence Sir George King.\" Hall, who was Assistant Director of the National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena (NICAP) in Washington, D.C., during the 1960s, said: \"What more of a tipoff do you need? In the old days, he used to refer to himself as 'George King of England.' . \"These clowns have a long track record of confusing the issue and inhibiting sensible people from speaking out because UFOs are made to seem a nonsense problem,\" Hall said. \"Their titles should ,be investigated, not accepted, at face value. 'Dr.' Frank E. Stranges, for example, has no legitimate degree in divinity or anything else that would justify his claim. He deliberately chose the name of his organization a long time ago to resemble that of NICAP. Then he used his phony title and deceptive organization to peddle wild stories. \"We investigated Stranges and many others of the same ilk in the past; their 'doctorates' typically came from notorious diploma mills or 'mail order colleges' and are obtainable by anyone for a fee. \"King is a typical example of what we used to call 'contactees,\" Hall said. \"They claim to have specially privileged contact with extraterrestrial beings and spend most of their time purveying pseudoreligious messages of how to save Humankind from itself.\" Now active in the Fund for UFO Research, Hall stressed that part of their goal is to better inform the public with reliable information about UFOs. \"In connection with that goal, it is our duty to identify the cultists and manure spreaders to the public,\" he said. The Fund is currently sponsoring an objective astronomical study of alleged artifacts on the Moon which have been written about in popular books as if they were placed there by extraterrestrials. \"Preliminary results indicate that the alleged artifacts are natural formations observed under differing light conditions, and the authors' imaginations embellish the unusual appearances.\""},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"Hall also noted that a new book titled Light Years is due for release in April by Atlantic Monthly Press. \"It is a glorification of patently phony UFO photographs taken — or fabricated — by one Billy Meier, who has been caught in so many dishonesties that it is difficult to imagine how anyone could take him seriously. He is another 'contactee' who claims to have messages from space people. Let the buyer beware.\" The Fund for UFO Research is not a debunker of serious UFO reports made by responsible people. Its position is that the hardcore unexplained cases constitute a genuine scientific mystery deserving of very careful study. Through its program of research grants, the Fund hopes to encourage such study. JAL 1628 NEWS RELEASE Walter N. Webb, a professional astronomer for the Mutual UFO Network, ; has challenged the explanation, offered by Philip J. Klass that Japan Air Lines verteran pilot ,Capt. Terauchi saw nothing more than the planet Jupiter and possibly Mars on the night of November 17, 1986 when the pilot reported to the F.A.A. the observation of 3 UFOs over Alaska, Mr. Klass' approach to \"solving\" some UFO sightings is highly questionable. He will select a prosaic natural phenomenon and then grossly exaggerate both what the phenomenon is capable of doing and what the witness imagined that it is doing. It cannot be disputed that the planet Jupiter appeared coincidentally in the approximate direction of the pilots initial sighting, nor that atmospheric effects can cause bright planets and stars to appear to move and change brightness, color and shape. Viewing planets from any moving vehicle can also cause these celestial objects to shift position. However, Mr. Klass ignored some crucial facts. Jupiter - or Jupiter and Mars together (which were separated by about 19 degrees) - does not in the slightest resemble the pilot's description of seeing 2 cylinders flying parallel to each other, each arrayed with rows of lights, and each rotating in an opposite direction. Nor does the third UFO's appearance fit the Jupiter hypothesis. The pilot at one time glimpsed this object as an oval silhouette looking much like a walnut with a protruding rim containing lights, and with a band through the middle. The pilot obviously was impressed by something of immense size, something that may have appeared simultaneously on the aircraft's radar. If it is assumed that the blip was not a false : weather target, planets do not show up on radarscopes. Furthermore, if press reports are accurate, the large object eventually dropped behind the plane far away from Jupiter's .position in the sky. And finally, planets do not just disappear in a clear sky as the UFOs were reported to have done. . Perhaps worst of all, the planet explanation makes a liar out of the Japan Air Lines pilot, a veteran with over 20 years experience, who must have been aware of the bright planet or star visible from his cockpit night after night last fall. Despite the pilot's apparently solid background and experience, his sighting may yet turn out to have some conventional explanation. But, in my opinion Captain Kenju Terauchi did not mistake Jupiter and/or Mars for the 3 UFOS he said he had observed. It is quite remarkable that Philip Klass, in his published claim, has contradicted or ignored the testimony of Jim Derry, FAA Security Manager and Paul Steucke FAA spokesman in Alaska, who interviewed the flight crew; Sam Rich, FAA controller on duty at the time of the sighting; and the other two flight crew members of JAL 1628, First Officer Takanori Tamefuji and Flight Engineer Yoshio Tsukuda. Webb is an astronomy consultant to the Mutual UFO Network, Inc. (MUFON), a scientific organization dedicated to resolving the UFO phenomenon headquartered in Seguin, Texas.

McCampbell is MUFON's Director for Research. Editorial contributions to the following article were also made by MUFON research specialist Joe Kirk Thomas. The disruption of radio reception and transmission has long been recognized as a corollary to UFO. sightings. In 1961, the National Investigations -Committee on Aerial Phenomena published a milestone document that included a lengthy table on cases involving electromagnetic interference. 1 Out of the total of 126 cases, 24 pertain to radios. Dr. Adolf Schneider in West Germany has been collecting EM cases for years and has published a most useful computer printout with coded indices for each type of interference and references to sources in the literature. As of March 31,1983, his file contained 1319 cases of which 310 pertained to radios. 2 It is not surprising that.214 of them were in vehicles from which so many UFOs are seen. Most cases of radio interference seem to break down into six categories where the interference lasts only as long as the sighting is in progress. These categories are: A. Reception is enchanced. B. Sounds become weaker. C. Radio becomes silent. D. Static is produced. E. A sequence of stations is tuned in. F. Some kind of coded signal is heard. Space does not permit.a review of cases from each category. Attention is called to two Type E cases, however, because they are so rare, puzzling, and potentially revealing. Late in the evening of August 21, 1980, Mrs. Megan Elliot was driving her 18-month old daughter, Renee, toward their home some 40 miles away. As her Honda Civic approached Lake Fork 12 Creek in East Texas, it was allegedly lifted off the. highway and drawn up through a hole in a large metallic craft. Of primary relevance to the present inquiry was the effect on the car radio. She had been listening to the radio to stay awake when suddenly it \"...began to do weird things — acting like it was flipping back and forth but not stopping at the channels.— as if somebody was messing with my radio.\" It seemed to be changing stations although she had not touched the dial. 3 A similar episode took place at 2:30 a.m. on October 20, 1973. Bill Glaubitz and his girlfriend, Debby Johnson, were driving through snow from Calgary to Medicine Hat, British Columbia. Near Stathmore, the highway and field suddenly became brightly illuminated over a large area. They spotted a bright, saucer-shaped object in a field. It was glowing orange and flames appeared to be going around the middle. Bill left the car to take pictures and then got back in and watched for. about 5 minutes before driving on. They had been listening to CKXL in Calgary when \"...all kinds of channels, stations, started coming in all of a sudden.\" He later explained that \"...a bunch of stations came in. There was one, I think, Vancouver CFUN. That one came on for a while, then another one and it was all mixed up. Then it all went off and we listened to Calgary again.\" CKXL in Calgary, a 10,000 watt station at 1140 khz, was about 33 miles away.. CFUN in Vancouver, a 50,000 watt station at 1410 khz, was about 450 miles away. It should be noted that the initial station change was in the direction of higher frequencies. 4 MAGNETIC FIELDS Details in many UFO reports indicate the presence of magnetic fields. Compasses spin or go haywire and residual magnetism has been induced in steel objects such as flagpoles and road signs. Magnetic fields have also been specifically detected with instruments at least twelve times. 5 A highly significant study in France in 1974 searched for possible correlations between the appearance of UFOs and the disturbances of the earth's magnetic field. A research station near Orleans has been monitoring the horizontal components and declination of the geomagnetic field since 1886. The earth's field, about 0.4 gauss, is sensed to an accuracy of 10- 5 gauss. As the sensor's bandwidth is a few hertz, rapidly pulsing fields would not have been registered. The records showed a broad peak of magnetic disturbances correspond- ing to a sharper peak of UFO sightings, during the famous French \"flap\" of 1954. Fourteen significant changes in the field from October 1 through 18 coincided with UFO observations at distances from 25 to 100 kilometers from the station. Based on variations in • the vertical component, the investigator calculated the magnetic field in the immediate vicinity of the UFOs to be as high as 1890 gauss. 6 It seems natural to ask if magnetic fields associated with UFOs might be capable of producing the reported interference when at short range. Since a direct assault on this problem promised to be expeditious and convincing, a series of tests were conducted in which operating radios were exposed to magnetic fields and the effects observed. PROBE & CRADLE A bar magnet of appreciable strength was borrowed from Paul Cerny, MUFON Western States Director. It was of convenient size, being about 4 and % inches long with a rectangular cross section of 1\" x '/£\". (continued next page)"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"SIDE VIEW Not to scale. END VIEW MAGNET FID.!. MAGNET AND CRADU MUFON Research Specialist Joe Kirk Thomas calibrated the magnet in a commercial electromagnetics laboratory in Los Angeles. The magnetic field was mapped out to approximately three inches in each direction, expressed as contours for field strengths of 500,300,150, 50, and 15 gauss. The author measured the distances to the contour lines along the major axis and plotted the data on semilog paper. A calibration curve was then drawn through the data points. For any given distance in centimeters from the pole faces on the axis, one could read from the curve the corresponding magnetic field in gauss: The center of both north and south poles of the magnet were 1150 gauss. The corners of the north pole were 1550 gauss, while the corners of the south pole varied from 1450 to 1750 gauss. Preliminary tests had shown that the distance between magnet and radio was critical, especially in the range of 1 cm or less, due in part to the steepness of the calibration curve. A close control was therefore required in positioning the magnet and in measuring the distances. A special cradle was made by gluing a 12-inch wooden ruler at right angles to another strip of wood of about the same dimensions. The centimeter scale on the ruler was positioned next to the 90 degree groove and surplus wood was sanded off the end down to the zero mark. With the magnet lying in the groove, the distance could be read directly from the exposed scale. A Y^ inch-diameter, threaded steel rod with four nuts spread about 4 inches was next glued into the groove. Rotating the rod thrust the magnet forward at a slow and controllable rate. Because the magnet was so strong, its attraction to the steel rod maintained contact upon retraction, even in the vertical position. The arrangement is shown in Figure One. The accuracy of the scale was checked against a steel machinist's rule and found to be off .by 2.1%. MEASUREMENTS The modus operand! is simp|e. Turn on a small transistor radio, tune to a favorite station, and set the volume to a comfortable level. Then maneuver a moderately strong magnet around close to the back cover. One will immediately notice that the program fades away when the magnet is at certain locations. By removing the back, one can find out which electrical components are responding to the applied field and which are immune. One of the first questions to arise is whether the batteries lose power in a magnetic field, as that could explain the loss . of signal. Measurements were made on several batteries in general use. As the magnet was gradually brought close to the battery,, a momentary contact was made to measure the battery voltage with a Model NH-65 Mura Meter with a parallax mirror. To prelude magnetic interference with the meter, it was removed 19-inches away at an angle of 45 degrees from the magnet axis. Battery types included a NEDA 1604 9- volt battery for calculators and transistor radios and 1.5-volt AA and C cells for flashlights, toys, and transistor applications. All batteries produced their rated voltages with magnetic fields applied to their sides of up to 1150 gauss and slightly higher. As weaker fields will interfere with radios, one must look elsewhere to find electronic components that are. sensitive to magnetic fields. RADIO SHACK PROJECT 117 Of special value in these experiments is an educational toy sold by Radio Shack. 7 It contains numerous electronic parts permanently mounted on a circuit board. A manual is supplied to show the user how to hook up 150 different electronic devices. The unique feature is that the components are dispersed over an area of 10\" x 15\" with each one separated from its neighbor by at least %\". As there are many more parts than are used for any one of the 150 circuits, the components for a particular circuit are even further separated. As a result the unit is ideal for exposing individual components to magnetic fields while minimizing interaction with neighboring components. A rather simple radio circuit, Project 117, \"Two Transistor Radio with Transformers,\" was hooked up on the board. (For electronic experts, the radio consisted of an antenna tank circuit and a germanium detector followed by a two transistor transformer coupled amplifier). A 10- foot aluminum tube was used as an antenna and the set was grounded to household water pipes. Even so, the audio output to the earphone was quite weak. The earphone was therefore bypassed with the signal being fed to a Bogen Model DB110G monaural audio amplifier driving a GE 12-inch Midrange Loudspeaker. This arrangement produced acceptable sound. Unfortunately, tuning of the circuit was gross. Strong stations dominated excessive ranges on the dial, which was not adequately calibrated to identify the stations. Tests with the Kit quickly showed 13"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"which components were not sensitive to magnetic fields within the range of values being used. They were resistors, capacitors, variable capacitors, transistors, miniature audio transformers, and the loudspeaker that was temporarily wired in. The only component in this circuit that responded was the antenna coil. To determine the minimum magnetic field that can produce a noticeable effect on the antenna coil, the magnet was placed in its cradle and slowly pushed toward the coil. When a station was noticed to be fading, the distance between the pole face and the coil was read. The magnet-cradle assembly could then be removed and then reapplied to check if there was a small change in volume. If so, one could have overshot the point where fading began. As a subjective judgement is required, these measurements are not precise. Repeated trials gave a considerable spread in the measured distances. So all measurements were made three times and their average value used to enter the calibration curve for determining the magnetic field. RESULTS A popular AM station, KNBR at 680 kilohertz, was set at moderate volume. The sound began to fade at 410 gauss and was completely suppressed at 660 gauss. Pushing the magnet to touch the coil had no further effect. Then a weird thing happened. In repeating the experiment by bringing the magnet in from afar, the volume increased! It went from mezzo forte to fortissimo. Repeated tests showed that this effect is unmistakable. The magnetic field required to produce the maximum sound was 620 gauss. These and other measurements on the Kit are given in Table 1. From the Table one can see that fading of a station may begin at an average of 355 gauss and be silenced at an average of about 780 gauss. As the magnet was moved towards the coil in Series 3, the radio tuned to a sequence of stations. After signal loss from the original station, another came on in Spanish, next a revival preacher, then classical music. Furthermore, the 14 TABLE 1.

Not observed. May have started test with magnet too close. b. Not observed as steady decrease from maximum. selectivity of the Kit had been notably improved. In another series of experiments it was possible to measure the applied fields and to identify the station in a sequence. A backup radio was required to establish what station was being heard. For that purpose, a high quality receiver was used, a NOVA-TECH CB Direction Finder Citizen Band Receiver. This unit has four bands, including \"broadcast.\" When a new station was heard on the Kit, it could be identified on the NOVA-TECH whose tuning scale would accurately show the broadcast frequency. A listing of local stations then clearly pinpointed the call letters. Table II summarizes the results. An evangelist was tuned on KOFY at 1050 kilohertz. When the magnet was advanced to 1.5 cm, corresponding to 330 gauss, a new station was found to be broadcasting piano music. By checking the NOVA-TECH that station was identified as KIBE at 1220 hertz. Next, a field of 730 gauss shifted the tuning to classical music on KKHI on 1550 khz. This data presents an opportunity to calculate the sensitivity of the detuning effect. Columns are included to show the changes in the magnetic fields, dB, corresponding to the changes in resonant frequencies, dF. The sensitivities are expressed as the ratios of these quantities and are found to be 2.1 and 0.94 kilohertz/gauss. As these figures are approximate .one can only say that the shift in tuning is somewhere near 1500 hertz per applied gauss. Note that this effect is positive in the sense that an increase in the magnetic field shifts the tuning to higher frequencies. PANASONIC TESTS Another series of experiments were undertaken with a hand-sized transistor radio, the Panasonic Model R-1029. Its circuit, . being more complicated than that of the Kit, pulled in more stations with greater selectivity. (A circuit diagram was not available, but it appeared to have four radiofrequency amplifier stages and one audio stage with push-pull transistors driving an output transformer). Upon bringing the magnet toward the antenna coil, the volume did not increase. With stronger fields, the sound faded according to data in Table III. The last column shows that the results are roughly comparable to those for the Radio Shack Kit with the Panasonic being more sensitive to initial fading but more resistant to silencing. In the Panasonic, additional components such as tunable RF transformers (MITSUI 1-2B 451M FNH8) were found to respond. They TABLE II.

The radio could be silenced by magnetic fields on these transformers, but no station changes were observed since the selection occurs at the antenna end of the circuit. Numerical data is given, in Table IV. Data for the onset of fading in this series proved to be.closely reproducible as the maximum disparity of any reading from the grand average was only 8.5%. The cause for greater dispersion for silencing in the second column is not known. NOVA-TECH TESTS The NOVA-TECH used as a backup has a sophisticated circuit. The diagram, parts layout, and parts list in the instruction manual indicate four oscillator coils or transformers. Because they are part of a complex tuning circuit, they are expected to be very sensitive. In one test, fade-out began at 87 gauss and was complete at 255 gauss. Repeated trials showed some interference in the form of noise by magnetic fields as low as 30 gauss based upon extrapolation of the calibration curve by the inverse cube law. These oscillator coils were also very effective in detuning through a sequence of stations. After adjusting the tuning for a selected station, five additional stations were tuned in by magnetic fields of 295, 340, 350, 400, and 406 gauss. INTERPRETATION The tuning tank consists of a capacitor and inductor (coil) in parallel. Electrons flowing in the coil flow onto the parallel plates of the capacitor, causing a voltage to appear across it. This voltage opposes the flow of electrons onto the plates, and at some point the flow will peak and reverse 310 930 270 1240 355 780 itself until no charges are on the plates. The charge on the plates will again build, but in the opposite polarity since the direction of the electron flow has been reversed. In such a manner electrons in the \"tank\" will oscillate back and forth until their energy has been dissipated, usually in resistive heating of the wire from which the coil is wound. The frequency of oscillation is set by the product of the capacitance and the inductance of the capacitor and coil respectively.. The inductance is a function of the number of turns, dimensions and \"permeability\" (a measure of the extent to which the core can be magnetized by an external magnetic field). When the signal from an antenna is placed on the tank, frequencies far from its \"resonate\" frequency have little effect. A signal whose frequency is very close to that frequency will cause the circuit to oscillate. This is the process by which the .radio is tuned. Changing the \"resonate\" frequency of the tuning tank is usually accomplished by varying the capacitance of the capacitor. Alternatively, the inductance can be varied by changing, for example, the permeability of the coil core. One way in which this can occur is to subject the core to an external magnetic field. 8 Consider a circuit in a radio that is tuned to some station. As an external magnetic field is applied, the inductance of the coil will change and the resonate frequency begins to shift away from that of the broadcast station with which it was previously in resonance. This causes a reduction in the sound level. As the magnetic field increases, the volume continues to grow weaker and weaker. Eventually, the station can no longer, be heard as the.antenna circuit has been completely detuned away from it although the dial had never been touched. Still further increases in the field extend the changes until a neighboring station is picked up and so on as experimentally observed. AM radios are notoriously noisy between stations. If the magnetic field were varied at a slow rate, say 1 or 2 times per second, the sound volume would vary up and down at the same rate and could aptly be reported as \"pulsing.\" CODED SIGNAL RECEPTION So far the author has shown that subjecting a radio to an external field can produce the initial enchancement of reception (Type A), followed by weakening of the sounds (Type B), silence (Type C), static arid noise (Type D), and finally a sequence of stations being tuned in (Type E). But what about the occasionally reported reception of coded signals (Type F)? Table V shows three stereotypical cases of this type. 9 We will look first at Case 1 which involved a standard AM radio. Radios cannot ordinarily be tuned to stations outside the band of frequencies for which they were designed. A standard AM receiver, for example, will tune stations from 535 to 1605 kilohertz, the band allocated by the Federal Communications Commission to commercial AM stations. The limits of the radio's band.is usually determined principally by the range ,oyer which the capacitance can be changed. But under the abnormal conditions postulated here in close encounters, where the inductance may also change, they can operate outside their band. Recalling the sequential tuning experiment, it can be seen from Table II that the full .extent of .detuning amounted to 500 kilohertz. That is nearly half the whole broadcast band! A radio tuned to a station near the high frequency end of the dial could, when subjected to a strong magnetic field, move right out of the broadcast band. What lies just above the broadcast band? As of 1969, the region from 1605 to 1800 kilohertz was allocated to \"FIXED, MOBILE, AERONAUTICAL RADIO NAVIGATION, and radio location\" (lower case letters indicate secondary service that must not interfere with primary services). 10 Under \"radio location,\" LORAN A 15"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"TABLE IV.

It is aLongRange Navigation system using special receivers that compare the time of arrival of signals broadcast simultaneously from a pair of widely spaced transmitters. The allocation for AERONAUTICAL RADIO NAVIGA- TION is still valid but seldom used since air navigation shifted to the VHP band.\" One might suspect that continually repeated letters heard on the radio might be traced to some radio navigation system just outside the commercial band. Marine radio- beacons might be the source of such signals. The Coast Guard maintains about 200 beacons that broadcast coded letters in the 208 to 385 kilohertz band on the West Coast. Their range is about 150 nautical miles, and they broadcast one or two, or rarely, three letters every 50 seconds followed by a 10 second dash. Low powered Markerbeacons used for homing into harbors have ranges of 20 miles and many emit single letters. 12 It is not known, however, how an AM radio could detune to frequencies below its normal band. Cases 2 and 3 involve police radios. An inquiry here encounters a historical problem of enormous complexity as such communication systems have undergone drastic changes since World War II. Wartime research perfected equipment operating at higher frequencies that opened many thousands of new channels for communication. As the new equipment became available, police communications shifted into the VHP (30-300 megahertz) and UHF (300-3000 megahertz) bands. 13 While police communications have shifted into the VHP so have radio navigation aids. As part of an elaborate system, OMNIRANGE (VOR), all major airports broadcast a three letter identifier in Morse Code on assigned frequencies. 14 The three letters are familiar to airline passengers whose luggage tags use them to show destinations. Many additional stations are scattered throughout the countryside. VOR signals are broadcast in the range of 108.2 to 111.8 megahertz on even tenths. The nearest police frequency on the low side is 45.640 megahertz, while on the high side, it is 154.650 megahertz. 15 Detuning of modern crystal controlled police radios sufficiently to receive VOR signals seems to be unlikely. SUGGESTIONS Radio interference cases have the potential for revealing data on the TABLE V.

On the south side of Lake Michigan Case 1 2 3 16 magnetic fields of UFOs. Field investigators should have in their tool kits a calibrated magnet and a means of accurately measuring distance from the pole faces. Great care should be taken in cases of radio interference to establish the manufacturer, type, and model number. The station to which it was tuned should be recorded. 16 The interference should be carefully described and the souce of any extraneous signals should be found. By applying the magnet to sensitive components, the investigator should try to duplicate the radio performance during the sighting. By measuring the distance from the magnet and referring to a calibration curve, the magnetic field of the UFO at the radio can be estimated. It is obviously important to note the distance to the UFO, its orientation, and how the interference was related to its maneuvers. Several of the cited references could prove quite helpful to investigators of future radio interference cases. ADDENDUM FOR PHYSICISTS Electromagnetic resonance phenomena require a combination of a magnetic field and electromagnetic radiation. The resonant frequency for absorption of radiant energy depends in a known manner on the magnetic field strength. Hence approximate values of the magnetic field established above place corresponding limits on radiation frequencies that could resonate EM systems. Such knowledge may be useful regarding electron spin resonance (ESR) that is though to play a role in increasing the resistivity of transition elements, such as tungsten filaments in electric lights. 17 In addition, there are strong theoretical grounds for suspecting that nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) is related to antigravitational phenomena. 18 REFERENCES AND FOOTNOTES 1.

Box 64383 St; Paul, MN 55164-0383 $9.95 By John Schuesslcr, MUFON's deputy director. Extra-Terrestrials Among Us is a book that some people will love, while many of the hardcore Ufologists will tear it to shreds. George Andrews seems to have more than a passing interest in UFOs, extraterrestrials, and other mysteries adjunct to the UFO phenomenon. He begins the book on a very positive note by revealing the cover-up story in Greenwood and Fawcett's Clear Intent, followed by the work of France's official UFO investigative agency GEPAN. He provides coverage of some very substantial UFO cases, thereby building the case for something very strange happening in the world around us. His treatment of the official United States E.T. Law is good because he quotes it verbatim. Readers will welcome this bit of information. My own bias is not in favor of the ancient astronauts theory, so when Andrews shifts to the historical section titled \"From Deep Antiquity to Modern Times,\" I felt he weakened his case for extraterrestrial visitations. This section is interestingly presented, with some new viewpoints mixed in with the same material as presented by Erich Von. Daniken. The extraterrestrial premise is damaged further by a detailed look at pyramid construction. While it is nice to imagine extraterrestrial constructors of the pyramids; pyramidologists have already done a credible job of explaining the details of the construction and the people who did the work. Critters in flying saucers were not required to get the job done. SUICIDES The section of suicides mimics the feelings of many ufologists, even though they will never admit that fact in public. I have heard similar discussions within private groups of ufologists for the past 10 to 20 years. Unfortunately, Andrews could have made this section more hard-hitting if he had covered fewer alleged suicides, but in greater detail. Omitting non-UFO material such as the Karen Silkwood case would also have been a strengthening factor. The chapter on \"Mysterious Mutilations\" should be exanded into a book devoted to that subject, because the mutilation activity is so complex that a chapter does not do it justice. While Andrews covers a lot of interesting material in \"Space Tribes Signal,\" the chapter leaves a lot to be desired. His glimpse of the work of Leonard Stringfield is credible, but is too shallow to give the reader a full insight into the significance of the crash case, investigations. A number of abduction cases recorded by other authors provide detailed descriptions of humanoids and the interiors of their craft. Andrews ignored most of the better cases and devoted his space instead to a long dissertation that could be easily described as \"split personality.\" Extra-Terrestrials Among Us is a potpourri of information. It has some strong points, but these are diluted by the addition of spurious information about fish-falls and spontaneous combustion. For that reason it will be difficult for the publisher to target a specific market. The novice will probably find the book inspiring in many ways. On the other hand the critics will seek to protect the unspoiled minds of the novices and call for further censorship of this type of material. Most seasoned ufologists will find very little new material in this book and will probably tend to ignore it. Perhaps the best feature of the book is that it keeps the UFO mystery alive and open for scrutiny. Andrews has certainly drawn a new battle line. RESEARCH FUNDING By Richard Hall Richard Hall is Secretary- Treasurer of the Fund for UFO Research, Director of Publications for MUFON, and Consulting Editor to CUFOS. Contributions to the Fund for UFO Research are tax deductible. In the absence of Government- sponsored UFO research (at least, research that the Government is willing to share with the people), the only alternative available in a free enterprise society is to do it ourselves. Given the state of the economy, it is unrealistic to expect industry to do much of anything unless they can find a profit potential, so that leaves We the People. Public spirited corporations, however, ought to consider finding ways to provide seed money for UFO research, since the implications of UFOs affect all of society. As a nonprofit, tax exempt organization dedicated solely to providing the necessary money to qualified researchers, the Fund for UFO Research (Box 277, Mt. Rainier, MD 20712) is a vehicle for channeling funds to accomplish worthwhile projects. The Fund complements the work of the Mutual UFO Network (MUFON) and the Center for UFO Studies (CUFOS), which provide ongoing research, investigation, and information dessemination services for their members. Research or educational grants by the Fund are made to individuals without regard to their organizational affiliations. PROJECTS In the past year, the Fund has sponsored investigation and research projects on the UFO crash/retrieval issue and UFO \"abduction\" reports, as well as historical research and other (continued next page) 17"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"RESEARCH, Continued topics. The final report on a psychological study of UFO abductees, by Dr. Aphrodite Clamar et al., was released in 1985 (including the sending of copies to major psychology societies), with the highly significant findings — after study by well-qualified professional psychologists — that UFO abductees 'are essentially normal people who display the symptoms of \"victims,\" not \"crackpots.\" A major catalogue of UFO abduction cases, with analyses of recurring patterns and significant features, has been compiled by Edward Bullard under a Fund research grant, and this .massive document will be released in 1986, along with a complementary study by Michael Frizzell conducted independently. Together, these two reports will become sourcebooks and provide guidance for all future studies of abduction reports. They will provide an overview of the nature and scope of the UFO abduction question, which should stimulate further research. A major study of the 1896-97 \"mystery airship\" reports in the U.S., by Robert G. Neeley, Jr., is in an advanced stage and is expected to be released in 1986. Research support from the Fund enabled Mr. Neeley to travel extensively throughout the U.S. to visit major libraries and depository sites and to obtain a large amount of new information, despite the fact that several other people have already conducted fairly comprehensive research on this topic. The resulting catalogue and analysis should be the most definitive study yet conducted of what might be called the first wave of UFO sightings in the U.S. If, in fact, there is a conventional explanation for the reports, the information compiled by Mr. Neeley will be an important factor in resolving the question. WORLD SCOPE In parallel with the U.S. study, the Fund has recently approved a grant to a team of British investigators to compile and analyze data on \"mystery aircraft\" reports in the British Isles early in the 20th Century. This study also got 18 underway during 1986. Another project funded over the past two years and expected to result in a final report during 1986 is an update (considerably expanded) of the study by V.J. Ballester-Olmos of Iberian Peninsula (Spain and Portugal) UFO cases involving physical effects — otherwise known in the Close Encounter (CE) terminology developed by the late Dr. J. Allen Hynek as CE-II cases. The original catalogue of Iberian Peninsula CE-II cases was published by CUFOS in 1976. Again, the expanded data collection and analysis is expected to provide a clearer picture of the nature and scope of CE-II cases worldwide. ' Ballester-Olmos, a computer engineer in Spain, currently serves as Editor-in-Chief of UPIAR Research in Progress (a multi-lingual journal of UFO research published in Italy) and is the recipient of a previous award by the Fund for his role in the production of an international, scientifically referred journal. URIP (the acronym for the above publication) provides a current awareness service of ongoing UFO research to an international audience. A long-time goal of the Fund has been to encourage UFO research projects in the college/university community, to provide funding for graduate and post-doctoral level studies. Colleges and universities potentially are a major contributor to UFO research. A proposal from a graduate student in astronomy currently is being evaluated by the National Board, and thus it is premature to talk about it. PUBLIC SUPPORT The Fund, over the past few years, also has received inquiries or proposals from documentary film makers and others regarding major projects that are presently beyond the existing financial resources. This is mentioned in order to illustrate that there is no lack of people willing to do the work we would all like to see accomplished — if only the funds were available. You the People — if you want to see progress in UFO research — must not wait for the Government to enlighten you or it will be a long wait. Support your UFO research/ investigation organization and publication of choice, which will keep you informed of UFO information past and present. And support the basic research projects of the Fund for UFO Research which will benefit all individuals and organizations.

McCampbell REMEMBERED, Continued phenomena; the Tujunga Canyon contacts. Leading investigators in the field, from other cities and states, came to frequent dinner meetings at the Epperson home. The only excuse Idabel and Marilyn ever needed to give a \"meeting-party\" was the fact that a fine researcher would be passing through Los Angeles — Allen and Mimi Hynek, James M. McCampbell, David Saunders, Richard Hall, Isabel Davis, Ted Bloecher, Paul Cerny, Tom Gates, and Walt Andrus — a myriad of contributors in the field, so numerous that they cannot all be named and an apology is made here for any deletion. They know who they are, they know the multiple talents Idabel Epperson had contributed for long decades. We will never forget her. POST SCRIPT I want to talk about my Mother. A loving mother, wife, homemaker, and my teacher are my earliest memories of her. She had many talents that even you, dear friends, may be unaware of— talents such as drawing, singing, piano playing, dancing and professional costume -designing. She always had many friends. She loved to bring people together to share their interests and enjoy life. She was very successful with public relations and as a recreational director for tennis clubs. She was also active in civic affairs from time to time. She was a good public speaker and writer. She has been very courageous, forcing a frail body to meet many challenges. Most of you are aware of her thirty plus years investigating UFO sightings and making the scientific community, as well as the general public, aware of the phenomenon. Again, she brought many wonderful people together to share their knowledge. Above all, however, she was MOTHER, spelled in capital letters. She was the kind of Mother who was always there when I arrived home from school; who was aware of my worries and concerns and provided the solutions, and who gave her all to help me reach my goals. I will miss her intuitive insights and her sage advice. \"The heart remembers all those precious moments when a Mother's special love made all the difference.\" Although we are taught to say \"she was\" when referring to the deceased, I find myself wanting to say \"she is,\" for she still lives, geographically separated from me, from us all, but always close in thought and spirit, and always loved and loving in return. Truly, Mother, you have earned your wings. You are free and our love follows you into eternity. -Marilyn I. Epperson MESSAGE, Continued phenomenon. It is scheduled to be released in April or before. We can enthusiastically recommend the books by Budd Hopkins and Whitley Strieber. It has been predicted that major strides in Ufology will occur during 1987. If Ufology is to immerge with scientific answers to the \"greatest mystery of the space age,\" combating negative factors on both ends of the spectrum is imperative. This ranges from the debunking attempts by Philip Klass and his UFO sub-committee of CSICOP to The Atlantic Monthly Press and the supermarket weeky tabloids. 1987 will not only mark the fortieth anniversary of the modern era of UFOs, but it will be the most challenging period that Ufology has faced in order to achieve the scientific respectability that it deserves. There will be no place for the \"faint-hearted,\" but tremendous opportunities for scientists, engineers, academics and dedicated Ufologists \"to stand up and be counted.\" Do you accept this challenge? I UFO NEWSCLIPPING SERVICE The UFO NEWSCUPPING SERVICE will keep you informed of all the latest United States and World-Wide UFO activity, as it happens! Our service was started in 1969, at which time' we contracted with a reputable international newspaperrdipping bureau to obtain for us, those hard to find UFO reports (i.e., little known photographic cases, close encounter and landing reports, occupant cases) and all other UFO reports, many of which are carried only in small town or foreign newspapers. \"Our UFO Newsclipping Service issues are 20-page monthly reports, reproduced by photo-offset, containing the latest United States and Canadian UFO newsclippings, with our foreign section carrying the latest British, Australian, New Zealand and other foreign press reports. Also included is a 3-5 page section of \"Fortean\" clippings (i.e. Bigfoot and other \"monster\" reports).
