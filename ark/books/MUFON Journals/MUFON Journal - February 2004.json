Vshould head for the Valley of the Old Women in central Brazil. For at least half a century now, the val- ley has been one of the most active UFO regions in the world. Countless sightings have been reported over the years, and UFOs are still being seen there. Its proper name is Vale do Rio das Velhas, or the Valley of the River of the Old Women. The valley encompasses 10,750 square miles of cattle ranches and •\" farmland in low mountains and ? rolling hills in the ; 11 ^ j_/vV center of the state of Minas Gerais. The river has many small smaller i_ --^, , streams feeding it. H^A. •'/,' The system originates near the city of Ouro Preto, southeast of the state capi- tal, Belo Hori- zonte, and meanders north-northwest about five hundred kilometers before emptying into the Rio Sao Francisco, one of Brazil's largest rivers. Just how much of the valley has been visited by UFOs is not known. To our knowledge, UFO investigators have searched only a small portion of the val- ley, but that research has yielded rich re- sults. Members of the Belo Horizonte UFO group CICOANI have gone to the valley hundreds of times since the late 1960s, documenting about 1,500 sightings and encounters. The valley has proved to be irresistible to us too. Some encounters took place as long ago as the 1950s, and some just two to three months before our visit. We learned later that there were sightings after we left. Sao Vicente is a small town about fifty kilometers in a straight line north of Belo Horizonte but about one hundred kilo- meters by car. Three veteran investigators who live Bob Pratt in Sao Vicente, Ivan Leoncio Scares, Jose Cimalia, and Maria Mercia Rodrigues, worked with us. Ivan is a former profes- sional soccer player and a retired police officer, Jose is a businessman, and Mercia is a mathematics teacher. Altogether, we looked into 26 cases, many of them with two or more witnesses. Most of the people reported seeing a big ball of light in the sky that lit up every- thing around it. Frightened mother Most of the people we talked to were frightened during their encounters. In 1991, Celsa de Fatima Scares, now 44, had one of the most terrifying incidents. She is a cook at Fazenda dos Poc5es and lives about ten kilometers from the farm. \"It was around 11 or 11:30 at night and I was going home in a pickup truck with my eight-year-old son and my baby,\" Celsa said. \"The baby was eight months old.\" She had to park the truck some dis- tance from her house because the house is in the woods and there was no drive- way. \"I was getting down from the truck, had a sack over my shoulder, held the boy \"with one hand and my baby in my other arm,\" she said. \"As we started down the path toward the house, a light ap- peared in the sky ahead and lit up the ground all around us. I panicked and started running, pulling my boy with me and juggling my baby and the sack. I couldn't go very fast. \"We had to run through a lot of dense bushes and then over a log bridge over a stream. The light was going up and down, up and down, and it was right behind us. I thought it was chasing us. I really wanted to get away from it. \"I ran past a big tree and finally got to the veranda of my house and was scream- ing at my husband. I looked back and the light was right above that big tree, only fifteen meters away. \"It was red like fire. It was 50 to 60 centimeters in diameter in the beginning, but was getting smaller, maybe 35 to 40 centimeters. By the time my husband came out, it had gone away. It just went out and disappeared.\" Celsa said she is afraid to go out at night anymore. \"I always look to see if About the investigators This article was written by Bob Pratt in collaboration with Cynthia Luce, Tom Tulien, and Vera Filizzola. It is based on interviews the four of them had with UFO witnesses in May, 2003. Bob, a veteran journalist and UFO researcher, is the author of UFO Dan- ger Zone-Terror and Death in Brazil, as well as Night Siege, The Hudson Valley UFO Sightings, which he co- authored with Dr. J. Allen Hynek and Philip Imbrogno. He is a former editor of the MUFON UFO Journal. •arrpT-^a Cynthia is an Ameri- r .. \"^ can researcher of anoma- ^ -'.-a '..tf,<ul lous phenomena who has lived in Brazil since the 1970s. Tom lives in Minne- apolis, MN, and is a founder of the Sign Oral History Project, the pur- pose of which is to pre- serve important historical information and to make it available for scholarly study. Vera is a native Brazilian, living most of her life in Belo Horizonte. She has long been interested in UFOs and other paranormal phenomena and has a website, http://www.- jornalinfinito.com.br/. The interviews were conducted while Cynthia, Tom, and Bob were guests at Vera's farm. there's a light around and I'm always ready to run if I see one. My brother Wil- son saw a light one night shortly after that and he had to stay hidden in the bushes all night long because he couldn't get away from the light.\" Couple terrified The fear that these objects induced seems to be common in such encounters. For Silvandina Martins, such an encoun- ter was the most terrifying event in her life. One evening in 1993, she and her hus- band Raimundo, both then in their mid- sixties, had walked from their home in Sao February 2004 MUFON UFO Journal Page3"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Vicente to a friend's farm three kilometers to the north. The friend had butchered a hog and the Martins bought a piece of it. As they were walking back home with the pork in a basket about 10:30, a bright light appeared in the sky and came to- ward them. \"We were afraid and we started running,\" Silvandina said. As they ran, Raimundo abruptly fell down, and the light flew directly over them. Silvandina was terrified and thought he had died. \"Oh, my God, I lost my husband,\" she told herself, but Raimundo quickly got back up, and they continued running. \"We found a tree with vines around it and hid under the vines. It was the color of fire, very strong. Everything was so bright. Everything was lit up and the light kept going around and around above us. We heard a noise, like a low buzzing sound.\" Sometimes the light hovered directly above their hiding place. The tree was about ten meters tall, and the light was just above the tree. \"I was so afraid I wet my pants,\" Silvandina said. \"I am not ashamed. All my clothes were wet. I kept thinking, 'I am going to die. I am going to die.' \" A few minutes later the light disap- peared, and the couple went on home. But Silvandina was depressed for two weeks and finally went to a doctor for help. \"I have never gone outside at night since then,\" she said. Asked if he goes outside at night, Raimundo said, \"Yes, but I stay close to home. When friends ask me to go fishing with them, I say no.\" Object on the road One of the more curious encounters occurred when a 57-year-old dairy farmer named Mozart Jose de Alencar was driv- ing home one night. Just as he was going over a hill he saw 12 to 15 cars, trucks and motorcycles parked in the highway just ahead of him. Most of the drivers and passengers were standing looking at a brightly glow- ing object on the ground a hundred meters or so beyond them. It was shaped like an upside down washbasin, and was the size of a car or truck. It appeared to be sitting on the pave- ment, and it glowed so brightly that ev- erything around was bathed in red light. \"It was all red,\" said Mozart when we interviewed him at his farm near Sao Vicente. \"The whole area was lit up.\" The object made no sound. No one seemed to be afraid, but no one knew what to ex- pect. About five minutes later, the object began to rise slowly into the air, still not making any sound. As it went up, it still glowed red, but now seemed to give off greenish rays. A few seconds later, the object circled around as it rose still higher, and a minute later it blinked off and dis- appeared. Mozart and the other people stood for a few minutes talking about what they had seen. \"We all thought it was a flying saucer.\" His sighting took place in 1997, but he doesn't remember what month. It hap- pened on the highway going from Baldim to Sao Vicente, five kilometers to the south. These accounts gave us a glimpse of the long-term presence of UFOs in the valley. What these people saw was more or less typical of what has been happen- ing in and around Baldim and Sao Vicente from the beginning, and may be typical of the entire valley. Swift light startles man Many of the lights that we heard about were described as being so bright that the shape of the objects behind them could not be determined. Such was the case in one of the most recent sightings. That sighting occurred about 10 o'clock one dark night last February as Cosme Rodrigues de Araujo was sitting in the doorway of his house on a farm near Sao Vicente. There was no moon. Cosme's sons, 10-year-old Henrique and 9-year-old Danilo, were sitting beside him. They were simply watching the sky in the west. \"I could see lots of stars, and then I saw a light coming in the sky,\" said Cosme, a 38-year-old farm worker. \"It was like the headlight on a car. It was bright and was all colors of the rainbow.\" The object flew swiftly toward them, but suddenly stopped just above some banana trees about 300 meters away. Cosme and the boys were so frightened that all three rushed inside the house. \"I wanted to get a knife,\" Cosme admitted. \"I felt I had to protect myself.\" He and his boys watched the light from a window. It made no sound. To Cosme, it appeared to be five to six meters in diam- eter as it hovered above the trees. About 15 seconds later, the light suddenly shot back in the direction from which it had come and vanished. \"It disappeared in seconds,\" said Cosme. Farm sightings common A number of sightings have occurred on or near Vera's farm. One of the earliest took place in the spring of 1986. The wit- nesses were Luciene Donata Gonfalves, then eight, and her brother Leonardo Malaquias Gonpalves, twelve. Their fa- ther is one of the managers of the farm. \"My brother and I were very young,\" said Luciene. \"About 9 or 10 o'clock one night, we saw a light had been left on in the corral, so we decided to go turn it off.\" The corral is 100 to 200 meters from the house where they lived. About half- way to the corral.is a gate. \"The minute we got to the gate, a bright light turned on above the corral,\" she said. \"It was about 30 meters above the silo and corncrib in the corral. It was about 50 centimeters in diameter, kind of bluish, and it was lighting up everything.\" When the light turned on, it frightened them so much that they ran back to their house as fast as they could. Her brother Leonardo, now one of Vera's sons-in-law, said, \"When we got to the house I turned around and could see the light was getting smaller. It looked Page 4 MUFON UFO Journal February 2004"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"like it pulled back and, was going away from us. It kept getting smaller and smaller, and then it went out completely.\" A sizzling sound Two or three months later that same year, 1986, Erlania Maria Elias, now 34, had a sighting within 400 meters of that same corral -as she was going home for the night. Now a cook for Vera's family, she was then a 17-year-old maid. \"It was about 8:00 at night and we had just finished fixing dinner for Dona Vera and her family,\" said Erlania. With her that night was Maria Pinto, then 15 or 16, who also worked in the house. \"We left and went out the gate near the veranda, and as we were passing a stand of eucalyptus trees, Maria said, 'Look, there's a light!' \" They continued walking through the trees, but seconds later they realized the light was getting bigger. \"We thought it must be a car stopped at the entrance to the farm, but Maria was scared and thought it might be a robber. The light was near the ground and then it started to go up into the air. We could hear a low sizzling sound. \"It was shaped like a washbasin, and everything around us was lit up. It was so bright we had trouble seeing. It started to go up. I turned to Maria and said, \"This is a flying saucer!' We started screaming and ran back to the house.\" Vera was still on the veranda and heard them screaming, but she didn't see the light. By then, the light had shrunk in size and soon disappeared. In almost half of the cases that we in- vestigated, witnesses heard a noise. All described the sound as like a low or soft sizzling, buzzing, or frying noise, and one said a whirring noise like a fan. Object chases two women In February, 1985, Vildevina Marques Moura, now 66 and living in Sao Vicente, heard such a sound. She had gone to a nearby village to sell wood to a relative. Her eight-year-old daughter Maristela was with her. It was about 4 o'clock in the afternoon, but the man who would pay for the wood wasn't there at the time. When he returned about 6 o'clock and Vildevina got her money, she and her daughter started walking home. She stopped for a few minutes at a friend's house near Sao Vicente. It was getting dark and her friend urged her to stay for the night, but Vildevina had to go because another child was waiting for them at home. Not long after they continued on their way home, a bright light suddenly ap- peared in the sky behind them. \"We thought it was a car and maybe would give us a ride,\" said Vildevina. \"But the light came up and passed right over our heads. We were very frightened. It seemed to-be going around and around above our heads.\" They started running, but Vildevina lost her sandals and fell down an embank- ment beside the road. Both of them scrambled up the bank and ran into the woods. \"We hid in the underbrush, and it was going around over our heads and it lit up the whole area. It was mak- ing all this noise, a low buzzing sound.\" The light was the size of a tire, and had come within 15 meters of them, she said. \"It was a black color with the light coming from the middle. It kept making that noise. It went off (northeast) toward Gentil. I will never go on that road again.\" Children hide beneath cow A more spectacular case occurred many years later in the village of Bau, 22 kilometers north of Sao Vicente. The wit- nesses were three other children, and their story came to us from Mercia Rodrigues, the math teacher and ufologist who lives in Sao Vicente. \"This happened on a moonlit night in January 1988,\" Mercia said. \"The children involved were Adriana Goulart, eight, and her bothers, Djalma, twelve, and Claudio, ten. I heard the story some months later when Adriana came to live with me and worked as a babysitter. \"The night this happened, these chil- dren had to walk across the countryside to a place about six. kilometers away. When they were walking through a pasture, a light appeared in the sky. Everything lit up. It was a very intense light of many colors. They were frightened. \"There was no place to hide, no trees or anything, but a .cow was standing nearby, and the three of them ran under- neath the cow. It was frightened too and the light came very close. The children clung to each other and stayed hidden under the cow as the light kept going around and around in a circle above them. The. cow was in a state of shock, and she just stood there the whole time, not moving. \"The children felt a lot of heat from the UFO, and Adriana said .the wind was so strong as the light circled around that the grass was blown sideways.\" Mercia said this went on for several hours before the light disappeared. \"They were there the whole time until it got light. There wasn't anybody around, nobody there, just them and the cow.\" Farmer burned While some witnesses believe UFOs chased them, Domingos Elias Lopes has no doubt about it, and it happened to him twice. He is a 68-year-old farmer whose farm is next to Vera's. \"I was coming home at midnight,\" he said, telling about the first incident, which took place in 1984. \"I saw a star crossing the sky from right to left. When I got close to (a neighbor's) gate I saw a light up on a hill like a car headlight. Then it came toward me and grew larger. Then every- thing around me got as bright as day. \"When it got closer, I could see it was shaped like an upside down washbasin. I jumped over a fence and hid in tall grass. The thing passed over me and everything went dark again. \"I jumped back over the fence and started walking in the road, but then I saw a tiny reddish light ahead of me. It would get bigger and smaller, and I thought it was a man coming toward me smoking a cigar. \"Then it became a big light again and started toward me, making a sizzling sound. I jumped over the fence again and hid under a tree.\" The light went out again, but Domingos stayed hidden until he heard a car coming. When it drew near, he jumped out into the road and stopped it. That frightened the driver, Jose Gazire, who had not seen the light and thought someone was going to rob him. But when he saw it was Domingos, he let him in and they drove off. Neither man saw the ob- ject after that. In the other encounter the object came even closer to him. \"That was ten or eleven years ago,\" Domingos said. \"It was about 8 o'clock at night, and I saw.a light in a soccer field not far from my home.\" Suddenly the light started rising into the air, making a low buzzing or sizzling sound. \"It was sort of a wheel of light, but like fire. It was shaped like a washtub turned over. It was coming toward me and I began running to get away from it. \"It was so close I could feel heat on my back. When I reached my home I was in such a hurry that I kicked the door open and broke it.\" His wife Dorvalina thought a thief was trying to break in. She armed herself with a club and started outside before realiz- ing it was her husband. She saw the light as it flew out of sight, making a sizzling February 2004 MUFON UFO Journal PageS"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"sound. The next day Domingos had blisters on his back, and later he came down with what ap- peared to be jaundice. Man dies after encounter To our knowledge, a jaundice- like illness is not common after being exposed to a UFO, but dur- ing our week in Sao Vicente we heard about two other such inci- dents. For Jose Edigio Vieira, then 70, a close encounter one night in July 1975 may have contributed to his death. He had worked that day de- livering bread for a bakery in Sao Vicente, assisted by a nephew, Jose Antonio Vieira, 13. Jose Antonio, now 41, said that about 11 o'clock that night as they were taking their horses to a pasture, \"A big light suddenly appeared in the sky. I asked Edigio what it was. He said, 'It must be a flying saucer!' It scared us, and we ran and hid in some bushes. \"It lit up the whole area. It looked like two plates, one upside down on the other. It kept going around and around in small circles just 12 to 15 meters above us. \"It made a whirring sound like a fan, and it was shining a greenish light down from the center. It stayed for half an hour or more and then it went away.\" When he and Edigio thought it was safe, they went back home, arriving about 12:30 in the morning. The next day Edigio woke up sick with symptoms of jaundice, and shortly after went to a hospital. \"He died in the hospital 15 days later,\" Jose Antonio said. \"The diagnosis was hepatitis.\" (Jaundice is often associated with hepatitis.) Sheriff a victim The victim in the other \"jaundice case\" was a sheriff in Funilandia, a town 18 ki- lometers west of Sao Vicente. The man is now dead, and the story came to us from Anterino Goulart da Silva, whose sight- ing in 1955 when he was seven and was playing with a brother and sister outside their house was described earlier. The sheriff's name was Jose Leiro, and Anterino, 17 at the time of the 1965 inci- dent, worked for him. \"Jose Leiro had in- vestigated the deaths of two men and was riding back home on his horse when a big light lit up above him,\" Anterino said. \"He was very much afraid. He jumped off his horse and hid in the bushes. \"The light was right above him and he stayed hidden until everything got dark again and he sensed the light had gone away. He got back on his horse and went home. But he got sick with jaundice and it was a long time before he got well.\" UFOs target families It was not unusual for several mem- bers of some families to have been wit- nesses in the same encounters. We also talked with several members of one fam- ily who all had encounters but none of them at the same time. Earlier Erlania Maria Elias told about her encounter when walking home one night with a friend, Maria Pinto. Then we heard about the two encounters that Erlania's father, Domingos, had-one of which left him with blisters on his back. And now we come to another incident involving Dorvalina Lopes, the wife of Domingos and the mother of Erlania. One night in 1985, Dorvalina and an- other daughter, Edna, then 15, were walk- ing across a field filled with dense bushes and trees. \"We saw a light way up high,\" said Dorvalina, now 67. \"It was small. People had been seeing a light circulat- ing in the region, and we were afraid. They said it comes right down on you. We ran to a big tree and the light was coming slowly down toward us. Edna said, 'Mama, there's a flying saucer coming! Let's run!' \"So we started running, and the light came after us, and Edna sprained her ankle on rocks in the ground. She was having a lot of pain. She was limping along and we got under a tree. We stayed there for ten or fifteen minutes, quiet. The light had gone out, so we started hobbling along from one tree to the next, but the light came on again and was jumping along with us. It was making a soft buzzing sound.\" After dashing from tree to tree for sev- eral minutes, they came to streetlights at the edge of a village, at which time the thing went away. Truck paced by UFO One man had a close encounter with a UFO even though he was speeding to get away from it. One morning hi early 2000, Joao Batista Pinto and his teenage son Juninho were driving in a pickup truck to a rented pasture four kilometers south of Sao Vicente. They kept some milk cows there. \"It was about 4:30-in the morning,\" said Joao, who also owns a small shop in Sao Vicente where he sells sandwiches and drinks. \"As we got near the farm I saw a light in the sky. It was quite far away, but 1 could see it was coming closer. \"I had to slow down to turn onto a side road, and at that moment the light passed right over us, and it looked like it landed on the road. I said, 'Let's keep going,' but Juninho didn't want to be- cause the light was there in the road ahead of us.\" Joao quickly turned around and started back toward Sao Vicente. The light had been on his left side before, and the next thing he knew, it had lifted off the ground, passed over the truck, and taken up a po- sition on his left side again. \"It was only three meters away from the truck. It was really close. It was round and there were rays of different lights going out of it. It was many different col- ors-green, red, blue-green. There was a rose color, and they varied in intensity. It would get bigger and smaller. I went faster, but it seemed like the faster I went the closer it would come.\" When they finally reached a gas sta- tion on the outskirts of Sao Vicente, the light went away. Joao and his son waited until daylight arrived and then went back to the farm to milk the cows. Hiding in an outhouse Some debunkers say anyone who sees a UFO is crazy or drunk. Dalton Castro isn't crazy, but he had been drink- ing the night of April 25, 1998, when he had a run-in with what apparently were two UFOs, one just above the other. \"A friend had died, and I was at a wake at his house,\" said Dalton, a 46- year-old factory worker. \"Sometime after midnight I left to go home. When I came out of the house I saw this big thing in the sky and it was coming closer. \"The center was bluish, and it was dull yellow around the edge-a flashing yel- low light. It was about 60 centimeters in diameter, and there was a smaller object just above it. It was blue. I was scared and I ran. I looked back and stopped, and it stopped too. I hid under a mango tree for a while and thought it had gone away. . \"But when I came out from under the tree, it came back again. So I ran down the street to an uncle's home, ran into the backyard, and hid in an outdoor toilet. After about a half hour, I peeked out, saw nothing, and went on home. \"But it came back again, and I could still see it from my porch. I stood watch- ing for a while and then they started go- Page 6 MUFON UFO Journal February 2004"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"ing up, up, up and then the two objects merged into one and disappeared.\" Dalton saw another blue UFO in 2001 when he and a friend were fishing in a stream five kilometers east of Sao Vicente. \"It was about 1 o'clock in the morning, and suddenly a big round blue light rose up out of the forest. It was about 50 cen- timeters in diameter. We got scared and began running. It chased us for a while, but when we got close to home it went up and disappeared.\" The smell of sulphur In only one case did anyone smell anything out of the ordinary. The wit- nesses, two women who are related by marriage, saw the same light, but from dif- ferent locations. Ivete Clemencia Felipe, 23 at the time, was alone in the home of a sister-in-law, Ana Lucia Felipe Silva, three kilometers from Sao Vicente. It was around 7 o'clock one evening in 1978 and the sky was dark. \"I looked out the window and saw a little blue light in the sky quite far away,\" Ivete said. \"Then it got bigger and turned reddish. It was moving faster and faster and coming closer. It was giving off flashes of light like fireworks. There were lots of different colors. \"I could hear a buzzing sound. It was going around and around. All the doors and windows were shut, but it lit up the inside of the house. I was so scared that I ran and hid under a bed.\" About the same time that Ivete first saw the light, her sister-in-law Ana Lucia, then 25, was walking home from a sewing class in Sao Vicente. She was within 40 meters of the gate in front of the house when the light appeared in the sky. A cousin, Eurico Aprigio, then 50, was with her at the time. \"We had taken a shortcut through woods, and when we came out of the woods we saw the light,\" Ana Lucia said. \"We thought it was a car with one light. We didn't see any shape, just a bright headlight coming toward us. It lit up ev- erything on the the road. It was coming toward us, and we started running. Eurico lost one of his sandals.\" Instead of trying to reach the house, they turned back and ran into a grove of trees. Afraid to leave the woods, they stayed hidden until about 10 PM before deciding it was safe to go on to Ana Lucia's home. We interviewed both women in Ivete's home, and both said they smelled an odor during the encounter. \"There was a smell of gas, like sulphur,\" Ana Lucia said. \"Yes, I forgot to say there was a smell of sul- phur,\" said Ivete. It is in- teresting to note that in five cases that oc- curred over an 18-year period, the U F O s circled around and around above the heads of the witnesses: Jose Edigio and his nephew Jose Antonio in 1975, Ivete and Ana Lucia in 1978, Vildevina and her daughter in 1985, 8-year-old Adriana Goulart and her two brothers in 1988, and Silvandina and Raimundo in 1993. Cattle ranch UFOs Many of the reports we received came from people living or working at Vera's farm, Fazenda dos Pofoes. Nearly all in- volved a very bright light in the sky. A typical sighting occurred about 11 o'clock one night in 1996. Tarci'sio Malaquias Goncalves, now 53, was in the main corral at the farm, artificially insemi- nating a cow. The farm has more than 600 cattle, and Tarcisio is in charge of them. He is also the father of Luciene and Leonardo Gon9alves, mentioned earlier in another sighting. \"I saw a light in the sky, and suddenly everything around me was lit up,\" Tarcisio said. \"I looked up and it was like a great headlight, very, very bright.\" A few min- utes later, the light disappeared. Tarcisio said none of the cattle in the corral re- acted to the light. The farm has two cor- rals. The main one is located next to a milk barn and several other buildings. Cattle are also milked at the other corral about two kilometers away. One night in early 2002, a bright light suddenly appeared in the sky above the second corral. The lone witness was Wanderley dos Santos Costa, a 25-year- old cowboy who was riding a horse on his way back to the corral. \"A cow had just given birth, and a man got hurt when the cow smashed him up against a fence,\" Wanderley said. \"I had taken him to be treated and was returning to the corral about 9:20 when I saw a bright light in the sky. It was a big ball of light that lit up everything below it.\" The cattle in the corral paid no atten- tion to the light, but Wanderley's horse was spooked. It bolted and took off run- ning. Wanderley simply loosened the reins and let the horse run until it calmed down. \"After about 20 minutes, the light went away.\" A special UFO valley Although there have been several sightings on or near Fazenda dos Popoes, the farm is not the center, of UFO activity in the Valley of the Old Women. For more than 30 years, Hulvio Brant Aleixo and members of the UFO group CICOANI investigated more than 1,000 cases all around Belo Horizonte, but pri- marily in the valley to the north. A list of their field trips includes the names of more than 150 towns, villages and hamlets- many so small they do not appear on maps of the state-and dozens of cattle ranches and farms. A humanoid encounter One of the strangest incidents in Bra- zilian ufology did occur in Vargem Grande, a village adjacent to Vera's farm. On the night of Sept. 9,1976, HermeUndo da Silva, the owner of a small roadside bar, tangled with a humanoid creature that slid down a cable dangling from a UFO. The crea- ture was stronger, and was able to slip a hook around Hermelindo's right ankle. Hermelindo was yanked off the ground and was being reeled up toward the UFO when his left foot hit the bottom of the UFO and knocked him loose as the UFO went away. An abduction Another incident, perhaps even bet- ter known, occurred near the village of Bebedouro, 20 kilometers south of Sao Vicente. On the afternoon of May 4,1969, a 24- year-old military policeman named Jose Antonio da Silva was fishing in a lagoon when he was overpowered by two small beings and forcibly taken aboard a UFO. He was released four and a half days later in a city far to the east. Another death More tragically, near the small town of Jabuticatubas, 27 kilometers southeast of Sao Vicente, a close encounter led to the death of Cecilio Higino Pereira, a farm worker. On the night of Aug. 9,1976,30-year- old Cecilio left Jabuticatubas with two neighbor women to walk to their homes near the hamlet of Barreira da Pacienca. On the way they saw a bright light in the sky coming rapidly toward them. They ran, but a strap broke on one of Cecilio's sandals. He had to stop, and the women ran on without him. As he tried to fix the sandal, the object came down and hovered just above his head, lighting up everything around him. He was momentarily levitated off the ground before the UFO went away. Cecilio became violently ill and never recovered, dying several weeks later. It is interest- February 2004 MUFON UFO Journal Page 7"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"ing to note that the attacks on Cecilio and Hermelindo were one month apart and within 35(kilometers of each other. An upward pull Many encounters in the valley were nowhere near as dramatic, but were still of high interest. In Mocamb'o, eight kilo- meters northeast of Sao Vicente, a teen- age boy felt an intermittent upward pull from a UFO as it passed over him one night. In 1983 near the village of Patrimonio, eight kilometers northwest of Sao Vicente, a UFO levitated a young farmer about half a meter off the ground and car- ried him about ten meters before his wife could pull him back down. Sightings at the farm At the farm, Vera has had three sightings over the years. The first was in 1990, when the family's new house was being built. It is located four to five hun- dred meters north of the old house where Vera and her husband Arthur, known by the nickname of Souto, raised their seven children. The new house was almost completed, but Vera and Souto still spent much of their time at the old house. It was a Sun- day night, and she and Souto had fallen asleep at the old house while watching TV. They woke up when they heard dogs barking, and decided to go to the new house to sleep there, Vera said. \"We were walking, and all of a sudden Souto said, 'Look at the light!' There was a light above the silo next to the barns. Souto said he had seen it from the begin- ning, but it was going on and off. It was a yellow light, very beautiful. It didn't hurt your eyes.\" At that time they were standing be- side a gate about 100 meters from the barns. \"Then Souto said there was an- other light above the corn crib that didn't go off. It was a red one and looked like a glowing coal. We were watching and Souto said, 'Notice how silent everything is.' We couldn't hear any birds or ani- mals or anything making noise. \"The two dogs seemed paralyzed, looking at the light. I could hear a faint sizzling or frying sound, a very low sound, but Souto said he couldn't hear anything. The light kept pulsing, from very small like a star and then zooming very large.\" Souto wanted to get closer, but Vera was afraid, and a few minutes later they arrived at the new house. \"I opened a window in the kitchen and watched the light for half an hour,\" she said. \"It was still pulsing all that time.\" She went to bed without knowing when the light disappeared. \"The next PageS morning I went to the silo and looked all around, but everything was OK, no burns or anything else.\" That evening, however, she, Souto, and a maid left the house in a car to drive to Belo Horizonte. \"When we got to the place where we had watched the light the night before, something very strange happened. All of a sudden from the di- rection of the silo came an astonishingly fluorescent green light that flew rapidly in a diagonal direction right over the car and disappeared in front of us. It turned off quickly. \"My husband was astonished. He stopped the car, got out and searched for the light, but he didn't find anything. That time he became nervous!\" Barking dogs \"I have eight dogs at my farm,\" Vera said. \"Six sleep in the kennel all night, and two of them, a boxer and a basset hound, run free. On the night of Sept. 13, 2002, about 9:30, all the dogs started bark- ing very much. \"All of a sudden the boxer went through the bushes and started to sniff everything,, and then ran into the dark- ness of our big garden. The basset hound followed, and soon both of them started to sniff, then immediately stopped to bark and snarl. \"I had been watching TV, and at 11 o'clock I went to my room to sleep. The two windows were open, and I started to close one. It was almost closed when I saw a light next to our orchard. I opened the window quickly to watch it. \"It was hovering over a tree just be- yond the fence. It was like a fireball twink- ling all colors, red, yellow and white. All of a sudden the ball opened like a yellow flower, very beautiful. It was similar to a yellow poppy with a black center, and then the thing disappeared. It was there one minute and then it wasn't! The dogs kept barking all the time.\" UFO returns to Fazenda Cynthia, Tom, and I spent a week at Vera's farm in mid-May, going with Vera to Sao Vicente and nearby farms almost every day. Shortly after we went back to MUFON UFO Journal our own homes, the former mayor told local investigators Jose Cimalia and Ivan Soares that had he known we were there, he could have taken us to meet a man who had a sight- ing just three days before we first arrived. That would have been around May 10. Further proof that the phe- nomenon is still around came a month later, on the evening of June 9, and again at Fazenda dos Po96es. \"My husband Souto was driv- ing back to the farm with my son-in-law Leonardo,\" Vera said later. \"About 8 o'clock in the evening, just as they were driving through the gate at the entrance to the farm, they saw a bright light in the distance ahead of them. It was on the other side of the (Das Velhas) river, beyond the house. \"Souto rushed into the house shout- ing, 'Vera, the light is there on the other side of the river!' We ran to the veranda, and it was there, beautiful with golden yellow sparkling rays like I saw from my window the night of Sept. 13 last year. But this time it was bigger than the one I saw before. It changed shape inside its aura. Sometimes it was shaped like a pyra- mid with two balls of light below and one ball on top. \"Then it seemed like that 'flower' shape (in the 2002 sighting), but very much bigger. My husband is an engineer accustomed to calculations, and I asked him how big he thought it was from that distance. He said 15 centimeters.\" About 8:30 they went in to eat dinner, and about 9 Vera looked for the light again. It was gone. \"I felt sad. I sat down to watch TV, but I was so excited that from time to time I jumped up to look again. And at 9:30 it was there again.\" It was still there when she went to bed. She slept fitfully, waking up from time to time to look, and each time it was still there. But when she looked again at 4:30 in the morning, it was gone. Much of the Valley of the Old Women remains unexplored by ufologists. Who knows what other sightings and encoun- ters have occurred in this region?

Lang MS, CHt Editor's Note: Readers, authors, re- searchers, and experience™ range from strictly \"nuts and bolts\" ufologists to those who are willing to \"push the enve- lope.\" Not so many years ago abductions were too \"far out\" for mainstream ufology, but today we are confronted with the question of what to make of those ab- ductions. Mr. Lang discusses one possi- bility. Introduction and observations I n the past few years, as I have worked with greater numbers of close encounter experiencers, I have informally noticed a pattern in their family lines. David Jacobs in The Threat, 1 and Budd Hopkins in Intruders 2 both clearly state that the UFO abduction phenom- enon is multi-generational in nature. Jacobs further says that in each family of UFO encounter experiencers, the entire next generation of offspring may also be experiencers. However, in my work with close en- counter experiencers, what seems to have emerged is that the multigenerational characteristics of the phenomenon seem to propagate down the maternal family line. I have informally noticed the propa- gation of the phenomenon from grand- mother to mother to daughter and so on. Another thing that I have noticed is that many experiencers-and, especially in this generation, the children of experiencers-seem to have a very gifted, and highly metaphysical nature-what I describe as \"Awakened.\" Are these children some of those who are so often called \"The Indigo Children?\" Is the Indigo phenomenon at least partly associated (deliberately or otherwise) with the close encounter phenomenon? Let's look at some of the characteris- tics of indigo children, compare them with the characteristics of experiencers, and note whether there are resemblances.. If there is a pattern, is this perhaps a sign of \"The Awakening\" 3 , which has been suggested might be a goal of the Visitor phenomenon? Alternatively, are these children sim- ply reflecting the ideas and mind-sets of their parents/families? About the author Craig R.

The \"Awakening\" literature In the section on the Indigo children on her website, www.metagifted.org, 4 au- thor Wendy Chapman describes the char- acteristics of the Indigo child as deeply empathic, visionary, intuitive, having a deep sense of mission/purpose, and a very thin veil between the physical and spiritual worlds. In addition, she describes them as be- ing intellectually gifted, resistant to au- thority, and having difficulties with the mundane, non-creative aspects of life- such as much of the education system. Many of these same characteristics can also be ascribed to those adults who are undergoing, or have undergone, an Awakening-cither as a result of the CE4 phenomenon or some other source. In their book Healing Shattered Re- ality 5 Alice Bryant and Linda Seebach discuss the spiritual/mental/physical ef- fects of the Encounter Phenomenon on the experiencer. In \"The Awakening,\" a previous ar- ticle for the Journal, I discussed many of the signs of spiritual awakening, and re- lated them to the UFO/CE4 phenomenon. I asked whether the relationship is one of cause/effect, or are they parallel phenom- ena, perhaps with a synchronistic rela- tionship between them? Barbara Harris Whitfield in her book Spiritual Awakenings 6 describes the many signs and characteristics associated with such awakenings. She describes many possible triggers for such an expe- rience: near-death-experiences, deep meditation and religious experiences, UFO/CE4 encounters, and personal health crises, as well many possible oth- ers. All of these seem to suggest that the Awakening phenomenon is triggered by powerful changes in a person's life. Yet all of these changes seem to be spiritually-related. In some way, a person seems to \"bring something back\" from the experience that appears to be an ex- traordinary gift from \"out there.\" For the newly Awakened, the signs of the phenomenon seem to include; (1) a sudden shift in perspective to a more spiritual/metaphysical viewpoint; (2) shifts in spiritual/religious views, beyond any one religion, to encompass all religions and all people; and (3) less patience with the more petty aspects of human society in the face of the environmental and spiritual issues that our society faces. But foremost for our purposes is the onset of psychic abilities and increased intuition. This seems to be the key, as it affords the newly Awakened an avenue for increased awareness and shift in per- spective. As more than one experiencer has said, \"It was as if my eyes were suddenly opened.\" As they have described to me, the Awakened seem to have more UFO sightings and experiences, either as a cause, effect, or synchronistic relation- ship with their other Awakening experi- ences. Experiencers & Indigo children What we also seem to notice as we look at the families of experiencers is that the characteristics emerging in newly Awakened adults seem to be already present in their children. As indicated earlier, many close en- counter experiencers describe their chil- dren as Indigos. As an informal observa- tion, I have noted a disproportionately large number of such children among these families. It is as if these children were born Awakened. A friend of mine, who is an educator and frequently teaches classes for gifted children, has observed that in her gifted classes there is a very large population of children who match the psychic, deeply-empathic, and deeply-intuitive description of the Indigo child. In other classes she teaches, which are not at the gifted-children level, she February 2004 MUFON UFO Journal Page 9"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"notes that there are far fewer children who match this description. She also notes that many of the gifted children seem to bear physical characteristics of experiencers, specifically scoop marks (she has observed this on their faces and foreheads, though it has been noted that for experiencers such marks are more typically on ankles, etc.). This suggests that, as the children of experiencer families, they continue the fam- ily-line relationship with the Visitor phe- nomenon. So might there be a correlation between the Visitor experience and the Indigo child phenomenon? Could there be a \"genetic agenda\" to the Visitor phenomenon which might result in an increased number of Awakened children? We can understand more about the pre- sumed genetic agenda behind the phenom- enon in several recent books by close en- counter researchers. In his Watchers 1 book series, Raymond Fowler describes how the UFO abduction phenomenon seems to be guiding humanity throughout history, per- haps signifying such an agenda. In Sight Unseen by Budd Hopkins and Carol Rainey, 8 the authors discuss the po- tential feasibility of transgenics, or gene transplantation from one species to an- other. They describe possible instances of apparently-human beings who exhibit strange alien-like characteristics. Similarly, in my article \"Close Encoun- ters of the Third Kind in Our Everyday World\" 9 1 describe similar cases of appar- ently human beings with extraordinary characteristics. Among them are traits such as deep empathy, powerful intuition, and psychic ability. These are also characteris- tics described in the Indigo children. In addition, the abduction accounts of many experiencers contain procedures done to them which seem to have funda- mentally altered their very makeup-as one described it, \"right down to the cellular level.\" Could this be seen as a tampering with the very genetic makeup of the experiencer? Could this perhaps be a back- insertion of the results of the hybridiza- tion process into the genetic makeup or other fundamental characteristics of the experiencer? Does such technology yet exist to accomplish this? The motivation What would be the motivation for such tampering with the human genetic makeup? What would an Extraterrestrial strategy 10 ' 1 ' be towards humanity? And why would external Visitors want to change humanity in such a fundamental way? A quick look at the modem history of humanity provides some immediate clues: 1. Humanity is now on the verge of de- veloping interstellar flight. 12 Advances in zero point theory, 13 the understand- ing of gravity, and other areas of phys- ics 14 suggest that within 100 to 200 years, • humans might well be out among the stars. 2. Humanity has developed the ca- pability for destruction on a planetary scale. We have developed multi-mega- ton nuclear weapons, which we could potentially 15 unleash in a global barrage, resulting in multi-gigatons of explosive power unleashed into the planetary en- vironment. Thus, we have the capabil- ity of destroying the entire ecosystem and civilization of our world-or possi- bly some other world. 3. In many ways, humanity is a fun- damentally warlike being. Our largest single industry is war. 16 During modern times, our history has been dominated by such cataclysms as World War I, World War II, and uncountable geno- cidal massacres. 17 Thus, from the perspective of those presumed to be already existing \"out there\" in the cosmic neighborhood, we can ask, \"Are these the types of folks we would want coming out into the neighborhood?\" In humanity's current state of con- sciousness and behavior, I suggest that the answer is \"No,\" even though we may indeed be on the verge of star-flight. If we are going \"there,\" then it becomes vital to the neighbors that we somehow be changed (tamed) in order to avoid universal catastrophe. Requisite Visitor technology What remains to be established in our formulation of this hypothesis is the technology via which genetic back-in- jection might take place. Yet even here, known technology may be just over the horizon. While humanity has not yet per- fected the means to inject a new gene pattern into the overall cellular makeup of a higher-living being, gene therapy 18 is an active area of research, and could soon become a viable technology. Fur- thermore, not every cell of the body would need to be modified-only the eggs or sperm of the parents. Since it has been established that these can be extracted via human tech- nology, we can easily imagine technol- ogy for re-insertion. Thus, for the Visi- tors, back-insertion of modified genes might be quite feasible. CE4 researchers may wish to exam- ine UFO abduction accounts to see if indeed, such procedures and technol- ogy are described. This then, is what I call the \"Indigo Hypothesis\": that the genetic changes fostered by the Visitors may actually be- gin to be found in the general populace, in the new generation of humanity. We theorize a back-injection of hybridization changes by the Visitors into experiencers for the purpose of integrating them into humanity as a whole. A result is the emerging Indigo gen- eration we see today. The Indigo genera- tion would thus be a manifestation of an effort by \"them\" to breed into our spe- cies an awakened being. We can suggest that as these children take their functional place in society, we might see a more \"awakened,\" less-envi- ronmentally-impacting, and more-peace- ful conduct of human affairs. In addition, we may begin to see a new humanity, more ready for contact, and a resulting more-open manifestation of \"them\" to the general population of \"us.\" The Null Hypotheses As suggested earlier, perhaps there are other ways of viewing the relationship of Indigo children and experiencer families. 1. Nurture instead of Nature: Perhaps Indigo children are simply learning and adopting the views and mannerisms of their parents, who may have adopted \"new-age\" ideas, and/or have undergone a deep psychic/spiritual change. Perhaps the propagation of \"Awakening\" down the family line is the passing of memes,' 9 rather than genes. 2. No Correlation: Perhaps the In- digo Children reflect a more global social phenomenon, which has no correlation with the UFO/CE4 phenomenon. The In- digo Children might reflect either a fun- damental metaphysical phenomenon which we do not yet understand, or a propagation of ideas as described in null hypothesis 1. Testing the Indigo Hypotheses The purpose of a hypothesis is to serve as a tentative model from which we can derive testable predictions. So what would be a good test of \"The Indigo Hy- pothesis\"? Here are some preliminary suggestions: Genetics: Might the genome of Indigo children show common markers, not present in non-Indigos? If so, what char- acteristics would these genes code for? If we didn't detect common but unique genetic markers among Indigo children, would this support one of the null hy- potheses? Genealogy: Does comparison of the Page 10 MUFON UFO Journal February 2004"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"family lines of Indigo children with those of experiencers show a correlation? Are Indigo children more often found in the family lines of close' encounter experiencers? If so, what does this im- ply? If no strong correlation is found, then would null hypothesis 2 be supported? Psychic Abilities: Do Indigo children have greater psychic abilities? Perhaps this can be tested via experiments such as those at the PEAR lab at Princeton University, 20 which has been developing scientific tests of ESP and non-local con- sciousness. Effects on World Affairs: Observing cultural, scientific and political events over the next ten-plus years, as the cur- rent generation of Indigo children be- comes active in society. As this generation reaches a political- social critical mass, what effect does this have on the politics of our civilization? Is there a trend away from war and environ- mental destruction? Is there an incorpo- ration of intuition and spirituality into mainstream society and politics? Open Contact: As the above changes take place, is there an increase in open, multi-witness UFO and CE3 events over the next few years? All of these tests, and others which I have not yet thought of, might better es- tablish the validity or non-validityof this hypothesis. Conclusion If this hypothesis is true, then it im- plies that the Visitors want us to grow and eventually join the cosmic commu- nity. To me this offers hope: that human- ity can become an awakened cosmic/star- faring civilization-and that there is a cheering section out there for us. At least in part, this is the core of the idea which I call \"The Indigo Hypothesis.\" References: 'David Jacobs, The Threat, discusses the \"dark side\" aspects of a possible alien agenda. 2 Budd Hopkins, Intruders, discusses multi-generational trends and a possible ge- netic agenda. 3 \"The Awakening,\" by Craig R.

Georgia woman reports object at treetop level By Tom Sheets MUFON Georgia Director The witness is a 57-year-old female resident of Duluth, GA, employed by an internationally famous Atlanta area uni- versity. She is from a \"scientific\" family, her father being involved in atomic re- search during the WWII era. On 7 Jan 04 at about 7:30 PM, the wit- ness was driving through her neighbor- hood, and as she prepared to turn onto her street she noticed overhead a set of bright lights beginning to glide past. Upon looking closer she noticed that the lights were attached to the bottom of a large dark triangular object (WUFOD \"actual size\" data field entry indicating 100-300 feet). She continued watching, then turned onto her street, keeping the object in sight. The witness stated that her first impres- sion was that the object was a \"stealth type\" craft. She described it as being very low in altitude (treetop), with no sound noticed (vehicle windows rolled up). She indicated that it was low enough that she had no trouble observing a suc- tion cup-like configuration around the steady white lights, one in the middle and also one on each ot the three corners, totaling four. At that point, it was travel- ing parallel to her and a little bit ahead. She sped up, but it appeared to be going a bit faster than her vehicle. The craft then began to ascend, banking slightly to the left, and departed the scene. Simultaneous to the above, the wit- ness was attempting to get out her cell phone in order to summon her friend to run outside and look skyward, but the phone was dropped onto the floorboard. She noticed two neighbors outside at the end of the street and intends to speak with them as soon as possible. Within a few minutes, the witness ar- rived home and called the local police, Atlanta's Channel 11 (NBC), and Atlanta's Fernbank Science Center, but no object had been reported. As with all such preliminary reports, this case requires additional scrutiny, in- cluding an in-depth interview with the witness', as well as other detailed investi- gation. Thid witness has agreed to an in- terview with our investigators, and the case is being assigned to SSD/FI David Brown of Norcross.

Following is the account from one of the women, a commercial artist: \"It was late August, around 5-6 PM. The weather was clear, sunny; I do not recall many clouds. A group of five, in- cluding myself, sighted a red saucer type craft with a dome while driving down what is referred to as the mountain in the area. \"One of the occupants of the vehicle initially sighted the craft to the right of us enroute to the bay/harbour area of Hamilton and proceeded to alert us to the phenomenon by commenting in an excited manner along the lines of 'Oh my god, look at that... look at that... over there!!!' (I remember a lot of Oh my gods, etc. \"Clear as day, the five us saw a bright red saucer craft with a dome and yellow lights radiating from the base/bottom part of the craft. \"The radio in the vehicle became static, and I recall the driver turning the radio off due to the excitement of the sighting and not wanting to have any further dis- tractions while driving. \"There were many comments regard- ing where it was going, and then some- one had mentioned, 'Follow that UFO!' All were in agreement. From the position we were at, at the onset of the sighting while driving down the mountain, our view of the downtown area and the bay/ harbour was not obstructed in any way. \"A rough estimate as to the size of the craft length wise would compare to ap- proximately 3-4 medium car sizes, perhaps even larger. \"As far as how fast it was going, I can't properly gauge-slow enough to keep track of it while driving down the moun- tain. How high up I also cannot properly gauge the distance. The craft's move- ments and location in the sky could be compared to a plane coming in for a land- ing. \"The craft was sighted to the right of us, moving in and towards our direction, and then crossed our path moving left, just ahead of us, and then proceeded to- or it appeared to-slow down just above the bay/harbour, and then appeared to just level itself down into the water ever so gently and totally submerge. \"The yellow lights of the craft ap- peared to settle into more of a pale yellow to white lights, and then seem to dull out. At this point we were still on the moun- tain drive, and the distance of the craft was further away. I do not recall seeing any major disturbance of the water. \"There were more excited comments along the lines of'Oh my god-it just went into the water...' etc. All of us were wide-eyed and I think in a form of shock. Other comments were about driving down to the waterfront, and while doing so whether we would miss anything going on down there. \"The driver of the car sped up in order to get down to the area quicker, just in case. We arrived at the waterfront-I be- lieve it may have been a park area. The road leading into where we decided to park was a gravel/dirt road, and I remem- ber a lot of grass/wildflower overgrowth growing in and around the road. We had forested areas on either side of the road area. \"We had managed to find the right spot, and if the UFO was still parked in that water then we would have had a di- rect view right in front of us-although us on land and the UFO in the water. \"When we had arrived at the water- front and exited the vehicle we noticed slight wave motion in the water. Some comments as to whether this may have been related. We stayed in this area for hours. Many a conversation ensued re- garding what we had witnessed-from government experimental craft to aliens. \"Conversations and questions, such as how deep is the bay?, radar, and whether anyone else had spotted it and would call it in. Wondering when the in- flux of planes/helicopters would appear. Wondering whether the craft would emerge. Wondering if we were taking a risk by being there, and later on wonder- ing why no police or anything else along those lines were not at the waterfront questioning us, etc, etc, etc. \"All was quiet. No planes, no helicop- ters, nothing. Nothing until about 12:30-1:00 in the morning. At this time is when what appeared to be submarines emerged, or part of what could have been, and what looked like suspicious subma- rines. \"One was on one end of the water body, and another across from it. If the craft (UFO) was still parked where it went down, then it would have been sand- wiched between the subs. \"Of course more conversation and ex- citement regarding this element. Was this a part of the craft, or were these objects in actual fact subs? One of the objects looked like a periscope type thing, and the other object looked like a box on top of a bigger box. We had one set of bin- oculars and took turns looking out for whatever during the whole time we were there. \"We did not need the use of the bin- oculars to spot and have a view of the periscope looking thing and the other box that emerged from the water. These ob- jects stayed there unmoving all the while we were there, and who knows how long they were parked there after we left. \"We left about an hour or so later at about 2 AM or so, and the objects were still there at that time. We finally left tired and hungry, feeling somewhat disap- pointed that nothing else exciting hap- pened, but also rather relieved.\" The witness said the object was \"not a small craft,\" and indeed it wasn't.

This would put the UFO in the area of 46' 9\" to 62' 4\" in diameter and 13' 6\" in height. Slightly smaller than the B-25 Mitchell bomber of WWII. At the point of the object's entry into the water (rough approximation) it can be seen on a nautical chart that the water depth is 7 or more meters (23 feet), and gets deeper in the direction of Lake Ontario, so the UFO had at least 10 feet to spare. Therefore a craft of 13 feet in height could be covered by water. There are many cases of UFOs submerging in shallow waters. The question of these two objects be- ing submarines came up, and the Cana- dian Navy states that it does not use the few subs they have in the Great Lakes. Another possibility regarding the emerging objects might be the tide going out and revealing some fixed underwater object. This portion of the sighting is the most speculative and should not detract from the sighting of the craft. It has been almost 22 years since the sighting. It would have been advanta- geous if we had the testimony of at least one other witness, but as this witness states, \"I haven't been in contact with the four other witnesses for over 20 years. They were work related acquaintances, and I cannot even remember their names.\" Since the exact date cannot be deter- mined, it is impossible to get weather data for the sighting. This of course would have clarified whether the object was something being blown by the wind. However, even if the wind had a vec- tor in the direction the UFO took, the pos- sibility of it being a balloon or light ob- ject is still ruled out by the fact that it immediately entered the water, whereas a balloon or light object would have floated for a period. And a balloon with lights?? Conclusion This report was entirely done through e-mails and snail mail between the wit- ness and myself. This format is not very desirable, as there is no immediate inter- change of ideas, emotions, and measure- ments such as angles and distances. However, the witness now resides far from Hamilton, making an on-site investi- gation economically impractical. The case, as old as it is, is still interesting and, I think, illustrates how an event of this kind can etch itself into the memory banks of our minds, as she remembers the sight- ing fairly well, but could not remember the events prior or after the sighting. The witness was very cooperative and quick to answer all the messages sent to the best of her ability. Where the facts were fuzzy, she stated that, and yet the item of focus, the UFO, was clearly re- membered. Based on my experience with water-related cases, her surprise at the ease of entry into the water could be ex- pected, but there are many cases of just such an entry. I believe that she had wit- nessed a UFO event. c'iLL. H*' jiy; \"\"~~ View of downtown Hamilton -ReosGope j Sub type thing '>*v - • I #1 Emerged I First ; #2 Emerged \\ within 1/2 hrs. time  !

Connecticut triangle GUILFORD - On Jan. 6,2004, at about 8:40 PM, the witness was told to look outside by her little sister who was ob- serving something in the air. She went to the door and saw something rising straight up in the shape of a flying tri- angle with an estimated 400 lights. The witness states, \"After a few minutes, it stopped, and the blinking lights were not vis- ible, and it flew right out of sight. \"My dogs were freaking out the whole time the UFO was near. The UFO rose straight up in the air, nose up, then stopped, straightened so the nose was pointing at us, and then flew away.\" Peter Davenport, director of the Na- tional UFO Reporting Center (NUFORC), spoke with this witness, and she sounded quite sincere and credible. Vermont light formations WATERFORD - This event was wit- nessed by three people who agree on the details. They were walking up the hill to their house from their barn at 7:10 PM on Dec. 10,2003, when they noticed a flash of light fill the sky behind them. One witness stated, \"When I whirled around, I was startled by the appearance of six bright, white lights in two appar- ently separate triangular groups. Each triangular group of three lights appeared to be the size of a folded postcard held at arm's length. \"The lights were maybe 250 yards away, moving toward me at high speed, descending from an initial altitude of a couple of hundred feet. There were only the six bright lights, quite small in size, with no structure discernible around them or between them.\" The lights were not flashing, and were a constant white color, although one wit- ness felt they had some pink tinges. The two triangular groups moved together for 10 to 15 seconds with no change in the spacing between them other than an ap- parent increase in size as the object(s) ap- proached. The witness continues, \"There was no sound. At the same moment, I noticed two military aircraft flying one in front of the other well behind the lights and at a higher altitude with navigation lights and strobes. \"We border military area Y-2 in New Hampshire. The triangular lights were near the ground and moving northeast in an entirely different direction than the planes. After 10-15 seconds all six lights disap- peared at exactly the same moment. They simply vanished at once while in motion towards me, as though someone turned off a light switch. \"The two chase aircraft made a wide, sweeping turn around our property, and in a minute another two aircraft joined the pattern, circling our property. The planes remained circling overhead in a fairly tight turning pattern for one hour and twenty minutes.\" Thanks to Peter Davenport, UFOcenter. Northern Ireland triangle CLOGHER, COUNTY TYRONE - On Thursday, Dec. 11,. 2003, Milton Clarke was outdoors in his hometown when a UFO approached from the north. \"It seemed like a glowing triangle, a really bright glow,\" Milton reported. \"I couldn't see any markings. It was very close to the ground at one point, only 20 meters (66 feet) off the ground. \"It came in very fast, slowed down to a stop, then flew away very fast towards the west. I took some pictures,.but it's hard to know if they will come out.

It was moving slowly across the sky, and hovered above the field. The witness says, \"It was maybe 100-300 feet off of the ground, and I could see it clearly. It was dark in color. The lights were yel- low, and there was no noise. \"It looked to be about the size of a small airplane and was moving south, then it turned northeast at a fast rate of speed. It then turned back south, then traveled really fast and disappeared. The lights were in a triangular shape, one light on each comer of the object. \"The sighting lasted about 20 minutes, and I never encountered anything weird and scary like this before,\" he said.

MYERS - An object appeared al- most the size of the full moon as it flew over on Jan. 4,2004, at 2:30 PM, accord- ing to the witnesses, who had a very clear and \"razor sharp view\" of a very thin disc. The \"bottom\" surface appeared shaded, and the upper surface was highly reflective and showed a wide low bulge nearly filling the diameter. It was definitely a disc, said the wit- nesses, and definitely nearly flat on its \"upper\" and \"lower\" surfaces. It behaved like a balloon-drifting and turning, climb- ing and dipping, bobbing weightlessly, in a more or less easterly direction. It did not appear to be under \"con- trol\" or \"doing\" anything. It was big and definitely \"hardware,\" and not a cloud. Nearby airfields are Paige Field and SW Florida International Airport. This occurred in or near the landing path for some of the air traffic. The disk had a bulge on one face, was 30 feet across, reflected sunlight, and bobbed around at 3-5000 feet. Thanks to Peter Davenport, UFOcenter. Missouri - Alien Or Monster CHAFFEE - The witness was driving about 55 mph when he saw a dull alumi- num bent up \"clothes hanger like\" crea- ture on Dec. 9,2003, at 12:50 and slowed to.40rhph. He states, \"The creature looked like a big aluminum colored cockroach man with very long legs, and he looked like he was running on his knees. It was seven feet tall, but we saw no face or eyes, and it Page 14 MUFON UFO Journal February 2004"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"was hunched over as it ran. At first, it looked like a deer, until it ran by the truck so fast that you really couldn't see its legs moving...it .was more like scurrying. \"It looked like it had some sort of arms, and I didn't really see wings...but it was moving as if it had wings. It moved faster and ran further than anything living that I have ever seen. \"It was similar to a pumpkin head, or like an imp, but only taller. I said to my friend, 'Did you see that we almost hit a deer?' He said, 'Yes.' Then something zoomed ten feet by the passenger side door up to thirty feet in front of the truck. \"I sped up to about 65 mph and passed the creature, and looked over my shoul- der to the back of my truck. It was behind us and was running fast, then caught up and was running along side of us for a good four seconds, then it zoomed past the truck again, to about 20 feet in front of us and jumped straight into the air and disappeared. \"We will never know what it was, but I really don't see myself going back to this spot at night.\" Thanks to Peter Daven- port, UFOcenter.' Indiana police chase object HUNTINGTON - Three police officers who say a strange object drifted through the skies over this northeastern Indiana city are trying to find someone else who saw it. Officer Chip Olinger was warming up his car about 2:30 PM on Dec. 26,2003, when he reported seeing a circular object in the sky and radioed officers Greg Hedrick and Randy Hoover, who also saw it. All three say they watched as the ob- ject moved out of the northwest, drifted toward a church steeple, then shot straight north without a sound in an en- counter that lasted less than a minute. The trio describes the object as about the size of a hot air balloon or a backyard trampoline. They said it was low enough in the sky that Olinger thought it might crash into the steeple. It stopped a few times and spun slowly, changing shapes and at one point turned orange, possibly from reflected sunlight. \"It wasn't any kind of flying machine that I can think of,\" Olinger told The Herald-Press. \"And it's not like a 1950s flying saucer. It was that big, but it didn't have a hump in the middle.\" No one called city, county, or Indiana State Police to report it, and for a few days the three officers didn't say anything about it. Thanks to Huntington News. White oval object in Canada HOUSTON - A man had just trans- ported his wife from a friend's house when they arrived back home at 8:45 PM on Dec. 8,2003. They pulled into their long driveway only to see the two kids stand- ing outside yelling and pointed towards the mountain behind their home. The husband stopped the car quickly and both parents jumped out in fear, as they had no idea what was wrong, think- ing the worst. They noticed a white oval- shaped object sitting stationary over their property with a solid ring of blue lights moving around the white colored object. A slight and annoying hum could be heard. The mother went over and grabbed the two children and went into the house. The father followed, but they watched from inside. The object lit up the frees in a white light for a good distance and after four minutes it slowly started to move, drop- ping white sparks off the bottom. It rose up rather slowly, and as it reached the top of the mountain they lost sight of it. Thanks to Brian Vike, director, CANADA HBCC Research. Cigar shapes in Arizona SELIGMAN - Three friends were driv- ing back from Las Vegas, on Jan. 5,2004, when the driver commented on \"the re- ally bright stars\" that had appeared about 45 minutes before sunset. The objects seemed to be moving. Within minutes, they saw a bright light change to a cigar shape that turned red very suddenly. It appeared to explode, and the witnesses watched intently as the first object began to fall, while the second white object turned a bright red and hovered over the mountain range ad- jacent to Interstate 40 southbound. The object started to do several other bizarre things, such as breaking out into a lateral acceleration that seemed to have covered 50 miles within seconds, stop, turn colors, lift into the sky and return to its low altitude, go in reverse immediately with rapid speed, and then rocket off again. After reaching the near-end of the mountain range, the view improved and the object joined five or six more just like it, but each one was a varying intensity of red light. All of these objects demon- strated their agility and handling, just as the first. One by one, the objects were either disappearing behind trees or hills or van- ishing into thin air. The witnesses saw several other objects that were clearly air- planes and helicopters during the rest of their drive that evening, but nothing like the red lights on the mountains. Peter Davenport spoke with this wit- ness, and he sounded sincere, and quite credible. UFOcenter. Delta shape in Ireland DUBLIN - The witness was on his way to college in a bus at 7:45 AM on Dec. 15, 2003, and looked out the window and saw a bright blue rectangle light high up in the sky. He is certain it was not a star nor a conventional aircraft. The light faded, and this object started flying from where the light had been and flew quite fast to 20 degrees east. The ob- server states, \"I was in disbelief and lost sight of it as the bus moved. The UFO was dark and delta shaped, and had a light on three corners, and one was blinking. \"Ten minutes later a rectangle of light was seen where I had seen it the first time. I noticed it was moving, but as the bus moved we were not gaining any ground on it, then the light faded in a flash. This was undeniably not a plane since it was flying at about 2000 feet, way too low for a commercial aircraft in an urban area.\" Thanks to Peter Davenport, UFOcenter. Arrowhead objects in England BURNHAM-ON-CROUCH - On Dec. 13, 2003, at 8:30 PM the witness was in his garden when he looked up to see two objects heading north, shaped like curved edge arrowheads, flying straight. The witness reports, \"They were per- forming maneuvers and crossing each other's path in an almost DNA-like spiral. They were illuminated by a dull light un- derneath, with a soft-fuzzy and pale yel- low light, and were about the size of planes, but I'm convinced they were not planes. \"There was no noise from them, and they were flying low at about 250 feet. I watched them until they flew out of sight over my house.\" Thanks to Peter Daven- port, UFOcenter. Triangle in Norway OSLO - On Dec. 15,2003, at 7:45 PM the observer was looking out of his win- dow when he saw three white lights which formed a triangular shape hovering just over a hill about one mile away.

It was about 80 meters (264 feet) above ground, lowering to about 20 meters (66 feet).

California egg-shaped objects HAYWARD - The witnesses were driving southbound on Mission Boule- vard on Jan. 4,2004, at 10:40 PM, and saw an object in the sky about 100 feet above the street. The object was white and egg- shaped, and light reflected off it, but it was not a flashy or metallic reflection. The witness reports, \"It was about five feet in diameter at its thinnest point and moved north just over us as we drove southbound. Then, I saw two more ob- jects, about 3/4 that size. I decided to pull over to look and grab my camera. \"They were also egg-shaped, but gray, non-metallic. The white egg shape then changed shape slightly into a smooth- ened diamond-like shape about 200 feet above me. The two gray craft stopped in mid-air, and the white craft joined them briefly in a delta formation over our heads. \"The white craft then again sped off towards the north, and the two gray craft quickly went straight up and disappeared. The white craft followed us south as we drove off and then sped off. I took sev- eral pictures.\" Thanks to Peter Davenport, UFOcenter. Canada shuttle-shaped triangle WEST DUBLIN, N.S. - The object was heading northwest, up the LaHave River toward Bridgewater, on Dec. 17,2003, at 11:30 AM. As witnessed by two 40-year- old males, it was described as shuttle shaped, but flying upside down with something, perhaps a rudder, pointing downward. The object was triangular shaped and reflecting sunlight. It was observed for ten minutes, moving quite slowly and across the easterly wind at an estimated height of 7,500 feet as it crossed over the witnesses. It was the size of a \"dime at arm's length. No sound. Thanks to Sheldon MacLeod, CKBW, Bridgewater. Netherlands flying triangle ALMELO, Overijssel - A 47-year-old witness was walking a dog outside on Sunday, Jan. 11, 2004, around 8:15 PM, Page 16 when he saw a huge massive triangle- shaped object. At the moment of the sighting the sky was very clear and the stars were very clearly visible. The huge triangle had red lights on each of the three corners. The witness states, \"In the middle of the object there were five lights in a small triangle, there were three indigo blue-colored lights in the middle, and two red lights on each side. The wind blew suddenly very hard from another direction, possibly caused by the craft. There were no engine sounds. The craft moved slowly from the east to the west with two bright white sphere lights on top: The object was very big, much bigger than a jet, and was 250 meters distant and at a height of also 250 meters. It was moving slowly at a con- stant speed of 30 km/h as it passed over- head.\" When the object had passed the wit- ness, he noticed that above the object it had a hilly shape, and on top of that two sphere-shaped bright lights. The sight- ing caused some psychological side ef- fects: \"I came home nervously and stayed in that condition for a couple of hours. I had a strange, restless feeling. During the sighting I was for a moment frightened, a kind of panic almost.\" He also reported the sighting to the Air Force Base Twente, but they said they don't do anything with the report. However, even though it was Sunday, a half hour later he could hear fighter jets fly over!

Mark, 23, and his wife Elizabeth stopped the-car and got out for a better look. At first the objects were hovering in the shape of the Southern Cross. After maneuvering backwards and forwards for a while they formed a line, one after the other. During this time they flashed a little and moved off into the distance. One faded out and then they all faded. This is interesting because Adelaide does have a curfew on take-offs and land- ings (11 PM). Conclusion: Garbage bags or balloons cannot go back and forth!

MUFON UFO Journal Florida triangle over highway MARATHON (FIESTA KEY) - The witnesses were driving toward Key West from Miami on US 1 at about 12:30 AM Jan. 4, 2003, and as they drove over a bridge they saw something with a green and red light. The witness reports, \"I no- ticed it and told my friend I thought it was the balloon that transmits Radio Marti to Cuba. (Many people may not know that the US government has a large balloon located at Cudjoe Key, FL, that transmits Radio Marti to Cuba, but they were too far away to see this balloon.) \"When we got closer to the lights, the driver lost them, but the passenger saw a red and white light 100 to 250 feet hover- ing directly over the highway. \"He also saw a black mass between the lights in what looked like a triangle, but didn't totally point at the top. From his account the white light was on the top, and he saw a red light on the corner of one of the bottom of the points! \"There was never any sound made. We opened the windows of the truck when we were close to it, and it was just quiet. I had to go about 1000 feet to turn around. When we went back, there was nothing there.\" Thanks to UFOcenter. A correction An article in Filers Files in the Jan 2004 MUFON UFO Journal is labeled \"Loui- siana object blocks sky.\" However, the references to Arlington, Cedar Hill, and Highway 287 appear to match an area in the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex better than any place in Louisiana. The previous article, \"Scary sight in Louisiana,\" refers to Abbeville, a town of about 11,000 inhabitants in south central Louisiana. The sighting dates are the same, Nov 19,2003, but no time is listed for the Arlington event. The Abbeville sighting happened at 2:30 pm. Since the descriptions of the objects are similar, by knowing the time of the Arlington sighting, we might esti- mate the speed of the objects (if they are indeed the same). Also, we might find other observers along a line connecting the two observations. It is interesting that a line connecting Arlington, TX, to Abbeville, LA, passes very near Nacodoches, TX, a city that made national news when the space shuttle Columbia disintegrated and dropped hundreds of pieces .in and around Nacodoches. -Les P.

The authors explain that \"Earth is but a fairly new child in comparison to other systems spinning out their lives ,in this vast universe. But our spirit is even much older than the eldest planet. Therefore, we can only conclude that this child-planet Earth is not the only place our spirit has taken on a physical form.

As the beings have told us often, We know you by your light.\" In what has become almost a routine warning by extraterrestrials, the authors are told, \".. .within the last few decades the situation on your planet has almost reached a point of no return. It is desper- ate.\" This situation \"might affect the whole neighborhood. God, the Source, loves all creation unconditionally. But...after a child is reprimanded so many times and still does not listen, the child may need a good spanking.\" What \"a good spanking\" of the Earth might entail is not explained.

Hubble telescope mission to end NASA has decided to stop servicing the Hubble space telescope due to bud- get problems and safety concerns, effec- tively bringing its mission to an early end, US space officials said. Hubble will remain in orbit as long as it can fulfill its duties, then be brought crashing back into Earth's atmosphere, with re-entry expected in 2011, officials said. John Grunsfeld, chief scientist for the National Aeronautics and Space Admin- istration (NASA), said, \"We will get as much life as we can out of the Hubble telescope.\" A previously-planned mission, sched- uled for mid-2005, was to install a new wide field planetary camera and a super- sensitive ultraviolet spectograph de- signed to observe new hot stars, quasi- stellar objects, and the insterstellar me- dium. But it would have required expensive shuttle safety updates that are not nec- essary for the shuttle's only other job, working on the International Space Sta- tion, Grunsfeld said. \"It was a question of looking at the risk elements involved to support the mis- sion,\" Grunsfeld said. Hubble depends on periodic service calls by spacewalk- ing astronauts who upgrade its equip- ment.  - • -- It was unclear how long the telescope would continue to function without the 2005 supply mission. \"It could die tomor- row, or it could last to 2011,\" Dr Steven Beckwith, director of the Space Telescope Institute at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, MD, said. NASA has no fur- ther trips to the Hubble planned until a final \"close-out mission\" in 2010. The announcement marked the first change to an existing NASA mission since President George W. Bush two days earlier announced new directions for the space program, saying he wants to send manned missions to the moon from 2015, and eventually to Mars and beyond. But the space agency was allocated only an additional billion dollars over five years, in addition to its annual budget of $ 15.4 billion, to work toward that goal. The decision to stop servicing the Hubble devastated scientists, since the telescope has provided a wealth of infor- mation and stunning images of the uni- verse since being dropped off in space in April 1990. NASA plans to put a new- generation orbital observatory, the James Webb Space Telescope, into orbit in 2009.

The February 2004 issue has a cover story about UFOs. The title on the cover is \"WHEN UFOs, ARRIVE\"; the cover subtitle is \"What Will You do? The US Government already has a multimillion Dollar TOP-SECRET Plan Ready to Go.\" A further prom- ise of exciting new revelations is given by the sub- title in the article itself: \"The US and other world gov- ernments already have detailed se- cret plans for first contact.\" These are splendid exam- pies of falsity in Friedman advertising. The story is as silly as their June, 2003, cover story \"OFFICIAL US GOVERNMENT ROSWELL FILES. The Startling Facts Declassified.\" Both articles are by Jim Wilson, who has done others about UFOs. The 2003 piece tried to get rid of Roswell with three basic claims: 1. That Frank Kaufmann, who had been shown to be telling false tales, had been involved from the start in the Roswell claims made by believers (imply- ing that therefore the story had col- lapsed); 2. That the base morning reports for the July 4, 1947, weekend, said nothing about the Roswell incident (implying that that meant it had not happened), and 3. That the USAF had declassified all their Roswell Files. All of these are false or misleading. 1. Kaufmann doesn't show up on the scene until 13 years after I began the in- tense civilian investigation of Roswell with my first conversation with Major Jesse Marcel in 1978, and at least 18 years after my conversation with Lydia Sleppy. 2. The morning reports were not clas- sified, and covered personnel changes, not highly classified events like recovery of a crashed saucer. 3. The Air Force declassified nothing about the Roswell incident. In the new article Wilson provides no evidence whatsoever for a multimillion dollar Top-Secret Plan by the US, and no Page 18 evidence at all for such a plan by any other government. He does mention a totally unofficial gentlemen's agreement by SETI special- ists as to how they (as if they were offi- cial spokesmen for us and governments, which they are not) would respond to the first claims that a signal from ETI had been received. Unspoken, but nevertheless true, is that they assume it would come from a civilization dozens if not hundreds or thousands of light years away. No gov- ernment has signed on to the protocol, quite frankly, because it is totally unre- lated to implications of a visit to Earth by an alien spacecraft, the only scenario that Wilson discusses. He talks about Air Force optical tele- scopes and radars picking up a space- craft between the Earth and the moon. Apparently he is unaware that the SETI community seems totally convinced that interstellar travel is impossible, so, ac- cording to them, such a scenario can never occur! One reason for this foolish attitude is that, not surprisingly, astronomers have essentially no knowledge of advanced flight technology. They also assume there will be only very slow, very long distance radio communication using techniques such as we use-despite our enormous youth compared to the history of the gal- axy. SETI has no status The SETI Community has no status at all with governments of the world. It has nothing to do with national or interna- tional security, nor with the development of technology useful by the military- which is a very large fraction of the bud- gets of governments around the world. The development of systems able to reach Earth from some other solar system clearly indicates a very much higher level of technological sophistication than so far manifested on Earth. The same thing applies with regard to small Earth Excursion Modules able to flit around the earth at very high speed and with great maneuverability. Surely these would make wonderful weapons delivery and defense systems. Wilson, incredibly, seems to believe that the radar and optical tracking sys- tems of the US and other governments have never previously noted such high MUFON UFO Journal performance systems. The data they record is born classified. He might wish to examine (though I doubt it) several ex- cellent radar visual sightings described by Dr. James McDonald in his 71-page Congressional Testimony of July 29,1968 (Available for $10. Postpaid from UFORI, FOB 958 Houlton, ME 04730- 0958). Many other cases Richard Hall included many radar-vi- sual sightings in both the 1965 and more recent versions of his The UFO Evidence. Wilson is apparently unaware of the 5,000 physical trace cases collected by Ted Phillips from 90 countries (16% involving reports of humanoids), and the more than 1,200 sightings by pilots in Dominique Weinstein's outstanding collection-and the many more on file with NARCAP (Na- tional Aviation Reporting Center on Anomalous Phenomena). Wilson even has the gall to say, \"Unique as the appearance of an alien piloted spacecraft may be \" The cover and the article use graphics that might have come straight out of \"The Day the Earth Stood Still,\" complete with the White House in the background and mili- tary vehicles ready to pounce on an in- truding alien saucer sitting on the White House lawn. He goes on to suggest that the three groups who would be involved, in Haz Mat suits no less, would be the FBI, a Department of Energy Nuclear Emer- gency Search Team (NEST), and a De- partment of Agriculture's Animal Disease Center on Plum Island off Long Island. The alien would be poked and probed by NIH doctors rather than, allowed to sleep in the Lincoln Bedroom at the White House! Wilson claims that \"Scientists are of two minds regarding the existence of ex- traterrestrial Intelligence\": skeptics who think Earth is so unique with regard to its magnetic field and the moon, etc, that in- telligence hasn't developed anywhere else, and \"The opposing camp sees the prospect for discovering alien life in more mathematical terms. Its touchstone is the Drake Equation which links the probabil- ity of discovering extraterrestrial intelli- gence to factors such as the size of the universe and the number of stars with earthlike planets. With the discovery of each new planet beyond Earth's Solar February 2004"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"system-there are now more than 100-the odds of encountering intelligent life in- crease.\" These comments obviously ignore those scientists such as myself who. have become convinced by extraordinary evi- dence that aliens have been, and are, vis- iting Earth. Plain and simple nonsense The comment about the Drake Equa- tion is nonsense plain and simple. The Drake Equation purports to tell us how many civilizations there are in the galaxy and has nothing to do with the probabil- ity of discovering ETI. Furthermore dis- covering that there are other planets in the neighborhood tells us nothing about the odds of encountering ETI. We have absolutely zero knowledge of how many planets are inhabited by ETI. We have zero knowledge of whether we will or won't encounter them out there. We have a great deal of evidence indicat- ing that aliens have been coming here for a very long time. Wilson sets up a Proposed Welcom- ing Committee that Popular Mechanics would prefer to see on the job as opposed to one (consisting mainly of astronomers) outlined by the International Academy of Astronautics. They have no binding contract with anybody. PM's American team Popular Mechanic s American team (they have a composite picture of all of them as though they were together) would be chaired by John Glenn (former astronaut and senator), Dr. Frank Drake (science officer), Dr. Hal Puthoff (powerplant engineering), Dr. Sheila Widnall (from MIT and formerly secre- tary of the USAF, and who approved the Roswell Report), Dr. Ning Li (propulsion systems-worked with rapidly rotating su- perconducting magnets seeking a reduc- tion in gravity), Dr. K. Eric Drexler (struc- tural systems-expert on nano-technol- ogy), and Jane Goodall (communications officer-\"primatologist who has proved her ability to communicate with intelligent nonhumans.\" These are all respectable people. I don't see any diplomats or UN Represen- tatives. Apparently Wilson envisions a sau- cer landing on the White House lawn be- ing grabbed by NASA, the vehicle hauled off to labs in New Mexico, and the alien pilot(s) to be poked and prodded. This isn't even good science fiction. Does he really think an alien space- craft would just be wandering by the first time and land in public without having collected a great deal of information about us, our military and detection capabilities, our general approach to each other (hos- tility)? It is almost as if he is assuming that we are more advanced than our visitors instead of the other way around.... even though our technological history is only a few thousand years long and there are stars a billion years older than the sun just down the street. Wilson mentions the unclassified Brookings Institute Study, done for NASA 40+ years ago, and its suggestion that contact between two societies at dif- ferent levels of development is usually to the detriment of the less advanced. But then he says we ignored the Brookings Institute advice by putting a plaque on the Pioneer Spacecraft practi- cally inviting aliens to come. It won't be there soon He mentions it is 7 billion miles (about 10 light hours) from Earth and heading toward Alderberan, as though it would be there soon. That star is 80 light-years away. It seems to me very likely that the USAF and Operation Majestic 12 would have had very highly classified studies done as to the impact of contact. Note that mention is made in the Eisenhower Briefing Document that \"a Contingency plan (MJ-1949-04P/78) should be held in continued readiness should the need to make a public an- nouncement present itself.\" Wilson says, \"Skeptics often ask why UFO sightings seem to take place only in remote locations instead of on busy city streets [a typical stupid skeptical ques- tion based on ignorance of the facts]. Perhaps ET knows what Earthlings have in mind when it lands.\" One would think that an ET spacecraft was just wandering around in the neigh- borhood and would have set down for tea or a beer in the middle of a large city. How long would it take to figure out that the rule here is shoot first and ask ques- tions later? How many times would a UFO have to be chased by an Earthling jet to get the picture? How many nuclear weapons tests would have to be observed to gain un- derstanding of Earth's \"civilizations\"? Popular Mechanics obviously recog- nizes that putting \"UFOs\" on the cover helps sell magazines. Pity they couldn't use non-fiction articles. www.stantonfriedman.com fsphys@rogers.com Newsletters appreciated The MUFON UFO Journal staff ap- preciates receiving newsletters from lo- cal MUFON groups.

February 2004 MUFON UFO Journal Page 19"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"By Jenny Randies Faking UFOs Recently I came under some fire on a British internet site because I had sug- gested, in passing, that, in certain circun> stances, it can be acceptable to delib- erately fake a UFO sighting. I think it is im- portant to try to de- fend this contro- versial idea, and to explain my reasons for believing it. Firstly, I should explain the context in which I made this Jenny Randies comment. A. UFOlogist in the UK claims to have in- vestigated a sighting during which an RAF aircraft might have been downed after a close encounter with a UFO. An- other UFOlogist who had investigated the same case reached very different con- clusions-namely that there was no jet crash and that the UFO was prosaically explained as an astronomical phenom- enon. Such disputes happen all of the time, and those who have not investigated the case can form their own judgement by balancing the evidence from both UFOlogists and deciding what we think most probably occurred. However, in this case a colleague of the skeptical UFOlogist chose to go one step further and organise a hoax story that tied in with the jet crash, hoping to sucker in the investigator with opposing views on the incident and, presumably, exposing his shortcomings if he fell for the deception. As things transpired he did not get entirely caught by the ruse, which, when it was admitted some time later by the skeptical UFOlogist, stirred up a heated discussion on the rights and wrongs of this attempted hoax. I am not endorsing the methods used in this particular case-although I under- stand why they were considered neces- sary by the skeptic. Personally, I would draw the line at deliberately trying to de- ceive specific individuals unless doing so was the only way to reveal important information that the UFO community needed to see. Here, I believe, the case could best have been argued over through the relative strength of the evi- dence for each interpretation of the facts. The setup detracted from that pure de- bate and put the issue into a personal- ized framework that distracts most people from what really matters. Which is why I personally would not have considered doing it. So when I argued that hoax experi- ments can benefit UFOlogy 1 was not defending any one example. Rather I was countering the view that this sighting had generated: that if one UFOlogist sought to hoax any UFO incident that might potentially deceive a colleague, then this was not only utterly unaccept- able, it was a heinous offense. On the contrary I believe that it some- times can be of great value. How can I justify such a suggestion? There are three reasons. Witness perception Firstly, it is important to gain specific information on witness perception. In UFOlogy that is often impossible, be- cause we rarely know for certain what was seen, and so almost always cannot judge how accurate are the accounts of even the most basic parameters, such as size, speed, time of observation etc. Yet knowing how well witnesses re- port such information is invaluable. It helps us to grasp how to evaluate the mass of eyewitness testimony regarding genuine UFO sightings. So, it makes sense that from time to time we run observational experiments where we create an IFO that we know will fool witnesses. This should be done un- der carefully controlled conditions as a properly organized experiment, and all the necessary permissions granted and pre- cautions taken so as to ensure that no dangerous situations follow. If run correctly this research can pro- vide the raw data that tells us how un- usual stimuli in the sky are being wit- nessed and reported. I consider this good research, not a deception. Many other professions use similar techniques to gather data. Reporting/investigating process A second reason that it can be valu- able to conduct hoax experiments is to test the reporting and investigation pro- cess. This is a little more tricky to justify, but it can be beneficial to use a well set up IFO as a method of tracing the various sources that will seek to investigate, re- port on, or otherwise use the sighting. By this route we can gain information on how to use media sources, based on the way they tackled a case that has been carefully controlled, and give dry runs to various investigation methods that might come in very handy in future real UFO cases. I should make very clear that I do not support this kind of experiment except under very strictly controlled circum- stances and at very exceptional times. For example, as a way of defining the chan- nels of communication in a UFO window area where we suspect that witness hoax- ing might be rife. Also I would not support it unless it was designed in such a way as to avoid bringing deliberate ridicule upon col- leagues. Moreover, it should be carefully docu- mented and the results published (again avoiding naming names and exposing colleagues just to score political points). This should also be done as soon as the experiment is over. Sitting on data for any length of time turns what might be a bona fide experiment into a cruel hoax carried out without due concern for our compatriots. That I could not condone. Improving standards The third way in which hoaxing a sighting can be useful is to improve stan- dards. There was a very good example of this in the UK some years ago when a hoax photo of a UFO from a hot spot in Wiltshire was seeded into the UFO com- munity. The experimenters deliberately in- cluded within the case sufficient clues to at least allow for serious doubts to be entered into, or even for the hoax to be exposed if. the investigation was con- ducted with enough depth. It became more of an examination of the skills of those UFOlogists who pitted themselves against the case. As such, when the truth emerged, those who suc- ceeded in sensing the dubious nature of the photo could judge that their approach to. cases was working, whereas those who Page 20 MUFON UFO Journal February 2004"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"had not spotted the clues could re-evalu- ate their way of investigating all poten- tially real UFO photographs. It was noticeable to me that not many UFOlogists who failed this test saw it in a remotely favorable light.They railed against the perpetrators as if they were intending to make all UFOlogists look foolish. There were even charges of du- plicity or that they were agents of disinformation. But viewed as I think it was intended, as a controlled test of in- vestigator capabilities, it had the power to benefit the whole UFO community and to raise standards if it had been taken in the right spirit. I would add, before anyone gets the wrong idea, that I have never set up or been involved in any hoaxes of the kind outlined here. Or indeed of any kind. I only ever would do so in very special cir- cumstances and if I can see positive ben- efits for UFOlogy that outweigh the criti- cism that such experimentation will always inevitably draw. These conditions would not occur very often - indeed if we started hoaxing left, right and center then this would rap- idly become very much the wrong thing to do. So I would have to think long and hard before agreeing to participate in any such operation. My point is only that I think there are times when it is genuinely in the interests of our subject to consider the possibility. However contentitious anything that brings useful data and can improve the quality of our work is at least open to argument.

Mars (1.2), in Taurus, is next in line higher up in the WSW and sets in the WNW about 11 PM. The ruddy world can be seen very near the crescent Moon on March 25. Saturn (0.0), in Gemini, hangs high up in the S at dusk, shifting westward after dark. Previously retrograding (illusory westward orbital motion), the ringed planet resumes its normal eastward or- bital direction on the 7th. Jupiter (-2.5), in Leo, reaches a point opposite the Sun (opposition) on the night of March 3-4. At that time the giant planet will be visible all night.

I have been researching this for the past eight years, and I believe that it is rel- evant to the UFO mystery. It should con- cern anyone who is looking at all aspects of the UFO mystery. The event occurs when a person, usu- ally someone connected with ufology or an abductee, awakens from a sleeping state to a waking state and notices the digital clock displaying a time, such as 2:22 AM or more often 3:33 AM, 4:44 AM etc. These times occur over a period of months and years at irregular intervals. They may occur to one family member, or all members of the family. In one case I have been documenting since 1994, the husband and wife will sometimes awaken at the same times, although this is rare. The phenomenon usually involves other significant events associated with abductions or alien entities, but there are also times when no events are present. These wakings sometimes occur on aus- picious dates, such as Christmas Eve. Sometimes the person remembers dreams of events that seem very real. Other times they simply wake up startled and note that the time on the clock is 3:33 or another such time. Since these times are repeated, there is somewhat of a pattern. In some cases there are physical anomalies present on the body. Those of you who have read Raymond Fowler's book, The Andreasson Legacy, will notice that in the back of the book there is a chart with these significant wak- ing times of 3:33,2:22, etc. It would seem to me that this is signifi- cant by the very fact that it does occur repeatedly to those who have had experi- ences in ufology, and that it occurs when one is waking_from a sleeping state. Also worth noting is the fact that some of these people, while driving in their car, will feel the urge to look at the digital clock, and when they do they notice that the times are 2:22,3:33,4:44, etc. I have documented the times of one family over the past seven years, and it seems that for this family at least the 3:33 AM time is very prominent. There you have it folks. I don't claim to have the answer to this event-and I'm not sure that it has to do with time as we think of it. However, I do think that it is worth taking a serious look at. 1 would like to thank Jerry L. Sievers, Indiana State Director, for his help in researching this, and his encouragement to me to document it. If anyone has any input into this Significant Waking, please send me an e-mail at zulu_28@hotmail.com. -Roger Sugden The Aztec \"crash\" I am concerned over what appears to be a positive spin on the long discredited Aztec Saucer Crash of 1948 (or whatever year you choose). The best explanation has always been that a couple of con artists formed a con- fidence scheme out of flying saucers and early crash rumors. The idea was to help them sell phony oil property with the idea that they had a special \"doodle-bug\" de- vice from the crash of a flying saucer which could detect oil. The lucky marks would be let in on this \"hush, hush\" secret discovery. People like to be in on such secrets, especially if they will make you money. And UFOs were making enough appearances in the Southwest to create a plausible con! So I ask readers to beware of such mi- raculous \"doodle-bug\" schemes. Even those which may be peddled today? -Brian Parks A puzzling sighting On Dec. 31,2000, at approximately 7:15 AM, I observed a craft in the desert near my home, which is Pearce, AZ. This sight- ing was very unsettling to me, and I wanted to ensure my recollections were clear. Immediately upon arriving home I drew to the best of my ability the craft I had observed. I'm writing now to see If anybody else has reported a design of this kind and, if it may be military or a true UFO. I had driven off the side of the high- way and got out of my vehicle to stand outside in order to observe it. Much re- garding the craft was only coming back to me many months after the sighting. This craft was definitely metallic. Prior to the craft gaining altitude it rotated somewhat and came very close to me. I saw two visible windows that were, to me, completely black, but were very deeply inset. At that point, I became afraid and The object reported by Hovdestad found myself standing\" behind my vehicle observing it. As this craft was traveling from the S W to the NE in front of me, I found myself looking away to the left at the ground, and would look back again at the craft to make sure I was seeing what was traveling across my view. The craft tilted in the opposite direction from me to gain altitude. I saw a huge glowing circular spot on the underside of the craft. What I thought were legs proved to be a power source that was perfectly formed, but as the craft gained altitude it made a hissing noise. The upper stack was so pro- nounced that it looked out of proportion to the rest of the craft. (See drawing above.) I saw no visible markings, no ingress or egress on the craft, but it was defi- nitely metal, as the sun was just coming up and the top portion of the craft was reflecting the sun. I was able to hold my hand up in comparison to the craft as it was closest to me. The craft was visible on both sides of my hand while it was fully extended from my body. This vehicle traveled to the NE until it faded from my view. As a former para- trooper of the 101st Airborne, I am well aware of what a human's definition of a craft being able to fly and not fly. This craft had such a profound effect on my emotions that for at least the following 18 months I would think of it on a daily ba- sis. The first year I would feel like crying for some unknown reason when thoughts of this craft would enter my mind. This is the first time that I have gone public with this information, although I have told close friends and my family of this inci- dent. -Stanley M.
