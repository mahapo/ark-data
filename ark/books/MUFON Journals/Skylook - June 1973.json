UFOs Continues - Physics Department Head Says Lights Follow High Frequency Paths - Research Chemist Says \"Plasma\" #;£# ; ; ; £##$#***#*###**###**#**####^ The Piedmont UFO story continues. News clips continue to come in, and again we thank all who send them—too many for separate listing, but each one appreciated. In a story out of the St. Louis \"PostrDispatch\" John H. Mullen, a research chemist working primarily in the field of plasma gas at the. McDonnell Douglas Research Laboratories made two trips to Piedmont to satisfy his own curiosity, not in connection with his work. He is an amateur astronomer and took a 400-power telescope with him. h e saw some of the UFOs pointed out by viewers and said they were defin- itely stars. He says stars do have an unusual appearance in the Piedmont area because of the lakes and high water causing excess moisture in the air, giving a prism or rainbow effect to bright stars, especially near the horizon. M I didn T t see any of the glowing balls that have been reported, but the people who have sighted them give descriptions that exactly fit hot plasma gas. Plasma balls never have been completely verified, but they are akin to ball lightning,\" Mullen said. Glowing balls of plasma gas usually are reported in the general area of high-voltage power lines, Mullen said. All reports of the glowing balls of light in the Piedmont area have been near a high- tension line, he said. In the May 3rd edition of the Maiden \"Press-Merit,\" a story out of Cape Girardeau states that Dr. Harley D. Rutledge, head of the physics department at Southeast Missouri State University, at Cape, says the mystery lights he has observed in the Piedmont, Mo., area appear to follow very high frequency omnidirectional (VORJ flight paths. Dr. Rutledge, one of a university team attempting a scientific study of the phenomenon, said he observed four lights April 13, three from the north and one from the south, following VOR lines. \"I am not going to speculate, but just report what I observed,\" he said. \"However, we are looking for correlations in our data to give us a clue as to the type of phenomena.\" VOR beacons emit a high frequency omnidirectional signal, used by pilots in navigation along their flight paths. Two of the moni- range signals intersect above Brushy Creek near Piedmont. These paths are from a station at Vichy, in the south central part of the state, to Maiden in the Bootheel, and from Farmington, Mo., to Wal- nut Ridge, Ark. Rutledge said the first light he observed was about 7:15 p.m. He described it as \"a white light, brighter than any of the stars, which did not appear to have any shape.\" H e said it passed in front of him and his observers, from noth to south at an angle of 10 degrees, and was visible about three minutes. '1'he second sighting was at 7:27, the third at 9:20 and the final sighting at 10:45. At a distance, the lights appeared to have color, but seemed white as they approached. He checked the Federal Aviation Administration which confirmed there were no airplane flights in the Brushy Creek area at the time of the sightings. Dr. Sidney Hodges, Prof. Milton Uekeke and Dr. James £. Sage are working with Dr. Rutledge in their \"Project Investigation\"--equipment used includes radio communications, photography, light spectrum and polarization measurement."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Dr. Rutledge also checked with the Smithsonian Astronomical Obser- vatory in Cambridge, Mass., on the possibility that the lights could be caused by satellites. \"But Al Cornell, director of the Worldwide Moon Watch Team at the observatory told me he was of the opinion that what I observed could not be lights due to satellites in orbit,\" Dr. Rutledge said. At Charleston, Mo., roughly 50-60 miles east of Piedmont, Mrs. Dorothy Thompson was getting ready to watch the 3 o'clock movie on TV, the night of April.6. Her television set went off, then came back on and she saw a bright light flash in her kitchen. She looked out the back door and an egg-shaped object was at treetop level. The top was red and the bottom solid white. The lights did not flash and it made no sound, she reported to \"The Daily Standard,\" Sikeston, Mo., which carried the story on April 17- \"As God is my witness, it really happened to me, n she said. \"One may be skeptical about such things, but when one sees it with their own eyes, they know it is sol. . . it was really weird and unnerving.\" Ron Jaynes, of the \"Daily Standard\" staff received a call about 8:45 p. m. April IS that three UFOs were sighted west of Maiden. They were flying in a triangular pattern and seemed to be moving very fast. Each had red, green and amber lights which were flashing. Jaynes view- ed the objects for about five minutes, then called the Blytheville, Ark. Air Force Base. At that time, they reported nothing on the radar and reported no known planes in that area. The only known aircraft were about 60-SO miles west of the area in which the lights were seen. The radar did pick up two small objects that were stationary and which the air base watched for about 40 minutes. They classified these as ground objects. Forty minutes later Jaynes called back to the air station. While he was talking to them, they picked up three objects in a triangular pattern that were apparently moving. The person manning the radar said he couldn T t explain it, but there was something there. The radar operators at the air station said they had heard about the sightings,apparent UFOs, but had not been contacted before to check on them. This account appeared in the April 19th \"Daily Standard.\" In the mean time in the Wayne County\"Journal-Banner,\" readers con- tinue to report seeing UFOs, even in the items known as \"country correspondence\"—neighborhood news from various surrounding areas. Example—under \"Ellsinore News\" the following: \"Mrs. Nada Jett tells us she recently saw one of the Unidentified Flying Objects flying low at the Crites Corner home of Mrs. A. S. G. Carnahan, 4 miles west of Ellsinore. rt One Piedmont farmer reported damage to his fences because of excit- ed horses and cows running from UFOs. Another farmer said he was watching Channel 12 on television and the channel automatically changed to Channel 8 (which he never gets) when a UFO passed over his home. Both men said their night lights (set for from dusk to daybreak) went out when the UFO passed over their farms. It was reported that a \"landing site\" had been found in a wooded area near Ellsinore, but investigation disclosed that a tree had been struck by lightning and splintered about 20 feet above ground. Trees in the area having \"scars\" were examined and it was apparent these were caused by falling branches over a period of several years.

Power Plantand was going, around the bend coming up on the Wegley road when he observed a very large, white glowing object across the railroad tracks and just above the trees. The whole area was lit up by the glow from the object. The observer pulled off the road and .got out of his car to watch the object about 70-100 yards distant, and 400 yards east of the power plant. The object appeared to be about 10 feet above the tree-top level and lit up the entire area with a \"burning white glow.\" It was i described as being about 36 feet in diameter and \"like a spinning top.\" Ij -he light seemed to stay at the same intensity but was diffused on the edges. The object had a dome structure on top, with two or three rings of lights around the main section. There were square windows emitting different colored lights. i he witness is not positive, but believes one row of lights was white, another red, and the third of blue and green. The most interesting aspect of the sighting as reported to Stan Gordon, Director of the Westmoreland County UFO Study Group and State Director for MUFON, was the witness stating that \"something\" was out from the object and he compared it to \"how the Apollo men walked out in space, some kind of image like that.\" Out from the left center of the object appeared to be some type of rope or beam of light that extended out some 30 yards and was attached to some type of form. The witness was not quick to say it was a human form, but described it as \"like a torso or bulk about 8 to 10 feet tall and purple or orange in color.\" The witness did not actually see the object being retracted back into the craft but compared its disappearance to a string of lights all on one circuit going out when you turn the switch. AS soon as this happened, the object took off \"like a meteor\" and disappeared toward Harrison City. The object had been \"spinning\" while in a stationary position> The witness stated he had left the engine running and the lights on when he left his car. In about 3-4 minutes, .the engine stopped \"just like that\" (a click of the fingers) and the headlights went as dim as a weak flashlight, ^hen the object left the scene, the lights came on \"real bright\"--the witness started his car and went on to a gas station where he called the state police to report what he had seen. He said he had heard a high-pitched sound \"like a spinning top makes\" when the object took off. \"You could hear the trees blowing,\" he said, as the object went over them. The police referred the witness to Stan Gordon who reports the man was shaken by his experience and his voice was trembling as he described his experience. Other sightings were reported that night by a dozen witnesses or more in a mile area comprising the two small communities of Penn and Manor outside the city of Jeanette. J-t is a desolate area and is draped with 500 KV. high tension power lines and has frequently been the scene of unexplained UFO activity over the years. Some of the sightings reported that night were quickly identified as aircraft in the area, but it is obvious that a number of observers saw the same, or similar object, as reported above. It was quickly estab- lished that a sky ad aircraft from the M and D Corporation of Latrobe was not in use.. Editor's Note: We hope to report the other sightings at a later date. As we didn't have room for the complete report, we selected the mo t interesting sighting. In reading it, remember it was backed up by other reports, some with more than one witness."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"Missouri Man Sees UFO — Bill Brady, an employe of the Auto Body Chrysler plant at Fenton, Mo., was at the beck of his home in St. Louis, about 9:20 PM March 3, 1973 when he saw a glowing, orange- colored object moving at terrific speed about 75 feet above the ground. The object appeared to be about 40-45 inches in diameter and was disc shaped. to hen first seen it was hovering. The night was dark with no moon, but the orange glow from the object was so bright Brady could see objects (his childrens 1 toys included) on the ground of his back yard. He stepped outside for a better view, and the object moved off at \"terrific speed\" in \"a cork screw\" motion and seemed to drop sparks compared to sparks off hot metal. The witness spoke to five other adults in the area, who also saw the object, but did not want their names used in the report made to David Schroth and Bill Christian, of the UFO Study Groip of Greater St. Louis. Iowa Sighting; Recalled —Mrs. Helen T. Wark, 16 E. Parkway Ave., Chester, Pa., 19013, would like to know if others saw the same un- identified sky object she and other witnesses observed sometime be- tween August 3-15, 1963. Mrs. Wark was visiting friends in Fairfield, Iowa, and all were sitting on the lawn watching the Pleiades meteor shower. To their surprise a round object with a yellow-white glow and a black ring around the center passed overhead and later returned, again overhead, but apparently at a much higher altitude. There was no sound of a motor, but a faint humming sound could be detected.No one present believed the object to be a plane, but had no solution. We hope some o- our Iowa readers will check their files for sightings at this time—and let us know what they find. Another Round Object With Band Seen — Andre Lipa, of LaGrange, 111., and a friend were on a fishing trip near Fremont, Wisconsin, in 1962 when they saw an object whose description fits the object seen by Mrs. Wark (above). It was May 23rd on a clear night with a full moon. The two men saw the object about 2 AM. When first seen the object was overhead heading west. It stopped briefly, hovered, moved to the north and then again to the west where it disappeared from view. Lipa said the object was round, a bright orange in color and seemed to have a wide band around the middle. There was no sound. The report was made to Larry P. Rybak, a MUFON state-section director for Illinois* MUFON Investigator Tells of Sighting — Larry P. Rybak, now state- section director of MUFON for Illinois, recalls UFOs seen by himself and three companions in the spring .or early summer of 1966. They were in a car on Ogden Avenue, Naperville, 111., about 9 PM when all observed three oVal-shaped objects .moving in formation in the western sky. They stopped the car to get out for a better view of the objects which hovered and moved from right to left in aimless fashion, then suddenly \"flew off north faster than anything known\" in formation and disappeared. The objects were described as being as bright or brighter than a full moon and surrounded by \"a slight fuzz.\" There was no sound and no vapor trail. The men reported the sighting to the police and to the air force. Youths Photograph UFO in California — Richard Coimbra and Curt Huettner, both 15, Thousand Oaks, California, were filming a movie for a class on Feb. 3, 1973. Using still photography the youths had mounted the word- ing for a title shot on a piece of glass and were shooting skyward to catch the effects l of the clouds."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"Theytook a picture of an object which they estimated to be per- haps 300 feet in the air end one half to three quarters of a mile away from their site. Curt though the object might be 70 feet in diameter. \"It was silent. There was no hum, flame or smoke and it looked to be rotating. We saw it for about 30 seconds then it went behind the trees and clouds and out of view.\" Before seeing the object, the boys noticed three or four regular commercial planes in the area and at first thought the object they photographed to be one, then were convinced it was not. Curt, who is interested in the space program, thinks the object could be some kind of government experiment. Richard, who says both his father and his grandfather have^seen UFOs, thinks intelligent life from some other galaxy may have been piloting the aircraft. A picture of the \"UFO\" and a report of the sighting appeared in the March 20th edition of the Thousand Oaks \"News-Chronicle\" and was sent to us by Lt. Col. R. F. Bowker, a MUFON state section director for California, along with his report of an interview with Curt Huettner. UFO Crosses Road in Front of Michigan Couple — On the night of December 2, 1972, Mr. and Mrs. Charles E. Stanley and their granddaughter, Lisa Baker, 8, were driving from Adrian to Saline, Michigan when they ob- served what appeared to be a metallic object with a long yellow tail to the right of their car. This object curved and flew across the road in front of them at a distance of approximately 50 feet. It then con- tinued its arc to the left where it disappeared as if \"turned off.\" It is interesting to note that Saline is 13 miles from Dexter, Mich- igan, the site of the 1966 \"swamp gas\" sighting. Stanley, 47, of Ann Arbor, has been employed as a machine set-up man with the same firm for nearly 30 years. He impressed the investi- gator, Robert L. Stinson, a State-Section Director for MUFON, as being a sincere, mature person who has been troubled by his exper- ience and is desperately trying to find some explanation for the sighting. Mrs. Stanley, employed as check auditor in the bookkeeping department of an AnnArbor bank, made an equally good impression. Neither were versed on UFOs and did not \"believe\" in them prior to their experience. The weather was unseasonably warm for December and the sky was partly cloudy. There was some snow on the rolling farm fields near Saline* The Stanleys were returning to Ann Arbor by way of Saline follow- ing a church meeting and a shopping trip in Adrian. They were heading northeast on U. S. 12 (Michigan Avenue), a route quite familiar to them as they had traveled it many times. Mrs. Stanley was at the wheel of their 1972 Oldsmobile and the sighting took place at approximately ij miles southwest of Saline at 10:15 PM. No other cars were nearby at the time of the sighting, nor do they recall any conventional air- craft in the vicinity. Their attention was directed .to a bright, fiery object to their left and about 100 feet perpendicular to the direction of the car. They estimated the object to be approximately 75 feet above the ground. Both adults had the impression they were watching a plane on fire and crashing. Mrs. Stanley slowed the car to 10 mph to avoid danger from any explosion or flying debris. The object was moving at a \"slow plane speed.\" Its path was described as a rough semicircle around the car from right to left. When the object was directly in front of the car, it made a sudden maneuver which the witnesses attributed to \"recog- nition\" of their car being unexpectedly closeby. However, further investigation revealed the object most likely maneuvered over or under"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"some high-tension power lines which cross the highway at precisely that spot. The witnesses agreed that the object, when directly in front of the car, was about 50 feet distant (possibly 75 at most), about 30 feet above the road, and Viewed at approximately a 30 de- gree angle. The sighting ended abruptly when the object \"winked out like a light\" when it was off to their left over a field, •'•hey estimate the object was 200 feet from the car and 50-75 feet in the air when it .went out. In retrospect they both feel the fire was actually a strong, bright light attached to a physical object which maneuvered to avoid their car. They did not feel that fire or red hot material could \"turn off\" as quickly as it appeared to. The leading part of the object appeared to be a pale silver-blue metallic lopsided sphere with a long smoothly tapered tail and a shorter top fin. The long ta^j, first described as a flame, was later thought to be a cone of pale yellow-white light projecting back from the sphere a distance of approximately 50 feet and on a slight incline., The witnesses stated an alternative explanation was that this cone of light was actually reflecting off or from a surface. The small fin was described as being a vivid bright orange, the color of red hot metal. On the underside of the sphere and towards the rear (under long tail) there appeared to be some shiny material that twirled, sparkled, or scintillated. Just before the object extinguished, this \"sparkler-like\" area seemed to be more noticable. The object maintain- ed the same attitude or profile towards the witnesses in the car throughtout its arc. The Stanleys extimated the size of the sphere as 12 feet in diameter and felt it subtended about 4 inches (verti- cally) at arms length, '•'•'his would figure out to be approximately a 13 foot diameter using an estimated distance of 75 feet and 22 inches as arms length, '^'he tail was 3 to 4 times the length of the sphere, and the fin projected 4 feet from the object at between a 45 and 60 degree angle. The witnesses emphasize that the most startling part of their observation was the way in which the object \"winked out.\" The Stanleys continued into Saline and stopped for a cup of coffee . . \"to gather our wits. n They then went to the police station to report the sighting. The police report that Stanley was highly agi- tated when he came in and that initially they did not believe his report. An armed robbery occurred shortly after the Stanley report, and no patrol cars could be spared to investigate the UFO incident at the time.Other reports of lights/objects in the sky were telephoned in, but again they were not able to investigate. A check with the Washtenaw County Sheriff Department revealed that they too had received several calls about UFOs near Saline, and they dispatched a car to investigate. However, the car was detoured to the robbery site in Saline and the report was forgotten. Both the Clinton and Ypsilanti posts of the Michigan State Police received reports of UFOs in the general vicinity and a patrol car from the Clinton post was dispatched to investigate—and it was sidetracked due to a bad traffic accident on U. S. 12 near Clinton. Unfortunately, none of the police agencies bothered to record the names of people making the calls. One did remember the name of Douglas but further investigation was unable to locate anyone by that name who had witnessed the\" sight- ing. Mr. Stanley returned to the SaDine Police department the next morning and he and Officer Connor inspected the scene of the sighting with no result. Also, Dispatcher Walters searched surrounding fields on both sides of U. S. 12 for over 3 hours with nothing unusual found. Inspection of Stanley's car failed to show any burns or other strange 9"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"effects. Inspection of the terrain where the object was alleged to have disappeared showed no drop off or hill that could have suddenly obscured vision, so its sudden \"winking out\" remains unexplained. In concluding his excellent report of the investigation, Mr. Stinson states he believes the witnesses saw \"a truly unexplainable phenome- on.\" We agree. Two Pilots Report Chasing UFO Near Missouri Town — Farmington, Mo. Two experienced pilots have told of chssing a glowing disc-shaped object near this southeast Missouri town before it outdistanced them in a burst of speed. The aerial pursuit by Kenneth Pingel, a commercial pilot with more than 5,000 flying hours to his credit, is only one of the latest in a growing list of reported sightings of what many people in southeastern Missouri are calling an unidentified flying object. Pingel said he was about to land his single-engine plane at the Farmington airport the night of April 12 when he and another pilot with him, Marvin C 0 lyer, first saw the strange light off the left wing tip. \"The object was circular shaped and looked off-white in color, gradually turning yellow and taking on an orange tinge,\" he said. \"It did not appear to spin.\" As the plane made its final approach to land, Pingel said it looked like the object was directly in the plane f s flight path. \"It looked like it was moving at us at a high rate of speed, so I pulled back and flew toward it,\" he said. \"It immediately stopped, re- versed its direction and flev; away from us at a high rate of speed.\" Pingel said he chased the object at 140 miles per hour for'several miles before it disappeared. Colyer corroborated the story. \"We're both qualified for night operations and I've flown, many nights under all kinds of conditions,\" Pingel, 23, explained. \"This was definitely not a star or any kind of airplane and until someone explains to me what it is, I guess I'll have to say I saw a UFO.\" Source: \"Log Cabin Democrat,\" Conway, Ark., April 23rd.

Monday night. He and several neighbors saw the object go overhead and the boy teased the others, saying it was a UFO. Actually, he said, no one could figure out what it was. Then the object returned, lower in the sky. J-t came to a dead stop about a half mile away. While it wes moving it cast a flashing red light, which changed to another color and then went back to red. But when it stopped, a big white light appeared, Barker said. The object made no sound* The police suggested to Barker the object could possibly be a balloon, but Barker doesn't buy that. Not interested in UFOs until this incident, Barker says he now believes many people don't report UFOs because \"people think you're crazy.\" Collinsville police relayed the sighting to Scott Air Force Base. Officials there say they get four or five UFO reports every month.They don r t do any investigating, but forward the reports to the FAA at Lambert Field. Source: \"Collinsville (111.)

C., 27030, has investigated, written and lectured in the UFO field for many years end is so well known as to need no introduction except to those who are just developing an interest in unidentified flying objects . Mr. Fawcett is a State Section Director for MUFON. After 26 years of global UFO activity we now know what UFOs do, but are still unable to determine their nature and origin. Many patterns of UFO activity were documented by the late Charles Fort in 1934 in West Virginia and since that time others have been discovered. Below are listed the well known and documented repetitions of UFO activity that we can count on in 1973• In fact, most of these repetitions have already occurred during the first quarter of 1973 (January-March). We must seek and find explanations for the following listed UFO repeti- tions if we are able to obtain an eventual solution to the mystery of un- identified flying objects (UFOs) in our life time. Scientific studies should be so designed along these lines in the near future. (I) Sightings of unknown flying objects that demonstrate superior speeds end intricate maneuvers beyond those of present satellites, rockets, space probes, aircraft and missiles. (2)Radar trackings of UFOs, many times with simultaneous-radar and visual observations. (3) Photos and movie films of UFOs. (4) Pursuit of UFOs by planes in the skies and by cars on open high- ways. (5) Falls of \"fragments\" and \"Angel Hsir,\" both metallic and non- metellic substances from UFOs overhead or from ground level. (6) Increases in background radiation above normal after UFOs report- ed in the skies and on the ground. (7) Near collisions and head on passes by UFOs reported by both mili- tary and civilian planes. (£) Physiological effects such as electric shock, radiation burns, dimming of vision, blackouts, amnesia, weightlessness, temporary paraly- sis, blood disorders, deaths, etc. of observers in close UFO encounters both in the air and on the ground. (9) Electro-magnetic (E-M) interference reports caused by UFOs on compasses, plane and car motors, headlights, houselights, searchlights, radar beams, radios, TV, wrist watches, electric clocks, communication devices, telephones etc. (10) Skyquakes, sonic booms, a variety of sounds detected during UFO appearances. I11 ) Smells such as ozone, sulfur, ammonia etc during UFO encounters. (12) Landings and near landings (hovering) of UFOs and their occupants. (13) Hostile acts due to UFOs (both towards and from these objects) with increased shooting incidents by both frightened eye witnesses and provoked UFO occupants. Various devices will be tested utilizing waves of light and waves of sound. (14) Reports of so-called 'contactees 1 of space visitors and UFOs. (15) Straight lines of flight related to UFOs. (16) Reputable sightings by scientists, astronomers, physicists, pilots, police, astronauts, control tower personnel, radar trackers, and other trained and competent observers of UFOs. (17) Appearance of \"little men\" (apparently hunanoids) and other type occupants in relation to worldwide UFO landings, hoverings, who will be reported to have taken rocks, vegetation, soil, water, sand, animals, 11"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"flowers etc. Additional cases of human kidnappings. (IS) Periodic cycles of UFO increased sightings every 26 months, 5 years and 10 years in large numbers. 1973 has already produced a large global \"wave of UFO sightings.\" (19) Unique shapes of UFOs, especially discs, domed saucers, cigar or rocket-shaped objects, crescents and half-globes. (20) Revolving wheel-like machines in oceans, seas, vast masses of water such as lakes and rivers also reservoirs reported by witnesses aboard ships, planes and by ground observers. (21) Depressions, craters, holes, markings, burned areas on the ground due to UFO worldwide landings. (22)Increased power failures due to UFO activity, with possible occasional blackouts in both local and large areas as well. (23)Severe animal reactions to close approaches of UFOs. (24) Increased private, public, scientific, military, theological, news media interest in this growing, global international scientific problem.

'J-'he Delphos case was one of more than 1,000 claims for a $50,000 award for the first person \"who can prove a UFO came from outer space and was not a natural phenomenon.\" The Enquirer panel composed of Dr. J.

The following from Mrs. Druffel is from a letter and we have her permission to use it just as written:— Another \"blimp\" case turned up in Tarzana, Calif., a city about 15 miles northwest of North Hollywood, which was the scene of some of the sightings discussed in the enclosed report. / See aboveT/ The Tarzana case occurred Arril 10, 1973 (within the time period of the Los Angeles Basin flap!) Two adults and a child saw a \"huge, light- ed object with indescribable patterns of light flashing on and off. No advertising letters were seen. One of the light patterns involved the entire bottom of the object, which was tent-shaped on the top and rounded on the bottom. This light pattern was bright yellow, which is synonymous with one of the colors of the blimp, but the yellow pattern on the blimp is a yellow band around the center. The woman I interviewed swore it was not just a yellow band, but a light which glowed around the entire bottom. The object seemed very close to the witnesses and seemed to be hovering close to the ground over a vacant lot across the street. As it moved off after five or ten minutes, two other objects, flashing weird, similar light patterns joined it and the three flew off in a more or less straight line! I called the blimp base and sure enough the blimp was in the Van Nuys area at the time of sighting (7:30 p.m.}. Van Nuys is some 6-10 miles to the southeast of Tarzana. The woman would not accept the blimp expla- nation. She has seen the lights on the blimp snd knows the shape of the blimp and she swears the object she saw had a different shape entirely. Note the similarity here with at least two of the witnesses to the Santa Ana blimp case / See March issue of SKYLOOK7 who swore the object was of a different shape than the blimp, even though the light patterns might have been similar. The official at the blimp base to whom I talked this time is getting puzzled. He can't understand how the blimp can have been flying around this area since 1967 with its multicolored lights and \"only now is being mistaken for UFOs.\" Frankly, I am getting a little puzzled too. Is it possible that UFOs are imitating the lights on the blimp for unknown reasons of their own? Editor T s Note: In a follow up letter, Mrs. Druffel writes: \"I've since talked to persons who have seen the blimp cruising around Los Angeles skies, with all 7>000+ colored light bulbs and they swear in no way could it be mistaken for other than itself. T It has Goodyear written all over it,' is the favorite comment. Needless to say, neither the Tarzana or Santa Ana witnesses saw any 'Goodyear 1 on the object they were viewing! But I don't want to go off the deep end. It is just an interesting situation, and one to keep our eyes on.\" Caving read a number of Mrs. Druffel's carefully investigated and well written reports, we go along with any judgment she makes, and we 1 re looking forward to learning more about what certainly is \"an interesting situation.\" To Our Readers : Guess we better not announce articles for \"next month\" as we couldn't find room again for some fine material we planned to use this time. We'll try again next month. We DO appreciate all copy sent in and the best will appear in SKYLOOK sooner or later.

The sky was dark, but clear, at 2 AM in February, 19&7 when three women—Mrs. Ruth Phillips, 54; Nita De Agio, 23; and Mrs. Margaritta Espinosa, 21, the latter driving, were going home from work at the Du-Shay Almond Company in Orland, California. They had passed through Orland and were heading out into the flat Sacramento river valley toward Hamilton City about six miles to the east. Stoney Creek is a wide,sandy, and winding stream bed averaging 100 to 200 feet in width as it meanders lazily across the farm fields to join the-river. Its actual water width in the sandy bed is probably 10 to 12 feet across. An occasional patch of brush and a few trees here and there dotjts path. At the bridge on State Highway 32, a large sand and gravel company utilizes the vast supply of this material at the left side and on the approach to the long bridge. As the car passed over the last section of the low railing bridge, off to the right side in a large sandy section of the stream bed about 150 feet away, an explosion and brilliant flash of white light startled the three occupants of the car. Immediately an elongated object with a row of square port holes, or small windows, ballooned into view. The object rose swiftly at an angle of about 45 degrees, climbing upward in the same direction the car was traveling to about a half mile away at an elevation of 45 to 50 degrees from the observers. lj -'he speed of the car was about 55 mph after leaving the bridge area and on into the open country, ^he UFO paced the car at this speed for approximately six miles to the edge of Hamilton City where it suddenly zoomed upward and headed in the direction of Sacramento at high speed. During the six mile pacing period the strange craft veered in fairly close to the car three times. On one approach the observers thought it was going to cross over the road in front of the car but it returned to its respective position about a quarter to half mile away each time. Mrs, Phillips described the UFO as cigar shaped. She said it reminded her of a submarine—the first comparison to come to mind. It appeared very metallic, apparently a dark color, but intricate details of the craft were difficult to distinguish because of the intense white light emanating from the row of square windows--so bright, the light hurt her eyes. i- he size of the object was estimated as two to three times the size of the car. There was no sound audible over the car engine noise, no E.M. effects and no exhaust trail visible, '•'•he object did not make any noticeable change of shape. As they were approaching Hamilton City, the younger women, though nervous £-nd apprehensive, began joking about seeing little men in the creft windows, but Mrs. Phillips said she was sure they were just joking as all she could see was the bright light coming from the square windows, .Several times in relating the event, Mrs. Phillips brought up the explosion sound they all heard on the bridge as the UFO took off and startled them. She described it asjust one big \"pop\" like a champagne cork, or a concussion air pop, as someone one popping an air filled paper bag. Unfortunately, a return to the take-off spot the next day or later did not occur to the witnesses, as possible evidence might have been found„ 1 6"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"The Constellations - Ursa Minor (The Lesser Bear) ASTRONOMY '' NOTES Ursa Minor means \"The Lesser Bear \" and covers the $ * * ? ? north celestial pole.
