The person who we have to thank for enabling us to contact him was our friend and UFO researcher from Leon, Guanajuato, Jose Luis Elizondo. What follows is an extraordinary experience, as described by Carlos Antonio: My experience began on the third of May of 1975.1 was flying a Piper PA-24 aircraft, working for a com- pany called Pelletier, S.A. The initial flight was from Mexico City to Lazaro Cardenas, also known as Melchor Ocampo del Balsas or \"La Villita,\" between Michoacan and Guerrero. There is a steel mill in Lazaro Cardenas, and the job consisted of flying company personnel to Lazaro Cardenas. After we landed in Lazaro Cardenas, the passengers got off the aircraft, and I was asked by the company to immediately fly back to Mexico City. I proceeded to do my return flight plan, but when attempting to start the aircraft's engine, it ,did not start. After searching for a couple of hours, I finally found a mechanic and brought him to the airport. He helped by passing electricity to the aircraft as if passing electric current to another auto. The aircraft's engine started immediately. However, it was already late to fly back to Mexico City, so I decided to stay overnight close by in Lazaro Zihuatanejo, Guerrero, which is a 40-minute flight. I parked the aircraft in the airport, found a hotel, ate a regular dinner, and went to bed early so I could be ready early in the morning to fly back to Mexico City. The next day I woke up early, took a bath, and had the following breakfast: two country style eggs, orange juice, and bread spread with jam. I mention this because later on there were some terrible misrepresentations about what I had or not eaten for breakfast. Many people believed I must have been starving, drugged, drunk, or suffering from hypoxia. After having breakfast I went back to the airport, wrote my return flight plan, now from Zihuatanejo, Guerrero to Mexico City. I was flying over Tequesquitengo, Morelos (The place where aircraft change direction and head to- wards Mexico City.) and checked the radio of Tequesquitengo (There is a radio here for aircraft navi- gation, a V.O.R. which is helpful when flying only on in- struments.) The aerial encounter Then I took magnetic course 004, when after three or four seconds I had the sensation that something was close to the left wing, something there watching. When turning myself to the left I saw a dark gray col- ored object, rat gray, oval shaped, yes, with a type of About the author Carlos A. Guzman Rojas, co-author of this report and MUFON representative for Mexico, spoke at the 1996 MUFON International Symposium in Greensboro, NC, on \"A Chronology of Ufology in Mexico.\" This report is from his latest book, UFOs and Mexican Aviation, which he co-authored with Alfonso Falazar Mendoza. control cockpit in the upper part, as a glass windshield, but dark. The inside of the object was not visible. After three or four more seconds elapsed, I had the same sen- sation over the right side of the aircraft. It was a second object with the same characteristics as the first one. When seeing this one, I began to feel very nervous, even cried. It was like having a strange dream or halluci- nations becoming real. I mention this because I have never drunk alcoholic beverages, never smoked, and have never consumed any drugs. After another few seconds, a third object approached the aircraft from the front, straight towards the windshield. It was similar to somebody throwing a ball straight at you. At that moment, I tried to push the aircraft's controls for- ward to miss the incoming object, but while doing this, I lost control of the aircraft, unable to descend, climb, or turn left or right. An emergency call The strange objects over the aircraft's wings appar- ently had taken control over the aircraft, possibly forming some sort of field. By then I was very scared. I changed radio frequency to that of the emergency frequency. I began communicating with the Mexico Center and said: \"To Mexico Center, Mexico Center, from EXTRA-BRAVO-EXTRA-ALFA-UNION (XB-XAU), mayday, mayday, mayday,\" but not receiving any answer. The Mexico Center answered after the third emergency call request, saying: \"Go ahead. What is your emergency.\" I answered: \"I am flying from Zihuatanejo, checked Tequesquitengo at 3,000 meters (10,000 feet), and have three visible objects flying around the aircraft. One is lo- cated on the right wing, another on the left wing, and the third under the aircraft. The third came straight toward the aircraft from the front, ignoring the working propeller, and later hitting the underneath of the fuselage, next to the landing wheels, staying attached to that place. The other two are flying in a suspended position, not attached to the wings.\" I continued, saying: \"I have three visual objects around the aircraft, and I am not controlling the aircraft. The air- craft is under the control of some strange forces. I am not controlling the aircraft in any way.\" Then, one of the air traffic controllers of the Mexico Center said: \"Let's see. Take it easy captain, take it easy. Let us see. Slow the aircraft engine completely.\" I an- January 2003 MUFON UFO Journal"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"swered: \"Slowing down. I do not know why I am slowing it down.\" But the engine parameters did not change at all, even when slowing it down. When slowing the engine down, the noise of the propeller changes, but in this case there was no change. I sped it up again, and said: \"I already slowed it down, but there is no change. I sped the engine up again.\"  . Then I tried to turn to the left, to raise the right wing and touch the object there, or turn to the right, raising the left wing and touch the other object. I tried to lower the landing wheels to touch the object underneath. I had no control and was not able to turh.to any side or lower the landing wheels. They were apparently damaged by the im- pact with the third object when I heard it hit the bottom of the aircraft. They did not operate. The magnetic compass went hay- wire. At that moment, I quit paying any attention to it, because there is another magnetic compass, which is a horizon. It is what we call the directional rota- tor, and you adjust it according to the compass every 15 minutes. It functions according to the gyro- scope principle, but has precision and magnetic errors. If you fly over a mag- netized zone it makes mistakes. That is why you should consider the direc- tional rotation, but there were no changes in the instru- ments. When checking at Tequesquitengo, Morelos, I changed to magnetic direction 004, according to classical compass readings. From Tequesquitengo to Mount Ajusco range, it's about a flying time of 18 minutes, the time in which the three objects flew with me at a speed of 140 knots, which is the cruising speed of this aircraft to cover this distance. I checked Tequesquitengo at 3.000 meters (10,000 feet), and flying over Mount Ajusco range the aircraft was flying at 4,440 meters (14,800 feet). This means the three objects were flying the plane. This air- craft cannot fly above 4,500 meters (15,000-16,000 feet) because it does not have a pressurized cockpit: While I was flying over the Mount Ajusco range, the air traffic control tower of Mexico City contacted by ra- dio a Learjet aircraft, with license XC-SAG, a turbo re- actor of the government's Agricultural and Livestock Secretary, and warned: \"Listen, there is an aircraft in trouble. (The kind of emergency was not mentioned;) There is an aircraft in trouble in the second quadrant of the Mexico V.O.R. It checked Tequesquitengo, and it is now over the Mount Ajusco range. It has problems. Try to make visual contact with it and help it.\" This aircraft took off from the Mexico City Airport towards lake Texcoco, State of Mexico, made a turn to the northwest, checked Tlalnepantla, State of Mexico. Then they heard: \"Help the ALFA-UNION.\" The object on the left side rose vertically, and the roof- 50 anos do ent'UL-ntrtts top of the aircraft prevented me from looking at this ac- tion, but then it flew towards Popocateptl volcano, seeing this from the other window. Just imagine^ it must have been flying away at more than 900 kilometers per hour. Mexico Center radar picks up obj ects The object on the right side did not rise vertically up. Its motion was horizontal and following the object on the left side. I did not see again the one under the aircraft, but it must have followed the other two. At that moment the Mexico Center radar captured the three echoes which maneuvered in such a way that no air- craft back then could have made a simi- lar maneuver. The UFO made a 270-degree turn in a radius of less than 5 kilometers (3 miles) and flying at a speed of over 900 kilometers per hour. Some Mexicana de Aviacion aircraft pilots said they could fly at that speed with a 727 jet plane, but could not turn in such a small radius. Once the three objects left me be- hind, I completely recovered the con- trol of the aircraft. I could turn right and left, descend, climb, but still was quite scared. The aircraft was not out of control because I realized what was happening. I watched the instruments, listened, and exchanged communica- tion with the Mexico Center and the control tower. However, I was very nervous and began to speed up the aircraft to get as soon as possible to the Mexico City airport. Then I started to hear a strong increasing flow of air going into the aircraft, a dangerous sign of too, much speed. The structure of this small aircraft can be over- come by too much friction with the wind, and the tail end can come apart, as well as the wings, and the whole air- craft may tear to pieces. Therefore, I decided to take it easy, slow down, and try to land slowly and with caution. Emergency at Mexico City International I arrived into the Mexico City International Airport air space, did my procedure, and was authorized to land on the right airstrip No. 3. While on course for landing and while lowering the landing wheels lever, I discovered that it did not operate correctly. I lowered the wheels landing lever, waiting for the three green lights to come on, indict- ing that the landing wheels are down and locked in posi- tion. The aircraft had another lever indicating the mo- ment when the landing wheels were locked. I saw the three lights go on, but the locking lever remained halfway. I tell the control tower: \"I have a problem with the landing wheels, have three green lights, but also have a false indication aboard. Could you check for the three wheels with binoculars? The controller responded: \"Yes, you are authorized to come flying at control tower level so we can observe.\" When I passed, he said: \"Listen, your aircraft has the nose wheel.outside, the one on the right side is outside, Page 4 MUFON UFO Journal January 2003"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"the one on the left side is completely inside. Make an- other attempt to lower all landing wheels. Take your time.\" I made another attempt, and when passing again over the landing strip, I am told: \"The three front wheels are out at a 45-degree angle; they should be at 90 degrees. Continue at it captain. Try to land in normal conditions. The airport is already closed.\" (It was closed for one hour and 17 minutes due to the emergency.) I kept trying, and at the ninth trial an alternate emer- gency attempt worked to make the landing wheels func- tion properly. Being used to carrying some tools with me aboard, I took out a screwdriver, removed a register, and saw that a worm gear runs in there. When the landing wheels operate, the worm gear runs forward, and when the aircraft is airborne the worm gear runs backward. Observing that it stayed halfway, I introduced the screw- driver backwards to the motion of the worm gear, low- ered the wheels, and it snapped free, so I knew it was down. Wheels up or down? I tell the control tower that, apparently, I have freed the landing wheels mechanism, since the worm screw made its motion forward and backward, the wheels emerged, the three green lights are on, and the lever is completely forward. They tell me: \"Negative. The nose wheel is outside, same as the one on the right, but the one on the left side is completely in.\" I was reluctant to believe this. As an aircraft pilot, I knew in what shape the aircraft was. I knew that the three wheels were already down and locked in the land- ing position. The only problem was what the people on the ground were telling me (controllers, firemen, emer- gency personnel, and others). Some were observing and saying that the nose wheel was missing, others were say- ing that it was the one on the left side, others that the right one was in, and finally others could not see any of the three wheels at all. I knew the aircraft was ready for landing, thus telling the control tower: \"Mexico tower, do you know what, this is the eleventh try, I am attempting to land in the present conditions, not in the paved landing strip, but over the grassy part in between both paved landing strips. That's where I am landing.\" The control tower answers: \"Okay, authorized. You will need assistance.\" I answered: \"Yes, affirmative;\" As- sistance is firefighters and ambulances. But by then I knew the three wheels were down in landing position. The landing Directing the aircraft to the grassy area between air strips and with the landing wheels in position, using the air flaps and rudder, I landed the aircraft. The small plane came to a stop between 75 and 100 meters due to the high grass and weeds on the field, and this helped to brake the aircraft. I did not turn off the engine, opened the door, jumped out of the aircraft, and began to run. An ambulance with a firelighter caught up with me and tried to calm me down. They helped me aboard the ambulance, where they gave me some tranquilizers. They took me to the Medical Cen- ter of the airport, where they made the first medical evalu- ation. Since people thought I had arrived in the wrong physical condition, either drugged, drunk, starving, or with hypoxia, which is lack of oxygen in the blood, possibly caused by flying at high altitude. . All this happened on Sunday. On Monday I saw a phy- sician of the government's Communication and Trans- portation Secretary. On Tuesday I saw a Mexicana de Aviacion physician for another medical check up, and on Thursday another medical check up with Dr. Amezcua, a Mexicana de Aviacion physician. After all these medical check ups, they asked the then chief of the Mexico City airport- aircraft captain Augusto Ramirez Altamirano, what was my physical condition. He answered: \"The young man has nothing wrong with him. He is just very scared. He is nervous because of the ex- perience he underwent, and the emergency he found him- self in.\" By that time, information physicians and the press were pressing to be informed because they knew there was more going on, but did not know exactly what. They had seen the aircraft passing several times over the airfield, for one hour and 17 minutes. The press was pressuring so much that the Director of General Aeronautics prohib- ited any controller to make any personal statements. The press gets involved As the pressure continued and increased, this Director called controllers Emilio Estanol Lopez and Interian Diaz to headquarters. There, in two separate offices, he ad- vised them on what to tell the press, so that each one could issue a particular report as to what they experi- enced, what they saw on their radar screens, and con- cerning the aircraft pilot, what he experienced. A report was filed, and they finally asked Dr. Amezcua what was the situation. He answered: \"My professional conclusion, as Medical Aviation Director and as a physi- cian, is that this young man may have suffered from hy- poxia, a lack of oxygen in the blood, but I say this as a professional physician. But if the controllers detected something on radar screens, their statements should be given the proper credit, being obvious that radars cannot suffer from hypoxia, because it is a complex electronic machine, and of another nature.\" Next month, Part 2, The aftermath of the encoun- ter: Men in Black? 2002 Symposium Proceedings The MUFON 2002 International UFO Sympo- sium Proceedings book is available from MUFON Headquarters for $25 + $2.50 p&h (U.S.).

Burleson, Ph.D. I t is commonplace in all areas of human concern, but especially in the field of UFO studies, to ob- serve that governments are less than forthcoming with regard to informing the public about many matters of which there is at least some public right to know. The US government certainly partakes of its share in this tradition of silence, as do many (though not all) other national governments. The problem, of course, is not just that govern- ments remain silent about some things, but rather that those govern- ments actively conceal the truth. One may trace a certain tendency of this kind throughout history, but given everything we're now aware of, there is no'doubt that the twenti- eth and early twenty-first centuries will be known as the age in which the art of the coverup became a well-developed organizational skill. It goes without saying that secrecy is sometimes nec- essary. People in their right minds do not generally advo- cate stealing missile launch codes and spreading them across the front page of the New York Times. Similarly, most people would agree that an ongoing fed- eral investigation of crime constitutes a situation where the public does not have the right to know some of the details, precisely the reason why that situation is one of the nine legitimate reasons why a federal agency can refuse to release existing documents requested through the Freedom of Information Act. Most people would agree that a great deal of informa- tion concerning national security and foreign policy is suf- ficiently sensitive to be kept secret, at least for a time, again precisely the reason why that consideration is one of the nine FOIA exemptions justifying non-release of government documents. Some secrecy is not legitimate But clearly some secrets do not really need to be kept. There are secret matters of which the public has a legiti- mate right to know because (at least this seems a reason- able assumption) no danger to national security, foreign policy, law enforcement, privacy rights, or legitimate pro- prietary rights would accrue with the release of these matters. Foremost in our minds, naturally, in this field, is information relating to UFOs. The definition of the classification \"Top Secret\" (by Executive Order 12958, for example) is in fact that level of classification to be given any information, the unautho- rized disclosure of which could reasonably be expected to cause exceptionally grave damage to the interests of national security. One wonders how the government's admitting the truth about the Roswell crash, the Lubbock Lights, the Great Falls objects, the Tremonton objects, the Levelland close encounters, the Socorro landing, or countless other UFO cases could be construed as causing \"exceptionally grave damage,\" or indeed any damage at all, to the national security. But the point here is that what is interesting about coverups, when one looks closely, is their flawed logic. The logic is always flawed. Always. And there are two reasons for that: (1) Coverups are almost invariably put together in haste; and (2) coverups invariably require the suppression and distortion of logic, because logic works properly only for processes in which one tries to illuminate the truth, not processes in which one tries to conceal it. In short, there is almost never enough time, in coverup situations, to \"script\" a cover-story scenario sufficiently airtight to withstand the onslaughts of investigation over time, and the coverup artist always has the problem that the mission is to lie rather than to tell the truth. As Abraham Lincoln has said, \"No man has a good enough memory to be a successful liar,\" and this may be extended to suggest that no coverup \"script\" can be tight enough to last for- ever. An exception There are exceptions, of course, to the rule that coverups are done in haste. During World War II, the Manhattan Project, organized for the purpose of develop- ing an atomic bomb, was (justifiably) concealed by way of an intricate and carefully considered process of coverup, and the logic worked at least for as long as it was re- quired to, since the general public wasn't aware of the bomb until after Hiroshima. But for the matter that primarily concerns us here, the question of covering up UFO-related information, the dif- ference is that a UFO event, and the official need to re- spond to it, will virtually always occur suddenly, without warning, without opportunity for careful thought prior to the event or even subsequent to it. For example, the flaws in the logic of the Roswell Inci- dent coverup are legendary by now. Between the time of the crash and the time the Army was out in the desert gathering up pieces and bodies, there may have been, according to some time-line theories anyway, as few as six hours, and in the middle of the night at that, for the official powers to at least start getting a coverup \"act\" together that was supposed to withstand investigational scrutiny indefinitely. It's a matter of little wonder, then, that one finds all kinds of holes in the logic. Did they really suppose that no witnesses would drive by on Route 285 (one thinks of William Woody and oth- ers) and see armed military guards all up and down the Page 6 MUFON UFO Journal January 2003"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"highway, a difficult thing to account for if indeed nothing but a balloon had fallen? Did military and government officials really suppose that witnesses who were given dire threats to remain silent would forever do so, or that their children or grandchildren would never talk to any- one? When the military went to a lot of trouble in Gen. Ramey's office in Fort Worth on 8 July 1947 to make Maj. Jesse Marcel look like a fool because he suppos- edly didn't know his job well enough to recognize balloon debris, did no one suppose that it might seem strange, to some, that the same military powers turned around shortly after these events and gave Maj. Marcel, who presum- ably had embarrassed the entire Army Air Force in front of the whole world, a promotion to the rank of Lieuten- ant Colonel? And, by the way, the McMullen-Ramey logic fails spectacularly on the point of claiming that Maj. Marcel should have recognized a weather balloon, because he assuredly would have recognized one, precisely the rea- son why in truth the transported debris could not have been a balloon or any other common material. A simple syllogism The syllogism is simple. Major premise: Jesse Marcel by virtue of his training would have recognized balloon and radar target debris. Minor premise: he did not rec- ognize the material he had brought to Gen. Ramey's of- fice as balloon debris. Conclusion: the material Jesse brought to Ramey's office was not a shredded-up bal- loon. There are countless other problems with the logic of the Roswell coverup, but I think these illustrate the nature of the thing. In 1951 the Air Force, via a then more or less viably revitalized Project Grudge about to evolve into Project Blue Book, investigated the Lubbock Lights, a phenom- enon observed not only in Lubbock but all over West Texas. Their final words of wisdom? The now famous lights were highly reflective duck-bottoms. One may pick this apart so many different ways that it's hard to know where to start. It's sufficient, for ex- ample, to point out that if the objects seen over Lubbock and elsewhere were indeed birds, even assuming a great deal more reflectivity than would plausibly be the case, those birds, when reflecting city lights, say, could only have done so within a relatively narrow arc of trajectory. But the problem (for coverup artists) is that various witnesses whom I interviewed could remember the ob- jects traversing from 90 to 120 degrees of arc in the night sky, shining all the while. I also interviewed a witness who saw the objects from a vantage point out in the country, where there were no lights to reflect. Further, photo analysis shows the ob- jects to have had an airspeed of around 1,300 miles per hour, a little brisk for ducks. Again, one could raise so many different problems with the logic of the official explanation that it readily collapses under its own weight, and deserves to. In March of 2002 when I reopened the Levelland, TX, case of 2-3 November 1957,1 found again that the logic of the official cover story was, frankly, laughably flawed. Indeed it was a quirk of logic that led me to re- open the case to start with. During a previous trip my wife Mollie and I had taken to Levelland, I discovered a witness who had once known Sheriff Clem and his family, and who remembered the sheriff telling how military and government people had ordered him to keep quiet about anything he had seen or heard. Even given the intriguing nature of the Levelland high- way landings as described by witnesses in 1957,1 felt that this business of enjoining the sheriff to keep his mouth shut was altogether too much official angst to fit the cir- cumstances. In particular I suspected that there might be some physical landing-trace evidence, and I was not dis- appointed, as two new witnesses described a burn ring seen in 1957. Ball lightning a secret? Comically enough, the response, from what little offi- cial investigation was done at Levelland was that the ob- ject seen by witnesses could be accounted for by \"ball lightning.\" Immediately we run into a flaw in the logic here. If the phenomenon had indeed been ball lightning, it would have bordered on the idiotic for military and gov- ernment people to order the sheriff, in stern tones, not to talk about it. When I interviewed one of Sheriff Clem's daughters, she vividly recalled her father's saying that he had been told, succinctly enough, just to \"drop it,\" i.e. for- get all about the Levelland event. So what we have is this: it was lightning, but heaven help you people if you talk about it! The problem here, a problem for coverup instigators at least, is (and just about always seems to be) that things had to be quieted down quickly, and that the vision, in the beginning of the coverup process, comes off as being very limited. Did the people who told Clem to keep quiet really think no one would ever talk to his family or friends? The astonishing thing about such coverups is that they essentially always get put together with what one might call truncated logic, i.e. a logic suggesting that one need not think things through beyond a certain point, because the thinking is never going to exceed that point. Coverup artists therefore always seem to think that the quick-fix they put on things is going to last forever. But of course it can't, because unlike purveyors of false- hood, we truth-respecting investigators have all the time in the world to unravel the flimsy logic of coverups hastily assembled. We can follow the reasoning well beyond the artificial limits of truncated logic. That's why \"cold cases\" can so readily become \"hot cases\" again, and often should. The powers-that-be would no doubt have been delighted for a case like Levelland just to die away, forever written off into the la-la-land of the mundanely explainable, but we just can't let that sort of thing happen. Investigators have the advantage Naturally, I tend to cite cases with which I have my own investigative experience, but any coverup cases will do to illustrate the same point. My desire here, though, is to point out that in the final analysis, we UFO investigators have a right to see ourselves and our work in a better light January 2003 MUFON UFO Journal Page?"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"than we sometimes do. The simple fact, but a fact often overlooked, is that we have the advantage. All too often in this field, we seem to see ourselves as always being on the outside looking in. The common per- ception is that there is a highly secret niche someplace, where all the truth lies concealed (this much is essentially true), and we investigators spend our lives moping about the exterior of this secret enclave, forever barred from any glimpse of what lies within. But I would argue that this is not really the case. Could die waiting True, if we wait for the governments of the world to open up and tell us everything, we'll probably die waiting. But our ability to root out the truth for ourselves is im- mensely enhanced by the fact that, as mentioned, we do most certainly have the advantage, and this for at least two reasons. First, as I have pointed out, coverups are typically as- sembled in great haste, and like anything put together in a hurry, their logic will not stand the tests of time and effort. We investigators can and do spend decades exposing all that bad logic. Witnesses come to light, new facts ap- pear, new factual and logical relationships knit together, and the truth peeks through. All it takes is time, and we have time. True, witnesses die and information is lost, but we still have a great deal more time to unravel coverups than their creators spent creating them. Second, coverup artists have to go against the grain, so to speak, in assembling coverups, because to conceal things, one has to suppress and even mangle logic, thereby generating contradictions, non sequiturs, and every kind of poor argument. But those of us who are engaged in ferreting out the truth have the luxury of moving not against the grain but with it, because valid logic in the long run works only for truth-tellers, not for liars. The coverup artist is like the person who buries a body in a shallow grave in the basement and hopes it will never smell. But it will, in time. And for that reason, my hope is that in the field of UFO studies, investigators and researchers are coming to realize that far from being marginalized and excluded from the stream of truth, we are the ones in an advanta- geous position to follow that stream to its source. We have time, truth, and the precepts of solid logic on our side. We will prevail. MUFON shirts and caps Wear official MUFON T-shirts (royal blue print- ing on white cotton), sizes S, M, L & XL.

Lang Type of Report: CEI-Triangular object at close prox- imity Date of Sighting: October 2000-exact date not known- estimated time 10:31 PM CDT Place of Sighting: Plymouth, MN Local Evaluation: CEI-Unexplained The witness is a 79-year-old female, a homemaker and retired bank and mortgage clerk. She indicates that her health and hearing are OK and her vision is correctable to 20/20 using eyeglasses, which she was wearing at the time of the sighting. She describes her education level as a partial college education. She has extensively followed the UFO phenomenon in the last few years and indicates that she may have had a number of psychic and UFOlogical experiences. Sighting Account: The witness was doing some quick household chores on the main floor of her house at about 10:30 PM. She was momentarily standing on her back porch, which is one floor above ground level, facing south- east. She indicates that she often observes the sky, and at this moment, she looked up and observed a large triangu- lar object nearly due south in the sky at an elevation of about 50 degrees or higher. The object moved out of her view, so she ran into her living room, which has a south facing window, and at- tempted to look up at the object. She was unable to see it, due to the overhang of the roof. She thus lost sight of the object at that point. She felt that the total sighting time was under two min- utes [CL estimate: probably less than one minute] Object Description: She describes the object as being MUFON UFO Journal January 2003"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"about six times larger than an aircraft would appear at that location. It moved slowly and silently in an east to west path. She did not know the elevation, and thus could not estimate its size; however, its angular size was larger than that of a garage about 1/2 block away from where she stood [CL estimate: angular size would have been at least that of hand at arm's length]. The object was described as having at least three non-blinking blue lights on each \"wing,\" and one at the apex. The color was described as dark, but not absolute black. The motion of the object was slow, smooth, and silent. Additional Witnesses: None are known. However, the proximity of the witness' location to two major freeways (US Hwy 169 less than 3 miles to the east, and 1-494 to the west) is very noteworthy. It is possible that a signifi- cant number of commuters on these highways could have seen this object. Weather Conditions: Witness describes weather as clear and cool. Detailed weather conditions are not avail- able due to the uncertainty regarding the date. Natural and Manmade Phenomena Check: The con- figuration and blue lighting are not consistent with known aircraft. The witness also describes the motion as being much slower than an aircraft. In addition, any aircraft low enough to have that large an apparent size would have been clearly audible. Additional Note: The description of this object is simi- lar to that of several other \"triangle\" and \"boomerang\" shaped objects observed in the last several years in the Twin Cities Metropolitan area. Consistent themes of these reports are the large size of the object, its slow, smooth movement, and its low altitude. Sighting Evaluation: CE 1, unexplained.

The object was described as moving like an air- plane. However, the description of the object itself was markedly different from any conventional aircraft. The female witness, a teacher, stated that the object appeared to be oval in shape. The entire surface of the object was described as being made up of many red neon light bulbs which gave off a soft glow and appeared to look like a honeycomb. The reddish color was compared to that of a red stoplight, but with no haze around the edges. It had a distinct outline. When first observed, the witness was driving her ve- hicle and facing in a northerly direction. She observed the object through the windshield of her car. As she contin- ued to drive and observe the object, she turned to the southwest and noticed that thin \"extensions\" projected out from the object. There were four \"extensions\" or \"legs,\" according to the witness. They were the same red color as the main body of the object. The object was estimated to be 1/4 to 1/6 the size of a full moon. It was observed for an estimated 4 minutes. It traveled from the north to the southwest and passed over the witness' vehicle during this time. The altitude was judged to be over 500 feet.

Object, 260 feet from witness when first seen (in the west), hovered at treetop height, then moved toward the witness at an estimated 60 mph, coming within 72 feet of the witness. Object then disappeared in the northeast. Object's calculated diameter: 65 feet (average). No sound. Duration: 3-4 seconds. Investigator met with witness, Chris Rock, at his home, Oct. 21, 2000, to take his statement regarding the UFO sighting and later met with him at the location of the sight- ing. Reconstruction of a 2-year-old UFO sighting poses obvious problems for the investigator, but fortunately the witness made a written account of the incident within days of the occurrence and posted the report on his website, rockc@tripod.com. Note also that the witness is an amateur astronomer. At the sighting location, ample points of geographic reference established the distance from witness to object when first and last seen. However, our calculated size of the object, while stated in exact figures, is less certain, and should be regarded as best approximation obtainable. Narrative account At 3 AM (MST) Sept. 15, 1998, witness was working at Westminster College, 1840 So. 1300 E., Salt Lake City. On stepping outside, witness reports the night was cool, around 65 degrees F, visibility clear (no clouds). While facing west, he fired his laser pointer into the sky toward west-southwest in the general direction of Jupiter. Within a minute or two, a gray, spherical object, with an apparent 7\" diameter at arm's length appeared in the western sky, hovering over an adjacent building at a (mea- sured) distance of 260 feet from the witness and 40 feet above the ground. Upon seeing the object, witness turned off the laser pointer. Witness stated he was awed by what he was seeing and doesn't recall feeling or thinking much in the ensuing moments. The object sat motionless for 2 to 3 seconds. The witness states, \"It did not bob or weave. It sat as if it was locked in place. Then in an instant it was moving across the top of the building in front of me. Then it turned to move past me on my right, almost straight over my head.\" The object, which had appeared in the west, moved north, then turned northeast toward the wit- ness at a speed estimated by the witness to be 60 mph. This estimate proved roughly correct. Based on a total distance of 310 feet traveled by the object from initial sighting to when last seen, the calculated speed is 70 mph if the time required was 3 seconds, or 53 mph if 4 sec- onds had elapsed. The witness stated that the object had no evident pe- riod of acceleration; i.e., the object was motionless one instant and then moving at 60 mph the next. The witness watched the object pass over him, heading northeast, then lost it from view as the it passed behind a building. The moment before the sphere moved out of view was when it was closest to the witness: 60 feet away at an altitude of 40 feet. At this point, the witness reports the object had an apparent size of 21\" at arm's length. During these last moments, he observed the underside of the sphere, which he described as \"reddish, pinkish, with pits and pings and very much crater like.\" He added that, apart from the bottom, the object was smooth, gray, and featureless. The witness said he felt the object was aware of him. As the object passed over him, it went behind trees, heading east behind a building. The witness pursued the object on foot, but before he could clear the tree cover he heard a \"bang,\" and when he came into a clearing the object was nowhere to be seen. \"I don't know if the 'bang' sound was related to the object or not,\" the witness stated. He stated that during the sighting no sound was heard coming from the sphere, nor was there any perceptible emission or disturbance to the immediate surroundings attributable to the object. After a couple of days, the witness telephoned Peter Davenport at the National UFO Reporting Center.

It came from a friend of my sister, whom she had not seen since their high school days (mid-1940's). She had returned in 1988 from the Admiralty Islands area, north of Papua, New Guinea, where she had been a missionary for 28 years. The account that follows is in her own words: \"I was on an island called Pityilu, and it was a small, flat, sand island, just a degree and a half south of the equator. It belonged to the Manus Island, to the Manus Province. I was there visiting on this island, where I had church meetings, and the evening meeting, where I had shown filmstrips, was over. \"I was now sitting on the beach, on the north side ... the south-north side of the island, looking over to the mis- sion station where I was working. It was night time, and there was a full moon, and people do not spend much time in their houses-they're little huts-but they love to sit at the beach, especially when the full moon is full. If the mosquitoes are bad, they make little fires from coconut husks, and this way the smoke keeps the mosquitoes away. \"We were sifting there and all of a sudden the people at the western end of the ... now it's a very small island, just a few hundred feet long. And the. people started to shout. And of course if somebody ... there's very little entertainment. There's little excitement; it's the same old thing every single day, and so when somebody shouts, everybody jumps. For example, if there's a feud with a husband and wife, everybody gathers around the house to take part in the feud. \"And so everybody came running... Look! Look! Look! Look! And there, about tree level, not very high, we saw this blimp flying. It had white lights, and then it had some red and some green, and at the very beginning when we first saw it, it was flying in a sort of bizarre way. It was weaving back and forth. And then all of a sudden it straightened out and of course the crowds gathered. \"More and more people-Look! Look! Look! Look! Then it went down the island. It turned at the eastern end, and it landed in the water, which was all reef. It wasn't very deep. And when it landed in the water, the men pulled their canoes into the water to go ... to rescue anyone who needed it. \"But when they got there, there was absolutely no trace whatsoever. If fact, because it was a full moon, people are outdoors, and you could see the splash! You could see, it just... phussssh!\" In the ensuing conversation the following facts came out: 1. It was not the moon itself, as the moon was clearly visible to the right of the object (east). 2. It was clearly visible in the moonlight, and had green and red lights plus white lights that resembled windows, and was relatively close to the observers as it passed from west to east. 3. It had no protrusions such as wings, antenna, bas- kets, copula, or engines, but was merely a blimp-shaped object. This was refined in later conversations to show that the top and bottom were parallel and not curved as a blimp would be, and that there were NO vertical or hori- zontal control surfaces on the object such as on a blimp or zeppelin. This brings up the question of how the course change was made. 4. The specific date was unknown, but was related as \"the late \"70's\", at which time the witness was in good health and wore no corrective lenses. There were no ob- structions during the entire time of viewing, as she was looking towards the horizon over the ocean. 5. The witness' attention was only brought into focus on the object by the natives of the island who had seen it prior to her. (Multiple witnesses-unfortunately, no names). Upon seeing it, she had no idea what it was, and not hav- ing knowledge of UFOs, did not relate this sighting to that phenomenon. Between one to two years later, at a group picnic where another UFO was seen by the assembled people, someone else related that what they were seeing was a UFO, and she realized that what she had seen was a UFO as well. 6. Weather was not a factor, as the night was totally clear. Height of the UFO was given as \"tree level... co- conut tree); therefore it might have been as high as 80 feet above the sea. 7. She was familiar with the area where the UFO en- tered the water, as she had snorkeled in the reef area between the islands many times where the UFO had en- tered the water. The tide was high, and there were no swift currents in the area. The water depth was described by her height in relation to depth. From this we could estimate that the UFO was no more than four to five feet in height. That the UFO had intentionally gone into the water is shown by the fact that it had gone from a hori- zontal plane to an angled descent. 8. In a refinement of a drawing I had made of the approximate shape, she added the oval (changed from the original interview in which I had only given her a choice of circular or rectangular) windows. The red lights were placed above each window, and the green below. However, she wasn't positive if the lights were above and below the windows or in the same position between the windows. However the large amount of indicated lights preclude the idea that these might be interpreted as air- craft position lights. Using the height from item seven above, I used an architect scale to determine the length of the object. She had also drawn a line to shorten my drawing, to show a stubbier craft. Figuring the height to be approximately 4.5 feet, the length comes out to roughly January 2003 MUFON UFO Journal Page 11"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":".•vcaUfrO* -' - Sketch of object observed entering water at Pityilu. 10 feet. My Ford Escort measures 4.5 feet by 13 feet, so we can basically figure that the craft was very close to a compact car in size (not shape). 9. I feel confident that the event as related to me is true, inasmuch as the witness is devoutly religious and has not sought publicity for herself. The story was related as an experience that was awakened by the relationship I had to UFOs, and not by any exuberance in relating a fantastic tale to others. UFOs and water My interest in this case goes beyond the standard UFO sighting, as this one enters the water, with some minor physical trace properties (sound/splash). This might at some time, in conjunction with other cases, point to the operation or purpose of the field surrounding a UFO. As a point of interest I have included a brief summary of four other cases from my file on water UFOs from this very area of the globe. hftp://www.waterufo.net/ (MM-DD-YEAR ). Bold print to show similarities to this case. 08-24-1957. Ninigo Islands-Latitude 1° 16', Longitude 144° 15' £. (west of Manus Island). A patrol officer and four Europeans watched the UFO hover near their ship for 20 minutes. The Acting Director of Native Affairs, Mr. J. K McCarthy, stated that the patrol officer, Mr. E. S. Esdale, was on the Government trawler \"Eros\" when he and the others saw the object. Mr. Esdale reported that he was in the Ahu passage, in the Ninigo Group, when a strange light appeared in the west. \"It assumed the appearance of a large yellow star. It hovered in one place for 20 minutes, but changed from yellow to red, then to green, and finally to crimson. \"It remained still for 20 minutes, then moved violently in a small area. It eventually turned from crimson to green and appeared to enter the sea.\" 04-??-1970 Goodenough Bay, Papua New Guinea. Latitude 9° 50', Longitude 149° 52' E. (south of Manus Island). There were five Papuan crew on board who also wit- nessed the object. A brilliant light appeared beneath the sea on the starboard side, and a huge brilliantly lit object rose slowly from below the water even so it seemed that about three quarters remained sub- merged. Mr. Robins estimates its size to be about 80 ft. in length. Its width and thickness were diffi- cult to estimate because of the sub- mersion, but it was at least four times as long as high (and wide). It was cigar-shaped, with both ends pointed; the top was somewhat flattened. He saw no detail of sur- face, or any irregularities or pro- trusions. The object was self-luminous, dazzlingly bright so that it hurt the eyes to look at it. It was traveling at exactly the same speed as the boat i.e. 7 knots, and paced it for four minutes. Mr. Robins and all the Papuan crew were, needless to say, terrified, and tried to take evasive action by turning to port, but the object did likewise and followed them relentlessly, keep- ing about 20 ft. away from the boat on the starboard beam. They turned two complete circles before shaking it off. The crew were shouting with amazement and fear, but apart from this and the sound of the sea, they heard no sound from the object. The object then suddenly started to descend into the depths until its light faded and it was gone. The sailors immediately turned and made with all speed back to Rabaraba, and did not set out again till after daylight. 08-??-1997 Solomom Islands. Latitude 9° 15', Longitude 160° 00' E. (southeast of Manus Island). According to Dowe, the two men-one of whom claims to be a doctor-wrote that they had been watching a clas- sic UFO over Iron Bottom Sound and in the Visale area of the islands. The UFO had appeared every 2-3 nights over the past two weeks. Local islanders have gone missing, and a number of them have received 3rd degree burns after shining a light at an object passing overhead,\" the men told Dowe. They described the object as about 4 meters across. Sometimes it moves very fast. It has also been seen to disappear in a waterfall, and to travel under water. 01-15-2000 Mekassar Strait, Indonesia Latitude 2° 00', Longitude 117° 30' E. (west of Manus Island & the Ninigo group). He was on a cargo-ship crew that serves the sea lines between Surabaya, Ujung Pandang (Makassar) and the cities in Iran Java (Sorong, Manokwari, Nabire). During the predawn morning of Jan. 15, at about 04:00 AM, he told me that he and his fellow crewmen saw strange shapes of lights from under the sea. At first there's only two of them right in front of the ship. Then suddenly Page 12 MUFON UFO Journal January 2003"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"these two lights move fast toward the ship and stop right beside the ship. One on each side of the ship. As soon as they stop, suddenly many more of these things light-up, just as somebody has turned on the lamps from the bottom of the sea. They were shapeless, just like figures of islands on the maps. These shape of lights were scattered on the area 1.8 km in diameter. The out- side boundary of the area they occupied formed an oval shape. No sounds were heard. And they just stayed there and did absolutely nothing until the ship passed them by. The lights were white, just like a TL lamp, neon lamps. My cousin told me that he never saw anything like it, but his friend did see this thing just one month earlier. The location is nearby, eastward from the first location. His friend was taking a trip toward the city of Manokwari. He saw the same lights under the sea, but in different formation. These ones formed a long line formation just ahead of the boat. When the boat he was in tried to turn back to avoid a crash with these things, suddenly the same lights formed the same formation just behind the boat. The boat was lifted up a bit when it hit these lights. Next thing the boat turned right and escaped from both light formations. Cattle mutilations continue in northern Argentina A veterinarian, Julio Frette, has stated that there have been \"several\" recent mutilation cases in Argentina's northern Missiones Province. \"There were four more cases that were never made known,\" he said, adding that they were not reported due to the ignorance of the parties who made the discoveries, and that the mystery has not been solved. Three weeks after the discovery of a mutilated cow in the vicinity of Concepcion de la Sierra, the veterinarian stated that in fact four similar cases had been recorded in the province's southern reaches, but which were not made known.\" At the town of Apostoles, in the Las Tunas wilderness, a rancher found a mutilated animal and set it on fire. The case which became public occurred on Aug. 8, 2002. On that day, a zebu hybrid cow was found dead, and strange incisions were found on its body in Lot 245 of the Concepciones neighborhood, on a small farm only a few yards from the city limits. The animal, which was about to give birth, had disappeared four days earlier (August 4, 2002) and, according to the report, suffered the mutilation of its internal organs. The absence of the muscles of the left side of the jaw was evident, leaving the maxillary bare of all tissue. The mammary gland was absent. No sign of the calf could be found. -UFO Roundup, Vol. 7, No. 48, Joseph Trainor, editor. Craft, occupants observed on ground by witness MUFON Investigator: Richard Moss The craft was sighted 3/4 mile from Ross, ND, on farm land of the Keith Meiers Family in the fall of 1965. Witness narrative: It was about 11 PM central time. Early fall. Moonlit night. I saw the craft after noticing light reflecting off of it. I then took a rifle with a good scope, set it on the win- dow ledge, and viewed the craft. I could see it had two occupants in flight helmets and wearing military type flight suits. I could see faces through the helmets after I switched to my refractive telescope. They were human, and I presumed most probably mili- tary. The craft was a grayish silver, saucer-shaped, with three supports, i.e. tripod struts. A windshield wrapped partly around the craft in front. It had what I now assume were flight surfaces, but not flaps or such as traditional winged craft use. It sat there for perhaps less than an hour. I was doing something in the room, while I sat on my desk watching it. My eyes got tired viewing through the scope and tele- scope. When I looked up, it was gone. No engine sound or roar. I did go to where I thought the craft had sat, and in rather freshly cultivated field the pads had made imprints about an inch & 1/2 to 2 in. Days later, while driving back roads, we noticed an enclosed wagon setting off the road in a real rural area with an Air Force pick-up sitting be- side it. An airman was standing with an M-16 (AR-15?) on guard. We stopped and began talkingwith him, and eventually with the two others inside, and asked what they were doing. As it had a radar dish on top of the wagon, they replied they were supporting helicopters, while the Minute Man Missiles were being installed. However, perhaps after about 2 hours or so, I asked the first airman about what they were really up to, and told him about the craft I had seen. He said, that's what they were really up to-supporting this new surveillance craft. Newsletters appreciated The MUFON UFO Journal staff appreciates receiv- ing newsletters from local MUFON groups.

Washington State dogs react to UFO BELLINGHAM — On Dec. 8, 2002, the dogs went crazy at about 8:45 PM during an amazing light display on a cold, but clear night. The witness reports, \"I was stand- ing outside watching my husband chopping fire wood when all the dogs of Sudden Valley started howling. I heard a strange loud eerie hum that went low to high then back to low. I asked my husband what was that, and we heard it one more time. \"My husband yelled, 'That's what made the noise!' There was a flash of lights circling a ship that was standing motionless a thousand feet above us. Then it began to move, and the lights on this object flashed different colors. \"A red light that made the shape of a circle seemed to come from the top of the ship, cascading down to the base of the ship showing the true size. It was Huge! Then once the red circle reached the base of the center of the bot- tom of the ship, four lines on each side of the circle in the center of the ship went from the center to the outer part of the ship four on each side. \"The lines of light went from the center to the outside, then lights completed a circle of the outside of the ship. It was an amazing display of a light show that kept repeat- ing the pattern of lights. It was flying south, then in sec- onds it was going west like the shape of an L directly down our street. \"I ran down the road to keep it in sight. I saw the side view, and it was the shape of a huge top hat with a circu- lar base/that was at least 200 feet in diameter.\" Thanks to Peter Davenport NUFORC. Egg-shaped object in California HAYWARD — It was about 4 PM when the witness saw what looked like a planet or star, but it didn't shine like one. On Nov. 19, 2002, he ran into the house and grabbed his binoculars (12x50) and saw an object about the size of a dime at arm's length. It was \"egg shaped\" and had a strange black \"scaf- folding\" structure behind it. The object was pale yellow and was seen for ten minutes. A flash of light appeared below it. An orb-like object streaked to the left at an in- credible speed, and at arm's length it appeared to be the size of a dime. \"I was surprised and moved,\" said the witness, \"trying to show Billy D the object as it streaked away and headed out over the bay.

He says, \"I was observing the meteor shower, and as I was looking up I noticed a large object moving across the night sky from north to south, and the object was five times the size of the moon. It had a line of 8 to 10 lights across it, and also had four lights in a circle on the right side. I lost sight of the object as it went overhead.\" Peter Davenport spoke at length with this witness, and we found him to be quite credible.

I noticed a satellite moving into this area at 5:40 AM, then there appeared two football shaped objects, each with 5 or 6 orange lights traveling north-northwest faster then the satellite, but slower than the meteors. They lasted about 25 seconds. \"Then the one on the left moved directly behind the other and began moving extremely fast and erratic, side to side, forward, and backwards-moves that aircraft could not do.

Officials speculated either a flock of birds or an anomaly caused by high winds resulted in the radar read- ing, which indicated a possible flight violation 18 miles northwest of Reagan National Airport. F-16s maintained a combat air patrol over Washington for at least an hour, and air traffic was halted briefly.

She asked me to look and to my surprise, I also saw what appeared to be a star moving across the sky. \"It was not a shooting star, because it was moving in a horizontal direction. A second star moved towards the first and we noticed several of these star looking objects moving all around. They appeared to stay in pairs. We saw them come to abrupt stops in mid-flight, make right angle turns, and do 360-degree circles. \"They made a full circle in their area and would make a 90-degree turn or shoot straight across the sky. They appeared to be 'dancing' across the sky in pairs except for the lone 'star.'

Possibly about ten. Behind these lights there were several dimmer ones, possibly defining more of the object. \"It looked like there may have been smaller lights around it. It was fairly large, and it was moving east to west just above the tree line. I estimate that it was moving at 200 mph. It was about 200 yards up and l/8th of a mile south of me.

I pulled over, and both myself and my girlfriend looked up in amazement as three objects flashed at a slow rate and moved faster than I had ever seen. At first we thought that they could be fireworks, but they started making a whirring noise not dissimilar to an electricity substation.\" Egg-shaped spheres in Pennsylvania PITTSBURGH — The witness and a friend were do- ing some training for cross country track \"by running a few miles on this abandoned strip-mine near our houses at 4 PM.

Shining light in the UK CONGERSTONE — \"On Dec. 12,2002, the sky was bright over the fields,\" the witness reports. \"We could see the northern lights at 10:56 PM. To our right hovering stationary for 5 to 10 minutes just above trees we saw a shining bright light. It was very difficult to see any shape, because the light was so bright. \"Then it rose slowly and gracefully into the air a few meters away and came overhead, very low and very qui- etly,'gliding above us and disappeared out of view. We ran outside to watch as it went over with its colored blue, red, yellow, and white lights that were fairly dim now. We think it was a diamond shape. A second craft followed its path, but this had a more familiar shape.\" V-shaped object photographed in New York HAMBURG — The witness reports, \"I looked out the window and saw a flashing object that I thought was a plane on Nov. 19, 2002, but it remained stationary for more than 5 minutes. \"I went to the other room and got my digital binocular camera, took pictures at 11:35 PM, and downloaded them to my computer. It was a V-shaped object with multiple colored lights. It remained stationary for about 20 min- utes, then disappeared. It just stopped blinking and disap- peared.\" Thanks to Peter Davenport NUFORC.

It was about two inches long at arm's length, and was pur- est white. It looked like the same object I had spotted in 1998 with my husband on Crosskeys Road. \"Again I was unable to stop, since I had to pick up a friend and take her to the doctor, and she would have missed her appointment if I stopped. Since they are still around I will be looking around the area with my camera equipment more often. I may be able to get some photos or a video.\" Thanks to Evelyn Galson.

We were driving down a hill, thus I happened to see the bottom of it as it descended below the treeline. \"Sue, who saw it for a few seconds longer, said she thought it was moving horizontally and downward, very slowly. There may have been an adequate clearing/field beyond the trees that we saw where it could have landed. It looked too rectangular (sharpish corners) to be a blimp, at least the blimps that I have seen. Absolutely no wings. I'm clear on this. \"Definitely anomalous, but could have been an unusual design of a blimp that is more rectangular than I'm used to seeing. It was definitely not an airplane, nor a conven- tional blimp, and certainly not a helicopter; there were no wings of any kind, nor anything hanging down from it, such as the cabin of a blimp. Had it been a human-built craft, it had to be landing, and quite slowly (far more than any plane could), and it appeared to be going down in an area that was fairly dense with trees. \"We were startled enough by this sight that we pulled off at Exit 30 (Lawnside, NJ) and searched, but were unable, to see it again.\" Thanks to Paul Nahay and Sue Swiatek; full report at http://pnahay.home.sprynet.com/ ufowitne.htm Strange flashes of light in Virginia HAMPTON — The witness reports, \"Early on Dec. 5, 2002, at approximately 3:45 AM, while I was on duty with Security Forces for Langley Air Force Base, myself and another airman witnessed four flashes light up the night sky. It was a type of flash you would associate with a lightning storm. They were very sudden and lit up the whole area. It was raining and hailing, so the weather was very poor. The first flash gave off a bluish glow, the second flash gave off a reddish glow, the third flash ex- hibited a yellowish-orangeish glow, and the final flash was bluish-greenish. These lit up the entire sky and knocked out two city blocks' power. \"We patrolled the area, suspecting it might have been the repercussions of a fallen tree or downed wire. We couldn't find any debris. We notified the Fire Department and the Power Company. We are still unclear as to what was the cause of the power outage.

It was very brief, though.\" Thanks to zenbunny@mac.com Para-Discuss@yahoogroups.com Close encounter in North Carolina MARINE'S CHERRY POINT STATION — John Th- ompson writes, \"Here's a tidbit I gleamed recently from a former North Carolina resident. This man said in the late 1950s, while living not far from the home of the 2nd Ma- rine Air Wing that he had a remarkable close-encounter experience. While playing baseball with high school age friends, someone hit the ball over the roof of his house. He chased the ball and saw a round, disc-shaped craft with platform around it just 'sitting' in the air. \"The craft was 40 feet diameter, and sat motionless and soundless about 100 feet away and about 20 feet high. An opening appeared in the UFO and a humanoid in a skin tight suit and skull cap stepped out onto the plat- form of the object. After only a few seconds the human- oid spotted him and immediately reentered the UFO. \"The saucer then zoomed away. The humanoid stood about five feet three and wore a gray suit. The sighting occurred on a bright, slightly cloudy Sunday afternoon at about 3 PM. He said, the dramatic daylight sighting left such an impression that he can remember what he saw over 40 years ago as if it were only yesterday. \"The unknown object appeared to use colors to mimic its background for camouflage purposes. He says despite being only several miles from the Marine base, he never considered the UFO was a man-made craft because of its seamless construction, zero engine noise, and great speed displayed. The entity, despite its short stature, did have human form. This sounds much like the New Guinea sighting made by a priest (Father Gill) many years ago.\" Thanks to John Thompson. Louisiana reporters see UFO ALEXANDRIA — The witness reports, \"I wanted to let you know that I had a strange sighting on Dec. 6, 2002, just about 15 minutes ago at 2:10 PM, on Interstate 49 and Pineville Expressway interchange in a crystal clear blue sky. A photographer, Douglas Collier, and I were returning from an assignment. I am a reporter for the Alexandria Daily Town Talk. \"Just as we were approaching our exit into downtown Alexandria, I happened to look up and noticed an armada of about 12 military helicopters flying west in formation, most likely heading to nearby Fort Polk. This in itself was an unusual sight, but then something else caught my eye- a cylindrical white-colored object hanging motionless be- yond the group of helicopters. \"I immediately informed Douglas about the object, and I told him to pull over, which he did once we got onto the exit ramp and found a safe place. Unfortunately, he could not get a visual on the object, although I kept pointing at it. I watched it for about three minutes before it began pick- ing up speed and disappearing in the northeastern sky. \"We put in a call to the Rapides Parish Sheriff's Of- fice, but there have been no reports of unusual aerial ac- tivity. The sighting immediately reminded me of that fa- mous videotape from Mexico where the military helicop- ters are flying in formation and a UFO is spotted in the background. \"There was a similar report made in January 2002 where a hunter said he saw a cylindrical or cigar-shaped craft fly over him in rural LaSalle Parish.\" Thanks to Andrew Griffin.

Reviewed by Dwight Connelly This is an enlarged (61 additional pages) edition of the 1994/1998 book of the same title by the same authors. While much of the book in made up of cases from the previous edition, there is sig- nificant new material. The accounts included show that abductions are very much a part of British ufology, and the authors have selected some of the better cases. Perhaps the best is \"The Day Family,\" a 1974 encounter involving three members of one family. This is an account which includes the familiar driving into a \"fog,\" teleportation of the family auto, psychological effects, and details brought out through the use of hyp- nosis. Also of special interest are the four cases (three fe- male, one male) involving sexual encounters with aliens. While there are no earthshaking revelations, these cases do affirm that this type of encounter is occurring with some regularity in the UK. One case, however, seems to be much less than its title, \"The Ultimate Encounter,\" would suggest. It is a single-witness case in which a photo of an alien was al- legedly taken by an English officer of the law (name with- held). Unfortunately, the \"alien\" looks very much like a figment of someone's imagination-dark spots and light spots of natural materials-in the enlargement included in the four-page photo section of the book. Nagaitis and Mantle do show that they are credible researchers by including this enlargement, which is much more revealing (and damaging to the witness) than the smaller original photo (also included). Not only is the photo unimpressive, but the story of shooting this key picture, then going into town and shooting some more photos be- cause the witness \"had felt guilty about wasting so much film\" also sounds far-fetched. It seems more likely that a general scenery shot in- cluded the shape of what could-through considerable imagination-be construed as a figure, and that the dis- covery of this pattern in one of the photos initiated the idea for an unlikely story. (At least this \"alien\" didn't kill a dog and end up in a freezer.) Overall, Without Consent utilizes cases that are gen- erally accepted by mainstream ufologists in the UK. This updated edition is certainly well worth reading, and it would make a nice addition to anyone's ufological library. Awakening by Mary Rodwell, 2002, Beyond Pub- lications/Fortune Books Ltd, Sycamore House, Park Road, Leed LS15 9AJ, UK, 5x7 softcover, 301 pages, £9.99 Reviewed by Dwight Connelly This is primarily a book for experiencers-those who feel they have had contact with extraterrestrials-although individuals who are simply interested in the abduction phe- nomenon will also find it in- teresting. For those not sure of pos- sible contact, a comprehen- sive questionnaire is provided to indicate the likelihood of past abductions (physical effects, dreams and flash- backs, psychology and be- liefs, intuitive feelings, para- normal experiences, fears and phobias). The author even asks three questions about reactions to the ques- tionnaire itself which may reveal experience with past abductions. I should note that the au- thor prefers not to use the term \"abductee,\" since she feels that some of those experiencing such contact do so willingly, preferring the term \"experiencer.\" Mrs. Rodwell was a nurse, mid-wife, and health edu- cator in the UK. She migrated to Australia in 1991, and has worked as a counselor in both a medical practice and two professional counseling agencies. She has had a pri- vate counseling practice for the past nine years, as well as serving as a hypnotherapist, metaphysical teacher, in- tuitive healer, and writer. She says she first became involved with experiencers when counseling a young man who came to her because he felt he had a strange problem, and she had the reputa- tion of being a counselor with an open mind. This first case involving a possible abduction led Mrs. Rodwell to work with numerous other experiencers as time went by. (She notes that she has not personally had an experience with extraterrestrials.) \"My research suggests,\" she says, \"that the classic forms of contact published in the popular media reflect only a small percentage of those who have had contact experiences. More recently I have formed the conclu- sion that greater numbers of people may well have had a more gentle and subtle form of contact, and because these experiences are not as confronting or traumatic, they are less known.\" However, she adds, \"Whether the experiences them- selves have been traumatic or of the more subtle kind, the January 2003 MUFON UFO Journal Page 17"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"ultimate effects are usually the same-that contact is trig- ger for change....an awakening of the individual to a multidimensional awareness, showing them new human potential that is absolutely extraordinary.\" Hence the title of the book. The author covers all aspects of the abduction phe- nomenon, including the controversial topic of implants and their possible purposes. (Interestingly, Dr. Roger Leir, the top authority on implants, wrote the Forward of this book.) The chapter I found most interesting, however, dealt with The Missing Pregnancy Syndrome. Perhaps because of her nursing background, Mrs. Rodwell has presented the best material I have seen on the disappearing fetus controversy. She explains the usual medical explanations for a miss- ing fetus-blighted ovum, spontaneous abortion, missed abortion, hydatidiform mole, secondary amenorrhoea, and pseudocyesis-and discusses why these may not suffi- ciently explain all cases. She reports that some women have had disturbing dreams and flashbacks following the loss of the fetus, and discusses how one woman described, under hypnosis, the taking of her unborn baby boy by what appeared to be extraterrestrial beings. Some of the anomalies connected with pregnancies include: •Pregnancies experienced by women who have riot had sexual activity. •Women who have never had a pregnancy have been told by their doctors that they have scar tissue on their reproductive organs. •Positive pregnancies end with little or no evidence of a fetus, followed by memory of something being taken. •Strong emotions on the part of some women that they have had a child on a spacecraft; sometimes this is con- firmed by other children who seem to have an awareness of them. •Women who have visual images of their children who look \"not quite human,\" but who seem to have bonded with them. •Contact experiences which correspond with the woman's ovulation periods. •Dreams of being secured to a table and having the fetus removed. •Women seeing rows of containers with fetuses in them. •Unexplained emotional trauma, similar to Post Trau- matic Stress Disorder (PTSD) after an abortion, despite the fact'that there was no known abortion. Mrs. Rodwell provides a list of nine indicators \"that may suggest contact pregnancy, as well as suggestions for coping with the grief and feeling of loss experienced with the missing pregnancy syndrome. The author moves into even more controversial and unresearched territory in her chapter on \"Star Children,\" described as individuals allegedly carrying alien genes which make them better physical and mental specimens. This is an interesting book, and where the author relies on her own experience, it is informative. When she ven- tures into other areas it should be read with caution. Allies of Humanity: Virgil Staff replies In the Forum of the November, 2002 issue of the MUFONJournal, Ron Stadskley has acquainted us with his dismay at my review in the same journal of May, 2001, of the Allies of Humanity (www.alliesofhumanity.org). It is always good to hear from MUFON state section directors, since these must take much of the credit for the high quality of MUFON investigations. But I cannot be disheartened at his failure to acqui- esce in the Allies materials, since the author, Marshall Vian Summers, affirms that these not only are not for everyone, but they will not be accepted by most. In paragraph three, Stadskley tells us there are nu- merous channelers out there with various versions of the extraterrestrials. This may well be true, but I cannot verify it, since I normally do not peruse channeled materials. I have no knowledge of their views. Nor is his affirmation relevant. So his statement that I accept the Allies and \"dismiss all the others\" requires rethinking. I do not acknowledge them because I do not know what they say. Moreover, I do not accept the Allies with the same relevancy that I would accept, by definition, that 2 + 2 = 4. I look at the Allies materials as the most consequential statements I know in the field of serious ufology. I am prepared to change my mind at any time, but up to now, I have not sensed any reason to do so. As a lad, I became interested in UFOs back in 1947. Since that time, I have read most any book that seemed to seriously consider the subject. I joined NICAP, APRO, and MUFON about 1978. Paul Cerny, the state director, loaded me down with dozens of investigations, since in Northern California he had difficulty in locating investi- gators who would actually do the investigative footwork. Over the years I have come to know dozens of abductees, many of whom have come to be close friends of the family. Some of these feel they have become bet- ter people as a result of their contacts, whereas others have been decimated. Over the years, my chief burden, if that it can be termed, has been .the perplexity of what was the intent of the Visitors. At this time, I continue to be uncertain, but the Allies of Humanity volume has made more sense to me than anything else I have ever read. The Allies is a po- tent statement of intent, and most of the readers I have spoken with seem to feel similarly. This will not be mean- ingful to Mr. Stadskley, but it is my current gut feeling concerning a subject for which there is so little so-called scientific proof In paragraph nine, Stadskley apparently finds difficulty in recognizing that the so-called \"allies\" providing us with information may not be akin to physically interfering with our lives. In paragraph ten, he poses a question that is (Continued on page 22) Page 18 MUFON UFO Journal January 2003"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"View from Britain By Jenny Randies Jennv Randies Taken away As I write, the BBC in Britain is soon to show the Spielberg TV mini series \"Taken,\" and interest is already brewing. It will be fascinating to see how the media react to this fictional treatment of the alien abduction phenom- enon, although I am not expecting any sophisticated treat- ment to occur. However, as the screening in January, 2003, coincides with the 25th anniversary of the first time that I interviewed a British abductee and ob- served her being hypnotically regressed, it has offered me an opportunity to look back over that quarter century to see if we have learnt anything about what is going on. Days at night That first case had occurred in October, 1974, and involved a family called the Days, who were driving home from a family outing through rural Essex when the close encounter struck. The children were dozing in the back seat and were never regressed as they were rightly too young for that, but they did have some dreams of seeing strange creatures that fitted the recall of their parents. Although both adults were regressed by a team of in- vestigators led by Andy Collins and Barry King, I wit- nessed only the wife, Sue, under hypnosis that chilly win- ter day in 1978. It was a weird experience for many dif- ferent reasons-not the least that I was left in no doubt that she and her husband had genuinely undergone some kind of extraordinary episode for which there was no obvious rational explanation. They were not publicity seekers. Nor were they any- thing other than an ordinary young couple. In fact, this family was like so many others that I was to meet over the years-and a million miles from the kooks and crack- pots that the mass media so casually seek to imply al- ways \"see\" things when reporting such matters. The Days had encountered a strange bank of green mist into which their car was driven. Then there was a jump in reality and electrical effects on the car radio. Next thing they knew there was a bump (as if they hit the road violently) and they were further along their journey. Only when they switched on the TV at home to watch a program they were rushing back to view did it become evident that the program had ended and a large chunk of time had disappeared. This, of course, is a familiar story to UFOlogists these days, but in 1978 it was very new to me-certainly first hand-and carried more impact because I had not read it a thousand times in the tabloid press or seen endless TV shows about it. The Days had struggled with this weird experience for three years before sharing it with UFOlogists, and only bits and pieces of recall had by then come out through dreams. The hypnosis that I witnessed was an eerie thing, not only because I listened to a mother and housewife relate events way beyond her comprehension and like a scene out of the soon to be released Close Encounters of the Third Kind, but also because as I talked to her whilst she was under regression she started to \"channel,\" as we would now'call it, the alien that had abducted her! I was totally unprepared for this-literally having a one- to-one with ET in her living room! As I made the long train journey home I was trying to figure out what had just happened. I did not actually think that I had just talked to an alien. I was not entirely sure what I had done, in truth, but the most logical assumption was that I had some- how been in contact with a part of Sue's mind that was emulating an alien in some way. But how had that occurred? And, of course, I knew that this was supposition. I could no more prove it was the truth than that I could say that I really had just had a conversation with an alien entity. To say that it threw into total confusion how I should interpret the abduction evi- dence is an understatement. And all from this very first case. Lessons learned Perhaps how one evaluates such extraordinary evi- dence is bound to be shaped by the kind of data that we individually encounter. A witness to such an event, who would know that they were not making this up, would inevitably be drawn towards full acceptance as some sort of literal reality. A skeptic, schooled in science, and coming to meet actual witnesses only after the skeptic has already de- cided that alien contact simply cannot be happening, would inevitably view what they saw in terms of preconceived theories. That is why, I suspect, so little effort has been made by skeptics to investigate real witnesses, and in- stead into coercing imaginary experiences or testing out rational ways by which hallucinations might occur. It is easy to do that if you know that these things must be hallucinatory in the first place. And meeting witnesses or doing research with them tends to be counter produc- tive for skeptics because it has the annoying habit of prov- ing such folk sane and unpresupposing. Not at all like the skeptic's theory might decree. As for me, when I came January 2003 MUFON UFO Journal Page 19"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"upon this case I had no real idea what to expect, so was more or less forced to take the evidence on board, what- ever it was, learn the lessons that it taught, and try to define answers from that starting point-rather than come up with evidence to fit answers that I already had. Hopefully that has allowed me to look at these things more objectively, because I have no vested interest in proving these things real or unreal-no neat theory (be it ET visitation or fantasy prone hallucinations) into which I must slot everything. I can afford to accept all the clues that pour out of the evidence and work with that. Clues Clues there are in great numbers. What these clues all mean is quite another matter, of course, but I think you have a better chance of sporting them if it genuinely does not matter to you what the ultimate answer may be.That is because some clues support the physical reality of these events whereas others seemingly do not. Indeed the evidence at times contradicts itself so much that it is a disadvantage to have some kind of theory in mind. Whatever lhat theory is may cause you to uncon- sciously dismiss some of these clues because they do not fit. For instance, the fact that witnesses have an apparent continuity of experience within many cases-whereby the abduction is a part of a lifetime of psychic experiences (from apparitions to poltegeist attacks)-is to me a vital bit of data. It supports a witness-centric type of explanation: that there is something about the people who experience these things that is different from others who do not. Matching this is the observation of what I call the Oz Factor-that witnesses during these close encounters seem to enter a kind of alternate reality where the rules of time and space as we normally experience them simply change. Again this suggests that to experience the abduction requires the person to be in some kind of special state of consciousness. It is another witness-centric observation. Yet there is evidence that this phenomenon is not merely visionary in nature. I have investigated a number of abductions where there is clear evidence of some physi- cal reality behind the experience. The electrical effects on the Days' car were caused by no hallucination. Real energy was behind that. I have lost count of the cases where the signs of some physical energy field are apparent-from witness hair stand- ing on end as if attracted by an electrostatic charge through the important little keys to cases that hoaxers could not know well enough to invent (one involves the signs of paralysis effects on the brain). Then there are the physical effects on the environ- ment which tend to be extremely consistently reported. Moreover, there are cases where secondary witnesses have observed the abduction in part. That is, whilst the alien contact experience tends to be personal and local- ized, I have met enough secondary witnesses to know for sure that something was really out there. They saw a light or dome shape in the same location as where the abduction occurred. They support independently the pres- ence of an anomaly at the location where an abduction is reported to take place. These secondary witnesses do not prove that the ab- duction was a literal alien kidnap, but they certainly es- tablish to any objective thinker that it was not merely an imaginary experience caused by nothing more than tired- ness or a fantasy prone personality. If these things are factors that is all that they are-pieces of the jigsaw not the full picture. Towards illumination Twenty-five years on and I am still looking for answers. That is why UFOlogy is such a fascinating challenge. If I could merely accept that it was all in the mind, as so many skeptics glibly do (and thereby miss out on much that ought to intrigue science) then I would be happy. But the evi- dence simply does not allow you to do that. Equally, if I could accept that all of this means that the witness stories are literally true and aliens are invading us, then I would be darned worried, but at the same time quietly satisfied that this riddle was solved. Sadly, it is not to me as easy as all that, because you cannot dismiss the evidence that seems to point towards a witness-centric basis to these cases. Indeed, for me, alien abductions are more fascinating than ever because they are not so simple to reduce to this neat either/or resolution. Last fall, as I reported in an earlier column, I spent some time investigating strange phenomena on an island off the British coast called the Isle of Man. It is an ex- traordinary place-home to the oldest democracy in the world (a parliament founded by the Vikings over 1000 years ago), and possibly the one part of Europe still im- mersed within Celtic folklore to such an extent that there is a widespread recent history of encounters with mer- maids, strange beings that cut crop circles, and an assort- ment of other entities that will strike many chords with any alert investigator. What fascinates me about this kingdom is that whilst there are some interesting UFO sightings here (including an almost Roswell-esque \"crash\" {wo years ago), there do not seem to be any abductions. However, there are cases very like abductions. Indeed until very recently, in terms that echo Steven Spielberg, the local children in one part of the island were afraid to go out at night in case they \"got took.\" This was the term they used to describe the experi- ence whereby people would lose track of themselves, wander off onto the moors, their sense of time and space would alter, they would see some weird beings, and then find themselves somewhere else without realising how they had gotten there. This all sounds rather familiar, doesn't it? But these experiences have never been reported in the context of UFOs or aliens. Rather they are part of a continuum of evidence traced back hundreds of years in which a race of beings known to islanders as \"themselves\" was con- sidered responsible. I wonder if there simply is not the need yet to update the way in which this encounter is interpreted to take account of space age needs.

Friedman Flatwoods Monster UFO event Frank Feschino's telephone call cameras a surprise this past summer. We had met at two Florida conferences a few years back and he had mentioned he was research- ing the Flatwoods Monster UFO event of Sept. 12,1952. Our pictures were taken together, and that was about the end of it. Now Frank, a trained illustrator with a Film and Video degree as well, was ask- ing if I would help him out by at- tending the Flatwoods Monster 50 th Anniversary event in Flatwoods, WV, the weekend of Sept. 12. There were more conversa- tions and I agreed as long as they would cover expenses. 1 hadn't been in West Virginia for years, though I had spoken at West Vir- ginia University in Morgantown. Frank wanted me to speak on two afternoons at the newly set up \"museum\" or event center and do some media interviews. I did Stanton T. Friedman some homework, reviewing what had been written about the case by Jerome Clark, Donald Keyhoe, Dr. Joe Nickell, and others. Some was impressive. The plan was to drive to Bangor, ME, fly to Cincinnati, and then to Charleston, WV. Frank would pick me up with the mayor and drive the 60 miles onlhterstate 79 to a motel in Sutton, next door to Flatwoods. That morning was jinxed. I got on the connecting flight in Cincinnati with a few other passengers. Then we were told to get off, just a small problem with the plane and they were bringing over another aircraft. While waiting, there was a major Security Alert and we were all chased out of Terminal A. With all my travel- ling, this was my first such security adventure. I spent a few hours waiting in line, then finally getting through security to find that the plane had left and I was booked on a much later flight and wait listed for'a some- what earlier flight. I tried calling Frank, who was of course at the airport in Charleston. I was the last standby let on the flight. Frank was waiting with the Flatwoods mayor. They hadn't been able to get any useful info from the airline, but somebody who got off my supposed flight said things were a mess. Fortunately, we did arrive in time to lead a tour of people who had come for the event to the actual site of the encounter with the monster. Frank led the tour on the old Fisher farm as we walked past the remains of the once 50-foot plus tall oak tree, which the monster came from behind. Only about a ten- foot section of the massive oak that had stood there in 1952 was left. We walked up to the top of the huge hill located in back of the farm where the UFO had landed. We then overlooked the nearby gully where the UFO mi- grated to, and then proceeded back down the path to the tree. Exactly 50 years to the minute after the event. Knowing the geography was very useful. Since that place at the top was the highest flat and cleared area in the region, it was the logical place for an aircraft in trouble to land. In the gully the UFO was not exposed. These areas were well above the school yard where the young- sters had been playing football when they first spotted the object. I helped Frank on the tour, even noting that a month or two before, while on a radio show out of NY, a former USAF man then based at Andrews AFB had called say- ing that not only were there jets scrambled over Wash- ington, DC, during the famous July,1952, flap of sightings, but frequently for the following year, which would include the time of the Flatwoods case. I spoke without slides both days in the small museum meeting room which had been decorated with Frank's photos and drawings. I did several interviews and met with several witnesses, including Mrs. May, the key wit- ness, and both of her sons who were there and who had also been witnesses. It turned out that the mayor had also seen the object fly over. The \"Monster\" had come from behind the tree. The branch under which it had passed was a little more than 12 feet above the ground. The monster was hovering about a foot off the ground and barely cleared the branch (thus being about 12 feet high), giving off some kind of oily substance which stained clothes of some of the wit- nesses and whose smell made some of the boys quite ill. It was clear that the monster was not too much like the drawing which had been spread around after being made by an artist for the We the People TV show on which Mrs. May, Eugene Lemon, and the local story-breaking reporter appeared exactly one week after the event. It was much more mechanical and had antennas instead of hands. We heard for the first time a tape that had been made many years earlier of a show hosted by Long John Nebel, the old New York City talk show host who often dealt with UFOs. Nebel interviewed naturalist Ivan Sanderson in depth. Sanderson had gone to WV and talked to many witnesses within a short time of the event. Gray Barker of Clarksburg, WV, had also interviewed witnesses soon after the event. The local reporter, Mr. Stewart, had interviewed many witnesses and was aware of other sightings in the area that same weekend. I was truly amazed at how much effort Frank had put into his investigation. He found news clippings from all over the East Coast talking of UFOs and supposed mete- ors seen that weekend, though more likely burning or January 2003 MUFON UFO Journal Page 21"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"plasma surrounded UFOs. There are NO meteor show- ers during the month of September. Frank dug out the Blue Book files which had been dif- ficult to read. He managed to locate the head of the Na- tional Guard contingent who was at the site within hours of the event, having been instructed by the military to check it out. Col. Leavitt was with a bunch of troops who spent over night at the site. He managed to get samples of the oily material, which were sent off, never to be heard from again. Frank, be- cause of his film school training, videotaped extended in- terviews with many of the key people, including both Col. Leavitt and journalist Stewart. Of course there are some who say the whole story was bologna, with the kids making up stories to get atten- tion, and the so-called monster being nothing more than a large barn owl because of the way the top of the monster (seemingly a protective helmet) was shown as being backed by something in the shape of a playing card spade. Naturally, in the tradition of noisy negativists, these de- bunkers did their research by proclamation rather than investigation. The loudest of the debunkers is Dr. Joe Nickell, the chief investigator for the self-anointed Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal. Dr. Nickell does have three degrees (all in English), did visit Flatwoods, and writes well. However, he did not talk to the witnesses, and did not visit the site hillside, the tree, or the flat area at the top. He has a long, very misleading article in Ron Story's 2000 Encyclopedia. It was just scared youngsters see- ing a barn owl and a meteor landing on the hill. A ten-foot high owl would really have been something, especially one able to float without moving its wings and without a branch to sit on. For a large glowing meteor to land with- out making a sonic boom (loud explosive sound) and not leaving any meteorite residue would be truly remarkable- especially when it had to change direction and slowly move across town. Frank Feschino has done most of his work very qui- etly, and has been almost obsessive about secrecy. I feel particularly privileged to be able to read a copy of his manuscript about the case. I surely hope that a publisher will soon be found, and that a motion picture production company is not far behind. Based on his drawings and comments made by report- ers within three days of the events, and on testimony by other witnesses from a nearby town where a \"monster\" was also seen, I think that at least the exterior portion of the monster was mechanical. It made me think of a haz- ardous material protective device, perhaps with an Extra- terrestrial Biological Entity inside. It seems clear the object was in trouble when it landed. There is far more evidence relating to the Flatwoods Monster case than was the case with regard to that other West Virginia monster, the Mothman. Although Frank Feschino has already collected a huge number of clippings about the case I would be most happy to receive any that readers can dig up from any newspa- pers for Sept. 12-16, 1952. They may refer to UFOs or Page 22 MUFON UFO Journal meteors or missing jets seen east of the Mississippi, and can be sent to me at FOB 958, Houlton, ME 04730 USA. Please indicate the date of the clipping and the name of the newspaper. I will forward them to Frank. The best website to check out is Frank Feschino's at www.flatwoodsmonster.com . MUFON Forum: Staff replies... (Continued from page 18) clearly answered in the Marshall Summers materials, so I must presume Stadskley did not read with much care. Finally, the New Knowledge Library, which comple- ments the Allies of Humanity, is said to prepare one for the time when the multitude actually come to realize that the Aliens are with us. The stated purpose of these semi- nal books is to prepare us to live our lives with equanimity, when the great mass are living theirs in fear and despera- tion. I believe that, in a small way, this is already happening with myself, my wife, and some of my friends, and it does not interest me greatly that all the individual mysteries of ufology, or of anything else, have not been explicitly ex- plained. It may be that, at times, the methodology must be compromised. Stadskley is rightfully concerned about the factor of self-validation. My own understanding of the scientific method is that even with what might be understood in scientific propositions and argument, the factor of self-validation must always be present. For this must be the basis of personal gut feeling and acceptance. Without the sense of self-validation, one will accept most any material because it is believed various others believe similarly. But I do not consider this a sufficient justification for the basis of a belief-system. Stadskley undoubtedly conjectures that he is being sci- entific. But there is a marked difference between scien- tific method and scientists' approach to various subjects. In the field of ufology, the mass of scientists have shown themselves to be conventionalists. They have been a drag on progress. In Steps, Marshall Summers writes: \"Since nothing can really replace Knowledge, the desire to serve that which replaces Knowledge is the desire to serve nothing, to be nothing, and to have nothing. This is what we mean when we speak of poverty. It is a state of serving nothing, being nothing, and having nothing.\" In all kindness, I can only hope that Mr. Stadskley will read further. -Virgil Staff Ozark UFO Conference set for April 11-13 The 2003 Ozark UFO Conference hosted by Lou Parish is set for April 11-13 at the Inn of the Ozarks, Eureka Springs, AR.

Strange light and triangle observed in Georgia MUFON Georgia (MUFONGA) has a source of in- formation \"from a really sharp, intelligent, and observant female resident whose father is a 3 3-year veteran airline pilot, and her husband a veteran Marine,\" says Georgia State Director Tom Sheets. This witness indicated that shortly after 6 AM on Dec. 2, 2002, when she went onto her porch to feed her cats she noticed a stationary blinking light above/through the pine trees across her street, where no blinking light should have been. She observed more closely and found it to be similar to a beacon light, and she timed the flashes to about every eight seconds. She added that it appeared to be like a light on top of one of the satellite antennas, but no such array exists in that area. She later described it to her husband, who told her of his experience during the same time frame. He arrived at his work location, which is about ten miles from home, about 6 AM that morning. He and a couple of his associates were outside and observed some sort of triangular-appearing craft silently \"zip\" across the sky. It was just beginning to get light outside, with only tree outlines visible. The flying triangle had one light in the center and may have been about the size of baseball at arm's length.

Schuessler MUFON International Director MUFON Headquarters re-opens I am pleased to announce that most of the damage done to the front of the MUFON Headquarters facility by a drunk driver on Nov. 7 has been repaired. Unfortu- nately, the front was boarded-up for a full month awaiting new doors and window frames to be built. As a result, many folks that wanted to visit the facility were unable to do so. Nevertheless, workers installed the new doors, frames and windows on Dec. 9. It took another week to get the walls rebuilt and painted. Carpeting took a bit longer. The good news is that we started the new year with a freshly opened and fully-functional building. Sightings increase For the past several months we have seen a steady in- crease in the quantity and qual- ity of UFO reports. The large chevron and triangle-shaped objects and disks continue to be reported on a regular basis, r , _ , , while spherical and egg-shaped John Schuessler reports have increased significantly. More of the inci- dents are multiple-witness events, and close encounters are the norm. Lights in the sky are reported less fre- quently now. The chore now is to get our field investigators out into the field quickly to fully investigate and document these incidents. State directors are busy coordinating and over- seeing the investigations. One step is to get the investigation results back into the WUFOD database and the original report mailed to MUFON Headquarters. Another is to prepare a narra- tive that can be published in the MUFON UFO Journal so the results of the work can be shared with the whole membership. New Field Investigators Kathleen Marden, Director for Field Investigator Training, has announced that the following Field Investi- gator Trainees have completed the Field Investigator's Exam and are now MUFON Field Investigators: Tom Bowden, Gresham, OR; Patti E. Caffrey, Winchendon, MA; Mark D. Hunziker, Marina del Rey, CA; Diane L. Johnson, Granada Hills, CA; James M. Kurdyla, Cranford, NJ; Don Nellesen, Clarkesville, GA; David Paulides, Los Gatos, CA; Kane Wilke, Bremerton, WA; and Ronald Wilson, Lansing, MI. Congratulations to this large class of graduating field investigators. We know they are ready and willing to tackle some of the new incidents now being reported. Field Investigator Trainees are urged to study the MUFON Field Investigator s Manual and take the exam. The manual is available from MUFON Headquarters for $25 plus $3.50 p&h in the U.S. Add $4.00 for orders shipped outside the United States. The exam is also avail- able from MUFON Headquarters. It is mailed free to trainees when they have completed their studies. Position Announcements Wayne Gracey, State Director for Pennsylvania, ap- pointed Jennifer Stein to the position of State Section Director for the counties of Bucks, Montgomery, and Philadelphia. Tom Sheets, State Director for Georgia, appointed Don Nellesen to the position of Assistant State Direc- tor for northeast Georgia. Call for Cover Art Work Plans are coming along nicely for the 2003 MUFON International UFO Symposium in Dearborn, Michigan, July 4-6, 2003. Speakers are working on their papers for presentation at the event, and design of the annual sym- posium proceedings book is underway. As always, we give MUFON artists an opportunity to design the cover for the book. If you would like to have your artwork considered for publication on the cover of the 2003 book, your submission must be received at MUFON Headquarters by March 1, 2003. That will al- low us to make a final selection and have the book ready for the printer on April 1, 2003.
