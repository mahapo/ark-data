Rojcewicz, Ph.D. Dr. Rojcewicz is a professor of humanities at the Julliard School in New York. The following article is reprinted with the permission of the editors of Folklore Forum, the University of Indiana, Blooming- ton, where it originally appeared. INTRODUCTION Most studies of UFOs have con- fused their structural and phenome- nological nature due to inadequacies inherent in both the definition and classification of the subject matter. The acronym \"UFO\" in popular usage means \"flying saucer,\" that is, a hardware product of an extraterres- trial technology. This reduction of the UFO question to the study of only \"flying saucers\" has negative effects upon the study of belief materials with regards to 1) definition, which determines our academic levels of involvement and the formulation of research priorities; 2) taxonomy, since our classification systems define the anatomy of the subject matter at hand; 3) epistemology, because encount- ers with nonordinary entities raise the issue of the nature and means of knowledge and \"knowability\"; and 4) ontology, around which revolves the question of socially discovering alter- nate realities through various cultural experiences and modes of being. Current definitions and taxonomies do not display an appreciation for the complex interrelatedness of \"flying saucers\" with numerous folk belief traditions. A hypothesis that sees \"fly- ing saucers\" on a continuum with numerous other cultural manifesta- tions is offered here as an alternative to the conventional exclusionist's argu- ment that \"flying saucers\" are com- pletely discrete and self-contained. The continuum hypothesis provides a viable explanation of the occurrence of a specified group of human encount- MUFON UFO JOURNAL, No. 243, July 1988 ers with the extraordinary. This pro- position, based on substantial ethno- graphic data, is asserted as a provision- al conjecture (working hypothesis) to guide investigations in the area of folk beliefs. PROBLEMS OF DEFINITION The term \"flying saucer\" did not come to hold its present position in popular usage until after the June 24, 1947 sighting of nine discs over Mt. Rainier, Washington, by pilot Ken- neth Arnold of Boise, Idaho. A prob- lem of terminology developed when numerous reports of other-than-disc- shaped phenomena were likewise termed \"flying saucers.\" The military preferred the term \"Unidentified Fly- ing Object,\" UFO (pronounced Yoo- foe), to distinguish reports which sounded to them more like fairy tales from those reports which they believed to be reliable. Thus the key terms used to distinguish among uncertain aerial phenomena possessed an eva- luative and qualitative nature rather than serving an accurate taxonomic function. A major obstacle involved in secur- ing adequate definitions of unorthodox phenomena like UFOs stems from the failure of the present terms to discriminate between descriptions and interpretations of events. For exam- ple, each word of the term \"Unidenti- fied Flying Object\" contains an inher- ent confusion. \"Unidentified\" simply contains too broad a spectrum of possible phenomena, and thus it is too vague. \"Flying\" is also proble- matic because of its mechanistic con- notation. We do not describe all aerial phenomena as \"flying\"; clouds and stars are not rightly said to \"fly.\" \"Object\" begs the question, assuming what needs verification from case to case. Douglas Price-Williams (1974:224) maintains that in the term \"Unidenti- fied Flying Object\" we find an assump- tion disguised as a description. In the case of the equally unsatisfying term \"flying saucer\" we have an explana- tion disguised as a description. In addition to the confusion of terms discussed above there is an even greater challenge to accurate definition and taxonomy. A formal morphology indicating the primary, invariable features of the UFO expe- rience eludes us at this time. As a result, there exists no precise defini- tion that absolutely distinguishes UFOs from other phenomena and which assures the credibility of data embraced within the conceptual boundaries of the term. This imprecision under- mines the effectiveness of our taxon- omies which seek to establish order among the data by grouping together features shared by members of the same class of experience. The most influential and most widely utilized classification system for UFOs was created by a Professor of Astronomy at Northwestern Uni- versity, the late J. Allen Hynek (1974:31-32, 98-99). Hynek's typology includes 1) noctural lights in the sky; 2) daytime discs; 3) radar visual reports; 4) Close Encounters with space-craft or their occupants. 1 . This schema has worked well for the obvious physical manifestations of UFOs, but it does not address the important issue of psychological and paranormal features (Schwarz 1980: 184-286, 400; Vallee 1975:6), nor the complex and plentiful descriptive and phenomenological connections among the above mentioned categories and related folklore traditions (Vallee 1969; Rojcewicz 1984), a weakness that the continuum hypothesis is intended to correct. Although people have different things in mind when they use the terms \"Unidentified Flying Object\" or \"flying saucer,\" we can nevertheless assume that these terms do communicate something significant. This same prob-"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"1cm of definition can be observed in other disciplines with reference to their major subject matter. Physicists have not defined the elusive proper- ties of the atom, yet few deny its descriptive validity. Biologists have not defined the cell nor geneticists the gene. Anthropology has never agreed upon a definition of \"primi- tive\" (Diamond 1974:118). This same difficulty finds another analogue in folklore itself, wherein neither the discipline as a whole nor a single one of its genres have yet to be satisfactorily defined (Dundes 1980:21; Degh 1983:38-39). This is hot to say that some invariable features do not exist, but only that Ufologists and folklorists alike have yet to discover them. It may be that in the case of UFOs the definitive components of the phenomena lie not in their per- ceivable anatomy, but in what they express, or how and why they occur. 2 EXTRAORDINARY ENCOUNTER CONTINUUM In order to more fully understand the nature of the full spectrum of human confrontation with anomalous entities, the operative term \"Extraor- dinary Encounter Continuum\" is offered here. These entities can be referred to as \"nonordinary,\" \"unorthodox,\" \"nonconventional,\" or \"supernatural\" insofar as they: 1) demonstrate spon- taneous activity; 2) demonstrate the ability to produce images independent of sense perception, and 3) demon- strate complete control over these images (Jung 1958:66-67); 4) repres- ent an actual order qualitatively dif- ferent from our everyday world which 5) interacts with our material world in complex ways. 6) Belief in such enti- ties is cross-cultural. Enumeratively defined, the Extraor- dinary Encounter Continuum refers to human confrontation with the anomalous, whether in the form of \"beings\" (e.g. extraterrestrials, fairies, monsters, etc.), \"entities\" (e.g. appa- ritions, energy forms, tulpas, etc.), \"objects\" (e.g. spacecraft, vimanas, fiery shields and crosses, etc.), or unusual light(s). The term \"flying saucers\" is but one descriptive and interpretive frame people employ after confrontations with a particular kind 4 of nonordinary entity along the Extra- ordinary Encounter Continuum of experience. Encounters with the ano- malous can occur as an abduction, out-of-body travel (OBE), near-death experience (NDE), shamanic journey, or combination of two or more of these forms. No individual encounter category is more important in itself than another. The predominance of atten- tion given in this article to UFOs is arbitrary and could easily be focused upon any other category of the continuum. All the traditions along the Extraor- dinary Encounter Continuum are dis- crete but related. They are separate but not separated, like an individual's relationship to a hand. Although the traditions can be distinguished from each other, they nevertheless display similar complex patterns of appear- ance and activity. The continuum hypothesis maintains that to more fully understand the complex nature of nonordinary events, one must see them in relation to the larger context of human encounters with unorthodox entities. All phenomena along the encounter continuum share at least a borderline, as do a ship's bottom with the water, the ocean with the waves, and the waves with the sky overhead. This hypothesis argues that some belief traditions are so closely related phenomenologically as to warrant inclusion under the umbrella term \"Extraordinary Encounter Continuum.\" GOALS OF HYPOTHESIS The continuum hypothesis is intend- ed to accomplish the following: 1) account for the cross-cultural distri- bution of extraordinary beliefs, espe- cially in modern times when official agencies debunk UFOs, spiritual enti- ties, and nonordinary realms, predict their demise, and relegate such beliefs to the arena of pseudoscience; 2) allow comparison of a great variety of apparently diverse and unrelated local belief systems in order to permit meaningful generalizations and syn- theses; 3) predict and explain the nature of unorthodox belief in ways that are empirically confirmable, logi- cally consistent and pertinent to other fields of scholarly inquiry; and 4) produce an operative definition that more accurately reflects the nature of nonordinary experiences. This propo- sition is offered here since no hypothe- sis currently accomplishes all four of these functions simultaneously, although some accomplish one or two (Keel 1976; Vallee 1969; Steiger 1976). RELATIONSHIP OF DEFINITION TO TRADITION AND EXPERIENCE The encounter with nonconven- tional beings often involves pheno- mena, experiences, motifs, and beliefs which are thought in tradition to belong in separate categories but which sometimes occur together simul- taneously in actual experiences. This conjunction of anomalous factors can take the form of a \"spirit guide\" or \"etheric master\" possessing an extra- terrestrial connection (Rojcewicz 1985), an encounter with a mysterious globe of light during a supernatural assault of the classic nightmare (Hufford 1982:49, 217), or a UFO abduction during an out-of-body experience (Clark 1980:199). Reasons for the belief in the confluence of two or more belief traditions may include: 1) They are related in the culture's body of traditional belief. 2) They are so similar phenomeno- logically that they are connected by the percipients' interpretations of their experiences, even though this con- nection does not occur simultane- ously in the same experience nor in tradition. 3) They occur together simultane- ously in the same event independent of tradition, or close enough in time and space from the percipients' point of view as to constitute the same event. An example of the first case listed above can be seen in the Middle Ages when a number of late medieval writers fueled the belief that fairies and elves were \"either devils or dia- bolical illusions.\" This hostility toward the fairies was supported by the Reformation, whose writers argued that fairies could only be good or evil, with the latter the more likely possi- bility. The official doctrine of most Protestant teachers of the time was that it was useless to attempt to dis- tinguish good fairies from bad since the Devil was behind them all (Tho- MUFON UFO JOURNAL, No. 243, July 1988"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"mas 1971:610). The usual academic response to accounts that link the fairies to the devil is \"Those events took place — or seemed to take place — because you hold that belief.\" Similarly, it has been argued (Lowe 1979: 69, 71) that UFO legends dis- play a continuity of described fea- tures because \"the narrators are drawing from a common language\" and otherwise \"share a frame of ref- erence which enables them to appropri- ately set up similar narrative struc- tures combining similar contents.\" David Hufford (1985:119) refers to this conventional academic position as the \"cultural source hypothesis.\" This perspective maintains that des- criptive continuities among accounts of extraordinary encounters are always generated from a common tradition rath- er than a formally consistent experience. An incident from the UFO abduc- tion experience of Betty Andreasson indicates how one's interpretation of an event can lead to the apparent involvement of two or more belief traditions. Under hypnosis Betty des- cribed and drew pictures of her alien captors. These creatures had large pear-shaped heads, grey clay-like skin, and hands with three thick fingers. Their mongoloid-looking faces had large wraparound catlike eyes, holes for noses and ears, and fixed scarlike mouths. Despite the fact that Betty verbally described and drew pictures of entities that are clearly consistent with the appearance of alleged extra- terrestrial beings as found in numer- ous UFO accounts, her interpretation of her experience led her to believe that her abductors were \"angels\" (Fowler 1980:13). We can clearly see here the fusion between experience and belief, des- cription and interpretation. Betty's Christian beliefs color her interpreta- tion of the appearance of her abduc- tors, calling them \"angels,\" despite her verbal and pictorial descriptions to the contrary. This is most likely an example of the \"reflective principle\" in operation, although it is possible that description of appearance alone is a necessary but not sufficient fac- tor in determining whether any two or more belief traditions intersect in the same experience. MUFON UFO JOURNAL, No. 243, July 1988 THE REFLECTIVE PRINCIPLE Proponents of the \"reflective prin- ciple\" argue that a percipient's per- sonal and culture-bound values signif- icantly shape their nonordinary experi- ence. The coloring of experience by a percipient's psychology or cultural beliefs does not invalidate the poten- tial reality of the event; it merely complicates it. A familiarity with the generic conventions of accounts of human encounters with the super- natural in general, and the specific folk belief tradition in particular, should reveal pressure-points, as well as values, within the generic frame. A psychological profile of the informants should indicate how much of their community's belief traditions are mir- rored in their individual accounts. Cognizant of the framing structure and conventions of the witnesses and, if the account has made its way into print, the conventions of thought and style of the popular or academic author(s), we can measure the poten- tial for individual variation and elabo- ration. Measuring personal or cultural reflectivity allows the phenomenology to come through. The reflective principle often plays a role in how a witness identifies and interprets a nonconventional expe- rience, but it does not always do so. Some good data now exist indicating that people completely unaware of a traditional body of beliefs undergo recognizable anomalous experiences (Hufford 1982:15; Moody 1976:123-24). Michaej Elliot, conducting initial research on \"flying saucers\" in 1980, never heard or read about the eso- teric UFO tradition of the \"Men in Black\" (MIB) when he encountered an MIB in a library in Philadelphia (Rojcewicz 1987). Encounters with manifestations of the Virgin Mary are not limited to Roman Catholics, Greek Orthodox, or Coptics. J. Gordon Melton (1980:316), a Methodist minis- ter and Director of the Institute for the Study of American Religion in Evanston, Illinois, admits to having a Marian sighting. Ramakrishna, founder of the Vedanta Society, has likewise testified to having had a similar vision. Witnesses to anomalies like UFOs often find that their experien- ces contradict rather than mirror their values and beliefs, and yet they still insist upon the validity of the events (Hall 1974: 215-216). Just as traditional understandings can influence descriptions and interpreta- tions of one's experience, so also the repeated encounters with nonordi- nary entities can influence a body of traditional beliefs. From this perspec- tive, people hold particular beliefs because certain extraordinary events take place. Proposing that experience influences tradition at least as often as tradition influences people's inter- pretations of their experiences, the continuum hypothesis can account for and predict belief in the presence of two or more folk belief traditions in the same experience. Most present belief-related definitions and classifica- tion systems have not led investiga- tors to appreciate the complex con- nections among folk traditions. Before examining some of these important continuities, a statement about method- ology is needed. METHODOLOGY The Extraordinary Encounter Con- tinuum represents the full spectrum of human interactions with anomal- ous phenomena through time and space. It is, first, a descriptive phe- nomenology which systematically organ- izes parallels between human encoun- ters with nonordinary beings regarding such features as their appearance, powers, and effects; and second, a hermeneutical method drawing upon salient ideas from several disciplines and relying primarily on cultural and historical data, proposing specific pat- terns to better explain the nature of inexplicable encounters. Neither method, it must be stressed, necessitates the researchers' acceptance of all infor- mants' accounts as true, but it does presuppose a refusal to reject a priori their potential validity. An important theoretical assump- tion of the continuum hypothesis inherent in both the phenomenologi- cal and hermeneutical methods is that not all reports of anomalous encounters are products of hysterics, hoaxes, or perceptual and mental impairment. UFO abductees, for exam- ple, attend school to some degree (Lorenzens 1977:155). These abduc- 5"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"tees tend to be policemen, business- men, schoolteachers, and other respect- able citizens (Hynek 1974: 34). Recent studies of unorthodox phenomena such as supernatural assaults of the classic nightmare (Hufford 1982) and near-death experiences (Moody 1976; Greely 1975) indicate that a signifi- cant percentage of traditional super- natural belief is associated with accu- rate observation analyzed rationally. RECURRING TRAITS An examination of the Betty Andreas- son UFO abduction experience reveals significant connections among several folk belief traditions. The Andreasson affair displays continuities among \"fly- ing saucers,\" near-death experiences, out-of-body experiences, and shamanic journeys. This case offers good evi- dence that two or more traditional systems of unorthodox belief occur simultaneously in experience. The key feature of the Andreasson expe- rience from the continuum perspec- tive is her confrontation with extraor- dinary beings. It is this encounter with the anomalous, whether in the form of beings, entities, objects, or unusual lights, that is the invariable feature inherent in all the discrete belief traditions of the past and pres- ent comprising the Extraordinary En- counter Continuum. Despite wide variation in the cir- cumstances surrounding a person's encounter with the extraordinary and in the kind of people undergoing them, there are nevertheless striking similarities among the reports of the experiences themselves (Lowe 1979: 67-79). These continuities are so sig- nificant that one can easily pick out ten elements which appear again and again in published and unpublished accounts of \"flying saucers\" and their occupants, near-death and out-of- body experiences, and shamanic jour- neys. ENCOUNTER EXPERIENCE • Feelings of friendliness, love, fear- lessness. • Being Chosen: \"mission\" motif. • Instruction / Enlightenment. • Passing through material objects. • Beings of light / Unusual lights. 6 • Journeys to nonordinary realms. • Tunnels / Enclosures / Paths and borders / Limits. • (Nearly) Ineffable. • Revelatory moments. • Psychic manifestations. Only four of the above listed traits will be explored in this article. The remaining features will be developed in a future publication. Bright or Unusual Lights and Borders and Limits: Like many UFO witnesses, Betty Andreasson, her father Waino Aho, and her daughter, Becky, saw a peculiar pulsating light shine through their kitchen window immediately before the aliens walked literally through the kitchen door. Transcripts of the hyp- nosis session indicate that Betty said: \"I can see a light, sort of pink now. And now the light is getting brighter. It's reddish orange, and it's pulsating ...\" (Fowler 1980:3). The single feature that Betty recalls most vividly about her abduction experience is light. Betty associated the aliens and their spacecraft with a luminescent light, a common descrip- tive motif not only of \"flying saucers,\" but also of fairies and fairy boats, the aerial cars of the Mahabarata called \"vimanas,\" and numerous other enti- ties in folk belief traditions (Rojcewicz 1984: 421-39). Betty also experienced light in a more mystical manner. While she underwent physical examination at the hands of her captors — a com- mon feature of UFO accounts — Betty was told: \"We are going to measure you for light ... You have not understood the word you have ... You are not completely filled with light.\" (Fowler 1980:44). Betty interpreted \"light\" to mean the light of spiritual grace and faith, that is, the presence of God within her: \"I believe I am filled with the light! I believe — I believe that I'm filled with the light\" (Fowler 1980:44). The light motif is ever present in accounts of out-of-body travel, near- death encounters, and shamanism. During an out-of-body experience, Robert Monroe (1977:24) reported that he witnessed \"A ring of sparks about two feet in diameter,\" with the axis of his body as the center of the ring. On another occasion, as Mon- roe (1977:23) prepared to induce \"astral travel,\" a \"beam or ray seemed to come out of the sky\" and struck him, a motif not uncommon to UFO accounts. This warm light caused Monroe to vibrate violently. He became \"utterly powerless to move\" as if \"being held in a vise.\" It is interesting that Ken- neth Ring (1980) has found \"Seeing the Light\" and \"Entering the Light\" to be two of the five fundamental ele- ments of a close encounter with death. The Ojibway shaman called the \"tcisaki\" hears voices of the manitou spirit and sees light sparks within the ceremonial shaking tent. \"Hearing voices and seeing bright lights are traditional signs of a vision- ary experience among the Ojibway\" (Grim 1983:155). Light is a key ele- ment of religious and mystical expe- riences in general. JOURNEYS TO NONORDINARY REALMS Humans abducted or invited by extraterrestrials to visit distant planets usually travel by \"flying saucer.\" However, when Betty Andreasson obeyed a command to stand directly behind one of the entities, she found herself \"floating\" several inches above the ground with a \"rolling motion\" that matched the movements of her captors as they traveled in a single file. As she approached the space- craft, Betty noticed odd sensations throughout her body: \"My hands and my legs are asleep or something ... I feel weightless. Oh my feet are pins and needles or something — even my arms and my hands. (Fowler 1980:27). This \"pins and needles\"sensation has often been described by mystics, mediums, and visionaries. Betty spoke of a force that held her body rigidly in check: \"They seem to have con- trolled my body somehow so I'm fixed in place\" (Fowler 1980:30). Robert Monroe (1977:24) has pub- lished personal accounts of this same catalepsy with its accompanying vibra- tions. It seems reasonable to claim that Betty Andreasson traveled out of her physical body, an experience sometimes referred to as \"astral travel.\" Betty constantly complained that her body was \"weightless,\" but MUFON UFO JOURNAL, No. 243, July 1988"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"\"rigid,\" pulsing with \"vibrations.\" Betty Andreasson, it seems likely, described two bodies: her physical and her astral. Sylvan Muldoon and Hereward Car- rington (1970: 50-51) have described in full the characteristics of the cor- poreal and etheric bodies, and their findings support the claim that Betty left her physical body. The rigidness of Betty's physical body finds a paral- lel in the following statement from a case reported by Celia Green in Out of the Body Experiences: \"... then I was back in bed, but I couldn't move hand or foot, my scalp prickled, start- ing at the top of the head and the prickling sensation spread all over me ...\" (1968:61) The words \"enstatic\" and \"ecstatic\" are helpful in describing the Ojibway shaman's cognitive condition that facili- tates his dangerous soul journey to the ghostly underworld, according to John A. Grimm: \"Ecstatic describes that type of trance in which the sha- man's consciousness is said to leave the body. Enstatic applies to that inspired state in which the contact with the sacred is decidedly interior and meditative.\" (1983:144) The con- tinual beating of the shaman's drum effects the shaman's passage to the numinous world. Peculiar noises and the sensation of floating have been otherwise noted by Raymond A. Moody (1976: 37-38). People who have \"died\" report having traveled through a tunnel, enclosure, void, or cylinder before contacting souls of the dead. Betty Andreasson herself floated through a cylinder or tube: \"It looks like a silvery tube ... slowly lowering down. We are going down.\" (Fowler 1980:34) Moody (1976:70) found that people who have \"died\" have described what could be called a border or limit in the form of a body of water, a gray mist, a door, a fence across a field, or simply a line. Similarly, Betty Andreas- son told Raymond Fowler how UFO occupants took her to the \"Green Realm,\" a sunless land or island of fog and mist. This place was inha- bited by lemur-like creatures (i.e. the living dead) and contained a pyramid with crystal walkways and bridges over water. When Fowler asked Betty if she had actually left the MUFON UFO JOURNAL, No. 243, July 1988 Earth, Betty replied: \"I believe we were in space, and somehow we were in the center of the earth (sic). Now how can that be?\" (1980:80). Betty's account of her journey to the myste- rious \"Green Realm\" touches upon several traditional folklore motifs such as \"Wonder Voyages\" (F 101.1) and \"Rivers in the Otherworld\" (F 161.2). Could Betty Andreasson have under- gone a near-death experience while abducted by extraterrestrials despite not having \"died\"? Moody (1976: 67- 69) acquired two accounts of near- death experiences in which no clinical death actually took place but real psychological stress or injury existed. Betty had been under severe stress for several years. Her marriage to James was problematic from the start and eventually ended in divorce. James' severe car crash and subsequent hospitalization forced Betty into the demanding role of breadwinner while she cared for her elderly father and six children. Despite being physically worn, Betty travelled several hours to hypnosis sessions which she hoped would unlock the mystery of the UFO encounter. Faced with cases as complex as the Andreasson affair it seems likely that no absolute criteria exist by which one can precisely clas- sify every experience as OBE, NDE, or UFO abduction. There will always be borderline cases. This is the raison d'etre of the continuum hypothesis. REVELATORY EXPERIENCE To conclude the discussion of the four selected features that appear with great frequency among accounts of \"flying saucers,\" OBEs, NDEs, and shamanic journeys, let us now turn to an examination of the lasting life impression that such encounters have upon many percipients. Betty Andreasson believes that her abductors \"awakened\" something in her when they touched her forehead during the physical examination they conducted upon her. Like the sha- mans of many cultures, Betty had her own revelatory visions. \"It was as if the infinite opened up on me ... I was seeing inventions so far advanced — thousands of years advanced — and yet it seemed just a scratch in the infinite.\" (Fowler 1980:186) Betty Andreasson's confrontation with the aliens, particularly her inter- action with her two \"teachers,\" \"Quazgaa\" and \"Joohop,\" seemed to have a stabilizing effect upon her vol- atile emotional condition. It has been argued elsewhere that Betty's abduc- tion experience served as a useful \"tool\" facilitating her mental and emotional competency (Rojcewicz 1984: 640-670). Shamans also undergo personality adjustment or reorganiza- tion resulting from their encounters with guardian spirits and animal pow- ers of a transcendent reality. Both the shaman and the patient receive a new identity through the healing pro- cess. Sometimes this experience occurs to non-shamans after undergoing a visionary quest for the purpose of receiving a guardian spirit power, or it may occur after a serious illness as among the North and South Ameri- can Indians, as well as the natives of Siberia. \"Such a radically profound and revelatory experience often encour- ages the individual to take up the way of the shaman\" (Harner 1982:63). People who have lived through close encounters with death have stated that they subsequently feel their lives deepened, their perspec- tives expanded. They are more reflec- tive and interested in issues of a phi- losophical nature. Life contains much for them to learn. One informant told Moody (1976:83): \"I felt like I aged overnight after this happened, because it opened up a whole new world for me that I never knew could possibly exist.\" The most common character- istics of revelatory experiences are a sudden transformation of the percip- ients' personality and experience- ordering systems (Hufford 1983:311; Steiger 1982:148). While many of these personality and life transformations are positive, many are not. John A. Keel has observed from his fieldwork that: \"The Illumination experience changes their lives, but it has no effect on the world. In many instances people are changed for the worse instead of the better, just as the majority of all supernatural manifestations are harm- ful or at least senseless.\" (1975:20) Whether we can agree or not with Keel that a majority of all supernatu- ral manifestations are harmful or sen-"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"seless to the percipients, he has nevertheless documented cases of emotional collapse and mental dis- order (1976:229). According to mysti- cal tradition, whether a confrontation with nonordinary realities is harmful or not depends largely upon skilled guidance and appropriate prepara- tions (Hufford 1985:109). FUTURE RESEARCH Alvin Lawson (1980:230-31) believes that \"It is likely that dreams, halluci- nations, death experiences and a var- iety of other phenomena are related to UFO experiences.\" He employs the term \"encounter matrix\" to refer to the \"extensive similarities between UFO encounters and religious and metaphysical mysticism, folklore, sha- mans' trances, migraine attacks, and even the operation of creative imagina- tion.\" Berthold E. Schwarz, M.D., (1983) has conducted pioneer work explor- ing the extraordinary ability of Stella Lancing of Massachusetts to take random photos wherein unidentified globes, and rays of light can be seen, as well as the whole spectrum of psy- chiatric and psychic UFO-related con- ditions and events. David Hufford (1982:234) has pointed out continui- ties between UFOs and accounts of vampirism, witchcraft, and the classic nightmare. Keel (1975:60) and Steiger (1976:39) have suggested that the same unknown mechanism behind UFOs gives rise to all mystical and religious experiences. Robert S. Ellwood (1973:131) sees a very close connec- tion between UFO cults and Ameri- can Spiritualism. J. Gordon Melton (1980: 314) has argued that strong continuities exist between UFO expe- riences and encounters with appari- tions of the Virgin Mary. Future studies examining the links between \"flying saucers\" and their occupants with apparitions, spiritual- ist and theosophic claims, mystical ecstatic occurrences, shamanism, the classic nightmare (Old Hag), OBEs, NDEs, and other anomalies would be a tremendous help in further under- standing the varied unorthodox ways people gain knowledge and access to alternate realities. There is good evi- dence to suggest that encounter 8 experiences between human and non- human entities are fundamentally cog- nitive (Hufford 1985:94) or \"noetic,\" to use William James' term, and not simply or always an emotional or \"oceanic feeling\" (Freud 1961:11). CONCLUSION Arguing here for the relatedness among various folk traditions that compose the Extraordinary Encoun- ter Continuum should not be inter- preted merely as a search for func- tional equivalents. It would be unsup- portable to claim, for example, that an OBE is simply a UFO abduction of another name. Such a conclusion would be dangerous since the impor- tant differences between the two phenomena would be unjustifiably lost. In addition, it has not been argued here that because these folk traditions are related they are indica- tors of an objectively real order that can only be extraterrestrial. It should be quite clear, however, that extraor- dinary encounter reports are signifi- cant, not only for the study of folk belief, but also for studies of the acquisition of knowledge and the delimitation of realities. This article is part of an ongoing attempt to develop a coherent hypothe- sis of folk belief that neither rejects a priori reports of anomalous experien- ces simply because they lack strict scientific verification, nor embellishes them in order to prove that the supernatural realm exists. The conti- nuum hypothesis insists that investi- gation of the alleged objective reality behind beliefs in nonordinary events is an important function of the belief- oriented folklorist, despite some scho- larly opinion to the contrary (Degh 1977:244; Ward 1977:216, 218). It may well, prove that phenomena along the Extraordinary Encounter Continuum are not scientific prob- lems but authentic experiential mani- festations. This fact would not neces- sarily invalidate the significance of these extraordinary events and may instead point to the boundaries of orthodox scientific procedure and scope. 3 In either case, a general considera- tion of the overall encounter conti- nuum should prove the best approach to date for defining accurately the anatomy of various as yet inexplica- ble phenomena like UFOs, as well as for the construction of reliable belief taxonomies. It must be understood, however, that the operative term \"Extraordinary Encounter Continuum\" serves primarily as an explanatory context for investigation and not yet as the definitive description of con- frontations with the unknown.

Hynek's UFO typology includes three kinds of \"Close Encounters.\" A Close Encoun- ter of the First Kind (CE I) is a \"close-at-hand experience without tangible physical effects.\" In a CE II \"measurable physical effects on the land and on animate and inanimate objects are reported.\" In a CE III \"animated entities (often called 'humanoids,' 'occupants,' or sometimes 'Ufonauts') have been reported.\" Although it was not a part of Hynek's original typology, the UFO abduction experience has come to be referred to as the CE IV. 2. John F. Szwed, writing specifically about folksong, has conjectured that \"It may be that the irreducible minimum in folklore is social structure, where the roles and statuses of a community are restated in one or another form as a basis for comment, whether humorous, tragic, or ironic. The community, after all, is the setting in which a song emerges, in which it is performed, and in which its meaning unfolds.\" (1970). 3. The Society for Scientific Exploration, Peter A. Sturrock, Ph.D., The Institute for Plasma Research, Stanford University, Presi- dent, was formed in April, 1982, with 100 founding members drawn primarily from uni- versity faculties in the United States. The pur- pose of the society is to provide a context for intelligent examination of anomalous pheno- mena and related topics. The society defines \"anomalous\" as any phenomenon which appears to violate existing scientific understanding or is generally regarded by the scientific community as lying outside their established parameters of investigation.

Ware, Florida State Director, Charles D. Flannigan, Lead Investigator and Walter H. Andrus, Jr., International Director Copyrighted by the Mutual UFO Network, Inc. (MUFON) 1988 The series of articles published in the March, April, May and June 1988 issues of the MUFON UFO Journal under the above heading have carried a disclaimer stating MUFON's posi- tion with respect to this controversial case. As we have said, we are break- ing a precedent by inviting our read- ers to join the team of field investiga- tors via the pages of the Journal in their search for evidence and answers to the incredible photographic case that may be classified as a CE I, CE II, CE III and now a CE IV case. If this case is exposed as a grand MUFON UFO JOURNAL, No. 243, July 1988 hoax, Journal readers will be the first to know. Up until this time it was considered to constitute either one of the most incredible cases in UFO his- tory or a most fantastically orches- trated hoax, one that would challenge the production skills of Steven Spiel- berg to duplicate. If the reader had access to the CUFOS Bulletin dated April 1988, it stated, \"The Gulf Breeze photographs taken by Mr. X are most probably a hoax.\" It also stated that \"CUFOS expects this statement to be both the first and last one we make on Gulf Breeze. Ufolo- gists have better things to do with their valuable time and resources than spend endless hours listening to tales of UFO visitations from Mr. X.\" After passing two polygraph tests on February 18 and 23, 1988, CUFOS's Scientific Director and Investigator Coordinator publicly insulted the wit- ness by saying, \"It is well known that sociopathic personalities can pass lie detector tests even when telling false- hoods. CUFOS does not put much stock in the results of any lie detector test.\" Mark Rodeghier, president and scien-"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"tific director and Jerome Clark, IUR editor were not content with the CUFOS Bulletin's \"first and last state- ment,\" but devoted extensive cover- age to the Gulf Breeze Case in the March/April 1988 Volume 13, Number 2 of the International UFO Reporter along with artwork on pages 13 and 24 relating the object photographed to hoax cases. It would not be in good taste to debate each item of the misinformation published in Jerome Clark's editorial titled, \"111 Breeze\" or Mark Rodeghier's article \"Gulf Breeze: A Note to the Committed,\" even though both consisted of public ridic- ule of the MUFON investigative team's work on this case. These gentlemen simply joined the crowd of \"armchair ufologists\" who injected themselves into the case without having the facts. Even before the April CUFOS Bulle- tin was mailed, Mark Rodeghier and Jerome Clark were contacted by tel- ephone or letter and advised by Budd Hopkins, Dr. Bruce Maccabee, and Walt Andrus, that a hoax announce- ment was premature because the investigation was still being conducted and the photographs analyzed. CUFOS leadership apparently had more faith and confidence in the misinformation being fed to them in Chicago by Robert D. Boyd, their Investigator Coordinator in Mobile, Alabama, than in the advice of Hopkins, Maccabee, and Andrus who personally went to Gulf Breeze to investigate the inci- dent. Mark Rodeghier had the good judgment to place considerable confi- dence in the results of Dr. Bruce Maccabee's photographic analysis, how- ever, he became overzealous and did not wait for the factual evidence and the analysis to be completed. On Saturday evening, June 25, 1988 at the MUFON 1988 Interna- tional UFO Symposium in Lincoln, Nebraska, Walt Andrus presented a slide-illustrated lecture on the Gulf Breeze Case in conjunction with Dr. Bruce S. Maccabee, who provided a photo analysis, addressing discrepan- cies in some photos pointed out by skeptics, various methods of hoaxing a UFO photograph, actual measure- ments of the craft and distances from the camera. He demonstrated to Ed and Charles Flannigan how a double 10 exposure could be taken with Ed's 14-year-old Polaroid. Analysis was provided on the photographs taken with the NIMSLO 3-D camera supp- lied by Tom Deuley of San Antonio and the self-referencing stereo camera composed of dual Polaroid Sun 600 LMS cameras on a boom and mount suggested by Dr. Maccabee and built by Ed. Preliminary computer enhance- ment was demonstrated via slides on a few of the questionable photos to eliminate skeptics' accusations. Obviously, Dr. Maccabee had spent hundreds of hours in his thorough study of the case and photographs. He is a world renowned UFO photo analyst. Dr. Robert Nathan of J.P.L. in Pasadena, California, the inventor of computer photo enhancement, did not perform an analysis of the photo- graphs, but relied on the results of Bruce. After seeing and hearing Dr. Mac- cabee's in-depth presentation, the majority of the audience was con- vinced that the Gulf Breeze Event was a very strong case and definitely not a hoax. For a detailed account of Dr. Maccabee's presentation, please refer to the MUFON 1988 Interna- tional UFO Symposium Proceedings for his paper titled \"A History of the Gulf Breeze, Florida Sighting Events,\" pages 113 through 204. Dr. Maccabee literally demolished the objections and accusations of a host of skeptical \"armchair ufologists\" with documented evidence, photo analysis and physical measurements. During the question and answer period on Sunday afternoon, Jerome Clark was asked \"what he thought of the Gulf Breeze Case now?\" His brief answer was \"interesting\". Since sev- eral of the CUFOS officers attended the symposium, semi-private meetings were held by Donald Ware with Jerome Clark, Donald Schmitt and Nancy Conrad to answer questions on Sunday morning. Sunday evening Walt Andrus met with Donald Schmitt and George Eberhart to provide fac- tual information, since they had unwit- tingly accepted the distorted informa- tion supplied by Robert D. Boyd. Both Don and George seemed shocked by the revelations of the truth, since they had been \"taken-in\" by Bob Boyd's prejudiced and biased report- ing. Obviously, they were embar- rassed for the premature article in the CUFOS Bulletin and the Interna- tional UFO Reporter. Your MUFON Director was also very disappointed in the tactics employ- ed by Mr. Boyd, since I initially invited him to join the Gulf Breeze investigative team as the CUFOS Investigator Coordinator and our new State Director for Alabama, as a cooperative action between MUFON and CUFOS. (His report, \"The Other Side of the Coin,\" to CUFOS and a select group of investigators familiar with the case was in direct contradic- tion to good investigative practices, procedures, and policies.) The charges that Ed was a hoaxer were dispelled when he and his wife Frances attended the symposium incog- nito and volunteered to submit to a barrage of questions and answers privately at the MUFON Board of Directors Meeting. Ed and Frances were open, frank, and sincere in their answers concerning their community relations as a businessman and both as civic leaders. They were reluctant to meet with CUFOS personnel due to the lies that Bob Boyd had written about them and the inflammatory articles in the CUFOS publications. This is certainly understandable. The CUFOS leadership will undoubt- edly go back to the drawing board and ask themselves many questions. Why did Mark Rodeghier listen to Bob Boyd and disregard the advice of Maccabee, Hopkins, and Andrus? Regardless of whether this case had been a hoax or conversely, a strong and very significant UFO event, many lessons have been learned from the experience which should influence future investigations. It is sad that CUFOS as a scientific UFO organiza- tion did not apply scientific investiga- tion principles and research instead of relying on historical patterns to prematurely declare that the case was a probable hoax. As Mr. Ed has proclaimed — \"The truth will prevail.\" It now appears that the CUFOS leadership has accepted the fact that this is indeed a very significant UFO case and deserves further in-depth study. The MUFON investigator's team will continue to be available for this purpose. It is our prayer and MUFON UFO JOURNAL, No. 243, July 1988"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"hope that a reconciliation of philo- sophy will be reinstated between CUFOS and MUFON. The Gulf Breeze investigation will continue with professional hypnosis sessions to help reveal what hap- pened to Ed and several other people in the immediate locale who have had unusual experiences. He wasn't the only person to view entities in north- western Florida and southeast Ala- bama. Don Ware and his very com- petent team of investigators can now concentrate on the numerous other cases that have been reported to them since last November, since it appears that the stereo photographs made by Ed in Shoreline Park on May 1st marked the end of his fami- ly's traumatic and terrifying experien- ces. (Nothing further has happened to Ed, Frances, or their children as of July 6, 1988.) More detailed information on the events surrounding his May 1st pho- tographs will be published as Part V in the August 1988 issue of the MUFON UFO Journal. As we origi- nally promised, the readers of the MUFON Journal will be the first to know the ultimate decision on the Gulf Breeze UFO event. Yes, it is one of the most significant cases in UFO history and you read it here first. Stay tuned! Circular Evidence Between May 8 and August 29, 1987 no less than 63 circles and two individual rings were found in fields across Southern England. As if this number were not enough, during the same period I also received reports that the same kind of phenomena was appearing in France and Australia. Our team of investigating engineers and scientists, including a member of the British Parliament and a retired British diplomat, are quite confident that the cause of these mysterious compressions are not meteorological, nor are they hoaxes of any kind. The extensive data now gathered at our base in Andover, Hampshire indicates some form of intelligence is involved, probably working in tandem with the magnetic field around our planet and could be an aerial entity of some kind. A number of equally intriguing occurrences have been experienced not only by our team but also by members of the public close to these sites. Two of them are referred to in the following extracts from a book called Circular Evidence which it is hoped will be published shortly in Great Britain by Souvenir Press. The book is co-authored by myself, an electrical engineer and Mr. Pat Del- gado, a retired N.A.S.A. engineer. BRATTON -1987 You can see in Plate 1 (cover) the only double-ringed circle known to us. The team is carrying out the investigation inside the circle. Both MUFON UFO JOURNAL, No. 243, July 1988 By Colin Andrews Article and Photographs Subject to Copyright ©1987 rings can be clearly seen with the hill behind rising up to Bratton Castle. An event which occurred a few min- utes after this photograph was taken could be significant and will be referred to later. This huge 30.28 meter diameter formation was one of many to appear in the area on August 8, 1987. The large 16.3 meter diameter circle con- sisted of flattened wheat plants, swirled around in a tight 2.25 revolution \"Catherine Wheel\" pattern. The plants were not as firmly pressed to the ground as many we had seen before. The inner ring was one meter wide, varying by a few centimeters in pla- ces. The wheat had been pushed down with similar pressure swirled anti-clockwise. The outer ring was slightly wider but this time the plants were pushed down clockwise. The standing walls surrounding the forma- tion were as upright as ever, appar- ently totally unaffected by the event. Weather data supplied by the Brit- ish Meteorological Office was checked for the possible time of arrival of the formation and again drew a blank. The wind direction varied from 280° to 270° and mean speed from 6.3 knots to 9.3 knots over the period. August 8 was overcast with only 0.1 hours sunshine and a temperature maximum of 16.9 C. Rainfall showed a trace. The high hill nearby was to the south of this field and consequently ruled out formation by some new unknown kind of weather vortices forming in the lea of a hill. The Wingfield family who had read about the circles in The Times that day were above the White Horse when they spotted this circle and our team below the Bratton Castle escarp- ment on which they were standing. George Wingfield, his wife and two young sons walked down the steep hillside towards the edge of the field in which were the circle and two Saturn rings. Mrs. Wingfield sat down on the hillside and held on to her two dogs to keep them out of the corn- field, but for no reason she felt uneasy and decided to continue on down. Her husband and sons were walk- ing down some yards in front of her and as she lifted her eyes from the steep bank she was surprised by a blue flashing light which appeared to come from overhead and sweep across the ground in front. The light swept the ground as if reflecting off a shiny surface which was spinning. The following words are those con- tained in a written statement given to us by Mrs. Wingfield. \"I had suddenly felt uneasy and as I walked down towards the circle I saw blue flashes on the ground which occurred with regular frequency. This happened with the evening sun shin- ing and was quite distinctive but was not seen by my husband or sons who were further down the hill. The flashes appeared like reflections from something unseen and occurred every second or possibly with shorter fre- quency. They were like the reflec- tions from a blue reflector on, say, the slowly rotating blades of a helic- 11"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"Plate Two: Westbury Circle ©1987 Colin Andrews Plate Three: Circle below White Horse © 1987 Colin Andrews. 12 MUFON UFO JOURNAL, No. 243, July 1988"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"Plate Four with white \"disc\"; ©1987 F. Taylor opter. When the sun passed beyond a cloud, the blue flashes ceased.\" Another 15.6 meter diameter circle had one of the most spectacular floor patterns we had seen. The radial swirl was so impressive it felt just too good to walk on. The floor had a dis- tinct similarity to the effect one sees at a fireworks display when the more expensive fireworks rockets explode at high altitude, throwing out hundreds of radial lines of burning phosphorous. This circle in a Westbury cornfield took on a 0.5 revolution, anti-clock- wise swirl as though the entity pro- ducing the circle was revolving. Plate 2 shows Pat and Busty in the circle with the White Horse on the hillside in the background (Plate 3). Tens of wheat stems were broken, many of them thrown out on to the surround- ing area. The force involved was so great it caused the dry crusted sur- face soil to break up into powder. We gathered at Old Sarum airfield to await the arrival of our aircraft. We planned a reconnaisance that would take us over the new set of five cir- cles at Upton Scudamore, which were formed sometime between dusk on August 6 and approximately mid- day on August 7. The pilot, Barry MUFON UFO JOURNAL, No. 243, July 1988 Dyke, who found the quintuplets also saw this single circle in the middle of a field between Westbury village and the famous White Horse. Plate 3 shows this field and others in which many circles have appeared in recent years. The most recent can be seen bottom center, just two days after it appeared and as photographed by us during our reconnaisance on Saturday, August 8, 1987. Our trip was memorable; not only did we observe and photograph the six cir- cles, but we found others. We were quite confident fifteen circles had appeared around the town of War- minster in less than 24 hours. Most were less than 12 hours old when discovered. My photographs of this circle, taken from the aeroplane, were being entered into the file when I noticed an unusual marking in the field on one of them, some 35 meters southwest of the circle. Under the magnifying glass I was sure this was a narrow, single ring. I telephoned Dr. Terence Meaden, who lived much nearer the site that I, and asked him if he would check it out. Two hours later, he called me and confirmed it was as I had thought, only the second known independent ring yet found and like the other one at Kimpton, near Andover, Hampshire, it was in a field with a nearby circle. The same phen- omena appeared to be responsible for both circles and rings. In addition, we have thoroughly investigated a photograph taken by Busty of Pat and I in the circle. In the picture, a white, disc-shaped object could be seen about 18 cms. from the swirled center of the circle. Pat and I both appeared to be looking at this object but neither of us can recall why we were looking in that direc- tion. We certainly did not see any- thing of that description at the time. The sun had just set behind Busty when the picture was taken, which would seem to rule out light refraction. We have taken highly magnified prints of this object which also appeared on the negatives. They show a very clear disc-shaped object, bright white in color and with well- defined edges, it remains another facet to the subject we are frankly unable to account for. We have learned how important it is to keep an open mind and remain flexible in receptivity. (Disc. Plate 4) 13"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"\"Prehistoric\" UFOs: A Review By Thomas E. Bullard, PhD. Dr. Bullard holds a doctorate in folklore from Indiana University where he wrote his dissertation on UFOs. His last appearance here was a comparative summary of UFO abduction reports. What Charles Fort started when he collected old reports of strange aerial phenomena has continued as a dis- tinctive and vigorous branch of ufol- ogy today. Historical research lures investigators with the hope of digging out bygone sightings and even un- known fossil evidence for a whole lost world of past observations and beliefs by which to gain a unique perspective on the present. Takers have been many and diligent. The result is a growing but scattered literature too often overlooked and unappreciated. This review will highlight some of the important contributions to pre-1947 historical research. PHANTOM AIRSHIPS The chief focus and biggest find of historical ufology is the phantom air- ship wave of 1896-97. Fort turned up a few reports from April 1897 in the New York newspapers, and Donald Keyhoe referred to a lighted airship over the Midwest in his list of old sightings in The Flying Saucers Are Real (1950). In his first UFO book, Flying Saucers (1953), skeptic Donald H. Menzel extended the wave in time and space with reports from Califor- nia late in 1896. References to these airships became part of a litany recited by many subsequent authors to prove that UFOS were nothing new and by no means discountable in every case as misidentified airplanes. By the mid-1960s researchers turned from authority to original sources and began to search old newspapers in earnest for airship reports. The extent and complexity of this wave became plain as articles in FSR by Jerome 14 Clark (Jan. - Feb. 1965, July - Aug. 1966, July - Aug. 1967), Lucius Parish (May - June 1965), Clark and Parish (Sept. - Oct. 1968, Jan. - Feb. 1969), Donald B. Hanlon (Sept. - Oct. 1966) and Hanlon and Jacques Vallee (Jan. - Feb. 1967) detailed sightings and landings from a dozen states. Airship articles spread to Fate with an article by Parish (Nov. 1966) and a series of three articles there by Clark and Loren Coleman (May - July 1973). Clark and Parish again collaborated during the mid-1970s in articles for Saga's UFO Report. Parish carried on a column about historical UFOs with emphasis on 1897 in Skylook throughout 1972. Geographically specialized articles appeared as early as 1938, in the win- ter issue of Prairie Schooner, when Rudolph Umland published an ac- count of the airship over Nebraska, based on WPA research in newspap- ers from that state. A second article on Nebraska airships, authored by Roger L. Welsch, appeared in the 1979 volume of Nebraska History. Robert G. Neeley, Jr. presented an exhaustively researched record of the airship in Illinois in the Journal of UFO Research (1979), George M. Eberhart followed the ship through Ohio (Pursuit, Winter 1977), and Hanlon's 1966 article covered activity in Texas. Dale M. Titler added a Canadian and Siberian phase to the wave with reports of a stray balloon from the summer and fall of 1897 (see Clark and Parish, FSR, Jan. - Feb. 1969), while Loren Gross expanded on this discovery in his book Charles Fort, the Fortean Society, and UFOs (1976), and William Retoff gave further details in \"The Great Canadian Star- ship Invasion\" (Ideal's UFO Maga- zine, August 1980). Extended surveys of the 1896 - 97 wave became the norm in many UFO books published during the 1970s, notably John Keel's UFOs - Opera- tion Trojan Horse (1970), David M. Jacobs' The UFO Controversy in America (1975), and Paris Flam- monde's UFO Exist! (1976). As the literature has grown, so has the need for self-correction. The Leroy, Kan- sas, \"calfnapping\" case made famous by Vallee in Anatomy of a Pheno- menon (1965) proved to be a hoax when researched in depth by Clark (Fare, Feb. 1977), and H. Michael Simmons exposed the equally familiar Aurora, Texas, crash in his article, \"Once Upon A Time in the West\" (Magonia, Aug. 1985). In several books the airships have moved to center stage. They occupy a large fraction of Mysteries in the Skies: UFOs in Perspective, by Gor- don I.R. Lore and Harold H. Deneault (1968), and Loren Gross devoted The UFO Wave of 1896 (1974) to a detailed study of the first phase of the wave. The most extensive investiga- tion of sources ever undertaken was completed recently by Robert G. Neeley, Jr., who spent three years travelling throughout the country to search some 5,000 newspapers for airship reports. His The Airship Chron- icle, published by the Fund for UFO Research, summarizes the sightings he uncovered in some 2,500 entries and offers a definitive record of this largest of airship waves. THEORIES Interpretation of the airships as something other than spaceships seen through turn-of-the-century eyes has been the focus of several books and articles. Clark and Coleman adapted their findings to a chapter in The Unidentified (1975), a book seeking to link UFO phenomena with the psycho- logical archetypes of C.G. Jung. Ron Miller's \"Jules Verne and the Great Airship Scare\" (IUR May - June 1987) favors the sociological argument that whatever the ultimate nature of the MUFON UFO JOURNAL, No. 243, July 1988"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"Charles Fort actually proves a Johnny-come-lately in historical perspective. objects may have been, the descrip- tions derived from expectations of the day. Louis Winkler holds out for the airship being an actual invention on trial (MUFON UFO Journal, Mar. 1982), while Daniel Cohen's book, The Great Airship Mystery (1981), takes the opposite view that all the sightings originate in conventional phenomena. The longest study is Jean Sider's L'Airship de 1897 (1987), a careful history based on extensive sources. Unlike Cohen, Sider recog- nizes the dynamic aspects of the wave and traces its spread through- out the country. He analyzes the descriptions along with the context of experimentation and fiction literature, then eliminates alternative explana- tions to conclude that a legitimate unknown accounts for some of the reports. EUROPEAN ENCOUNTERS England joined the airship business with waves in the spring of 1909 and winter of 1913, both discovered by Fort and explored in depth by recent researchers. In FSR (Nov. - Dec. 1970, Jan. - Feb. 1971), Carl Grove published his collection of 1909 re- ports. Paul Screeton followed one newspaper's coverage (MUFOB, Sum- mer 1980). David Clarke, Granville Oldroyd and Nigel Watson have just completed a massive catalogue of 1913 newspaper reports for the Fund for UFO Research. These two waves intertwine so closely with fears of German invasion that they have pro- vided ammunition for an interpreta- tion of airships as a form of social panic (Roger Sandell, Peter Roger- son, MUFOB, Autumn 1978; Watson, Magonia, Spring 1980). Hints that the Russians also shared in the 1913 wave have appeared in FSR (Mar. 1984, Feb. 1987). Scandinavia has been another busy area for UFOs, with \"balloon\" reports from 1897, phantom airships in 1909, and phantom airplanes during World War I. Then the action really began: An article by David G. Markham in Doubt (Jan. 1942) dealt with \"ghost MUFON UFO JOURNAL, No. 243, July 1988 fliers\" over Sweden, and John Keel reported in depth on these 1933 - 37 sightings in FSR (May - June, July - Aug. 1970; July - Aug., Sept. - Oct. 1971). The \"ghost rockets\" appeared in 1946 and again received mention in Doubt (#16, 17). A survey by Bjorn Overbye was published in FSR (May -June, July - Aug. 1970), and Loren Gross devoted a booklet, The Mys- tery of the Ghost Rockets (1974, 2nd. ed. 1982), to these reports. Swedish investigators have obtained access to extensive Swedish government files concerning these sightings and are also collecting newspaper reports and interviewing witnesses, so the \"ghost\" waves promise to be the best-research- ed of all historical UFO events. Some results have been published by And- ers Liljegren (FSR, Dec. 1986; nearly every issue of the AFU Newsletter [Box 11027, S-600, 11 Norrkoping, Sweden] also contains an article on this work). In 1987 Erland Sundqvist published Spokflygama - 46, a book devoted mostly to the ghost rockets. The best summary of Swedish research is \"The Ghost Rockets,\" by Liljegren and Clas Svahn, in UFOs 1947 -1987. OTHER WAVES A summary and bibliography of other waves can be found in Nigel Watson's booklet, Phantom Aerial Waves and Flaps (1987), an essential survey of UFO concentrations over the past century and a half. Historical reports not associated with a wave are scattered and difficult to find. Of course Fort's books are major sour- ces, as are the pages of Doubf and Carl Pabst's ongoing \"Notes of Cha- rles Fort\" column in each issue of Pursuit. The sourcebooks compiled by William Corliss from old scientific publications carry on Fort's work in a more systematic way, and often pro- vide full texts of reports. Louis Winkler's Catalogue of UFO-Like Data Before 1947 (Fund for UFO Research, 1984) contains a valuable list of reports as well. Lore and Deneault's Mysferies in the Skies and Loren Gross's Charles Fort, the For- tean Society and UFOs cover the period from the 1896 wave to 1947 by revealing many unfamiliar reports. The series by Clark and Parish in UFO Report also includes some \"strays,\" especially the article on UFOs from the 1920s. Perhaps the most thorough survey of all is Michel Bougard's La Chro- nique des Ol/M (1977), which culls reports for the period 1800-1947 from many UFO publications and lists summaries in chronological order. A survey of historical New Zealand reports by Harold J. Knapman and a similar survey for Australia by Bill Chalker appeared in UFO Research Australia Newsletter (Nov. - Dec. 1983). George M. Eberhart's Geobifa- liography of Anomalies includes a great many historical reports from the U.S. and Canada, while from Eng- land, David Clarke and Granville Oldroyd concentrate on a particular kind of phenomenon often reported early in the century in their booklet, Spooklights: A British Survey (1985). The UFO literature contains many other old reports, but the reader must look far and wide for these indi- vidual cases, some of them accidental discoveries and some the reminiscen- ces of witnesses speaking out after decades. A few examples include Jerome Clark's discussion of a sup- posed 1884 airship crash in Nebraska (IUR Nov. - Dec. 1986), Dwight Whalen's discovery of a mystery air- plane over Ontario in 1911 (Fate Dec. 1982), and the reprint of a newsclipping about an 1889 airship over Paris, Texas (Crux Summer 1985). Madge Brosius Allyn kept secret her observation of a flying \"cucumber\" in 1903 for 68 year (Fate March 1971), Paul T. Collins recalled the 1942 \"Battle of Los Angeles\" UFO (Fate July 1987), while William D. Leet and Leonard H. Stringfield reported their \"foo fighter\" sightings from World War II (MUFON UFO Journal Jan. - Feb. 1979; Inside Saucer Post... 3-0 Blue [1957]). PRE-1800 Treatments of aerial phenomena before 1800 are even more hapha- 15"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"zard, and often left to the discredited \"ancient astronauts\" school. Yet the peoples of ancient and Medieval times saw strange sights in the sky, and the Reformation period was a gold- en age for aerial wonders. Donald H. Menzel draws on original sources for reports included in Flying Saucers (1953) and The UFO Enigma (1977), as does Jacques Vallee in Anatomy of a Phenomenon (1965) and Pass- port fo Magonia (1969). Historical reports from all ages are plentiful in Hying Saucers on the Attack (1954) by H.T. Wllkins, and W. Raymond Drake bases a whole series of books on historical records. Again instances turn up throughout the literature, for instance Chinese reports (FSR June 1985) or 18th century sightings in the Clark and Parish series. George M. Eberhart includes an extensive biblio- graphy of pre-1800 UFOs in his UFOs and the Extraterrestrial Con- tact Movement (1986). A concise summary of UFOs in these eras appears in Michel Bougard's article in UFOs: 1947 -1987. Charles Fort actually proves a Johnny-come-lately in historical pers- pective. A Roman author, Julius Obsequens, gathered reports of \"prod- igies\" from Roman historians, most notably Livy, and these reports include the aerial objects and falls of sub- stances such as blood which we now identify with Fort (the surviving frag- ments of Obsequens are included and translated in v. 14 of Loeb Classical Library set of Livy's works). In the 16th century a French author, Simon Gou- lart, collected similar strange events, and his interest in UFOs is treated in Les So/ei/s de Simon Goulart (1981), by I.L. Olivier and Jean-Francois Boedec. Another 16th century author qualifies as the most ambitious collector of all: This was Conrad Lycosthenes, who scoured numerous sources to compile a collection of every strange event reported from the creation of the world to his own time. His Prodigiorum ac Ostentorum Chronicon (1557) is a huge listing of mainly aerial phenomena. An English translation entitled The Conrad Chronicle is forthcoming this year from the Dahlin Family Press. Linguistics Expert Vouches For Mj-12 Briefing Paper By Robert H. Bletchman, J.D. Attorney Bletchman is MUFON State Director for Connecticut. After viewing the Ted Koppel ABC- TV \"Night Line\" program on June 24, 1987, in which Bill Moore debated the validity of the MJ-12 documents with Philip J. Klass, I was intrigued as to how the briefing papers might be authenticated. Since Admiral Roscoe H. Hillenkoetter (MJ-1) was listed as the briefing officer on the report for President-Elect Dwight D. Eisenhower, dated 18 November 1952, and was listed first, I proposed to Bill Moore that Hillenkoetter most likely authored the memo. Consequently, it was felt that the authenticity of the author could be tested by a comparison of the writing style between known writ- ings of Admiral Hillenkoetter and the briefing memo. Dr. Roger W. Wescott, Professor of Linguistics at Drew University in Madison, New Jersey, and a reknowned linguist, was contacted and his exper- tise solicited to make such an analy- sis and evaluation. Dr. Wescott advised that he would approach the problem 16 through stylistics, a discipline of lingu- istics, which deals with the more-or- less unique design or syntax of eve- ryone's written language. Twenty-seven (27) letters and memos written when Admiral Hillenkoetter headed up the C.I.A. were provided to Dr. Wescott along with the briefing memo. The following constitute quotations made by Dr. Wescott in his letter of April 3, 1988 to me. \"Admiral Hillen- koetter's epistolary style resembles that of most bureaucrats, very blandly conventional and lacking the eccen- tricities of diction which make the writings of some individuals so dis- tinctive (and consequently so hard to counterfeit). While it is true that some of his memoranda contain errors of spelling and punctuation, these are rare and do not recur often enough to constitute stylistic markers. \"On the other hand, I did find time today to re-read all 27 of the Hillen- koetter communications that you have sent me since August, 1987 and to order them chronologically. They seem to fall rather clearly into three groups: those written before 1947 and 1950, which don't concern unidentified fly- ing objects (hereafter UFOs); those written between 1952 and 1961, which express an urgent interest in obtain- ing more information about UFOs and preventing military 'cover-ups' of the subject; and those written between 1962 and 1970, which adopt a non- committal stance, maintaining interest but exhibiting scepticism about the extra-terrestrial hypothesis (hereafter ETH). \"The crucial time-period here is ob- viously the fall of 1961, when Hillen- koetter apparently withdrew from participation in the National Investiga- tions Committee on Aerial Pheno- mena (NICAP). Philip Klass and other critics of MUFON predictably treat both the presidential briefing memo of November 18, 1952, and the congressional letter of August 22, 1961, as forgeries. But the stylistic evidence that he cites seems to me to be quite inconclusive: I myself, for example, alternate between writing 'April 3, 1988' and '3 April 1988' in my own letters. \"In ambiguous situations like this, I MUFON UFO JOURNAL, No. 243, July 1988"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"tend to follow an equivalent of the legal principle 'innocent till proven guilty.' My analog is 'authentic till proven fraudulent'.\" After eight hours of intensive study of the 27 submitted memoranda and letters, Dr. Roger W. Wescott mailed another letter to me, dated April 7, 1988, which is quoted verbatim: \"Last evening I had a pleasant phone chat with Stanton Friedman. He asked me to make a further statement on the 27 communications from Admiral Hil- lenkotter which you had sent me — a statement which would be explicit to the point of redundancy (and there- fore almost impossible to misinter- pret). So here it is: \"In my opinion, there is no compell- ing reason to regard any of these communications as fraudulent or to believe that any of them were written by anyone other than Hillenkoetter himself. This statement holds for the controversial presidential briefing mem- orandum of November 18, 1952, as well as for the letters, both official and personal\". (Associate Editor's note: This is indeed a significant breakthrough on MJ-12). A brief biographical sketch of the writer is in order: Roger Williams Wescott, born in Philadelphia in 1925, graduated summa cum laude and first in his class from Princeton in 1945. After receiving his Ph.D. in Linguis- tics there in 1948, he held a Rhodes Scholarship at Oxford. Following an- thropological fieldwork in Nigeria, he founded and directed the African Language Program at Michigan State University. In addition to his aca- demic duties, Mr. Wescott has directed radio programs and made network television appearances. Since 1966, Mr. Wescott has been Professor of Linguistics in the Humani- ties Division of the Graduate School and Professor of Anthropology in the Social Science Division of the College of Liberal Arts at Drew University in Madison, New Jersey. He founded Drew's Anthropology Department and chaired it for 12 years. For the past seven years, he has been Director of Drew's Linguistic Program. I am indebted to the following gen- tlemen for their participation in bring- ing my idea to fruition in this impor- tant disclosure on the MJ-12 papers: William L. \"Bill\" Moore, Stanton T. Friedman, J. Antonio Huneeus, Tom A. Benson, and Walt Andrus (editing of this article). An expression of thanks is also offered to MUFON, CUFOS, FUFOR, and Fair Witness as America's most significant UFO organizations for agreeing to pay Dr. Wescott for services rendered. Arkansas Sightings By Ed Mazur, State Director Ed Mazur is a MUFON state director. Numerous sightings have been re- ported in and around Foreman and Ashdown in Southwestern Arkansas. Some have been quite spectacular and all have been seen at night. The Sheriffs office in Little River County has received over 60 reports and they are still coming in. The aerial displays attracted visitors from a four, state area to view the strange lighted objects. Photographs were taken and several of them were pub- lished in the Ashdown Little River News. MUFON UFO JOURNAL, No. 243, July 1988 The sightings were first reported as early as September and October. They increased in November and December even though many wit- nesses were reluctant to report their experience for fear of ridicule. Janu- ary brought forth the greatest number and prompted the radio stations in Texarkana and Channel 4 News of Little Rock to cover the story. The Arkansas State Director was contacted by a Texarkana news reporter on January 27th and he was directed to our MUFON representa- tive and State Section Director, Paul Rutherford. Paul was already on the scene and had been interviewing a number of witnesses. During his investigation, Paul himself spotted an orange-colored glowing light rising in the western sky which he described as having a parallelogram configura- tion. After the object departed, the Sheriffs car he was in received a radio report of another sighting about 15 miles away. That one was des- cribed as triangular in shape. Amateur astronomers, news repor- ters, former Air Force personnel, and law enforcement officials attested to the presence of the unusual lights and stated their strong beliefs that the objects could not have been stel- lar bodies or lights from any type of aircraft. Many were awed by what they saw. Others were frightened. Three girls driving home from a basketball game were chased by a pulsating red- blue-green light. Evasive action failed to shake the object. The driver then accelerated but the object kept pace. As the car pulled into the driveway of a friend's home, the object departed and was seen across a field and then disappeared. All of the girls were scared to the point of hysteria and have been experiencing nervous symp- toms ever since. State Section Director Charles Huf- fer, of Fayetteville, and- newspaper reporter Bill McComber, of the North- west Times Herald, journeyed to Foreman to check into the sightings. Charles, an amateur radio operator, kept in contact with the State Direc- tor, also a ham operator, and reported that they too, had seen a glowing orange object in the evening sky. Both Paul Rutherford and Charles Huffer described a surface sighting by a local woman who had seen a brightly glowing object next to her barn that lit up the entire building and the area around it. It appeared solid and glowed a dull red at the bottom. It did not appear to touch the surface of the ground. The State Director then drove to the area to examine the site with a radiation meter, take photos, and obtain soil samples. Paul Rutherford is to be com- mended for his diligent work in inter- viewing the witnesses to the sightings.

Capt. Clarence Shipe Chiles and his co-pilot, John B. Whitted, each corroborated the oth- er's report of the fantastic craft. They were flying along serenly in a DC-3 Eastern airliner at 5,000 feet about 20 miles southwest of Montgomery, Ala- bama, at 2:45 AM when the UFO came at them. It looked like a B-29 \"blown up about four times and stripped of its wings.\" In the seconds during which the craft swooped past and shot up into the clouds, it cast a light more vivid than lightning, they said. They also saw two decks of big square windows. \"We looked out the right side of the cockpit and saw a tremendous light,\" Capt. Chiles said. \"The first thing that came to my attention was the long stream of flame coming out of the rear end of the craft. Then I noticed the two rows of square win- dows — we couldn't see any people aboard. It was traveling too fast for that. The craft seemed to be four times the circumference of a B-29 fuselage but it was only a little longer. There were no wings whatever. The object passed us on our right, then, as if the pilot had seen us and wanted to avoid us, it zoomed up into the same cloud it came out of.\" \"I'd say that when it shot up into the clouds it was going between 500 and 700 miles an hour.\" Whitted said. \"I've seen meteors — they look pretty close when you're a pilot — but I've never seen anything like this.\" As the UFO passed them their comparatively small DC-3 fluttered in the prop-wash, jet-wash or rocket- wash. It sent out tremendous shock waves. The brilliant light of the craft and the flame of its propellant brought \"lightning blindness\" to their cockpit, 18 the pilots said, and they had to turn up their instrument lights. Only one of the 20 passengers aboard the DC- 3 saw the UFO. Clarence L. McKel- vie said that he saw \"an unbroken stream of light ... that sped past and above the plane and streaked into a cloud.\" The airliner was headed for Atlanta, Georgia at the time. Just prior to the incident, J.V. Morris and Lindsay Fall were hunting near Coving- ton, Georgia, when they saw \"an unusuallly bright light — as bright as a lighted room,\" speeding westward and out of sight in a few seconds. About the same time a crew chief at Robins Air Force Base in Macon, Georgia, reported seeing an extremely bright light pass overhead, traveling at high speed. Also, a pilot flying near the Virginia - North Carolina state line, reported that he had seen a bright object in the direction of Montgo- mery, Alabama, at about the exact time the Eastern Airlines DC-3 was \"buzzed\". *** THIRTY FIVE YEARS AGO - July 1953: The crew of a Navy jet flying from Seattle, Washington, to Colorado at 8:10 PM on the 1st, spotted a fast moving triangular- shaped craft moving southeast by east at an altitude estimated to be 18,000 feet. At the time of the sight- ing the aircraft was over LaGrande, Oregon, flying at 11,000 feet. The craft, which appeared to be a bright metallic color, was also observed from the ground by West Coast Air- lines personnel at LaGrande. At about 3 PM on the 19th two adult witnesses sighted a black object move out of a high white cloud over Oak Ridge, Tennessee. The UFO began to travel at a tremendous speed in large circles for at least five minutes. At times it appeared to be in the shape of a cigar and at other times round. The object was extremely black in color, having an appearance of a deep black metal surface with a fine gloss. No sound was heard. The UFO flew east at a high speed for what appeared to be three miles, then suddenly stopped. The object was then joined by two more identical objects. A formation similar to a spread \"V\" was formed and the three UFOs, again at a tremendous speed, moved out of sight to the east. They did not leave a vapor trail. Dozens of witnesses in Denison and Sherman, Texas — and in the control tower in nearby Perrin Air Force Base — observed seven UFOs maneuvering at an altitude of five to eight thousand feet at 9:39 PM on the 26th. The formation was in groups of three with one trailing, and then com- ing together to form the letter Z. the formation then circled while gaining altitude and faded from sight, one object at a time. They were visible for 16 minutes. *** THIRTY YEARS AGO - July 1958: Two mechanics were working on the landing gear of a Lockheed F- 104 jet interceptor at Holloman Air Force Base, New Mexico, at dusk, when they noticed a noiseless, disc- shaped craft in an open area near the runway, not more than 50 yards away. The UFO looked something like a wide, thick-brimmed hat. Its top was dome-shaped, with several oblong openings, the craft wobbled as it hovered only a few feet off the ground. Occasionally it tilted upward, revealing three ball-like appendages on its underside. The outer rim of the craft was thick and flat. The craft was estimated to be about 25 feet in diameter and six or seven feet high. The openings intermittenly gave off a bluish light, first one, and then another. A wide band of highly polished metal, resembling polished brass, extended around the dome like a ring. The entire craft appeared to be metallic in color. After several minutes the craft moved away at a high rate of speed. (Date of sighting unknown). *** MUFON UFO JOURNAL, No. 243, July 1988"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"\\ \\ TWENTY FIVE YEARS AGO - July 1963: Jim Wheeler was driving his truck near Maryhill, Washington shortly after midnight on the 26th when he saw a flash in his mirror. At first he assumed it was the lights of a car coming up behind him. Another flash of light caused him to look to the left, and he saw a huge disc- shaped object giving off an eerie light. It was about 1,000 feet in the air and on about a 45-degree angle from the ground, riding along on the top of the ridge. Wheeler estimated the disc was between 35 and 50 feet across, and about 20 feet thick. The disc followed along beside his truck, turning the inside of the cab a bluish color, for about 20 minutes as he was climbing a long hill. Wheeler said when he was about two-thirds of the way up the hill the disc tipped over on its side, revealing a glowing white top, made a sharp turn to the right, and disap- peared over the hill — all in the span of about 15 seconds. Another truck driver about a mile behind Wheeler's truck witnessed the same thing. *** TWENTY YEARS AGO - July 1968: What began as a rather roman- tic airplane flight on the 8th ended as a nerve-wracking experience for two Warren, Ohio brothers and their dates when they encountered a UFO which simulated an attack on their aircraft at an altitude of about 4,000 feet. Richard Montgomery, 24, was piloting his own Cessna 172 Sky- hawk, with his brother Ken. Richard said: \"We were cruising over the west side of Warren about 10:20 PM, headed east when I noticed an object coming toward us from the direction of Youngstown to the southeast. I swung over in that direction to get a closer look when the object headed directly toward our airplane. It stopped and hung motionless in the air at an altitude of about 4,000 feet moment- arily and as our aircraft came closer it moved swiftly upward and came back at us from another angle. The pilot described the UFO as cylindrical in shape, of metallic com- position with a muffled light beaming from underneath. He said it was from 16 to 20 feet from top to bottom, MUFON UFO JOURNAL, No. 243, July 1988 from six to 10 feet in diameter and was poised in a vertical position dur- ing its entire flight. Montgomery said that although the object was cylindri- cal in shape, the metal sides had a sort of octagonal appearance. \"I sent my aircraft into several maneuvers and the UFO kept following me, stay- ing a distance of 150 to 200 yards away all the time. After several maneuvers which simulated a military 'dogfight' the object suddenly sped in an easterly direction at amazing speed and was quickly out of sight,\" Mont- gomery said. The pilot said the staff at Youngstown airport had received several calls from area residents who reported seeing a \"dogfight\" between two aircraft in the skies over the sou- theast section of Warren. The pilot had been flying for six years. On the 29th, several scientists told Congress there were too many sight- ings of UFOs to rule out the possibil- ity that earth might be under surveil- lance by creatures from outer space. \"This is a possibility I take very seriously,\" said Dr. James McDonald, senior physicist with the Institute of Atmospheric Physics at the Univer- sity of Arizona. \"If there is even a chance of surveillance, we should explore it.\" Noting UFO sightings by responsible and skeptical witnesses around the world, McDonald said: \"Far too many defy our best analy- sis.\" He said these included some cases where witnesses on the ground flashed lights into a pattern of hover- ing, disc-like craft which responded with flashing lights in the same patt- ern. \"It would be terrible if this was surveillance and our technology was represented by the Everready flash- light.\" The scientists testified at a symposium on UFOs sponsored by the House Committee on Science and Astronautics. • *** FIFTEEN YEARS AGO - July 1973: Jack Kane was driving near Lake Isabella, California at 2:10 AM on the 27th when he saw an object about 14 or 15 feet in diameter and three to four feet tall on the roadside at a 45-degree angle. He stopped and focused his car lights on it. A motor- cycle coming from the other direction stopped also. The object was dull green in color. His car, the motorcy- cle and the \"thing\" remained motion- less. Then the UFO slowly rose about three feet off the ground and started across the highway. When this happened Kane's headlights dim- med and his car radio emitted static. The object moved across the road and over the bank of the canyon. Kane said that three minutes later his car headlights were bright again and his radio became clear. He proceeded to Lake Isabella and reported the incident to the Sheriffs office. He said the object made no noise and showed no lights. It was flat on the bot- tom and round on top. Kane also said, \"my wrist watch stopped at 2:10 AM. I didn't know that it was almost 4 AM when I reached Lake Isabella. It was 2:10 AM when I sighted the object and when my watch stopped.\" *** TEN YEARS AGO - July 1978: While investigating an outdoor dis- turbance at 2 AM on the 1st, Roy Grogan said a narrow beam of light gleamed stiffly onto his front yard, sending frightened animals scrambling for shelter. \"Then I heard a noise. I looked up and there it was, a huge, round object sitting perfectly still above my house.\" When the disc-like form began blinking red, green, blue and white alternating lights, he aimed his flashlight upward and blinked it several times, and then made a mad dash for the house when the disc responded to his signal. The disc then moved away. Clora Evelyn Winscher, 52, said the rear of her car was lifted from Highway 50 in Union, Missouri, about 12:45 AM on the 27th, by what she described as \"brilliant lights,\" which descended noiselessly on her car near the Bourbeuse River bridge, then disappeared just as suddenly. Winscher's car, a 1974 Mercury Comet, bore marks from the inci- dent. Two indentations, not more than an inch wide, according to police, adorned the rear of her vehi- cle, without damage to paint or any other part of the car. Winscher said the object struck her car with \"terri- ble impact,\" accompanied by the bril- 19"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"liant light which Winscher said was \"not any real color, just very bright.\" The rear end of the car was lifted from the ground for a matter of seconds, she said, and carried east- ward toward the bridge. Winscher said she could neither steer nor stop her auto. \"I just can't explain how a very vio- lent impact like that showed nothing on that car,\" Winscher said. \"It was pushing the car, rocking it sideways from the front end to the back.\" Winscher said contact with the object made the car heat up instantly and fogged the front and side windows. There was no crash, she said, and after what \"seemed like hours to me\" the car was released and set down gently. Four other persons reported having seen a brilliant light in that direction during that time, including three members of the Union mayor's family. All reported watching a bright, steady light going across the sky. (Photos and report in MUFON file.) Cutler Correction By Bruce S. Maccabee, Ph.D. (Dr. Maccabee is with the Fund for UFO Research) The MJ-12 matter, as with Alice's trip in Wonderland, has gotten \"mys- teriouser and mysteriouser\". How- ever, I am happy to say that I can clear up at least one mystery. The astute reader of my article on Admiral Hillenkoetter (\"The Admiral and the Ultimate Secret, IUR Nov.- Dec., 1986) would note that I dis- cussed the July 14, 1954 \"Cutler- Twining\" memorandum. Although my article appeared in the Nov.-Dec. issue of IUR, it was actually written in late January of 1987. (It appeared in the Nov.-Dec. 1986 issue because that issue was over a month late in publication and came out in Febru- ary, 1987.) I was inspired to write the article by the discovery of the posi- tive statements by Admiral Hillen- koetter as quoted in the Congres- sional Record and in The New York Times. Other people in earlier years also had noted Hillenkoetter's statements, but I had information which indicated that Hillenkoetter was a member of MJ-12. Of course I knew that the existence of MJ-12 had not been con- firmed (and I should point out that I was aware of only a small part of the contents of the Eisenhower Briefing Document (EBD). Nevertheless, I did know that Bill Moore had found a 20 memorandum that mentioned MJ-12. It is a memorandum to General Twin- ing, another reputed MJ-12 member. Bill (and Jaime Shandara) had found the document during a search of an Air Force intelligence file at the National Archives. Bill had shown me the document in 1985. When I decided to write the article I also decided that I had better confirm the existence of the document if I was going to use it to establish the credibility of MJ-12. I realized the extreme importance of any document that might tend to prove a government \"withholding of evidence\". Therefore, although I didn't doubt Bill's veracity in regard to its exist- ence and its whereabouts, I must confess to a slight fear that perhaps someone else might have found the document and taken it out of the file to prevent anyone from confirming the existence of MJ-12. Bill told me the file box it had been found in and so I went to the Archives, to the Military Reference Branch, a place I had been many times in the past, to get a copy. I contacted Ed Reese before I went and told him what box I wanted to look through. Using Bill's instructions (written on the copy of the document which I had gotten from him via Stan Fried- man) I immediately located the doc- ument. Once I had the document I decided to get my own copy. I knew that I would be making copies of my copy to go with the article I was going to write. I wanted the copies of my copies to show the Archives stamp right on the front so no one would question its provenance. (Bill's copy had an Archives stamp on the back.) I therefore asked Ed Reese to stamp the front of my copy and, in the presence of Joanne Williamson, he did so. The date was 1/12/87. So now you see who the \"myste- rious visitor\" to the Archives was ... ME! If Barry Greenwood had thought to ask me how I happened to use that document as reference material in my article I could have told him and thereby shortened his article by several paragraphs at least. How did it happen, then, that the copy Moore released had the 1987 date stamped on it even though Moore claimed that his copy was obtained in 1985? Simple. I sent him a copy of my copy (a) to prove that he wasn't the only person who could locate it, (b) to prove that it was still there, and (c) because I knew that his copy wasn't as credible as mine since his stamp was on the back. I was delighted to see that he used the copy that I sent him as his \"master copy\" for the press release. In closing this brief note I would like to mention a few things about the C-T memorandum. It is a blue carbon copy on white onion skin paper. According to Moore the particular type of paper was manufactured from 1953 until the early seventies. The C- T memorandum is definitely a carbon copy (not an original) and the paper is yellowed, with most of the yellowing at the edges. The yellowing around the edges suggests that it sat flat in a pile of papers or at least was pressed into a file in such a way that the air could circulate freely around all four sides. The paper is horizontally creased in two places as if it had, at one time, been folded into thirds, as if for inser- tion into an envelope. A comparison of this document with other known Cutler memos suggests that it is genuine. MUFON MUFON UFO JOURNAL, No. 243, July 1988 r."},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"UFO Conference To Feature Investigators And Contactees Nearly a dozen UFO researchers and contactees will present latest developments at \"The UFO Expe- rience\" conference on October 8-9, 1988 at the Ramada Inn, North Haven, Connecticut. A spokesman for the conference said it will offer a comprehensive look at the UFO phenomenon, using some of the most eminent investigators who will present their research find- ings, insights and considered opinions about what UFOs are, where they come from, why they are here, what the government knows about them and why it is covering up. Author Budd Hopkins, whose best- selling book Intruders is being made into a movie, will tell of his continuing search for people who claim to have been abducted by alien beings. He concludes' that an alien civilization is conducting genetic experiments on the human race. The aliens appear to be about four feet tall with high- domed, hairless heads, large catlike eyes and grayish, leathery skin. The central figure in Intruders, Kathie Davis, will make her first pub- lic lecture at the conference, drop- ping her anonymity and revealing her true name. Davis was abducted by aliens many times from childhood on and used for an interspecies breeding experiment. The child resulting was taken from her and raised by aliens, Hopkins and Davis claim. She will describe her experiences. Other notable UFO investigator- authors will also present their find- ings. Brad Steiger, a world-famous author of more :than 100 books in the fields of psychic development, paran- ormal phenomena and the New Age, will describe his research into what he calls Star People, humans who feel their real home is not Earth but another planet or star system. He and his wife, Sherry Steiger, will also discuss their findings about \"The Fel- lowship\" — spiritual contact between humans and outer space beings. MUFON UFO JOURNAL, No. 243, July 1988 UFO research will also be pres- ented by the following: Dr. Bruce Maccabee, a U.S. Navy physicist and photo analyst, will show UFO photos and discuss their authen- ticity, telling how to distinguish genu- ine photos from hoaxes and natural phenomena. Dr. David Jacobs, associate pro- fessor of History at Temple Univer- sity, will present \"The Anatomy of an Alien,\" based on his detailed inter- views with more than 100 abductees who described in specific terms how their alien abductors looked. Dr. Jean Mundy, professor emeri- tus of psychology at Long Island Uni- versity and a practicing psychologist in New York City, will present psy- chological findings about abductees. She is involved in analysis of a nationwide poll of abductees made through Omni magazine last year, which produced more than 2,000 responders claiming to have been abducted by aliens. Lawrence Fawcett of Coventry, Connecticut, co-author of Clear Intent: The Government Coverup of UFOs, will show on the basis of government and military documents obtained through the Freedom of Information Act that the U.S. government and military have known for 40 years that UFOs are real and from beyond Earth. Philip Imbrogno of Bethel, Connec- ticut, a science teacher and UFO investigator, will present evidence of alien contacts and alien abductions in Connecticut and New York. He is co- author with Dr. J. Allen Hynek and Bob Pratt of Night Seige: The Hud- son Valley UFO Mystery, which summarizes their research into the most widely-sighted UFO in history, the boomerang-shaped \"Westchester Wing\". Walter Webb, assistant head of the Hayden Planetarium at the Boston Museum of Science, will tell how to report a UFO sighting and how a UFO investigator researches a case. The Rev. Barry Downing, a Presby- terian minister from Endwell, New York, will talk on UFOs and religion. He is author of Flying Saucers and the Bible. John White of Cheshire, interna- tionally known as a researcher of paranormal phenomena and author of 13 books in the field of consciousness studies, will moderate the conference and present a talk on \"UFOs —From Outer Space to Inner Space.\" The conference will also feature a special photo exhibit from the Center for UFO Studies. Admission is by registration only. The registration fee is $100 until August 20 and $120 thereafter. To register or for further information, write to Omega Communications, P.O. Box 2051P, Cheshire, Connecti- cut 06410. However, if space permits at conference time, admission will be permitted at $60 per day and $15 per event.

Webb MUFON Astronomy Consultant JULY 1988 Bright Planets (Evening Sky): 22 Mars, moving from Aquarius through a corner of Pisces into Cetus during the month, continues to brighten. Shining at -1.2 magnitude in mid-July, the orange-red planet rises then in the east about 11:30 PM and three- quarters of an hour earlier by month's end. Observers with telescopes might begin now to study our neighbor as its tiny disc steadily increases in diameter. By late September, Mars will be at its nearest to Earth since 1971. This marks the red planet's best appearance for Northern Hemis- phere observers since 1956 because it will be higher in the sky where the air provides a steadier image. Look now for the bright south polar cap on Mars, still large and white, as it begins to shrink during the Martian spring; the dark features (deserts like the light areas, not vegetation); and perhaps occasional clouds. Also this month the Soviet Union is scheduled to launch two unmanned spacecraft toward Mars. They are designed to orbit the red planet next spring and then place landers on the satellite Phobos. ( Saturn, in Sagittarius, lies low in the SE at dusk and advances westward across the southern sky during the night. Bright Planets (Morning Sky): Venus continues to pull away from the Sun, reaching maximum brilliancy' (-4.5) on the 19th. It rises in the NE about 3 AM in mid-month. The cres- cent Moon is near the bright planet on July 10 and 11. Mars is well up in the SE at dawn. Some 20° above Venus stands the second brightest planet, Jupiter (magni- tude -2.2), in Taurus. This largest of all planets rises in the NE about 1:30 AM in mid-July. The crescent Moon is nearby on the 9th. Saturn sets in the WSW about 3:30 AM. Meteor Showers: Meteor activity is intense from the second half of July through the first half of August. Not only are there two major meteor showers but also several minor showers as well. So UFO investigators should be suspicious of any short-duration (seconds), fast-moving, glowing spheres or ovoids reported during this period. The Delta Aquarids begin in mid-July and last a month, achieving a peak on the morning of the 28th (about 20 meteors per hour). Unfortunately a full moon interferes all night, severely diminish- ing the count. These meteors radiate from the direction of Aquarius in the south. The swifter August Perseids commence in low numbers about July 25. MUFON UFO JOURNAL, No. 243, July 1988"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"IS, MESSAGE, continued ing his own book.

Ray W. Boeche, Chair- man and the host committee are to be congratulated for conducting a professionally managed symposium. Mr. Clinton A. Hoover, Director of the Nebraska Center for Continuing Education, deserves our thanks for providing an ideal environment for the meeting. He was so impressed that he extended an open invitation for the MUFON Symposium to return to Lincoln. (The MUFON 1989 Inter- national UFO Symposium is sche- duled for Las Vegas, Nevada with John Lear as the host chairman.) The highlights of this year's sympo- sium centered around abductions, the ET hypothesis, the Gulf Breeze, Flor- ida Case and the MJ—12 documents. Jaime Shandera replaced Bill Moore on the program by delivering a first- hand account of his experience with the MJ-12 documents. Awards and recognition were bes- towed upon several leading UFOlo- gists Budd Hopkins received the Annual MUFON Award plaque for the most outstanding contributioin to Ufology for 1987-88 and a $250 check from the Fund for UFO Research in memory of Isabel L. Davis. Stan Gordon, State Director for Pennsyl- vania was the recipient of the MUFON Award for \"Meritorious Achievement in a UFO Investigatioin\" for 1987 presented by Dan Wright, Deputy Director of Investigations. The award was for Stan's December 18, 1987 case report (log #871209) of a Greens- burg, Pennsylvania sighting on Sep- tember 3, 1987 by a shopping mall security guard, also witnessed and anonymously reported by three police officers and a theater manager. The MUFON 1988 International UFO Symposium Proceedings were dedi- cated to Dan Wright for his enthusi- astic leadership and demonstrative action to elevate UFO field investiga- JENNIE ZEIDMAN tions to a professional stature. Important action items resolved at the MUFON Annual Board of Direc- tors Meeting on June 26, 1988 were the following: (1) 500 more copies of the MUFON Field Investigator's Man- ual (Third Edition) will be printed. (2) Assignments will be made to specific individuals to revise or update exist- ing sections or add new sections such as abductions, under the direction of Raymond Fowler, Dan Wright and Walt Andrus in order to publish the 4th edition. (3) Ted Phillips, who had previously been assigned to the MUFON Staff for landing trace cases (CE II), was removed from the Board as Specialization Coordinator. (4) George R. Coyne was seated on the Board after his election to the posi- tion of Central Regional Director by a popular vote of members in the central states. (5) It was proposed and approved that Jennie Zeldman (Mrs. Gordon Zeidman) be elected to the MUFON Board of Directors with the specific title of \"Coordinator of Technical Analysis,\" a position in which she is eminently qualified. (6) Approved adding Ron Ricketts to the MUFON Staff for \"Computer Sciences.\" (7) Dr. Willy Smith will receive only the most well docu- mented UFO cases from MUFON that could qualify for his computer file called \"UNICAT\" or \"MAYBE- CAT.\" (8) The system approved at the 1987 Board Meeting for funneling all UFO sighting reports through the State Directors, to Dan Wright with originals to MUFON headquarters has been effective and will be con- tinued. (9) The MUFON Field Inves- tigator's Exam will be administered by the individual State Directors to anyone desiring to upgrade from Field Inves- tigator Trainee to Field Investigator.
