FROM THE EDITOR This issue welcomes back a former editor of the Journal, Richard Hall, with some pungent points about the current state of affairs in ufology. Jennie Zeidman gives us an on-the : spot impresison of her recent visit to Rendlesham Forest, and Stan Gordon looks at current Pennsylvania reports. Philip Mantle, Overseas Liaison Officer for the Yorkshire (England) UFO Society, re-opens the case for the extraterrestrial hypothesis, and Francis Ridge, MUFON State-Section Director for Indiana, reviews NICAP's The UFO Evidence, 20 years after its original publication. Our cover is by west Texas cartoonist, Gary Oliver, pen name \"Golliver\". We hope to see more of his work in the Journal, too. July will be an issue devoted exclusively to the recently declassified Air Intelligence Report of December 10,1948, \"Analysis of Flying Objects in the U.S.\" The August or September issue of the Journal will carry complete coverage of the St. Louis Symposium, my own interview with Richard Haines, and the regular features and departments that make the MUFON Journal a recognized world- leader in the study and reporting of unidentified aerial phenomena. Obviously we think the Journal deserves your continued support. Why not take a small portion of your tax-refund and buy your Senator or Congressman, state or federal, a year's subscription beginning with the important July Air Intelligence Report issue? Since we're a non-profit organization, you'll be able to deduct the subscription from this year's taxes, too!

The night of December 27, 1980, a UFO allegedly crash-landed in a forest near a U.S. Air Base (RAF Woodbridge) in Suffolk, England. U.S. personnel went to the site, and the Base Commander communicated with three alien entities during the several hours the triangular-shaped craft was grounded for repairs. Two nights later, at the same site, the Deputy Base Commander (Lt. Col. Charles Halt) and others were treated to a repeat visit by strange pulsing lights. Halt made a \"real-time\" audio tape of that event. The case \"belongs\" to Jenny Randies, Dot Street, and Brenda Butler. Dot . and Brenda, relatively inexperienced, non-scientifically oriented UFO investigators (Dot, BUFORA; Brenda, independent) did most of the leg work, while Jenny, internationally respected Chief of Investigations for BUFORA, was their mentor, coaching from the sidelines at her home in Warrington, near Liverpool. Their book, S/cy Crash, 1 is a convoluted chronology of their investigation which creates more mysteries than it solves. It concerns itself not so much with their findings (which were few) but with their great difficulties with witnesses and government agencies. The contention is that there exists a gigantic conspiratorial coverup on the case. VISIT I spent, all day April 9, 1985, with Dot Street-in Woodbridge village, in Rendlesham Forest, and at the site, and the following Saturday evening in London-with Dot, Jenny Randies, Peter Warrington, Hilary Evans, Tomothy Good, et al, at a BUFORA meeting where the topic was British Government cover-up, and the speaker was Ralph Noyes, a former Air Ministry Intelligence Officer. Upon his RALPH NOYES and JENNY HANDLES — Photo by Jenny Zeldman retirement in 1977, Noyes was head of DS 8, the office \"in charge of UFO matters.\" Jenny said having Ralph Noyes lecture BUFORA was equivalent to having Ed Ruppelt lecture CUFOS. None of this makes me an expert on the RFA (Rendlesham Forest Affair); however I believe it has given me a perspective on the case that I haven't seen elsewhere, and I'd like to make a few comments to that effect. If nothing more, the moles among us may enjoy a few hearty laughs. 2 In our \"usual\" cases, we (the investigators) interrogate witnesses who are cooperative to the best of their abilities, i.e., they're \"on our side,\" they are truly puzzled, and they are looking to us for help. In the RFA (as presented in S/cy Crash), just the opposite is true: the primary witness has done his best to impede the investigation and confuse, mislead, and even tease the investi- gators. HALT'S ROLE I consider the primary witness to be Col. Halt. He is admittedly an eyewitness, and it is he who is identified as the originator of two of the four documents (that I am aware of) on the case. As a point of view, the four documents are: • Halt's memo to the Ministry of Defense, dated 1/31/81 • Halt's audio tape, allegedly made in \"real time,\" 12/29/80 • MOD memo, lightly censored, undated, leaked to Jenny Randies • MOD letter to Jenny re: 12/27 events, dated April 13, 1983. Once a document (written, tape, photo, whatever) is introduced into a scenario, it becomes an \"exhibit\" of (continued next page)"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"DOT STREET -Photo by Jennie Zeidman RENDLESHAM, Continued hard evidence--o>he/her true or false- -and it cannot be disregarded, for (paranoia hats on, everyone!) if false, it nevertheless has been created and disseminated for a purpose. The person indentified as responsible for the creation of that document has put himself on the line, whether of his own volition or on orders, and he must forever be associated with that document, regardless of its legitimacy. Col. Halt has certainly put himself on the line. But not all the problems with the case revolve around Col. Halt. The hard facts are that of the few alleged eye-witnesses, much of their testimony has been surrendered reluctantly, and none of their testimony (in the book) has been offered verbatim. We know that Dot and Brenda had a tape recorder, yet we are offered no question and answer transcripts or even dialogue--only generalities, sometimes second-and-third generation ones, at that (Paul Begg told Jenny that he had heard, etc ). The information therefore becomes anecdotal, not testimonial. Fine nuances and intricacies of tone and language are lost. Granted, we are not in a court of law, where verbiage of this sort is inadmissible. But we are in a court of science, where any and every shred of subjectivity or generality muddies our case. And many a court case has been lost not because that side was wrong, but because it was ill- prepared. The. testimony did not convince the jurors. Jurors become discouraged and negatively disposed when offered a can of worms. Of course S/cy Crash was constructed anecdotally for wider reader appeal, and I respect that choice of treatment by the authors. It was not intended as a technical report. And that's too bad, because I suspect that if scraped down to the bare bones, rich marrow could yet be retrieved. Going through the book-and the investigators' original tapes and notes- line by line, and constructing flow charts, could be of value in sorting ZEIDMAN IN RENDLESHAM FOREST —Photo by Dot Street things out-a method of discovering consistencies and discrepancies (and just which character did what, and with what, to whom!). CAUTION But caution is advised. Some of the material is simply not true-and not necessarily from witness testimony but from false premises put forward by the authors. E.g.; the morning after our arrival at Woodbridge, I asked my husband's liaison, Sgt. Vergil Yarborough, how long he'd been on base. \"Five years come June,\" he replied. \"Gosh,\" I said (batting eyelashes), \"that's a long time! Why, you must have been here when the UFO landed!\" \"Yeah,\" He said. \"Did you see it?\" I asked, \"Do you know anything about it?\" \"No,\" he replied, \"I just heard about it from other fellows. Best thing, you get the book. There's a book out on it-it's for sale at the base bookstore-it'll tell you all about it.\" (continued on page 15)"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"PENNSYLVANIA REPORTS By Stan Gordon It was 6:10 AM on the morning of January 2, 1985. Jerry Murtha* and Tom Mench*, ages 12 and 13, had gotten up early to check their game traps before going to school. The sun was just beginning to rise at Jamestown, a rural community located in Lebanon County. The local sky conditions were cloudy with some fog. Jerry and Tom were on the way over to the ravine where they had their traps set when they heard a dog howling from that area. They began to hurry, thinking that the dog must have been caught in one of the traps along the creek. They checked them out and found them empty. GLOWING EYES After spending some time in the area they were just about to return home, when in the distance they noticed 3 sets of glowing eyes. Assuming that they belonged to some type of game they were familiar with, they began to move in that direction. It was then that Jerry looked up to observe a strange object, which he pointed out to his friend. The two boys laid down on the ground and watched the object as it moved from southwest towards the northeast. The object was described as being oval in shape, metallic gray in color and having a series of lights flashing along its middle edge. The object was estimated to be about 15 feet in diameter, and about 200 feet above the ground. As the boys watched, the object moved very slowly, then stopped and hovered. A low humming sound could be heard as the objected began to slowly move again toward a grove of pine trees. The object then stopped over the pine grove, and from the bottom front section, a bright ball of yellow light about 4 feet in diameter was emitted. This yellow sphere slowly descended towards the top of the tree line, and went down behind the trees, which — Illustration by Jack Stoner blocked the sphere from view, but gave the boys the impression that it was going to land. A short time after the ball disappeared from sight, the main object began to move off in a slow, controlled manner, until it could no longer be seen. The sighting encounter lasted about 5 minutes. Both boys were quite disturbed, and ran home to tell their parents about what they had seen. After discussing the incident, the two boys decided to go back to the area, not only to see if they could again see the object, but to check to see if a skunk they had shot that morning was still alive. FIGURE SEEN They were about half way towards the ravine, when they noticed the silhouette of a man that seemed to have a very tall stature and large build, run through the ravine across the road from them. They assumed that whoever it was might have been raiding their traps. The sighting occurred about 1,000 yards from a high-tension power transmission tower, but electrical lines from the tower were close to the vicinity where the larger object was observed. PASU investigator Jack Vogel interviewed the boys and their families, and found them to be sincere and concerned over the incident. They are not publicity seekers and are not UFO buffs. A search of the area where the ball was seen descending did not turn up any evidence on the ground. However, two pine trees which the sphere descended over were found to have had the tops cleanly sheared off about 15 to 18 feet in height. No burn marks were apparent. PASU is also investigating another daylight UFO sighting which occurred the next day about 30 miles Northwest of Jonestown at Shamokin. These sightings are among a wave of incidents which have been reported through the first two months of 1985 across Pennsylvania. ^Indicates a psuedonym for the actual witness. It has been my policy not to use the name of actual observers in my articles unless the actual name has already been used in press coverage."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Multiple Bright Lights — Illustration by Jack Stoner On the night of October 14, 1984, numerous residents of Pennsylvania reported sightings of Unidentified Flying Objects from many sections of the state. The reports began to come in to the PASU Pa. UFO Hotline number at about 9 PM when observers in Blair County were reporting bright flashing lights and a red ball that streaked vertically into the sky. At about 9:30 PM, a woman near Vail in Blair County, observed a large torpedo-shaped object that appeared to pass low over the field. The object which made no sound, . appeared to coincide with electrical interference reported on the television by the witness's family. A short time after the object passed over, a strong sulphur smell was reported in the area. GREEN FIREBALL The majority of reports received on this night were observations of a bright green fireball with a tail, that streaked across the state from Northwest to Southeast. Initial information indicated the observed object was likely a bolide-type meteor. The National UFO Reporting Center in Seattle, Washington, also received numerous reports from other states indicating that the object which had been reported at approximately 9:50 PM had covered a large geographical area. PASU contacted the Space Center with NORAD, located in Cheyenne Mountain, to see if any re- 6 entry of space debris could account for the reports. NORAD could not at this time find any such correlation. The most unusual UFO incident occurring on this night was reported by a woman who lives near Smethport in Mckean County. The woman; who wishes to remain anonymous (this information on file with MUFON), did not report the incident to PASU until October 20th, after becoming fearful that the object she had seen at close range may have affected her health. It is important for serious UFO researchers to look into each UFO report as a separate incident. It would have been very easy to dismiss this case as another sighting of the bolide since the time and location correlated closely with those reports. A more detailed study of the event seems to rule out this possibility. It was 9:55 PM, and Mrs. X had just taken her poodle outside for their nightly stroll. She was standing just outside the backdoor, when she noticed flashes of bright light on the ground. She assumed that the 100 watt bulb located at the corner of the house was going bad. She stepped away from the house so that she could see where the light was landing, and soon realized that nothing was wrong with the bulb. BOX-SHAPE As she glanced upwards toward the roof, a strange illuminated object floated slowly over the edge of the roof and very close to it without touching it. The witness watched as the object dropped from the roof and moved lower toward a brook below where the witness was standing. Mrs. X was higher in elevation than the object was, and could see the top of the object at this point. She described the object as being shaped like an oblong box, solid in appearance, and about 5 feet long, 2'/ 2 to 3 feet high, and about 2% feet . wide. The side of the object . was flourescent appearing, but not very bright. From the center of the back of the object was a tail-like projection about 3 feet long. This tail did not give the appearance of burning like fire, but was also flourescent in appearance. This tail-like appendage was about 2 l / 2 inches wide and tapered down to about ] / 2 inch. About 5 inches from the ojbect, the appendage had a dark space of 3 or 4 inches, then it was illuminated for several inches, then there was another dark space, then it was illuminated to the end of the tail. The bottom of the object was covered with .numerous bright white lights that did not flash or blink. The witness had the feeling \"as if it was taking pictures.\" . The object, which made no sound, was first observed approximately 25 feet above the ground. It then slowly moved in a bat-like manner down towards a ditch until it was about 15 feet above the ground. Mrs. X thought that the tail appendage would drop into the ditch, but it continued to move on in a controlled manner, toward a hill.behind the house. The object then rose in altitude to about 400 feet as it passed over a group of trees and could no longer be seen. MANUEVERS The witness awaited the sound of a crash, but nothing was heard. The object as it moved around the area of the house, missed two TV antennas, a high brick chimney, a large Canadian spruce tree, a 30-feet pine tree, and 6 large Colorado spruce trees growing all around the house except in the back. About 75 feet in front of the house is the electric supply line for the witness's home and that of her (continued next page)"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"PENNSYLVANIA, Continued neighbors. About 500 feet in back of the house, and up the hill where the object moved towards, is a high-tension power line. The object, which moved towards the Southeast, was observed for less than a minute. HEALTH EFFECTS The next morning Mrs. X awoke with a severe headache and sore throat. The headache persisted day and night for two weeks after the incident. It was also noted at the location where the object had passed over the roof that the red paint and asphalt was burned off. Mrs. X also noticed that a strange black soot-like material covered floors in various rooms of her home. As she began to clean it up, she complained that when she touched it, it would sting her hands. After handling the material, Mrs. X reported that her hands and thumb cracked open which she covered with a band aid. Several days after the incident, the daughter of Mrs. X came to visit. It was at this time the UFO encounter and the soot-like material were discussed. The daughter asked her mother what she had worn the night of the encounter and it was determined it was a heavy black dress which had been hanging in the clothes closet since the night of the incident. SOOTY RESIDUE A white sheet was placed on the outside porch and the dress laid on it. The black soot fell from the dress, which seemed full:of the substance. Mrs. X feels this residue fell from the object onto herself and the dog. She has never seen this type of material around her property. Even though we had corresponded with the witness several times since she and her family made the report to us, we did not receive the dress and sheet with the residue until January 26, 1985, when a certified package was received from Mrs. X. A PASU consultant examined the material on January 28th. His report indicated that the material was examined on an optical zoom microscope at low power and on a scanning electron microscope with X- Ray analyzing capabilities. A series of scanning electron microscope photographs were taken at different powers. ANALYZED The original structure of the material was that of a square grid and has an extremely smooth surface. The color of the material samples range from black, through brown, through tan. The material is somewhat transparent at the edges. The X-Ray analyzer can detect elements except hydrogen. The material contains only carbon, and probably hydrogen. No other elements could be.detected (0.5% detectability). The analyst's conclusion is that the material is biological in nature, and should be examined more thoroughly by a biologist. Samples of the residue have been sent to MUFON for further study by Burt Monroe, Jr. Ph.D., Consultant in Biology. In conclusion, this UFO incident will continue under investigation. The close proximity of the object to the witness, the unusual shape of the object and the apparent controlled movement, seem to indicate that .something unusual did indeed occur. How the residue relates to this observation is open for speculation at this time. Mr. .Robinson and his sister Mrs. Jackson*, both retired, live near the community of Level Green, Pennsylvania, in Westmoreland County. It was December 31,1984, and the couple had just sat down in their comfortable living room, to watch the evening news. TWO TAPS About 6:10 AM, both parties heard two loud taps in succession against the living room window which faces the front porch. It was unusually warm and pleasant for that time of year, and even though it was dark, the drapes at the front window were drawn back. Immediately after hearing the taps, Mr. Robinson observed a strange object moving slowly to the right, directly in front of the window. Mr. Robinson who was sitting only 6 feet away, jumped up and ran over to the window and observed the object as it turned sideways and rose up in the air. The object passed within inches under the electric supply line which connects both Mr. Robinson's and his neighbor's home. The object continued to rise as if it was going to move over the roof, but this was blocked from view from where Mr. Robinson was looking. \"EYE\" The object when first seen in the window appeared to be facing toward the observers. It was described as being spherical in shape, and a little larger than a basketball in diameter. The main object was a bright red color, but did not glow or appear illuminated. There were two dark lines that appeared either black or dark blue in color, which seemed to extend from the center of the object in a Vrlike configuration to the top edge. In the center of this V-shaped area was a dark dot the same color as the two lines. The dot was about an inch in diameter and gave the impression \"of an eye.\" When Mr. Robinson looked out the window at the object, he saw it turn before it began to ascend towards the roof. The back of the object was of the same red color; however there were two beams of bright white light about one inch in thickness and about 16 inches long, that extended out from the object. These beams originated at the center of the back side of the object and seemed to relate to the V- configuration on the opposite side. The light from the beams did not appear to show any reflecting light on the surrounding area, and white sparks could be seen around both of the beams. The object appeared to be pulled in the direction of these two light sources. MORE TAPS After Mr. Robinson saw the object (continued next page)"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"the first time through the window, he turned on the porch light and went outside to look but nothing was seen. He turned out the light, went to sit down in his chair, and within seconds two more taps were heard at the window again. The object once again moved slowly directly in front of the window and once again was seen to go up towards the roof and out of sight. This time both Mr. Robinson and Mrs. Jackson saw the object. Mrs. Jackson had heard the taps at the window both times, but only observed the object the second time. After the second sighting, Mr. Robinson turned on both the front porch light as well as the back light, and walked all around the yard trying to see where the object had gone. It was never seen again. Mrs. Jackson told her brother what she had seen, but he didn't discuss what he had observed with her until two days later, since she was at home by herself quite often and he did not want to frighten her. The object made no sound, and no unusual interference was noted on the TV at the time. Mr. Robinson had not been a UFO believer until this experience. Reports of mini-UFOs are rare in comparison to the number of larger unidentified aerial objects we hear about. Here in Pennyslvania, we have investigated several such incidents in the last 20 years. We have cases on file where very small objects ranging in size from several inches to a few feet in diameter, were observed entering a car where the window was left down, hovering around the heads of people on a golf course in Pittsburgh and flying around the interior of a home. Even though the two observers of this mini-UFO didn't know it, our PASU unit has been receiving almost yearly reports of low level UFO activity, from several areas close to the Level Green area.

IN OTHERS' WORDS By Lucius Parish UFO reports over the Pyrenees mountains of France are detailed in an article in the April 9 issue of NATIONAL ENQUIRER. A photograph of one object was obtained by a ski instructor and police officers sighted yet another UFO in the same area. Soviet UFO reports and a mysterious \"cold fire\" are featured in the ENQUIRER'S April 23 issue. The May 14 issue contains the testimony of Danish Air Force Major Hans Petersen concerning hostile UFO incidents. However, at least one of the cases cited originated with highly questionable sources and is probably fictional The NATIONAL ENQUIRER UFO REPORT is a new paperback from Pocketbooks, containing re- written material taken from ENQUIRER issues of the past several years. The book covers numerous aspects of the UFO subject and, while it might be wise to keep your salt shaker handy while reading it, it does make it handy to have the \"highlights\" of such reports between two covers. It is now available at newsstands or may be ordered from Pocket Books - Dept. NAT - 1230 Avenue of the Americas - New York, NY 10020. Add 75C for postage and handling on mail orders; the book is priced at $2.95. Dr. Brue Maccabee's series of UFO articles continues in FATE. The May issue contains two \"classic\" cases of daylight discs, while the article in the June issue deals with UFO landings in the Southwest (the Levelland, Texas, cases from 1957 and the Socorro, N .M., case of 1964). The \"Anti-Matter/UFO Update\" column in April OMNI is devoted to the research conducted by Ellen Crystal! near Pine Bush, New York. A great deal of UFO activity was reported in the area and Crystal! comments on the investigations which she and Harry Lebelson conducted. Readers who have obtained Dr. Jan Pajak's THEORY OF THE MAGNOCRAFT (mentioned in a previous column) may like to know that he has another paper available, THE OSCILLATORY CHAMBER. As with his previous writings, this is a technical dissertation on possible UFO propulsion methods and related phenomena. Pajak's material is extremely interesting, even for anyone (such as myself) who doesn't fully appreciate, the technical aspects. More information on Pajak's research and publications can be obtained from him at: P.O. Box 1705 - Invercargill, New Zealand. A word of warning to videophiles in the reading audience. United Entertainment, Inc. of Tulsa, Oklahoma, is currently offering videotapes of two \"documentaries,\" UFO—TOP SECRET and ATTACK FROM OUTER SPACE, at $13.95 each. If that seems like a bargain, be assured that it isn't. These two films have to be the worst attempts at documentaries (on any subject) that it has ever been my misfortune to watch.

Scientific evidence indicates superior beings from other worlds are apt to find us. Can you imagine a form of life as far beyond man as man is beyond the worm? Science assures us that such highly evolved beings must exist on the stars and planets around us, if life is common in the Universe. These Extraterrestrials are not like the flower children in CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND or the space cowboys of STAR WARS. They are creatures whom we will judge to be possessed of magical powers when we see them. By bur standards they will be immortal and omnipotent. They are the kind of creatures who would be capable of a trip to the Earth from another star. OTHER SUNS How can these bizarre notions be supported by science? Here is the evidence. One hundred billion stars like the sun surround us in our galaxy alone, according to indirect but solid astronomical evidence; many have planets made up of the same ingredients as the Earth. These planets have water and air and the same structure for climate as that of the Earth. The molecules on their surfaces enter into the same chemical combinations, subject to the same laws of chemistry and physics, as molecules on our planet. All the necessary. elements for the evolution of life are present, simple unthinking life at first, and complex intelligent life later on. On the basis of these considerations, I believe that life is common on the many planetary systems in the Universe. Recent discoveries in astronomy prove that if life exists on other planets in the Universe, most of this life is far older than life on Earth. The discoveries relate to the so-called Big Bang theory, which holds that the Universe started with a huge explosion. The Big Bang theory has now been proved to be a fact by the Nobel Prize-winning work of ARNO PENZIAS and ROBERT WILSON, who discovered the remnant of the primordial flash of light and heat that filled the Universe at the time of the great explosion. In other words, they discovered a relic of events that actually took place shortly after the beginning of the world. Although many astronomers had resisted the Big Bang theory, the PENZIAS-WILSON discovery has convinced most of them. BIG BANG The importance of the Big Bang in a discussion of UFOs and life on other worlds is that it tells us when the world began, it tells us the age of the Universe. An astronomer can calculate on the back of an envelope how long ago the Big Bang occurred. That moment marked the birth of the Universe. The result of the calculation is that the Universe came into being 20 billion years ago. The Earth, on the other hand, was born only 4.6 billion years ago. That result comes from measurements of the ages of meteorites arid from the ages of the rocks brought back by Apollo astronauts. Since meteorites and the moon are relatively unchanged samples of solar-system material, dating back to the birth of the planets, their age is thought to give a good estimate of the age of the Earth.. Thus many planets circling distant stars are 5, 10 and even 15 billion years older than the Earth. It follows that the Earth is a very recent arrival in the cosmic family of planets, and man is among the youngest citizens of the Universe. Of course, the fact that life elsewhere is older than man does not necessarily mean that this life is more intelligent. However, the scientific evidence suggests that this is likely to be the case. Throughout the last 300 million years of life on Earth, only one seemingly universal trend can be discerned in evolution, and this is the trend towards greater .intelligence. Since before the fishes left the water, the most intelligent form of life present on Earth in each era has been the rootstock out of which new and still more intelligent forms have evolved. The line of increasing intelligence stretches unbroken from the fishes to the reptiles to the mammals, the primates and man. Apparently, intelligence which permits a flexible response to changing conditions, has a greater survival value than any other single trait. Now we come to a critical point. Why would a line of evolution that has proceeded unchecked for hundreds of millions of years stop at the particular level of intelligence that we call \"human\"? Homo Erectus had less brain power than Homosapiens has, the successors to Homosapiens should have more. If the past is any guide to the future, our descendants a billion years from now will surpass us in intelligence. And if the Earth is typical of planets in the universe (and everything we know in astronomy and geology tells us that it is), intelligent beings who live on planets billions of years older than the Earth have already reached that advanced level of intelligence that our successors will only achieve in the distant future. This argument, proceeding step by step on the basis of evidence acquired in the basic scientific disciplines, leads to the conclusion that life on Other worlds is not only billions of years older than man, but also billions of years beyond him in intelligence.

KEY TO DIAGRAM E-T CONTACT, Continued planets a billion years older than the Earth must possess an intelligence that surpasses us by as much as we surpass the worm. These considerations bring me full circle to my opening statement. According to the best scientific evidence, intelligent life on other worlds is likelyJo be as far beyond man as man is beyond the worm. Why is it so important, in a discussion of UFOs, to establish a scientific foundation for the existence of races more intelligent than man? The answer is related to the fact that the distances between the stars are so enormously great. If a UFO reaches Earth, its crew must have covered those enormous distances somehow. They must have started out from someplace beyond the edge of our solar system. They cannot come from the Earth's sister planets, because no intelligent life exists in this solar system except on our own planet. All the evidence acquired by NASA spacecraft in the past few years regarding Venus, Mars and Jupiter points to that conclusion. It follows that UFOs, if they arrive here, have come from another star. The closest star to the sun is 25 trillion miles away, and it would take one million years to cover that enormous distance with the fastest rockets known to man. Our science and engineering are not adequate to meet that challenge: a trip to the stars is beyond our reach at the present time. But in another billion years, our descendants, possessed of highly evolved minds and with science and engineering far beyond ours, should be able to undertake an interstellar voyage. And what our descendants can do a billion years in the future, other races, a billion years older and more evolved than man, should be able to do today. My conclusion is that UFOs, visitors from another star, is a scientifically sound concept because science tells us that it is reasonable to believe in the existence of forms of life older and far more intelligent than man. PREVIOUS VISITS? Has the Earth already been visited by these older more advanced beings? According to some scientists the Bible tells of these visits. Numerous books have appeared telling of visits from these beings throughout the history of mankind. Are such visits occurring at the moment? Dr. J. Allen Hynek is one of many eminent scientists who have made a study of reported UFO sightings and concludes that several are unmistakably UFOs (Unidentified Flying Objects). He cannot say whether these unidentified objects have come from another star, but there are good reasons for believing that such extraterrestrial contacts, either visitors or messengers, are more probable (continued on page 17) 11"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"BLUEPRINT FOR PROGRESS By Richard Hall In the spirit of other recent analyses of the State-of-the-Art, I offer the following remarks about the status, goals, and future outlook for \"UFOlogy\". They may seem radical, and surely will offend some people, but we must face up to reality if we ever hope to get anywhere. First of all, we must recognize that \"UFOlogy\" is a contradiction in terms — there is no \"science\" of UFO investigation and research. There are many small and a few large UFO groups, some of which have a smattering of scientists as members, and whatever \"science\" they apply is at best — spare time, sporadic, and unsystematic. Instead of talking about improving or expanding \"UFOlogy\" we should talk about establishing it in the first place! As it stands, UFOlogy is a pretense — a fiction. Only when qualified scientists are funded to do systematic research will there be a UFOlogy. On the other hand, a few UFO groups (notably MUFON andCUFOS) do operate in a scientific spirit and attempt to bring scientific resources to bear on the UFO problem, but with the limitations cited above. Basically, that means applying thorough investigative procedures, carefully sifting evidence and weeding out IFOs and hoaxes, and using logic and reason to try to make sense of what is going on. However, resources are woefully lacking and no matter how well-intentioned such efforts are they amount only to stop- gap actions pending real, large-scale scientific investigation. Some very good work is being accomplished, but then the results typically never are read by anyone other than members of- the in-group. UFO ZOO We also must learn to see ourselves as others see us — especially significant others. Frankly, it is extremely doubtful that important people and opinion-makers in society (more on them later) see us at all, and if 12 so they .are not likely to be able to differentiate us from crackpots and mystics. All of this underlines the importance of the outreach effort being undertaken by Marge Christensen and her colleagues. By now it should be obvious that the UFO movement speaks with a cacaphony of voices to the public at large, and we end up sounding pretty silly. Just scan through a sample of UFO publications and you will find fundamentalist religious views, mystical and occult themes, automatic assumptions that UFOs are related to every other mystery under the sun, and all sorts of ranting and raving, sometimes including deliberate, conscious efforts to muddle things up worse than they already are by certain people who function effectively .as disinformation specialists. Then there are the egomaniacs who must be big wheels, have titles, and run their own splinter groups; they typically find it necessary to take potshots at the larger, better established groups in order to carve out a niche for themselves. When some potentially important UFO news breaks, none of this is lost on the news media or other significant segments of society because the cranks, mystics, and axe-grinders swarm out of the woodwork and talk loudest of all. Since some of them are \"colorful,\" they are also \"newsworthy\" to a certain breed of alleged journalists who seek only color arid controversy. The general perception on the UFO subject (the existing bias) is that it is much ado about nothing; only fantasy spread by \"believers\" and wishful thinkers. Thus, many journalists probably feel that they are only reporting things as they really are when • they seize on non-sensical aspects of the subject. THE ENEMY On the whole, would-be UFOlogists do a very poor job of public relations and end up talking only to themselves, aiding and abetting the biases against the subject, and engaging in a lot of pretense. In the famous words of Pogo, \"We have met the enemy and he is us!\" Skeptics are not our real enemies; they can perform an important function, and in any event we have ample information to deal with them if we use it effectively. News media are not our enemies; they should be our natural allies, and we have failed to understand the needs of the press and how to work with them. Nor is the Government our enemy; though some policy-makers (in our view) have erred on the side of secrecy, many people in Government take UFOs seriously and would like to see an open, scientific study. No, Pogo was right. We (collectively) are the enemy, and we must police pur own ranks. To get a handle on the problem, we must ask ourselves, \"Who are we trying to convince? Who should be reading our information that isn't doing so now?\" Unless we are naive enough to believe that the existing rag-tag army of UFOlogists can go it alone and don't need any help, we must have someone — some groups — in mind that we would like to have on our side. I suggest that the prime movers and shakers, the major opinion-makers in our society, are: , • Members of Congress • Other Government officials . • News media • Scientists/scientific organiza- tions • Universities/research centers These should be the targets of our efforts, but — the manner of approach is vital to success, and it cannot be chaotic and disorganized. As a first order of business, these target groups must be made aware that the crackpots, mystics, and opportunitsts (continued next page)"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"BLUEPRINT, Continued are not representative of the core UFO problem, and furthermore that we totally disown them and find their actions and ideas reprehensible. Positive Differentiation from the cacaphony of voices is essential. CONGRESS For the past five years in my professional work, I have read and abstracted Congressional hearing testimony on a daily basis. The testimony, covers issues large and small, some life or death matters and many affecting citizens everywhere (e.g., \"Star Wars,\" Defense Department budgets, social security, aviation safety).     <• safety). Witnesses appear and testify on every conceivable facet of each issue, pro and con. The arguments are complex and intricate. The busy Members of Congress must listen to warring voices of all kinds and every shade of opinion, and digest what they hear in order to construct legislation or cast a vote. How do they manage to do this with long lines of interested or affected parties lined up to testify? Three of their basic techniques are relevant here: 1) they confine oral testimony to a brief summary statement and question-and- answer period while placing the longer written testimony in the hearing record for reference; 2) they encourage associations and organizations to pool resources and have one spokesperson; and 3) they commonly require witnesses to appear together as a panel rather than one by one, to speed things along and get to the core of the issue as efficiently as possible. LESSONS There are several lessons in this, the following chief among them: If you want to get the attention of important and busy people, be organized, concise, to the point, and document your statements. Congressional hearing records nearly always include many pages of documents. If your argument or statement is unfocused or rambling, the Congressman's eyes will quickly glaze over. Where you have common ground with other individuals and/or groups, work together with them and make one unified approach to the person you are seeking to persuade. Make a clear, logical, coherent case and demonstrate that the views you are presenting represent those of the many people in the common group. Larger numbers of people agreeing on issues and speaking with one voice can be much more persuasive then separate communica- tions from each of the individuals, which are likely to be idiosyncratic and to blur the focus. By the same token, it also makes sense to select as a spokesperson someone who is literate and articulate. TOO MANY VOICES Considering every youngster from each new generation who jumps into the fray, all the egomaniacs, the mystics, the opportunists, and the crackpots, there are far too many voices in UFOlogy, and all too many of them uninformed or discordant. Not much can be done about that, except to make it absolutely clear that they do not represent UFOlogy, and to work toward an organized voice for UFOlogy that can be recognized as such and will be respected and heeded. That requires strong scientific and ethical standards, among other things. It does not require a Supergroup; only cooperation among all who hold to the principles and spirit of science. A blueprint for progress in UFOlogy, then, as a minimum involves the following elements: • Self-realization, that UFOlogy as presently constructed is not a science, but a stop-gap effort by intelligent and well-meaning citizens to bring the UFO problem to the attention of people with the ability and resources to do something about it. • Positive differentiation, to articulate clearly that the loudest and most commonly heard voices are not necessarily representative of the real problem and that (in specified instances) we don't agree with them and reject their views. • Sophistication, including recognition of who our real \"enemies\" and (potential) \"allies\" are and how to deal with them. • Scientific spirit, particularly focusing on truly objective and thorough investigation, documenta- tion, and scholarship, and the careful use of logic and reason to support our arguments. • Self-policing, including public rebuke of alleged \"UFOlogists\" who engage in ego-building self promotion, specious logic, unscientific claims, loose thinking, and the many other destructive behaviors evident in the UFO literature which tend to demean UFO research. \"UFOlogy\" really is a very mixed bag of people who, for good and bad reasons, would like to convince the world that UFOs are something important and deserving of serious attention. Some have ulterior motives and wish to see their ideas prevail; others are convinced that science ought to look into the problem far more thoroughly than they have to date. This, in fact, is the dichotomy that needs to be made: between those who think they already have the answer and those who perceive UFOs as a scientific problem badly in need of systematic, thorough, and well-funded investiga- tion. I think I already know the answer, but I identify myself with the latter group. What you think you know is a hypothesis; then you need to test that hypothesis — and others — in order to determine the truth.

We have, surprisingly, added a lot of interesting data to the statistics of twenty years ago. I am still very impressed with THE UFO EVIDENCE as a basic research tool and feel it is a must for all ufologists. For those who might think that not too much has been accomplished in the last two decades in the subject of UFOs, I have done a little research of my own. I think you will find this useful if you are doing any PR work. Most people are now more conditioned to be receptive to special evidence cases and cases of high- strangeness (provided there is some believability), rather than just lights in the sky reports. In this area we have come a long way. In 1964, UFO EVIDENCE cited 35 cases of physical evidence. This was covering the entire spectrum of physical & physiological evidence and not what we term \"trace cases\". The 1981 MUFON Symposium presented Ted Phillip's trace case study which was classified as close encounters of the 2nd kind and represented a catalog of 2,108 events under that heading. Quite an advancement. Regardless of all the inherent technical data & conclusions, the collection alone was a hell of an achievement. In 1980, the Center for UFO Studies put out a computer printout of 5,633 entries. RADAR In the area of radar cases, UFO EVIDENCE listed 81 cases. This was very impressive. I personally xeroxed copies of the reports themselves, found in the open literature and found another 18 cases. I'm sure there are many more since then. I believe and hope someone undertakes the project of radar case studies and think these cases are very significant and 14 neglected. I found some interesting . data in the old Air Force statistics of 1953 in regard to radar reports. Captain Ruppelt stated that there were 429 Unknowns and that 10% were radar cases. That's 42 cases! In the 701 'unknowns\" that the Air Force ended up with in 1969, there were less than 20 reports of radar cases. In my MADAR research (Multiple Anomaly Detection & Automated Recording) I am very especially interested in E-M cases. NICAP listed 106 cases in 1964. Rodeghier published his report through the Center for UFO Studies, .entitled \"UFO Reports Involving Vehicle Interference\" in 1981. There were now 441 documented cases on record. PHOTOGRAPHS In the area of photography and pictures of alleged UFOs NICAP listed 64 cases of either still photos or motion picture filmstrips. Since then Ground Saucer Watch has studied over 600 such items and found about 30 to be authentic as analyzed by their computer. I do not understand the technical aspects or form an opinion as to the remaining 30 to say whether there are more authentic cases or not, but I am impressed that someone is studying 600 photos. An area of high significance exists in the abduction reports or close encounters of the 4th kind. A project to catalog these cases has been funded by the Fund for UFO Research. Without the aid of a computer and someone to keep it updated, the report will not reflect the total cases on record, but illustrates the high number of CE4's in the open literature. Dr. Leo Sprinkle believes that one out of four people have been abducted! Budd Hopkins has found a considerable number of abduction cases. According to David Webb in his report, \"1973-YEAR OF THE HUMANOIDS\", there were 70 documented cases of humanoid reports during the fall of that year alone. Six of these were CE4's or missing time/abduction cases. Some reports that always impressed me were the reports by pilots and aviation experts. NICAP's UFO EVIDENCE listed 118 cases. Dr. Richard Haines has over 3,000 cases on . computer. Ninety percent were observed by more than one witness; 85% for more than 1-minute. The data base covers 40 countries. In his \"Review of Selected Sightings From Aircraft\", Dr. Hain'es studies 72 cases covering the period 1973-1978. Seventy-two point two percent were from commercial a/c, 19.5% private, and 8.3% military. In the study for the period 1942-1952, 283 cases were selected and 68% were military a/c, 20% commercial, 11% private. (1% unspecified). Twenty-nine cases involved E-M effects. For those skeptics that think the lights in the sky are simply all conventional objects viewed under unusual conditions by untrained observers, the old UFO EVIDENCE cites just a fraction (17 years of data compared to 38 years) of the now overwhelming evidence for intelligent. control of these objects. In 47 cases there was inquisitiveness & reaction to observers, 59 cases .of UFOs in geometrical formation with 26 listed as satellite object cases (mothership- types). Intelligent maneuvers themselves were represented in 100 cases with the oft-reported oscillation (wobble on axis) cited in 35 reports. Violent or erratic maneuvers were reported in 40 cases. Ballester's \"Close Encounter Cases, Catalog of 200 Type- 1 Events in Spain & Portugal\" (1976 report through the CUFOS) illustrates that objects within 200 feet of the ground are not rare at all and give the observer an excellent chance to observe a UFO at close range.

Short for her conscientious editing and publishing of the monthly UFO magazine SKYLOOK for over six years. Norma is credited for providing the publishing link for the fledgling Midwest UFO Network that ultimately became the world's largest UFO membership organization — the Mutual UFO Network. She will be remembered for her editorial policy \"We Tell It Like It Is.\" It is with profound gratitude that voluntary dedicated service may be honored in this manner to such a gracious lady. In 1967, Mrs. Norma E. Short was invited to become the editor of a new UFO newsletter that was to be named SKYLOOK. Being a former reporter for the Salem Post (Missouri) and a \"UFO buff,\" she enthusiastically accepted the challenge. The inaugural edition on September 1967 carried the motto: \"Let's Separate Fact from Fantasy.\" The founding staff consisted of John F. Kuhn, publisher; Mrs. Short, editor and Ted Phillips, Jr., assistant editor. The nucleus of subscribers came from members of the UFO Study Group of Greater St. Louis and theTri- State UFO Study Group (Quincy, Illinois). Norma became both publisher and editor in January 1969, necessitating the purchase of a mimeograph machine that she lovingly dubbed \"the monster.\" The staff in the February ,1968 masthead listed Ted Phillips, John Schuessler, Walter Andrus, Lucius Parish and Mrs. R.E. Holmes. The column \"In Others' Words\" by Lucius Parish was introduced in June 1969. The 24-page July 1969 edition announced that SKYLOOK had been named the official publication of the Midwest UFO Network (MUFON) with Allen R. Utke, Ph.D. as Director. \"A Message From Your Director\" column started in October 1970 when Walt Andrus was elected Director of MUFON.

In her final edition in January 1974, Mrs. Short had these words for her readers; \"Parting is such sweet sorrow . according to Mr. Shakespeare's Juliet — but I don't agree, as I come to the point where 1 have to announce this is Ye Ed's last issue of SKYLOOK. Parting is just...sorrow.\" Under Norma's six-year editorship, SKYLOOK earned the respect and reputation as one of the leading monthly UFO publications in the world. Norma had nurtured her \"child\" from a 5-page newletter to an \"adult,\" full fledged UFO magazine. In June 1976, the name was changed from SKYLOOK to the MUFON UFO JOURNAL to more adequately identify its contents, goals and purposes. SKYLOOK was published in Stover, Missouri; however, since retiring, Mrs. Short now resides at 723 McGrath Lane, Salem, MO 65560. RENDLESHAM, Continued Sgt. Yarborough is straight-as-an- arrow; a humorless career man who goes strictly by the rules. Doesn't look to the right or left. It was prudent to drop the subject there and then. Jenny makes quite a point that when the book was written (1983) no one remained on base who had been stationed there during the UFO events. A flow-chart analysis would automatically weed out this type of extraneous material. Dot named an American ufologist whom she understood is under contract-not only for a book on the Rendlesham Forest Affair, but also a dramatic film script. And Dot said that she and Jenny are seriously underway • with a follow-up book of their own on the case (Brenda has pretty much dropped out of things). It remains to be seen whether any of these endeavors clarify the Rendlesham Forest Affair. Meanwhile, without the cooperation of eyewitnesses, we are left with a jigsaw puzzle of unknown dimensions, no box- top picture, and a dreadful surmise t hat-while some pieces are missing, others, entirely irrelevant, have been scattered at out feet.

However, I find your publications even more informative when incorporated with other related newsletters; especially the Lucius Parish UFO Newsclipping Service in Arkansas. For instance: You published a report by Larry W. Bryant regarding the August 25, 1984 UFO Town-Hall Meeting in Brewster, New York (see Oct. 1984 Journal No. 198). A grand event, indeed. But several articles included in the \"Newsclipping Service\" enhanced it all. You became aware that the forum had captured wide media coverage in newspapers throughout the Northern East Coast. Reports showcased a historical perspective of the day's events, the speakers, their viewpoints and occupations and the vast amount of aerial sightings. It seemed as if I had actually attended the forum, met all the participants and experienced the vibrant atmosphere inside and out of the Henry Well's Middle School on that sunny August day. It should be imperative for any MUFON reader who hasn't yet subscribed to the UFO Newsclipping Service, to do so immediately; or else they will be missing out on a significant amount of up-to-the-minute information. Sincerely, Joan H. Laurino San Francisco, CA Dear Editor, May a mere subscriber take exception to the surfacing of James Oberg in your April issue? Not for a moment can we deny that rocket launchings have spurred various UFO reports, but neither can we deny that Mr. Oberg's commitment to the 16 anti-UFO position is total; that his NASA connection and general stature allow him almost instant national media access at the literal snap of a finger— a factor now denied those on the \"pro\" side. If you were going to be shot at sunrise would you help the firing squad load the rifles? Well, that's what you're doing by handing out a free platform to the all commanding professional debunkers. In a state of disbelief, I remain, Jack P. Swaney Las Vegas Of course a \"mere\" subscriber to the Journal can take exception to the appearance of James Oberg in its pages. Without such subscribers, mere or otherwise, obviously there would be no Journal in the first place! On the other hand, Oberg may take exception to your appearance, and then what's an editor to do? He or she hopefully does what this one does, and that is to present both sides of the argument. Like Oberg personally or, not, agree with his thought or not, it cannot be denied that his article, \"South American Uforia,\" contained valuable data, particularly the table of Soviet satellite launches, that helps us all separate the chaff from the wheat of ufology. And it was for that reason alone it was published. As editor, I don't particularly feel it's my duty to censor someone or some viewpoint before you, the reader, have the opportunity to weigh and respond yourself. In this particular instance, I think we've both done our job, and I appreciate your comments. -Editor Dear Editor, It is little wonder the general public, the news media and the scientific community give small credence to the numerous UFO sightings reported. In excess of half the verbiage published describing these events is devoted to provocative theories of extra-terrestrial, hollow earth dwellers or other esoteric origins of the phenomena, thus detracting from the prime motive of determining the individual parameters and character- istics of the objects involved. This approach to analysis provides a fertile field for the debunkers, who delight in attacking a theory which is obviously indefensible, particularly when the described event borders on the para-normal. Opposition to those who dissect some of these stories becomes difficult when the content sometimes approaches what you would expect to find in publications on the order of Fate Magazine. The logic demonstrated in James McCampbell's article (No. 189, November 1983) titled \"UFOs AND HOT RINGS\" is exemplary as the text adheres to known and accepted physical laws and illustrates a keen insight into the properties of UFOs. Particularly interesting are his references to the orientation of the rings relative to the field of radiation and the fact the skin was only burned under the rings. The article by Michael D. Swords, Ph.D. in the same issue titled \"COULD LOOKALIKE ASTRONAUTS BE CLONES\", although debunking in nature it should be read and heeded by most writers as it points up the fallacy of expounding a theory which is not based on factual evidence. His caution to \"do your homework\" is well taken. With the advent of computers and available and economical computer leasing time, all of the recorded UFO sightings and verification methods, placed in the appropriate time frames, could be categorized and published (see accompanying chart).

As far as we are concerned, their best effort was in the early 50's and the statistics then were not only more accurate, but revealing. Out of 1,593 cases, 429 were listed as \"unknown\", 26.94%. Insufficient Data reports totaled a whopping 22.72%. More information here could have meant more \"unknowns\". The Air Force always said that if they would have had more information, even the 26.94% would have been reduced! In actuality, Balloons listed as 18.51% were actually known as balloons in only 1.57% of the cases. Possible balloons 4.99 & probable 11.95%, and so on with Aircraft, Astronomical cases, etc. The real hard truth and the bottom line is this: Known Balloons, Aircraft, Astronomical cases 11.21% Possible  16.74 Probable  22.39 Insufficient Data?

The Air Force had 429 Unknowns in 6 years and during the next 17 years only 272 more Unknowns were added and most of the database in the early years were military cases. When Blue Book closed in 1969 they had 701 Unknowns on the books. The 1953 figures, more accurate when the Air Force took a serious role, showed that pilot reports constituted 17.1%. Scientists & engineers reported 5.7%, followed by Air Route Traffic Controllers at 1.0%. Radar cases represented 12.5%. Military & civilian cases, other than those just mentioned totaled the remaining 63.7%. Ruppelt stated that the Air Force assumed 1 out of 10 sightings was reported. This meant that from 1947 to 1953, 44,000 sightings were made in the US alone. Before you wonder where the 44,000 came from, Ruppelt stated that the Air Force had actually received 4,400 reports, but all except 1593 cases had been immediately rejected for the special analysis! He therefore extrapolated that there were over 39,000 not reported! One thing we can all agree on, where there is smoke there is usually fire. Where there is a lot of smoke, you had better dial 911! E-T CONTACT, Continued today than ever before in the history of our planet. Since about 1960, television stations across the Earth have been spraying their signals into space at a million-watt level. In the course of the last 20 years, that exploding shell of television signals, moving away from Earth at the speed of light, has travelled 240 trillion miles. It has now swept past 40 stars in the neighborhood of the sun. Early TV programs, moving away from the Earth at the speed of light, have carried the message to these stars that intelligent life exists on this planet. These television signals make the Earth the brightest radio star in our neighborhood of the galaxy of TV frequencies. For the first time in 4.6 million years, our planet is a notable object in the heavens. If any of these 40 nearby stars harbour intelligent beings, our presence is now known to them. As it took 20 years for our signals to reach these stars, it must take 20 years for their reply travelling at the same speed, to get back. Unless man is alone in the universe, we can expect to receive a message, or a visit by the end of this century (unless they have already arrived). And would these superior beings bother to talk to us? In their eyes Einstein would qualify as a waiter and Thomas Jefferson as a busybody. I think they would. They are jaded, they have lived a billion years, they have done nearly everything, they are eager .for fresh experiences. After all, where else in the universe have they seen a creature like man before?

A hard nosed \"nuts and bolts approach\" to the phenomena would go a long way toward gaining acceptance and the use of graphics could be extended to the analysis of landing site data, electromagnetic effects and observations of various propulsion variations recorded. Charts and graphs are a most effective way of presenting evidence and are more easily assimilated by the reader, especially those in the field of science. I am personally convinced UFOs are E.T. in origin, but equally sure we should attack the problems of what they are, where they appear, when and in what quantity, etc., before we attempt to theorize on their base of operations. Let us organize a truly investigative force and track down the facts, organizing and displaying them in a logical manner as a law enforcement agency would operate. After all, if you were being observed at various times and locations by a variety of unknown observers, your priorities would be to obtain the physical characteristics of your observers, the frequency of observation and the locales involved before becoming concerned with their place of residence. The credibility of UFOs is in our hands. Let us maximize the opportunity by presenting factual evidence in an orderly and easily assimilated manner. Such an effort could substantially reduce the existing credibility gap now facing us. Cliff Henderson, M.E.E. MUFON Research Specialist, Propulsion Systems Sunnyvale, Calif. MUFON 103 OLDTOWNE RD.

Originally classified TOP SECRET, it was declassified on March 5, 1985. Some of the UFO sightings reported are part of Edward J. Ruppelt's book The Report on Unidentified Flying Objects. In a letter dated 25 Sept 1950, the Dept of the Air Force Headquarters U.S. Air Force, ordered the destruction of Air Intelligence Report Number 100-203- 79. In order that the readers of the MUFON UFO JOURNAL may have access to this significant historical study, the majority of the July 1985 issue will be devoted to a reprint of the document. Some of the photographs of UFOs and flying wing aircraft in the report will not be reproduced due to the poor quality of the copying process by the U.S.A.F. By Walter N. Webb MUFON Astronomy Consultant UFO NEWSCLIPPING SERVICE The UFO NEWSCLIPPING SERVICE will keep you informed of all the latest United States and World-Wide UFO activity, as it happens! Our service was started in 1969, at which time we contracted with a reputable international newspaper-clipping bureau to obtain for us, those hard to find UFO reports (i.e., little known photographic cases, close encounter and landing reports, occupant cases) and all other UFO reports, many of which are carried only in small town or foreign newspapers. \"Our UFO Newsclipping Service issues are 20-page monthly reports, reproduced by photo-offset, containing the latest United States and Canadian UFO newsclippings, with our foreign section carrying the latest British, Australian, New Zealand and other foreign press reports. Also included is a 3-5 page section of \"Fortean\" clippings (i.e. Bigfoot and' other \"monster\" reports).

The yellow planet resumes its normal eastward motion in Libra on the 26th. Jupiter, still brightening in Capricornus, rises in the east-southeast about an hour after sunset in midmonth. The moon lies below the giant planet on the Fourth of July .and also on the 31st. Bright Planets (Morning Sky): Venus shines brilliantly low in the east during morning twilight, while Jupiter (3 } / 2 times fainter) illuminates the southwestern sky. The former rises about 2:30 AM in midmonth. .Venus appears 5° to the right of the crescent moon on the 14th and 3° above the orange star Aldebaran on the 15th. Meteor Shower: The July or Delta Aquarid meteors extend from about mid-July to mid-August. They peak on the morning of July 28 at a rate of about 20 per hour. Wait until the bright gibbous moon sets about 2 AM to begin observing that morning. Although the meteors appear to radiate from a point in Aquarius in the southern sky, the glowing streaks of light do not become visible until some distance away from the spot. Thus, the viewer should scan the whole sky for the relatively slow Aquarids which leave long paths across the heavens. Moon Phases: Full moon-July 2 Last quarter-July 9 New moon-July 17 First quarter-July 24 Full moon-July 31 The Stars: Note two full moons in one month. The second full moon is sometimes called a \"blue moon,\" a term derived from another unusual event when forest fire smoke may tinge the moon bluish. Hence, \"once in a blue moon.\" A double full moon occurs again in May 1988. The Summer Triangle is now well up in the eastern sky after twilight ends. The star in each corner of the triangle belongs to a separate constellation: Vega lies in Lyra the Harp, Deneb in Cygnus the Swan, and Altair in Aquila the Eagle. Below the triangle appears a heavenly hint of autumn-the Great Square of Pegasus. The constellations of spring-Leo, Bootes, Virgo, Libra-are slipping toward the western horizon. In the south, Scorpius crawls westward. This pattern is one of the easiest to spot, with head and curved claws to the west and curling tail to the east. The star Antares marks the red heart of the scorpion. In the north, the Big Dipper stands to the west or left of Polaris the North Star. Use the pointer stars in the dipper's bowl to locate Polaris. 18"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"MESSAGE, Continued David M.

Gersten, MUFON recently received a large number of U.S. Air Force documents declassified on January 29, 1985 under the Freedoms of Information Act (FO1A). Mr. Todd is to be commended for his diligent research on behalf of Citizens Against UFO Secrecy (CAUS) and for sharing his work with MUFON. Most of the documents are from the year of 1952. Also included is the 18 pages of. unclassified correspondence prompted by Chuck de Caro's inquiry into the Bentwaters AFB case of December 1980 when he was preparing the Cable News Network (CNN) Special Assignment Documentary. We will publish the series of questions and answers posed by Mr. de Caro and the answers the U.S.A.F. received from USAF Ramstein AB (Germany), RAF Bentwaters (England) and RAF Mildenhall (England) in a future issue of the Journal. However, a very significant report dated December 10,1948 was probably the source material for the now famous Estimate of the Situation, in which Project Sign personnel at A.T.I.C. declared in 1948 that \"UFOs were inter- planetary.\" This 26-page document is Air Intelligence Report No. 100-203-79, titled \"Analysis of Flying Objects in the U.S.,\" Air Intelligence Division Study No. 203, dated 10 December 1948 (by) (continued on page 18) 19"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"DIRECTOR'S MESSAGE by Walt Andrus The MUFON 1985 UFO Symposium in St. Louis, Missouri on June 28,29, and 30 will be remembered by the attendees as another successful conference when this issue reaches our readers in the far corners of the Earth.

The aims of ICUR shall be to promote, undertake and standardize the investigation and research on the UFO phenomenon on a global basis and in a scientific manner. It shall also be the task of the Committee to disseminate factual information on its workings to all interested parties. Starting in 1979, there has been interim activity taking place under the name of \"The Provisional Committee for UFO Research\" (PICUR). Dr. Michael Sinclair, MUFON International Coordinator, has been the MUFON representative at all of the meetings to date. Officers elected on August 26, 1983 at the annual meeting are Bertil Kuhlemann, (Sweden) Chairman; Bjarne Hakansson, (Sweden) Secretary; and Robert Digby (England) Treasurer. Peter A. Hill (Scotland) was the former chairman. The founding member organizations and their representatives at the August 1983 meeting in London, England were CUFOS/USA, J. Allen Hynek (President Emeritus of ICUR): SUFOI/ Denmark, Per Anderson; BUFORA/ England, Robert Dibgy; UFOCAN/ Canada, Stanton T. Friedman; Pro- ject URD/Sweden, Bertil Kuhlemann VUFORS/Australia (Victoria), Paul Norman; and MUFON/USA, Michael Sinclair. MUFON annual dues are based upon a member organization of between 1000 and 1999 members. MUFON elected to resign from the very unstable North American UFO Federation in August 1984 and will concentrate its efforts with the prestigious ICUR on an international scope. * * * We are extremely proud of Marge Christensen, Director of Public Relations and Massachusetts MUFON, Inc. for producing the UFO documentary for the Mutual UFO Network as a public relations function.

Arranged by Bill Moore, live interviews were conducted with people directly involved in the Roswell, New Mexico crash in 1947. Motion picture footage from the film \"UFOs Are Real\" was shown as well as interviews with some of the witnesses who previously participated in the MUFON 1983 UFO Symposium in Pasadena, Calif. The original plan was to show the MUFON UFO Hotline telephone number (512) 379-9216 on the screen when the program host announced \"where to report UFO sightings.\" A last minute change was made in the programing whereby the number was left out and viewers had no idea whatsoever where to report UFOs. While being interviewed, a credit appeared identifying \"William L. Moore, Mutual UFO Network.\" Everyone is reminded that July 1st is the deadline for submitting early registrations for the UFO Forum sponsored by Mass. MUFON on August 17 & 18 in Beverly, Mass.
