Interestingly, even some of those who emphasize plant and soil re- search, such as Nancy Talbott, have reported apparent physical and emo- tional effects from entering some of the circles. Results of Pringle's studies are not yet compiled for the 2004 UK season, but she and her colleagues have compiled studies of the 2003 season. Extensive charts have been developed which may be viewed on Ms. Pringle's website, http:// home.darajiet/lucypringle. Techniques for measuring effects on individuals are constantly being evaluated and modified, and it is dif- ficult to determine the extent to which psychological effects cause some of the reported and measured physical effects. The appearance on June 15,2003, of the glorious Ogbourne St George forma- tion that appeared two miles from any habitation ushered in the season for me. Its complex series of crescents spi- raled outwards in increasing size from a central circle, nestling snuggly beneath the Ridgeway in Wiltshire far from the prying eyes of man. The Ridgeway is Britain's oldest road, which during its 85-mile (137km) jour- ney passes many other historic sites as it winds it way through Wiltshire, Oxfordshire, Berkshire and Hertford- shire, starting at Avebury in Wiltshire and ending its peregrinations at Ivanhoe Bea- con in Hertfordshire. The Ogbourne St. George formation. Long-time researcher Christopher Weeks and I visited the formation on June 17, two days after its arrival. The farmer was loath to allow many people into the formation, as he did not wish his privacy invaded nor his field damaged. I drove my car as far as I could, and then the farmer kindly took us in his 4- wheel drive the rest of the way, bump- ing over deeply rutted terrain. For hu- mans to carry their equipment and walk over such an inaccessibly arduous and pitted tract of land seemed unlikely. We examined the formation in mi- nutely close detail, and at the end of an hour could find no evidence of human involvement. The stalks were not crushed or bro- ken, and the gray bloom that gives this early crop its bluish look was still present. There was no evidence of pole or other marks. The scene was unbelievably peace- ful; early summer at its best. Despite the circle being only 48 hours old, the young green wheat had clearly been only lightly kissed and was rising up fast. Before entering the circle we buried two pairs of bottles as control samples, and buried a series of pairs of bottles inside. Towards the end of this exercise, Christopher suddenly asked how many more bottles were to be buried, \"Only one more set,\" I replied. \"Thank good- ness for that,\" said Christopher, \"then I am getting out.\" I had not mentioned that I had also been feeling far from well for some time after entering the circle. A feeling of vague nausea, disorientation, headache, and just generally yuk. But our scientific research had to come first. As we walked back to my car we dis- cussed our symptoms, which were then fast disappearing. We decided that the vortical energy of the circle had been DECEMBER 2004 MUFON UFO JOURNAL"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"increased by a possible rebound of vor- tical energy from the steep banks of the Ridgeway, doubling the natural effect. By the time we reached my car, we were fully recovered. However, within 48 hours Christopher developed severe gout. This is not the first time it has happened to him after visiting crop circles. His gout recovered, we returned a week later to collect the bottles. Within 48 hours Christopher devel- oped gout once more. Causes of gout We know that gout occurs as a result of uric crystals collecting around joints, causing painful inflammation. It is some- times thought that an abundance of rich food and red wine or port can be the cause. Christopher does not drink wine and eats well, mainly organic foods. Three other people who visited the formation all felt extremely thirsty as they left. Instead of drinking the water.they had brought with them, they all craved red wine. Two of them had forgotten this effect when they revisited the formation at a later date. Unexpectedly, this effect was repeated. They are naturally moderate red wine drinkers, but this compulsion was some- thing different. Could there be a chemical constitu- ent that is common to both red wine and the cause of gout? Relating to red wine reports, it has been suggested to me that the exogenous stimulus was a \"kick\" to the reward centers of the brain, rather than a subconscious seeking of an in- gredient. The next question is the energy input. Eddy currents are now coming to the fore in physics when magnetic fields traverse the brain. Several years ago a young man sent me a report telling me that despite feel- ing slightly nauseous while inside a for- mation, he had desperately craved chocolate. Many people suffer from this condition. We are told that whereas chocolate craving is often linked to eat- ing disorders, there are other possible rea- sons. The main active ingredient of choco- late is cocoa, a significant source of the stimulant theobromine, which is a known Peter and Isabel measure Chris in the formation. mood elevator. In tests it has been shown that alcohol-loving rats, given the choice will actually replace their alcohol intake in preference for chocolate. By doing this the rats increase their level of dopamine, as chocolate appears to stimulate its production. A study of rats shows that dopamine kick-starts a brain messenger chemical called DARPP-32, which in rum activates hor- mones that make females interested in sex, hence Valentine Day chocolates. Researchers at the Neurosciences Institute in San Diego have also discov- ered that novel constituents in cocoa powder and chocolate are chemical cousins of anandamide, which binds to the same brain receptor sites as mari- juana. Chocolate and maryuana This means that chocolate chemicals may activate receptors for marijuana and thus mimic its psychoactive effects of heightened sensations and euphoria. What are the reasons for these strange cravings? Is there a dopamine link between chocolate and red wine? What about gout? When dealing with complex subtle energies, their effects on areas of the brain are still to be thor- oughly understood. We took seed samples from the cen- ter and perimeter of this formation, plus control samples from some distance out- side. These were sent to Jim Lyons in York for analysis. The results are inter- esting, and show significant differences between the two sample types: A change in protein levels Jim tells me, \"You will see a signifi- cant change in protein levels from the control, with the perimeter results show- ing interesting effects. On the Spectral charts they have managed to cover a broader range of frequencies than the previous year, and hence reveal more resonances. It is these results I am try- ing to put in order.\" He continues, \"One can clearly see, however, the differences in magnitude of reflectivity for the differing samples. At least the perimeter results here are consistent with the protein results.\" He adds, \"The bottom line is there is a very significant effect (greater than last time) on the samples, but with at first sight a surprise result indicating most change for the perimeter results. \"This does show, however, the dra- matic difference between the control and perimeter results. Despite the difficul- ties of getting these results, it has been a worthwhile exercise. We clearly need many more samples to pursue this in detail.\" Reports of abnormal menstrual cycles continue, and two women visiting the MUFON UFO Journal DECEMBER 2004"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"beautiful Catherine Wheel which ap- . peared at Windmill Hill on June 22 both suffered irregularities, one unexpectedly starting her period immediately after vis- iting the formation, the other finding her normally consistent menstrual cycle dis- rupted. Research team Our scientific research team of Isabel Maxwell-Cade and Peter Staples (brain activity), Sheila Partridge (standing in for Anne Srriithells on measured hormone levels), Dr. Roger Taylor (advanced Kirlian program), and Jim Lyons (dows- ing) gathered alongside our six human guinea pigs at Beckhampton on July 20 to conduct control tests in a barn kindly lent to us by David Hues. The chosen formation was the pen- tacle inside a circle with scimitars ex- tending beyond the outer perimeter. I had visited this formation on two previous occasions. On the first visit I had felt quite nauseous in the center, and made a mental note of this. The second occasion was when I took a group of Americans to visit it. Before entering I had mentioned that if at any time they felt unwell, they should leave the formation immediately. I was the one who had to leave, as the moment I went into the center I was overcome with such a feeling of nausea that I had to leave instantly. Some guide! I was reluctant to use this formation for our research, but it was the most re- cent, and I was also unaware at the time of a report later sent to me by Doreen Jenkinson, who has completed the Harry Oldfield course. The Oldfield procedure is not unlike the Best technique: in one hand the pa- tient holds an electrode attached to the machine that is set to a particular fre- quency or reading while a sound level meter (scanner) is passed over the chakra points in the body. Prior to starting the test, a zero read- ing has to be established-the normal range being between 10.0+/-6. Other settings need to be correctly adjusted, such as the ECG readings, which range from A to D. A sensitive probe is pressed against the ear lobe or foreman and a reading is taken. Doreen took two other women with her, Annabel and Sally, and even as far away as the outskirts of the field they could all feel the vibration of the forma- tion. On going into the formation they all had sensations described as \"light- headed, dizzy, and giddy,\" and found it was not easy to walk against the flow of the crop-\"like going against the tide: a dragging feeling, almost like we were meant to follow the flow.\" Annabel had more violent effects. She -had an immediate headache on arrival at the outskirts of the field, and felt a resistance to even entering the forma- tion. She nevertheless plucked up cour- age after asking \"silent permission\" to enter the formation. Using Harry Oldfield's Electro-Crys- tal clinical unit machine and a sound meter, Doreen Jenkinson scanned Annabel at the edge of the field and at the center of the formation, and then Annabel wandered off on her own. She felt extreme fatigue and after % hour felt she could no longer stay in the formation and wanted to leave. She had a pain in her left temple on leaving the circle, constriction in her throat, and con- striction in her solar plexus and heart chakra areas. Disorientation She ran out of the formation as fast as she could. She felt very disorientated and even tried to get into the wrong car. When the keys did not fit she thought the formation had interfered with her keys (a Uri Geller effect) before she realized that she was trying to get into the wrong car. She felt completely dis- orientated and feared for her sanity. Sally felt dizzy and had heart palpita- tions; her pulse raced, but she managed to stay inside the circle for an hour. Doreen felt light-headed, a bit spaced out, and dryness in the throat area, but stayed the whole hour without too many ill effects. On reflection, Doreen has decided that in the future she will take control readings far away from the formation in order to obtain more accurate readings, as she believes the energies from a for- mation can have far reaching effects. Doreen took readings at the exact central vortex of the circle. In both cases, Annabel and Sally showed a huge congested (blocked) area of energy at the Brow and Crown Chakras caused by the chakras spinning too fast. The energy field depleted slightly, and then \"swelled\" again towards the ground. The subjects were then handed a bag of \"grounding stones\" which they held for just three to five minutes. In this in- credibly short time, in both cases there were marked changes in their energy fields. From this experiment Doreen sug- gests that by carrying specific crystals within the energy field a degree of pro- tection could be afforded to maintain a balanced energy field, especially in for- mations where people are known to be experiencing bad effects. She feels it is up to the individual to try this out and find which particular crys- tal helps them, but recommends Clear Quartz, Smokey Quartz, Amethyst, and Rose Quartz, as knowledge gained in Electro-Crystal Therapy suggests that these crystals do in fact help to balance the upper chakras. In order to carry out dispassionate scientific research, none of the scientists nor the four guinea pigs except Jim Lyons had reason to expect the forma- tion would be anything but beneficial. I took the precaution of positioning the group in one of the scimitars away from the center. Unlike the normal scorching days we have usually experienced while conducting the tests, the day was cold and windy. Thankfully no one felt ill, but as Sheila Partridge (who had never been into a crop circle before) was measuring the hormone levels, she suddenly remarked that she thought all circles were supposed to be beneficial and \"from these results, I am not sure we should be here at all.\" Hormone changes On analyzing her results, Anne Smithells reported, \"There were signifi- cant changes to the hormone reading of all subjects in the test group. Previous crop circle readings have shown 'stressed' adrenal readings to improve after entering the circle. On this occa- sion, out of the seven test group subjects, three improved and three worsened. She adds, \"The significant hormone to have shown constant change was DECEMBER 2004 MUFON UFO JOURNAL"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"TSH (Thyroid Stimulating Hormone), which showed a lower reading after en- tering the circle in six of the seven cases. Thyroid hormones do not normally fluctuate easily. Other hormones that varied before and after entering the circle were estrogen and glucagen (Pan- creas), which increased and decreased in equal amounts. Melatonin was also affected.\" When I asked Annie about these re- sults, she said that it was medically un- heard of that thyroid levels could have altered so dramatically within such a short time scale of approximately 2-3 hours. Isobel Maxwell-Cade was the only person whose thyroid levels improved. Christopher Weeks was the most seri- ously affected. Dr. Roger Taylor measured the changes in area, spectral width, form, and noise of the Kirlian records. Taking the measurements so far apart in time was not ideal, he said. The Russians, who have done the most work in the field of Kirlian records, consider that changes often per cent would be significant. He found that whereas there was no significant change between his control tests and tests inside the formation, most people had marginally benefited from being inside the formation. But it is interesting how this contrasts with 2001. when both readings were taken in the barn. Here all except Linda changed in the negative direction, which I put down to fatigue after a long day in the field. Open air not the cause One might suppose that, on first go- ing out into the open air, a positive change would be expected. The results from 2002, however, argue against this, since there was a generally negative change on first going into the field outside the circle-albeit rather smaller than 2001. There was then little further change on going into the circle, except Annie M, who had the very positive change. Thus the positive changes found in 2003 on going into the circle seem to be related to the circle, and not to be merely a result of going into the fresh air. So in spite of Sheila's findings of nega- tive changes in certain areas, such as Illinois MUFON State Director David Marler, left, introduces Peter Dav- enport, director of the UFO Center, to an audience of about 80 enthusiasts at a special meeting of Illinois MUFON Oct. 2 in Edwardsvilie thyroid, my results suggest that the circle had an overall beneficial effect. In addition to these effects on people, we have also noted effects on equip- ment. On one occasion, Suzanne Taylor and her film crew accompanied me in order to do some interviews. It was a glori- ously warm, sunny day and we con- ducted an interview inside the formation. At one point, Allen Bransen's sound and camera system failed completely, only to work again when he moved to a dif- ferent spot inside the formation. As always I am profoundly grateful not only to all the scientists who have contributed to this pioneering research but also to the many people who have recognized the importance of this re- search, trusted me with their experi- ences, and gallantly filled in the ques- tionnaires and returned them to me. On a final cautionary note, I would like to remind people that if they do not feel well when visiting a crop circle, come out immediately. If you are pregnant or thinking of be- coming pregnant, it is not advisable to enter a formation. Also, due to the many electrical failures experienced inside the circles, if you have a health device pow- ered by a battery, such as a heart pace- maker, do NOT venture in. Invisible comets could pose serious threat Comets that are invisible to astrono- mers could pose a lethal threat from space, scientists said recently. They be- lieve that giant \"stealth\" comets made up of loose material reflect so little light that they cannot be seen. If the theory is right, the chance of the Earth being hit by a comet big enough to wipe out human civilization may be higher than experts believe. Professor Chandra Wickramasinghe, head of the team at Cardiff University's Centre for Astrobiology, which delivered the warning, said: \"It's possible we need to think again about mitigating strate- gies,\" but noted that NASA has a new weapon with the power to \"de-cloak\" stealth comets.

Dear Editor: As a professional writer and editor and a member of MUFON for more than ten years, I am becoming increasingly dismayed by the content of the MUFON UFO Journal. The last two issues of the Journal, with a large number of pages devoted to the \"Raechel's Eyes\" story featuring an astounding claim of an \"apparent alien hybrid\" restoring the sight of a blind woman, and Beverly Trout's two-part discussion of the \"reptile perspective,\" are especially questionable. Let me state first of all that I believe the abduction phenomena is real. Fur- ther, I believe that the United States gov- ernment is aware of an alien presence on our planet and that it is engaged in an active disinformation campaign. But, while I am not a scientist and cer- tainly don't see myself as someone quali- fied to be an objective investigator, it's clear to me that the \"Raechel's.Eyes\" story is full of holes at least a mile wide. First of all, there is virtually no men- tion by investigator Jean Bilodeaux of verification of the claims made by the mother of the now deceased young woman beyond checking college tran- scripts (there was a \"Raechel\" found) and interviewing former classmates who verified that the young woman had an \"otherworldly roommate.\" With all due respect, I had some \"otherwordly\" roommates of my own during my college years. The investigator makes no mention (which I find incredible) of whether or not she even tried to verify the mother's claims of the restoration of her daughter's sight. I would think that the sudden and in- explicable restoration of sight would be a phenomenon of no small order, and that voluminous medical documentation of this miracle would be easily found. But instead of offering any proof of this astonishing assertion, she devotes the majority of her articles to a recital of the mother's claims, much of it recov- ered under hypnotic regression. While this is all very interesting, it doesn't come even remotely close to offering any proof of the story's verac- ity. Is the \"Raechel's Eyes\" story real? It may well be, but the author and editor's choice of focusing on the \"woo-woo\" aspects of the story and not on any hard line investigating that may or may not have been done certainly doesn't give me any basis on which to judge. Even more disturbing to me, however, is the reference in the second article's accompanying Editor's Note to the ad in that same issue offering the \"Raechel's Eyes\" book for sale at the incredible \"MUFON Special\" price of $45. Frankly, this violates every tenet of editorial-advertising separation in exist- ence, and certainly offers anyone suspi- cious of the editor's motives in choosing to feature these articles so prominently more than a little food for thought. With regard to Beverly Trout's musings on the reptile perspective, while I found it thought provoking, it ultimately amounts to nothing more than the rankest speculation and, when added to the ex- tremely shaky \"Raechel's Eyes\" story and a short article headlined \"Kentucky Professor Says Extraterrestrials Are Here,\" convinces me more than ever that the MUFONJournal\\\\2& lost its focus. With the exception of Stan Friedman's always interesting observations and \"Fil- ers Files,\" the Journal seems to me to be heading further.and further into tab- loid territory and further and further away from what it's designed to be: The flag- ship publication of the organization dedi- cated to the scientific study of the UFO phenomena. -Sandy Coleman Editor's reply: Dear Sandy, Thanks for your comments re Raechel's Eyes and the article on reptil- ians. I am in the process of contacting the author of Raechel's eyes. The announcement that a book is available to Journal readers was made so that those interested in more detailed information could buy the book if they wanted to, something we would do for any article. MUFON was not selling the book, and gets no commission on any sales. The \"special price\" to MUFON members was the publisher's offer, and we just passed it on. As for the reptilians, they seem to be very much a part of testimonies by many abductees, and thus part of the total UFO picture. While it would be nice to have groundbreaking news on this topic-as with other aspects of ufology-we have to go with what is currently available. Bev Trout, MUFON's director for Iowa, is a very reliable investigator. Response: Dwight, I very much appreciate your thought- ful reply. Believe me, I more than un- derstand your need for material and the fact that you' ve got to go with what you have. But I remain very disturbed by the Raechel's Eyes piece. The author pro- vided absolutely no proof of any of her assertions or even evidence of her at- tempt to verify the most astonishing claim of all-the restoration of eyesight to a hopelessly blind young woman and with- out it, her piece should have not been accepted. If the proper investigative work was done, I would have to believe she would be more than willing to revise. If not, then her refusal, as well, would speak vol- umes. 8 MUFON UFO Journal DECEMBER 2004"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"Further, by offering the book for sale in the editorial pages of the Journal, it certainly appears to me to be a MUFON endorsement of the story- something I think you should be very reluctant to do.

I also agree that the reptillian piece was very interesting and Bev Trout is a woman with a great deal of credibility.

Raechel's Eyes had been submitted to the publisher more than five years earlier with no mention of a publishing date. Had I known it was going to be published, I would have informed you of this fact and left the decision of whether you wanted to print the articles up to you. I also would have written the articles a bit differently to make them sound more exciting. I am sorry if this coinci- dence reflected poorly on your or my pro- fessionalism. The writer seems to have missed the sentences that stated the articles were just a \"minute portion of the investiga- tion and that the \"investigation contin- ues.\" Perhaps my \"dwelling\" on the \"woo- woo\" aspects of the investigation in the article, was an editorial error on my part. I thought it was interesting, as I had never seen a regression before, and it wasn't nearly as \"woo-woo\" as I had been led to believe by watching TV. It was mainly just hard work. Many names of people, from Marisa's college years were recalled during these sessions and subsequently investigated. Perhaps I could be so bold as to suggest the writer read the book so as to assure him(her)self that hard line investigating was done. As for obtaining the voluminous medi- cal documentation that must have oc- curred with the sudden restoration of Marisa's sight-this is not the movies. The federal government enforces the HTPA act, which insures patient privacy and forbids the release of any patient medical records to people other than the patient's physician or under subpoena by law officers. I could not obtain Marisa's medical records, nor could her mother. Instead I had to rely on the testimony of Marisa's mother, brother, husband, roommates and friends. Except for her mother, none of the others knew of the investigation-only that I was writing about her life. If the writer has any other ideas on how to le- gally obtain Marisa's medical records, please let me know and I'll try. BTW, the doctor is no longer in practice. Of course almost all of us have had \"other-worldly\" roommates, but time and maturity modifies our perceptions of those different than ourselves. This did not occur with the remembrances of Raechel. Twenty-five years ago I didn't know much about UFOs, had never heard of abductions, missing time, cattle mutila- tions, or crop circles. After investigating more than 200 UFO sightings, 20+ cattle mutilations, three crop circles and sev- eral possible abductions, I can only say one thing for sure-there are unexplained things happening in the world today. The subject of reptilians makes me uneasy, just as the discussion of abduc- tions and cattle mutilations did in the past. Yet I've heard very credible sounding people talk about their experiences with these creatures. I' ve learned that just because some- thing doesn't fit into my \"reality box,\" doesn't mean it doesn't exist or isn't con- nected in some way to UFOs. I wasn't comfortable with \"hybrids,\" etc. when I started investigating Raechel's Eyes; however, as you stated, science has now brought this process within the realm of reality. Bev Trout is breaking new ground by bringing this to the public's attention. Only time and more research will validate or invalidate her findings. I applaud MUFON and you for al- lowing the examination and discussion of topics unexplained yet seemingly re- lated to the UFO phenomenon. None of us can definitively prove or disprove much of anything in this genre. I have never said that I could prove unequivocally that Raechel was an alien/ human hybrid. You said \"Apparent\" in each of the articles, and I agree. If I could prove it, I'd be on the cover of Time or Newsweek. I can only put my pieces of the puzzle on the table (your Journal) in hopes that someone will come forward with more pieces, and that ultimately the whole pic- ture will be revealed. For this opportu- nity, I thank you. -Jean Bilodeaux Missouri director Widaman teaching UFO courses Bruce Widaman, MUFON's longtime state director for Missouri, is teaching UFO courses at the St.Charles County Community CoUege.

DECEMBER 2004 MUFON UFO JOURNAL"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"MorningstarPass, The Collapse of the UFO Coverup, by Victor Norgarde,2003. 1st Books Library, Bloomington,IN,ISBN 1-4140-1909-2, 6x9, soft cover, 711 pages. Reviewed by Dwight Connelly This is a fiction book based on the UFO phenomenon, and one that is both challenging and rewarding to read. The author, who is .writing under a pen name, \"served in se.veral theatres of the Cold War,\" and is \"a trained scientist\" who works in the aerospace field while writing and teaching in the Southeast. Two things are clear in this book: Norgarde is a good writer, and he gives every indication of knowing what he is talking about. The numerous characters in this book are well developed, and the narration moves along nicely. The story focuses on two females in- volved with television news, Cassandra Chen and Pamela Monroe, who play key roles in the unfolding confrontation be- tween humans and aliens as a govern- ment cover-up unravels. But ranchers, the military, politicians, and undercover operatives are other key players.  ; Since there are so many characters, and since the story moves from place to place and character to character so of- ten, it would have been very helpful to have had a list and brief description of each character in a separate section of the book so that the reader could keep better track of them. This is especially important because of the length of the book-more than 700 pages. And these 700 pages are not filled with the relatively large type you 10 are now reading, but with smaller type. I doubt that few, if any, readers will com- plete this book in one or two sittings, despite its ability to keep the reader fully involved. In a book so well written, it is surpris- ing that the proofreading is so terrible. Following is one of the many ex- amples of poor sentence construction: \"He stepped up to the desk as she up a stethoscope in the ears, he rolled up his right shirt sleeve, a bandage covered a ball of cotton pressed onto his arm.\" Or this: \"Their has been not detect- able aerial activity near hear, only three more cattle found cut up to the East near Khaborsk this morning.\" Unfortunately, these are not isolated examples. Similar poor sentence con- struction and consistent misspellings are found throughout the book, and this no- ticeably interferes with the reading. Mr. Norgarde, who is embarrassed by the poor proofreading, assures me that this will be corrected in future printings. Despite its annoying errors, this novel is the first attempt by anyone to exam- ine an end-of-the-cover-up scenario in the context of the whole UFO phenom- enon, including its darker aspects of ab- duction, mutilations, and extra-constitu- tional government conduct. It is precisely these latter aspects of the UFO phenomenon that make disclo- sure so fraught with difficulty for the government, and the book confronts these issues head on. The reader sees the effects of the cover-up from many different perspec- tives, and is forced to view all aspects of the phenomenon. Thus I would especially recommend this book for those who are fascinated with the possibilities of a government cover-up. Morningstar Pass will keep you in suspense-and perhaps even frighten you as the plot unfolds.

Reviewed by James Neff I was fortunate enough to see a rough cut of the forth- coming Graviton Productions \"Dan Aykroyd-Un- plugged On UFOs.\" Aykroyd, long known to be a free-thinker and proponent of UFO reality (in addition to excel- lent actor and famous improvisational co- median) really weaves a mind boggling thread or two in this fascinating, highly charged interview conducted by David Sereda. Definitely not just for the eggheads, you'll find yourself hearing about and understanding cutting edge issues of quantum physics which are now practi- cally inextricable from the UFO phenom r enon, and which must be faced if we plan to step gracefully into the 21 st cen- tury mind-culture on the issue of extra- terrestrial visitation, as well as earth- bound endeavors in the race to discover anti-gravity propulsion. Do we already have this technology? And if yes, is it the result of back engi- neered alien recovery from crashes or intercepts? Sereda and Aykroyd exam- ine the present state of affairs, geopo- litically and scientifically, including a very interesting discussion of The Hutchison Effect, with several remarkable film ex- amples of antigravity in action. Aykroyd displays an encyclopedic knowledge of both physics and UFO his- tory/culture, and bends thoughts and pos- sibilities in ways only he could do, and at times with an uncomfortable (even to DECEMBER 2004"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"Dan!) sense of dark humor for which he is world renown. Who are they? What are they? Why are they here? How do they come and go? Are we their future lunch? Sereda masterfully intrigues Aykroyd with all the right elements, and Dan just pours forth an unabashed, intellectually inspiring examination of the big issues in UFOlogy like a seasoned professor. There's not a dull moment in this superb interview which is interspaced with fas- cinating UFO footage and visuals. Aykroyd comes across as an old soul, with insights and understanding of truly Renaissance proportions. There is even a shocking personal revelation and ex- perience as told by Aykroyd that will leave you with the hair standing up on the back of your neck! But you'll have to see the DVD to find out what that's allabout. No spoiler here. But believe me, it's quite a remark- able encounter with forces we'd just as soon pretend don't exist in order to sleep at night. To hear it from Dan's own mouth makes it all the more riveting and convincing. This DVD will make you think, and you'll find yourself rolling the conversa- tion over in your mind many days after you've put it back in the case. A definite must-have for any serious UFOlogical library. . /Thanks to Pat Uskert and Graviton for the sneak peak!

Clear view of UFO and beam of light reported by South Carolina couple This case, from Ocbnee County, SC, involved a man and his wife, and oc- curred in.1971 or 1972. It was investi- gated by George Fawcett, and submit- ted to the Journal^ George Lund, SD, NC. Following is the wife's account of the sighting: \"The actual year and month of the sighting are, as with time, somewhat hazy. I'm not certain whether it was in the year 1971 or 72. Nor do I remember the exact month. We were living in a rural area near Salem, SC. \"My husband worked at Oconee Nuclear Station, and I was a stay-at- home mother of one or two children, and expecting another. I can't remember if I was expecting my second or third child, because they are only 13 months apart. \"I was in the living room when my husband called to me to come out on the front porch. It was not yet dusk. I could see everything as plain as day. He said, look at this! I looked across the road, and hovering just above the ground in the field was a silver-gray saucer-shaped object. It didn't make a sound, but we felt its vibrations. \"I don't remember seeing the beam of light on it at that time. I can't remem- ber it actually moving. But later I knew it must have in order for me to have seen the light that came from underneath the middle of the object. The light seemed to have moved at least 150 feet. \"The field where I first caught sight of the object was on a hill. Going down the hill were trees and a small creek that my daughter and I would frequently visit, and normally could not be seen from our front porch. \"When watching this object with the beam of light magnifying everything be- low, I became very frightened for my children and myself. I told my husband that I was concerned for our safety, and started to go into the house. \"My husband asked me to stay for a few more minutes. I stayed until the ob- ject just wasn't there any longer. It was there, then it wasn't. \"I wouldn't say it vanished, just that it moved very very fast. The actual sight- ing lasted about 20 minutes.\" Estate Planning Planned giving can be beneficial both to MUFON and to your own tax and estate situation.

DECEMBER 2004 MUFON UFO JOURNAL 11"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"Anthropologists say new species of human found in Indonesia NewScientist.com news service The remains of a tiny and hitherto unknown species of human that lived as recently as 13,000 years ago have been discovered on an Indonesian island. The discovery has been heralded as the most important paleoanthro-pological find for 50 years, and has radically al- tered the accepted picture of human evolution. The skull and bones of one adult fe- male, and fragments from up to six other specimens, were found in the Liang Bua limestone caves on Flores Island, which lies at the eastern tip of Java. The female skeleton, known as LB1- or by the nickname \"Ebu\"-has been as- signed to a new species within the ge- nus Homo-Homofloresiensis. Exami- nation of the remains shows members of the species stood just one meter (about three feet) tall and had a brain no bigger than a grapefruit. A handful of stone tools from the same period were also found in the caves, along with the bones and teeth of sev- eral dwarf stegodons, an ancestor of the modern elephant. Other animal remains, including rats, bats, and fish, show signs that they were cooked around the time H. floresiensis inhabited the caves. Jaw-dropping Instead of following a simple evolu- tionary path culminating in modern hu- mans-j%wz<? sapiens-\\h& discovery of LB1 suggests early humans branched into many more forms than previously thought-some of which survived until very recently. The find also shows that small-brained humans could evolve without losing much of their intelligence. \"It is literally jaw-dropping,\" says Bernard Wood, an anthropologist at George Washington University in Wash- ington, DC. \"The implications for the evolution of the [human] brain are among the most interesting.\" \"It raises the whole issue of what it is to be human, or a member of the genus Homo? adds Chris Stringer at the Natu- 12 ral History Museum in London, \"and shows how little we really know about human evolution.\" Homo sapiens are thought to have colonised Flores island between 55,000 and 35,000 years ago, meaning they must have lived alongside H. floresiensis^ tens of thousands of years. Worn molars Indonesian archaeologists have dug at the Liang Bua cave site for the past 20 years, so at first the small skull misled the excavation team. \"We thought the skull and the man- dible was from a child,\" says excava- tion site director Thomas Sutikna of the Indonesian Centre for Archaeology, who was there when the discovery was made in September 2003. \"But after a week, we checked the teeth and saw that they were already worn, and that the molars had erupted, so she was more than 20 years old.\" The authenticity of the remains has been confirmed by three-dimensional X- ray images which revealed the internal structure of the skull of LB 1, something that would be virtually impossible to fake. Accelerator mass spectrometry dat- ing suggests that LBl's remains are 18,000 years old. But New Sc/entis/has learned that some bone fragments could be as young as 13,000 years old. The oldest remains from the site are 78,000 and 94,000 years old, respectively. This means H.floresiensis survived well beyond the last Neanderthals, which are thought to have disappeared from Europe and western Asian about 28,000 years ago. Splendid isolation \"The most remarkable thing is that there was a time, not so long ago, when two very different human species walked the planet,\" says Peter Brown of the University of New England, Australia, who led the team that made the discov- ery. H. floresiensis is thought to have descended from a population that be- came marooned on Flores during the last MUFON UFO Journal Ebu 's skull (left) is much smaller than that of a modern human (image: PeterBrown) few hundred thousand years. Its tiny size was probably an adapta- tion to isolated island conditions, where a low calorie diet and the lack of large predators made smaller physical char- acteristics advantageous. There is no evidence the Flores was ever linked by land to other parts of south-east Asia, so the ancestors of this species might have used boats or rafts to reach it. But the fact this population evidently became isolated suggests that they may have relied on temporary land links to first reach the island. Cause of demise unknown What caused the demise of H. floresiensis is unknown. It is possible that they were out-competed for food and other resources by H. sapiens or that they were wiped out by a volcanic eruption about 12,000 years ago.

Indiana Cave Road sighting BLOOMINGTON - On Oct. 14, 2004, the witness was driving west on Cave Road be- tween 10:15 and 10:30 PM, when he observed a cloud bank ahead of him \"light up.\" Immediately thereafter, an ob- ject with three brilliant spotlight- like white lights descended into view. The lights were shining down onto the ground, be- low and behind the object, at a 45-de- gree angle. The lights emanating from the craft illuminated its underside, revealing a rounded or disc-shaped structure. As the witness' vehicle made the turn onto Gifford Road, the object was continuing its descent, finally leveling out at tree line height. The object came to a full stop only twenty yards ahead of the witness' ve- hicle, with the three \"spot lights\" shining directly downward onto Gifford Road. The object remained stationary for a few seconds, then \"blinked off.\" No additional navigational lights, bea- con lights, or forward landing lights were observed on the large craft. When asked about the size of the object, the witness reported simply that it was \"big!\" From inside his vehicle, the witness could not hear any accompanying sounds from the object, nor did he experience or observe any associated physical dis- turbances. Monroe County Airport is only a couple of miles east of the sight- ing location, but is situated at a right angle to the object's south-to-northwest head- ing.

He called to his family, and they got out the binoculars and watched as one turned on to its side. This craft was a cross shape, and it started to rise slowly. The other one stayed upright, and it was a saucer shape with a quite high dome and what appeared to be legs. They continued to watch, and it moved to the side, rose up, and disap- peared, with the two objects moving to- gether and then apart. Thanks to Peter Davenport. California cylinder RIVERSIDE - A white object was seen flying north to south, reflecting sun- light on Nov. 1,2004, by a police officer who was going for his daily walk. He noticed a white object appear above the treeline in a blue and clear sky, with strong and gusty winds at 11:40 AM. At first, he thought it was a toy bal- loon, but it became apparent that the object was not being tossed about by the wind, but was proceeding from north to south, straight as an arrow and contrary to the wind direction. It passed almost directly overhead, he says, reflecting the sunlight as it passed. It appeared to be shiny, opaque white, not serf-luminous. There were no wings, fins, or other protrusions visible. The shape was a short tube with rounded ends, like a vitamin capsule or maybe an aircraft drop tank. He watched it until it disappeared in the dis- tance to the south. There were jetliners visible in the sky at the same time on approach to LAX and Ontario airport, and they appeared much higher than this object. He reports, \"The speed of the object reminded me of a military jet making a pass at an air show-fast but not super- sonic. There was no noticeable noise from the object, but there was a lot of background noise due to the wind in the trees. \"I am a law enforcement officer with 18 years experience, and have been an airplane buff since childhood.\" More Phoenix lights? 40 MILES S. OF PHOENIX - On Sept. 23,2004, at 9:30 PM six bright, golden lights similar to the \"Phoenix lights\" of 1997 danced across the desert sky, separate and perfectly angled from one another, according to the witness. 'Two of the lights were vertical to one another,\" said the witness, \"arid appeared to be separated by at least a thousand feet. The other four lights, if connected, would have made a perfect square. \"I could not tell the distance at all. It was a clear night over the desert. The lights could have been five miles away, or 30 miles. The lights then disappeared, sometimes two at a time, sometimes one. Then, they would immediately appear maybe a mile to the west of where they had just been seconds before-again per- fectly spaced from one another. \"At one point, one of the lights van- ished, and immediately like a strobe ef- fect they moved across the sky for maybe half a mile, then vanished. The lights would appear for about 5 seconds, then vanish for 10 minutes, then show again. I have been an airline pilot for over a decade and have never seen anything like this.

Illinois Halloween UFOs SOUTH CHICAGO SUBURBS - Three red lights were seen flying in a triangle formation, starting at 6:55 PM in the evening sky shortly after sunset on Oct. 31,2004. Hundreds reported seeing the strange red lights on the ground in the communi- ties of Tinley Park, Orland Park, Oak Forest, Frankfort, Manhattan, and Mokena that lasted to after 11 PM. The local police department was flooded with calls from citizens, curious to know the cause of the lights. Similar reports were given to the National Re- porting Center. The formation appears to be indistin- guishable from a formation of three red lights reported on Aug. 21,2004, in the same general area. Given that the lights reportedly were simultaneously visible over a broad area seems to suggest that the individual lights are fairly large, with high-power sources of illumination. Moreover, the lights were visible by observers from as far away as twelve miles, further underscoring our suspicion that the lights were not the product of some sort of hoax, despite their appear- ance on the night of Halloween. Field Investigators of the Illinois Chapter of the Mutual UFO Network (MUFON), supervised by State Direc- tor Dave Marler, are actively investigat- ing the two incidents. Thanks to Peter B.Davenport. Big saucer zooms in Texas RICHARDSON - The witness re- ports, \"My boyfriend and I were lying on a blanket stargazing in my backyard around 11:30 PM, on Oct. 29,2004, when we saw this saucer-shaped thing exactly like you see on TV fly over us. It was extremely big, bigger than my average size house. \"It was saucer-shaped with a little hump on top, only extremely big. I and my boyfriend just stared at it for a few seconds. It was really odd because it had no lights coming from it, yet we could still see it. \"It was like someone took a picture of it during the day and stuck it in a pic- ture of the night. It was dimmer than that, but clearly visible. It zoomed from side to side over and over, and then forward and back over and over like a pattern. \"Then it made a hideous sound, like a cricket chirp magnified by a million. I thought something exploded and that the entire city must have heard it. My Mom and dad heard it too, but didn't see any- thing. \"Then it zoomed over our heads and was gone. I figure it must have zoomed away, but one minute it was there, then the next it was gone. Like a blink. You blink, it's there.

On each tip of the triangle, there was a white light. There was no noise, it was silent. It appeared to be hovering or moving at a real slow pace. \"There were two airplanes flying around the craft, appearing to inspect the huge UFO. The planes looked like ants compared to the huge craft. As we drove along the highway, we lost sight of it near Dunlap Avenue. \"Traffic on the highway appeared to take notice, too, as we slowed down to 55 mph. A police car was next to us observing the UFO with us. We had our digital camera with us and were able to take photos and video of the UFO. \"Because it was night, the photos and video are blurry, but you can clearly make out the object's shape with the red lights hovering over Phoe- nix, AZ.

He stood up and looked out his window to get a closer look. All of a sudden, they came back. He reports, \"The lights were circling around on a saucer, and you could tell the object was disc-shaped. It was about the size of a full moon, and maybe 1-2 miles away. Then, the lights vanished. When the lights vanished, it seemed as though the object itself did too. \"Then five seconds later, they came back. The colors didn't change. The object was moving south for about three seconds when they finally vanished and never came back. There was no noise.\" Thanks to Peter Davenport. New York gray objects NEW YORK CITY - The witness reports, \"On Oct. 27,2004, at 10:15 PM, the night of the lunar eclipse, my 13-year- old son and I were observing the moon inside Central Park through binoculars. \"I was gazing up at the rest of the sky, marveling at the stars, which is a real pleasure when you live in the city.

South Carolina large triangle CHARLESTON Air Force Base - The witness was sitting outside on Oct. 20, 2004, at 8:20 PM when he noticed eight white lights blinking in the distance, and as they moved closer he saw they blinked in a huge triangle pattern. One light blinked at the top, and then three or four blinks down the sides si- multaneously. The craft was huge, and it flew towards the Air Force base. When it reached about the edge of the military property line it changed direc- tion and flew towards the flight line and center of the base. \"I was on a cell phone with a friend,\" says the witness, \"and she pulled up to see the top of the triangles blinking light before it disappeared behind a row of trees two streets away. \"It was high up enough that 1 could make out all the lights, even though it never got on top of us, but about the level planes fly when they are mid-level in the sky. \"The craft should have been low enough to be heard, but it was quiet. The lights moved across the sky together, never getting farther or closer apart. We stood staring into the sky, and two min- utes after it disappeared, a solid red cir- cular light came from almost exactly where we had seen the triangle last, and it was flying swiftly in our direction. \"I am at the far end of the base, and I only hear jets take off. When the red circle was overhead of us, we heard a jet take off-the roar is loud and unmis- takable. Suddenly the red light just blinked out. \"The triangle of lights was huge, maybe a half mile across, and the red circle was about the size of an airplane.\" Thanks to Peter Davenport. UFOs over Himalayas TARAI REGION, INDIA - \"Moun- tain villagers in the Tarai region of India's Himachal Pradesh state claim that UFOs have been seen by day and by night near the high-altitude glaciers of the Himalayas, and that aliens are building a very large underground base up there. \"Since Sunday, Oct. 10,2004, UFOs ranging in size from very large cylindri- cal objects of a dull silver color to small speedy discs have been seen over the glaciers north of Chini, about 25 miles from India's border with China. \"Indian military personnel are report- ing many exceedingly abnormal activi- ties and UFO sightings all around the clock. Some Indian helicopter pilots are complaining about sophisticated jam- ming. Some of the Indian Air Force pi- lots are continually reporting seeing strange flying objects in the Himalayas near the Chinese border. \"There are many indications that a large underground base is now being built within the hard andesite (bedrock) of the high Himalayas.

Friedman More on the impossible After lectures and on radio shows, I am sometimes asked what I am work- ing on now. My response is usually that there are two books I would like to write and for which I am gathering data. One is Flying Saucers and Science. This would include updates on many of the MUFON Symposium papers I have presented, and cover areas that few oth- ers seem to deal with about the Cosmic Watergate, technology and saucers, SETI vs. ufology, etc. The other will be a book, It's Impos- sible, Isn 't It?. History is loaded with examples where progress in many dif- ferent areas has been significantly de- layed by the obstacles raised by well educated noisy negativists, ancient aca- demics, and fossilized physicists. They want to protect us from the new \"foolish\" concepts, technology, and mind expanding views. I dealt in a general way with the false assumptions that underlie these attacks in a Journal column in September, 2003. Here I will deal with several more sharply drawn examples. My purpose is to get people to think about areas in today's world where similar bias, igno- rance, and arrogance are standing in the way of their looking at the evidence re- lated to flying saucer visitations. Moon exploration impossible? A past target for my scorn has been Dr. Lee Deforest (1873-1961) because of his off-the-wall comments about space travel. He was quoted by the St. Louis Post Dispatch (February 25, 1957) as say- ing, \"To place a man in a multi-stage rocket and project him into the control- ling gravitational field of the Moon where the passengers can make scientific ob- servations, perhaps land alive, and then return to earth; all that constitutes a wild dream worthy of Jules Veme. I am bold enough to say that such a man-made moon voyage will never occur regard- 16 less of future scientific advances.\" It took all of 12 years to accomplish this \"wild\" science fiction dream. Now Dr. Deforest, PhD from Yale in physics in 1899, was himself a very innovative and interesting individual. He obtained more than 300 patents. Many peop- le, especially himself, consid- ered him the father of mod- ern radio as the inventor of the Audion tube which made radio and tele- vision possible. He actually Stan Friedman broadcast Enrico Caruso from the Metropolitan Opera House in New York City in 1910. He was also a pioneer in making talk- ing motion pictures possible, and spent the last 30 years of his life in Hollywood. Clearly, rocketry and aeronautics were not his areas of expertise. Did he really not recognize his ignorance in these areas when he made his com- ments? I hadn't appreciated the fact that he himself in some ways was a victim, much earlier, of the same closed minded atti- tudes by \"experts.\" I do think it is hilari- ous that one of the first books about him, published in 1930, was entitled Con- queror of Space ...radio waves, not rockets. In one of his many dealings with ap- parently unscrupulous characters, he was part of a company that sold stock to ob- tain funding for the development of ra- dio in the early 1900's. A court action was brought for fraud. The district attorney noted in the court proceedings that \"Deforest has said in many newspapers and over his signa- ture that it would be possible to transmit the human voice across the Atlantic be- fore many years. Based on these absurd MUFON UFO Journal and deliberately misleading statements, the misguided public... has been per- suaded to purchase stock in his com- pany.\" Deforest was acquitted, but the judge advised him \"to get a common variety of job and stick to it.\" Deforest had hoped to win a Nobel Prize in physics, but had many enemies (he was married four times and was in- volved in many lawsuits), and did not. Guglielmo Marconi was also a pioneer in the development of long distance ra- dio communication (really wireless te- legraphy at the beginning) around the turn of the 20 th century. However, he did win the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1907. During a recent trip to Newfoundland, my wife and I visited the facility at Sig- nal Hill in St. Johns, Newfoundland, in which he received the first transatlantic radio signal. The signal, basically Morse code, had been sent, without wires, from Cornwall in England. Impossible across the ocean? The kicker here was that a number of physicists had said it would be impos- sible to send a radio signal (wireless te- legraphy) across the ocean because ev- erybody knows that radio waves travel in straight lines, and the curvature of the earth would make it impossible to cross the ocean with radio signals. Sounds reasonable at first blush, even though earlier tests had been conducted over shorter distances that still should have been blocked because of the earth's curvature, but were not. It wasn't until 23 years later that the electrically conducting and radio wave reflecting Ionosphere was discovered. But as we know from so many ex- amples in ufology, \"Absence of evidence does not mean evidence of absence.\" Even after the receipt of that first sig- nal on Dec. 12,1901, there were those in Newfoundland who didn't want Marconi to set up business there. There were strong commercial inter- ests who didn't want wireless transmis- DECEMBER 2004"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"sion to be pursued, because it would hurt the business of those with telegraph lines, never mind the many seagoing vessels that later received assistance when un- expected events occurred because they were able to send distress signals with the new wireless devices. Underwater cables had been laid at great expense to take signals across the ocean. I suspect there is a parallel here with the SETI Specialists who want des- perately to listen for electromagnetic sig- nals from space to discover extraterres- trial civilizations. They are totally unwilling to pay at- tention to the enormous amount of evi- dence indicating that aliens are visiting \"in person.\" If aliens are visiting, who needs SETI? Another victim not so lucky Marconi won his battles, but another innovator who had the courage to pur- sue his findings, Ignatz Semmelweiss (1818-1865), did not win. As a young doctor in Budapest, Hun- gary, he had noticed that the infant mor- tality in the baby delivery wards seemed much higher (10% in those cases where young residents rushed from doing dis- sections to the-delivery rooms) than in the wards served by midwives (3%). He noticed that the residents wiped their hands on their aprons. He checked statistics over a period of time, compar- ing the deliveries done in certain rows of the room with those in others. He found a surprisingly great difference. He reasoned that it was something on the hands of the rushing doctors, so he set up the practice of washing hands with a strong soap solution, and found a no- ticeable drop in infection and death rates. However, he had strong enemies who thought his ideas were absurd, and who put tremendous pressure on the hospital to push him out of the system despite the facts. Obviously they \"knew\" there was no way anything (visible) could be transmit- ted from the corpses to the delivery room. He actually wound up in an in- sane asylum. He died there of an infec- tion in an open wound that had been ex- posed to the same ; biological agents (Streptococcus pyogenes) that had caused the fatal infections (puerperal fever) in the delivery room. DECEMBER 2004 His practices had saved many lives, but that wasn't good enough for his jeal- ous colleagues. Flying is impossible? Back to flight again, I am reminded of the immortal words of one of the greatest American astronomers in the 19 th Century, Dr. Simon Newcomb. In October, 1903, he made this pro- found comment: \"The demonstration that no possible combination of known sub- stances, known forces of machinery, and known forms of force can be united in a practical machine by which man shall fly long distances through the air seems to this writer as complete as it is possible for the demonstration of any physical fact to be.\" Of course there was nothing in his training and experience which would in- dicate that he knew anything at all about flight. The Wright Brothers demon- strated with their first flight in Decem- ber, 1903, after many hundreds of wind tunnel and other tests, that flight was in- deed possible. Charles Lindbergh, who certainly had been an aviation pioneer himself, told Harry Gugenheim (of the Gugenheim Foundation which had supported re- search by rocket pioneer Robert Goddard) in May, 1936, \"I would much prefer to have Goddard interested in real scientific development than to have him primarily interested in more speculative achievements which are of less real value.\"  . Another real expert who stuck his foot in his mouth, according to President Harry Truman in his 1955 memoirs, was Admiral William Leahy, who, speaking of the atomic Bomb development project in 1945, said, \"That is the biggest fool thing we have ever done... the bomb will never go off, and I speak as an expert in explosives.\" . Obviously, his nuclear knowledge would have been almost nonexistent. Errors by governments A number of governments have made serious errors with regards to the devel- opment of techniques-and these errors changed the course of history during major wars; One of many such false conclusions was reached by the Germans during MUFON UFO JOURNAL World War n, who thought the idea that anyone would spend five million dollars to break their enigma (code) machine was inconceivable-too radical. They refused to accept the reality of the compromise of enigma even when they were presented with solid evidence to the contrary. There are many other examples of resistance to the new, the different. We should be learning from the past to avoid making similar mistakes in the future. A good source of fascinating examples of the will not to believe, no matter the facts, is the Library of Congress Legis- lative Reference Service 48-page book- let, \"Erroneous Predictions and Nega- tive Comments Concerning Exploration, Territorial Expansion, Scientific and Technological Developments,\" CB 150, by Nancy T.

This author of Communion and other books reminds us of the importance of our closest relationships. Perhaps this is especially appropriate during the holiday season when we tend to place too much emphasis on material things. The unexpected Saturday, Oct. 18, was the most ter- rible day my wife and I have ever known. It started out as a lovely and very nor- mal day. We went to a movie, then watched a baseball game with our son. At about nine, we went home. On the way, Anne suddenly said, \"I have so many wonderful memories of my marriage.\" I was rather surprised-not that she had good memories of what has been a wonderful marriage for both of us, but because she said it. She's a here and now person, not given to retrospection. I said that I was so glad to hear it, and I felt just the same. We arrived home, and she went into the bathroom. As I was entering the house, I heard her say, \"Whitley, I need your help.\" Her tone sounded as if she wanted me to lift something or perhaps reach something for her on a shelf. But then I saw that she was buckling at the knees, and in an instant, thirty-five years of pure bliss turned into a night of absolute terror and suffering for both of us. It is now three weeks since that night, and we are still in the dark of the woods, still wondering if the shadows are going to catch us. As I write this, Anne is suffering from pneumonia and is in and out of conscious- ness. There is so much that I don't know about what will come next. Even the doctors cannot tell me what to expect. But when my girl is awake, she's re- ally awake, and that bright soul is danc- ing so easily in her pain and the terror of 18 her situation that my heart is humbled to see it. She cannot speak because of all the tubes, but today when I walked into the ICU, she flashed me the A-Ok sign. When I bent down to her, she raised her hand and gen- tly stroked my head, smiling as best she could from behind her mouthful of breathing ma- chinery. We had gotten to the time in our Whitley Strie her marriage when just being together is a quiet de- light. As you get older, every moment begins to seem precious. It's why you see old couples who are deeply in love being so tender to each other. We know that part of the vow, \"till death do us part,\" has a most precious resonance, that has to do with the eter- nity of love and the sacredness of life's journey. I know that Annie has found peace in herself. I can see it in the beauty of her smile, feel it when her hand squeezes mine, see it in the many ways she ex- presses her sense of humor. We are both facing an unknown that we desperately want to come into focus: what will hap- pen to her; what will become of our life together? But those questions cannot be an- swered now, not by the doctors or by anybody. They must remain unfocused, as Annie's body either regains its health or does not, and she either comes back fully or in some other state, or it turns out that this is when she travels on. For a long time, I have felt the most acute agony in the face of these torment- ing but unanswerable questions. I don't mind if I am to be caregi ver for my wife. To me, that would be a gift from God, a MUFON UFO Journal privilege that would bring a whole new kind of joy to my marriage. But what will Annie have to go through if she comes out of this diminished, and is conscious of it? How will she bear that suffering? More than anything, I do not want this person who has been the object of my devotion for so long to experience a single moment of suffering, let alone a lifetime of it. But it may happen that way. It's not the most likely outcome, and neither is dying, but both are possible and there is absolutely no way to tell what is to come. Of course, that's always true in life, but at a time like this, our normal state of unknowing becomes a truly ferocious torture. One comes to a question: what do I have to fall back on? What strength have I to bring to this? How can I help my wife? What now does it mean \"to love, honor and cherish?\" At a time of extraordinary suffering and fear like this, when she needs any- thing she can get, what I want to give is everything I have to give. And yet, it's not going to be enough. Nothing I can do can make her well. I can cast a little water on a raging fire, but I cannot put it out. I sing to her a little song that we used to sing, hand in hand, walking together through the streets of New York, when we were young: \"The river is wide, I can't cross over, nor have I the wings to fly; build me a boat that will carry two, and both shall go, my love and I.\" The river did not really seem so wide, then, not like it does now, a great dark- ness flowing, the stringent torrent of time and chance, its far shore glimmering with things unknown. I have, from deep childhood, two words I learned at my mother's knee: trust grace. \"Whitley,\" I hear her say- ing, \"trust grace.\" Not trust grace to make my wife whole again, or trust grace to give us a miracle, or trust grace for any hoped-for outcome. Simply trust grace. DECEMBER 2004"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"And that is, I am finding, enough. We are here in this world to experience time and chance. It's not up to God to make our lives turn out one way or another. When bad things happen, it's not God's fault. It's not anybody's fault, in fact. Surprise is essential to the perfection of souls. Without it, we cannot be free enough to choose between sin and sanc- tity. It's the price we pay to be here, and I find that I'm glad for it. I do trust grace. I am surrendered to what may come. And so is my beloved. I can see it in the radiance of the smile that comes from behind the tubes. She knows what has happened to her. She knows her situation and the unsureness of her future. And her re- sponse is that smile, and I know why: somebody did build us a boat, and she's in it. Come what may, she has grace. I have joined her, finally, after these weeks of deepest anguish. Wherever our boat takes us is where we go. If we must part, then I will carry within me the joy of our marriage, and she will carry it to God. If she stays, then it will be, yet again, a new marriage, made of days so pre- cious that I can barely imagine what they will be like. How will it be to embrace her, whole again, after this? To walk again in the evening, quietly discussing our day, then . to share our bed in the breezy night, to awaken again beside her, and see in her eyes the sparkle of life? I can only say this, that great suffer- ing is an alchemy, and the secret of the philosopher's stone is that love is gold. Our whole Me together is, at this mo- ment, compressed within me into a single, shining moment. I recall as if it was just a moment ago, our first meeting. We were both entirely alone in New York, and had filled out the forms of a computer dating service. . A primitive one, to be sure. I was a young advertising executive. We got each other's names on a list. I phoned one or two of them, but had no luck. I was pretty low on the totem pole when it came to prospects-not a pilot, a doctor, a lawyer, just a kid crunching numbers in a windowless office and liv- ing in a run down apartment on the dreary end of a dreary street. She was a receptionist. I recall, as I walked into the office where she worked, I saw this extraordinary woman sitting there. She had huge, glorious eyes. She was stunning to me. And I thought, \"hell, why can't that be her?\" I said to her, \"I'd like to see Miss Mattocks, please.\" She smiled and said, \"I'm Anne.\" The most amazing sensation went through my body, a shock as if of some wonderful electricity and I thought, \"oh please like me.\" Until October 18, we had not been more than two weeks apart, and only once for that long, not in thirty-five years. Of course our marriage has had its ups and downs. We've fought, but fights are part of good marriages. A marriage is a struggle, basically, to learn to really trust another person even though that person is flawed. The only way you can do it is to give all that you have and not keep score. That is Annie's way, and mine, too. She gives all she has to this marriage. I do the same. And now what we have is this great struggle. When she smiles up from her bed at me, I remember my mother's words: trust grace. Don't keep score, that's not man's place. Just trust grace and, whether things are good are bad in your eyes, you will belong to God's goodness. When I was five, mother began read- ing the Bible to us. Not a person to do things by halves, she read every word of it from Genesis to Revelation, for half an hour a night every night until just be- fore my eighth birthday, when she read, \"even so, comes Lord Jesus,\" the last words of Revelation. Then she closed the book and an- nounced, \"and that is the word of God.\" That word has been inside me ever since, as if it is somehow engraved upon my soul, and at such a time as this, I am so grateful for those Bible nights. Like my mother, my wife takes a great interest in the Bible. She has her own ideas about everything, but she trusts it deeply, and knows it well, and when it comes time, at the end of another hospi- tal day, for our family to pray together, her smile returns as I lay one hand on her forehead and hold my son's hand with the other, and ask God to receive our suffering. And then, in the late night. I awaken, the shadows all around me, and think on this life, how each generation passes into memory, as we must, and Annie and I must, and I sense the presence of the kingdom, and am drawn closer to it as if on a great, sighing wave of surrender. Then I sleep again, and perhaps drift along the paths of the night to where my beloved lies in her hurting sleep, and kiss her with the secret kiss that souls share naked in the night. And so it goes, two lovers in our little boat, sailing the storm, our song barely there but there, an echo in the wind. I've Got My Girl Back! Saturday Nov. 13,2004 Yesterday, Anne woke up. I mean this in a profound way, new for me, that is unlike anything I have ever seen be- fore. Well, not quite: I remember a few years ago when my sister woke up like this. One moment, the eyes are there, but they are just eyes. The next, something glistens from within, and you see it: the soul has returned to the surface of life, called back from where it stood, waiting for the body to either embrace it again or let it go. Anne's body has embraced her soul again, and I, also, have been included in that embrace. I was the shadowy form who was always there, singing my song of hope and longing: I love you, you're my precious, come back to me. And so she did, travelling along the strange byways of illness and the edge of death-I see her moving lightly, touched by the wonder before her, and yet unable-quite-to ignore that voice from the past, calling and calling from the world of the living and the heart of a very deep love affair. So she came back. Yesterday, she was confused, sometimes quiet, some- times talking too much. But, by the end of the day, I could see her soul again, looking out at me with the perfect truth that this ordeal has taught me resides in DECEMBER 2004 MUFON UFO JOURNAL 19"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"every living eye. When she fell down, the first thing I noticed was that a kind of absence came into her eyes. I thought it was death, it looked so cold, so empty. But there it was, in eyes so dear to me that they matter more than my own eyes, the blank abyss. Then, just five days later, all seemed well. She was awake, with no signs of fever or sickness or the horrific side ef- fect of brain bleeds, vasospasm, that constricting of blood vessels that re- moves all trace of consciousness, leav- ing the victim in a coma-like thrall that, to the lover at the bedside, seems wo- ven of hell's own eternities. She sank away then, before my eyes, the abyss coming again while my heart broke and broke. But even at the worst moments, she still had two things: her smile and the grip of her hand. When I told her how much I loved her, how dear she was to me, that smile would rise up out of the darkness and shine forth, soft sometimes, but always there. And her hand would tighten in mine, and my prayers would sing on, wind in the wires of death. So it went, long days and longer nights, as we skated along the farthest edges, me and my stricken dreamer. But then, on Wednesday, things changed, and this time in a fundamental way. The doc- tors figured out the puzzle of her fever and broke it with a smart new antibiotic. And my girl came back. She turned around in the tide that was carrying her into memory and began to swim, and then she came up through the froth and onto the beach, where she is now, still weighted from her ordeal in the sucking ocean, but most definitely back. You do not walk away from a catas- trophe like this, any more than you walk away from being shot through the head. No, you struggle back by inches, through the confusion of your shattered mind, back to the surface of the world. Anne is doing that now, talking and talking, exploring herself and her past and all the hidden meanings, the things dropped in the crannies of her mind, the bits of debris that make up a person's reality. This has its funny side. For example, her nurse said to me, \"Earlier your wife was, uh, talking about-ah-UFOs and aliens and we're-well-a little concerned. She said she was, well, an expert...\" I said, \"She actually IS an expert on that subject. In fact, she's one of the leading experts in the world.\" He looked at me. \"Oh,\" he said, \"that, ah, that ex- plains it.\" Then he added, \"She says she talks about them on some sort of...web radio.\" So I said, \"She does. She has an internet radio program and she does talk about UFOs and aliens on it. Quite a lot, actually.\" \"Oh,\" he said, \"oh, good. Ah, this one does have us concerned. She said that George Washington stayed at your house.\" From the bed came her voice, still hoarse from her intubation: \"Robert E. Lee.\" The nurse nodded solemnly. \"Robert E. Lee,\" he said. I said, \"Actually, Robert E. Lee did stay at my great grandmother's house. Before the Civil War.\" He looked over at Anne. She smiled. Quiet triumph. I could see it in her eyes: see, I only SEEM confused. But that isn' t entirely true, for she does have a level of confusion. It's less every day, though, and it is awesome to see her ranging around through her memo- ries, her thoughts, her ideas, reweaving the fractured universe of her inner self. She talks and talks and talks, and I listen to the flood of memories, of ideas, to the great themes of freedom and cul- tural richness and the value of women that keep recurring, that are connected with Anne's very essence, and the abid- ing compassion that drives it all, revealed plain by the intensity of her struggle. Lying there, helpless, her mind swim- ming in a suddenly murky sea, my wife's essence is proclaiming itself, telling it- self: remember who you are. I said to her something that I said to my sister, that was deeply healing then and will be deeply healing now. My sister had no insurance, with the result that we were not able to afford lavish rehabilitation. So I gave her re- hab, the same way I am giving it to my wife. Although, because we are insured, she will also have more of the profes- sional kind. I theorized that a big part of the struggle after a stroke involves fear-fear that something has gone terribly wrong, that perhaps it will not come right, that one's very essence has been thrown into free fall. So I said this, \"Your mind was like a pond that you used to swim in, a little fish who knew every nook and cranny of that pond, where everything was hid- den and where all the secrets were kept. \"Suddenly, somebody threw a rock into the pond. And the water got clouded with silt, and you ended up swimming blind. \"But it won't stay like this. The silt will settle back to the bottom of the pond. And things will come clear again.\" At that moment, my sister fell asleep and slept for 24 hours, and then began to reconstruct herself. My wife listened, then looked at me for a long time. She said, \"That's exactly the metaphor I was reaching for and couldn't find.\" And she grew quiet, calmly reflective for the first time since she'd awakened. She's stopped running from the fear that her mind has been ruined. Now she's ready for the next step, putting the pieces of the golden puzzle of self back together again. And there's this guy beside her, re- joicing now that all the medical effort and all the prayers and all the healings have gotten us to this place: the place where only the highest tide of the ocean of oblivion can reach. Here we stand, as always, hand in hand, in the privacy and universality of our suffering, praying that the danger is truly passed, and that tomorrow will be better than today. I know that it will. I can feel it in her grip on my hand, can hear it in her voice, see it in those limitless eyes: I' ve got my girl back. Amen! Case reports Investigators.

Michigan man a go-between? Michigan MUFON's chief investiga- tor, Dan Wright, recently presented an account of a 1967 UFO encounter that occurred in Albion, MI. Although the case was not brought to Wright's attention until May of 1982, the details surrounding the event appeared to be indelibly etched in the minds of the witnesses involved. Although details of the case are far too involved to relate in this article, a brief overview is in order. (Dan plans to write a book on the case.) In late August of 1967 an Albion butcher, Charles William \"Bill\" Smith, age 35 at the time, was driving his pickup down a deserted road near his home when the engine suddenly stalled. He looked up through the top of the windshield to see a large domed saucer hovering over the vehicle. Telepathically, Smith is told to contact his priest, Father Gerald Boyer, and con- vey the message of their presence. The ship then departed and Bill continued home. Only minutes after this incident, from their front yard. Bill and his wife, Marge, observed a pair of 15-foot red-orange balls of fire over a barn 250 feet away. The fireballs approached the Smith home and moved slowly and silently over the roof, then continued to a point above a swampy woods 300 yards away. They then descended and simply \"winked out.\" On Nov. 24,1967, Smith and his wife watched the sky as a one-foot red-orange fireball hovered over the roof of their home. Momentarily, it moved away laterally and accelerated out of sight. Smith finally broke down and told his priest about the sightings and telepathic communication that he was instructed to convey. Father Boyer not only believed him, but claimed to be one of the extraterres- trials incarnate in human form! Father Boyer was more than happy to accom- pany Smith to his home to watch for a return visit. They were not disappointed. On March 14,1968, Smith, his-wife, Father Boyer, and eight other witnesses (four of whom were nuns) watched in amazement as three fireballs approached them. The four nuns fled the scene in terror. On May 7,1968, Smith, Father Boyer, and a third witness observed a very large bulbous cyUnder in the sky, glowing am- ber and ejecting numerous auto-sized discs that were also glowing amber. That same evening, Smith witnessed the landing of one of the ejected discs. Several 4 1/2-foot beings, clad in silver suits, descended a ramp and once again telepathically communicated with him. They attempted to convince him to \"go for a ride.\" Smith was apprehensive, to say the least, and refused to go with them. They obviously respected his de- cision, but told him that he will receive subsequent messages that he is to pass along to Father Boyer. Smith also claimed that a helicopter crew landed in his field around that time. When he went out to ask them what they were doing, he was told to \"get out.\" Shortly thereafter, a plain-clothed gentleman who identified himself as \"Maj. Holmes\" came to his door asking questions about the encounters. After the helicopter incident, Smith was unwilling to talk to or trust anyone connected with the government. Maj. Holmes' inquiry was rebuffed. During an 18-month period in 1967/ 1968, dozens of neighbors, friends, rela- tives, and other visitors observed regu- lar intrusions of glowing spheres over the Smith property. Mrs. Smith s daily diary offers com- pelling testimony to further support the family's account. Wright says this is his best-ever \"cold case\" and that it is still open and ongo- ing. -Thanks to MiMUFON. Mars Reconnaisance Orbiter to send back more detailed photos As Earth pulls away from Mars af- ter the close approach in August, NASA is developing a spacecraft that will take advantage of the next close encounter in 2005. That spacecraft, Mars Reconnais- sance Orbiter, will make a more com- prehensive inspection of our planetary neighbor than any previous mission. For starters, it will examine landscape details as small as a coffee table with the most powerful telescopic camera ever sent to orbit a foreign planet. Some of its other tools will scan un- derground layers for water and ice, iden- tify small patches of surface minerals to determine their composition and origins, track changes in atmospheric water and dust, and check global weather every day. \"We're reaching an important stage in developing the spacecraft,\" said James Graf, project manager for Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif. \"The primary structure has been com- pleted.\" The structure weighs 220 kilograms (484 pounds) and stands 3 meters (about 10 feet) tall. At launch, after gear and fuel are added, it will support over two tons. Also, the mission's avionics test bed has been assembled for the first time and put to use for testing of flight software. Workers at Lockheed Martin Space Systems, Denver, will later add instru- ments being built for it at the University of Arizona; at Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory; at the Ital- ian Space Agency; at Malin Space Sci- ence Systems; and at JPL. \"In several ways, Mars Reconnais- sance Orbiter will advance NASA's fol- low-the-water strategy for Mars explo- ration,\" said Dr. Richard Zurek, project scientist for the mission. Probing below Mars' surface with penetrating radar, Reconnaissance Or- biter will check the depth of the frozen water previously detected.

Ozark UFO Symposium to celebrate 17th year Lou Parish's popular Ozark UFO Symposium in the resort city of Eureka Springs, AR, will mark its 17th year this coming April 8-10. This conference is somewhat unique in featuring many of the same speakers each year, including Wendelle Stevens, Grant Cameron, Linda Moulton Howe, and Timothy Good. Nancy Talbott, who is becoming one of the \"regulars,\" is not yet confirmed for 2005. On the \"new\" list is David Marler, MUFON State Director for Illinois, and possibly Scott Ramsey, who has re- searched the Aztec crash site. Other speakers will be announced later. Parish says he is considering eliminat- ing the speakers' panel so that he can include one more speaker. He also notes that he will have to in- crease the cost a bit this year to $45 advance, and $50.at the door. Accommodations and meals are avail- able at moderate prices at the popular Inn of the Ozarks, where the symposium is held, as well as at numerous other nearby motels and eating places (the tourist season has not yet begun in April, but the weather is great).

However, none of these projects can be accomplished without significant funding. Since MUFON is a non-profit corpo- ration, we are seeking tax-deductible donations earmarked at completing these projects as early as possible. Past UFO organizations collected file cabinets full of UFO reports that were accessible to only a few people, and when the organizations were shut down the files were dispersed, and many of them lost to the public. The MUFON Business Board wants to prevent this from happening to the MUFON files by making them available in electronic form. Dubbed The Pandora Project, the goal is to scan all of the UFO reports going back to 1969 when MUFON was formed and produce CD-ROMs that are keyword searchable. Professional scan- ning company bids are all in the $35,000 range for this project. In addition to UFO reports, the MUFON files contain hundreds of re- ports of Bigfoot, crop circles, anomalies, special reports, studies, and news clip- pings. The second phase of The Pandora Project is to scan all of these files and make them available on CD-ROMs. The estimated cost for this phase is $25,000. MUFON has been providing a monthly magazine since the organization began. Called Sky look & first, and then The MUFON UFO Journal, the maga- zine back copies exist only in a paper format. The goal is to convert the past issues to electronic format and make them available on CD-ROM. The fourth scanning project involves scanning all of the 35 years of the an- nual MUFON Symposium Proceed- ings, and making them available on CD- ROM. MUFON has a history covering nearly every facet of the UFO mystery. It is our intent to make this available to all seekers, regardless of their affiliation. MUFON members are urged to seek out special donors capable of making these projects a reality as soon as possible. Position Announcements Ike Bishop has stepped down as State Director for Idaho.
