SIGNALS FROM OUTER SPACE The press--American and foreign--kas I been giving considerable space since the first of the year to wh6t may be signals from intelligent beings f?mm outer space. Professor Sir Martin Ryle, head. of Cam- bridge University's Redlo Astronomy Dept. (Ehgland), sums up the reaction of many of his colleagues when he declared, \"This is probably the most exciting astronomical discoveq of all time.\" The signals--0ccuring at re@& in- te-mals (contrary to the irregular radio slgnals from the stars)--were fi'rst dis- covered by the new, large radio telescope at Cambridge University, Aug. 6th of last year, but no public announcement was made until February of this year when the technical data was given in a Bjritlsh scientific journal. About the same hgland was recei.c;ing the signals, they were also being recorded at the world's larg'est radio-radar tele- scope at the Arecibo Ionospheric Observ- atory, Arebebo, Puerto Mco, where the dish-shaped antenna reflector is 1,000 feet in diameter and the high frequency antenna is 96 feet long, suspended 435 feet above the reflector.

SCHROTH COMPARES UFO3 S The November issue of SKYLOOK carried a brief story of a large unidentified object seen from differerent areas in Greene County, 3ct. lkth, and reported by the Springfield press. To recap, five sheriff's deputies spotted the UFO from various parts of the county between 6 and 6:15 am. Inmon, Kordalis and Deckard were on Highww M near South Cam- pell whem they saw the object, which Inmon described as giving the impression of being suite large. He said it appeared to have two nblong-shaped windows with a white glow com- ing from the interior and a long red flame coming out of the rear. Kordalis said the ~b$Xt appeared to be traveldng west at a rate 3f speed, then turned south and disappeared. He estimated the object to be about the size 3f a four-engine plane, without the wings or tail, and that it had two ms of lights which looked like lighted windows. The lights were not bunking and appeared white or bluish white. Young and Osuchowski said they saw a 50 foot streak of red-orange light. They estimat- ed its altitude at 1000 to 1500 feet from their position at the public school at %is D'Qc. (continued on page three) 1897 UFO's IN MO.-ILL.

With the aitor We recommend that those of you who have not already done so read \"Flying Saucer Fiasco,\" John G. Fuller's report in the issue of LOOK. We had been given some reason to believe the forthcoming Condon Report on unidentified flying obdects wodd be a f4r and objective consensus of a year and a haif of scientific invehtigation ''with no strings attached.\" Our recent reprint of Herbert Shuldirier's \"Can We Trust the upcoming' Conaon Report?\" supported the implied promise that govemenh policy (believed by many to be as \"scientific\" 86 the ostrich's purported motive in sticking itr bead in the sand) would bave no part in guid. ing the Condon group's study and report to thc public. At .long last Science would triwqb over Policy and spades would be called spades Never again would a veil of swamp gas be drawn across a clear report; never again woulc a star visible on one side of the earth be \"moved\" to the opposite side to explain a strange object in the sky; and never again would \"plasma\" be the magic word to cover argr. thirig that \"swamp gas\" and st-, would not. There have been hints recently that the same old wool is going to be pulled over our eyee. Both NICAP and APRO have voiced strong doubts and the former has fully endorsed hrller'e apticle. Othem have questioned there being any real change in the modus operandi. Some of Condon's staff has re- signed and sane have been fired because of their voiced dissatisfaction with the pro- jects operstiom. Fuller calls it \"a half-mlUion dollar trick\" to mike ue believe an objective in- vestigation has been under way. If he is correct in his blunt statement and he seems to have the evldence to back it--then we're being set up for another bedtime story cal- culated to put ue to sleep and end our an- noying llttle questions. Like the ostrich, we'll have our eyes and ears fill of \"sand\" and t&en we won't see or hear a thing. Are you ready to accept your non-think sedative? Mre Bad news ie the announcement Dr. Rmmk E. Stranges will host a new TV series on UFO's being planned for this fall by NBC. This combined with word we have received that the Carroll Watts alledged saucer ride is to be the subject of one half-hour show seems to indicate this is going to be a series calculated to heap so much ridicule on the subject of UFO's that any mention of one will elicit a beUy laugh. %ranges, ae you know, has authored a book, which he c- is me, about a citi- zen of Venus who has been employed at the Pentagon since 1959. A series baeed on what has REALLY been observed by responsible citizens would be far mre interesting than contactee yarns of saucer rides and conversations with little green men. WHAT WAS IT? O.A. Hughes, .of Pulaski County, Ark., wae sitting in his boat on Lake Winona when he heard a funny noise which at first sounded like a blue-winged teal taking off, then suddenly burst into explosive sound. Mr. Hughes said he instinctively ducked and when he jerked his head around there was a huge splash in the lake about 200 yards l'mm him and geyser of water shot up into the air. He said the sound was like that of a 105 howitzler, but he has no idea of what caused it. He called the Air Force Rue to see if it could have come f'mm an aircraft of some Idnd, but they said it could not. It remains a stery.

He and mix others of his group were about 40 miles northeast of Seoul and he waa cleaning a machine gun when he glanc- ed up to notice a bright object in the sky. At flrat he thought it might be a piece of paper blowing in the wind; but' as it came closer at tremendous speed out of t,he north- west the men could see it was a cone-shaped object reflecting the bright surilight. The wind was f'rom the eouth, \"bout 25 miles per hour. The object moved due west and was in eight about Go mlnubm. UFO's OR MBIElRS? Two interesting reports appear in the Sssue of SKY AND TEXE3COPE.

H:T. Howard, senior research engineer at the Stanford Center for Radar htmnomy, re- p~&~ they have received the signals several times during the early morning hours fm 3 to 6 am on a frequency of 112.8 megacycles in the aircraft navigation band. They come in short pulses, exactly 1.337 seconds apart and Last .1 of a second. The signals are so weak by the time they reach Standpord, near the San Francisco airport, they cannot be actually heard by human em but are recorded visually on tape. Their source is belleverd to be betwee the stars Vega and Altair and about 180 light years away. The nearest stars Fe some three light years away. The National. Radio Observatory in West Vir gika also has reported picking up the signsls since Standford's success. It is reported the British have discovered four pulsars in various parts of the sky, and these are do being studied by the Arecebo Observatory. Dr. Frank D. Drake, who heads corn ell!^ Puerto Rican observatory, reports that three of the pulsars generate pulses of almost identical length. They range from 38 to 40 thousandths of a second. The intervals between the pulses we fiwn one to one and a third seconds, each pulsar having its characteristic rate. The fourth one differs in varLous ways. Its pulse rate is only a quarter of a second. Its pulses consist of a single, very sharp signal and is estimated to be three tines closer to the earth' than the others which are believed to be within the Milky ww, our 'own gal-. Drake calculates the most distant pulsam me 'some 300 Ught yeam way, whereas the nearest is about 100 Ught years distant. Cambridge scientists, as well as some ~thers, admit the psiiblility of sidnals ~eing be& to us from intelligent beings Ln outer space. One Cambridge scientist said, \"We have noticed that occasionally the strength of the signal is a little weaker nnd this produces a sllghtly different tone. Ws variation could be some kind of code Sir Bernard Lovell, British astronomer, says, sed sdds, \"There ia certainly the possibil- Ity of the signala coming from an intelli- 3ent life source.\" American scientists have also expressed simiLar beliefs and Al Bialek, formerly Kith the government Space Technology Labor- my in Los Angeles, says even if the sLg- nals are not aimed directly at us, they may be produced by an intelligent civilization as \"directional beams or light houses for a space navigation system, similar to our uwn eystema for air and sea mvigation.

TULSA GROUP HEARS WA'ITS TAPE The Oklahoma State Chapter of APRO met at the public library in Tuba, April 11, with 50 or more people present and we have a re- port from one who was there. All listened for an hour and a half to a tape recording of Carroll Wayne Watts, 29 year old Texas fanner, who has been in the news since he first told, and then denied, a storj of encounters with space people and rides in a space ship in which he was given a physical examination by a machine which \"hugged\" him. Watts broke down after a lie detector test on Feb. 25, according to the Amarillo press, and said his story of seeing a gray cylindrical spacecraft and gray squatty Martians was scripted by a Panhandle artist and memorized in fouk sessions of hypnosis. The photographs which were also furnished by the artist, were claimed by Watts to be pictures of the UFO. Back to the tape--Watts said on his ww from bco to Amarillo, he was beaten up by two men and threatened after wwch he de- clared his story was a hoax. That night L his house was shot at by speeding motmists. Now, apparently over his fright, Watts insists on the tape he did talk to space men and rode in their ship. Our informant doesn't buy any part of - this remarkable tale and-thinks, as does your editor, the inxitation to tell his story on - a TV series slated for this fa1 (see . editorial) accounts for'his about face. Bill Courter, heading the meeting, also @petard to put little stock in the story, but plannd to accompany Watts to Chicago for the TV interview.
