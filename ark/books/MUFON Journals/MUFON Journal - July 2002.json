Why? Given the broad number of samples allegedly featuring alien languages, either in spoken or written form, and other attempts at communication evi- dent in the case files and literature, this is surprising. In fact, most of the references for scrutinizing sug- gested alien languages comprise either small snippets re- lating to unsubstantiated official documents which herald the study of hieroglyphic or Sanskrit-like writings associ- ated with crashed LTFOs, 2 or the work of enthusiastic ama- teurs probing into the abduction phenomenon, whose ex- pertise is often in other subjects. While the latter are sometimes well intended, they are not extensive or conclusive enough to determine the sta- tus quo or suggest further specific examinations. Actual expert opinions in respect to alien semiotics are very thin on the ground. Hence the reason and aims at the core of the Alien Semiotics Project underway since 1999, an en- deavor to question and cooperate with abductees, wit- nesses, and researchers to explore the UFO abduction narratives and literature, and to involve unbiased quali- fied experts in the aforementioned (and other) fields to give alien languages(?) and symbols a fair appraisal, us- ing \"scientific methodology,\" and see what can be learned about this specific focus on the topic. This article forms the basis of some of the questions the project addresses. How do aliens speak to us? The bulk of communication reported as done by aliens (or whatever or whoever claimed to be responsible for the phenomenon) is by telepathy or utilizing some form of technology of mind transference; certainly Eddie Bullard 3 and a few other equally meticulous examiners make rel- evant note of this predominant feature of the alien con- tact experience. 4 However, an inspection of the available case files sug- gests that telepathy does not always apply to the commu- nication reportedly overheard between aliens themselves. 5 There is a plethora of totally telepathic, a sizeable portion of part-telepathic, and a proportionally varied 6 mixture of verbal and other types of alien communication involving sound and light. 7 Linguistic experts and critics find telepathy a \"conve- nient\" attribute of the abduction scenario because it ne- gates the necessity of inventing and inserting a language within the narrative, and thus seems to favor less exotic and more mundane origins for the phenomenon-which is a valid point. However, unless alleged alien semiotics are studied properly, no one will know either way. If it is true that aliens are communicating with us by The Rosetta Stone telepathy, either directly from mind to mind or via some technology enabling alien to human mind communication, this ultimately could open up completely new vistas and a revolution in the future of epistemics. •• Learning to understand the structure of any alien lan- guage, even if we do not possess the equivalent of an alien Rosetta Stone to decipher it, could be equally inter- esting and challenging. The aforementioned could ex- plain some of the popularity of psi topics like remote view- ing and channelling rapidly becoming part of a New Age world movement that is more readily connected to the UFO and abduction phenomenon. But how real are these concepts? Are there any bona fide alien languages in abductee reports, and if so how many? What can we learn about these languages? Are there any hoaxed or invented alien languages? What are the structures and features of all these languages? How do they compare with each other and with recognized terrestrial languages and symbolisms? Do any fully coherent alien languages, in either pho- netic or written/symbolic format, exist in the data arising out of the abduction or contact phenomenon? Do some of the witnesses know them? What are the features of these languages? Why have these languages been report- edly taught to specific abductees? These are just a few of the general questions the project covers. We do not intend a cursory study or witch-hunt, but a determined effort to try and recognize and under- stand alleged alien languages using any available data or information. In a significant portion of cases dating from the hu- manoid and contact era right up to the present date, where July 2002 MUFON UFO Journal"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"aliens use verbal communication, the reported beings some- times appear more than adequately adept in the language of the witness. How and why is this so, given that such reports pertain to a considerable global sampling (of vari- ous languages) used by abductees and experiencers? There are of course many examples where the aliens' speech or sound communication has been unintelligible or difficult to describe and imitate. 8 Strange verbal and other mutterings include a wide range of pitch (or tone), barks, 9 grunts, whistles and melodic as well as other unknown speech or sounds. Few such examples are said to be understood properly in any way, either by the abductee/experiencer or by anyone else. What can lin- guists, phoneticians, cryptanalysts, psycholinguistics and other experts bring to such a topic in cooperation with witnesses? Other posibilities A number of other diverse meth- ods of alien communication have also been suggested, including channelling and mediumship, flashes of light, and recognizable or confusing gestures and barely ex- plicable forms of symbolic commu- nication occurring at a cellular, spiri- tual or indeterminate psychological level. 10 Richard Hall suggests that the medium itself could be the com- munication, where UFO waves could represent a sophisticated un- derstanding of human psychology in capturing our attention.'' Indeed the possibilities for com- munication could be vast or mini- mal depending upon circumstance Symbols on Roswell debris as drawn by Jesse Marcel, Sr. in 1981 at the urg- ing of Dr. Linda Corley. CETI has focused on many of these problems and arrived at some fairly logical conclusions which could be helpful in the business of alien communication, but per- haps these have not yet incorporated the entire benefit of linguistic input and might not be applicable to an alien mind. In this context, it should be noted at the outset that the amount of variety even among human languages sur- prises some people. There are in fact more than 6,000 human languages, which can be grouped into about 200 families; each of these families is not known to be re- lated to any other. On the sur- face at least, this huge collection of languages varies a great deal; some of them are very different indeed from languages like En- glish (notably in respect of gram- mar). It can be argued that these differences relate to major dif- ferences of mind-set/world view. But the scale of this variety would presumably be vastly greater where alien languages were concerned. We should ex- pect to find utterly unfamiliar structures and types of usage (as well as unfamiliar sounds). In any examples where the alien mind or perceptions were apparently so different from ours as to render communication dif- ficult at best, perhaps only very basic exchanges might be pos- sible, along mathematical and similar lines. 13 By not adequately anticipat- ing possible scientific interest in and perceptions-both ours and those of the aliens. In cases where particularly strange high-pitched sound or where seemingly no communication or exchange was noticeable, or where the aliens decided to leave after short duration or interaction with humans, it is possible that there may have been something occurring beyond human compre- hension or perception. Maybe aliens have unsuccessfully attempted commu- nication with us at a number of different levels and loca- tions and by different methods in the past. 12 Successful communication has also been postulated, in spite of the assertion that logic may suggest that ET Intelligence (ETI) might first try to understand us and our methods of com- munication and language before attempting exchange. The pitfalls and requirements Paradoxically, in understanding an alien language, we may first be required to learn as much as possible about the alien mind, physiology, and perceptions, and of how these may differ from ours, especially in respect of meth- ods of communication, so that any message we may con- vey will have a chance of being properly understood. this area, phonetics reported in some cases are not de- scribed or documented accurately or properly. E.g., was the utterance really 'Dbano da skigyay o dbano' or 'Deebahoh day skigyay oh deebanoh' or 'Dabanno da skigyay ho dabanno' etc. 14 Of course, even if they did anticipate this, few people actually have phonetic train- ing (which would enable them to hear unfamiliar sounds accurately) or the ability to use the standard phonetic script with which all linguists represent all known speech sounds. Unknown sounds? Indeed, as we said earlier, it is quite possible that alien languages would involve sounds which are not used in any human language or are even impossible for humans to pronounce. Naturally there are no existing symbols for such sounds. 15 We are asking only that people who have reported such events do the best they can. There is also the potential for extreme difficulties if one is attempting to reply to an alien welcome with a misconstrued greeting which could be an insult, derived from erroneously interpreted data.

Ori the scale of one species trying to talk to another, matters could be entirely different, and there may not always be a ready compromise; communication might have to be either on bur terms or on theirs. Academic commentators like Thomas Gold, Dr Albert Hibbs, and Carl Sagan long agopbinted out other possible dangers of initiating communications with ET, e.g., we might be setting ourselves up for catastro- phe. 16 But here we are assuming that we do wish to at least understand ET. The message and narrative of the aliens in UFOlogical literature contain many diversities, absurdities or contra- dictions, especially when subjected to in-depth singular scrutiny or overall comparisons. It can be difficult to see what may or may not be relevant with regards to semiotics. In the absence of the aliens them- selves to clarify such matters, the best clues may originate with the abductees and experiencers, who often express frustration in not being able to interpret or understand such elements present in their own experiences (for many rea- sons). If would be an ideal situation for an abductee to take a cassette recorder on their abductions with them, but this seems non-viable given the nature of the phenom- enon. 17    , For this project we need samples which are as long as possible. Frequently, samples of alien speech or writing are not long enough to make substantial linguistic or other analyses. Shorter samples are useful only if translations- preferably \"literal\" ones-are available, and of course even longer ones are more useful with translations than with- out. . . We realize that many, people who say that they can understand such material report that this understanding is \"holistic\"; they understand whole messages rather than individual words or phrases. This makes the linguists' task more difficult, but if they can work with the people who report the usage they may still be able to analyse the lan- guage systems involved. If you know an alien language-written, spoken or oth- erwise-we would like to hear from you, with as much information as you can provide. The things we are par- ticularly interested jn are: 1. Alien scripts, and texts written in these scripts, with a description of how they are written i.e. left to right or right to left, top to bottom or bottom to top, starting where on the page. We also need to know if each symbol repre- sents something like a whole word (like in Chinese), or a sound (like in our alphabet), or whatever. If words are generally made up of two or more symbols (as in an al- phabet), it would help to know where the various words in each text begin and end. Ti maUfgsafV-'* »X • 2. Translations into English (or other terrestrial lan- guages) of texts written in such scripts (very welcome indeed wherever possible). 3. Spoken alien language, ideally recorded on tape, but if this is not possible, in the form of transcriptions either into \"imitated spelling\" (where you represent the sounds as best you can using the spelling of English or of your own strongest language; it would help here if we knew which language you are thinking of and/or which • English or other accent you have) or (better) into standard phonetic script, if you know it. 4. Translations into English (or other terrestrial languages) of spoken material (again very welcome indeed wherever possible). 5.Alien insignia from uniforms, craft or elsewhere, or any symbols or motifs seen in an alien environ- ment, including star maps or symbols on instrumentation. 6. Body marks made by aliens that suggest symbolic or other geometri- cal patterns. These are all important to the vari- ous analyses underway. Samples of sketches or drawings, photocopies, or scanned images may all be sent to the project, with brief accompanying background details about the experience and as many details about the communication aspects and the alien physiology as possible. Detail concerning whether hypnotic regression was used to recover memo- ries is also useful. Submissions are courteously dealt with in all cases, either in confidence or openly as the contributor stipu- lates or desires. We ask permission to accurately repro- duce the samples into data sets for analysis purposes and for possible academic or other publication at a later date; and, where possible, we encourage continuing com- munication or correspondence to ask necessary ques- tions and to update contributors regarding the project. Experiencers; researchers, and spectators alike com- ment that there may be a deceitful element of the phe- nomenon of alien communication on the part of the aliens, and it is further suggested this may be part of some co- vert agenda or that aliens may communicate by code or somewhat secretly. 18 This is one of the reasons why cryptanalysis must be a crucial element in such a study. While cryptography may be a possibility, it is also likely there could be hith- erto misunderstood features of alien mind or language, which would appear like code to us, analogous to for- eigners misconstruing certain features of indigenous cul- tures and languages and also to Chinese Whispers 19 in- volving an unclear initial message where the latter be- comes so distorted or diluted as to be completely unrecognisable and interpreted only within the frame- work of the end-hearer-albeit perhaps inaccurately.

The cell phone rang and a female apologized for a wrong number. Dr. Pugh thought this unusual as it had never happened before. Shortly thereafter, she noticed some specific J lights low'above the trees off to the left. The sky was overcast, but the glow of the city lights from Tifton lit up this section of cloud cover. The Pughs considered these particular lights to be unusual because they were so low. Proceeding on, they approached closer, and she observed an aircraft shaped like an elongated triangle. She further noted there was a white light at each cor- ner and a red light in the bottom center. She was close enough that she could clearly see the dark triangle shape against the glow of the overcast. Traffic and road condi- tions prevented her from pulling over at that point, so she drove on a short distahqe and turned into a water tower area. Quickly looking back, she saw the .lights slowly move across the road. She turned around and drove back to get a closer look, but could not locate the lights and triangle again. She drove back toward Tifton and turned off onto another road in her search, then encountered two addi- tional but indistinct craft or objects with lights'to her front. She tried to make out their shape, but'they were oppo- site the glowing overcast and against a black sky. The Pughs rolled the car windows down and could hear.the sound of roaring jet engines apparently corning from the lights/craft, as they seemed to fly along very slowly. These lights went back to the area where first observed, and as Dr. Pugh negotiated traffic and got turned around to re- sume her search, she returned to the area of the water tower. Once again she observed the lights, hovering over a nearby house. Headlights from passing traffic blinded her momentarily, preventing her from further seeing any shape. The lights then.crossed the road again and disap- peared as she continued to negotiate traffic and turns in order to get closer still. This, in my opinion, is a classic triangle encounter made even more unusual by what Dr. Pugh described as sec- ondary indistinct slow moving craft (\"things\") with lights, accompanied by a sound like roaring jet engines. Past MUFON, MUFONGA, and ISUR triangle investigations have involved jets, helicopters and other aircraft in the vicinity of these triangle Craft either before, during, or afterwards. One very disturbing case comes immediately to mind-John Schuessler's investigation of the Cash- Landrum UFO Incident of 29 Dec 80. This case, which is described in John's book, involves helicopters, an extreme roaring sound, as well as loud whooshing and shrill beeping sounds loud enough to hurt the ear. While no flames were mentioned in the Pugh case, she seems certain about the roaring jet-like engine sounds. The locality of this Tifton event was not in a major urban area where car horns, trains, emergency sirens and common urban background noise might easily drown out other specific sounds. Dr. Pugh made a valiant effort to close with these unknown craft, and I can attest to the darkness and difficulty of these south Georgia routes at night. The personal account was forwarded to John Bodin Sr., MUFONGA's Deputy Director for south Georgia, who lives in nearby Wray. Bodin and Dr. Pugh can further coordinate this investigation. The National UFO Report- ing' Center (NUFORC) has no real recent triangle re- ports listed for Georgia. However, Florida is listed for two triangle reports in May and one for SC in February. Stone map in China may point to ancient advanced civilization Cosmiverse, Pravda and Outside Asylum have run a series of articles about stone maps that have been found in China that may date to some 120 million years ago. The map appears to be a topographical relief on a scale 1 : 1.1 Kilometers. The map indicates the use of civil engi- neering to create a system of channels about 12,000 km in length and 500 meters wide, and 12 dams that are 300 to 500 meters wide. Their work is being peer reviewed in the scientific community, so there is some hope and rea- sonable possibility that this is not a hoax. The map was found by scientists who were working on researching possible Chinese immigration to Ural and Siberia. When this was originally found, it was thought that it had been carved by hand and to be some 3000 years old. Upon examination, it became obvious that this was machine made. It was also discovered upon x-ray examination that the map is made up of three layers, including a layer of a type of ceramic that has never been used in China. Even the technology available today for information needed for such a map is reportedly only in the develop- ment stage by the US and is not expected to be finished until the year 2010. While examining the stone, two shells were found on its surface. The age of one of them is about 500 million years, while of the second one is about 120 million years. If the dating is correct, and it is not a hoax, then it means the map was made by either an advanced civiliza- tion whose remains have just been found, or by interstel- lar travelers.

Just as the Indians were preparing for an attack on the Spaniards, a comet fell among them, on Saturday at midday, and which was seen by many Christians at our fort as it travelled with greater brightness than other comets, and from which, once fallen, a beautiful woman came out, also dressed in white, who told them: \"I served the Christians, don't go against them because they are very brave and will kill you all.\" The Indians did not follow her advice and continued with their plan, only to face defeat at the hands of the conquistadors shortly afterwards, just as it had been fore- told. As far as I am aware, this was the earliest written account of a living creature emerging from a comet. The belief that a comet could serve as a vehicle for a living being may be older-especially if we consider times when meteoric phenomena were thought to be angels or de- mons in flight-but Valdivia's account of a humanoid en- tity emerging from a fallen capsule was probably the first story of this kind included in an official report. One could be forgiven for asking the fairly obvious question, How could any animal, plant, or person live in- side a rock without air, food, or water? Yet the simple fact is that it was taken for granted by many that such things could occur in nature. Take, for example, the many cases of amphibians and snakes said to have been found alive inside stones dug out of the ground by workmen in quarries. In his introduc- tion to Holinshed's Chronicles, William Harrison (1535- 1593) notes several instances of \"lively creatures shut up in the hard stones and living there without respiration or breathing, as frogs, toads, etc...\" In his time, he writes, a snake was found \"in a coffin of stone at Avignon, wherein a man had been buried, which so filled the room and lay so close from air that all men wondered how it was pos- sible for the same to live and continue so long time there.\" British historian William of Newburgh (c.l 136-1198), German philosopher Albert the Great (c. 1206-1280), the German scientist Georg Agricola (1495-1555), the French naturalist Pierre Belon (c.l517-1564), and the Flemish antiquary Jean Becan (1518-1572), among others, men- tioned similar incidents in their writings. If you think that by the late nineteenth century people would know better, think again. Over the next four hundred and fifty years numerous writers would come to the conclusion that extraterrestrial life, if it existed; could flourish in or on the comets that orbited our planet. Some even thought that life on Earth may have resulted from the chance impact of a rock con- taining primitive organisms. However, it was not until the nineteenth century that newspapers began to publish sen- sational stories about people who actually broke open comets to find aliens entombed inside. To my knowledge, the first purportedly factual story involving a \"creature from a comet\" was published in the French newspaper Le Pays on June 17, 1864. The ar- ticle, \"Un Habitant de la Planete Mars,\" reported that a large rock had been discovered on James Peak, a moun- tain in the Arapaho Forest, Colorado, and a strange \"mummy\" covered with calcium carbonate had been found in its interior. Alongside these remains there was also a silver lamina decorated with drawings of planets and animals, indicat- ing that the artefact had come from another world. The names of those who found the object were noted as be- ing Paxton and Davis (we will encounter these two again). It goes without saying that none of these finds were ever put on display or presented to the scientific world. However, this is hardly surprising, as the story, though sold as fact, was a piece of science fiction written by French author Frangois-Henri Peudefer de Parville. The following year, de Parville published a version of the tale again in a book with the same title, Un Habitant de la Planete Mars. This time the story of the comet that fell in America with the calcified remains of a Martian inside served to develop an idea that had already been in vogue for a long time: the possibility that the universe was teeming with life and inhabitable planets! As it turns out, de Parville's book was not particularly memorable in itself, but the leg- end of the \"extraterrestrial in a comet\" that probably origi- nated with him was destined to become a model for many hoax reports in the world's press over the following forty years. Now we must turn our attention towards South America, or Argentina to be precise. Where de Parville's tale was for over ten years I don't know, but it emerged again in two articles published in La Capital, a newspaper based in Rosario, Argentina, on Oct. 13 and 14, 1877. In the first of these, \"Eureka! Eureka!,\" a French chemist named A. Sevarg tells that while he was walking by the river in Carcarana, Argentina, he came across \"a large black oval- shaped rock.\" Sure that it was a comet or something similar, he decided to examine it with the help of his friends Charles Davis and John Paxton, two geologists. Sevarg explains, \"We employed an Argentine laborer, Jesus Villegas, to analyse the different materials. The cracks and roughness of these are immediately notice- Page 8 MUFON UFO Journal July 2002"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"able, and fairly large pieces must have broken off them; the whole mass is covered with a certain black enamel, from three to nine and a half inches thick.\" After six days' work on the hard rock they came upon an inner chamber that measured two cubic varas. There they were surprised to find \"a white metal amphora\" made of silver and zinc, \"riddled with holes and bearing strange drawings.\" Suddenly they realized that they were stand- ing on a square metal sheet that seemed to cover another cavity. •  . On lifting this they discovered a second chamber, con- taining \"a rectangular gallery, bored into the granite and full of stalagmites.\" There was a body in it, alongside a drawing of the solar system and a silver plate. The body had some very unusual features: it had a bald head and old wrinkled skin like leather, a tube in its forehead in- stead of a nose, a tiny.mouth containing only fourteen teeth, long arms and five fingers on each hand (the fourth of which was shorter than the others). The brief article published on the 14 lh of the month announced that the objects would soon go on show in.two hotels. The same story was reproduced in El Defensor de la Constitution, published in Zacatacas, Mexico, on July 20,1878, and a similar story, again published as a factual report, found its way into the Peruvian newspaper South Pacific Times in 1878. Months later, on January 16-1879, the Argentine newspaper El Constitucional printed a version of all these stories, but this time set in Central America. : A survey of the literature available during the period in which the crash stories were published helps us under- stand the context in which such claims were being made. Works advocating the theory that comets could harbor some form of extraterrestrial life were widespread and accepted.   . . In 1834 a Swedish chemist named Jons Jakob Berzelius examined a meteorite that had fallen near Alais, in south- ern France, on March 15-1806, and made the unexpected discovery that it contained humic acid, an organic com- pound. Of course, Berzelius did not go down in history as the man who found proof of extraterrestrial life, since a short time before, his student, Friedrich Wohler, had shown that inorganic chemical reactions could produce the kind of organic compounds he found in the rock. And yet their pessimistic findings, published in Annalen der physikalisches Chemie 33:113, set;a precedent that would be followed by innumerable claims made by zeal- ous alien hunters over the next 160 years: For example, in 1859 two scientists, M.F. Wohler and M. Homes, announced they had found carbon compounds of a decidedly biological origin in a meteorite that had fallen in Hungary. Five years later, another researcher, S. Cloe'z, claimed he had found a material similar to peat and lignite in a separate meteoric fall. When Camille Flammarion (1842-1925) published his optimistic opinions on the subject in a revised second edition of La Pluralite des Mondes Habites in 1864 the theory entered the col- lective consciousness of the world forever. In 1871, W. Thomson, otherwise known as Lord Kelvin, went as far as to suggest before the British Association for the Advancement of Science that life had probably been seeded on Earth by \"moss-grown fragments from the ruins of another world,\" thus popularizing for the first time what came to be known as the theory ofpansper- mia. , Evidently, speculation on the existence of life inside comets and meteorites was popular among scientists, and practically anyone with a little scientific knowledge would have been aware of the hypothesis. Today the battle rages on. UFO Crashes in Montana The following article was published in several North American newspapers in the autumn of 1865: An Extraordinary Story A Meteoric Shower Crockery Falling from the Sky Mr. James Lumley, an old Rocky Mountain trap- per, who has been stopping at the Everett House for several days, makes a most remarkable statement to us, and one which, if authenticated, will produce the greatest excitement in the scientific world. Mr. Lumley states that about the middle of last September, he was engaged in trapping in the moun- tains about seventy-five or one hundred miles from the Great Falls of the Upper Missouri, and in the neighborhood of what is known as Cadotte Pass. After sunset one evening, he beheld a bright lumi- nous body in the heavens, which moved with great rapidity in an easterly direction. Visible for at least five seconds, it suddenly sepa- rated into particles, resembling, as Mr. Lumley de- scribes it, \"the bursting of a sky-rocket in the air.\" A few minutes later, he heard a heavy explosion, which jarred the earth perceptibly, and this was shortly fol- lowed by a rushing sound, like a tornado sweeping through a forest. A strong wind sprang up about the same time, but suddenly subsided. The air was also filled with peculiar odors of a sulphurous nature. These incidents would make a slight impression on the mind of Mr. Lumley, but for the fact that on the ensuing day he discovered, at the distance of about two miles from his camping place, he could see in either direction a wide path had been cut through the forest. Giant trees uprooted and broke off near the ground. The tops of hills shaved off and the earth plowed up in many places. Great and widespread havoc was everywhere vis- ible. Following up this track of desolation, he soon ascertained the cause of it in the shape of an im- mense stone driven into the side of a mountain. The most remarkable part of the story is an examination of this stone and how it had been divided into com- partments. In several places it was carved with hieroglyph- ics. Mr. Lumley also discovered fragments of a sub- stance resembling glass, and here and there dark stains, as though caused by a liquid. He is confident that the hieroglyphics are the work of human hands, July 2002 MUFON UFO Journal Page 9"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"and the stone itself, [as] a fragment of an immense body, must have been used for some purpose by animated beings. • Strange as this story appears, Mr. Lumley re- lates it with so much sincerity that we are forced to accept it as true. It is evident that the stone which he discovered is a fragment of the meteor which was visible in this section last September. The stone will be remembered in Leaveriworth, Galena, and in this city by Col. Bonneville. At Leavenworth the stone separated into particles and exploded. Astronomers have long held that it is probable that the heavenly bodies are inhabited-even the com- ets-and it may be that the meteors are also. Mete- ors could be used as a conveyance by the inhabit- ants of other planets in exploring space, and it may be that hereafter some future Columbus, from Mer- cury or Uranus, may land on this planet by means of a meteoric conveyance, and take possession thereof-as did-the Spanish navigators of the New World in 1492-and eventually drive what is known as the \"human race\" into a condition of the most abject servitude. There must be a race superior to us, and this may at some future time be demon- strated in the manner we have indicated. The above article was first published in the St. Louis Democrat on Oct. 19, 1865, and was reproduced in The Cincinnati Commercial on Oct. 30, and in the British Daily Whig in Ontario on Nov. 15. This would not be the last nineteenth-century report of a mysterious object crashing or exploding in North America, but it is one of the most convincing. It goes without saying that there are clear parallels with the South American stories of crashed spaceships (the date of the report, the \"compartments\" within, and the hieroglyphics). The very fact that the craft resembled a rock should make us wary. Twenty years later, in 1884, a ranch in Nebraska was allegedly the scene of a UFO crash involving a cylindrical object which exploded in the sky. Cowboys watched in amazement as bits of machinery rained down close to where they stood. One man received burns to the skin when he approached too close to the main crash site while another \"fell senseless.\" The debris purportedly 'dissolved' after a few days. Are there any grounds to believe this story, which on the face of it does not seem to resemble its predeces- sors? This is a relatively unknown case, so it would seem appropriate to reproduce the original article in full here before we look into that question. We will draw the fol- lowing reports from the Nebraska State Journal, though in fact it was first published in the Nebraska Nugget. A CELESTIAL VISITOR A Startling and Curious Story from the Ranges of Dundy County. It is Evidently a Machine of Human Manufac- ture. All Particulars that are Yet Learned. Special to The State Journal. BENKELMAN, June 7. A most remarkable phenomenon occurred about 1 o'clock yesterday afternoon at a point thirty-five miles northwest of this place. John W. Ellis, a well known ranchman, was going out to his herd in com- pany with three of his herders and several other cowboys engaged in the annual roundup. While riding along a draw they heard a terrific rushing, roaring sound overhead, and looking up, saw what appeared to be a blazing meteor of immense size falling at an angle to the earth. A moment later it struck the ground out of sight over the bank. Scrambling up the steep hill they saw the object bounding along half a mile away and disappear in another draw. Galloping towards it with all their speed, they were astounded to see several fragments of cog-wheels and other pieces of machinery lying on the ground, scattered in the path made by the aerial visitor, glowing with heat so intense as to scorch the grass for a long distance around each fragment and make it impossible for one to approach it. Coming to the edge of the deep ravine into which the strange object had fallen, they undertook to see what it was. But the heat was so great that the air about it was fairly ablaze and it emitted a light so dazzling that the eye could not rest on it for more than a moment. An idea of the heat may be gained from the fact that one of the party, a cowboy named Alf Williamson, stood with his head incautiously exposed over the bank, and in less than half a minute he fell senseless. His face was desperately blistered and his hair singed to a crisp. His condition is said to be dangerous. The distance to the aerolite, or what- ever it is, was nearly 200 feet. The burned man was taken to Mr. Ellis' house, cared for as well as cir- cumstances would allow and a doctor sent for. His brother, who lives in Denver, has just been telegraphed for. Finding it impossible to approach the mysterious visitor, the party turned back on its trail. Where it first touched the earth the ground was sandy and bare of grass. The sand was fused to an unknown depth over a space about twenty feet wide by eighty feet long, and the melted stuff was still bubbling and hissing. Between this and the final rest- ing place there were several like spots where it had come in contact with the ground, but none so well marked. Finding it impossible to do any investigat- ing, Mr. Ellis returned to his house and sent out mes- sengers to neighboring ranches. When night came, the light from the wonderful object beamed almost like the sun, and the visitors who went out to see it were entirely powerless to bear the glow. This morning another visit was made to the spot. In the party was E. W. Rawlins, brand inspector for this district, who came into Benkleman tonight, and from whom a full verification of par- ticulars is obtained. The smaller portions of the scattered machinery had cooled so that they could be approached, but not handled. One piece that looked like the blade of Page 10 MUFON UFO Journal July 2002"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"a propeller screw of a metal of an appearance like brass, about sixteen inches wide, three inches thick and three and a half feet long, was picked up by a spade. It would not weigh more than five pounds, but appeared as strong and compact as any known metal. A fragment of a wheel with a milled rim, appar- ently having had a diameter of seven or eight feet, was also picked up. It seemed to be of the same material and had the same remarkable lightness. The aerolite, or whatever it is, seems to be about fifty or sixty feet long, cylindrical, and about ten or twelve feet in diameter. Great excitement exists in the vi- cinity and the round-up is suspended while the cow- boys wait for the wonderful find to cool off so they can examine it. Mr. Ellis is here and will take the first train to the land office with the intention of securing the land on which the strange thing lies, so that his claim to it cannot be disputed. A party left here for the scene an hour ago and will travel all night. The country in the vicinity is rather wild and rough, and the roads hardly more than trails. Will telegraph all particulars as fast as obtained. The writer of the above piece tries to keep the reader intrigued by the mysterious nature of the meteorite-like object, but gives the game away by so many references to \"machinery\" and \"cogwheels.\" Of course, the \"aero- lite, or whatever it is\" is a vehicle for traveling in the sky, its unusual properties and advanced technology indicating an extraterrestrial origin. With so many names and de- tails, who could doubt the writer's word? In this case, however, the farce was short-lived, and two days later, in the June 10 edition of the Nebraska State Journal, a second report dispels with the whole matter, magically dissolving the evidence and any expec- tation of further developments along with it. You can al- most see the journalist grinning at his desk as he delivers the punchline to a joke that had gone on for two days and may even have managed to boost sales figures overnight. Not surprisingly, researchers in Nebraska have found no written report apart from these newspaper articles, and folklorists have found that oral tradition is also silent on the matter. Needless to say, if the event had really occurred we would naturally expect at least one other independent source for the story. Ufologist Jerome Clark investigated the case person- ally. After speaking to Dundy County (Nebraska) histo- rian Ida Toler and prominent University of Nebraska folk- lorist Roger Welsch, both of whom had conducted their own enquires some years earlier, it became clear that nobody in the region had ever heard of the incident. The ranch where the object was allegedly found had actually existed but none of the events described seem to have happened at all. Furthermore, Clark points out that the follow-up despatch that spoke of the object dissolving \"like a spoonful of salt\" may have been a tongue-in-cheek way of advising readers to take the whole thing \"with a pinch of salt.\" The crash that wasn't In an article entitled \"Storie di 'crashes' nel XIX secolo,\" Giuseppe Stilo adds one more link to the \"crea- ture in a comet\" chain. The rumor that an extraterrestrial spacecraft crash-landed in the Italian town of Bergamo, near Sorisole, in 1884 has circulated for several years, often appearing as one more incident in a growing list of supposed \"crash retrieval\" stories. During his investigation of pre-1947 cases in Italy, Stilo was able to track down the original reports and uncover the truth. In its November 13-14, 1884, issue, L'Eco di Bergamo reported that a loud explosion had been heard in the sky over Bergamo just after 11 AM on Oct. 24. When a group of peasants said that they had observed a red fireball on the same day, both this and the explosion were immediately assumed to have been caused by the same meteoric phenomenon. The newspaper article, entitled \"Lo scoppio di un bolide,\" was written by a naturalist called Ferruccio Biazzi. In the report Biazzi expressed his opinion that \"aerolites bring with them traces of primitive flora and fauna similar to those of earth.\" No doubt this gave people reason to ex- pect that the discovery of the object or objects was going to be a dramatic affair, especially as \"the meteorites are said to have (and are certain to have) fallen in the Bazerem : Valley, or adjacent to it, after the explosion, and they have yet to be recovered.\" In the Dec. 9-10 edition of the same paper, another brief news item was published concerning the bolides. It reported that a shapeless black mass some 2.74 metres in diameter had been found by a group of scientists and stu- dents. The object was apparently a mere fragment of a larger spherical shape. \"The finding has already been com- municated to various [scientific] organizations because it is wished that it should be studied.. .It seems to be a highly important specimen because it also contains some curi- ous fossils.\" The item ended by saying that Mr. Biazzi would doubt- lessly like to know more and inform the readers of the latest developments as soon as possible. The news sounded very exciting; many believed it could lead to a scientific breakthrough. It is unfortunate, there- fore, that two days later, in its issue dated Dec. 11-12, L 'Eco di Bergamo was forced to admit that it had been the victim of a hoax. Biazzi had written to them to set the matter straight: there had been no group of scientists, no find and certainly no extraterrestrial fossils. Another news- paper, La Gazetta di Bergamo, published the same hoax report oh Dec. 11, printing Ferruccio Biazzi's rebuttal the following day. Of the many UFO crashes that made the headlines in the nineteenth century, that of Sorisole was the least spec- tacular and the most believable. There were no mummi- fied aliens in this account, no mechanical parts, only an undetermined number of fossils that many readers ex- pected the meteorite to contain anyway.

The Santral district inhabitants claimed that they witnessed a UFO landing in the backyard of the Fatma Pyrylty Primary School and saw an alien being getting out of the unusual craft. Eleven-year-old, Murat Esici, one of the witnesses who had a very close observation, said the entity was emitting red rays from his eyes, \"and his hands and feet were iron. He had a very big head and he was 1.80 meters long.\" Students Zeynep Cypynar and Nalan Donmez also claimed they saw an unusual craft and an alien beside it. \"His eyes and hands were red, and a red light was coming from his eyes.\" Turkey International UFO Mu- seum and SIRIUS president Haktan Akdogan is flying to investigate the sighting.

While filming lightning scenes with his amateur cam- era in Anadolu Hisari, Istanbul, Saffet Sap, a 42-year-old electrical engineer, and his sister, Serpil Sap, videotaped an unusual shaped UFO at 6:30 PM on May 26, 2002. He said, \"I was looking north when I saw a strange motionless object that started to ascend. There were green, yellow, and red lights flashing on top of the object, and it had 7 or 8 legs. The object moved overhead and followed a very linear path towards the north.\" After hovering for awhile, it departed slowly behind a hill, leaving a greenish trail behind it. The witnesses vid- eotaped for 3.5 minutes. The Sirius UFO Space Sci- ences Research Center analyzed the film, and chairman Haktan Akdogan presented the video to the media at a large press conference. The images were broadcast on Page 12 national TV and printed in newspapers. The images were said to have amazed the media because they were espe- cially clear and close up. Analysis indicated the object was hovering at 1500 to 2000 meters and had ten unlit round portals around the outer edge. The object was scattering lights in yellow, red, and purple. Closeup views indicate the object ro- tated periodically around its own axis.

Two officers on a routine patrol through Apex Park were stunned to see a silver shape hovering above the river at 5 AM this morning. \"Mildura divisional van crew members Kate and Greg were patrolling Apex Park when their jaws dropped at the sight of a very bright lit up UFO hovering over the river,\" the paper reported. A police spokesperson said. \"It appeared the UFO spotted them at the same time, as it shot off in the direction of Gol Gol. They attempted to give chase, but it had gone in the blink of an eye.

The UFO was there and static. It appeared to be made of a material similar to \"stain- less steel,\" but with a very strange shape, she explained. \"It was, rounded, but had a tail on one of its sides, which appeared to be part of the UFO itself; in other words, a single piece. The tail was surrounded by small white lights all around. The UFO was some 4 blocks away and at a height of 16 stories, giving the appearance of a large car. \"The tail was half as large as the UFO itself, giving it the apparent size of a large car. After two minutes, the UFO suddenly took off in a perpendicular direction at high speed.\" Ana said she felt excitement and joy during the sighting, but there were no physical effects.

As we kept going, we saw it hovering over a field again. We saw that it looked triangular and somewhat flat. \"We pulled over and watched, and it took off once again and we saw yellow lights now. As we followed it back the other way, it looked like it dipped and crossed the road and hovered about 60 feet above a house.

Three lights form triangle in Michigan HOLLAND — The witness reports, \"I saw two very powerful lights at 10:45 PM, on May 13, 2002, coming from what appeared to be the back of some sort of craft. It was in the sky and maybe about 600 feet from the ground. The lights resembled a pair of very bright car headlights. The craft was heading south and to the west a little. I was driving at the time, heading south, and was on a road with very little traffic, so I could speed up and try to get closer to it. \"I sped up to try to get closer, and it appeared to be slowing down. I kept watching it, and when I became parallel to it I pulled over and turned off my car. The lights were coming from the back of the craft, and there were no lights on the front. There was a less bright light above the two, creating a triangle of three lights. \"It was making some noise and the closest thing I could compare the noise to was a high pitch radio frequency. T watched it briefly, and after about 60 seconds it slowed almost to a stop. It began to go straight up and turn di- rectly around and went towards the north again. I tried to follow it again, and it quickly drifted to the west and I no longer could see it.\" The witness adds, \"I have never previously seen any objects I believe to be UFOs first hand.

According to him, the UFO had a three-dimensional body with a flat round base, similar to a reverse soup bowl. The object slowly moved over the sky towards the south, keeping the same height and speed. The object flew soundlessly, without leaving any glow or air track. According to the observer, the distance from him to the UFO was approximately 400 km, while its diameter was 10 or 15 meters. In five minutes, the object disap- peared over the houses in Kommunisticheskaya. Perm is located in central Russia near the Ural Mountains.

Smith reports strange orb type lights and cylindrical type craft over 1-64 between Richmond and Virginia Beach during the last several weeks. He says he talked to one guy in the Virginia Beach area who swears he saw a UFO land in this area. There have also been several drivers with different Virginia Trucking companies who have said they have witnessed strange things in the area while driving. \"One driver with my company claims a missing time episode of about 3 hours. I had a friend in dispatch pull up the satellite tracking report on his truck for that time. During this period of missing time his truck was stopped in the middle of the road for three hours, but no one ever saw the truck. Yet the satellite tracking report shows the truck sitting there and moving 3 hours later. \"The satellite tracking system this company uses has been known to be off by a space of about one block. The thing is, there is nowhere to pull over in this area. We had at least 15 other trucks go through this area in that time frame that never saw his truck. I know this driver; he is a very straight, level-headed guy; he is a Southern Bap- tist, but he was scared as hell. It bothered him so much he recently quit driving, and he had been driving for 18 years. The driver we are discussing has expressed an interest in finding out, if any others have had similar expe- riences? I marked the area on my map. I believe it was the mile marker 135-150 corridor.\" Thanks to V Smith.

He was featured, for example, at the 2001 MUFON symposium and at this year's Ozark UFO Conference. He is also consid- ering an update of his UFO Danger Zone — Terror and Death in Brazil, which was published in 1996. Back in the 1960s, he would have been shocked to think of himself as a future proponent of UFOs, as he was at that time a typical, no-nonsense, anti-UFO editor of a small daily newspaper in Virginia. Like most print journalists- and, in my experience, unlike most radio and TV \"journal- ists\"-!^ took a very hard line regarding anything smack- ing of the supernatural or unscientific, demanding evidence rather than popular appeal. Unfortunately, he-again like most print joumalists-never seemed to have the time or inclination to look for the evi- dence that he demanded. \"The few UFO stories that came in over the Associ- ated Press wire were tossed in the wastebasket,\" he re- calls. \"I never allowed what I thought was nonsense into the paper.\" He later worked for four other larger news- papers, but his opinion regarding UFOs did not change. \"I thought only crazy or nmuuided people believed UFOs were real,\" he says. But in 1973 he was lured away from the mainstream press by the high pay offered by the National Enquirer, one of the nation's most successful tabloids. Despite its format, the Enquirer had definite standards, including an involved system of checking reporters' stories for accu- racy. \"1 started out as a writer,\" says Pratt, \"which meant that I took the long stories turned in by reporters and boiled them down to a size we could use. Naturally, there were UFO stories, and 1 handled them-but I still thought they were silly, and I was convinced that if the reporters had simply asked the right questions the UFOs would be ex- posed as hoaxes or something easily explainable. It was galling to have to go through those stories and write them as if they were real.\" But this was about to change. Pratt switched from writing to reporting in 1975, and his editor dropped ten unfinished UFO stories on his desk and told him to work on the two most interesting cases. \"1 often wonder,\" says Bob, \"what my life would have been like if the editor had dropped this assignment on some other reporter's desk.\" One of the cases involved a farm family in Wisconsin who supposedly had seen a landed UFO, and he decided to do that one first. \"This case was to change my views on UFOs—as well as my life,\" he says. Pratt had done somewhat compelling telephone inter- views with the family prior to traveling to Wisconsin, and he received very helpful assistance from veteran UFO investigator Eugene Lundholm, a librarian and psychol- ogy lecturer at the University of Wisconsin at Superior after arriving in the area. The basic case involved a 15-year-old girl who was putting her two cats out for the night when she saw an object in the road, and went screaming into the house. Her mother, father and two of her three brothers came out and observed the object. There was noise which sounded like repairs were being made. The object took off, and the father reported the incident to the sheriff. \"Although I could never catch the farm family at home, I did talk to maybe a dozen other people related to the case, as well as 50 or 60 people who had reported sightings over the previous two years,\" recalls Pratt. \"I asked ev- ery question I could think of, and I still was not able to explain what they had seen. I was hooked.\" The former skeptic became a born-again believer. \"It was as if I were the first person to discover that UFOs are real,\" he says. \"More than 27 years later, I still have never seen a UFO, but I have talked to about 2,000 people who have.\" Pratt asked to be assigned to UFO stories for the Enquirer, and spent about 75 percent of his time over the next six years covering UFOs, traveling throughout North and South America and the Philippines. While Bob considered the extensive travel allowed and required by the Enquirer to be a perk, some was danger- ous and exhausting. On one trek into Bolivia, for ex- ample, he traveled by foot and horseback many miles over rugged terrain that no outsider had ever traversed be- fore—and he siill was not able to get the assigned story about an alleged crash of an unidentified object. \"I was halfway siiA. and I found out later that the Enquirer had not received any of my reports-and they had sent two guys out to look for me.\" One trip in the Amazon area of Brazil (after he left the Enquirer to investigate UFOs on his own) involved about 1,000 miles of travel by small plane and boat. Typi- cally, he would find himself in a Cessna with the pilot looking for a \"landing strip\" long enough and wide enough to drop into. \"I recall one landing,\" he says, \"where we came down on a semi-open strip which was supposed to be okay for landing, but it had grown up, and the wings were slapping bushes, the wheels were bouncing over ruts, and the en- gines was screaming-plus it seemed like the pilot wouldn't get the Cessna stopped before hitting trees at the end of July 2002 MUFON UFO Journal Page 15"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"Bob on his quest toi u do\\\\ned UFO in Bolnni the strip. We made it, and later took off from that same strip.\" On another occasion the pilot was forced to rum back shortly after takeoff from a remote strip when the engine begjn coughing and firing erratically. A call to the owner ot ihc aircraft resulted in the suggestion that the spark plugs be cleaned. \"This I knew how to do,\" says Pratt, \"so I cleaned the plugs. But as the pilot climbed in and revved up the engine to test it, the engine blew up com- pletely, with pieces flying down the tarmac. I had to call in an air taxi, which took me to a city large enough for a regular airliner.\" The good thing about the air taxi flight was the fact that the pilot's wife had told him about a sighting from a passenger boat. She had been smoking on the back deck when a UFO came up out of the water. Pratt adds, \"I don't know of anyone specializing in underwater UFOs, but somebody should.\" Even transportation by boat was not entirely safe in the Amazon area. \"Earlier on the same trip, we were on this boat at night going down the river with no lights,\" Bob recalls, \"except occasionally the guy running the boat would turn on a flashlight and check to see how close he was to the shore, or to check on debris in the river. But the main reason for the flashlight was to warn the big boats run- ning at a fairly high speed that we were on the river. If they didn't see us, we could quickly be run over, and they probably would not even have noticed.\" Pratt's special interest in Brazil was the result of leads provided by Leo Sprinkle and Coral Lorenzen suggesting that people were being harmed by UFOs there on a fairly regular basis. \"This sounded especially interesting,\" says Bob, \"and I went down there four times for the Enquirer, staying as long as two or three weeks. Even after leav- ing the Enquirer, he got the urge in 1986 to again visit Brazil. While not part of the plan at the time, his investi- gations in Brazil led to his book on Brazilian cases. His other major book experience resulted in Night Siege, The Hudson Valley UFO Sightings, co-authored with Dr. J. Allen Hynek and Philip Imbrogno. \"This was actually Allen's and Philip's book, but they wanted some- one else to put it together, so I did the writing from their research, although I did visit the area twice. I think Philip did about 95 percent of the research, but both of them reviewed and critiqued what I wrote. Dr. Hynek died during this process, and his wife, Mimi, took over his part of the project. Of course his name was the key to selling the book.\" Pratt was also involved with another book project with John Schuessler about the famous Cash-Landrum case. ''We could never get a publisher,\" says Bob, \"so I told John to do whatever he wanted to with it.\" It was self- published by Schuessler in 1998 with credit given to Pratt for his work on the book, and Bob wrote the introduction. Throughout his years with the Enquirer, Pratt built a network of contacts with ufologists that gave him excel- lent leads. \"Sometimes the Enquirer would pay for some of the leads,\" says Bob, \"but this did not seem to make much difference.\" In fact, it was Pratt's factual report- ing which endeared him to other researchers, despite his ties to what some people would consider a sensational tabloid. Among the researchers he worked closely with were Dr. J. Allen Hynek, Mimi Hynek, Jim Lorenzen, Coral Lorenzen, Paul Cerny, Leonard Stringfield, Dr. Gary Levine, Eugene Lundholm, and Zimbabwe's Cynthia Hind. \"I am particularly indebted to Irene Granchi of Rio de Janeiro,\" he notes. \"Almost from the beginning, Brazil's more than unusual UFO encounters have interested me, and Irene was my first contact there. Over the years she informed me ot numerous UFO happening diid, directly or indirectly, put me in touch with nearly all the other people I've worked with in Brazil. \"Cynthia Luce has also been invaluable to my re- search in Brazil. She is an American researcher who's lived in the State of Rio de Janeiro since the 1970s. We worked together on five field trips, with Cynthia making Cynthia Luce C\\nihi,i Hind, Bob Pratt, and Irene Granchi.

The following year he resigned this position to do additional writing and was replaced by Dennis Stacy. \"Despite my background as a regular journalist, and despite my strenuous efforts to present only factual ma- terial, some people still saw me as a reporter for the Na- tional Enquirer and thought I was turning the Journal into a tabloid publication,\" he recalls. In addition to his honesty and accuracy in reporting UFO incidents, Pratt has always been willing to share his reports, sometimes sending an inquiring colleague 60 pages of research on a single case-which may have received only a few inches of coverage in the Enquirer. When he decided to \"retire\" from ufology, Bob sent more than a hundred UFO books that he had collected over the years to Bob Girard, as well as nine cartons of journals and other publications to a man he worked with. He sent all of his case files, except his Brazilian cases, to John Schuessler-a treasure chest of eight or nine car- tons. Later, when he decided to put up a site on the Internet (www.bobpratt.org), he needed a few of those cases back, and Schuessler, of course, returned the requested files to Bob. As noted earlier, Pratt is considering an update of his American book on the Brazilian cases. If this occurs, he should find a large number of readers eager for the type of honest and detailed reporting that has served ufology so well over the years. Pratt has already updated the book for the Brazilian edition, which is currently being translated. It will be pub- lished by A.J. Gevaerd, editor and publisher of Brazil's leading UFO magazine, Revista UFO, and MUFON's national director for Brazil. It is expected to be released in November.

Arizona object shows lights in sequence At approximately 8:20 p.m. on May 30,2001, the wit- ness (name on file) was traveling south of Casa Grande, AZ, on Chu Chiu Road and had just gone over the over- pass on 1-8, preparing to turn east on Hannah Road. Sud- denly the surroundings became darker, despite a half moon and formerly fair visibility. Two lights described as about 6-10 feet in diameter turned on about 60 feet in the air above and to the right of the witness. These lights went out, but were followed by two more alongside the first two. These also shut off, and were followed by four lights turning on beside the last two. When these four shut off they appered to have been located on the northeast side of some object. Then eight lights on the southeast side of the object came on simultaneously and then shut off. The pattern was two, two, four, then eight. These were described as muted lights, such as would come through opaque glass, rather than spotlights, but strong enough that the witness could see the panels enclosing the lights in good detail. The witness, a welder about 33 years old, said the ob- ject appeared to be very large and dull black in color. It seemed to be hovering in place, and made no sound. Al- though the lights from the town of Chu Chiu could nor- mally be seen from that location, they were no visible during the sighting. The witness estimated the darkened area to be three stories in height, but except for the un- usual darkness, he was not aware of the object's pres- ence until the lights came on. After viewing the object for about five minutes, the witness rushed home to get two adult nephews to verify what he had seen. Upon arriving at the intersection, they discovered the object was gone, but a few minutes later they saw the same light pattern a mile or more to the south. They proceeded south on Chu Chiu Road in pur- suit, and got near enough to the object to see the details around the lights as it repeated its pattern and headed toward a mountain range to the south and disappeared. The witness reported that another auto was behind him while he viewed the object, but the occupants of that ve- hicle have not been located. The case was investigated by Ken Kerber, MUFON Field Investigator and State Section Director, Final County, AZ.

Haselhoff, Ph.D.: \".... In 1997,1 had taken samples for germination tri- als from a formation in Melick, the Netherlands...about fifteen bunches of about twenty stems each. I.. .also col- lected control samples, far outside the formation. Each individual bunch was tied together and labeled. Due to lack of time, the material... ended up in one big heap of straw on a table inside my garage. \"Several weeks later I got it out for the germination experiments. I arranged all the bunches on a table...out of each seed head I pulled single seed. When I arrived at the bunch of stems with the controls, my experiment failed immediately, even before I had a chance to plant the seeds in the germination containers. To my utter astonishment, I noted that nearly all the seed heads of the controls had disappeared. ... \"I suddenly remembered seeing a mouse in the ga- rage, a few days earlier... .underneath the table.. .1 found a generous amount of empty seed heads, along with little mouse droppings. I realized that the mouse...somehow managed to eat only the control seeds. Not a single seed sampled from inside the crop circle had been touched! \"It reminded me of an experiment that was performed in the early nineties in England. Seeds sampled from a crop circle, with the same amount of seeds sampled from somewhere else in the same field, were used to bake two loaves of bread, simultaneously, in exactly the same man- ner. The ordinary bread tasted fine; however, the \"crop circle bread\" appeared to have a bad, sharp aftertaste. \"Since a mouse's sense of smell is much better devel- oped than a human's, I could imagine that the mouse in my garage sensed that the seeds of the crop circle would taste bad, and consequently had dinner with the controls only \" A few years ago, some friends of ours (Don and LaVonna Bertelsmann, who had usually attended the monthly Southern Illinois MUFON meetings in Collinsville) gave us some samples of wheat that they had obtained from within a fresh, pristine crop circle near Edwardsvilie, IL. I ended up taking some of the crop circle wheat stalks, complete with seed heads, to one of the monthly Missouri MUFON meetings in St. Peters, MO. At that meeting, I gave a sample of the crop circle wheat to Dave Rapp, MO MUFON Assistant State Di- rector. At that same meeting, Carol Schoenholz [sp?] (who, since she lived in the area, usually attended the St. Peters, MO, MUFON meetings) asked me for a sample of the wheat so that she could attempt to propagate the seeds. Carol took the crop circle wheat sample that I had given to her and planted the seeds. She also took some of her own \"control\" wheat seeds (since I only had samples that the Bertelsmann's had obtained from within the crop circle) and planted them next to the crop circle seeds.: Carol later told me that rabbits had gotten into the planted patch and had eaten ALL the \"control\" wheat she had planted. BUT, the rabbits did NOT eat ANY of the crop circle wheat that had propagated right next to the control wheat!       >   - -Bob Soetebier Pre-Arnold airships Both Fred Vamer [March 2002] and Ken Larson [May 2002] appear totally unaware of Jerome Clark's The UFO Encyclopedia, 2nd Edition. So it is not surprising they are unaware of the amount of airship/ufo data predating the Ken Arnold sighting. Australia's Bill Chalker contrib- utes a report in Clark's work on \"Airships in Australia and New Zealand\" [ Vol 1, pgs 42-44, with additional ref- erences, while Clark's own entry on \"UFOs: 1900-1946\" in Vol 2, pgs 916-938, goes into considerable detail on pre-Amold sightings. I might also note that The History of Aviation in New Zealand by Ewing and Macpherson [Heineman, NZ, 1986: pg 28] carries more detailed information on NZ's 1909 airship sightings [including eyewitness sketches] and gives those reports greater credence than does Chalker. I would recommend that the editor of this journal keep Clark's Encyclopedia close at hand to allow for quick vetting of all future articles which might, if checked against Clark's work, display correctable deficiencies. This would not only improve the accuracy of Journal articles but would serve to confound ufological skeptics. -George W.

This is a region of the southern Pennines in and around the picturesque town of Matlock, Derbyshire. Not only have strange lights been wit- nessed here, but some video footage has been exercising the minds of many UFOlogists. . Windows This area is part of what is called the Peak District Na- tional Park, a region of undu- lating hills and narrow gorges towards the southern end of the Pennines-a range of hills often known as the \"backbone of England\" because it runs Jenny Randies like a spine down the center of the island across about 100 miles of the country. It separates the old kingdoms of the roses-the white rose of Yorkshire to the east and the red rose of Lancashire to the west-and old rivalries between these ancient regions still surface in the moorland villages and nearby urban areas that encompass major cities such as Manchester, Leeds and Sheffield. This area has long been recognised by British UFOlogists as one of the most active windows in Eu- rope. Indeed some statistics that I have worked on for my book on the area (Supernatural Pennines, Robert Hale, London, 2002) show that you are 12 times more likely to have an encounter in these often sparsely popu- lated moorlands than you are anywhere else in the UK. I will have more to say on this analysis next month, as it is unlikely this book will reach a US audience. Each part of the Pennine Window has an association with different types of phenomena, and the Derbyshire peaks seem to be linked with almost Star Trek-like time and space distortions. There are countless sightings of what appear to be time slip replays of events from World War Two (the famous Dambuster Raids were prepared for in local reservoirs) and many other curiosities of this nature-including, believe it or not, several well attested sightings of a pterosaur (a flying dinosaur!). Humming Hills Another oddity of this area is the prevalence of hum- ming noises coming from the hills themselves. The rocks literally sing with a strange high pitched noise. There are several hotspots of this, but an interesting one is near the small settlement of Winster, just five miles west of Matlock. One witness described to me what she experienced here: \"It was as if the hillside itself was vibrating...a pleasant humming like an orchestra was tuning up on one note.\" This hum is also reported on Ilkley Moor, an active location further north where both UFOs and alien con- tacts have been reported in some numbers-including the infamous photograph of a little green man that was taken by an abductee at the conclusion to his abduction . A number of the witnesses to these sounds have told me that they think the hum is emerging from the ground and has the form of a vibration within the rocks, which do often have a high quartz crystal content. Indeed there are reliable reports of people getting mild electric shocks from touching some of the taller standing stones, and even well attested cases of reverse lightning-forks of glowing blue energy emerging from the ground. A good example of this occurred at Totley, about 15 miles north of Matlock, where a three-pronged fork of little balls of light climbed from exposed rock outcrops and entered the sky on a non-stormy day. The UFO activity Although, to me, this background is essential knowl- edge when considering the UFO activity in and around Matlock, it has (I fear) never been considered by any of the journalists or UFOlogists-including some from the US and Japan-who have been attracted by the recent spate of sightings in the Peak District. These began to build up in the fall of 2000, but sporadic reports have continued ever since. It is fair to note that they rarely involve anything much beyond glowing lights that move across the horizon, but they do include lights in formation, sometimes reported as being on the undersides of large triangular craft. That said, in some of the wit- nesses that I have spoken to, the dark shape is inferred rather than clearly seen-in effect to \"connect the dots,\" so to speak, by making the subconscious assumption that these moving lights must be on some otherwise unseen darkened craft. There are some explanations on offer. The area is on a flightpath into Manchester Airport, and because of the altitude low flying aircraft-especially when their engines are throttled back late at night due to severe noise restric- tions-can seem strange. I live 20 miles from Matlock at 1000 ASL and have witnessed such things often. Also, the aircraft are, of course, much lower relative to your altitude . Since many witnesses are on a busy road (the A 6) that passes through the peaks at night, they tend to be July 2002 MUFON UFO Journal Page 19"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"unaware of their proximity to air traffic because Manches- ter Airport is much further away by road than it is as the jumbo flies. Moreover, there are two other sources of unusual air activity (even if one leaves out the hang gliders, gliders, and hot air balloons that are common here in summer). Military exercises, some involving low flying, troop trans- porting and helicopter rescue, do occur. And there is an airbase called Woodford, which builds aircraft, and sev- eral times a year sees giant Russian transport aircraft pass over whilst ferrying wings. I have more than once resolved in this way what even to local residents seem to be puzzling low level, huge, and slow moving objects. That said, the past history and associated window area phenomena of this location must have a part to play in some of the sightings, regardless of how we ultimately explain precisely what is going on within such a hotbed of UFO activity. The big one The case that has grabbed the most attention from the Matlock area centers on the village of Bonsall (midway between Matlock and Winster). It has been reported that a US TV network has paid a lot of money to secure some video footage captured by a local woman on 5 October 2000, although I doubt if this network has much of an idea as to the context into which to properly place this story. Having looked into some of the reports that were stimu- lated by the publicity surrounding this video, I am positive that many of them are misperceptions. Some proved to be aircraft, and many were the planets Venus and Jupi- ter-then bright-but I do not suggest that all the local sightings are easily explicable. I would be sure that a few are a consequence of the window area activity that this location clearly reflects. As for the video itself, sadly I am not persuaded that this will change the face of UFOlogy. In fact it shows what is described as a gigantic object, basically circular, but with a bite cut out from one side, that hovered near Bonsall. However, the video may bear much less of a relationship to what was actually present than you might imagine. In fact, the size of the object is, I suspect, an artefact of the focus of the camcorder. It appears to be failing to lock onto a point source of light and so reveals an en- larged, out of focus image. The \"bite\" is a direct conse- quence of part of the internal camera system being re- vealed by superimposition onto this out-of-focus effect. So, what resembles a massive flying saucer is in truth quite possibly a much smaller light (such as a star or planet) that the camera is distorting as a result of its optical limi- tations. I know (because they have told me!) that many UK media sources, and witnesses and other UFOlogists con- sider this suggestion to be the \"outrageous nonsense ut- tered by a debunker,\" as one phrased it after I first sug- gested this possibility soon after the case surfaced. And, I should make clear, this is my opinion of this case only. I could, of course, be wrong, and am certainly making no intimation whatsoever of impropriety on the case of the witness. She clearly saw (via the viewfmder) exactly what she filmed, and is sincerely puzzled by it. All I am offering is a likely explanation for what was there. . However, this is not debunking-merely an expression of a caution that I believe needs to be applied to this par- ticular case. In no sense am I suggesting that the US TV company should not be paying this witness big bucks to use her film; she should quite properly get whatever they are willing to pay for its use. But I am suggesting that I have seen several similar pieces of video film of late from all over the UK, and these-according to the analysis we did and (more importantly) the views of photographic ex- perts-turned out to be explained in this way. As such, any serious investigation of what is going on in Bonsall needs to take this possibility into account. Which is not to say that there are no local UFOs crossing the skies of this area. I would be amazed if there were not. And it is not to say that video evidence of them can- not be captured. Self evidently it can be, and within a window area such as the Pennines you are far more likely to be successful than elsewhere. But what it is to say is that all evidence, regardless of how spectacular it looks on a TV screen, has to be re- garded on the premise that it is more likely to have an explanation than not—for that is the basic home truth of UFO investigation. Most UFOs turn out to be IFOs. Even ones with photographic or video evidence. Jupiter-like planet located outside our solar system By Robert Roy Britt SPACE.COM A team of astronomers on June 13 announced the discovery of the first planet outside our solar system with an orbit similar to Jupiter's, a con- figuration that has the potential to support an Earth- like planet. They also found the least massive world ever detected around another star, a planet just 40 times as heavy as Earth. The primary discovery is a gas giant planet that circles a star called 55 Cancri every 13 years, comparable to Jupiter's 11.86-year orbit. The planet is between 3.5 and 5 times as heavy as Jupiter. \"It's the first extrasolar planet that reminds us of a planet in our solar system,\" lead researcher Geoffrey Marcy said in an interview with Space.com. Marcy, of the University of California at Berkeley, said he and colleague Paul Butler, of the Carnegie Institution of Washington, have dreamed of this discovery for 17 years.

Af- ter the war, he went back to teach physics at Chicago, and this was one of the reasons I transferred there in 1953. He had exploratory surgery in late 1954 and died 6 weeks later of cancer that had been found, but could not be treated. He was, judging by the reactions of my other physics profs, a physicist's physicist. He was equally at home with theoretical and experimental work. The US Govern- ment even issued a postage stamp in 2001 to commemo- rate the 100th anniversary of his birth. The story goes that Fermi, in many discussions with his associates at Los Alamos, had noted that it shouldn't take very long, perhaps 10 million years, for any advanced civilization to colonize the whole galaxy, which is about 1000 times older than the colonization time. His question was \"So where are they?\" or \"So where is everybody?\" SETI Specialists and others have interpreted his com- ments as meaning that since we obviously haven't been colonized, either there is nobody else out there or they must be out there and we just have to listen long enough with better and better equipment and we will discover them. Both groups assume Fermi was saying nobody is com- ing here. I don't think that is true. Fermi was famous for his teaching skills, and often asked questions to get stu- dents and colleagues to think through difficult problems. Obviously there are many possible answers, such as \"We are the remnants of colonies planted here thousands or millions of years ago.\" One would think they expected an advanced civilization to land and make a beeline for the nearest pub or TV station or SETI Institute. Perhaps Earth is a penal colony at which they dumped bad guys and girls-sort of the Devil's island of this corner of the galaxy. They certainly would not have been left a means for escaping. Georgia and Australia were first settled by prisoners. One popular answer from some of Fermi's close asso- ciates: \"They did colonize earth, and we Hungarians (Teller, Szilard, etc) are they.\" Hungarian is a language like no other on Earth. A number of brilliant scientists were Hun- garian Another answer, and the one I prefer, is \"governments have collected all kinds of data in secret, including crashed saucers and alien bodies, proving that they (aliens) have been coming here, but do not want to tell us because of the potential technological advantage that might accrue... And the possible reduction in power if the people on the planet start thinking of themselves as Earthlings.\" Certainly Fermi and his associates working on the Manhattan Project knew that secrets could be kept. They were helping to keep them. Los Alamos was a secret city. It didn't even get mail, but used a PO Box in Santa Fe. Scientists travelled under phoney names. That chain reaction at the U. of Chicago was an extraordinary sci- entific achievement, but there was no publication in sci- entific journals and no press coverage. Dr. Michael Hart, a professor at Trinity College, and a small group of followers did a lot of modeling about Earth, making all kinds of assumptions having no basis in fact, and concluded that the conditions here were so special for the development of life, that those conditions have never existed anywhere else, and we are the only civili- zation in the universe!! He took the Fermi Paradox to mean that since there are no colonists here, there has never been any other civilization anyplace else!! Dr. Frank Drake, president of the SETI Institute, looks at things differently. In Is Anyone out There? (Frank Drake and Dava Sobel, Delacorte Press, 1992). \"There are several solutions to this Fermi Paradox, for the \"fact\" that \"they\" are not here does not prove that \"they\" do not exist,\" Drake states. Not the slightest basis is given for the \"fact\" that they are not here. No reference to the enormous amount of data indicating they are. He continues, \"I don't believe we will receive visits from other planets of other stars...any more than I be- lieve we have been visited in the past by ancient astro- nauts or UFOs that are alien spacecraft... .They are there in great numbers for us to find—via their radio transmis- sions. That is why I have pushed continuously over the July 2002 MUFON UFO Journal Page 21"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"years for the construction of larger, ever more sensitive receivers, the better to hear those signals.\" Not only does he believe that nobody is coming here, but that they are out there and are stuck at the level of radio!! Evidence provided? NONE. Seth Shostak, a SETI specialist colleague of Drake, claims in a recent internet piece that \"Fermi thought there was obvious proof that we could be alone in the Galaxy.\" I can't find any evidence for this conviction. Shostak says, \"We seem to have the Galaxy to ourselves. At least that is the obvious conclusion from the apparent lack of aliens in the neighborhood.\" I suppose the aliens haven't called Seth or Frank, but so what. Why should they? Shostak says, \"The evidence for alien visitation has failed to sway most scientists. To convince researchers who are inherently sceptical, unambiguous and repeated detection of flying objects by satellites or ground-based radar would be required. Better yet would be some indis- putable physical evidence such as the landing lights. In other words something better than witness testimony is necessary since such testimony isn't good enough no matter how credible the witness.\" This is a truly incredible and unscientific claim. In the first place there are a whole host of excellent radar and radar-visual cases, such as the many investigated by Dr. James E. MacDonald. There are more than 5000 physi- cal trace cases that Ted Phillips has collected from 70 countries. In addition, of course, is the simple fact that the best air and ground radar cases involve measurements by our best military radar and satellite surveillance systems. Their data is born classified. The data from the spy satellites operated by the National Reconnaissance Office is born classified and rarely declassified... and certainly not sent to the SETI specialists. Our entire legal system involving evaluation of events involved with intelligent people is based on witness testi- mony. Murders, rapes, airplane crashes, UFO landings, aren't reproducible, controllable experiments. They are out in the real world. Absence of evidence in the hands of the SS certainly isn't evidence for absence of that data. The most significant characteristic of the comments made about UFOs by Drake, Shostak, Jill Tartar, the late Carl Sagan, et al is the total lack of referral to the large scale scientific UFO studies. At my lectures \"Flying Sau- cers ARE Real\" I discuss 5 large scale scientific studies and ask, after showing slides of each, how many (many of my audiences are loaded with professional engineers and scientists) have read this volume? Typically only 1 or 2% have read any. In short, SETI Specialists are basically saying, \"It is OK to theorize in a way that justifies the work I am doing, but don't bother me with the facts; my mind is made up.\" Obviously this applies to their many foolish comments about \"you can't get here from there.\" One would think all civilizations were stuck with chemi- cal rocket technology along with radio systems like ours. The SETI Specialists forget that technological progress comes from doing things differently in an unpredictable way. The Fermi Paradox doesn't establish that nobody is coming here. It forces us to recognize that they could have come here ages ago, could be coming here now, and that most of us wouldn't be aware of past or present visits. Shostak further says, \"SETI Experiments offer the promise of relegating the Fermi Paradox to the dustbin of historical curiosities by proving that other intelligence is out there.\" One would think he could get aliens to send and respond on his command! In the real world, it is study- ing the enormous volume of UFO data that establishes that other intelligence is coming here, even though \"they\" are apparently not visiting the SETI specialists.

Automatically generated UFO reports now online By Don Weatherby & Wendy Ban MUFON/WUFOD The first automatically generated reports from WUFOD are now online. You can reach them through links off the MUFON home page ( http:// www.mufon.com), from the login screen for WUFOD at (http://ohiomufon.services4all.com), or directly at http:// ohiomufon.services4all.com/wufrptlinks.html (The link on the MUFON home page indicates \"WUFOD Reports\" or some such.) Recently I removed most of the noise from the data base, and got rid of bogus cases, hoaxes, and duplicates. There may be a couple yet in there, either known or un- known. Nonetheless, the cases are a combination of raw reports from the public ( about 60% ) and fully investi- gated cases making up the rest. The patterns are interesting, and I hope that some of you will drop me a line with any insights into analyzing these reports. There is a statistics person who I will send them to, and will review them in the raw statistical sense. But I am very curious what you all conclude from the obvious \"clumping\" of data at various points. The reports simply compare data matches for the two chosen fields, i.e., color/shape. So, the color/shape report will indicate the number of blue oval shaped UFOs, etc. Many more reports are forthcoming; have to debug a few things. Enjoy.

(Southern observers have a better view.) Our brilliant planetary neighbor reaches its farthest point E of the Sun on the 22nd. The planet may be seen near the crescent Moon on Aug. 11 and near the 1 st-magnitude star Spica on the 31st. Bright Planets (Morning): Jupiter (-1.8), in Cancer, emerges in the morning sky, rising in the ENE about 4 AM (midmonth). By the end of August, the giant world is in better view in the E at dawn. Saturn (0.1), in Taurus, rises in the NE about 1:30 AM (mid-August) and is fairly high in the eastern sky by dawn. The ringed planet can be found near the lunar crescent on the 5th. Meteor Shower: Unlike the past two years, the Perseid meteor shower can be viewed this time in a moonless sky during its peak on Aug. 13. Although the shower's radiant point lies above the northern horizon all night, it is highest toward dawn when the maximum rate of up to 100 meteors per hour is expected. Both the swifter Perseids (coming from the NE) and the slower Aquarids (from the S) cross the heav- ens in lesser numbers throughout the 1st half of August. Moon Phases: Last quarter-Aug. 1 New moon-Aug. 8 First quarter-Aug. 15 Full moon-Aug. 22 Last quarter-Aug. 30 The Stars: After twilight ends, the Summer Triangle stands out high in the S. Vega, that \"arc light\" of the sky, lies almost overhead on the celestial meridian at 10 PM. It is located at one corner of the Triangle, while Deneb and Altair form the other two corners E and SE of Vega. Also on the meridian but much lower in the S is Sagit- tarius the Archer, the half-man, half-horse centaur of myth who aims his arrow at the venomous Scorpius. Look at Sagittarius as a teapot, with handle to the left, triangular lid in the center, and spout to the right. In the NW the Big Dipper heads toward the horizon, while in the NE the crooked \"W\" of Cassiopeia the Queen can easily be discerned. Director's Message...

Schuessler MUFON International Director Celebrate National UFO Information Week MUFON members everywhere are urged to sponsor or participate in UFO Awareness activities during Na- tional UFO Information Week Aug. 18-24, 2002. Al- though public attention to the UFO problem has been di- verted away from UFOs by all of the upsetting world events during the past nine months, UFOs are still being seen and reported. The mystery has not been solved. Therefore, it is time to refocus public attention on this important subject. Individuals, groups, consult- ants and state units can provide UFO information at the grass roots level by holding meetings, appearing on radio and televi- sion programs, speaking to ser- vice groups and clubs, making press releases to local news- papers, featuring local MUFON representatives at shopping malls, conducting fund raisers with the proceeds go- ing to giving MUFON UFO Journal gift subscriptions to li- _ . _. . braries and schools, and lots of John Schuessler other events. The list of possibilities is endless. Colorado MUFON is planning a full day of activities on Aug. 24 at the shopping center where the MUFON Headquarters is located. Lin Simpson, acting state di- rector, says the activities will include press briefings, UFO movies, lectures, live music on the parking lot, food and more. Recruiting new MUFON members and MUFON UFO Journal subscribers as well as alerting the public where to report UFO sightings are the goals of the event. All of the businesses in the shopping center are primed to participate and are excited about it. Also on Aug. 24, Stan Gordon will set up a UFO ex- hibit at the Westmoreland Mall located on Route 32 East in Greensburg, Pennsylvania. MUFON Headquarters would like feedback on all of your UFO Awareness ac- tivities so we can determine the extent of the impact of the activities.
