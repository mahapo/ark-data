In addition to our excellent lineup of speak- ers like Stanton Friedman, Richard Dolan, Timothy Good, Kathleen Marden, Robert Salas, Michael Nelson, Dr. Rudy Schild, Sam Maranto, Brad Sparks, John Greenewald, and George Knapp, MUFON will also have on display for the first time ever, copies of the negatives of the McMinnville, Oregon, UFO photos. Taken in 1950 by the Trent family, the photos are the only ones that have been authenticated by a body of scientific analysts. The Condon Committee concluded: “This is one of the few UFO reports in which all factors investigated—geometric, psychological, and physical—appear to be consistent with the assertion that an extraordinary flying object, silvery, metallic, disk-shaped, tens of meters in diameter, and evidently artificial, flew within sight of two witnesses. It can- not be said that the evidence positively rules out a fabrication, although there are some physical factors such as the accuracy of certain photometric measures of the original negatives which argue against a fabrication.” Also at the 2007 Symposium we will once again be running a silent auction.

Does this look like a flying saucer? With the approaching 60 th anniver- sary of the 1947 Roswell Incident upon us, I’ve noticed the internet UFO forums are active with discus- sions by those who dispute established information about two aspects of the incident, specifically pertaining to 1) the debris found on the Foster ranch by ranch foreman William “Mack” Brazel, and 2) the photographs taken in General Ramey’s office. Both of these key elements of the incident, in my estimation, have been “put to rest” several times with good research and factual information, but the critics and non-believers appar- ently don’t want to accept factual information, even though they have no new or counter information to offer. The debate continues. Regarding the question of the debris—was it from a weather balloon or something else?—I will rely on the research of David Rudiak ( http:// roswellproof.com ) and a few others who devoted countless hours to research and documentation. Regarding the photographs taken in General Ramey’s office, I speak from first-hand knowledge from personal interviews of James Bond Johnson, the photographer of all but one of the photographs. I was able to seriously question him about some of his statements and his embellishments of his involvement as expressed in interviews done previously by David Rudiak, Kevin Randle and others. Brazel knew weather balloons On June 14, 1947, a ranch fore- man, William “Mack” Brazel spotted some wreckage on the ranch, which he later showed to Major Jesse Marcel and counter intelligence officer S. Cavitt. Ranch foreman “Mack” Brazel was familiar with weather balloons, having prior to July 1947 recovered several and turned them in to the Army-Air Force for the small reward offered. Would the top intelligence officer in the military at the time (Major Jesse Marcel), be asked to go 65 miles away from the base with CIC operative Captain Cavitt to review the situationonaranchifthewreckage was from a balloon? Would they themselves bring debris back to the base, and shortly thereafter have Marcel fly some of that debris to 8 th Army-Air Force headquarters in Fort Worth, Texas, for General Ramey to view if it appeared to be from a balloon? Would that same debris then beflownontoWrightFieldatDayton, Ohio, if it was only a balloon? And why in 1994—47 years later—would the Air Force publish a report indicating that what was found on the Foster ranch in 1947 was not a flying saucer as reported by the media July 8, 1947—after the base press release—nor was it a weather balloon as General Ramey reported in the media the next day on July 9, 1947, but rather a Mogul balloon? Mogul balloons (see illustration) were intended to detect any future nuclear testing being done by the Russians as observed from high altitude, so the Mogul balloons were being launched to see if they could be kept at a constant high altitude level. To the critics and non-believers it doesn’t matter that the Russians didn’t do any nuclear testing until 1949, (two years after the Roswell Incident). Finally, if the Mogul balloons were such a secret, why was a phony Mogul launch carried out for the press at Alamogordo on July 9, 1947, the day after the flying disc press release? We’re certainly due another excuse by the Air Force, after the four we’ve already had. The Mogul 4 balloon, which some claim was the debris found on the ranch, seems to be the only unac- counted-for Mogul balloon launch that fits the time frame. However, accord- ing to a diary kept by one of the Mogul scientists, Flight 4 was cancelled due to cloud cover, which is also supported By Dennis Balthasar Continued on page 4"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"July 2007 4 MUFON UFO Journal James Bond Johnson and Dennis Balthaser by weather records of that time. Flight 9onJuly3 rd was also cancelled. Neither Flight 4 nor 9 are listed in the Mogul records kept for each launch. If a flight was cancelled, the balloons already filled with helium would be simply released because they couldn’t be reused. Any reusable equipment (radiosondes, radar reflectors) used for tracking would have been removed from the balloon train before releasing the balloons. Such a balloon release would have no value and would not typically be tracked. Charles Moore, Mogul Engineer, claimed Flight 4 was tracked (based only on his memory), but has never produced any substantial documenta- tion to support it. As a matter of note, none of the equipment that would have been attached to a Mogul balloon was ever reported as being found at the debris field either. David Rudiak and others have re-calculated the trajec- tory of Flight 4, and Rudiak has indicated that Moore’s calculations for the trajectory would have missed the Fosterranchby70miles,whileothers indicate 17 miles away from the ranch, either one being a long distance from the debris site. Besides Mogul balloons with occasional radar targets, weather balloons with radar targets were also launched from a weather station at Orogrande, south ofAlamogordo, prior to the launching of V-2 rockets from White Sands. But neither a single balloon with a radar target nor a much larger Mogul balloon train with track- ing and other equipment would explain the size of the debris field, described as being several hundred yards wide by ¾ of a mile long. Over the years much has been said about the “flower tape” suppos- edly holding parts of the Mogul radar target equipment together, but none has ever been seen in the photos taken in General Ramey’s office by James Bond Johnson, strongly indicating the debris in General Ramey’s office wasn’t even part of a Mogul balloon assembly. Photographer James Bond Johnson That brings me to photographer James Bond Johnson. There has been controversy over the photographs he took in General Ramey’s office, reportedly of the Roswell debris delivered there by Major Marcel. Furthermore, in various interviews, Johnson apparently embellished his involvement. Ihavemadeafewobservations about the photographs that I want to share with you. The brown wrapping paper on the floor in several of the photographs with the debris on top of it appears to me to have been re- moved from a new roll of brown wrapping paper. Its flat surface indicates that the paper was never a part of a wrapped up package brought to the General’s office by Major Marcel, as it would have had creases or been crumpled from being wrapped around the debris material. Secondly, and again in several photographs, unopened packages are plainly visible, possibly being some of the debris Marcel brought, and not yet opened. If Major Marcel went into the map room with the General when he arrived in Fort Worth before the packages were opened as I understand it, did Johnson take it upon himself to open some of the packages? He told me he rear- ranged the pile of debris for the photo shoot. Part of my 2001 interview with Johnson is presented here.

JBJ: I was assigned by my city editor, Cullum Greene... [He] was quite concerned when he had just received a “flash” AP teletype alert message that a “captured” flying saucer was being flown from the Roswell Army Air Forces Base to the Eighth Air Force headquarters of General Roger Ramey located at Fort Worth Army Air Field and he was very eager to obtain photos of the craft... DGB: For the record, I understand that you took six photographs (three different setups) on July 8, 1947 in General Ramey’s office, including General Ramey alone, General Ramey and Colonel DuBose and Maj. Jesse Marcel. Agreed? JBJ: Yes. DGB: You have indicated that you do not remember meeting or taking photographs of Major Marcel in Ramey’s office, but rather believe you did take them after looking at the negatives at the library of the Univer- sity of Texas at Arlington [where they are archived], based on the markings on the film that was used for the other photographs you did take. Agreed? JBJ: Yes, upon examination of the available four original negatives housed in the Special Collections wing of the UTA Library I was able to confirm that the films all have identical edge coding and so would have come from the same “batch” of film. Also, the negatives are still filed in their original manila negative files which include the original typed photo captions. ... It is believed that I furnished [the] fifth negative to a photo service on the night of July 8, 1947. The sixth negative—of Ramey alone that ran in the Star- Telegram on July 10, 1947— has not been located. There has been some speculation that this negative was confis- cated by the government since it probably shows in clearest detail the debris pieces in the photos. DGB: The photograph of Irving Newton (weather officer at Fort Worth Army Air Field, at right ) was not taken by you,... agreed? JBJ: Agreed. ... JBJ: It has been widely specu- lated—and I have no reason to challenge—that the Newton shot was taken some time after my departure to be released along with the official “weather balloon” explanation person- ally announced on Fort Worth radio station WBAP by General Ramey a short time after I had departed his office. It was stated by Colonel DuBose shortly before his death that Ramey was ordered by his superiors to announce the “weather balloon” cover-up story “to get the press off our backs.” When I asked Johnson about the unopened packages on the floor, he said, “there hadn’t been time to open Searching for the Truth Contined from page 4 them all, and what was opened was in a pile, so I rearranged it for the photo shoot.” Johnson had made a statement that the paper in General Ramey’s hand in the photographs was a press releasethathehadhandedtoRamey. In my interview with Johnson he admitted he was in error about that. Bottom line for James Bond Johnson is that he did take six photo- graphs in General Ramey’s office, but not the one of Irving Newton, and he had no other involvement, although he embellished his involvement in various interviews he had done.

P s e u d o s c i e n c e At the 2002 MUFON Symposium, Mr.Sainiogaveapresentationon TheScientificConnections in Photo/Video Ufology. An excerpt follows: Assume two west-facing photos of a beach at sunset, with an airborne disk appearing, are being examined. The photographer and friend claimed to see the object fly by. What characteristics about the photos can be tested? 1. People normally center an interesting object in a photo. Is the disk cen- tered? If not, is there an explanation? 2. Sunset sky behind the disk will give glare, slightly reddening the edges of the disk. Theorize the disk is real, as opposed to an altered negative. Is glare found? 3. People in the photos are silhouetted by the sun, making them appear black regardless of clothing. Thus, the blackness is largely independent of actual color. The disk should be similar, except for lightening due to atmospheric haze. The lightening should be dependent on distance. Are the allegedly-more-distant disk images lighter than the people? 4. Both the people and disks should be distant objects. Both should have similar focus. Is this the case? Except for the first, none of these questions have visually obvious an- swers. Scanning and measurement are needed. Now assume a video is submitted of a hovering object, which zips off. The video is shot through a window. The object is clearly not an ordinary aerial object, but seems like it could be a bobber hanging on a monofilament line off a rooftop fishing pole, which is then yanked. What theories could be tested? 1. The window edge is a usable refer- ence. Does the UFO motion match a control experiment using a bobber/ line/monofilament? 2. Do the video control signals best match the poor quality typical of a home camcorder, or studio equip- ment? 3. Is the focus appropriate for a distant object? In this situation, the only other object for comparison is the relatively-near window edge. The poor quality of video makes this experiment unworkable. Detection of the monofilament would also probably be pointless. Despite the (assuming real) irre- producibility of these cases, useful tests of unobvious characteristics of the evidence can be made. Other re- searchers may duplicate any of the tests, and should get the same results. Pseudoscientists abusing science Then there are pseudoscientists, who abuse science in the following ways (and probably more): 1. Failure to perform control mea- surements: This is practically a universal ID of the pseudoscientist. Control experi- ments are tedious and boring, but are required to compare the testing of the “unknown” with similar testing of the “known,” unless the “known” test is so familiar as to be unnecessary. ManydegreedUfologistsfailtodo controls, and as will be shown later, their stunning results become quite ordinary when controls are per- formed. For instance, a PhD ufologist pointed out that a UFO in a video was larger than a mere point, and made conclusions based on this large angular size. However, a control was available—the constellation Orion was visible. Its stars, which are point sources, appeared the same size as the “large” UFO. The true source of the UFO angular size was the relatively low quality of the camera focus. The researcher’s conclusions were meaningless. 2. Failure to perform any measure- ments or experiments at all: IhappentobeanFCC-licensed broadcast engineer, and the saying in this field is “eyes and ears are not FCC-accepted test equipment.” Proper scientific reports are gener- ally filled with tables, charts, or graphs showing the numeric mea- surements taken. If the data are noisy, measurements are taken multiple times, and “error bars” also appear in the graphs, to show the uncertainty of the measurements. In contrast, the pseudoscientist often doesn’t know how to experiment or measure or analyze, or finds that the result contradicts a pet theory. He just says “wow” to the data, or doesn’t even have any data. Often, the pseudoscientist is simply lazy. 3. Leaping tall buildings to conclu- sions: Pseudoscientists often display a heavy bias toward their favorite theory (which may not even explain the case), ignoring conventional explanations (which will explain the case). For example, a distant airborne object, which fades out of visibility, is presumed to disappear into another dimension, rather than simply being lost in haze. The bias often involves selection of evidence (the best examples which support his case, contrasted with the poorest evidence"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"7 MUFON UFO Journal July 2007 Continued on page 8 Continued from page 6 VideoandPhotoAnalysis for the competing theory). The ancient Greek phrase post hoc, ergo propter hoc (after the fact, therefore caused by the fact) which implies a leap to conclusions is often used. With great mysteries so easily solved, further conclusions about UFO origins, construction, power source, and crew sizes are announced, with completely inadequate supporting data. 4. Use of science that they are insufficiently trained in, combined with a failure to verify their conclusions with somebody who is : At my first MUFON Symposium, a crop-circle researcher told of statisti- cally-significantly lower beta-radia- tion readings inside a circle, then hypothesized that the lower pH of that soil provided more protons to absorb the oppositely-charged radiation. The statistics appeared impressive, but any college-freshman chemistry student would know that the lower pH translates to a trivial increase in H3O+, and any junior physics student would know that beta-rays (energetic electrons) are moving too fast to be significantly affected by molecular charge. The study obviously wasn’t checked by a chemist or physicist beforehand. Such sophomoric errors are common, and repel scientists from the field. Eminent scientific journals are peer- reviewed; a study is scrutinized by another researcher prior to publica- tion. Peer-review has its own prob- lems of course, such as delay and peer-bias. 5. Misuse of the reducto ad absur- dum method of logic : Reducto ad absurdum , or reducing to the absurd, is a line of reasoning which has an absurd conclusion; therefore, one or more of the reasoning’s initial assumptions must be wrong. UFO “researchers” often fail to perform control experiments, and many absurdities result from control experiments based on their “logic.” Note that the absurdity does not tell which initial assumption is wrong. Debunkers often implicitly add assumptions to a case, then use reducto ad absurdum to debunk the case. But the absurdity derives from the assumptions of the debunker! Such a “successful” debunker distorts the facts, attacks the distor- tion, and succeeds in proving himself wrong. Do not assume that Ufologists are wild speculators, and that debunkers are calm scientists. I’ve seen more nonscience from debunkers than Ufologists. 6. Lumping independent cases together. Readers have probably seen books claiming to have “the explanation” for all UFO cases. About half my submitted cases are of the planet Venus, and many others are clearly airplanes.Asingle explanation for thousands of UFO cases is as ludicrous as a single cause for every car crash. Pseudoscientists are often more interested in simplicity or their pet theory, than in explaining the evidence. 7. Utter nonlogic such as use of emotion rather than logic: This includes circular logic (assuming that a statement is true, to prove the statement true); conclusions which contradict the assumptions or data they are derived from; name-calling; or advocating double-standards, censorship, intimidation, or character assassination of their critics. Charac- ter assassination, or personal attack, is used by pseudoscientists to divert attention away from their failed logic, and toward some alleged failure of the person with competing reasoning. The use of personal attack is a signal the attacker’s case is inadequate. Attackers fail to understand that their critic’s personal character is irrel- evant; if the competing reasoning is scientific, anybody may verify it. Scientific reports often use third- person writing, using “the experiment was performed” rather than “I experimented” to emphasize that science methods, not people, are the core of the work. The amount of nonlogic in Ufology, and debunking, is appalling. 8. In the field of video/photo analy- sis, inappropriate “enhance- ments” or blowups are often seen on TV shows: One must remember that TV produc- ers’ goal is not science, but ratings. (One of the videos in this paper was TV-analyzed by actresses and pro- fessional wrestlers!) If such blowups actually revealed more details, one could do a blowup/enhancement to reveal Agent Scully’s face in the open trunk of the getaway car. Another blowup would recognize the skin cells present.Another blowup would sequence the DNA bases in the cells, and another blowup to determine the electron shells around theatoms,withafinalblowuptosee the quarks comprising the atomic nucleus. No electron microscopes or particle accelerators would be needed. Blowups only work that way on TV. No enhancement of a photo can determine the three-dimensional shape of an un-known object. Very few blowups on TV are meaningful. Nor are TV shows complete or unbiased. Typi-cally, an hour of interview is behind every minute in the final edit. A researcher carefully covering the pros and cons of a case, will usually find only one side surviv- ing to the airwaves; the more exciting side. However, such TV appearances are essential in obtaining cases from the public."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"July 2007 8 MUFON UFO Journal VideoandPhotoAnalysis Continued from page 7 Continued on page 9 Fact, Faked or Fooled At least the theories about a UFO case are generally categorized as: 1. The UFO is “fact,” a real, perhaps metallic, unconventional flying object with extraordinary speed, accelera- tion, lack of wings, etc.; 2. The UFO is “faked,” by a person attempting deception; 3. The UFO is “fooled,” a sincere witness is misidentifying an ordinary phenomenon. Categories 2 and 3 may be com- bined; a faker may launch a lighted balloon, and sincere witnesses may report it. Note that this list does not contain a category involving UFOs appearing from the future, from other dimensions, etc. Since there are no currently known methods of time travel or going to other dimensions (whatever that means), such “explanations” replace unknowns with other un- knowns, with no advancement of knowledge. Researchers making such claims are probably too tangled in unknowns to make any meaningful advances. As the MUFON Staff Photo- analysts, colleague Bruce Maccabee and I have the luxury of analyzing the “hardest” evidence available, at least until a UFO crashes into the lawn of MUFON headquarters. Photographs and videotapes allow repeatable measurement, and contain a wealth of information, much of it not immediately evident, and some of it not even visible. Applying the Scientific Method to UFO cases In this paper, I will demonstrate the scientific method as it applies to the analysis of UFO cases. Perhaps a quarter of my submitted cases contain too little information for useful analysis. For the rest, analysis of the physical evidence involves these steps: 1. Observe the UFO photo/video in a measurable, usually numeric way. As Lord Kelvin said, “If you cannot express it in numbers, your knowl- edge is of a weak and meager sort.” UFO position, size, brightness, color, or contrast, are all examples of numerically measurable characteris- tics. 2. Observe conventional objects in the same manner, if possible. Since atmospheric haze and lighting is often important, this should preferably be done with the same camera, lighting, direction, weather, etc. Such control experiments may seem difficult, but the photo/video itself often contains tree branches or hills that provide usable control objects. Or witnesses may be asked to perform control experiments with the equipment/ location/time of day in question. The reason for the request isn’t given or obvious, minimizing the chance the witness could fake the test. I’ve analyzed results of a witness video- taping himself throwing a basketball in the air (measuring camcorder exposure times), a yardstick video- taped at max zoom at 100 feet (measuring field of view), hinges hanging on strings (focus affecting the string’ detectability), or a brief- case on a dock (focus of the brief- case versus the opposite shore). A sincere witness will happily help the case despite these odd requests, being only interested in the truth; a faker, knowing the truth and faced with bewildering requests potentially exposing the fake, will usually give up on researchers and concentrate on publicity or profit. 3. Compare the UFO measurements with the conventional measurements to determine if the UFO measure- ments indicate an unconventional or impossible result. (Not all UFO measurements should be unconven- tional, as will be seen later!) 4. If the UFO’s characteristics are conventional or impossible, the case is probably “fooled.”Acommon example of an impossible result is an unseen object appearing on film. If the unseen object has extremely sharpfocus,betterthannearordis- tant objects, it cannot be a real object. Dirt from the developing solu- tion is the probable culprit; it will give averysharpshadowonfilm.Inthis case, the unseen object is usually extremely black, often the blackest part of the image. A real, distant object in daytime sky will have some haze or glare brightening its image; if none is seen, a UFO is impossible, and dirt is indicated. The 110 format film, with a small negative, is particu- larly troublesome for this problem. About 70% of my cases are “fooled;” about 50% are the planet Venus. Most Venus cases involve bad camcorder focus. The resultant image is not of Venus, but of the camera aperture, and often resem- bles the “Batman” searchlight. One UFO magazine showed cases of bad focus taken around the world, and MUFONhostsanonlinemessageboardwherephotoandvideoevidence senttoMUFONforanalysiscanbediscussedanddebatedbyphotoand videoexperts.Ifyouconsideryourselftobesuchanexpert,andwouldlike toparticipateinthisforum,pleaseemailyourqualificationsto jcarrion@mufon.com .Selectqualifiedanalystswillbeinvitedtoparticipate intheforum.

Of course, no controls were done. If they had, they would have reached the proper conclusion: Sony sells camcorders worldwide! The collage above shows the variety of shapes achieved when a point-source of light is out of focus, from a variety of camcorder models. The rightmost, asymmetrical images are achieved when a point-source is off-center. 5. If the characteristics are unconven- tional, are they better explained by a “fact” or “results public (subject to witness privacy) and wait months or years for other cases to corroborate or contradict the new evidence. The published results should include any observations that may appear to have no relevance to the conclusion. For instance, a lens flare may indicate the direction of the sun, although the sun angle has no apparent bearing on the case. Other researchers may use this apparently-irrelevant information to test their own theories. This last step is not limited to the “fact” cases. The psychology of “fooled” wit- nesses or the technology of “faked” cases, is useful, for example, for study of future cases. Non-Optical Guidelines Some non-optical, not-precisely- scientific guidelines are useful: 1. The higher the number of witnesses, the lower the chance the case is a fraud. “Three people can keep a secret if two of them are dead,” Poor Richard’s Almanac. Stories get mixed up, or somebody starts gig- gling, with too many fakers. The more witnesses the better the chance of recognizing an ordinary object, or of accurately determining the char- acteristics of an extraordinary object. Children, heard on videotape audio tracks, often make good witnesses, reporting “just the facts, ma’am” with little attempt to pigeonhole the sighting into some interpretation. Independent verification is a hall- mark of science, and although a visual sighting isn’t exactly an independent verification of what is recorded on film, it is corroborating or contradicting evidence. The most compelling cases are those where all the unobvious evidence contradicts the witness testimony, suggesting a fraud, or where the witness testi- mony appears to contradict the obvious evidence, but the unobvious evidence corroborates the witness. 2. Humans are imperfect witnesses, but the camera or camcorder has its own imperfections. When witnesses saw nothing, but an anomalous object appears on film or tape, equipment malfunction must be carefully checked. Fortunately, equipment imperfections are far better under- stood than human imperfections! 3. Photos are easy to fake, but videos are hard to fake. A 30-second video contains 1800 fields that need editing! The ordinary witness has no access to a production lab.

A Review of Historical Accounts By Warren P. Aston Continued on page 11 Warren Aston This is the third of three parts that explores the idea of extraterrestrials on earth. Aston deals not with “contactee” or “channeling” claims, nor “abduction” phenomena, but instead. examines the evidence that some extra-terrestrials may live among us in our communities, appearing human. This month’s segment considers the more credible evidence that ET is already here, humans living with extraterres- trials on their planets, and ET strategy. More credible cases British researcher Timothy Good has documented a number of other cases that can be summarized here. One involved a friend of his for over thirty years, “ Joelle .” Stumbling across a saucer landing in 1963, Joelle was accepted into a small group of people working with several extraterrestrials on scientific matters. She was present with them on a number of occasions at various locations including her London flat where she cooked meals for them and assisted them in various ways. The men were described as normal in appearance and, interestingly, confirmed that Adamski had indeed been aboard their ships, but they had fed him disinformation after he revealed sensitive information. 25 In 1946, Allan Edwards was admitted to an army hospital in Virginia prior to his discharge from the army. Here, and again six weeks later on a street, he encountered an unusual man in army uniform he believes was extrater- restrial due to his perfect features and ability to heal. The following year, while in a Seattle hospital, Edwards encoun- tered two hospital attendants who had the ability to read his thoughts, awaken- ing a desire in Edwards to also help others. He had a number of UFO sightings in various places in the years that followed and seems to have seen his encounters with these strangers in religious terms, as “angels.” 26 In 1957, Hubert Lewis ,asmall town newsagent in England angry over his lot in life, very unexpectedly encoun- tered what seemed to be a projected being, who rebuked his language and then reassured him concerning his deceased wife and sons. The following year the contacts resumed in a more concrete, physical, manner and Lewis met with another man and his female companion who drove him to London where they visited various sights and ate a meal. Tall, dark-complexioned and very healthy looking, the couple claimed to be from Venus. Lewis was told that “many are living among us, and one cannot tell the difference. Medical men could, however, so I understand.” 27 In either 1957 or 1959, Italian engineer Luciano Galli claimedtohave mettwomeninBolognawhoinvitedhim to go by car into the countryside where they boarded a craft. Within minutes they had left earth and arrived at a huge dirigible-shaped mothership in space. He was shown through the mothership before being returned three hours later. Galli claimed this visit was very similar to Adamski’s case, including the men’s claim that they were from Venus. This may discredit it in the eyes of many, but he insisted that it happened nonetheless. 28 The long-running, intriguing case of German-born Ludwig Pallman began with his 1964 encounter on a train in Indiawithanunusualmanwhom Pallman gradually accepted was indeed extraterrestrial. He also met the man’s sister but after leaving India he did not encounter them again for several years. While working in Peru he was taken aboard one of their ships and spent some time with them at a jungle base where they experimented with hybrid plants. His hosts claimed to have been visiting earth since 1946. Pallman also traveled in the craft with them to Columbia and back in search of new plants. Following a two year break in contact he encoun- tered them again in El Salvador in 1969. His present whereabouts is unknown. 29 One strange story from Brazil in 1977 investigated by Brazilian intelligence services involved a young woman with long blonde hair who dressed all in black and lived alone on a small island. First noticed by locals for her frequent large purchases of fish, she became linked to the spate of UFO sightings in the area because of strange lights seen near her cabin. The UFO sightings ended when she vanished. 30 This has some similarity with a case from Puerto Rico in the late 19 th century involving a strange lady with unusual powers. This case resulted in a Catholic site of pilgrimage remembered to this day. In both cases, of course, other more mundane explanations remain possible. 31 Author-researcher Timothy Good himself claims that he has encountered people he believes are extraterrestrials living among us on at least two occa- sions. During a restaurant stop on a long bus journey from Tucson to Los Angeles in 1963, Good observed a girl with unusual features who acknowledged his telepathic question asking if she was from another planet. Then, in 1967, Good transmitted a mental request from his New York City hotel l obby for any extraterrestrials in the area to meet him. About half an hour later a man responded in the precise way Good had specified and then confirmed a second silent identifying request. British reserve being what it is, Good did not pursue any conversation however and the man eventually left after giving him a “long, penetrating look.” 32 Others have made"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"11 MUFON UFO Journal July 2007 Extraterrestrials Living Among Us? Continued from page 10 Continued on page 18 the same experiment, sometimes claim- ing success. 33 Numerous other encounters over the years also hint at the ability of some extra-terrestrials to move freely among us undetected due to their similarity in appearance to humans. 34 Humans Living on Alien Planets Luciano Galli and Ludwig Pallman are two who claimed that they were takenonboardspaceships,andtraveled elsewhere on earth or to a mothership, but some experiencers claim to have been taken to the aliens’ home planets. In 1940, Udo Wartena declined an invitation to go with the two extraterres- trials he met, later commenting that he didn’t know why he had done so. He mentions a young man who had earlier vanished without trace in the area and wondered if he had perhaps also met these people and gone with them. This introduces a small subset of cases suggesting that on a few occasions at least, the reverse seems to have hap- pened—instead of aliens living among us, some humans may have been able to go and live with the aliens. In my opinion, the least credible of these was the claim by South African Elizabeth Klarer (1910-1994) that she had a romantic liaison with a handsome spaceman. She claimed that in 1956 she spent 4 months on his planet near Alpha Centauri where she gave birth to their son. Klarer offered little by way of evidence. 35 A young French woman, Rose C., in 1952 encountered a landed craft with three very tall extraterrestrials accompa- nied by a normal-looking man who acted as their translator. The man claimed to be a former teacher who had met these beings in 1932 and, without any family ties, had accepted their offer to live with them on their planet. Despite the passage of twenty years he had hardly aged. He asked her for some reading material which she provided before he and the “giants” re-entered their ship and flew away. 36 From the Caribbean comes the 1972 case of a motorist who was flagged down on a lonely road in the Dominican Republic by a well-known man, Freddie Miller , who was thought to have disappeared at sea fifteen years earlier. Miller claimed that he had been rescued from drowning by an alien craft and showed the driver a strange craft and two tall men standing some distance away. The conversation lasted only about five minutes before the man bid the driver farewell and departed with his alien colleagues. 37 Finally, a number of cases involving missing aircraft and pilots have left open the possibility that they may have voluntarily “gone” to join extraterrestri- als. In at least one case, a flight leader claimed exactly that, prior to finally disappearing without trace over the Atlantic in 1959. 38 Extraterrestrial strategy and our future Let us for a moment reverse the situation and consider what our strategy would be if, in years to come , we encountered a planet whose less- developed inhabitants were largely given to war and material pursuits. What wouldwedotoencouragethemtoward a fundamental change in their attitudes and a greater awareness of their environ- ment? Would we stand by and watch them export these dangerous tendencies beyond their planetary cradle as their science advanced? Our greatest interest would surely be to monitor their scien- tific and military progress. Surely our contacts with their people would be low- key, grass-roots style, intended to slowly acclimatize them to the fact of our presence without causing fear and disruption. I suspect that we would essentially quarantine them to their world and engage in efforts on multiple fronts to stimulate responsibility so that the behavioral changes necessary would be internalized by their society. Only then would they be ready to take their place and join us in the great adventure of interstellar and intergalactic travel. This process is exactly what I see unfolding in the UFO phenomenon. In my own lifetime I have seen ufology move from a focus on unknown lights flying in the sky, to an acceptance of landings and eventually, an acceptance that these craft can be piloted by beings who sometimes interact with us. Con- comitant with that understanding has come the awareness that “the aliens” are demonstrably not a single race, but are many, numbering perhaps in the dozens at least. The pervasiveness of the basic human form throughout the cosmos is clearly communicated in all of these cases, with all that this may imply about our own ultimate origins. I believe that a solid core of genuine human-extraterrestrial interaction exists in the plausible cases I have briefly presented here. If we combine this with the many thousands of reported encoun- ters with UFOs and their occupants worldwide over many years, we see a staggering level of alien activity, espe- cially when we consider the low per- centage of sightings and encounters that are actually reported. Increased awareness of these themes has come only gradually over the last four decades or so in the UFO community. Obviously the general public is much less aware of the evi- dence and is also greatly influenced by popular media portrayals of the subject. Ours is the responsibility to teach more and to teach better the facts as they have accumulated, even as we advance our own front-line toward the day when open disclosure of the alien presence on earth can becomes a reality. That will come, I believe, not when military-industrial power elites and governments are somehow forced to end the cover-up, but only when earth’s awareness of the need for peace and a change in our society’s funda- mental assumptions reaches a critical mass. Ultimately, disclosure is con- trolled by our visitors to earth. They"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"July 2007 12 MUFON UFO Journal March 8–Aug. 15 —Alien Images: UFOs, Photography and Belief.

Roesler The Smoking Gun Research Agency (SGRA) was counting on their long-standing working relationship with Mutual UFO Network to attract mem- bers to the group’s yearly ParaCon conference, held June 9–10 in Milford, Connecticut. The 9th Annual Paranormal Confer- ence, known as ParaCon, drew in excess of 300 attendees this year, an all-time high for the conference. The website of the sponsoring organization, The Smoking Gun Research Agency, drew an additional 250 visitors to its “Virtual ParaCon” section, ostensibly doubling the attendance figures. The theme of this year’s event was A Window to the Unexplained .This theme was chosen as being representa- tive of the goals of not only the SGRA as an organization, but also the research community as a whole. The group panel discussion, featuring the full slate of guest speakers and workshop presenters, showcased multiple fields of the group’s research, ranging from UFO research to govern- ment investigation. Workshops held at the event included a presentation on the impor- tance of paperwork when conducting field investigations, conducted by Jill O’Malley, as well as a presentation on the types of equipment used during field investigations, conducted by SGRA Director Jon Nowinski. Nowinski, as a consultant to MUFON in the field of Parapsychology, was a speaker at the 2003 MUFON International Symposium at Dearborn, Michigan. Since that time, the SGRA and MUFON have enjoyed what Nowinski terms “an open drawer relationship,” with regard to case investigations and case data. During its ten-year history, SGRA has amassed a large number of UFO case reports, many of them older cases that, for various reasons, may have gone unreported to other organiza- tions. In the spirit of cooperation, Nowinski opened the SGRA’s UFO files to MUFON, forwarding material on to MUFON headquarters for inclusion into MUFON’s Case Management System. Along the same line, SGRA has also received cases via direct assignment from MUFON, on a case by case basis. SGRA members and MUFON members from the northeastern states attended the 2007 SGRA ParaCon for presentations on not only UFOs, but all manner of paranormal phenomena. 2007 is the third year that MUFON has had a representative on the speaker panel. Wisconsin MUFON member Nick Roesler has spoken at the event since 2005, and Michigan’s David Twichell was a featured speaker in 2006.

Friedman and Kathleen Marden, Career Pr Inc., 320 pages. AvailableAugust 2007 Reviewed by John F. Schuessler Many books have been written about people being abducted by aliens, but Captured! tops them all. It is powerful, detailed and personal. Authors Kathleen Marden and Stanton Friedman are uniquely suited for the task of documenting the Betty and Barney Hill UFO experience. While this is not the first book written about the Hill case, it is the first one written drawing on first-hand knowledge of the incident and all of the events transpiring afterwards. Ms. Marden is Betty Hill’s niece and this relationship provided her with a unique view of thecasefrom within the family setting. Because she is now the trustee of the Hill UFO Archival Collection, she has been able to draw on new and never before released information from Betty’s personal diaries, tapes and writings. Nuclear physicist Stanton T. Friedman combines his detailed knowledge of the case, a long history of work in the UFO field, and his scientific background to assure the technical accuracy of the book. The Introduction by Ms. Marden relates her special connection to the Hills and how she became the most knowled- geable person in the world with respect to thecase.Asaresultshewasableto expose an abundance of inaccurate and misleading information written by others. She researched the complete medical records of Betty and Barney and gene- rated a chronological collection of infor- mation that spans a forty-year period. Chapter 1, A Glimpse into the Lives of Betty and Barney Hill, alone is worth the price of the book. It tells how they met, where they worked, what had happened in their lives before they met, and how they eventually married. This is a refreshing look at the real people involved in this frightening experience. While previous books related how thecasewasinvestigatedandhow hypnosis was used by Dr. Benjamin Simon, this book presents this information in a new context based on the details Ms. Marden obtained through her family connections with Betty and Barney and from the historical archives now preserved by Ms. Marden. Few people know of the close ties between the Hills and personnel at Pease Air Force Base. This background is freshly presented, along with copies of the official government records of the events occurring during the time of the Hill experience. New details of the incident itself show that a real event occurred and just how wrong some of the material presented by debunkers writing about the case has been. The debunkers’ prosaic explanations have been destroyed by the facts that have been uncovered and presented by Marden and Friedman. For the reader seeking technical information, the sections on the sessions with Dr. Benjamin Simon, the details of Betty’s meeting with the alien leader, the star map analysis, and the laboratory analysis of the dress worn by Betty during the incident, are a real treat. Attheendofthebookthereaderis given insightful information about Betty, her many talents, the things she deemed to be important and how her health declined leading up to the end. Also included is a bizarre occurrence that took placewhilethefamilywasawaiting Betty’s fate. I was made aware of the occurrence right after it happened and I am pleased it is included in the book. It leaves the reader with more food for thought. No single book could contain all of the archived information about the Hill case, but this book does an excellent job of presenting fresh details along with the basic story already known by many people. Highly recommended. Dark Cosmos: In Search of our Universe’s Miss- ing Mass and Energy By Dan Hooper, Smithsonian Books, Harper Collins, New York, 2006 Review by David Seals Dr. Dan Hooper is a Fellow with the theoretical astrophysics group at the Fermi NationalAccelerator Laboratory in Batavia, Illinois, whereheinvesti- gates dark matter, supersymmetry, neutrinos, extra dimensions and cosmic rays. Dark Cosmos is his first book, after studying at the University of Wisconsin and at Oxford. He’s mainstream, orthodox, establishment. He makes no comparisons himself of the “completely unknown” nature of the entire “empty space” of our Cosmos to UFOs, but I couldn’t help being fascinated with the possibility of the comparison. MostoftheUniverseisblack,after all. Physicists are finally admitting it. Fritz Zwicky, an astronomer at the Carnegie Institute, first suggested in 1933 that large amounts of dark matter might exist. This idea was ignored until Vera Rubin wrote her master’s thesis in 1950. Rubin’s measurements suggested that groups, or clusters, of galaxies might be rotating around a previously unrecog- nized central point within each cluster, not just expanding outward as was believed by the scientific community. To explain this motion, a huge quantity of mass would have to be present to keep the galaxies in their orbits. In fact, she found that the quantity of mass needed to explain the motion was greater than the total mass of the stars within the galaxies. The stars were simply not numerous enough to explain her observations, and she concluded that some sort of invisible matter must also be present.

Friedman Stanton Friedman Continued on page 15 I recently received an email from an 18-year-old student bemoaning the poor quality of the anti-UFO literature available to him at school. The article that bothered him the most was written in 2000 by Dr. Robert L. Park, Professor of Physics at the University of Maryland. I agreed that there was not enough pro- UFO literature available and decided to review the article. Dr. Park has been attacking many aspects of the so-called paranormal, but as might be expected, is not bothering to do his homework first, so sure was he of the correctness of his opinions. I had seen a very similar article in his book, Voodoo Science . The article is entitled “AnAlien Spaceship Did Not Crash in Roswell.” In common with other UFO debunkers and propagandists (sometimes there isn’t much difference), he makes sure he lets us know how smart he is compared to an average Joe. On the way to Roswell in 1954 as an Air Force officer he had two sightings which he easily identified. Park claims that Roswell at the time was the hub of many speculations about the UFO sightings that seemed to make the news almost daily. (I seriously doubt this). He then does some amateur psychology about people knowing what saucers are supposed to look like and shaping observations to fit their preconceptions. Park makes the extraordinary claim that “The current fascination with aliens can be traced back to the strange events that took place near Roswell, New Mexico, in the summer of 1947.” This is completely absurd as there was only one mention of Roswell (inaccurate and less than a page in Frank Edward’s Flying Saucers Serious Business between 1947 and the publication of The Roswell Incident in 1980. Aliens certainly weren’t mentioned in connection with Roswell until the 1980 publication. Park says, “On June 14, 1947, William Brazel, the foreman of the Foster Ranch, 75 miles northwest of Roswell, spotted a large area of wreckage about seven miles from the ranch house. The debris included neoprene strips, tape, metal foil, cardboard and sticks.” This is a commonly repeated lie about the event. It appeared in the front page July 9 article in the Roswell Daily Record titled “Harassed Rancher who Located ‘Saucer’ Sorry he Told About It.” By that time, Brazel had actually been brought back to town and fed a new, false, story. The article also includes the comment that the wreckage covered an area 200 yards in diameter. Park, of course, seems to be unaware of the fact that the July 8 articles on the front pages of evening papers from Chicago to points west noted that the wreckage was found “last week”—hardly June 14. Park says, “weeks later he [Brazel] heard about reports of flying saucers. The next day he drove to the little town of Corona to sell wool and while there he whispered kind of confidential like to the Lincoln County Sheriff, George Wilcox, that he might have found pieces of one of those flying discs people were talking about.” More slices of baloney. The rancher—who according to witness testimony, found the wreckage about July 2 or 3—went into Corona to do his usual Saturday shopping on July 5. While in Corona he heard about flying disks at the general store and also that rewards were being offered. Brazel hadn’t heard this before because he didn’t have electricity nor did he get a newspaper. The people there suggested he go to the sheriff’s office which is in Roswell (NOT in Corona) in Chavez County. He did so on Sunday, July 6. Sheriff Wilcox called the local base and talked to Major Jesse Marcel, who then came to the sheriff’s office and checked out the small amount of material Brazel had brought in. He found it was very unusual indeed and certainly not a weather balloon. The article notes that Brazel had previously found balloons and collected small rewards for them. Marcel was then instructed by Colonel William Blanchard, the base commander, to take a counter intelligence officer (S. Cavitt) with him and check out the large debris field observed by the rancher. Marcel and Cavitt followed Brazel out to the ranch (which was in the middle of nowhere—no GPS back then), had a can of beans, and stayed overnight in their sleeping bags. The next morning, Monday, they viewed the debris field and collected some more of the debris, leaving most of it behind, and then returned the long way to Roswell. Marcel stopped at his home and Roswell Critic Exposed"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"15 MUFON UFO Journal July 2007 Continued on page 20 showed some of the wreckage material to his wife and son (now a colonel, pilot, and medical doctor). The next morning, Colonel Blanchard, after reviewing the wreckage, ordered Marcel to have one of the B-29s fly him and the wreckage to Wright Patterson AFB with a stop at 8 th AF headquarters in Fort Worth. He also ordered Walter Haut to issue the infamous press release. Of course Blanchard and Marcel were quite familiar with weather balloons from their air service in the Pacific during WW 2. The 509 th at Roswell was, after all, the most elite military group in the world having exploded four atomic bombs. Marcel was also familiar with foil and paper radar reflectors from a course he had taken not very long before. Before he arrived in Ft. Worth, Colonel Thomas Jefferson Dubose (Chief of Staff to General Ramey, Blanchard’s boss), took a call from General Ramey’s boss in DC, General Clements McMullen, instructing Ramey to send the wreckage to DC with one of his colonel couriers, to get the press off their backs any way possible, and never to talk about it again. When Marcel arrived, General Ramey instructed him not to say anything. Pictures were taken with phony wreckage and the cover story went out from Ft. Worth, NOT Roswell, within hours. Dr. Park seems blissfully unaware. How do I know my version is more accurate? Because I got it first hand from Major Marcel, from his son Dr. Jesse Marcel Jr., from retired General DuBose, from Brazel’s son, from Brazel’s neighbors, and from contemporary news coverage. Here is another silly quote from Park, “The sheriff reported the matter to the nearby base. The army sent intelligence officer Major Jesse Marcel to check out the report. Marcel thought the debris looked like pieces of a weather balloon or radar reflector, in any event all of it fit easily in to the trunk of his car.” More silly nonsense. Marcel had stayed overnight on the ranch, had observed a debris field more than half a mile long and hundreds of yardsacross.Henotedtomeinour first conversation and said later on camera that there was nothing conventional: no wires, or vacuum tubes or rivets or propellers etc. His son also noted there was nothing conventional. There were I-beams that couldn’t be broken, burned or bent, that had strange symbols, and foil like material that was a memory metal. He furthermore made clear that while he and Cavitt brought back what they could in their cars, most of the debris was left out there. If a trunk load had been all there was, the rancher would have brought it in and there would have been no need for a trip to the ranch. Park goes on. “By 1978, thirty years after Brazel spotted wreckage on his ranch, actual alien bodies had begun to show up in accounts of the crash.” Really? I wonder where these accounts appeared. I first heard stories about bodies at the Barney Barnett crash site in 1978. The first mention of Roswell-related bodies came from Mortician Glenn Dennis to me in 1989 in Lincoln, NM, on Billy the Kidd day. Park says, “Major Marcel’s story about loading sticks, cardboard and metal foil into the trunk of his car mutated into the saga of a major military operation which allegedly recovered an entire alien spaceship.” What was found was all small strange pieces—hardly a spaceship. Most of it was left behind. Under the heading “A Full Scale Myth” Park says: “Like a giant vacuum cleaner the story had sucked in and mingled together snippets from reports of unrelated plane crashes (where with whom??) and high altitude parachute experiment involving anthropomorphic dummies, even though some of these events took places years later and miles away. And with years’ worth of imaginative energy to drive their basic beliefs, various UFO “investigators” managedtostitchthosemythsintoa full scale myth of an encounter that has been covered up by the government.” Does Park have any idea of the stupidity of what he is saying? It was USAF Colonel Weaver and Captain MacAndrew in the two ridiculous volumes of The Roswell Report who introduced the crazy notion of crash test dummies to explain the bodies— even though none of the dummies were dropped until 1953 and later, and were 6’ tall, much taller than the reported alien bodies. It was the USAF that introduced high altitude parachute jumper/pilot Joseph Kittinger as the redhead reported at the base in July 1947—but who wasn’t actually there until 1959.The UFO investigators in question were two Air Force officers lying through their teeth. Park then buys hook, line, and sinker into the Mogul Balloon explanation as espoused by Colonel Weaver in The Roswell Report: Fact vs. Fiction in the New Mexico Desert (1995). He claims Mogul was still classified. This is false. He touts Dr. Charles Moore’s Flight 4 although Dr. David Rudiak’s careful work indicates it wasn’t even flown and couldn’t have made it to the ranch, because of the weather. Park says “The debris found on the Foster Ranch closely matched the materials used in the balloon trains.” Yet another lie, as long as one notes the reports from such witnesses as Major Marcel, his son, Brazel’s son, neighbor Loretta Proctor, etc. There was, of course, also the absence of any string (20+ balloons were tied 20 feet apart by Friedman: Roswell Critic Exposed Continued from page 14"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"July 2007 16 MUFON UFO Journal P P h y s i c a l T r a c e s By Ted Phillips Sightingsin Marley Woods, Missouri Continued on page 17 Update: In the last column I described events at a Missouri site involving video and multiple witness sightings of April 9th, 16th and May 20 th of this year. Since that time multiple observations of similar objects have been reported and video has been obtained. The latest sighting took place on June 5, 2007. The witnesses informed me that there is about 45 minutes of additional video following the April 16th sighting. I will be working those tapes this date, June 13. Updates of their content and witness descrip- tions will be presented as compiled. This month’s column discusses sightings at another Missouri location, Marley Woods. As I have mentioned in this column before, investigations continue at the MarleyWoods site in Missouri. Considering the wishes of the many witnesses the names and locations are all on file but cannot be released. The three primary sites have produced large numbers of close encounters, types 1 and 2 (CE1, CE2), since December of 1998. I was invited by the people involved to investigate the sightings and continue to do so. With the formation of the SIU we are currently conducting research as a team. In the next few columns, I will present detailed information about the most significant Marley events along with updates on any new data from other sites. December 15, 1998 MarleyWoods, Missouri: Extended aerial CE1 event. This was the first major sighting reported in the Marley research. The owners of Site 1, a 400-acre cattle ranch, were driving their truck to the ranch along a farm road at 1900 hours. They described the event as follows: “My wife and I were driving to our farm to check the cattle. We were on County Road __, right before the Terry __ home. I viewed a large lit stationary object above a high hill behind the __ house. I quickly alerted my wife, causing her to see it also. “I drove approximately another 100 yards, just past the — home, and stopped. I got out of the truck and the object immediately disappeared. “The best way of describing the object is that it was tank-like in form with at least three orange-colored lights about midway. These lights were running horizontally across the side of the object. It is possible that other smaller lights were above and below the larger lights. “The object produced no sound and then suddenly vanished.Also, no movement was detected as it ‘hovered’ above the tree line on the hill.” The witnesses added further description: “Three distinct orange lights across mid section, no blinking, not overly bright, just distinctly orange. Box ortankshaped.Nomovement,no sound, hovering. Numerous small lights clustered around three orange lights (no visible colors noted). Small lights were white. Top and bottom of object maybe a little more rounded (see witness sketch). Color of body not visible.” The object was less than 200 feet from the __ house, hovering over a tree-covered hill across the creek from the house. The __ family reported that just after 1900 they were alerted by the farm dogs barking, ran outside to see the farm animals running in panic down the hill (where the object had hovered), across the creek toward the house. The dogs were reacting with panic also (these are very large guard dogs). The family did not see an object that night but did on subsequent evenings. “We continued our drive to the gate of the farm (about 1,500 feet) and as we sat in the truck my wife yelled, ‘there it is again.’ “The object was again stationary and hovering without sound or move- ment in front of and above our cabin (site 1). [The object was hovering in the area of the cabin which is located 700 feet from the gate.] When we began driving toward the object it again vanished. “We drove to my barn to get feed and again saw the large object hovering above the far northeast timber horizon. The object appeared to be very large,"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"17 MUFON UFO Journal July 2007 Missouri Sightings Continued from page 16 tank-like in shape and with the same orange lights around its mid section. It also appeared to be moving very slowly eastward until it suddenly vanished. “Shortly after it disappeared, two large orange lights came into view to the right of where the object had previously been. These two lights grew larger in dimension and then disap- peared with no sound. “After seeing this, my wife called our son and daughter who then came to the farm also. “Nothing was seen for the next forty-five minutes. While I was in the cabin I heard them call for me. When I arrived at the car where they were sitting, they told me what they had seen. “While gazing eastward, they all three saw a ghostly glowing light coming up the hill from the creek in the direction of where they were sitting. They equated the glow to that of vehicular headlights coming up from the creek, however, neither beam nor source of light was seen—only its glow. In essence, the glow appeared as vehicle headlights which had not topped the hill, yet the glow of approaching headlights was seen preceding headlights.” On my first visit on 1/16/99 we checked the area where the glow was observed. There is a rough and very small lane used to drive to the cattle going down the hill into an extremely rugged area. There is no access to this area by vehicles without passing by the cabin where the witnesses were located. Based on their description the glow was within 150 feet of the witnesses at the close point. The small lane cannot be reached from the opposite direction because of locked gates and lack of any access. Nothing exists in the area to generate a glow or light. TP “About thirty minutes later, I and the other three saw the same beam or glow moving east across the open field from which they had originally seen the light. It appeared as a faint spotlight searching the field, but the light had no bright source. Also, there were no vehicles in the vicinity and no sound was heard.” It should be noted the area is isolated and extremely quiet; the slightest sound would be easily heard. TP “At approximately 2045, while driving home, we again approached the Terry __ home. Illuminated by his porch light, Terry stood in his yard with rifle in hand. We stopped and Terry told us that his dogs had been barking so he came out to see what had riled them up. His goats, sheep, and large guard dogs who usually spent the night on the high hill where we had first viewed the hovering object had come off the hill and were gathered around Terry’s house. According to Terry, the animals were very restless.” December 16, 1998 The cabin owner describes the events: “The next evening at 1845 I arrived at the entrance gate to my farm. I shut off the engine and as I began to exit the vehicle to unlock the gate I saw a bright light appear above the northeast horizon. As I watched, six more lights appeared in a horizontal line to make a total of seven lights. After several seconds they began to “squeeze” out. I immediately phoned my son and he came to the farm. “After my son and I sat about twenty minutes watching the northeast, we saw a large bright orange light appear. The field beneath the object seemed to have a faint spotlight glow moving around the field.About fifteen seconds later, a second orange light appeared, and as we both watched, a small silver object seemed to exit the orange object and began moving southeast. We both watched the silver object as it flew out of sight. Over the next forty-five minutes, three orange lights appeared. Both December 15 and 16 were very clear with no moon.” December 17, 1998 Eight witnesses observed “a small bright light moving from south to northeast at high speed. It suddenly made an immediate hairpin U-turn and began traveling south.About five seconds after the sharp turn, a large orange glow appeared where the smaller light was located. When the orange glow was brightest, a very small object moved out of the orange glow and traveled out of sight toward the south. During the next thirty to forty minutes, a total of sixteen orange lights were observed. Ten lights in a continual succession were seen lighting up in a perfect horizontal line across the northeastern sky. These lights were followed a few minutes later by three lights in a “spaced apart,” somewhat vertical arrangement. Nathan __ videotaped some of the ten lights. As he attempted to tape the smaller object, the camera ceased functioning, however it did function when turned away from the object. Thus the many sightings started in the Site 1 area. It should be noted that the property owners had not been interested in UFO sightings and wanted no publicity. They were at the farm tending the large cattle herd each evening for years before the initial event of December 15, 1998 and had not observed anything unusual prior to that date. Three nights after the December 17th sighting, a neighbor and two of his friends would experience a truly remar- kable event just 2,000 feet southeast of Site 1.

Aston: Extraterrestrials Among Us Continued from page 11 When Ms. Rubin first presented her results in 1950 to the American Astronomi- cal Society, her conclusions were not taken seriously despite her experimental evidence. In 1970, Rubin (along with W. Kent Ford) published a paper in the Astrophysi- cal Journal . It described her detailed observations of the motions of stars in the Andromeda Galaxy, and demonstrated that for the stars to be moving with the velocities they had, there would have to be as much as ten times more mass in the galaxy than was visible. “To put it another way, roughly 90 percent of the Andromeda Galaxy consists of dark matter. Over the next years, those results were confirmed by other groups of astronomers. By the 1980s, much of the astrophysics community had come to accept the conclusions of Rubin’s work. Richard Panek (author of The Invis- ible Century: Einstein, Freud, and the Search for Hidden Universes ) wrote about this in the New York Times Magazine ( March 11, 2007), saying: “Only 4 percent of the universe is made of the kind of matter that makes up you and me and all the planets and stars and galaxies. The rest–96 percent–is... who knows?...This is not ‘dark’ as in distant or invisible. This is ‘dark’ as in unknown for now, and possibly forever.” It reminds me of the take Captain Edward J. Ruppelt had in his great 1956 book The Report on Unidentified Flying Objects , in which the director of the USAF Project Blue Book wrote, “In the summer of 1952 a United StatesAir Force F-86 jet interceptor shot at a flying saucer... the pilot did see something and he did shoot at something, but no matter how thor- oughly you investigate the incident that something can never be positively identified. It might have been a hallucina- tion or it might have been some vehicle from outer space.... It was a UFO.” Or take GeorgeAdamski, describing a conversation he had with an inhabitant of aUFO( Inside the Spaceships , 1955) who said,“Speedtousdoesnotmeanwhatit does to you. For once a ship is launched into outer space, the speed of the ship is equal to the activity in space! Instead of being artificially propelled, as are your planes, ours travel on the currents of space.” Is this any crazier than Hooper’s theory that “Dark matter halos are significantly larger than the visible part of most galaxies, and often extend well into intergalactic space?” Or Professor Stephen Hawking’s statements that there is a “finite infinity?” Dr. Hooper summarizes, cosmologists call the energy contained in ‘empty’ space dark energy . “Assuming that dark energy exists in the same quantity in every piece of space and at all times, its presence would have precisely the effect of a cosmological constant. Dark energy does not act at all like the ordinary energy or matter in our Universe, however. Whereas ordinary energy or matter causes the Universe to be pulled together by the force of gravity, the presence of dark energy has a sort of counter-gravity effect.” Dan Hooper actually makes this science coherent and understandable to a guy like me who flunked 9th grade algebra.

Excerpts from the TV report follow: News Anchor: “It is the first time that something similar to this is regis- tered in our country. People living in Lima are surprised due to strange sightings in the sky.” Male reporter Francisco Landauro (voice): “Dozens of “Limenos” were left more than surprised by what their eyes observed over our sky.” Witness #1: “There are more than 20 flying saucers, friend, over there! Look over there! (Pointing) This is happening right now and everybody is just walking.” Witness #2: “No, I don’t know. I don’t believe in the flying saucers but, it looks like it.” Reporter Landauro: “This strange and surprising spectacle, registered in Lima two days ago, was captured by a team of ATV News. For more than 30 minutes, a diversity of white points were observed that were forming shapes in the sky.” Peruvian Air Force Commander Julio Chamorro: “This comes to be a very interesting subject, however, it continues to be an anomalous aerial phenomenon because it is not con- trolled and we [do not] have a techni- cal... appropriate, coherent explanation to say what it is.” Reporter Landauro: “The com- mander of the Peruvian Air Force, Julio Chamorro, was cautious in assuring [this as] possible extraterres- trials, but he did provide video of this same phenomenon recorded in 1994 and 1995 over multiple Mexican cities.” Commander Julio Chamorro: “It needs to be controlled, it needs to be known what this is about. It even could be, although this has never happened, that this would jeopardize aerial operations in general.” Francisco Landauro: “These sightings could, in fact, be studied by an office [group] that deals with aerospace systems, as they do exist in countries like Chile, Brazil,Argentina, and Mexico.” Pennsylvania Disc Illustration by Witness BREEZEWOOD —I was sitting outside watching the clouds roll in on May 27, 2007. The clouds were still just a light haze, and the stars were dimly shining through, when a bright light appeared almost directly above me at 11:30 PM. The light grew brighter and brighter until it became almost as bright as the moon. As it dimmed out, it began to move slowly to the Northwest, passing one of the stars that I could still see through the haze. Twenty minutes later, Peruvian UFO Fleet covered on television;Astronaut saw UFO at 11:50 PM another green light appeared heading north.

Park then talks about Vol. 2 Case Closed as a massive report that collected every scrap of information dealing with the Roswell Incident report published in 1997. It’s funny that Vol 2 was much smaller than Vol. 1 which covered the Mogul explanation and which was published in 1995. Park then buys into the CIA lies about many UFO reports in the 1950s being the result of observations of super secret U-2 aircraft and later the SR-71. The CIA was glad to deceive all by accepting those reports. Of course Park provides no backup for this baseless claim which Dr. Bruce Maccabee has demonstrated was clearly false. The number of UFO sightings did NOT increase when they started flying. Park’s last line is more true than he would like to know: “Concealment is the soil in which pseudoscience flourishes.” I fully agree that organized anti-ufology is indeed a pseudoscience concealing and ignoring facts and data and doing its research by proclamation. His motto is “Don’t bother me with the facts, my mind is made up.” It is of interest that Park doesn’t reference my book Crash at Corona: the Definitive Study of the Roswell Incide nt (with Don Berliner), though I am a member of the Ameri- can Physical Society with which he had been closely associated. He doesn’t mention Weaver’s report or the Randle and Schmitt books. Of course he mentions the debunker books by Klass, Korff, Schaefer, Peebles. This indeed is pseudoscience.

Colorado Dark Triangle DENVER —Our family was walking the dog in the middle of Washington Park on Saturday evening, May 26, 2007 around 9:30 PM. Our eleven- year-old son pointed and asked, “What’s that?” There were event search lights flashing on the clouds at the time. At first we thought he was asking about the lights but all four family members quickly spotted a dark triangular or boomerang shape moving slowly across the background of light and clouds that were part of a storm front. The dark shape was clearly moving independently of the cloud movement. The shape was never illuminated by the search lights and had no lights of its own. It also did not appear to reflect light. It was evident primarily due to the absence of light, like a shadow. It was distinct when the cloud backdrop was solid and very hard to see when it crossed a darker or broken patch in the clouds. The shape moved slowly to the southeast, and then reversed direction back toward the northwest without turning. It became faint and then disappeared in a larger area of dark sky. We watched it for 3 to 4 minutes. MUFON CMS report. FOUNTAIN —On May 31, at 12:45 PM. I was at Fountain Creek Nature Center near my home doing yoga on a platform out in the wetlands...when I noticed swirling energy (not clouds) above me. I was relaxing, doing meditation, while lying flat on my back looking up into the sky. I was observ- ing the interesting energy swirls. They are difficult to describe. I’d never seen anything like it before...but there was an obvious energy disturbance taking place directly above me in the sky. Then a small white cloud sud- denly appeared about the size of a softball. An even smaller piece of this small white cloud separated from the main cloud. The main cloud quickly disappeared...leaving this peculiar little white triangular cloud in the middle of the blue sky. Then this little cloud, the size of a big marble started spreading out...and behind it I saw, a cylindrical shaped matte metal object. It looked about the size of half a ballpoint pen... and was rounded on both ends. Its cloud cover totally disappeared leaving a non-shiny silver grey object...it was only visible for approximately 15 seconds or so...but I saw it clearly. Thanks to Elise Eagle and MUFON CMS.

Other Celestial Phenomena: Perseids Meteor Shower : Date : Aug 10-15 (peaking on Aug 13 th ) Rate : 66/hour August is a great time of the year to look at the sky after midnight. It is usually still warm after the heat of the day, and skies can be surprisingly clear. It’s just as well then that the year’s best meteor shower, called the Perseids, always occurs during this month. The Perseid Meteor shower occurs when the Earth passes though the orbit of comet Swift-Tuttle, a comet discovered back in 1862 and returns to the inner solar system ever 128 years; its last visit was in 1992.
