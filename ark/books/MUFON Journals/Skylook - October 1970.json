She got up to take a - look. Just as she got up, Mrs. Thompson said she hesrd a strange noise like a \"popf1 which later reminded her of a cor,k coming out of a bottle, She said it was a hollow sound and sounded like it could have been som5 distance aw?y. She follov~ed the sound and rushed to look out the ba'ck door of the trailer which faces east. Just as she'opened the door, ,she sam an in- tense light shining through a nearby tree which j?.l.?mi?~?ed the inside of her trailer. She a!:o saw something behicd. th~ r,ree, In just a moment, Mrs. Thompson recountc<. th? ~li:sc!, moved from bg- hing the tree. It was large and cornplete~p r>o1l:x, s;;c saj d, a:ld eithe~ looked like a ball of fire or an in~ensely iliimiLv:ed object zicrne 10 to 20 times as bright as the moon. She also saw something hanklng from the objcct in the sky which looked like a long piece of rope, pos- sibly with another small object at the en(;, She said the object was low in the sky, perhaps the altitude of 3 small plane, but made-no noise It seemed to Mrs. Thompson to be less than an eighvlof a mile away and she added, llItm accustomed to pl~nes because I was in the WAVES.ll At this point, Mrs. Thompson said she csllsd Cook from the li-ving room and he, too, saw the object. As they wztched the object it moved north across the sky at a moderate rate of speed and then suddenly iis- appeared, according to Mrs. Thompsonts account. She h2d seen it for about a minute. \" It seemed to be a UFO,ll she said today. \"We were in a big hurry and it wzs terribly exciting but, believe you me, we saw i-t.\" Mrs. Thompson said she hed he~rd chout unidentified flving ob.jects before, but had never m~de any kind of sighting. We donft go around seeing things,ll she said. A spokesman for the U. S. Wezth~r Bureau could offer no explanation or evidence thzt anyone else saw.the object lzst night, but noted that the skies are-full of visible satellites.

By M~rk-Herbstrett . -- .--- Editor's Note: M~rk has sent in some additional notes and poi,?%~ out the ability to recognize the brighter stars and planets is of great value to the ufo10,gist and for obvious reasons. The Constellation Cygnus is prominent in the northwestern sky all during October. Cygnus is called the Swan or Northern Cross. The bright- est object in the constellation is the star,Deneb. It is ~agnitude 1.26 and is a 6lue supergiant star located at a distance of 1600 llpht, yeprs. De-neb is the 19th briphtest star in the sky. The dvl~ble star Albireo (Beta Cygni) is a beautiful si~ht in.a 6-inch telescope. This double consists of a golden yel,low star of 3rd maqnltude ar.d a blue -companion of' 5th magnitude a;t' a d'istance of 410 light years. -The .dou5le star . 61 :Cygni is about '11 'light years away. The distance to 61 Cygni was measured by Bessel in 1838. 61 Cygni has an unseen companion eight times .the size of Jupiter. The companion his either a -small star' or a 3. large planet. The six bri-ghtest stars in Cygni are from first to f0uT?.5 magnitudes. , D'eep sky objects in Cygnus: M-29--This is .a galactic star cluster' of t'he 7th magnitude located in a heavily obscured regi-on of the Milk; Way. It is 7200 -Light 'years distant and 15 light years in diameter., .. M-39--Th'is galactic cluster is located 8 degrees -ENE of Deneb -and.-cori- tahs about 30 stars,. It is 800 light years distant.' NCC 6960 and * NGC 6992--The Veil Nebula is one of the most striking,ob-jects in the heavens. 1.t was discovered by William Herschel inl 4784. It is -1 500' light years distant and is probably the reinnants of -a Supernova.. N6C 7000--the Nor'th America Nebula is a vast cloud of gases, dust and sears three degrees east of Denev. This nebula is estim~ted to be 1.600 light pears distant and 45 li-ght years in diameter. - . -- - -- , 'Observing these' objects on a clear night fihroughr a- &-inch telestope or greater helps the amateur astronomer appreciate the grandeur and*- vastness, of the universe. The -objects mentioned are in ouryown Mi2ky Way galaxy and there ire millions of galzxies and billions of-starsi in each.

The ship r;ioved 6ff, and other operators in the direction of the flight were warncd of its approach, arid ~hus town after town was prepred to gaze at it when it-came in sight, It is described by reputable citizens, who saw it, as hsving a: large reflecting headlight probably. two feet in diameterwhicn sheds' strong .rays like that 'of a locomotive heactlight, and to 'some extent prevented a good view of the body of the apparatus by its glare. How- ever the glistening body of the ship could be discerned and the dim ,. wing-like projections on either side, as descrsbed by 'previous obser- vws. The strange aerial craft moved swiftly through the air, mak5ng a slight hissing sound. .: At times it seemed to be within 1,000 fr-et of the earth and at times seemed to pause in its flight as,though its occ.upants.were taking ob- , . serkat'ions of the earth below. , , - No sound save the low hissing noise, which was only apparent when, the machine was in swift motion, came to the wondering observers and--- ifl:there were people in the craft their-ccnversation was-carried on in low tones or else the distance was too high above the earth for -the , . ground to carry. . , The strange object was in view generally from twenty minutes to half an hour and usually 'disappeared in a wcstcrly direction. At least a hundred trustworthy people declare they saw the air-ship but none of them are willing'to swear they wcre not dreaming, so stranze and unreal does its appearance seem to them. - - - ( Continued Next Nonth)"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"...
