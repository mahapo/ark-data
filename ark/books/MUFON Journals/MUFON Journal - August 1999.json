This 30 th annual MUFON UFO symposium was hosted by the Northern Virginia MUFON and expertly coor- dinated by Susan L. Swiatek. The major feature of any symposium is the lineup of speakers, since they not only provide the focus for most of the formal proceedings, but also informally interact with with symposium participants. This year's lineup was a nice mixture of those who have been outstanding in the field for many years, such as Richard Hall and Jenny Randies, and those who are relative newcomers, such as Kelly Cahill and Eve Frances Lorgen. Following are capsule summaries of some of the information provided by the speakers. The actual, in- depth presentations are included in the MUFON 1999 International UFO Symposium Proceedings, available from MUFON Headquarters, (see page 22). Richard Hall Hall, who has been a leader in such organizations as the National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phe- nomena (NICAP), MUFON, and the Fund for UFO Research (FUFOR), provided an interesting historical background on ufology's past fifty years. Among the topics covered in his talk were the \"sci- entific UFO underground,\" which J. Allen Hynek called \"the invisible college,\" referring to the numerous scientists and scholars at major institutions who take UFOs seriously. He lamented the fact, however, that \"the major institutions of our society have failed us so badly,\" noting that \"the UFO pill is too indigestible\" for major institutions to swallow. He suggests that ufologists must do a better job of gathering and study- ing UFO data, policing our own ranks, enlisting the services of our best scientists and thinkers to analyze data, and revising \"our theories—our world view—as necessary.\" Eve Frances Lorgen In a less traditional approach to ufology, Eve Frances Lorgen, who facilitates a research group for. UFO \\ Richard Hall Eve Lorgen abductees in California, discussed the proposition that aliens are actually manipulating human relationships. As she noted in an article in the January, 1999, MUFON UFO Journal, her 15 years of abduction re- search has convinced her that aliens sometimes orchestrate love matches, causing indi- viduals to be attracted to each other, \"often in unlikely cir- cumstances.\" Co-author with Barbara Bartholic of the recently-re- leased book The Love Bite, Ms. Lorgen suggests that, for whatever reasons, aliens \"are creating emotional and sexual bonding which often results in dramatic love obsessions in one or both partners.\" Beverly Trout A slightly different look at interaction between aliens and abductees was presented by MUFON State Director for Iowa Beverly Trout, herself an abductee. Ms. Trout suggested that both aliens and abductees have the capacity to make mistakes, and she acknowl- edged that the relationship between the two is \"ex- tremely unbalanced\" in favor of the aliens. However, she emphasized that it would be a mistake to deify the aliens, simply because they are more technologically powerful. Her experiences as an abductee and in working with other abductees has convinced her that \"the aliens do have an agenda,\" although she admits that she does not know what it is. Beverly Trout She says the aliens, \"first and foremost,\" are manipulative. She does not regard them as \"space (or dimensional) brothers\" or \"devils,\" nor does she feel they are spiritually superior. Betty Ann Andreasson Luca A third view of aliens-or at least some of them- was offered by Betty Ann Andreasson Luca, the sub- ject of five books by Raymond Fowler. While Mrs. Luca's individual experiences with aliens have not always been pleasant, her overall experience as an"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Page 4 August 1999 MUFON UFO Journal abductee has been positive. Her husband. Bob, and daughter, Becky, who apparently are also abductees, agree with this assessment. As a person with very strong fundamental religious beliefs, Mrs. Luca feels her experiences with the aliens have enhanced these beliefs, that contact with the aliens is much more than \"just nuts and bolts,\" and that faith is an important ingredient in alien-human interactions. She told of her experi- ences with the elders, who are tall, look human, are neither male nor female, have white hair, have white skin (like albinos) and wear robes. Possibly, says Mrs. Luca, they are Sons of God, like Melkezekek in the Old Testament. They seem to be Betty Andreasson Luca in charge, and apparently create the grays as their workers. She also discussed her experiences with the grays- the \"watchers\"-noting \"unusual similarities and dif- ferences between us.\" She said that the watchers are hybrids with spirit and body, but no soul, and thus no emotions. It is\"her understanding that \"all life con- nects,\" and that \"without the human race they would also cease, to exist.\" Kelly Cahill Kelly Cahill, of Victoria, Australia, told Sympo- sium attendees about her encounter with a UFO in 1993, which is one of the best documented cases on record. Ms. Cahill was riding in an auto with her husband when they saw a brightly-lighted UFO. They stopped their car, as .did the drivers of two other vehicles. All observers reported \"missing time,\" and Ms. Cahill reported that \"at least four of the encounter participants, including myself, were left with physical marks on some areas of their body,\" add- Kelly Cahill ing, \"all women participants were left with small tri- angular marks beneath the navel. The two women in the second party and the male from the third party displayed a series of marks on the inner thigh, whilst Glenda (party 2) and David (party 3) were able to present the most prominent markings, which appeared as quite severe marks around their left ankles.\" Sketches by Ms. Cahill and by the two women in the second vehicle were quite similar, and the investigation by Phenomena Research Australia in conjunction with independent analysts/laboratories and the Monash Uni- versity of Melbourne found significant ground traces. She indicated in her talk, as well as in a noon lun- cheon session, that she feels that those investigating the incident have unfairly withheld information from her, \"and who has a better right to it?\" Based on the infor- mation she does have, she has written an account of her experience, Encounter, published in 1996 by Harper- Collins. Dr. Thomas Eddie Dullard A statistical review of abductions was presented by Dr. Thomas Eddie Bullard, who compiled the massive comparative analysis of abduction reports titled UFO Abduction: The Measure of a Mystery, based on a study financed by the Fund for UFO Research (FUFOR), pub- lished in 1987. In discuss- ing \"What's New in UFO Abductions? Has the Story Changed in 30 years?,\" Bullard looked at 437 abduc- tion reports. He explained that the re- ports have indeed changed, with the types of aliens now more diversified, the divi- sion between aliens and hu- mans less distinct, more em- phasis on hybrids, repeat ab- ductions the norm, intima- tions of government involve- ment reported, new content details traced to well-publi- cized abduction accounts, and more \"spiritualization\" in today's accounts. However, a study of the data indicates that abduction accounts have not followed popular culture, said Bullard. \"The headline story behind these tallies is not that a few instances of cultural influence turn up,\" he noted, \"but rather that the changes are so few and so mild. Sweep- ing alterations such as cultural theorists proclaim are simply nowhere to be found.\" He added, however, that while \"proponents may take comfort in a consistency that appears to vindicate a lit- eral abduction phenomenon,\" they \"must reckon with the fact that a mere story, however consistent, is no sub- stitute for convincing physical evidence, a commodity still in notorious short supply.\" Budd Hopkins Veteran abduction researcher and author Budd Hopkins told attendees about one of his early cases in which his lack of experience with abductions at that time Dr. Bullard"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal August 1999 PageS Budd Hopkins actually interfered with his investigation, since he found it difficult to believe the story the witness was telling him, noting that other inves- tigators were having the same difficulty. This case, which had occurred in 1961 and was investigated by Hopkins in 1981, involved the apparent levitation and movement of an auto and its driver 100 miles. The driver, a military of- ficer on his way to report to a new base, had no con- scious memory of what hap- pened between the time his car was levitated and the next morning when he found himself and his car at a motel across the street from his new base. Under hyp- nosis he recalled undergoing an abduction experience, complete with physical examination. Hopkins concluded, \"This case contained aspects that clearly deserved to be followed up, and data that should have been published for the information and possible use of other researchers. Neither was done. Like most of us in this bizarre field, I circled the intel- lectual wagons tightly around myself and chose to pub- lish in Missing Time the more conservative and 'plau- sible' cases - to which I added only respectably parsi- monious theories and speculations.\" Jenny Randies Veteran British researcher Jenny Randies discussed a dozen points related to ufology today, both here and the UK, relating these to the Symposium theme of \"comfort zones.\" She noted that Identified Flying Objects (IFOs) \"are not fail- ures, but success stories,\" par- tially because they represent an achievable goal and such in- vestigations benefit society. Ms. Randies emphasized that \"there is not AN answer to the UFO phenomenon, but ANSWERS to the UFO phe- nomena. The quest for 'truth' is misleading to all sides until we recognize there are mul- tiple phenomena which may be linked by social factors and not by actual connections. Thus a search for a unified field of ufology can actually be counter productive.\" She suggested that the physical reality of UFOs may, in fact, involve unidentified atmospheric phenomena (UAP), suggesting that \"there are several types of UAP, involving electrical fields, rotating energies, or atmo- Jenny Randies spheric plasmas. These are phenomena on the fringes of knowledge, and some will create a new science when properly understood.\" Ms. Randies further suggested that UAPs may be connected with so-called \"window areas,\" locations which over a period of time have had an unusual number of unusual phenomena reported. She also discussed the often indistinct line between abductions and near death experiences (NDEs), not- ing, \"I have investigated a half a dozen cases in the UK where it is almost impossible to make a choice between whether the witness is describing an NDE or an abduction.\" Ms. Randies said that \"investigator selectivity- accepting or denying cases for consideration-is something we all engage in to some degree because we each have our own philosophy in the search for an answer. I do not think it is wrong to specialize, nor to utilize some discrimination as to which cases we embrace, but I do think more care is needed not to EXCLUDE events that at the very least appear instructive.\" Dr. S. Peter Resta Dr. S. Peter Resta, adjunct professor of psychology at Prince George's Community College and a practic- ing psychotherapist since 1985, explained to attendees why mainstream mental health professionals are often skeptical or critical of abductees and ufologists. One problem, he noted, pertains to increasing belief among professionals that what were once considered \"repressed memories,\" such as of childhood sexual abuse, are actually False Memory Syndrome (FMS), thus calling into question information about UFO en- counters accessed through hypnosis. Some of the profes- sional literature, such as the college text Social Psychol- ogy, actually cites the following in discussing FMS: \"... sometimes the memories are so bizarre (e.g., that people were abducted by aliens) as to strain credu- lity.\" There is also the view among many professionals, said Dr. Resta, that accounts of rape, the taking of eggs and sperm, and attractive aliens are the result of sexual fantasies or sexual problems of alleged abductees. However, he points out that much of what profession- als \"know\" is not based on actual associations with alleged abductees or study of the phenomena, but rather on general perceptions similar to other members of society. Dr. Resta"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Page 6 August 1999 MUFON UFO Journal Dr. Maccabee Dr. Bruce Maccabee Dr. Bruce Maccabee, who has an extensive back- ground with the National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena (NICAP), the Fund for UFO Re- search (FUFOR), and MUFON, took attendees back to the mysterious \"na- tional emergency\" of Dec. 6, 1950, and the Dec. 8, 1950, \"high alert\" for the Army's Counter Intelli- gence Corps (CIC) in a message which began, \"URGENT. DECEMBER 8. RE: FLYING SAU- CERS.\" Dr. Maccabee suggests a possible connection be- tween these items and a report filed with NICAP by Retired Air Force Col. Robert Willingham in 1977 regarding his observation of what he believed to be a crashed saucer near Del Rio, TX, close to the Texas-Mexico border. The date of this observation has not been determined precisely, but was apparently between Dec. 5 and Dec. 8, 1950. While the \"national emergency\" on Dec. 6 has been documented through several sources, it is not clear what triggered it, although all versions indicate upwards of forty unidentified objects moving from the north to- ward the U.S. Were the \"national emergency\" of Dec. 6 and the \"saucer alert\" on Dec. 8 related? Concludes Dr. Maccabee: \"Will we ever know?\" Robert P. Swiatek Another important case from the 1950s was de- scribed by Robert P. Swiatek, who has been involved with ufology since 1968. This case involved two in- stances of nighttime radar-visual events over Wash- ington, D.C., in July of 1952. On July 19, 1952, at 11:40 p.m. EDT air route traffic controllers Ed Nugent and Harry G. Barnes tracked eight blips on their radar, some 15 miles south-south- west of Washington and moving at 100 to 130 mph. The targets flew erratically and ignored prohibited flight areas, including above the White House and the Capitol. Visual sightings were reported at Andrews Air Force Base nearby, as well as by a pilot of Capital Air- lines. The objects suddenly disappeared from radar, Robert Swiatek apparently due to quick acceleration. On July 26 the UFOs returned to show up on radar screens at Andrews AFB and the ARTCC at National Airport, each reporting as many as 12 objects. A pilot and stewardess of National Airlines also reported the objects, as did a CAA flight inspector flying at 2,200 feet near Baltimore. Two F-94s from New Castle AFB in Delaware were scrambled, but the objects vanished as the planes got close, disappearing both visually and on the plane's radar. Stanton T. Friedman Turning to the question of whether it is possible for aliens to travel to Earth from distant stars, as well as whether it is possible for us to travel from Earth to distant stars, veteran researcher Stanton T. Friedman noted that \"IT DE- PENDS.\" He discussed various theories and prac- tices, including the use of gravity fields of planets, the Sun, and even black holes. He also noted other possible techniques, such as fission, fusion, anti- gravity, energy of the vacuum, lasers spalling off the back end of a rocket, hybrid systems, and laser-plasma systems. Joe Firmage Also speaking was Joe Firmage, who has recently burst onto the UFO scene in a big way, thanks to an extensive advertising cam- paign, a noteworthy presence on the Internet, good press coverage, research funding, a good personality, and many speaking en- gagements before UFO groups. Founder and former CEO and chief strategist of USWeb Corporation, the 28-year-old received the 1997 Young Entrepre- neur of the Year Award. His ufology background includes a personal \"en- counter,\" research into past cases and UFO theo- ries, and discussions with Joe Firmage those of virtually all per- suasions in and but of the UFO field. Firmage said he had \"insider information\" that \"we are on the brink of major scientific discoveries involv- (Continued on Page 7) Stanton Friedman"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal August 1999 Page? Kathy Grimes, assistant state director for Ken- tucky, and Scott Voight, Kentucky state director, met with Symposium attendees at their attractive table. One of their key items was the video tape of the Second Annual Kentucky UFO Conference April 24 featuring talks by Ted Phillips, Stanton Friedman, and John Carpenter.

Firmage suggested that alien teachers are the voices that have historically guided prophets and visionaries, and warned that \"we can use the powers which mod- ern society has developed to destroy ourselves or to ensure a bright and beautiful future.\" Michael Lindemann Press coverage of symposium generally positive, serious By Michael Lindemann Editor, CNI News The annual MUFON symposium drew consider- able attention in the main- stream press. In fact, not since the 50th anniversary bash in Roswell, NM, in July 1997 has any UFO event created such a stir in the U.S. media. The coverage this time was different than in Roswell two years ago. Back then, the press fo- cussed mostly on the carni- val side-show aspects of the event rather than its serious substance. \"ET\" meant one part \"ExtraTerrestrial,\" three parts \"Entertainment Tonight.\" But this time, the tone was decidedly more sober. Major papers from the New York Times to the Wash- ington Times to the Los Angeles Times struggled to come to grips with the core subjects of the conference. In some cases-for example, the New York Times-ihe conference itself was hardly discussed, but was clearly the backdrop and provocation for serious discussion of such topics as alien abduction. Granted, one could easily.find in every article the seemingly obligatory swipes at \"UFO believers,\" the occasional arrogant dismissal of barely understood ideas, and the lame attempts at easy explanations of truly mysterious events. But, all that aside, the cover- age seemed better than in the past-in some ways, quite remarkable. Herewith, some examples: ATTENDANCE: Press estimates ranged from a low of 200 (Salon Magazine) to a high of 700 (Los Angeles Times). The Washington Times put the number at 400. It has been widely observed that the mainstream me- dia tends to underestimate attendance at any politically incorrect gathering, be it an anti-war rally, a gay-pride parade or a UFO conference. That said, the reported figure of 700 attendees would seem to be the low end of probable real attendance-an admirable accomplishment for MUFON. And, noted the Washington Times, \"many of them [were] scien- tists and government workers,\" as well as curiosity seekers, New Agers and the like. TOPICS OF DISCUSSION: Several articles noted that this conference, more than previous MUFON con-"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"PageS August 1999 MUFON UFO Journal ferences, focused heavily on the thorny subject of ab- duction. Without doubt, this could have provided an opening for general derision in the media, but that did not happen. The New York Times used the occasion to publish a long and thoughtful article on the mysteri- ous condition known as \"sleep paralysis\" and its pos- sible relationship to claims of alien abduction. Reporter Nicholas Kristof noted that sleep paralysis is now thought to be much more common than previously as- sumed, and he quoted Japanese researcher Kazuhiko Fukuda, among others, as saying, \"I think it [sleep pa- ralysis] can explain claims of witchcraft and alien ab- duction.\" But he also noted that the connection between sleep paralysis and abduction is unproved. Furthermore, Kristof wrote, \"those who believe in alien abductions deny that sleep paralysis could be behind it all. John E. Mack, a Harvard University Medical School pro- fessor who is the most prominent defender of the pos- sibility of abductions, argues that sleep paralysis sim- ply does not fit the evidence. He notes that at least a few abduction reports come from remote places where people are not exposed to movies or tales of U.F.O.'s, and that many happen in daylight and involve people who seem to have been awake and alert. Other defend- ers of abduction theories say aliens may be clever enough to use sleep paralysis in their kidnappings.\" The Washington Times reported, without derision or attempts at easy answers, the remarkable account of MUFON speaker Kelly Cahill, one of six witness/ participants in an apparent abduction episode near Melbourne, Australia, on Aug. 8, 1993. In this case, several people, including Cahill, emerged from an in- tense, fully conscious UFO encounter with odd physi- cal scars. They immediately reported the events to local po- lice. Researchers from a nearby university found some physical soil anomalies in the area. And Ms. Cahill, a deeply religious person, says that \"her religious con- victions have radically changed since the incident, as the kind of Christianity she had known had no cat- egory for her experience,\" wrote reporter Julia Duin. The Washington Times also made what amounts to a startling admission regarding one of the more famous UFO events in recent memory. By way of explaining that the topic of alien abduction was controversial even in MUFON circles, reporter Duin wrote, \"Normally, the Seguin, Texas-based Mutual UFO Network sticks to more provable phenomena, such as the mysterious, huge V-shaped object that floated above Phoenix for 106 minutes on March 13, 1997. Residents flooded police departments and Luke Air Force Base in nearby Glendale with terrified calls.\" In other venues, this event has been passed off as nothing but military flares. But the Washington Times Budd Hopkins, like many speakers who are also authors, found himself signing numerous books. here acknowledges, without argument, what scores of witnesses insist they really saw-a huge, low-flying, silent \"V\" or boomerang-shaped UFO. ARE \"UFO BELIEVERS\" JUSTIFIED AFTER ALL? Among the more remarkable press comments to emerge in the wake of the MUFON conference, in my view, is the following from Los Angeles Times writer James Pinkerton: \"While one can easily make fun of flying saucer followers, and while all of them are likely misguided in their particulars [!], they're probably right in general: Something is out there. And whether it becomes known to us in the next year or the next thousand years, all those who watched and waited by the sky horizon will have earned their vindication... The next thousand years will quite possibly be remem- bered as the era when They find us-or we find Them.\" Pinkerton apparently couldn't help opining that '^all of them are likely misguided in their particulars'^ stupidly inaccurate gaffe in an otherwise intriguing observation. And his article does contain a number of other blatantly derisive remarks as well. He, more than some other writers, seems almost disoriented by the ideas he is trying to discuss. He can't help poking fun- it's his defense against full acceptance of shocking new possibilities. In this Pinkerton is hardly alone. The prospect of actually accepting visitation from elsewhere remains, for many people, a deeply unnerving thing. But if the press coverage accompanying the recent MUFON con- ference is any indication, it appears we are no longer in the decades-long era when blatant, arrogant dismissal of UFO claims was standard operating procedure. Things are more complicated now. Thinking journalists are starting to think very un- comfortable thoughts. Perhaps they can be forgiven for sounding confused. All things considered, I see this as progress."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal August 1999 Page 9 Cassini flies past Venus Danger of Cassini flyby on way to Earth flyby seen as one in a million The Cassini spacecraft, marking the 617th day of its voyage to Saturn, successfully completed its sec- ond flyby of the planet Venus on June 24, once again on time and on target. As planned, Cassini came within 600 kilometers (about 370 miles) of the planet at 1:30 p.m. Pacific time, with Venus' gravity giving the spacecraft a boost in speed to help it reach Saturn more than 1 billion kilometers away. The spacecraft, launched on its voyage Oct. 15,1997, remains in excellent condition as it travels its nearly seven-year trajectory to Saturn. Most of Cassini's sci- entific instruments were set to make observations dur- ing the Venus flyby. Scientific data from the flyby will be transmitted to Earth over coming days. Four flybys of planets-two of Venus and one each of Earth and Jupiter-give Cassini the speed it needs to reach Saturn. Cassini first flew past Venus on April 26, 1998, at a distance of 284 kilometers (about 176 miles). The Venus flyby will be followed by a 1,166- kilometer (724-mile) flyby of Earth on Aug. 18, then it's on to Jupiter for a Dec. 30, 2000, flyby. The giant planet's gravity will bend Cassini's flight path to put it on course for arrival into orbit around Saturn on July 1,2004. Cassini's mission is to study the ringed planet, its magnetic and radiation environment, moons and rings for four years. Cassini will also deliver the European Space Agency's Huygens probe to parachute to the sur- face of Saturn's moon Titan. Titan is of special interest partly because of its many Earthlike characteristics, including a mostly nitrogen atmosphere and the presence of organic molecules in the atmosphere and on its surface. Lakes or seas of ethane and methane may exist on its surface. The Cassini mission is a joint effort of NASA, the European Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The mission is managed and the Cassini spacecraft built and operated by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, CA. JPL is a division of the California In- stitute of Technology.

Add your name to his list, currently totaling more than 300, by sending name, state, title (such as State Section Di- rector, Field Investigator) to: Alienchasr@aol.com By Walter N. Webb Regarding the Cassini Saturn spacecraft and its al- leged risk to Earth during its Aug. 18 flyby of Earth, I asked my brother Dave (a space physicist) to consult NASA/JPL's Cassini web site for me. To respond to critics, the JPL site has come up with a true-false list of comments about the risks posed by Cassini. I, for one, am satisfied with JPL's answers. I've excerpted the most meaningful ones below: FALSE: No failure probability of NASA spacecraft can be as low as one in one million. TRUE: . . . The accidental swingby reentry prob- ability of less than one in one million may be surpris- ing to some people (at first), since it is difficult to prove that failures of any system, particularly spacecraft, can be that small. The result is driven by two factors: First, for most of the Cassini trajectory it is very hard to hit the Earth. In fact, until about 50 days before Earth swingby, the probability of hitting the Earth is much less than one in one million, regardless of spacecraft failure. (This is because of the vastness of space, the smallness of the Earth as a target, and the randomness of a spacecraft failure or micrometeoroid hit leading to a velocity change.) Second, JPL has \"biased\" the trajectory for Earth swingby. This scheme further limits the time and events that could cause inadvertent reentry by eliminating all fail- ures except those that give the spacecraft the proper ve- locity magnitude and direction to impact the Earth. The spacecraft is biased 5,000 kilometers [about 3,000 miles] or more away from the swingby altitude (about 1,160 km) [about 700 miles] for all but about 7 days prior to the swingby. Additionally, the navigation accuracy of NASA spacecraft is better than 20 km [12 mil]. The biasing strategy effects, coupled with redundant spacecraft system design, built-in fault detection and cor- rection systems, and controlled operation (via sending commands to the spacecraft), particularly during the lim- ited time when failures could cause impact, lead to the exceedingly small probability of Earth impact. In addi- tion, these analyses are constantly being reviewed and refined, and revisions made in spacecraft design to ensure that the design requirement will not be exceeded. FALSE: A single spacecraft failure or small misfire of the Cassini engines would result in an Earth reentry accident. TRUE: The probability of an inadvertent Earth reentry is extremely unlikely-less than one in one mil- lion-even in the event of a spacecraft failure or misfire of Cassini's engines. A swingby accident is conceiv- able only if an extremely unlikely sequence of events"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"Page 10 August 1999 MUFON UFO Journal and failures occurs. The vast majority of possible space- craft failures would not alter the spacecraft's trajec- tory. A micrometeoroid impact or spacecraft failure would have to cause a change to the spacecraft's ve- locity of exactly the proper magnitude and direction to place it on an impacting trajectory. Cassini's trajectory will never be pointed directly at the Earth. Only a very small fraction of the micro- meteoroid impacts or failures that could possibly change Cassini's velocity would ever place the space- craft on an Earth-impacting trajectory. Additionally, if a spacecraft failure did occur, it would have to be so severe that neither automated on-board systems nor their backup system nor flight controllers could take corrective action to place the spacecraft on a non-im- pacting trajectory. The Antero Alii news release sounds a bit alarmist to me, especially since Alii seems to imply some sort of connec- tion between the Cassini pass and the prior week's solar eclipse. And DeStefano and Werbe speak of \"prophetic tra- ditions\" about Cassini. Not sure what those might be. At any rate, three radioisotope thermoelectric gen- erators (RTGs) aboard Cassini supply electrical power by converting the heat from plutonium decay. RTGs are used on deep space probes simply because at those distances sunlight is too dim to permit power genera- tion from solar panels. Currently there are no alternatives to plutonium power sources for long-distance, long-duration space missions. However, plutonium generators have been used many times without incident. They were most recently used on Mars Pathfinder's rover to keep the system from failing during the frigid Martian nights.

Spring, 1999, \"Strange Evidence,\" by Bill Chalker, Page 3. Editor: Jerome Clark. Reviewed by Dwight Connelly The background An Australian case involving a possible alien hair sample and DNA testing of that hair sample was re- ported in great detail in the spring issue of IUR. The investigation and article were done by Bill Chalker, one of the leading researchers in Australia. Like many UFO cases, this one has some bizarre twists. However, the case appears to be solid and sig- nificant as far as it goes, although quite incomplete. The only witness in this case is Peter Khoury, who was born in Lebanon in 1964 and migrated to Austra- lia in 1973. He met his wife Vivian in 1981, they mar- ried in 1990, and they have two children. Khoury owns a cement rendering business. His first exposure to a possible UFO was in Febru- ary of 1988 when he and Vivian saw a strange light making extraordinary movements in connection with a beam of light. Then on July 12 of that same year he says he experienced the following: He was lying in bed when something grabbed his ankles, causing a strange numbness to move all the way to his head. He was paralyzed, except for his eyes. Suddenly there were three or four figures in dark robes to the right of his body. The entities, three or four feet tall, communicated with him telepathically, telling him he would not be harmed. As he moved his eyes to the left, he noticed two beings who were quite different from those on his right. They were tall, thin, gold in color, and had big black eyes and narrow chins. He said that the one near- est to him communicated with him telepathically, tell- ing him not to worry, and that it would be like the last time. The being's eyes seemed to express emotion, almost like a smile. Then Khoury saw a long needle-like flexible tube, which the being inserted to the top left side of Khoury's head, and at this point Khoury blacked out. When he regained consciousness he bolted from the bed and rushed into the TV room where his father and brother were, and they appeared to be asleep. Khoury awak- ened his brother, who appeared groggy. By compar- ing the TV programming, they determined that there had been two hours of missing time. The next day he told Vivian what had happened,"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal August 1999 Page 11 and noticed dried blood under his fingernail after he had touched the spot where the needle had been in- serted. Vivian took a closer look and reported a punc- ture hole. Khoury went to his family doctor for a checkup, and the doctor noted the puncture hole and said Khoury must have hit his head on a nail at work. Khoury ex- plained what had happened, and the doctor responded by laughing. Khouri felt that, besides Vivian, he had no one to talk to who would believe him. He knew he had physical marks, including a wound on his shin that was similar to a biopsy. Months later Khoury and Vivian saw a billboard advertising Whitley Strieber's book Communion, and the gray on the billboard was similar to the creatures he had seen. Vivian and Khoury obtained the book and read it. He found that it corresponded to his expe- rience in many ways, but was also different in many ways. Khoury, still seeking more information, tried to find a hypnotist who would regress him, but was ini- tially unsuccessful. Finally he heard of a UFO group, and began attending meetings, soon being designated the group's \"abduction coordinator.\" He stayed with the group for about a year, but felt it did not provide the type of help he was seeking. On July 23,1992, Khoury had the experience which eventually led to the DNA testing of the possible alien hair. At the time, he was on medication (Panadeine Forte) and in a great deal of pain as a result of head .injuries received from an attack by three individuals at a job site. He reports that he vomited frequently as a result of the injuries.  ^~ The incident began after he took his wife to work in the morning, then returned to bed and fell asleep. Sud- denly he sat bolt upright, and immediately saw two naked females sitting on his bed. He had been under the covers, but was now lying on top of the covers. Khoury reports that he seemed to be viewing the scene through the back of his head, and seemed to see part of himself as well as the two women. The female in front of him was blonde, in her mid- thirties, light skin, a head and a half taller than the six- foot Khoury, protruding cheeks that were very high, a long nose, normal size mouth and lips, longer and more pointed face than normal for humans, eyes two or three times as large as usual for humans, and normal female breasts. Khoury says she looked \"humanoid,\" but he was aware he was not looking at a human. She was sitting on her calves, so the pubic hair, if any, could not be observed (possibly significant in light of further developments). Her blonde hair seemed \"pretty weird\" to Khoury, coming about half way down her back and covering her ears. He described it as \"exotic,\" but \"wispy\" in a way, nicely done, but \"frail\" and even \"flimsy,\" as if it were not very strong. The other female had very straight, stiff black hair that looked artificial, and had the appearance of an Asian, \"but too extreme, as if she had been punched in the cheek by Mike Tyson.\" She was shorter than Khoury, with very dark eyes that were too large for humans and devoid of emotion or life. The blonde seemed to be in charge, as if showing the other one how to interact with Khoury. Initially only two feet away, the blonde reached out and pulled Khoury to her breast forcefully, showing no emotion. He said he felt she was physically stronger, despite the fact that he is a rather large, well-built individual. He resisted, and was again pulled toward her breast. The third time he was pulled to her breast he bit her nipple, and swallowed a portion, which got stuck in his throat. He says he does not know why he did that, but suggests that perhaps it was a way of resisting what she was forcing him to do. He was surprised to see no blood, saying it was like biting a plastic dummy. The blonde seemed surprised, indicating by her ex- pression that this was not the way it was supposed to be done. Khoury started coughing, trying to dislodge what had stuck in his throat, and suddenly the two women were gone and he was again viewing things through his own eyes in a normal manner. Khoury, still coughing badly, went to the bathroom to get a drink of water. He also had a strong urge to urinate, and as he began to do so he felt terrible pain in his penis. He pulled the circumsized foreskin back and discovered a hair tightly wrapped and twisted around his penis, with a smaller hair intertwined. He said it was very painful to untangle. Realizing that it might be connected to his recent experience, he placed the flimsy hair in a plastic bag and sealed it. The longer hair was about 10-12 centi- meters in length, whitish rather than blonde, and thin. He said it did not curl, but had a spring to it. He imme- diately connected it to the blonde. Khoury noted that he had showered the previous night, and that he and Vivian had not had sex since the shower. He says the object that was lodged in his throat was suddenly gone after three days, and his coughing stopped. Khoury kept the hair in the plastic bag, showing it to a few people, but reportedly allowing no one to touch it until it was turned over to the Anomaly Physical Evidence Group (APEG) in April of this year for DNA testing. APEG is reportedly made up of professional scientists who choose to remain anonymous. The testing The analysis of the hair shaft by APEG was done on mitochondrial DNA, which is distinct from chromo- somal DNA. Although present in both sexes, mitochon- dria are transmitted only by women. Control samples"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"Page 12 August 1999 MUFON UFO Journal from Khoury and his wife were also taken. The por- tions analysed were two-cm pieces from just above the roots. The blonde hair was nearly invisible to the naked eye when placed on a glass surface, due to its unusual optical clarity, so it could be handled only under reflected light. The detailed testing procedures are explained in the IUR article. The results Koury's sample hair matched closely with his Eu- ropean background. His wife's hair could not be eas- ily analysed, since it was apparently chemically treated. The blonde hair sample showed five substitutions from the human consensus, which means that it is biologi- cally close to normal human genetics, but of an un- usual racial type. By comparison, Neanderthals differ from modern humans at 27 locations in the same DNA,while chim- panzees differs from humans at 55 locations. A survey of the literature found only four persons out of tens of thousands of individuals with the same DNA results as that of the blonde hair. These four are of the rare Mongoloid Chinese racial type, presum- ably with an Asian appearance and black hair. The implications It is difficult to draw conclusions from this inci- dent, despite the temptation to do so. Although the assumption has been made that the blonde hair came from the blonde female which appeared on Khoury's bed, there is no evidence to support this. He has no recollection of having had sex with this female, or anyone else. If he had been abducted and had sex, it could have been with someone else. For that matter, the hair may have nothing to do with a sexual encounter. Perhaps it was planted for some purpose, since it seems unlikely to have gotten tightly wrapped around Koury's penis accidentally. Why was evidence so blatantly left in this instance, but is so rare in most abduction cases? While the sample was blonde or clear at the time of testing, per- haps it was originally black, but the color was removed by some process that APEG is not familiar with. The encounter with the two females seems to indi- cate that Khoury was dealing with artificial entities, rather than hybrids. What sort of hybrid would not bleed when a nipple is bitten off? Why did the \"Asian\" female's hair look so artificial and her eyes show no sign of life (like a glass eye)? This is not to say that the case is without merit. Per- haps in the future this careful investigation can be tied to others of a similar nature, resulting in an advance- ment of our knowledge of abductions, aliens, hybrids, and evolution. It would be very interesting, for example, if Lloyd Pye's \"Starchild\" turned out to have a similar DNA to that of the blonde hair. Filer's Files By George A. Filer Mutual UFO Network Eastern Director Majorstar@aol.com 609-654-0020 Belgian Triangle UFOs Excellent investigator Bob Durant writes concern- ing Filer's Files #25 that quotes NATO pilots who claim the Belgium case was caused by a secret air- craft. Bob says, \"I have spent a great deal of time study- ing the Belgian UFO wave of 1989-90, and wrote two articles on the topic that were published in the MUFON UFO Journal. The case remains one of the best docu- mented and puzzling in the UFO literature. The rea- son ufologists 'believe' the Belgian government is pre- cisely because of the quick and extremely thorough briefing they gave the public after the events. \"This included the technical radar data from the ground stations as well as the critically important tapes of the cockpit weapons control radar and flight data on the two interceptors. Add to that the tapes of the radio transmissions from and between the interceptors and ground stations. There is a vast amount of data available. \"Unfortunately, your correspondents seem ignorant of it. Of course the possibility of a secret aircraft was given the greatest consideration. This was before the interceptors were launched as well as during the months that followed. The sightings began six months before the interception attempt, and continued for several months after. Nobody suggested a European craft, sim- ply because all involved knew very well that no craft with the performance parameters of the UFO was be- ing produced in Europe. \"Speculation about secret craft focused on Ameri- can airplanes, particularly the Stealth fighters. That's because investigators-unlike your correspondents- knew what they were talking about. Ten years have elapsed since the events in question. That's a very long time in aviation technology. \"So where is this fantastic European craft that ten years ago vastly outperformed the F-16? If only your correspondents would read the details of the intercept, they would appreciate the absurdity of the 'secret air- craft' explanation. \"The intercept was carried out at low altitudes over very densely populated areas.

Terrible risk was taken, and taken only after repeated consultation with NATO members. General DeBrower and the Belgian Minis- ter of Defense continue to answer inquiries by saying that to this day they have no idea what the UFO was. \"I find particularly offensive George Filer's edito- rial comment, \"We gain little by pushing reports that may not be true. Certainly, UFOs could have been involved, but within NATO military circles this ver- sion of the report is considered true.\" \"Really? Exactly which military circles, George? A couple of pilots who were still in high school when the events took place? And who tells an impossible story? I prefer the mountain of technical data, and the 'circles' of the likes of General DeBrower and the Min- ister of Defense. \"The UFO enigma continues to suffer from credu- lity. It seems that no story is too crazy to be believed- and published without a second thought. This 'expla- nation' of the Belgian event(s) is an example, but with a twist. Here the rush to accept an explanation for a UFO case that is at odds with the facts and common sense is coming from within the 'research community.' Historically, this sort of bunk emanated from Project Bluebook. You people almost make me nos- talgic for the old days of 'weather balloon' and 'Planet Venus.'\" Thanks to Bob Durant, MUFON. I wish to point out that I heard similar stories from NATO pilots indicating the Belgian triangles were our secret aircraft with special radars. It is certainly pos- sible that the Belgian government was kept out of the loop at the time and NATO pilots were given false info. It certainly could be UFOs? Brazil BELA ISLAND-On July 7, 1999, two UFOs were seen over the Baleia Beach. The sighting occurred around 12 a.m., and was seen by three residents. They called the police but nothing was found. According to the residents, the UFOs had a strange metallic yellow color and were coming from the ocean, about 25 meters above the water. The objects stayed static, hovering near the beach, emitting a soft sound for 10 minutes, when suddenly they increased their speed and disap- peared. They had no wings. The shape was like a flat cigar 20 meters in length. New York MONTOUR FALLS - A mother and daughter while playing softball saw a UFO on June 18,1999, at 6 p.m. The silver object was the size of a pea at arm's length. It glinted silver in the setting sun as if spinning as it moved away towards the east. It had a textured sur- face that was faceted just like a disco ball. After five minutes, the object made a 90-degree turn to the north and acceleraied out of sight in about a second. The second sighting of the silver object was by six witnesses from the Watkins Glen State Park swimming pool just before 6 p.m. The size was a BB at arm's length. It gained altitude and headed east. The sky was clear again and the glinting was still the same. The duration of the sighting was about 3 minutes. The object again made a left 90-degree turn northward and accelerated away at tremendous speed. Thanks to NY MUFON Investigator Bob Long. Alienchasrf^dol com Idaho sighting reported by several witnesses A mother and her son reported seeing an intensely bright object over their cabin near Lava Hot Springs, southeastern Idaho, on the night of June 20,1999. Half a mile away, a retired Air Force pilot saw the same object from a different perspective. All the witnesses filed reports with Peter Davenport of the National UFO Reporting Center, who then invited them to tell their stories on the June 24 edition of Art Bell's Coast to Coast radio program. Janice Price said that she and her son were sitting on the porch of their cabin that night when the sight- ing began. The night was extremely quiet. The time was about 11:15 pm. \"All of a sudden, this light came through the woods above our home,\" she said. At first, there were four separate flashes of intense light. \"It was like someone had a million-watt flashlight. Like they just shined it down for a second. It hit our drive- way and stopped. Then there was nothing. No noise. It was perfectly still.\" Not knowing what to think, Janice just sat there for several minutes. Then she went inside the door of her cabin for a moment to speak to her brother-in-law. When she turned again to face the outside, \"our house was engulfed in light. There was light all around... It was like an arc-welder light-bright blue-white light. The trees were just lit up, and it was like they were moving. There was something moving above. It almost made you dizzy. The trees were just lit up like day.\" Her son, also on the program, said the brilliant light was above the trees and was moving fast, causing shad- ows to move all around them. \"As she was standing in the door talking to my uncle, I was watching the woods the whole time,\" he said. \"When it started, everything started moving You could see real intense beams of light shining through the trees...

The following report is from UFO researcher Jim Brown of Smithfield, PA. Jim has been an associate of mine for many years, and with his extensive elec- tronics background has built an elaborate magnetic anomaly detector (besides many other devices) in his home. For more information on Jim's UFO research and his other projects, check out his website at: hup:/ /www.hhs.net/jbrown/ By Jim Brown The Magnetic Anomaly Detector (MAD) alarm at my residence was activated at 0108 hrs. 27 April, 1999. On activation, I first checked realtime readings on the unit and confirmed they were outside baseline, indi- cating a valid anomalous condition. Within 30 seconds of the alarm activation, 1 went outside and began ob- servations. Conditions were high altitude broken clouds and haze. Temperature 45 degrees F. Winds were calm. The moon was high in the sky, but was somewhat ob- scured by the haze. Mars and only a few of the bright- est stars were visible. I was not able to see or hear anything out of the ordinary. I continued to observe for about 20 minutes without results. (Two aircraft were seen at high alti- tude over this span of time; these likely were commer- cial aviation. This is not uncommon at this location.) I went back inside and saved the data from the MAD. By this time, the system had established its new baseline level. I cleared the circular buffer, saved data to disk, reset the alarm, and the system was back in its scan mode. As I write this report (0830 hrs. 27 April), there have been no additional alarms reported. Additional Report of Object Sighted by Witnesses (This report was received 18 May regarding the above sighting along the power line which runs 800 feet behind my residence. The sighting occurred about 3 miles east of my location on Chestnut Ridge, 27 April at about 0100 hrs, or approx 8 minutes prior to the activation of the MAD. Data indicates the two events may be related. What follows is an excerpt of the narrative portion of the report currently under investigation. (Names are withheld at the request of witnesses.) ... Me and () were parked along Skyline Drive un- der the power line by Pondfield. About 1 (o'clock), I saw what looked like a star over toward Elliotsville. There wasn't one there a minute before. We watched it and it looked like it was moving slowly toward us. We thought this was strange, but it was probably just a plane. We didn't pay much attention to it for a couple minutes. Next time I looked out I could see it was no plane. I could see it was a bright circle of light sort of like a doughnut. Where the hole was it was glowing a blue color. It was over the power line coming toward us from the east. It looked like a doughnut glowing white with the blue glow in the center. As it went over the car, I heard a humming sound that sort of went through the car. () said she could hear a whistle, but I didn't hear that.

We wanted to report this, but didn't know who to call. ... (The narrative continues with personal info.) 6 June, 1999, Sound duplicated under Test Conditions. A test setup using 3 audio generators, gating con- trol, and a mixer was configured to allow each witness to attempt to duplicate the sound they heard. I inter- viewed each separately, and was present to provide advice on the use of the equipment, not the settings themselves. The witnesses had control over parameters and adjusted the setup as they felt was the most accu- rate representation of the sounds heard. In summary, there were slight discrepancies in the setup, but only to the extent one would expect. One setup was 92 hertz, the other 112. Both added a pulsat- ing sound to the signal, and both said it varied slightly in pulse rate, one said from 8-12 pps, the other from 9- 16. One witness also added a high frequency compo- nent, (the whistle reported previously) at 13 khz. The witness who does not report hearing the whistle does say he has a hearing impairment, and a simple test I performed here using one of the generators confirms he cannot hear above 4.5 khz in one ear and 6 khz in the other. A point of note, the pulse rate superimposed on the magnetic wave from the MAD unit falls within the range both witnesses reported.

Burleson, Ph.D. There can scarcely be anyone interested in the field of UFO studies who has not seen that spectacular photograph that Carl Hart, Jr. took of the Lubbock, Texas Lights in late August 1951, showing a wing-like formation of eigh- teen objects. Mr. Hart, then a freshman in college, took other photos, but the one photo is a classic. The story of the ensuing Blue Book investigation is well known-in the end, the Air Force claimed that the lights were something like highly reflective duck-bottoms, though Ed Ruppelt would later say, in a set of notes only much later declassified, that the objects were not birds but Fireflies! (It doesn't seem to have bothered anybody at the time that each firefly would have needed to be roughly the size of a house.) The initial \"bird\" story was one of convenience, of course, as some witnesses out saucer-hunting after the initial Aug. 25 sighting do indeed seem to have ob- served flights of plovers. A close examination of the famous photo, however, pretty well rules out any orni- thological explanation for the Hart sighting. Getting a close look at the underside of a UFO is a rare treat, and getting such a look at the Lubbock Lights is a bit of a trick even with computers and image pro- cessing software, as the objects in question were origi- nally little more than points of light some thousands of feet overhead. But I have been able to coax some fairly good enhancements out of the digitized images, as the enlargement here will show. While I have made computer files for each of the eighteen lights and have examined them all very closely, I have actually used very few advanced en- hancement techniques, because I obviously want to avoid changing anything fundamental about the Lub- bock objects, e.g. their sh.ipe or surface texture. Basically I have only enlarged the images and ad- justed brightness and contrast levels to try to bring out the detail, and 1 have been rewarded by observing what seems to be an indication of structure on the under- sides of some of the objects. In particular, J am finding a notable suggestion of \"cell\"-likc structure, very reminiscent of what some Roswell witnesses have described, with regard to a kind of \"beehive\" arrangement of cells said to have been observed on the bottom of the Roswell craft at the time of the reported retrieval. If this is so, then it may well be that the Lubbock objects are quite similar to the craft that reportedly crashed near Roswell. In any case, the more 1 look at my computer en- hancements, the more the Air Force's \"duck bellies\" explanation amuses me. A duck would have to have leprosy to look like this. This single object, one of 18 making up the wing- like formation of the Lubbock lights, is greatly en- larged, with increased contrast. Magnetic UFO detector and witnesses...

The ab- sence of the high frequency component reported can- not be used conclusively, since, due to the sample rate of the MAD, this is well above the ability of the in- strument to record. Sample rate is approx. 350 to 400 per second. In conclusion, the similarities between the sound generated by the test and the actual magnetic field re- corded by the MAD appear to be more than coinci- dence; however the source of the magnetic disturbance is still under investigation. To date, no conclusive evidence has been uncovered. 25 June, 1999 Follow up contact of both witnesses. Neither report any subsequent contacts or any new recollections about their original sighting.

That was the circumstance presented in early No- vember 1998 to Georgia State Director Walter \"Tom\" Sheets. Two investigators in a distant part of the state had failed to respond to a situation requiring immedi- ate attention. Tom's quick action not only captured details but indirectly uncovered a supporting witness. The Event A respiratory therapist was driving on Highway 400 toward Atlanta on the morning of Nov 8 The sky was overcast with patchy drizzle and light tog along the route. Nearing the boundary of Forsyth rmd Dawson counties, he noticed a \"swarming\" pattern of six or seven headlight-size white lights at the edge of the cloudcover. The lights all appeared to move indepen- dently, constantly circling one another. Intermittently, one would break away for a few seconds only to return to the grouping. Momentarily another oddity ensued as small dull-grey metal cylinders descended toward the ground. These, which the witness said were roughly 16 inches long and 6 inches in diameter, flew in a controlled fash- ion, coming to within 10 feet or so of the pavement before receding. He and the other motorists intention- ally slowed. Over several minutes perhaps thirty or more cylinders approached in this fashion, some to within a car length or so of their vehicles. At this point, the witness used his cell phone to contact the Forsyth County Sheriff Department. Ten minutes after the intrusion had begun, the last of the cylinders receded and the lights overhead moved through the clouds out of sight. The remainder of the trip was uneventful, leaving this witness, and no doubt other drivers, to wonder \"Whai was that all about?\" The Investigation The following morning Tom Sheets was monitor- ing an Atlanta news-talk radio station (through which he had received previous referrals) when the witness phoned in his account. He then notified two field in- vestigators in the northern part of the state where the witness resided. When after a few days neither had initiated contact, Tom telephoned the witness, conduct- ing an initial fact finding interview. In light of the high-strangeness aspects of the en- counter, Tom convinced him to appear on Atlanta's Fox News TV station a few days later. There, employ- ing studio shadowing of the man's face, the commu- nity heard his account. The station aired the segment twice. On Nov. 16, a woman contacted the Fox station to declare that she too had witnessed something unusual on the morning of Nov. 8. The clothing manufacturer's representative was driving north from the town of Alpharetta (23 miles south of the Forsyth-Dawson county line) at 5:30 a.m., some 35 minutes prior to the man's encounter. She noticed three white oval-shaped lights over tree- tops an indeterminate distance ahead. These, she said, were rotating around one another. She considered the possibility of searchlights for the grand opening of some business, but realized she would also see beams in the light fog. Since she was on her way to tend her horses at nearby stables, she turned off the main road after 10 seconds of viewing the lights and did not see them again. Tom and his wife, a forensic hypnotist, found no evidence of deceit in the demeanor or remarks of ei- ther witness during interviewing. The sheriff depart- ment, they later verified, recorded the man's 911 call, but received no other reports and did not dispatch a cruiser. Nearby Dobbins Air Force Base refused to cooperate regarding an entire series of UFO reports during those autumn months.

I have enjoyed several successes and made a few mistakes, as I said would happen when I first undertook the quest. When the quest began, I had a suspicion, but cer- tainly did not know, what we might find regarding the skull's origin. I still don't know for certain and, as has been true from the beginning, none of us will be cer- tain of its origin until the DNA results are in. However, my extensive hours of research into the dynamics of human deformity have convinced me, in my heart of hearts, that we have an excellent chance of writing an extraordinary chapter in the history of hu- manity with this unlikely project. From the beginning, money has been the one thing holding me back. That's the bad news. The good news is that I have recently been rescued from the abysmal ignominy I was rushing headlong toward. Students of my difficulties gathering money will know that 1 have been seeking in the wide range of between 50K and 100K. because of a plethora of uncertainties regarding the extraction, replication, and comparison processes of DNA, including mitochondrial DNA (which passes down from mothers) and especially nuclear DNA (which gives data on both parents). Recovering and sequencing ancient (older than 50 years) Nuclear DNA was the main financial killer, as was the need to make sure the samples tested were not, shall we say, \"modified\" in any way. These problems are now past. I have recently se- cured the services of a top-flight, world-class DNA lab whose guiding lights have agreed that the Starchild has an excellent chance to prove itself to be \"not entirely human,\" a wonderfully euphuistic phrase that must be used because \"alien\" or \"alien-human hybrid\" will not be technically provable. This lab is capable of doing BOTH the mitochrondrial and nuclear DNA testing, and they have - incredibly enough - offered to secure donations to cover all necessary costs. In other words, they have relieved me of roughly 90% of the financial burden!!! This lab shall remain nameless until their work is done so there is no repeat of the initial mitochondrial test gaffe, in which, trying to be as forthcoming as pos- sible, 1 foolishly announced on the Art Bell Show (some of you might remember it) exactly where the work was being done. Due to that lack of foresight on my part, I ended up getting stiffed by that lab with no results at all after three full months of waiting. So despite my vagueness now, please trust me, this lab has no visible axe to grind and does not seem likely to be corrupted by the process. I am confident they can provide a swift, accurate result (the timeframe is still eight to twelve weeks, start to finish, meaning a result no later than October). Remember, too, that if we are not happy with the result, or suspect it might have been \"modified,\" we can always do it again at another lab. We have four solid shots at it (four teeth), so we won't be without recourse if this one doesn't go our way. And since the entire process is free, we really have nothing to lose by giving them the first shot at producing a valid set of DNA comparisons. All in all, this is the very best piece of news to come out of the entire five months, and I am absoltely delighted about it. Now we come to the still-sticky part of the wicket. Though the lab will be picking up all costs for the DNA testing (a clear indication of how strongly they feel the result might prove positive), they are NOT picking up the tab for the peripheral testing that still needs to be done. Those tests include a Carbon 14 test to date the skulls; an endocranial cast to tell us what the child's brain surface was like, whether it had two lobes or three, and whether it had a cerebellum or not (right now it looks as if it didn't, which doesn't seem compatible with life as we know it); a neutron spectroscopy test to tell us all we can leam at present about the chemistry of the bone; and to create a forensic sculpture in clay showing what the child's head might have looked like in life. Also, it would be valuable to have extensive, highly detailed analyses from eye experts, nose experts, ear experts, neck experts, etc. Lloyd^Pye Author of Everything You Know is Wrong Dr. Leir recovering As most of you know, I was hospitalized a couple of weeks ago with a heart attack. This was most probably related to undue stress applied to me from a number of factors including problems with the medical board, which magically happened after my book [The Aliens and the Scalpel] hit the market. In addition, I had a number of attacks on me and my work placed on the internet.

The more professionals I can involve will help to insure that this work will be carried on in the event anything happens to me. Dr. Roger Leir Looking for answers Dear Mr. Connelly. I live in Houston, Texas. A few years ago, Larry King had a female guest on his show, a woman who said she had a childhood experience of seeing a small, glowing \"man\" in her room that at first had the face of her father's, then changed. She said, \"It had my father's face, because that's how they...\" and King interrupted her, she never finished her statement. She was on with a UFO investigator, a man I've seen before, but don't know his name. I very much need to get in touch with this woman. I was stunned, as the same thing happened to me in Houston when I was either four, five or six years old. (I was born in 1942.) My mother is still alive, and she remembers this incident. I awoke in the middle of the night to find a small light moving horizontally across my room. I was sitting up in bed and it seemed to come from my closet, moved horizontally, then stopped to the right of the base of my bed, and \"grew\" into a little figure that seemed to be made of sparklers. I strained to look at it, then saw that is had my father's face on it, and I said either aloud, or to myself, \"Daddy.\" The face seemed to be tilted a little bit, though, like it didn't fit, then as it approached, it's face changed to something that horrified me, though I can't tell you what it looked like. I screamed, and my mother came into the room and told me I was having a nightmare. She said that was what nightmares were. You thought you were awake, but were not. I am now 57 years old, have had many bad dreams, but never another where I knew I was awake. This event has affected me my entire life, has made me afraid to sleep in a house alone, and I often tremble when speak- ing of it. I've not been able to find any UFO chat rooms, bulletin board, etc., at all. Is there any way at all I might be able to contact the woman on King who had the same experience? It might very well be that we have had only a men- tal aberration, which I think is interesting in itself, as we had the same one, and the \"father\" connection might be interesting to study. Any and all consideration you might give to my letter will be greatly appreciated. Thank you, Kay Editor's Note: In talking with Kay about the above request, she added the following: I saw this just once, have never experienced 'miss- ing time,' and never recall seeing a UFO. However I've recently learned of a situation I supposedly witnessed, along with others, of which I have no recollection. My ex-husband told me that as we were driving on the Southwest Freeway in Houston in the mid to late '60's, we saw in the vicinity of Rice University an ob- ject the size of a football field rise up and hover, then go straight up and disappear. He says that many people saw it, that cars were pulled over, and people were out of their cars, and that I wanted to find a phone to call someone to report it. He says we couldn't find a phone, and went to my parent's house instead, where I called Ellington Air Force Base and had a long discussion with someone. When my ex told me this, in the early 90's, I told him he had his wives mixed up, that this had never hap- pened while he and I were married. Later, I mentioned it to my mother who said she remembered it well. She said we were both very upset and she couldn't believe I didn't remember the inci- dent. My younger sister, who was living at home at the time, also remembers it. My mother says I returned to her house the next day and spoke again with someone at Ellington, but this makes no sense as I had a phone at home and would have no reason to go to my parent's house to make a call. (Is there a chronology of old 'sightings' that might make reference to this?) That is the extent of my UFO experience (except for a few smaller things that have bothered me which I will not bore you with now.) I am so sorry this is lengthy and that I've taken up your time, but there are very few I can discuss this with who don't tend to look at me a little sideways. Thank you again, for responding to my letter. Any help you might give me in solving these puzzles will be most welcomed. Kay. How about it readers? I have Kay's address (which she wants to keep private for now) and last name, and will forward responses to her."},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal August 1999 Page 19 An interpretaton of Ramey letter This is a preliminary reading of a letter which Gen- eral Roger Ramey held in his hand at his famous July 8, 1947, Fort Worth press conference while he de- bunked the \"Roswell Incident.\" He characterized the material as a downed weather balloon rather than a strange aerial craft. Prints of the photo-flash pictures taken at the Fort Worth conference survive, including one in which the General clasps the message in his left hand. Following speculation that a computer-enhanced reading might be successful, ufologist Stanton Friedman made avail- able a CD-ROM of the teletype letter. From a copy, Tom Carey graciously gave me two differently-manipulated print-outs. A copy on page 16 of the January, 1999 MUFON UFO Journal also proved useful. A few words of the message are read immediately by everyone, and they definitely relate the message to the incident: \"AT FORT WORTH, TEX... THE 'DISK.'\" Beyond that, readings vary widely. It seems reasonable to assume that the message is a terse but clear government or military message indended to in- form or to direct. The message is unlikely to have been a Top Secret document. With uncleared reporters and a flash cam- era present, the safest place for such a message would have been under lock and key. Nevertheless, carefully chosen language might have avoided the need to clas- sify the message. Only the central and right-hand parts of the lower half of the twice-folded message are clearly visible in the photograph. The few easily-read words evidently were printed on that part of-the thin, wrinkled paper which happened to lie perpendicular to the light rays from the flashbulb. Everything else is fuzzy at best and dark and smudged at worst. Therefore a disciplined method is essential. Tele- printers used fixed-width characters, allowing the analysis to begin with the discipline of a grid which resembles that of a crossword puzzle. Carefully that grid can be expanded from the easily read words over the least-wrinkled parts of the letter. Spaces with char- acters and blanks between words can be differentiated on that grid. Three references were useful, Roswell Report, a Historical Perspective shows an FBI message of the same subject and date on page 8. It also provides gen- eral background information for the period. Interna- tional UFO Reporter Spring, 1997 and Winter, 1998, provides valuable organizational information. At this point, an attempt was made to read the letter; and the result follows: Line #11:....WERE OFF LOADED AT RAF [Roswell Army Air Field] 12: ... AND THE REMAINS OF THE WRECK YOU FORWARDED TO THE 13: [EIGHTH AIR FORCE] AT FORT .WORTH, TEXAS, [end paragraph] 14: ... IN/ON THE \"DISK\" TOO/TWO THUS TAKE FOR HIGHER AGENCY, 15: ...

CAN [forget] THIS AND LOAN/IAND/ LEND... CREWS/CRAFT. 19: ... ER [sender] Please note that the words \"EIGHTH AIR FORCE\" can be fit on line 13 under and to the left of the General's thumb. If this interpretation of lines 11-13 is correct, the addressee (\"YOU\" of line 12) likely is someone at Roswell Army Air Field, but not necessarily its com- manding officer, Colonel Blanchard. If the message had been sent from Eighth Air Force at Fort Worth, that place name would simply have been \"HERE.\" The message may be one sent outside command channels. The names on line 15 (if that is what they are) may be persons with whom the addressee is to coordinate. This message may have come down an in- telligence-collection channel in reverse direction to the flow of material. John R. Pawson 3505 Moreland Rd., Apt.

I have faced all sorts of practical problems during field investigations, and un- derstand that sometimes you have to improvise. You also have to persevere and keep digging. This team has done a com- mendable job of obtaining tes- timony and establishing the basic facts. Certainly, this case ranks as one of the spookier ones on record. It will be very interesting to see whether record searches are able to turn up other ex- Richard Hall amples of this seemingly unique configuration, and if so, what the object was doing. The wobbling, oscilla- tory motion, of course, has been a well-established UFO feature for decades. Even though the phenomena being investigated by the BLT Research Team are not known to be associ- ated with UFOs beyond a reasonable doubt, the kind of hard-core science they are trying to perform is very welcome. I have not read much about the circumstances of the \"grass rings\" in Maryland, my state of residence, so I have only these comments. We have had a pro- longed, almost serious drought here for quite some time. \"Lush green\" grass rings of any kind would require some extraordinary source of moisture. In the past, simi- lar rings often have been identified as fungus (\"fairy circles\"), but that seems unlikely under current condi- tions. The reporting of the two similar photo events, in contrast, I find to be severely flawed on many counts. I will only mention a few. These \"UFOs\" never did much of anything UFO-like to begin with, like rapidly accel- erate, make sharp turns, or even clearly differentiate themselves from aircraft or balloon activity. Several subjective, interpretive elements are intro- duced into the reporting which do not necessarily logi- cally follow at all. A cluster of balloons with attached payloads, for example, could easily appear to \"morph\" while turning and twisting in the wind. As for alleg- edly unmarked helicopters, since identification mark- ings sometimes are deliberately made difficult to see, how do the reporters conclude what they do? Can they say that they were sufficiently close to the helicopters (like they were right overhead with details of the air- frame clearly visible) to conclude with certainty that no markings were present? And why the entirely gratuitous comment, \"No missing time was experienced during this event\"? How much of the witnesses prior belief system is being im- posed on the facts of these events? The \"now-it-can-be-told\" radar-visual sighting by the retired Air Force pilot is the kind of case that needs to be brought forth to demonstrate to important people how serious the UFO evidence is. I hope the witness will sign a full report that can at least be released after his death. Over the years, I have talked with and interviewed many military pilots who have described very similar aerial encounters that made instant \"believers\" out of them. Regrettably, the \"ridicule factor\" prevents them from talking openly. The \"science notes\" by Dick Haines and Chris Rutkowski (oops! sorry about that typo in your by- line, Chris), and of course my long time good friend Walt Webb, add substance to this issue. And, we are all on pins and needles as to where Steven Spielberg is headed with his abduction miniseries. One hopes he is seeking out sane, clear- headed sources of information on this much-abused and philosophically difficult subject. Finland UFO statistics reported By Ilkka Serra Representative for Finland The UFO Research of Finland gathered 34 sighting reports relating to the year 1998 (64 cases in 1997), so it was a quiet year. However, 29% (10 cases) remain unexplained (day- light discs and nocturnal lights). Two cases contained too little information, 13 sightings were identified, and nine cases were probably unknown. There were 208 UFO-related stories in newspapers, and 75 stories in magazines. We also gathered about a hundred old sightings re- lating to earlier years."},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal August 1999 Page 21 SAN ANTONIO UFO CONFERENCE 36th Annual National UFO Conference in San Antonio, TX.

The fad- ing red planet sets about 10 PM in mid-September. On the 16th compare the color of Mars and Antares as the planet passes 3 degrees N of the star. (Mars is about half a magnitude brighter.) Jupiter (-2.8) and Saturn (-0.3) still occupy Aries, rising in the E about 8:30 and 9:10, respectively, in mid-month. Both gas giants move westward in the sky during the night. Bright Planets (Morning): Venus reappears in the eastern morning sky, rising before 4 AM in mid-September. By dawn the brilliant object stands about 30 degrees above the ESE hori- zon. It achieves its brightest in the morning sky on the 26th, shining then at magnitude -4.6. Around that time the planet exhibits a crescent phase in small telescopes. Jupiter and Saturn arrive at points high in the S W at dawn. The brighter of the pair, Jupiter, lies near the gibbous Moon on Sept. 27. The Moon moves near Saturn the following morning. Mars \"Invasion\" Continues: This month Mars Climate Orbiter, launched last December, joins the highly successful Mars Global Surveyor in orbit around the red planet. While MGS continues its detailed photomapping of the Martian surface, Climate Orbiter will also take images and study the seasonal changes in the atmosphere and on the sur- face. When a third craft, Mars Polar Lander, touches down on the planet in December, Climate Orbiter will use its radio to relay data from the lander back to Earth.

The shadows were moving around everything. And then it got over a big pine tree and just lit every- thing up.\" Hoping to get a better view, he ran to the end of the deck as the object appeared to move away. \"The house was still blocking the view, but I could barely see it, and it was just heading out into a big open spot where I could see it... and that was the last I could remem- ber- Somehow, the son's memory of what happened next was apparently interrupted. \"The next thing I remem- ber, I was staring down and it was pitch black,\" he said. \"It really scared me. It happened so fast... The last I recall, it was coming over the house, and I was thinking, 'Great, I'm going to see it, the whole thing.' But just as it was popping out into the open area, boom. Just black.\" He then realized he was facing away from where the object had last been. \"I had to turn back around to look at where it was before,\" he said. The obvious dis- continuity in the young man's memory suggests a pe- riod of missing time, but it is not clear whether, or how much, time might have elapsed. Meanwhile, not far away, a retired Air Force pilot was lying in bed gazing out the window of his cabin when he was startled by a brilliantly lit object. Owen Mitchell, also a guest on Art Bell's program, said he had retired two years ago after 26 years active duty as a pilot, with nearly 20,000 hours of flight time. His cabin is located about a half mile north and slightly downhill from the Price cabin. Mitchell said he had just closed his eyes for a few seconds when \"an extremely bright, intensely bright light startled me.\" Bolting awake, he saw \"a round ob- ject, traveling east to west at an elevation of about 60 degrees in the sky.\" He was sure it was an object, but not like anything he had seen before. \"I saw the entire object. It was above the trees. It was very, very bright - like an arc-welder. You could hardly look at it.\" But it was so fascinating, he said, that he could not take his eyes off it despite the brightness. \"It lit up the whole canyon, the trees, everything... I saw it for about two seconds at most. It was a round ball-shaped object. The center was a brilliant white, and as it went out toward the edges, it had a bluish tinge to it,\" he said. Mitchell is sure the object was heading almost di- rectly west-the opposite direction from that reported by the Prices. Evidently, the object had turned around in the span of a few minutes, proving it could not be a fireball meteor. Like the Prices, he said there was no sound associated with the sighting. Looking at a clock just after his sighting, he saw the time was 1 l:18pm."},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"Page 24 August 1999 MUFON UFO Journal DIRECTOR'S MESSAGE Walter Andrus NEWS FROM AROUND THE NETWORK Walt Andrus to retire as International Director Effective July 16, 2000, I will retire as MUFON's International Director after serving for thirty years in this capacity. This announcement was made at the MUFON Annual Board of Directors Meeting in Ar- lington, VA, on July 4, 1999. Article IV Corporation Officers, Section 1, para- graph (d) of the MUFON Bylaws states: \"In case of a vacancy in the office of International Director, the Deputy Director of Administration shall succeed to this office, thereby vacating the office of Deputy Di- rector of Administration.\" This is taken directly from the MUFON Bylaws dated March 1982. John F. Schuessler (Littleton, CO) is the reigning Deputy Di- rector of Administration and a founding member of MUFON in 1969. In response to the board meeting agenda item listed by Walt Andrus, Dan Wright moved that the MUFON headquarters be moved to the Denver metropolitan area by Sept. 1,2000, which was approved by the MUFON Board of Directors. At the request of Carolyn McNellis, the Board se- lected a committee to submit by Jan. 15, 2000, (1) a five-year long range objectives plan for MUFON (pref- erably in one-year steps), (2) revise the existing by- laws, and (3) consider an organizational restructure. The committee is composed of Dan Wright, Chair- man; Tom Whitmore; Tom Deuley; Carolyn McNellis; George Filer; and Herbert Prouty. The target dates for the transition complied with the wishes of your International Director, since this major move could be accomplished in a well-planned, pro- fessional manner without disruption in service to our members or the organization. From a personal view- point, I had wanted the transition to be completed be- fore my eightieth birthday on Dec. 12, 2000. Everyone in MUFON will benefit with the leader- ship in the hands of John F. Schuessler, who is far more qualified in education and industrial management than your present director, and new confidence in the revitalized Board of Directors.

David Spencer, former Deputy Director of In- vestigations, has produced a CD-ROM with more than 800 UFO sighting reports that have been investigated by MUFON and entered into the computerized data base through MUFON's Computer Input Form 2 and other information in the reports.
