Cannori . -- & -- __ ___ __ ____-------__------------------------ _____L______-_---__---------------------------- The August issue of SKYLOOK had the re~ort of a 27 ft. diameter ring left on the farm of Leo Paul Chaput, Ont2ri0, Canada, and the October issue carried the report of a 40-fi diameter ring in the soybean field of the Warren Barr farm in Iowa. Brian C. Cannon,'APRO.investigator and contributing editor to the fine-CANADIAN UFO REPORT, and frequent contributor to SKYLGOK, informs us thes,e circles of scorched or flattened vegetation have.bzen fcund not -only in .Canada and the United States, but also in .E;ur-ope, Australia -and South Amerika. Nearly all ays a UFO has been seen at the time, and-' it would seem this indicates something more than just coincidence. . The Chaput circle was obse,rved on May 11, the morning after the fam- ily had been awakened by their dog barking and had seen a UFO. Mr. Cannon ,rep,orts another circle, 32 fc~t in dipmeter, and part of a third one were also found. In e~ch of the two large circles, inpressions had been made in the earth which, if joined by straight lines, would have formed a perfect equilateral triangle. On June 2nd, this yezr, another circle was seenbonthe John McLaren 300-acre farm near Meath, Ontario. The McLaren children discovered the circle measuring 35 feet in diameter. A re~ltor, who had. been over the area two days befor.e, said he was certain the circle was' not there at : that time. A 2$ ft. ring of burned grass outlined the circle. In this case, no UFO had been reported in the vicinity but nsomething'v had been there, ., Many UFO sightines in Canada this summer centered ~round~Allurnette ' Lzke snd the Ottawa -Rivl r near'the Canadi~n Forces Base at Petawawa, Ontario. . . -.

He stepped from his car to observe the round,-clearly defined object whose light brightened and dimmed at regular intervals.
