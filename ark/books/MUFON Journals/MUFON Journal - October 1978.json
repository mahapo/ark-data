FROM THE EDITOR When any human endeavor lacks a unifying theory, and goals or purposes are vague, the result normally is chaos. That word — \"chaos\" — might best describe the current state of so-called \"UFOlogy.\" Differences of opinion about what lines of research or investigation ought to be pursued continue to be a divisive force, despite some recent moves toward closer cooperation among UFO groups. In my view, we are all (except con-men, opportunists, and exploiters) engaged in a truth-seeking exercise. One unifying force should be the desire to expose dishonesty and falsehoods. Another, considering the lack of any unique pipeline to \"truth,\" should be tolerance of any scientific or logical approaches to the study of UFO data, whether or not we are particularly enthusiastic about the individual project, because resources are scarce and any honest effort deserves support. Premature or ill-founded theories, on the other hand, can be detrimental to the search for truth. Presumably we are in the position described in the ancient fable of the blind men and the elephant. One of us may have the elephant by the tail, and insist that it is a rope-like creature, while another may be grasping its leg absolutely certain that \"elephants\" are tree-like. Perhaps if we stop arguing about who is in the best position to describe the \"real\" elephant and we share information, a clearer picture of the whole animal might emerge.

Last year, the Assembly approved a consensus statement to the effect that a draft resolution submitted by Grenada (document A/SPC/32/- L.20), calling for research into \"unidentified flying objects and related phenomena,\" together with the statements made by Grenada on this subject, be transmitted to Member States and to the specialized agencies for their views (decision 32/424 of 13 December 1977). The replies received from Governments and specialized agencies were circulated by the Secretary-General in a report dated 6 October (document A/33/268). . . . This morning's meeting was called to order by the Chairman of the Special Political Committee, - Rodolfo Piza Escalante (Costa Rica), at 11:01 a.m. After reviewing the documents before the Committee on this item, he welcomed the presence of the Prime Minister of Grenada, who thus took the floor to introduce the item. Sir Eric Matthew Gairy, Prime Minister of Grenada, said he had come here to present the item because of his \"deep personal conviction\" that the subject of UFOs was one of \"world- wide importance and significance\", and, indeed, one which warranted very serious consideration by the United Dr. J. Allen Hynek addressing UN Special Political Committee (United Nations photo by Y. Nagata) Nations. The recent report of the abduction of a Cessna aircraft in Australia seemed to him to be a compelling reason for the United Nations to come alive to its responsibilities and take a serious look at the UFO phemomenon to which planet earth has been conspicuously exposed since 1947,\" he said. However, the recent incident in Australia, which had been given world- wide publicity, was only one of tens of thousands of such incidents reported by persons in nearly every corner of the globe \"who have demonstrated some measure of courage,\" he went on. UFOCAT, a computerized catalogue of reported sightings, had listed over 60,000 cases drawn from virtually all parts of the world. This listing, he added, undoubtedly excluded, perhaps in equal number, many sightings \"that people have failed to report for fear of being ridiculed.\" In 1975, Grenada had raised the (continued on next page) 3"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Press conference at United Nations, November 27,1978.

Again in 1976 it had raised this subject. In 1977, it has emphasized its concern because of the rapidly growing interest manifested in the subject all over the world, the magnitude of which had been gathering momentum. Earlier this year, in the General Assembly, Grenada had again re- emphasized the need for establishing an agency to study to origin, the nature and intention of that particular phenomenon. However, his delegation had made clear that Grenada was flexible as to the mechanism to be established for conducting and co- ordinating the type of research envisaged. It was concerned about the \"newness\" of the item within United Nations circles, and also about the high cost of establishing an agency or department. Sir Eric went on to say that many people might wonder about Grenada's preoccupation with a subject such as UFOs. The answer, as he had stated before, was that the world was so pre- occupied, with international problems affecting individual countries that it often seemed to forget \"international matters relating to earth as one planet.\" \"It is presumptuous for men to believe that they are God's only intelligent beings and that no other intelligent life exists on other planets,\" he remarked. \"Such a belief is a gross fallacy. Indeed, we are all, no doubt, aware of the increasing number of attempts being made, by the use of high-level technology, to confirm the existence of extra-terrestrial life.\" (UN Press Release GA/AH/1478, 27 November 1978) The Special Political Committee met this afternoon to continue consideration of the item submitted by Grenada, on unidentified flying objects. Consideration of the item began this morning, with statements by the Prime Minister .of Grenada, Sir Eric Gairy; the Minister of Education of Grenada, Wellington Friday; and three experts who appeared as part of the delegation of Grenada: J. Allen Hynek, Jacques F. Vallee, and Lt. Col. Larry Coyne . . . Statement by Gordon Cooper This afternoon's meeting was called to order by the Chairman of the Special Political Committee, Rodolfo Piza Escalante (Costa Rica), at 3:42 p.m. Wellington Friday, Minister of Education of Grenada, read out the text of what he called \"a very informative document\" sent to his delegation by Gordon Cooper, former United States astronaut, who was to have appeared here today as part of his delegation but who had been unable to be present: • \"I believe that, these extra- terrestrial vehicles and their crews are visiting this planet from other planets, which obviously are a little more technically advanced than we are here on earth. I feel that we need to have a top level, co-ordinated program to scientifically collect and analyze data from all over the earth concerning any type of encounter, and to determine how best to interface with these visitors in a friendly fashion. We may first have to show them that we have learned to resolve our problems by peaceful means, rather than warfare, before we are accepted as fully qualified universal team members. This acceptance would have tremendous possibilities of advancing our world in all areas. Certainly then it would seem that the United Nations has a vested interest in handling this subject properly and expeditiously... .1 did have occasion in 1951 to have two days of observation of many flights of them, of different sizes, flying in fighter formation, generally from east to west over Europe.

They read: SPACE VISITORS IN EASTERN CAPE. The story' gave details of a humanoid sighting in the Groendal Reserve not far from Uitenhage in the Eastern Cape of South Africa. I arrived in Uitenhage just before 5 PM on the 25th October, 1978, and went straight to the police station. However, when I learned that the Reserve was 20 kms from Uitenhage, I decided to check into an hotel in Port Elizabeth for the night and pursue the matter in the morning. Before leaving Uitenhage, I got onto the phone to the Warden of the Reserve, Mr. D.P. Zeelie, as I thought he would be able to give me information about the Reserve. To my surprise, the girl who answered the phone would not let me speak to him; she said that Zeelie had been instructed by his Department to talk to no one else about the sighting. I have been unable to obtain a reason for this. The following morning I contacted Keith Ross of the Week-End Post. Previously skeptical, he was now puzzled by what was going on. He invited me to his office and we had a long chat when several reporters and photographers gathered around, so I was able to give them a lot of information about UFOs, a subject about which they seemed patently ignorant. The story concerned the sighting by four young boys of three \"silver men\" in the Groendal Reserve, and the subsequent discovery of what-could have been a landing site by Keith Ross and members of the South African Police. It was obvious that I would have to start with the boys who had witnessed the \"silver men,\" and 1 made my way immediately to Despatch, about 5 kms from Uitenhage, where the boys all lived. Four young school-boys had been involved. Peter Simpson, 16; tall, pale and fair, a Standard 9A student. Jannie Bezuidenhout, 15; (continued on next page) (UN, Continued) (astronauts) who do believe in UFOs and who have had occasion to see a UFO on the ground, or from an airplane. There was only one occasion from space which may have been a UFO If the United Nations agrees to pursue this subject, and to lend their credibility to it, perhaps many more well qualified people will agree to step forth and provide help and information.\" (UN Press Release GA/AH/1479,27 November 1978) Mr. Hynek (Grenada) said that the scope and extent of the phenomenon of unidentified flying objects was not generally recognized. It was a phenomenon so strange and foreign to man's terrestrial mode of thought that it was frequently ridiculed by persons and organizations unacquainted with the facts. Contrary to the expectations of many, the phenomenon had persisted and had touched the lives of an increasing number of people throughout the world A surprisingly large number of individual scientists had expressed to him in private their involved concern with the challenge of the UFO phenomenon. . . .No intergovernmental or nongovern- mental organization existed to enable such persons to pool the results of theii research. All that was needed was a The Special Political Committee decided by consensus this morning to recommend to the General Assembly that it invite interested Member States \"to take appropriate steps to co- ordinate, on a national level, scientific research and investigation into extra- terrestrial life, including unidentified flying objects.\" - United Nations press release, December 3. 1978 mechanism whereby such interchange could be accomplished...

Hugo Ferreira, 12; small in stature but with a quick laugh and sparkling eyes. Joe Perino, 13; the quietest of the four. Peter is the son of Doctor and Mrs. Simpson. He is a practicing General Practitioner in Despatch. All the boys were Afrikaans speaking but Peter was the one most fluent in English. It was for this reason that I addressed most of the questions to him. Monday, 2nd October, 1978, was a holiday for the boys. The day was overcast but fine. The boys had gone off to the Groendal Reserve on a hike. Groendal Reserve is a wild nature reserve and equidistant from Uitenhage and Despatch. It is an isolated area of hills and valleys, heavily wooded with what the South Africans call 'fynbos' (finebush). Many animals abound there, ranging from small 'dassies' (rock-rabbits/hydrax) to baboons and leopard. The area is overseen by the warden, Mr. D.P. Zeelie. The boys arranged . for Mrs. Simpson to pick them up at 12 o'clock midday at the site of a stone monument. Here the ground is fairly clear of bush and scrub and isolated trees offer shade in the heat of the day! The gravel road to the Reserve also stopped at this point and although the road is not a good one, rutted in places and almost closed in by foliage in others, it does allow accessibility to the area. The boys were tired after their walk and at approximately 11:15 AM, they were seated on the ground at the monument, under the shade of a large tree waiting for their lift: Silver People Peter Simpson says, \"We all four of us saw this silver thing glisten between the trees on the side opposite to us. I thought it was a large stone shining in the sun. It was in the Strydomsberg direction and to the left of where we were.\" At almost the same moment, Jannie Bezuidenhout pointed to a spot about 275 meters to the west of the glistening stone. \"I saw two silver people standing there,\" he said. (He actually used the word \"monsters\" in Afrikaans in his statement, but Lfeel this Jannie Bezuidenhout points to route followed by (Port Elizabeth Week-End Post) 'Silver Men\" was suggested at a later date and was not his impression at the time.) Peter was aware of the men at almost the same time. \"Who did you think they were?\" I asked. \"In the beginning they looked just like ordinary.men and we thought they were poachers. But then we could see they wore silver suits like firefighters.\" Hugo Ferreira said, \"I thought their silver suits looked like aluminum foil.\"; Peter added, \"What struck me was that their clothes shone so brightly. They were completely silver and I couldn't see any face at all. There were two men at first and they were moving in a strange way. They didn't have any noticeable walking movement, and it looked as though they were gliding over the surface.\" Hugo Ferreira and Joe Perino agreed about the movement. Both voiced the opinion that the men appeared to be moving on trolleys. Peter said, \"The two men came from the direction of the glistening object. When they were in the middle of the hill, they were joined by a third man who was carrying a silver square (continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"suitcase. I do not know where the third man came from; he just suddenly appeared.\" \"Did you see a handle on the suitcase?\" I asked. \"No,\" Peter said, \"We didn't see any arms, either, but the suitcase was a bit behind the man who was carrying it.\" \"Was it attached to his body?\" \"No, it wasn't attached. But I don't know how he was holding it.\" All the boys agreed on this point. None of the witnesses could detect any arms. Jannie Bezuidenhout says in his statement that he did not notice any legs either, and from the drawings made by the boys, only Hugo Ferreira and Peter Simpson show any separation where the legs are. I asked, \"Did they appear like robots as opposed to normal men?\" \"No,\" Peter said. \"They were like normal men.\" \"And yet you say their movements were strange?\" \"Yes. They only moved from the knees downwards. It was almost like a fin.\" The boys watched the men come to a fence (marked on the photograph by the turning point in the tracks). \"They climbed over the fence and the one at the back looked in our direction. It seemed as though he stopped, waiting for the other two to go through the fence and then he looked at us. I could see then that the silver suit he wore came down over his forehead and then where his face was, that was grey.\" \"Do you think he saw you?\" I asked. \"Yes.\" \"Did you try and communicate in any way; like waving at them?\" \"No,\" Peter said. \"Did it strike you at the time that they might be people from another planet?\" \"Only when they had gone,\" Peter admitted. \"Have you read any books about UFOs, or seen any movies about them, like Close Encounters of the Third Kind?\" I asked. All the boys said that they had not read any UFO books nor seen any UFO movies. I asked Peter what his Apparent landing area in thick bush (Port Elizabeth Week-End Post) interests at school were and he told me \"History.\" \"What did you think about it all at the time?\" I queried. \"I didn't think of anything,\" Peter said. \"We all just looked.\" \"Were you talking among yourselves?\" \"No.\" During my conversation later with Mrs. Simpson, Peter's mother, she told me that Peter admitted to her afterwards that during the sighting he felt completely disorientated, as though he was quite alone there on the hill, with no one else about. When we discussed this in front of the other three boys, they admitted that they too had had a \"peculiar\" feeling, but reluctantly, I felt I should discount this claim to a \"joint feeling\" as it only came to light after general discussion. \"What was your reaction after you had seen the men?\" I asked. \"We were excited. We decided to leave the stone monument and move along to Mr. Zeelie's house and wait there for my mother.\" \"After the men went over the fence, what happened?\" I asked. Peter said, \"They moved along the fence towards the top of the hill and then they disappeared.\" \"Did they go over the top of the hill?\" \"No, they just suddenly disappeared,\" Peter said. Hugo Ferreira in his statement, says that when the men \"disappeared,\" the round thing had also gone. Jannie Bezuidenhout says, \"They walked up the hill alongside the fence until they disappeared,\" a statement reiterated by Joe Perino. Peter Simpson noted two further items of interest which pointed to the strangeness of the \"men\" involved. As they walked up the hill, which is fairly steep (as per photograph) they did not bend forward as a normal man would do, they remained upright. When I spoke to Mrs. Simpson, she said, \"Peter thought a normal human being and a fit man at that, would take at least 10 minutes to get up the hill.\" She added, \"I looked at it and I thought it would take me a jolly sight longer.\" This follows on to the next interesting point that the entire sighting, according to Peter Simpson and verified by the other boys, took .from 50 to 60 seconds only, although a fairly large area was covered. Despite Mrs. Simpson's words, I still feel that even she is underestimating the (Continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"(S. Africa, Continued) distance travelled by the beings. \"Something Out of the Ordinary\" When the men disappeared, the four boys spoke excitedly among themselves. They realized by then that they had witnessed something out .of the ordinary and they decided that instead of waiting for Mrs. Simpson to collect them at the monument, they would carry on along the gravel road to the Warden's house. Mrs. Simpson took up the story from there. \"The arrangement was that I would pick up the boys at the Big Stone at 12 o'clock, but I was a bit late and arrived at Mr. Zeelie's house at 12:05. I was very surprised to see the boys sitting outside Mr. Zeelie's house, next to the garage.\" Mrs. Simpson continued, \"I stopped the car and the four of them came running and the one was jabbering faster than the other. I told them to calm down and tell me what happened. I thought perhaps they had seen a baboon or a leopard on their walk from the Big Stone. But I could see they were highly excited and very agitated. And then Peter told me that they had seen three silver men. I questioned him and he said they appeared to be like normal human beings, adult size. I asked him if he had told Mr. Zeelie and he said he hadn't for fear of being laughed at. The other three also didn't want me to go to Mr. Zeelie because they said it seemed such a far-fetched story. \"None of them ever thought of a UFO or people from outer space. I certainly' didn't think of it then! But I was taken aback when the boys explained what these people's movements were like and then I immediately thought of people from outer space. But I didn't mention what my thoughts were. I said, 'Let's go and tell Mr. Zeelie' and Peter said 'Please Mom, he's going to laugh at us; this is top far-fetched.\" \" \"Peter said that at first he had thought they were poachers, but he changed his mind very quickly when he noticed their strange movements. At the same time, he wondered whether they could be fire-fighters or these people who go into the veld and eradicate the wild cactus plants. And then Peter told me that he didn't think they could be that because a normal human being couldn't move the way they did. What struck me so forcibly and made me think it was something alien was when Peter said, 'Mom, it's uphill and a normal human being would bend forward and no human could go uphill at . such a rate.' So I said, 'Come on, we're going to Mr. Zeelie.' \"We went to his office and he came out and we told him. He was a bit skeptical; he looked as though there was something, but he didn't mention it to us. I got the 8 *^S&7^ar.'*Wf : *X\\tf .iLii .!•»*? .£• Imprints in the ground within one of the impressions (Port Elizabeth Week-End Post) , impression that he believed the boys but that he was playing it cool. Subsequently, I heard that he had seen green lights on previous occasions over the Reserve. , \"I said to Peter, 'Are you sure they're not fire-fighters or poachers or anything like that? 1 And he said to me, 'Besides the fact that their clothing looked like tinsel' : — that was the word he used — 'their movements were so strange and awful ...it seemed to me as though they were on trolleys.' Joe Perino also told me that they looked as though they were gliding. \"I drove back to the stone immediately afterwards, to the parking area. I stopped and got out of the car. It looked very steep up that hill with low grass. I was taken aback afterwards when I heard that the hill was covered with bush over 2 meters tall. I don't think I would have bothered about the whole thing except that Peter said their movements were so strange and that they were moving uphill in an upright position, and at a terrific speed. I thought the sighting was about 200 meters from the boys. (This is a conservative estimate. /— Author) The distance they walked was from east to west and then south to north and the total length was about 200 meters. (According to Sgt. Powell of the South African Police, it was much further than this. — Author) It all happened on Monday, 2nd October, which was a holiday.\" I asked the boys if they had felt any ill effects. Mrs. Simpson said, \"Peter has been complaining of headaches this last week but he was not ill immediately afterwards.\" Mrs. Simpson also added, \"Peter told me that when these men reached the barrier (the fence) they couldn't make out if they glided over or climbed through as they couldn't see the fence clearly. When this man turned back and looked at them, his face had a sheen to it.\" When they arrived home after the incident, Mrs. Simpson wanted to notify the police and the press but her husband was against it. It was for this reason that the report of the story was delayed. It took Mrs. Simpson some days to persuade her husband to allow her to report the story and only after the boys had persisted with their experience. Eventually, Mrs. Simpson contacted Keith Ross of the Port Elizabeth Week-End Post and he came out immediately to check the story. Imprints At about the same time as the boys made their sighting, Groendal Reserve Forestry workers, Alfred Pope, Cedric Kaptein, and William Five came across strange footprints about 2 kms from where the boys had sighted the silver figures. The prints were oval shaped -and about 18 cms long. I was subsequently at this spot and frankly, although I am quite sure the trackers were correct in saying that the prints were neither animal nor human, it did not seem conceivable to me that the (continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"(S. Africa, Continued) prints of the silver men would be found in a spot as remote from the original sighting as this. When I examined the spot, which Christopher Powell pointed out to me, the imprints were no longer to be seen. Keith Ross, Sergeant Christopher Powell, and Major Gillamie of the South African Police, together with two trackers from the Reserve, decided to explore the area where the boys had first witnessed the \"glistening stone.\" To their surprise, they found the hill opposite to the boys and where the sighting took place, and which at first glance appeared to be merely grassed over, was in actual fact covered with \"fynbos\" over 2 meters high, and almost inaccessible. The terrain was so rough that it was not easily transgressed and it took the men approximately 1% hours to reach the spot. Soon after their arrival in the approximate area, they came across a fairly large depressed area. Unfortunately, it was now some time (about 16 days) after the sighting and there had been some heavy rain in the area. It appeared as though something heavy had rested here, flattening the grass and small trees. According to Sgt. Powell, there were 8 marks on the outside perimeter of the oval shape, each of the marks containing three fairly deep indentations. There were also four other marks within the oval, seemingly not related to the eight outside marks which were equidistant from one another. There was no evidence of burn marks on the bushes immediately surrounding the area. Unfortunately, none of the men involved in this first examination were aware that they should have taken soil samples or used a Geiger counter. \"In any case,\" said Keith Ross, \"I think much of value would already have been lost by this time due to the rains.\" The area was also trampled by the men which must have negated any further evidence which might have been found there. However, Evert-Smith of the Week-End Post took some fairly clear pictures of the area. Powell says, \"I cannot say for certain that this was the landing ground of the 'glistening object' the boys observed as it would have been G R A S S Y impressions in soil CLEARING ! 0 0.

Impressions e, f, g and h were poorly preserved, but also showed prong marks, 3 each in the case of g and h. Impression i lacked such holes and showed superficial compaction features which made it appear as if a flat surface had rested on the soil. There were no burn marks present and gciger counter readings showed no abnormal radioactivity.

Shone, Lecturer in Geology, 8 Nov. 1978. impossible to absolutely pinpoint the position. But there is no doubt in my mind that the depression was not formulated by anything normal. The marks were too symmetrical.\" The Groendal trackers concurred. It was certainly no known animal, although someone had suggested that it might have been turtles nesting in the area. \"Under no circumstances could any turtles have made marks so absolutely symmetrical and equidistant from one another,\" Christopher Powell told me. After interviewing the four boys and Mrs. Simpson, Peter and I, together with Sgt. Powell and two other people, drove to the Groendal Reserve. We were able to view the entire area covering the sighting from the stone monument, an area which was clear of bush and easily accessible. Peter told me that they knew this particular spot as \"Death Valley\" and I wasn't surprised. Towards dusk, as it was then, there was a certain atmosphere about the place. In the distance, we could hear baboons barking, and muted animal noises could be heard on the evening air. But there was a strange quietness about the place, almost as though, momentarily, one was lost in time. If the men in silver were aliens, they couldn't have chosen a better place if they were searching for privacy and remoteness. We stopped briefly at Mr. Zeelie's house, and he came out to meet us. He seemed friendly and cooperative and I did not mention the abortive phone call. Zeelie told me that three months before he had seen a green light over the Reserve and he could not account for it normally. He also told us that on the Friday prior to the boys' sighting (29th September, 1978) an Indian woman living in the area had reported seeing a disc-shaped object take off from the Reserve.

This book goes far beyond simple stories about psychic events. It provides information on mind control, parapsychology, UFOs, and extraterrestrial life, as seen through the eyes of the Soviet scientists actually involved in the research. Whether one chooses to \"believe\" the many unusual areas of Soviet research is immaterial. The important fact is that recognized scientists like Zigel, Raikov, Katsatkin, and the others are involved. Closing our eyes to that fact is dangerous and shortsighted.. UFO researchers around the world have heard of Prof. Felix Zigel, a leading expert on Russian ufology; but many have wondered if he is just another UFO nut. Gris and Dick dispel any doubts about Zigel's integrity through their descriptions of his work at the Moscow Aviation Institute, his teachings of Russian Cosmonauts, and his writing of 28 books and some 250 articles on astronomy and cosmonautics. Zigel is obviously Russia's equivalent of our Dr. J. Allen Hynek. Americans, with their nearly complete freedom to examine any area of science, often fail to appreciate how hard it is for civilian UFO researchers to operate in countries such as Russia. Gris and Dick give a brilliant insight into the extreme measures that must be taken just to survive in that environment. One such means is the use of a \"cover\" for their operations like the Club of Fantasts. The UFO reports exchanged through the club include such classics as a landed disc complete with trace evidence, sightings by atmospheric physicists, and the Russian UFO flap of 1968. Obviously, the UFO phenomenon is as bizarre in Russia as in the West. By combining William Dick's interest in the frontiers of science with Henry Gris' knowledge of Russia, The New Soviet Psychic Discoveries gives a glimpse of the future through vivid descriptions of sight-by-touch, telekinesis, UFO operations, and the exploration and mapping of the human brain. This book is the most significant treatise on the frontiers of Soviet science to be published in the past decade. It contains valuable clues on the Russian state-of-the-art in a number of fields and is recommended reading for all who are searching for truth.-- John F. Schuessler, Deputy Director of MUFON. (S. Africa, Continued) would assist me. My first contact was with Professor Rust of the Geology Department. On the phone, when I asked for an appointment, he was completely skeptical of UFOs and also informed me that his students were very busy with their year-end exams and he didn't know if he could find the time for a discussion. \"Just allow me five minutes of your time?\" I begged. In the end, he agreed to a brief interview at 12 o'clock. When I arrived there, one of the students obligingly showed me to the Professor's office. Rust is a dark, handsome man, but obviously had little time for stories about UFOs. I showed him the picture of the depressed area provided by the Week-End Post and he was obviously intrigued. At first I thought he might go along to the area himself, but he called in one of his lecturers, Russel Shone, and introduced us. I arranged with Shone, together with one of the, students perhaps, to go along with 10 Christopher Powell and survey the depressed area. Unfortunately, I couldn't stay on in Port Elizabeth indefinitely, and had to move on to Cape Town. I spoke to Christopher Powell, however, on several occasions. The men eventually made the trip to the area on Tuesday, 31st October, 1978, 29 days after the actual sighting. Russel Shone and a colleague of his, Dave Glenister, went along on the trip with Powell and the two geologists produced an extensive report. In a personal letter to me, Shone says: Unfortunately, the impressions were not at all clear when we visited the site. However, they are symmetrically distributed and this alone makes them interesting. From the site, I would guess that the object spotted by the boys must have been about 6 meters high in order to correspond with then- account. I am not in a position to comment on the possible mode of origin of the marks. However, if a hoax is involved, then there can be no doubt that the hoaxer is imbued with a certain amount of ingenuity and a large resource of energy. Naturally, as with most UFO cases, there are many questions still to be asked and answered. In the official report, Russell Shone states: There were 9 separate impressions as far as could be discerned. These were arranged symmetrically. The distance between the marks were measured, using a steel tape and have been plotted. Four of the impressions were sub-oval in shape. There were 4 small holes within the impressions which could have been made with a tubular prong or tine. There was some evidence of compaction in the soil, especially in one impression which was best preserved. There were no bum marks and Geiger counter readings showed no abnormal radioactivity. The location of the site itself is in such dense bush that it is difficult to imagine that any equipment could have easily been transported through the thickets into the clearing. Taking all the evidence into account, particularly together with Shone's report, the reliability of the witnesses, and the details which I was personally able to obtain, I think we have a pretty authentic sighting and landing case here."},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"JETS CHASE RADAR UFOs IN JAPAN By Jun-Ichi Takanaski (MUFON Director for Japan) It is a very rare occurrence in Japan that a UFO is tracked on radar and a jet is scrambled to chase it. On the night of August 17,1978, it occurred in the easternmost part of Japan. According to the evening editions of various newspapers in Tokyo, the Mainichi, the Ybmiuri, the Sankei and the Tokyo, etc., dated August 18,1978, Air Staff Supervision Authorities of the Defense Department released the following news. Around 10:30 PM, radars of Air Self-Defense Corps Nemuro Radar Site picked up an unidentified aerial object, which was flying from north to south- southwest at a slow speed of about 70 kms per hour at a low altitude of about 900 to 1,800 meters over Nemuro Channel, south of Kunashiri Island, approaching the eastern end of Hokkaido. It was later picked up by the radars of another radar site at Erimo- misaki, too. By order of Air Self-Defense Corps Misawa Base, two F4EJ Phantom jet interceptors were scrambled from Chitose Base about 10 minutes later, and guided by the instructions from both radar sites, searched for the target in the vicinity of Nakashibetsu (slightly SW of Shibetsu) where radars had picked up the object, but strangely enough, the airborne radars showed no target on their screen, and although it was a moon-lit clear night, pilots of both jets could not recognize any flying object which corresponded to the target on the radar screen in the radar sites. (One news report explains it as the result of different frequency of the airborne radars, but we doubt it.) The two jets returned to the base without result, but the strange object persisted in the area, proceeding southward, approaching Kushiro, and was twice picked up by ground radars at 11:23 and 12:13 PM, and on each (continued on next page) DAILY PRESS, Ashland, WI - NOT. 14, 1978 CR: R. Heiden Close encounters of the Latin kind BUENOS AIRES. Argentina (API Carlos Acevedo and Angel Moya told it this way: It was 4:30a.m., Sept. 23, and they were on the flat pampas south of Buenos Aires, stragglers on the final leg of a 39-day stock car race. Suddenly they noticed a yellow and violet light shining in their rear-view mirror. It approached too fast to be a com- petitor. Then a strange force shut off the engine and headlights of their Citroen CG. lifted it K feet off the road, then set it down a minute later and 75 miles north. The force also drained the car's gasoline lank. That's the way Carlos Acevedo and Angel Moya told it. Businessman Alejandro Hernandez recalled it like this: Driving in southern Chile on Sept. 24. he spotted a huge saucer overhead. The saucer havered over his car and swallowed it. Inside, he said, five bulky figures stuffed his l>-year-old son into a box while a sizth interviewed Hernandez in a metallk voice. Witnesses reported watching the car, with frightened father and son inside, descend to the road afterward. A month earlier, bank manager Serrano Silva reported a flying object butted his car on the highwar between Tunja and Bogota. Colombia. The car's engine and headlights died, and the banker said he and his passenger, a navy officer, suffered temporary paralysis. In a region fascinated by strange oc- curences, these stories nude from page headlines and the cover of a serious news magazine According to an Associated Press sur- vey, such UFO yams get frequent and widespread public attention in Argentina, Chile. Peru. .Brazil. Uruguay and Colombia In.Grenada, UFOs are a personal con- cern of Prime Minister Enc Gairy, who had them put on the Caribbean island's postage stamps. Reports of UFO sightings even draw crowds. For instance, travelers gathered at Chilca on the Pan American Highway in Peru to gaze at the sky where a squadron of 30 to 40 flying saucers was recently I cum led. Hundreds invited by radio to meet an outer space visitor drove to Chile's Tenglo Island one night in September, only to learn the whole thing was a hoax Here in Argentina - which leads the world in UFO sightings, according to a NASA tally - extraterrestrial visitors are part of the national folklore, thanks la dozens of such wellpublicized tale* ax these: —Six fishermen in San Luis Province last Feb 4 saw a saucer light up the predawn sky A towering (igure in a silver jumpsuit climbed down a ladder, waved, returned to the saucer and sped away.

Argentina's highly literate population seems ready for the \"invasion.\" Books like \"Chariot of the Gods\" and \"The History of Flying Saucers in Argentina\" have sold briskly, and a 424-page textbook on \"Extraterrestrial Science\" a being of- fered to Argentine secondary schools. The movie \"Close Ecounters of the Thin). Kind\" just ended a profitable 15-week run here. \"When people continuously contemplate such films, television shows, magazines and books, then UFOs, flying saucers and green men become so natural that finally the>' are perceived in the world that sur- rounds us,\" wrote Gregorio Klimovsky in a special section of the Buenos Aires newspaper Clarin analyzing the UFO phe- nomenon. Vlado Kapetanovich, a Peruvian engineer who says he met spacemen while building a dam. put himself under psy- chiatric analysis to dispel his own doubts before writing a book about the encounter. When it was published his daughter had him committed toanasylum, but he talked his way out and his book became a best seller in Peru. Grenada Prime Minister Gairy has a harder time with skeptics. His recent demand for a U N investigation of UFOs was ridiculed by the island's newspapers. One cartoon showed him on a mountain gazing at flying saucers while his people suffered in squalor below. While Yaqui Indians in northeast Mexico curse extraterrestrial intruders for their woes, most Latin believers say the \"visitors\" are benevolent explorers or peacemakers. Sergio Lemos. a Rio de Janeiro schoolteacher, says he was told by a \"UFO Commander Akilovan\" that his mission was to prevent nuclear holocaust \"They have vested interest in averting a nuclear war on earth, as this would blow the planet apart and alter the cosmos,\" said-Ariel Rietti, head of Argentina's UFO Observatory Commission. \"They .have come here to see how their security It related to our stupidity.\" 11"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"CORRECT COLOR COMMUNICATIONS By P. Wayne LaPortc (Tarheel UFO Study Group) Communication of color by the witness to the investigator and by the investigator to the central headquarters is often a problem. Two relatively inexpensive tools can be used. One is a Color Visualizer Chart on the back cover of the Color Wheel Kit put out by M. Grumbacher, Inc., 460 West 34th Street, New York, N.Y. 10001. This is No. B425 and sells for about $5 in art stores. The second item is the Federal Standard No. 595a Color Catalog (see box). The Color Visualizer Chart is a matrix of 108 colors. Each column is a basic color: Violet, Blue-Violet, Blue, etc. There are 12 columns. The mid- row is the pure color. Above this row are 4 rows progressively lighter in shade. Below are 4 rows progressively darker. Assign O to the row of pure color. Now assign a -1, -2, -3, and -4 to progressively lighter rows as you move to top of chart. Likewise, assign 1,2,3, and 4 to rows moving toward bottom of chart. Use the Color Visualizer Chart. Label color on drawing by witness. Use first initial of color. For example, use BV for Blue-Violet. Behind, write pure color or shade number (-4, -3, -2, -1,0,1, 2, 3, 4). Then further identify color by using Federal Standard Number from Color Catalog. Use FS followed by appropriate number of color selected by witness. PROPOSAL FOR ESTABLISHING A STANDARD COLOR REFERENCE SYSTEM VIA USE OF THE FEDERAL STANDARD COLOR CATALOG One problem I have encountered during investigations is communication of color. The color must be communicated by the witness to the investigator, and by the investigator to the central headquarters. I have used an artist color wheel and a paint company paint catalog. The color wheel has too few colors. The paint catalog has too many. Also, central headquarters must have the same brand color wheel or paint catalog. A better system is to use the Federal Standard No. 595a Color Catalog. This is a 31-page catalog with about 650 % inch by 1 inch color chips. The colors are broken down into BROWNS, REDS, ORANGES, YELLOWS, GREENS, BLUES, GREYS, AND MISCELLANEOUS. Each color chip has a number. The number allows for quick location of colors. If the witness says he saw a red nocturnal light, have him look through the REDS. There are twenty-four reds. Note Red and then the federal standard number. Then, anyone having an FS 595a catalog can see basically what color the witness saw. The catalog is furnished in loose-leaf form to permit the insertion of new material. It can be obtained for $2.75 from GSA Specifications, Washington Navy Yard Building 197, Washington, D.C. 20407. Delivery - 3 weeks.

But, strangely enough again, when the jets approached the target, it disappeared from the radar screen. Finally the target disappeared from the radar screens of both radar sites. The Air Staff Supervision Authorities' opinion on the nature of the target differs slightly between the 12 news Reports of various newspapers. According to the Tokyo Shinbun, as the clear target was caught on the screen, Air Staff Supervision Authorities think it certain that some Sap] object was flying at the time, but they think from the speed, etc., that it may have been an ad balloon, or a flock of migrating birds.

Schuessler During the month of June 1974, a fisherman was operating his boat on the Little River near Georgetown, La., when he came upon a metallic disc partially buried in a sandbar. Recognizing immediately that it was strange to that environment he decided to retrieve it. Using his boat oar as a shovel he dug away the sand and obtained a circular piece of metal 38 inches in diameter, 1/8 inch thick, with a 14-inch hole in the middle. The donut- shaped artifact was discolored on one side as if it had been very hot. The heating had caused that side to melt. As it did, subtle shades of many colors formed abstract patterns across the bubbled surface, along nodules, and on ragged edges. The pattern of molten metal seemed to swirl as if it had been spun while hot. Close examination of the metal revealed some of its properties. It was extremely hard, tough and rigid. The non-molten side was the color of stainless steel. The artifact was actually beautiful, like a piece of abstract art. The discoverer felt that he had found a piece of a \"flying saucer,\" as there had been sightings in that area during the flap of 1973. Eventually, the artifact was obtained by David Kissinger of PROJECT VISIT in Houston and the identification process began. Since the material appeared to be of the type used in spacecraft construction, it was taken to the Materials Section of the Johnson Space Center, where it was immediately recognized as a dome from one of the Apollo Service Module storage tanks. It was titanium. This was not the first piece of material that had survived the intense heating of reentry from space. If the \"experts\" had not been available this piece of material may have required a number of tests before an identification was made. This situation is not uncommon. Many UFO investigators have been faced with the decision of what to do about artifacts of all sizes and shapes. The metalworking industry faces such decisions on a daily basis. Metals being stored for future use often turn up without identification tags. The Defense Supply Agency of the Department of Defense (DOD) has identified a number of tests that may be used to identify the unknown metals. These range from a simple color examination, to spark testing, to wet chemical, and finally to spectrographic methods. Of course, the spectro- graphic technique is the one to use for a high level of accuracy and detail in the analysis. However, the one drawback is expense — it is costly and quite possibly not necessary. In a great many cases, three simple tests — magnetic, spark, and chemical spot — will supply enough information to identify it, or at least assign it to a particular family group. The process should start with an examination for color. According to Iron Age magazine, red represents copper; tan for cupro- nickel; dark yellow for bronzes; light yellow for brasses; dark grey for zinc and lead; and white or gray for most other metals. Next, a magnetic test will reveal iron, steel, nickel, and the 400- series stainless steels to be strongly magnetic. Monel, aluminum bronze, and cupro-nickel are slightly magnetic. Most others are non-magnetic. An experienced metal handler can tell a lot by the spark test — a process of holding the metal to a grinding wheel and observing the spark stream. Characteristics of interest are <the length of the stream, the color, and number of carbon star bursts. Chemical tests provide the next level of sophistication. Chemical tests may be very simple spot tests involving just a few chemicals; others may be more complex. The chemicals aid in determining the presence or absence of certain identifying alloying elements. They do this by forming precipitates or producing the colors that are characteristic of the unknown elements. The Defense Supply Agency has developed a set of sequential charts to break down the identification process to very specific alloys. In addition, the American Society for Testing and Materials publishes detailed procedures for the wet chemistry techniques. All this is just the beginning of a very complex field, but one that is most valuable to the UFO investigator. A final word of caution — take care not to contaminate or destroy any UFO evidence. At the same time it pays to at least understand the process of metals identification, a process only briefly touched on in this tech note.

DcGraw (Reprinted by permission from The UFO Examiner, Vol. 2, No. 3, September 1978, Route #1,' Hazelton, IA 50641. Editor Ralph DeGraw notes that there are discrepancies between the witness descriptions and with the original account by Lonnie Zamora, but in broad detail the testimony appears to support Zamora's report-Editor) Most readers are familiar with the famous Socorro, New Mexico landing case which occurred about 5:45 P.M. on Friday, April 24, 1964. Socorro Police Officer, Lonnie Zamora, was chasing a speeding motorist south of town, when his attention was drawn to a flame in the sky and a roar approximately one-half to one mile to the southwest. Thinking that a dynamite shack which was located in that area had blown up, Zamora decided to discontinue pursuit of the speeder and investigate. The flame descended into a shallow gully beyond a hill as Zamora, with some difficulty, attempted to reach the area on a rough road which led in that direction. After three attempts, Zamora reached the top of the hill and after looking around a short time, suddenly noticed an egg-shaped object, white in color like \"aluminum\", sitting on the ground in a shallow gully off the road. Near the object were two small figures dressed in white coveralls. One of them seemed startled as it seemed to turn and look directly at Zamora's car. Zamora, thinking that there had been an accident, as the object somewhat resembled an over-turned car, continued toward the object, paying attention to the rough road as he drove. When arriving at a point approximately 100 feet from the strange object, Officer Zamora noticed a strange insignia of some sort on the side of it. The insignia was red, about 2'/ 2 feet high and about 2 feet wide. Suddenly, Officer Zamora heard a loud roar and saw a light blue flame with 14 an orange bottom, coming from the underside of the object. The object then rose vertically (by this time Zamora was running for cover and looked at the object from over his shoulder), then moved off horizontally about 10 to 15 feet in the air. The object cleared the nearby dynamite shack by about 3 feet, heading in a southwest direction. The object seemed to get smaller as it seemed to slowly gain altitude and just cleared Box Canyon or Six Mile Canyon Mountain. It disappeared from view as it went over the mountains. Officer Zamora stated that when the object took off, there was no smoke, but dust was apparently stirred up in the immediate area. OTHER WITNESSES According to a local gas station attendant, Zamora's UFO was seen by at least one other witness. Opel Grinder, a Whiting Bros, gas station attendant, told Dr. J. Allen Hynek, who was investigating the case for the Air Force at the time, that an unidentified motorist had stopped at the station shortly before 6 P.M. and had mentioned seeing a strange craft that had flown low over Highway #85 as he drove North. Grinder told Dr. Hynek that the motorist reported the craft was headed West toward a mesa. After the object had disappeared behind the mesa, the motorist said he saw a patrol car (apparently Zamora's) driving up the mesa in the same direction that the strange craft had come down in. Attempts to locate this unidentified witness have been futile and to this day, he has never come forth to confirm Zamora's story. According to Ray Stanford's recent book \"Socorro Saucer in a Pentagon Pantry,\" two men from Dubuque, Iowa also witnessed Zamora's UFO while driving in that area at the same time. Stanford's only source of information, however, is a newspaper article which was published on Wednesday, April 29, 1964 by the Telegraph-Herald in Dubuque, Iowa. Mistakes abound in the article as to exact date, description of object, etc., and Stanford (having never personally talked with the two witnesses) has done a lot of speculating and assuming in order to make the two witnesses' story confirm that of Officer Zamora. We decided to contact these two witnesses to get the full story of their experience, and to confirm, if possible, that they had indeed seen the same object as Zamora. Interview dates were set up with the two men and on May 26th, Patrick Crowley and I interviewed Mr. Larry Kratzer at his apartment in Dubuque. On May llth, I interviewed Mr. Paul Kies at his home. Both men agreed to a tape-recorded interview and also filled out standard report forms. Both men remembered the sighting and recounted to the best of their knowledge, what had happened and what they had seen. More than 14 years has elapsed since the incident and both men found it difficult to recall every detail, but were able to recount the most important ones. When Crowley and I set out to investigate the two lowans' stories, we assumed that they would tell approximately the same story and give similar descriptions. However, we were very mistaken. Although the circumstances such as time, location, etc., were described the same by both men, descriptions of what they saw were entirely different! In order to accurately relay both mens' stories, I have decided to summarize each man's testimony separately, with my analysis at the end. (Analysis omitted here-Editor.) PAUL KIES' DESCRIPTION On Friday, April 24, 1964, Paul Kies and Larry Kratzer were returning to Dubuque, Iowa after picking up a boat which Kies had been forced to"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"leave behind near Quemado, N. Mexico on a previous trip, due to automobile difficulties. They had left Quemado earlier that day and were driving east on Highway #60. After crossing the Magdelenia Mountains they began their long descent towards the town of Socorro, which lay along the Rio Grande'. According to Kies, it was approximately 5:00 P.M. (Iowa time) or shortly before, when they reached a point approximately 1 mile southwest of Socorro. Suddenly Kratzer, who was driving, pointed out a cloud of dust followed by black smoke which appeared to be ahead and slightly to the right of their position. Kies estimated that it was about 1 mile distant and was coming from the ground. Then, as they watched, a bright, shiny \"reflection\" , appeared within the smoke. Kies stated that they continued on toward Socorro and that they moved at such an angle that. the \"reflection\" was no longer visible. Kies was not sure whether he had seen the reflection of sunlight (which was low in the western sky) falling on an object on the ground or whether the object itself was emitting light. However, at the time, he felt that there must have been a junk yard in that area and that someone was burning tires and cutting up wrecked cars, and that he had seen part of a car body or window reflecting the sun. He at no time thought anything about UFOs and certainly did not attribute his observation to one. Continuing on, Kies and Kratzer drove into Socorro, stopping at a filling station (Kies thinks it may have been a Chevron station), to hook-up the boat trailer lights which they had neglected to do earlier. Kies told us that he vaguely remembers Kratzer mentioning that he had told the station attendant about what they had seen, but does not remember him (Kratzer) saying anything about Zamora's sighting (see Kratzer's story to follow). After leaving the station, Kies and Kratzer continued on toward Iowa, traveling on Highway #60 until they reached Vaughn, N.M. Just east of Vaughn they turned off on Highway #54 which took them through the panhandles of Texas and Oklahoma and on to Wichita. While driving through the Texas/Oklahoma panhandle they heard a news report on the car radio which made them think twice about what they had seen earlier near Socorro. Kies said they were listening to Oklahoma City radio station KOMA during one of the stations brief news reports sometime between shortly before 11 P.M. and Midnight, when the story of Zamora's UFO sighting came on. Kies stated that during the broadcast the radio station suddenly went off the air. By the time it came back on, the report on Zamora's encounter was over. However, Kies said they heard enough of the story to \"put- two and two together\" and decided that they must have seen the same object as Zamora, rather than a junk yard with burning tires. Too many things fit such as location, time, etc. After returning to Dubuque, Kies and Kratzer decided they should tell the local newspaper their story since the Zamora sighting was still making headlines. This they did but the newspaper didn't get the facts straight. The paper had the two men sighting the object on Saturday when in reality the incident had occurred on Friday. The paper also stated that they were a mile east of Socorro, where as Kies said they were definitely west of the town, heading east. LARRY KRATZER'S DESCRIPTION Since most of the above summary is consistent with Mr. Kratzer's account, I will describe only the inconsistencies between the accounts. Larry Krazer stated that he was driving Mr. Kies' car, a 1964 silver-blue Corvette, toward the town of Socorro, and when approximately one mile west of town, noticed a cloud of black smoke coming from the ground ahead of them and to the right. Kratzer brought this to Kies' attention and watched as a round, saucer or egg-shaped object ascended vertically from the black smoke. Kratzer told us that it was hard to estimate distances and altitudes, especially since the incident had happened so long ago, but roughly estimated that the object was about l / 2 to 1 mile distant and was at an altitude of roughly 1,000 ft. when first seen. After climbing vertically out of the smoke, Kratzer said the object leveled off and moved in a southwest direction, disappearing in the black smoke which he said was coming out of its underside. 'Kratzer described the object as a shiny silver in color with a row of round \"darker mirror-like windows\" or portholes across the side with a \"red Z\" .marking toward the right end of the object. He told us that he could see about four \"windows\" on the side facing him, but assumed that they went all the way around the craft. The object made no noise that he could hear and when asked what his impressions were at the time, he said that he thought it'was some vertical lift aircraft that the government was experimenting with. Kratzer said the object was about the size of the moon and that after it was concealed by the black smoke, the smoke got smaller as it traveled slowly out of view in the distance. Kratzer stated that while he and Kies were hooking up the boat trailer lights, he mentioned what he and Kies had seen to the attendant on duty. Kratzer said the attendant then told him that he had heard that a local policeman had seen a strange object on the edge of Socorro also, over the radio. Strange Lights' | Seen Over State - Are Unexplained ARDMORF fUPI) — Strange, blinking lights that changed colors flitted across the sky over southern Oklahoma and North Texas early Tuesday, and authorities said they were unable to explain the sightings. Several sightings were reported by police and other officers, and some by private citizens. \"At first, I thought it was a falling star, but it kept changing direct- ions,\" said dispatcher Mike Bracken of the Oklahoma Highway Patrol's Ardmore district headquarters.

The subject of \"candle balloons\" presents a great problem to UFO researchers in California. We are happy to publish Laporte's personal experience and advice.) The birthday candle balloon IFO contributes much to UFO \"noise.\" In order to become fully familiar with the appearance of these common pranks, UFO investigators would do well to construct and launch one. By seeing one themselves, researchers can better understand how witnesses can readily misidentify then as UFOs. Launching candle balloons is not a violation of FAA regulations, provided they are not launched within 3 miles of an airport. However, they may be in violation of local laws, so check with the local police authorities before launching any. (In the Southern California area, those investigators who have experimented with these ballopns have found it useful to tether them on the end of a long string, due to local danger of brush fires.— AD) CONSTRUCTION TECH- NIQUES: Three techniques are commonly used to fabricate these IFOs. All three methods use a plastic, shirt-size laundry bag, which is sealed at the hanger opening with scotch tape or with a hot iron. First Method: Scotch tape two soda straws end to end. Using two sets of straws, make a 90-degree cross and tape together. Trim straws so you have a 16-inch span. Using a hobby knife, make three % inch-long slots on each leg of cross. These slots should be one inch apart, starting one inch from the center. Melt the bottom of birthday candles and quickly insert in slots in the straws. Second Method: Use balsa strips 1/32 inch thick by 1/4 inch wide. Glue to form 90-degree cross with a 16-inch span. Melt bottoms of birthday candles and place on the balsa strips one inch apart. 16 By Wayne Laporte Third Method: Unbraid a copper electrical wire and make a 10-inch diameter loop. Fashion a cup of aluminum foil to hold a sterno pellet. Use four strands of copper wire about 6 inches long to hold the foil cup. Very fine wire must be used, or balloon will not rise above a few feet. In all cases, attach the plastic laundry bag to the 90-degree opening support by scotch tape. LAUNCH TECHNIQUE: Use a propane torch to blow up and heat the air in the balloon. Once the balloon puffs out, light the candles. Hold a small propane torch inside the balloon until the plastic feels warm to the touch. Then release the balloon. Successful launch requires two persons and low surface winds. High surface winds are apt to blow the plastic into the candle flames. Also allow at least 200 feet radius for balloon to clear nearby trees and buildings. Have a fire extinguisher on hand. OBSERVATION: Candle balloons rise quite rapidly. The candles can be seen and identified plainly at a lateral distance up to 100 feet. The plastic bag can be seen visually up to about 300 feet. If clear, transparent laundry bags are used, the typical color of a launched candle balloon is yellow-white. At about 600 feet, the light starts to look yellow- orange. At 800 feet, the balloon becomes medium orange. Tinted bags, such as green or blue, may cause a different color to be seen by witnesses on the ground. These balloons reach an altitude of 2,000 feet and last from 13 to 15 minutes. (In rare California cases, they have, been tracked for close to 20 minutes.—AD) The distance depends on wind velocity. Our best balloon traveled about 1% to 2 miles. At maximum altitude, candle balloons look like Venus or Jupiter in visual magnitude and size. MANEUVERS: Candle balloon behavior is completely dependent on the winds. They do not always drift in a straight path. Often their flight is erratic. In variable winds, they bob, dart about, and even appear to hover while caught between wind levels which travel in different directions. 1 These balloons \"go out\" in the following ways: 1. sudden extinguishing, with sometimes a small glow continuing for a few seconds; 2. the balloon flaring, momentarily, then going out; 3. the balloon catching fire as the bag and/or candle support catches fire (when this happens, it looks like a \"UFO\" burning out); 4. balloon appearing to drop \"balls of fire.\" This fourth aspect causes more UFO \"noise\" than the other three aspects. When the candles fall off, there can be anywhere from one to several flaming pieces dropping in succession. The balls fall fast and are visible for about a 50-foot drop. If the balloon is at maximum altitude, this is only a 2% drop of the distance from the IFO to the ground. Long elevation drops of candles are extremely unlikely because airflow extinguishes the burning candles as the velocity increases. This holds true also for burning pieces of plastic straws. Burning balsa debris will fall a long way. However this wood is light and floats slowly down. It will drift with the wind rather than fall vertically like the heavier burning candles. Sometimes \"balls of fire\" are seen being ejected from authentic UFOs, but"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"Lucius Farish In Others' Words The October 24 issue of NATIONAL ENQUIRER has a follow: up report on Carl Higdon, who claims to have been taken to another planet in a UFO. According to the story, hypnotic testimony and Psychological Stress Evaluation analyses confirm Higdon's allegations. The October 31 ENQUIRER issue reported on an Italian UFO incident from August 1977, in which a witness who attempted to approach the object was repelled by a violent force. The same issue contains a short item concerning the lack of official governmental plans for greeting (or defending against) possible space visitors. UFO activity over the Yakima Indian Reservation in Southern Washington is described in the November 7 issue, along with the results of a recent poll on the renewed spending of federal funds to investigate. UFOs. The majority of those polled (75%) opposed additional federal spending for UFO investigations. A UFO landing report from Rocha, Uruguay, is detailed in the November 14 ENQUIRER issue. The testimonies of UFO \"abductees\" are..the subject of comments by Drs. R. Leo Sprinkle, Alvin Lawson, W.C. McCall, and Kent Newman in an article for the November 7 issue of THE STAR. The December issue of FATE presents Philip Klass' negative view of the Coyne helicopter/UFO case which occurred over Ohio in October 1973. In a rejoinder to Klass' article, Jennie Zeidman shows the inadequacies of Klass' arguments in his attempt to find a \"conventional\" explanation for the incident. The #12 issue of TRUE FLYING SAUCERS & UFOs is composed almost entirely of rehash and non-UFO- related material. Some rather interesting sighting reports and photos from the New York City area are featured in the #2 issue of UFO UPDATE, but a goodly portion of this issue is also rehash. Ufologists whose involvement with the subject extends back to the late 195Q's may well remember ads for a \"Flying Saucers\" chart which appeared in magazines of that period. It was one of the relatively few attempts to provide a graphic display of UFO shapes, sizes, speeds, possible origins, maneuvers, etc. As such, it represented a tremendous amount of research on the part of the compiler, Fred Keziah. Readers may be interested in knowing that copies of the 1958 edition of the chart are still available at the original price of $1.00 each (plus postage).

This new edition — presumably hardcover — will sell for $24.00. (California Report, Continued) these differ in size, maneuvers and speed, as well as being longer-lived than the pieces which fall from candle balloons. Plastic candle balloons do not show up on radar. Those constructed with heavy wire or hanging strips of tinfoil can cause a weak radar return, but these balloons have almost no lifting power. They .cannot lift and drop railroad flares, such as Phil Klass claims in his book UFOs EXPLAINED. Flare balloons, usually construct- ed with lighter-than-air gases, are quite another matter, and more uncommon than our old nemesis, the candle balloon.

Grenada, by itself, cannot apply sufficient influence to launch a full-scale study, but the submission of UFO material and sincere interest by several of the major powers of our world would have the necessary impact to \"get the ball rolling\". MUFON, as an international UFO organization, has members in most nations who should start immediately to cultivate the interest and submit solid cases to their governments that may be transmitted to the Secretary-General as evidence of support to Grenada's proposal. Success in such a mission would be another giant stride in resolving the UFO phenomenon. Here is your opportunity to take positive steps. MUFON is indebted to Peter Tomikawa, a Japanese citizen residing in Yonkers, N.Y., who has been our special envoy to the United Nations, providing copies of all UN material related to UFOs and for photographs taken on November 27, 1978, at the Special Political Committee meeting and news conference where presentations were made by Dr. J. Allen Hynek, Dr. Jacques Vallee, Stanton T. Friedman, Lt. Col. Larry Coyne, Sir Eric Gairy, and Dr. Wellington Friday. Lee Spiegel attended the news conference and was the visual aids coordinator for the presentation to the UN. As previously announced in the Journal, the world's first postage stamps commemorating UFO research have been issued by the Caribbean island nation of Grenada. The 35C stamp pictures a radar antenna probing the skies, and six infrared spots, which could be UFOs, around the moon. Grenada's five cent stamp shows a woodcut reproduction of an object said to have invaded the skies of Nuremberg, Germany, on April 15, 1561. Also on the stamp is an illustration of a flying saucer as described by George Adamski. The three dollar stamp depicts a simulated flying saucer on the left, next to a picture of a strange light photographed over Bells, Texas, during the 1965 flap by Bob Campbell. (It was rotated 90 degrees in error on the stamp). 18 A special philatelic issue . commemorating the 32nd Regular Session of the General Assembly of the United Nations dated October 7,1977, is titled \"Quest to Discover More About U.F.O.'s and Related Phenomena.\" It measures approximately 3 l / 2 by 4% inches in size depicting the United Nations building complex in New York City. A two dollar stamp picturing Sir Eric Gairy and the UN Assembly Hall in perforated stamp size composes the center of the special issue. A simulated UFO appears over Manhattan Island with the inscription \"Research Into U.F.O.'s.\" All four of these full color stamps may be obtained from the postal service in Grenada or your recognized stamp dealers. (The $3 stamp is worth a little more than one dollar in U.S. currency.) Tom Adams, State Section Director for Lamar, Red River, Franklin, and Titus counties in Texas, has become very involved in the past few years in the mystery surrounding the cattle mutilations. He has produced four issues of STIGMATA, the Project Stigma Report on the Continuing Investigation into the Occurrence of Animal Mutilations. Project Stigma represents an on-going probe into the relentless wave of animal mutilations and mutilation-deaths, . and is an attempt to coordinate and assist in information gathering activities on the part of the pertinent and responsible investigative agencies and individuals. The.MUFON UFO Journal has not dedicated space to cattle mutilations, since the people behind these illegal .acts have not been definitely identified as cult organizations, UFOs, or possibly both. We feel that the work being done by Tom and his father has a place in this diversified quest for answers to the UFO phenomenon. To receive the \"Fall 1978 STIGMATA\" send $1.00 (cash preferred) to Project Stigma, P.O. Box 1094, Paris, Texas 75460. Tom's interest in this subject goes back to the \"Snippy the Horse Case\" in Alamosa, Colorado, in which he became involved. Frequently in the Director's Message I discuss MUFON activities, which could be titled \"News Around the Network.\" The Houston UFO group, identified as VISIT (Vehicle Internal Systems Investigative Team) holds monthly meetings. Meetings scheduled in the near future will be held March 4, 1979,6:00 PM at the home of Lawrence D.

Niemtzow, 1611 Ramada, Houston, TX, and the May 6th meeting is to be announced later. On November 30, 1979, an organizational meeting was held in San Antonio, Texas, to establish a UFO investigative team for Bexar County under the direction of Bill Dante, State Section Director. The following officers were elected: President-Wade McKinney, Vice President-Irene Immerman, Secretary-Evelyn Goodman, Treasurer-Kim L. Neidigh, Director of Investigations-Bob Morgan, UFO Hotline Operator-Arline McKinney, and Public Relations Director-Audrey Palulis. Since moving MUFON headquarters to Seguin, Texas, in July of 1975, organizing Bexar County has been one of my personal goals that is now becoming a reality in the United States' tenth largest city. Keith Basterfield, MUFON Representative in Australia, has recently compiled a close encounter catalog of Australian cases dating back to July 25, 1868, and up to March 5, 1978, composed of 52 pages, copyrighted July 1978. It is titled \"A Source Catalogue of Australian UFO and Related Reports.\" Keith would like to thank all the member organizations of the Australian Co-Ordination Section of the Center for UFO Studies, and especially Bill Chalker of Sydney for his work on physical trace cases. Both Keith and Bill Chalker responded very promptly on the October 21,1978, Frederick Valentich pilot and aircraft disappearance case.

Johnson, a freelance writer living in Orem, between Salt Lake and Provo. He rehashed some of Dr. Frank Salisbury's book, The Utah UFO Display, and threw in the history of the Tremonton films, but his lead was a new sighting that occurred on August 12 near Provo. Those who \"Ski Utah,\" if you'll pardon the plug, may know Robert Redford's Sundance resort. If you don't ski, you might recognize it as the scene of the winter cabin sequence of his film Jeremiah Johnson. Two Provo couples horseback riding in the area heard a loud crashing coming from the other side of a meadow where they had stopped to rest their horses. The horses were disturbed; one bolted and threw the rider. When it was quiet, they continued their ride and reaching the top of the ridge, they saw a large bright yellow object going down canyon at eye level, against prevailing canyon drafts. It reversed its course just before a small plane passed through the canyon, giving the observers an estimate of the size of the Unidentified, which was about the same size as the plane, a Cessna 172. When the riders reached the far side of the meadow, the spot where the object had apparently been causing the commotion, about two hours later, their horses broke uncontrollably for home. Deer were seen dashing at full speed across the meadow. The case is under investigation.

North Carolina is now planning for their third annual MUFON UFO Training Conference, to be announced at a later date. Some very interesting UFO reports are now emanating from New Zealand, starting on December 22, 1978, and culminating with motion pictures filmed from an aircraft that were shown on CBS-TV on January 1, 1979, in the United States. Harold Fulton, MUFON Director for New Zealand, has sent newspaper accounts for December 22,23, and 24, and Keith Basterfield has filed a preliminary report.

He is an experienced researcher and investigator with an A.B. in liberal arts plus 45 graduate credits. Bill Moore's interest in the events surrounding the so-called Philadelphia Experiment (U.S. Navy) stems from research begun in 1974 with the initial intention of exposing the entire story as nothing more than an elaborate hoax. The extensive investigation that followed, an investigation which led him to visit, some 25 states and two foreign countries and to log over 24,000 miles of travel soon served to convince him that the exact opposite was in fact the truth. His forthcoming book, \"The Philadelphia Experiment: Project ^Invisibility\" (Grosset & Dunlap, Spring '1979), done in consultation with well known author, linguist, and researcher Mr. Charles Berlitz, sets forth the results of that investigation in graphic detail.

An update on the proposals by the nation of Grenada to the United Nations regarding unidentified flying object may be summed up in the press release of December 8, 1978 by the Special Political Committee. The paper reads as follows: \"The Special Political Committee recommends to the General Assembly adoption of the following consensus: \"The General Assembly has taken note of the statements made, and draft resolutions submitted by Grenada at the 32nd and 33rd sessions of the General Assembly regarding unidentified flying objects and related phenomena. The General Assembly invites interested member States to take appropriate steps to co- ordinate on a national level scientific research and investigation into extraterrestrial life, including unidentified flying objects, and to inform the Secretary-General of the observations, research, and evaluation of such activities. The General Assembly requests the Secretary- General to transmit the statements of the delegation of Grenada and the • relevant documentation to the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space, so that they may consider them at their 1979 meeting. The Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space will permit Grenada, upon its request, to present their views to the Committee at its next session. The Committee's deliberation will be included in its report which will be considered by the General Assembly at its 34th session.\" The UN Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space will next meet in June 1979 and the United Nations will convene in September 1979.
