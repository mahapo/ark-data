FROM THE EDITOR As another year draws to a close it is once again the time for stock- taking. Has visible progress been made during 1981 toward increased understanding of UFOs and improved public education? We feel that it has, largely due to the excellent MUFON, CUFOS, and other public meetings or symposia and the vigorous activities of the Fund for UFO Research and Citizens Against UFO Secrecy, not to mention the parallel efforts of our overseas colleagues. A concerted effort by all concerned in 1982 could lead to important new breakthroughs: We commend to your attention the Open Letter from Massachusetts MUFON and the planned 1982 international meetings in conjunction with, the MUFON UFO Symposium in Toronto. We urge you to support one or more of the worthy UFO groups through contributions, subscriptions, purchases of documents, and volunteer help. We have to make it happen.

And this feeling came over me, 'Boy! You got no business here! There's something here and you better get out of here!' And I did.\" For 30 years Bill Vogel was the chief fire control officer on the Yakima Indian Reservation until his retirement in August 1980. For many years he has been an Associate with the Center for UFO Studies. There's something baffling, possibly frighten- ing, taking place in an isolated 3,500-square-mile expanse of Indian land in south-central Washington state, and Vogel, a quiet, reserved man, is patiently monitoring it. I sat down with Vogel one August Sunday afternoon in his house in Top- penish, which lies just inside the northeastern corner of the Reserva- tion. The sky was turning to hard, blue enamel outside the closed win- dows, and a cold pitcher of iced tea and an air conditioner greeted me in his study. As Vogel told the story, he had gone up the Oak Springs Road at 2:30 in the morning searching for an often- seen, bright, orange object that had ap- peared once again while he was on duty at the Indian Agency. He had radioed the fire lookout at Sopelia Lookout shortly before. Had she seen it? No. \"I had been down that road dozens of times because I like to get lightning pictures and that's the best place to do that. You-can go up there a mile or so, it's dark, you don't have any lights around, you can'sit there with your camera open for hours ...\" About a mile up the road, he stopped his pickup. The lookout radioed that she saw his lights. He shut them off. No orange light in sight. Then within 30 seconds he was seized by a feeling that he was not alone. He hightailed it back to the Agency without radioing the lookout that he was leaving. \"I had been there 20 or 25 minutes when the lookout called and said, 'Are you able to see anything?' I said, Tvlo, I didn't, I'm back at the Agency.' 'Are you sure?' 'Yeah, I'm sure!' She said, 'Well, what I assumed were your headlights have been shining at me now for about 45 minutes.' (They were right ahead of where I had stopped.) She said, 'I didn't think they were your headlights because they're like bright, white strobe lights. I can hardly look at them.' Shortly after that, they went out.\" After 30 months in the Army in- fantry in Europe during World War II, Bill Vogel was wounded, won the Bronze Star, and was transferred to the Air Force military police. After his discharge, he entered Washington State University and majored in forestry. After a hitch with the Bureau. of- Indian Affairs at the Klamath Indian Agency, he was trans- ferred to the Yakima Indian Reserva- tion. At its greatest length, the land Vogel scans for UFO activity mea- sures about 70 miles, at its broadest about 50 miles. Small, incorporated villages are situated only in the north- east corner, an isolated agricultural area of 118,000 acres. All other In- dian lands are officially closed to the public. The eastern boundary is marked by the Yakima River. High- way 97 (the Goldendale Highway) traverses the Reservation from the southeast. With many areas roadless and isolated from civilization, the Reservation in some cases can be traveled only by horseback. From May to October of each year, fire lookouts are on duty (10 days on, 4 days off). Many of these lookouts are PORTLAND Yakima Indian Reservation (Arrow) seasoned observers who have 20 years experience studying the terrain. Before 1972 Vogel had no opinion about UFOs. They were merely something \"in the news.\" In fact, when he began hearing tales of strange objects in the sky told by his fire-control staff, he greeted these with skepticism. It took his own sighting of a nocturnal light in the summer of 1972 to convince him that something extraordinary was going on. On a warm, starlit night, he was checking for lightning fires in the rangeland area of the Reservation. Travelling down the Goldendale Highway at about 2:30 a.m., Vogel witnessed in the sky a bright, tear- drop-shaped light sporting a seg- mented \"mouse tail\" on the narrow end of the tear drop. This appendage was flashing green, blue, white, and red lights. The rest of the object was bright fluorescent orange with a yellowish center. Parked on the side of the highway, Vogel watched the object for 5 or 10 minutes and had plenty of time to take pictures with the camera he always carried with him. Eventually the object travelled due south in an apparent straight line over the top of Sopelia Lookout, a distance of 20 (continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Yakima, Continued miles in 1 to IVz hours. The object was almost out of sight when he returned to Toppenish. 'That convinced me that there was something to what these guys were talking about. . . And of course it whetted my appetite too so that I would start going out a little more and looking around and seeing more . . , Everybody suddenly be- came very conscious of this phenom- enon.\" The Nocturnal Lights Vogel is a soft-spoken man who chooses his words carefully as he speaks. He talks with authority earned from 10 years experience with lights in the sky. \"When you see something that is quote-unquote a 'UFO/ you instantly recognize it as such. I've found that if there's any doubt in my mind, it usually isn't. It's kind of like looking for fires in the woods after a lightning storm or a rainstorm. There's a lot of ground fog coming up and you would swear it's a fire. But if there's doubt in your mind, ninety-nine point nine percent of the time it isn't a fire. If it's smoke, you recognize it immediately.\" The UFOs, predominantly noctur- nal lights (NLs), fall into two groups: bright, orange-red luminescent globes often having yellowish centers, and white lights often with multicolored lights on them, either around the cir- cumference or fixed on opposite edges. Few of these NLs can be mis- construed as planets, stars, or conven- tional aircraft because of their color and erratic behavior. Although Vogel has. had a few legitimate NL reports of hovering objects, almost every report that he receives is of an object that was either moving when or after it was seen. In some cases, objects have been silhouetted against hillsides or ' have risen up from behind trees. Armed with 10-power binoculars and cameras, the lookouts have got- ten good views and a few rare pic- tures. Although Vogel admitted to me that 'The closer [the object] is the more credibility I think you have to give to what you see,\" he emphasized that the many years of experience that lookouts have ('They know what should be where\") and the reputations of the witnesses indicate that something is going on. Between 1972 and 1974, UFO ac- tivity increased on the Reservation and was heavier than that of any other area in the United States at the time — although the high level of ac- tivity could have been the \"result\" of a greater awareness and conscious documentation of the phenomenon on the part of Vogel and others. During the high-activity period, Center for UFO Studies investigator David Akers of Seattle periodically visited the Reservation to observe and photograph NLs. However, the nighttime objects were seemingly aware of the approach of an outside observer. Vogel put it this way: \"Strange as it may seem, when these objects were spotted, if there was any radio traffic about them at all (lookouts radioing a sighting), they would quickly disappear. As soon as it seemed they realized they were spotted by somebody who started talking about hem, they'd vanish. When Dave first started coming over, I would call the lookouts and say, Dave may be up this evening' so that they wouldn't be frightened if he pulled up there and just parked in the middle of the night. We had to quit that because as soon as we did that nothing would happen. I , mean, maybe we could have activity like you' never believe Monday through Wednesday. Thursday I'd call and say Dave's going to be up your way Thursday night. He'd come over from Seattle and nothing would happen un- til Dave left.\" To \"thwart\" the UFOs, Akers began arriving with a minimum of publicity. He would stay three or four nights and observe, though on the first night he might get some pictures and the following nights no UFOs would appear. He did manage, how- ever, to take several very good pic- tures during some of the late-night vigils. These pictures show definite orange globes of light with yellow centers. Because of time exposure, many of the objects appear globlike or diffuse and leave jagged tracks in the pitch-black sky. During this period, Akers built a magnetometer to record possible magnetic effects associated with the UFOs. The instrument was installed in one of the lookout towers and several times was set off by an unobservable \"something.\" However, the sound of the magnetometer going off upset the lookout more than the possible appearance of UFOs, and the project was discontinued. If wandering orange-red globes of light weren't enough, other strange objects and events began making themselves known. In two or three cases, lookouts witnessed rocket-like objects \"fired\" into the heavens. One night a lookout noticed a red glow behind a butte. \"As she was watching,\" Vogel said wryly, \"out from behind this butte came this rocket-type of object that — 'whoosh' — went right up into the sky and disappeared into the strato- sphere. It was similar to ... watching a firing at Cape Canaveral.\" Lookouts began seeing columns of flame in the woods at about dusk. These flames were compared to a single tree flaring up or crowning out. As the lookouts watched the flames, they would mysteriously vanish. \"And yet,\" Vogel said, \"it was dry enough that you'd know that one tree couldn't burn without setting the rest of the woods on fire.\" The next day, observations from the air showed no signs of scorching or burning on the ground below. Add to these events inexplicable underground noises. Witnesses have likened these vibrationless sounds (Vogel hasn't heard them) to logging trucks trying to make the top of a hill and never getting there, or to turbines at Grand Coulee starting up, reaching full rpm's, and then running for hours. The sounds are always heard in early evening or late at night and have been heard by loggers and observers at Sopelia Lookout, Satus Peak Lookout, Mill Creek Guard Sta- tion, and Fort Simcoe in a roughly 30-mile-long area. Vogel hypoth- esizes that underground lava tubes (continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Yakima, Continued may be carrying sound at a distance. However, this hypothesis doesn't square with the timing of the sounds — night when daytime logging would be shut down — or the nature of the sounds. According to a cor- respondent of Vogel, a similar underground sound has been heard near a ranch in Goldendale, 20 miles south of the Reservation, and Vogel has been told of a similar phenom- enon emanating from an area of the Angeles National Forest and an area of the northeastern United States. Add to this oddity \"mental tele- pathic\" effects. For example, a lookout at Sopelia spotted a \"saucer\" hovering 100 to 200 yards away over the trees. When she reached for her binoculars and looked back, the \"saucer\" was gone. She went to the door with the intent of stepping out from under the overhang of the tower to look for it. \"As she opened the door,\" Vogel recalled, \"she got a strong feeling telling her, 'Do not step outside that overhang or you're going to be hurt.' It was almost like some- one was telling her. And she said that it was so strong that as much as she wanted to look around, she shut the door and stayed in.\" The lookout then heard a sound above the tower dying away, like water going down the drain of a bathtub. The feeling she had ex- perienced passed, and she freely stepped outside. There was nothing there. Besides the Oak Spring Road, there is another road on the Reservation that Bill Vogel would rather not go down late at night: the Pump House Road. Off this road, a Fish and Wildlife biologist at the local Federal game refuge had a number of weird experiences. Occasionally the biologist would see lighted objects setting in his back yard that would fly off when he approached them. At other times he witnessed red lights moving like snowmobilers across the terrain, or what appeared to be a lighted sheepherder's camp, with sheep included, in a distant hillside. Investigating the next day, he would find no evidence of tracks or human A MT. RAINIER TO YAKIMA A AHTANUM RID QE TIMBER « 'LINE MABTOM **.

The biologist's secretary lived in a small house some distance from the scientist's government-furnished dwelling. She said that several times at night a bright light would shine through her window and awaken her. One night Vogel was investigating a sighting she had had. While speaking with her, he heard footsteps crunch- ing in the gravel outside, passing in the dark. \"She never batted an eye. 'Oh,' she said, 'you heard that walk- ing by on the gravel. The biologist and his family are gone. There's nobody home. But you hear that walking by on the gravel all the time.'\" Vogel hasn't forgotten the lone policeman who often travelled down Pump House Road in the early morn- ing hours to break the boredom of the dead hours of his beat by looking for UFOs. As Vogel told it, the officer would travel down the road between 2:00 and 4:00 a.m. and take the first connecting road off Pump House Road back into town. Strange Events \"This one time,\" Vogel said, \"he went down the road and he had the darndest experience he ever had in his life. He pulled onto Pump House Road, and he said that he didn't know what came over him, but he turned on all his red lights and siren and went down the road just as fast as he could go. He said, 'I was just like a man possessed. I don't know what made me do it. I got down there about Lateral B or C,' which is a little bit fur- ther than where he normally turns, off, and he said, 'All of a sudden I kind of snapped out of it. What are you doing! And I shut the lights and siren off and made my way back to town. What came, over me, I don't know.' \" Objects have chased other officers on the same road. Their lights have gone out, their engines quit, their vehicles gone dead. One hapless rancher was hailed on the road one evening by a pasty- faced, stringy-haired creature at least seven feet tall. In a floating, 15-foot stride, the giant left its two compan- ions standing in a barrow pit at the side of the road and stepped in front of the rancher's car. Needless to say, the being's black outfit, white trapezoid on its chest, and general ap- pearance terrified the witness. Soon after he sped away, he was chased all the way home by a lighted object. Approached by a woman friend on the police auxiliary who asked Vogel if he would take her to look for possi- ble UFOs, Vogel drove out one quiet (continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Yakima, Continued night near the Pump House road. Stopping on the side of the old Goldendale Highway, Vogel heard rustling in sagebrush off to his left near the ditchline. At first he thought the sound of rabbits, but — \"As I sat there I started getting a •funny feeling; something isn't right.\" He suddenly realized what was wrong. They were in the wildlife refuge: coyotes should be howling, frogs singing in the marshland, birds chirping in the barely breaking dawn. Yet... \"There wasn't a sound. You could have heard a pin drop. It was that quiet. And I knew that wasn't right.\" Without mentioning the rustling to his friend, he turned his flashlight on the grass and observed an eye peer- ing out at him. Unlike the eye of a wild animal that reflects light, the eye did not. And instead of having the white of the eye, this eye was yellowish and had an hourglass- shaped pupil. Vogel debated shooting but -thought better of. it. There had been rustlers in the area and this was no time to rouse the game warden. Nor was it wise to risk their lives, whatever this thing was. He shut the light off and turned it back on. The eye was gone. Only rustling, then nothing. During the entire event, he never told his companion what he had seen or heard. The next day he approached her. \"I didn't say anything last night, but do you know what I was watching?\" \"I don't know what you were watching or what was going on, but I_ had a feeling like I had no business be- ing there. I don't know what it was, but you didn't seem scared so I didn't say anything. But I've never been so scared in my life.\" Vogel found trampled grass at the location the next day. While reason- ing that it could have been from a coyote, Vogel believed that the eye was too far off the ground for such an animal. If anything, the eye was rep- tilian. The closest match for the eye, he discovered through research, was that of a crocodile found in Egypt. \"What it was I don't know. But it definitely didn't belong there, and we didn't belong there at that time. I've never forgotten it.\" UFO Photo by Vogel August 20, 1972 Add to these encounters sightings of unconventional, cigar-shaped ob- jects flying up canyons during the day and never coming out; white balls that flit about; unexplained \"black- outs\" of the entire Reservation FM two-way radio system composed of 15 base stations and 100 mobile sta- tions and portables; and mysterious glows in canyons, and Bill Vogel begins to wonder. \"It's all these different things that just give you a feeling of ...\" His voice trailed off. \"I don't know. I don't know whether . . . we're just watching [the activity on the Reserva- tion] closer than, maybe, some of these other areas and are conscious of it, or what, but there's something go- ing on at the Reservation. It's a very interesting area, let's put it that way.\" Which is a fine example of under- statement in a man who is careful and cautious, yet who also invests a cer- tain amount of trust in people he has known or people he has no reason to doubt. \"I've never felt that anybody ever came to me with a story of seeing something just to be telling me. They had no reason to. Almost all the peo- ple that I got these reports from were people I had known for a number of years and I knew were credible wit- nesses.\" Gradually, over the past decade, Vogel has collected together the varied and bizarre pieces of a vast, unknown puzzle. Perhaps there will never be a solution to the UFO mystery. At present, science is deal- ing in the abstract, Vogel believes. Whether all the events on the Yakima Indian Reservation are interrelated or separate, Bill Vogel is only certain of what he has seen and has heard. He keeps an eye out for the unusual, whatever its possible relation to ongo- ing events. For example, earthquakes. In the last few months, lookouts have experienced small earthquake-like tremors that have not registered on seismographs at the University of Washington, and general earthquake activity has increased and been felt in a line from Goldendale to Toppenish to Mount Rainier. Some of these quakes have registered as strong as 5.5 on the Richter scale. Vogel is sure of one thing, however — UFO activity seems to be increasing on the Reservation after several years of little apparent activ- ity. What it all means is anybody's guess. \"Normally I've always been-a kind of opinionated person,\" he admitted, \"but on this whole thing I've been able, luckily, to keep a very open mind, and I haven't really made up my mind, well, this is this way or that's that way. The only thing that you can do is knowing the activity level here on the Reservation, then anything out of the usual that hap- pens, naturally you wonder whether it all ties together.\" \"The Reservation has pretty well run the gamut of just about any report from any place in the world,\" Bill Vogel says. \"We don't have anything that has been experienced here that hasn't occurred someplace else ...\" UFO activity on the Reservation is definitely on the increase in 1981, Vogel'claims, and three samples of re- cent UFO events demonstrate that range of diversity that continues to persist in this unique part of the world. • March 21, 1981, 9:30-11:00 p.m. At 9:30 in the evening, the family dog at a Yakima Indian residence 5 miles southwest of Toppenish begins to raise a \"fuss.\" Investigating, the 8-year-old daughter tells her mother to come and look at all the \"bright stars.\" Busy, the mother does not look until 15 minutes later when the dog, still upset, begins retreating toward the house. (continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"MEDICAL INJURIES CATALOG By John F. Schuessler The Houston, Texas, based Vehicle Internal Systems Investigative Team (VISIT) has focused its efforts on the scientific study of the effects cause by Unidentified Flying Objects (UFOs). It has become evident that any worth- while results of the study must in- clude measurable effects, rather than only an accumulation of anecdotal reports. Many of the witnesses of close encounters associated with the UFO incidents report substantial medical injuries. These medical in- juries can provide very definite clues as to the mechanism of the object causing the injuries. Project VISIT members and asso- ciates utilize accumulated data to ex- amine and predict modes and mech- anisms of physical systems that could cause the various noted medical ef- fects. Because of the lack of a single authoritative source of medical injury versus. UFO case, the study is pro- ceeding at a steady but slow pace. A catalog of medical injuries associated with UFO sightings is badly needed. After 2 years of data accumulation the writer has sufficient data to pre- pare a preliminary catalog to serve as a baseline for further study. The pres- ent plan is to generate the catalog in four sections. The sections are as follows: I. Paralysis Cases II. Apparent Radiation Effects III. Psychological Reactions IV. Other Conditions Each section will be date-ordered and begin with a brief overview of the in- cident, location, names (if available), a listing of medical effects, and the source of the data. Publisher and publication date are still to be determined. The important part of the task at this time is to con- tinue to accumulate and catalog the data. The end result should be of in- estimable value to researchers. —July 25, 1981. Yakima, Continued Outside on the front steps, the mother sees in the sky three triangle- shaped objects with greenish blue lights around their edges. A white light in the center of each object periodically flashes red. The triangles maintain a triangular formation. At the center of the formation are three bright, white lights in a horizontal line. The light on the left of the line breaks away and seems to merge or enter the left, rear triangle, then re- joins the other two. Eventually the white lights move away from the triangles and, retaining their line, \"do their own thing,\" while the triangles move about separately. The mother later describes the flight patterns of all six UFOs as those seen on computer games. During the display, the objects make a humming, buzzing sound sim- ilar to that of high-tension electrical lines. All the while, the dog barks and whines and makes every effort to enter the house. The daughter becomes very upset. The father comes home at HiOO p.m. and observes the objects for a few seconds until they move southward out of sight. Fifteen minutes later and 5 miles northeast of Toppenish, a police of- ficer observes in the western sky a bright, silent reddish-orange ball pass- ing from north to south at a very high rate of speed. • June 10, 1981, 12:15 a.m. A mar- ried couple driving west on a road toward their home on the Yakima In- dian Reservation are surprised by a cone of light that envelopes their car. Looking up through the windshield, the couple see a fairly large object shaped like a \"badge\" and pacing them at the height of a three-story building. On the periphery of the silent object are small, multicolored flashing lights. A pale yellow light in the center of the object, illuminated by two other pale yellow lights on the circumference, continues to emit the light beam until, after a mile, the ob- ject ascends straight up at a fairly rapid speed and disappears in a cloud- like mist of its own making. •July 15, 1981, 10:53-11:30 p.m. Sleeping in the lookout cabin on Signal Peak, the lookout on duty is awakened by a bright light and a strange noise. Looking through the north window, the lookout observes a bright, white light overhead. She immediately radios the lookout 20 miles east of Satus Peak. As the object moves north-northwesterly, the Signal Peak lookout witnesses a flame shoot out of the rear of the object, ac- companied by a roaring noise like a rocket launch at Cape Canaveral. The object \"goes out\" over Mount Rainier. Shortly thereafter, a similar (or the same) white, bright light appears in the north over Ahtanum Ridge and moves rapidly at the speed of a jet toward the southwest and Signal Peak. At a point above the peak, the object makes a right-angle turn, gains speed, and disappears over the west- ern horizon towards Puget Sound. Alerted to the appearance of the first light over the fire radio network, a fire control officer living 35 miles north-northeast of Signal Peak steps immediately outside and observes with 10-power binoculars the first ob- ject and its disappearance over Mount Rainier. As he continues to watch the empty sky, the officer's daughter, who accompanies him during the en- tire sighting, calls his attention to the second object over Ahtanum Ridge. He watches it reach a point above Signal Peak, make a right-angle turn, and disappear rapidly toward Puget Sound. Because of the distance, neither the Satus Peak lookout nor the fire con- trol officer see or hear flames from the first object. However, the Satus Peak lookout witnesses both objects and confirms the line of travel of the second object until it disappears from her view. D"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"RADAR-VISUAL UFO SIGHTINGS By Wayne Laporte In Ufology, a radar-visual is con- sidered a premium UFO case. After all, if a witness saw a UFO which also appeared on radar then we know that the person wasn't hallucinating. Figments of the imagination just don't show up on the radar screen. But, did the witness actually see a UFO? And, did the radar operator actually spot a UFO target on the scope? Verifying the presence of a UFO isn't always easy. To understand why, we must first understand how radar operates and the many limitations of radar. Radar works much like a scanning searchlight. A rotating searchlight sends out a high intensity beam while a revolving radar transmitter sends out an invisible radio frequency beam. A searchlight operator sees an object when part of the light is relected off the object caught in the searchlight's beam. Energy reflected back from a solid object in a radar beam is detected by a sensor located near the transmitter. The radar operator sees the object as a tiny spot of light (called a \"blip\" or \"target\") on the flat radarscope screen. A pointer, much like a seconds hand on a wrist- watch, continually sweeps around the scope at a given speed. A complete rotation may take from 2 to 15 seconds depending on the rotational speed of the transmitter. This \"sweep hand\" keeps pace with the revolving radar antenna-transmitter as it scans the sky. The range of a detected object is determined by timing the period re- quired for the radio frequency energy to make the roundtrip. Generally, the detection range of most Federal Avia- tion Administration (FAA) radars can be varied from 5 to 60 miles. Some FAA radars, however, can range up to 250 miles. Usually radarscopes are circular, and range to the object is measured radially from the transmis- sion site (center of the screen). An object being tracked will have moved a certain distance, depending on the object's speed, in the interval of time between antenna sweeps. A \"target\" remains stationary on the scope between sweeps and suddenly appears in a new spot when the radar beam once again strikes the object. By watching the \"blip's\" direction of movement and distance covered on the radarsceen between antenna sweeps, a radar operator can deter- mine the object's direction of travel and estimate its speed. The size and intensity of a \"target\" on a scope depends mainly on the type of aircraft (a prop plane generates a stronger return than a jet), the size of the plane (a large jet bomber produces a larger \"blip\" than a jet fighter), the distance from the transmitter (the intensity of the return will decrease with distance), the loca- tion of the aircraft in the radar beam (planes in the center produce a stronger return than those at the outer edges), and the construction of the air- craft (a plane with a metal covering will reflect more radar energy than one covered with fabric). Generally, most of the above also holds true for Unidentified Flying Objects. Although all radars work on the same principle, there are many dif- ferent types of radar which generate various kinds of beams. Most FAA air traffic control radars use what is known as a \"fan beam,\" because a cross-section of the beam is shaped like a fan. This type of beam is nar- row in azimuth coverage (about 1.5°) and broad in elevation (about 45°). The narrow width of the \"fan beam\" along with the broad elevation allows for more precise tracking of aircraft moving from one point to another. And, this type of beam is also quite adept at tracking UFOs. But, as we shall see, there are many reasons why radar isn't always able to confirm the presence of UFOs. One minor problem with radar is that it sometimes displays what ex- perts call radar mirages. A layer of warm air above a layer of cold air (or pockets of warm air in a cold air layer) cause what is known as a temperature inversion layer. Radar waves striking these inversion layers deflect downwards and pick up ground targets. \"Blips\" of these ground targets will appear on the scope, but they are spurious returns. As the layer shimmys about, the old \"false\" targets vanish and new ones appear. Skeptics make much to do about these \"ghost\" or \"angel\" returns by claiming they explain radar-visual sightings. However, radar operators can usually tell a \"ghost\" return from a solid one. These \"angel\" targets pro- duce weak returns, dart about er- ratically, and often disappear in one location and appear in another. But, a UFO sighting just might occur during weather inversion conditions. And, if the UFO was small (which means a weak return) and darting about (as some UFOs do) a radar operator might not be able to distinguish the UFO from \"ghost\" targets. This, however, would be an unusual situa- tion, as weather inversion conditions are generally infrequent. A major limitation of radar in con- firming a UFO radar-visual sighting may be the UFO's size. Small aircraft, particularly jet aircraft, produce weak returns. And, some very small single- seat \"experimental\" aircraft or fabric covered aircraft, are even \"invisible\" on radar. A tiny UFO is no exception. This means that you might have a small UFO flying circles over your house (or around your plane), well in the radar beam, and it might not even show up on radar — simply because it's too small.

UPOs at locations C, D, and E wouldn't even appear on the radarscope! Another important limitation may be the UFO's altitude. FAA, as most military radars, are angled slightly up- wards for better aerial coverage. This means the radar can only \"see\" down to a certain angle above the horizon. And, since radar waves travel in a straight line and the Earth is curved, the minimum detection altitude in- creases as distance from the radar site increases. So, UFOs flying at low altitudes (say at only a few hundred feet) could easily escape detection, even if only a few miles from the radar site. A UFO could also escape detection by hovering because most FAA radars are equipped with an MTI (Moving Target Indicator) computer. The MTI computer automatically removes all non-moving targets from the screen. The purpose of the MTI is to eliminate \"ground clutter\" (radar reflections from nearby tall structures such as tall buildings, bridges, and radio/TV towers). Only moving aerial \"targets\" will appear on the radar- scope. However, the MTI would also eliminate from the screen any hover- ing UFO, even if it was as big as a Boeing 747 Jumbo Jet! Also, contrary to what many believe, most FAA radars aren't able to determine altitude or climb rate of objects being tracked. So, sudden changes in altitude or high ascension rates of UFOs can't be verified by radar. Why? Because most FAA radars are only able to establish the bearing and range of the object from the transmitter. A second, special type of radar is required to determine the altitude of \"targets.\" And, general- ly, only military radar sites have these special radars. FAA air traffic con- trollers, however, often know the altitudes of aircraft because many planes are equipped with transpon- ders. (continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"Radar-Visual, Continued A transponder is an electronic device which broadcasts a signal back to the radar equipment stronger than a mere radar reflection off a plane's surface. It also transmits information regarding the plane's identification number and altitude. This informa- tion appears directly on the scope next to the aircraft's \"blip.\" This would be an ideal way to iden- tify UFO \"blips\" from aircraft as UFOs aren't equipped with transpon- ders. Not all aircraft, however, are legally required to have and use transponders. Consequently, a radar operator can't tell a UFO from any other non-transponding target, unless the alien craft performs a maneuver beyond the capability of aircraft, and this maneuver is also observed on the radarscope. Fortunately for Ufologists there are several such maneuvers UFOs often execute which enable ex- perienced radarmen to identify UFO \"Blips\" from other non-transponding \"targets.\" For example, the \"target\" of an air- craft moving upwards or downwards out of the radar beam slowly \"fades out\" while the \"blip\" of an object moving into the beam slowly \"fades in.\" So, a solid return which instantly appears or disappears on the radar- scope would be an anomalous event. A sudden appearance would mean the object instantly materialized, decelerated into the radar beam, or came out of an absolute hover (move- ment less that 5 mph in any direction) within one radar sweep. Conversely, a sudden disappearance would in- dicate the object immediately de- materialized, quickly accelerated out of the beam, or went to an absolute hover within one radar sweep. And, no aircraft on earth can perform maneuvers such as these. Another \"giveaway\" maneuver would be a high-speed right-angle turn. A UFO making such a turn up- wards or downwards would cause its \"blip\" on the screen to suddenly stop. The radar return of the UFO making a fast right-angle course change would be seen to instantly move away at 90° from its last position. Air- craft, by comparison, are incapable of making right-angle turns and fast traveling jets require miles to make a sharp turn. The only exception is a helicopter, but a copter travels at slow speeds — less than 150 mph. A target's speed is another factor in identifying UFO \"blips.\" As already mentioned, the speed of an object can be estimated by noting the distance the \"target\" moves between radar sweeps. Our fastest military jets fly at about 2,500 mph. Anything flying faster than that would have to be a missile or UFO. Missiles, however, are generally launched from known test areas, and a radar operator could quickly check with any nearby missile bases to determine if any missiles had been launched. Also, an aircraft can only accelerate or decelerate so fast without the oc- cupants or aircraft sustaining any damage. Most radar operators know these rates for conventional aircraft and missiles. Consequently, any \"blip\" exceeding these rates (there have been eyewitness reports of UFOs zooming away or coming to a stop at fantastic rates of acceleration and deceleration) would undoubtably be a UFO. Now, a large \"target\" that suddenly divided into two or more \"blips\" would also cause a great deal of ex- citement in the radar room. Such an event would indicate that a UFO split into smaller craft or that several UFOs were flying in very close formation and suddenly split. On the other hand, this type of radarscope display might also indicate that a close flying formation of aircraft entered the area and then broke formation. A radar operator, in such circumstances, would have to closely study the size, behavior, and speed of the departing \"targets\" in order to determine if the objects are UFOs. Also, a large \"blip\" from which smaller \"blips\" emerged would be quickly noticed by radar personnel. This unusual sight on the scope might indicate that a UFO \"mothership\" was launching smaller craft. But, the same radar image would also appear if a large military aircraft (like a C130 or B52) was launching missiles or drones (pilotless, remote-controlled aircraft). POSSIBLE ABDUCTION (From UFO Research of Finland, Third Quarter 1981 Quarterly Report) On July 31, 1981, two 35-year-old vacationing men were traveling toward Lieksa, Finland, in their motor boat. At 8:40 p.m. they were passing the Vaaraniemi Cape when they saw a black sphere in the sky with one large light and several smaller ones around it. The black object, with two lights on it and covered with \"fog,\" then approached the stern of the boat. One of the men felt paralyzed and couldn't move his head, but he con- tinued to talk with his companion. Then the object left. The men found that they were not sitting at the same locations in the boat as they had been when the sighting started. Despite strong water currents and wind, the boat was still near the Cape. Looking at their watches, they discovered that it was 4:10 a.m. on the following morning. They could not account for the seven lost hours. Afterwards they suffered from shaking hands, nightmares, and disrupted sense of balance. Two at- tempts to hypnotize the men failed. A check established that the phenom- enon was not a Russian rocket launch, and investigation is continuing. STAMP CONTRIBUTIONS We acknowledge receipt of can- celled foreign stamps, proceeds for which go toward improved interna- tional exchange of UFO information, from Dr. Robert Davis, Dallas, Texas and Robert Pratt, Lake Worth, Florida. Again, the radar operator would have to closely observe the speed and behavior of the \"fleeing\" targets to determine if they are UFOs. The radar operator also could contact any nearby military bases to verify if any such launchings were underway. As we have seen, radar can't always provide us with positive con- firmation of visual sightings. However, it's still one of the best tools we have in providing proof that aliens sometimes visit our skies.

The area is a desert region known popularly as \"La Zona de Silencio,\" about which there is a growing body of contemporary folklore ranging from stories of UFO activity to Devil's Triangle-like per- turbations in the local gravity and magnetic fields. The large Allende meteorite, judged to be of great antiquity (ap- proximately 13.5 billion years old) crashed just west of here, in 1968, near Hidalgo del Parral. On July 11, 1970, the nose cone of an American Athena rocket launched from Utah and bound for White Sands, New Mexico, also fell to earth here, some 880 miles off course. Much specula- tion currently surrounds the cause, if any, of these two \"coincidences.\" I was in the area conducting research for a magazine article, and was accompanied by two compan- ions, both of whom were able to con- firm and follow the observation in progress after I first drew their atten- tion to the object. I was the only one standing at the time, which put my eyes on an ap- proximate level with the horizon and probably explains why I was the first observer. Venus was readily visible in the southern half of the sky at an altitude of about 30 degrees. The moon, a week from full, was slightly higher and behind Venus on the eclip- tic, occupying the \"noon\" position. The light itself was first seen as a point, about 10 degrees above the horizon, and slightly further to the west than the planet Venus. Apparent brightness at this time was only a little less than that of Venus itself. My first reaction was: satellite; but the light came on much too fast and apparently low. My next thought was that it was a jet, but it was completely soundless and we were in a highly isolated area where the least sound carried easily. By this time I had alerted both com- panions by asking, \"Do you see that?\" As it neared the mid-heaven, it reached the highest point in its near- horizontal arc, which was no more than 20-30 degrees altitude. In fact, the overall impression was that the flight course was parallel to the cur- vature of the earth. At this position, a faint streak, or tail, was visible, trail- ing to the west, as the light source continued rapidly to the east. The brilliant \"star\"-point of light never varied in size or intensity, i.e., it never flared or dimmed, except as it even- tually faded from view in light haze over the eastern horizon. But now the tail, a thin, long, cone with a faint reddish tinge, was easily visible. It was not at all the sort of bright streak associated with \"falling stars,\" which were numerous through- out the night. Finally, the light source vanished from view in the east, near the Pleiades, at the same height at which it was first seen in the west. Duration of observation was 20-25 seconds, from horizon to horizon. Horizontal meteor? 1955 MARINE PILOT SIGHTING By Willard D. Nelson UFOs seen by flight personnel are considered among the best reports because of the reliability and credibil- ity of those who operate aircraft. The following pilot report has not sur- faced for 26 years, perhaps because no one was interested in hearing about N.F.'s experience at the time it happened — not even his fellow Marine Air pilots and crew members. Let's hear the story in his own words. \"My Navy flight log book shows that on July 27 and 28, 1955, I flew GCI (Ground Control Intercept) hops out of EYW (Key West Naval Air Sta- tion). My radar operator was the same both nights, a Mr. Moreau. I'm relatively sure it was on one of those flights that I saw what I'd call a UFO. We were on a heading of 360° (north) in a Douglas F3D-2 \"Skyknight\" at ap- proximately 25,000 feet. The time was after 11 p.m. and before 1 a.m. It happened toward the end of the hop because I think we continued straight north, let down and landed at Key West Naval Air Station afterward. \"I was making a 'run' on another of my squadron aircraft using self- contained radar with assistance of a ground radar located at or near Key West. We had just finished the run and were levelling out in a 'trail' posi- tion with the other aircraft, also an F3D-2, when looking to my left I saw a red light at what appeared to be our altitude and at a distance of 3 to 5 miles. After a few moments I looked again and it was at the same relative 8 o'clock position and pretty much at the same distance. Because I couldn't tell if it was closing on me I began to check frequently. Before long its relative motion led me to feel it was closing, or that we were on a crossing course, so 1 watched all the more closely to see if I needed to advise my fellow pilot ahead to be alert to the light off our left. \"About the time I was getting un- comfortable, the red light began to parallel our course, so I just watched, trying to see cabin lights. I thought it was a commercial airliner going from Havana to Miami or some place in the USA, since we were between Cuba and Florida. I could see no other lights, including the green starboard (continued on next page) 11"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"Marine Pilot, Continued wingtip light that, were it an airliner, should have been visible to any other airplane from this position. \"While I was sorting through this and trying to 'get a handle' on what was going on, an enormous 'exhaust' appeared where the red light had been. I was awed by it and surprised. All I could do in the way of respond- ing was to key my intercom and say to my radar operator who was in his radar boot (a shielding device that blocks out external light) 'Look, look! look! look!' Needless to say, he popped his head up and immediately said, \"what IS it?\" as he looked. I replied, 'I don't know.' Within seconds it had accelerated straight ahead and vanished with us watching in such amazement that we didn't speak further until it was gone. \"Then I called the ground radar, which was north of us in the path of its flight, 'and asked if they had a bogie on their scopes. After a brief pause they replied, 'negative.' I gave them its heading and altitude and said it was really going fast. They replied that my partner plane and I were all they had. The pilot in the plane ahead spoke up at this time and said he didn't see anything — so the matter was dropped, except in the minds of my radar operator and myself! We mentioned it to a friend or two in the ready room upon our return but no one seemed very impressed or interested. I guess both of us per- manently dropped it at this point 'for lack of a second.' That was 26 years ago and I can see it in my mind today as though it happened 5 minutes ago. No report was asked for or filed. As I recall, the newspapers on the follow- ing day had articles about UFO sightings at Miami and Washington, D.C., that same night and about the same time plus or minus an hour or so. \"Our airspeed had been some- where around 275-300 knots. The UFO, when the 'exhaust' began, moved out so fast I'd guess it went from our speed to maybe a couple thousand miles per hour in the brief 8 to 10 seconds that it took to go out of sight. To the best of my memory I do not recall feeling any vibration like one probably would feel that close to a shock wave from something passing through the sound barrier, which I feel sure it did. \"I guess the thing that perplexed me the most was how the other pilot ahead of me didn't see it, because he was a very keen pilot and really stayed on top of things. I don't feel he was trying to cover up anything. What may have happened: he was an older, more experienced pilot and outranked me. He may have thought it would reflect adversely on him if something like a UFO flew alongside him then let out a great exhaust and took off fast without him seeing it. In other words, it could have been a big embarrassment to him for me to say a UFO flew beside us both and he didn't even see it. For' me to persist would have been like slapping a senior officer in the face.\" N.F. goes on to describe the 'enor- mous exhaust.' \"Assuming it was 150 yards away, while it was paralleling me off the left wingtip and when the exhaust started, I'd estimate its length in the neighborhood of 20-30 yards and its width maybe 10-15 feet. It seemed to appear in its entirety almost instantaneously. It didn't start small and grow big. Its color was predominantly orange mixed with blue, yellow, red and green. It looked very much like the exhausts of rockets used to launch spacecraft at Cape Canaveral, only it was horizon- tal and I could see nothing ahead of it. Moving rapidly ahead of us, it diminished in size to a pinpoint of light, all on a straight course (due north) and the same altitude.\" (Author's note: rocket launch exhausts are usually white, not these unusual colors, so I am inclined to speculate this was some sort of plasma effect.) The weather was clear and visibility unlimited. I don't recall if there was a moon. Frankly, someone would have a very difficult time convincing me it was anything other than what I've described. Up to that time my aware- ness and interest in UFOs was, on a scale of 10, about a 1 or 2. Even after- ward, it was not much more except that when a UFO was mentioned or read about I invariably thought of my own experience and would wonder a bit. It was pretty obvious that it could have done whatever it wanted and we wouldn't have been able to avoid it acrobatically. \"Being in helmet, earphones and ' oxygen mask, I heard no sound and the radios did not seem to be affected. My plane functioned normally through- out. Physically I felt nothing abnor- mal. Mentally and emotionally my state was that of amazement at the size of the exhaust and the speed at which it accelerated out of sight. I don't feel it diminished in size, giving the illusion of departure, but actually accelerated into the distance.\" Although old, the significance of this event could be its relation to other apparent sightings the same night over Miami and Washington as reported in some newspapers. Did the same UFO leave an extended record of its path? These cities are in the same northerly path taken on depar- ture by the UFO. I do not have access to files of old reports. Somewhere in the literature exists a record of sightings of July 27 or 28, 1955. In order to complete this record, perti- nent information from colleagues, forwarded through MUFON head- quarters to this author, will be greatly appreciated. Willard D.

Close encounters occur less fre- quently, and very few landings occur here. Those landings which an reported seemingly leave no residual traces which would lend themselves to scientific follow-up study. Beginning in September 1979 there was an unprecedented buildup of very close encounter reports which continued into January of 1980. Dur- ing this same period, numerous reports of NLs and DDs were re- ceived through SKYNET channels. 2 Los Angeles, it has been said, is a bunch of suburbs seeking a city. In ac- tual fact, Los Angeles proper (in- cluding a myriad of communities in- corporated within it) is about 50 miles long and about 12 miles wide. Prac- tically every square mile is built up with residences and industrial build- ings. Only the hills which form our famous, smoggy basin are relatively isolated. In the 10-week period from August 3 to October 12, 1979 there were 12 cases of comparatively high strange- ness reported through SKYNET chan- nels. These included two of the most extraordinary and closest encounters ever to be reported in this area. Ex- tending this concentrated flap period back to July 23,1979 and forward to March 25,1980 there were 23 reports of moderate strangeness, including another close encounter on January 3, 1980 which was apparently as close as any ever reported. Because of limited space, only the most cogent details of these three close encounters can be given here: 1. On September 14, 1979 at 7:55 p.m., two women 3 driving in a car stopped at a major intersection in Canoga Park, a Los Angeles com- munity 20 miles northwest of Los Angeles Civic Center. While they waited for a red light to change, they suddenly saw \"an enormous round or elliptical object which looked like two bowls put together\" cavorting over the road ahead. Jets of flame were seen spaced around its perimeter. The object's apparent size was 4 to 6 inches at arm's length. It seemed to be no more than 100-200 feet from their car and 200-300 feet above the earth. The object, \"at super speeds,\" tilted, scooted, hovered, and scooted again in a small section of sky. After about a minute it took off at very high speed and disappeared into the north- east. Although the object was silent, the two women could not understand how such a huge, brilliantly lit object could maneuver so openly over a heavily settled region of the city. They did not notice any other car in sight at the time, so there was no op- portunity to seek additional wit- nesses. They were both very in- terested in parapsychology, but could not relate to anything in their ex- perience which could provide a satis- factory answer to what they had seen. The case was also investigated by MUFON's Morrey Allen, and an art- ist's sketch was produced with the help of the witnesses which vividly showed the strange but beautiful giant object. At least two other reports were received for the Canoga Park area matching the same time and date as the close encounter, but these witnesses were all some distance from the intersection in question. Unfor- tunately, these cases could not be followed up due to an injury suffered by investigator Allen about this time. 2. On October 12, 1979, while the flap continued unabated with in- teresting NL and DD reports flowing in at a rate of one to three per week, one of my trusted friends, Dorothy Shapiro of Los Angeles, confided a startling incident which had occurred while she was riding in a car on the Golden State Freeway in Burbank, a city 12 miles due north of the Los Angeles Civic Center. . Dorothy was riding alone in the back seat while her adult daughter, Susan, and a fuend were in the front. They were headed toward the Holly- wood-Burbank Airport. The car had just passed a number of commercial buildings and parking areas when Dorothy suddenly heard a peculiar rattling noise in the sky above the car. Looking through the left rear win- dow, she saw a \"circular kind of air- craft\" flying low, apparently over the busy freeway (see sketch). She tried to figure if it was some sort of ex- perimental U.S. observation platform, since it seemed to be in the landing pattern of the airport. In the 30 seconds she had it in view, she noted numerous details of its construction. It was black or dark gray like cast iron, with a dull \"stucco-like texture rather than smooth.\" Its shape was like a bowl with a solid circular section on (continued on next page) 13"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"California Report, Continued the. bottom. As the object changed its angle slightly, the witness saw that the sides also were solid, and a row of white lights were around the rim. The object seemed to be about 200 feet above the freeway and to be close enough to the car so that it ac- tually seemed to be above (or following?) the freeway. Its motion was slow, perhaps hovering or travel- ing at a very slow rate of speed. It .gave off a steady, rather loud \"rattling noise like an old-fashioned motor.\" The angular size was probably three inches, and the time 6:50 p.m. The car in which Ms. Shapiro was riding was moving in steady traffic, and before Dorothy could call the at- tention of her daughter and friend, they had passed by the object and it was lost to sight behind them. Dorothy did not think to notice if any drivers or passengers in other cars around them seemed aware of the amazing sight.* Dorothy Shapiro's integrity, in- telligence, and observational ability are excellent. She holds a responsible bookkeeping position with a major Los Angeles newspaper. She is also deeply interested in metaphysical subjects. She was not aware of the UFO flap going on in the Los Angeles area at the time and was amazed to hear that we had gotten another very close encounter report just 4 weeks prior. Her report, though a single- witness situation, cannot be doubted. We can only assume that she saw ex- actly what she reported, inexplicable though it was. If the same object had been reported in an isolated rural area, it would not have seemed half so strange as being reported flying low over a busy city freeway. As inexplicable as these two CE-Is seemed, they were relatively mild compared to a close encounter which occurred on January 3, 1980. This case had several aspects which bespeak of its believability. One of the two women percipients is an adult daughter of a veteran Los Angeles researcher. 5 This researcher tape- recorded his daughter's experience Underside Oct. 12, 1979 UFO, Burbank, California within one-half .hour of its occur- rence. A few days later, when all three witnesses (including a teen-aged daughter of the other woman witness) were regressed hypnotically in an at- tempt to obtain added details, all of the conscious and subconscious state- ments of the three witnesses were non-contradictory and had not changed from the original version. 3. The sighting occurred in Van Nuys, a suburb of Los Angeles 15 miles northeast of Los Angeles Civic Center. It is important to note that these witnesses, like the three others in the two prior CE cases, were totally unaware of the localized flap occur- ring at the time. (In Los Angeles, researchers are not aided, or hindered as the case may be, by media cover- age of UFO reports. For the most part, local sightings are ignored by newspapers, radio, and TV, and researchers have opportunity to work in an uncontaminated environment, as far as possible \"copy-cat\" reports might be concerned.) In the'January 3, 1980 incident, the two women witnesses were traveling by car to a local fast food restaurant at 8:30 p.m. Also in the car were four children, three of whom were under 5 years of age. As they passed'Mul- holland High School on Van Owen, which the teenager would soon be at- tending, they stopped the car to look over the grounds, of the school. Within a few minutes, one of the women noticed a large bright light in the sky. It suddenly dropped down to within 50 feet of the car. All wit- nesses agree that it was shaped like a huge disk covered with individual bright lights.. It first showed a half- round, flattened shape, then it tilted, showing the top clearly. A solid, opaque hump was seen on top, with a row of porthole-light lights circling the lower part. On the very top was a blue light. The angular size covered the windshield of the car. The witnesses had varying reac- tions to this startling sight. The mother of the children considered it to be a \"beautiful sight, almost like a divine encounter.\" The other woman (daughter of the UFO investigator), on the other hand, experienced ter- ror, as did the teen-aged girl. After a few seconds, the object \"shot back up into the sky\" and was joined by two other lights. The three lights formed a triangle and moved away out of sight. Because of the credibility of the one witness in particular (the re- searcher's daughter) and the fact that all three witnesses' statements re- mained non-contradictory, even when interviewed and hypnotized separately by three different research- ers, 6 the case received more attention than the two preceding it. It was evi- dent by now that huge UFOs were being repeatedly seen approaching cars in the midst of heavily settled urban areas. It was learned that the site of the January 3 incident was near the edge of a landing area of a small local air- port and that a private Cessna had taken off sometime near the reported time of the sighting. Although this in- formation was enough to convince the Center for UFO Studies that the case was probably a situation of (continued on next page) 14"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"California Report, Continued \"mistaken identity,\" researchers close to the situation maintained doubt about this explanation. All three witnesses were adamant that it could not be a a private plane taking off — \"no way\"! The details of the object — rounded shape, top hump, lighted ring of \"portholes,\" central blue light, plus the tilting and rapid ascent to join two lights which had the identical ap- pearance of the main object when first seen, plus their departure in triangular formation — bespoke of a valid UFO experience. But could a huge craft, even though silent, at least 100 feet in length, approach a parked car within 50 feet and not be noticed by other residents living in homes ad- jacent to the school? A search for other witnesses was unfruitful. The hypnotic regression of the three witnesses yielded confirmation of their conscious recall of details, and some hints that perhaps the mind of the teen-aged witness had been aware of some details of the interior of the craft. There was also some evidence that the mother of the children has suffered some physiological effects reminiscent of disturbances in blood chemistry. However, these details cannot be covered in this article, which intends only to point up the problems inherent in very close en- counters in heavily settled environs. Summing up the three stated cases, all six percipients in the three separate cases did not know each other and to this day are unaware of each others' experiences. It is perhaps interesting to note that all percipients were women. In addition to these three, another CE occurred within this flap period, on August 4, 1979, also in Canoga Park. At 10:35 p.m. a 6-year-old boy and his grandmother viewed from the windows of their home a \"large, glowing disc\" with a bubble-like dome on top. \"Two forms\" were seen inside the dome. When questioned for details, the witnesses could remember only that the seemingly humanoid forms had \"large heads.\" The sighting duration was minimal — a few seconds at most — and no satisfactory estimate of apparent size could be obtained. A detailed in- vestigation was not made. 7 In view of my recent column con- cerning the large cigar-shaped \"carrier craft\" UFOs which appear, or form, over the channel waters west of mid- Southern California coastline, it is also interesting to note that the localized Los Angeles flap described above began on July 23, 1979 with the sighting of a group of five or six large, glowing disks traveling in formation front the region of the Santa Catalina, San Clemente offshore islands. Reported by Mr. and Mrs. F. R., 8 the objects took a V-shaped formation and traveled swiftly inland. Then they hovered in a group for 10 to 15 minutes over the end of one of the runways of Los Angeles International Airport. One. suddenly streaked northward and the others dispersed in varying directions. All flew, according to Mr. R., as though under control. This situation was independently viewed and re- ported by another witness in another city about five miles south. 9 Are the UFO reports received by SKYNET from July 23, 1979 through January 3, 1980 a random collection of oddities — a mixed bag of unusual but conventional and grossly misiden- tified objects? Were perhaps a few valid, faroff UFOs thrown in here and there? Or can a patterned sense be made of this group of reports? Did they begin with fast-moving, forma- tioned orbs being released from an (unreported) \"carrier craft\"-type UFO high over Channel waters? Most importantly, can the very close, very bizarre, virtually \"impossi- ble\" close encounters described here as occurring over busy city streets be given credence? Occurring as they did during an intense period of UFO report activity which was completely unknown (or ignored) by the local media, can they be considered as \"real\" events? If they were real in every sense of the word, the unanswered question facing us is this: How and why do huge UFOs approach within yards of human witnesses without being de- tected by other witnesses in the immediate vicinity? FIREBALL IFO About 5:30 p.m. CST Dec. 9, 1981 a so-called \"fireball\" meteor was seen over the midwestern U.S. from Okla- homa to Indiana. Fireballs are sporadic but relatively large meteors resembling \"a plane crashing\" or a satellite re-entry. Unlike typical meteors, they often last 15-20 seconds. They may appear to \"land\" in the next field, but instead travel hundreds of miles before burning out. Sometimes they break up into smaller particles near the end point of their flight. 1 Veneta couple •f have encounter .(j f with red lights VENETA — Jimmy Trent and Lin- da Anderson were watching a televi- sion movie at his place Sunday night when a bright red light began shining through the living room window. Trent told Lane County sheriffs deputies they went outdoors and saw several of the strange lights, including one perched on a car and one that caused a plant across the street to glow. A -fan-shaped, rotating light \"swooped down near the road and ac- celerated at a high rate of speed south- bound on Third Street,\" the police re- port said. Tbe deputies found no physi- cal evidence of a UFO visitation but said there Is \"no reason to dispute\" the report. Trent said thai shortly before he called the sheriffs office, the UgU> \"sort of evaporated.\" NOTES 1.

Her hus- band was asleep in the bedroom. Sit- ting and facing the north, she wit- nessed a bright, white light moving down above the horizon at an angle toward trees approximately 150 feet away. She later estimated the size of the object as that of a full moon and compared the object to a \"headlight\" in its appearance. Familiar with air-, craft, the witness was certain that the light was bigger than an aircraft's landing light. The light appeared to pass between or above the trees and she noticed two red lights placed a little higher than the middle of the light and fixed one on either side. The light appeared to be equally bright all over without evidence of a supporting object or body. As the light drew closer, she heard an increasingly loud and unusu- al humming sound coming from the object. At its closest, the object was the size of two to three full moons. Excited by the sight of the object, the witness ran to the back of the house without her baby and looked through the back patio door. By this time, the object was out of sight (ap- parently heading southwest) due to a 50- to 60-foot-high tree that ob- structed her vision, although she heard the hum as it died away. During the day of May 1, the witness saw a helicopter in the area, and in comparing the apparent UFO to this aircraft, she stated that the UFO was three to four times as big. In an earlier conversation with the mother of the witness who lives in a trailer near the house, the mother stated that \"choking\" humidity was evident during the preceding day, but that during the early morning hours of May 1, the forced-air heater in her trailer came on because of unusually cold weather. She also said that there are \"very thick\" high-tension Wires near the house although she has never heard them hum. The mother tele- phoned the Clark County sheriff's of- fice who gave her the number of Phenomena Research. The mother was aware of the Mount St. Helens event (March 17) and stated that air- craft often pass overhead due to in- creased interest in observing Mount St. Helens. Total duration of the sighting was later estimated by the witness at ap- proximately 50 seconds. As the object neared the house, the witness said that it appeared dome- like, as if the round circle of light \"slanted in a bit.\" However, the object was definitely round, she said. The weather was cloudy and wet- no stars were in the sky. The witness estimated the time at 4:00 a.m. since her baby had been waking up at this time for several mornings in a row. I telephoned the .witness on May 6 after I received word of the sighting from Robert Gribble of Phenomena Research, Seattle. 1 spoke about 30 minutes with the witness, and she agreed to answer a MUFON ques- tionnarie. However, after waiting over 2 weeks for a reply and receiv- ing none, I telephoned the witness and received a tape-recorded message of \"number no longer in service.\" The operator stated that the customer had requested an unlisted number. OPEN LETTER TO ALL U.S. MUFON MEMBERS (Authorized by Massachusetts State Director Jne Santangelo) The following proposal is offered to all MUFON members in the United States in the hope of achieving a unified nationwide effort to gain the release of additional documents on UFOs under the Freedom of Informa- tion Act. The Fund for UFO Research will send a package of 200 pages of declassified FBI and CIA documents to anyone who makes a contribution of $30.00 or more to the Fund. We ask that every state chapter of MUFON get together, and order this package of documents either as a group or as individuals. Send check to: Fund for UFO Research, Box 277, Mt. Rainier, Maryland 20712. Because of the limited staff at the Fund Office, there will be a 4 to 8-week waiting period to receive the package of documents. Upon receipt of the package of documents from the Fund for UFO Research, we urge all MUFON mem- bers to select a document or two, make copies of it, and enclose it.in a letter to your U.S. Senators and Con- gressmen. Your letters should not be emotional or fanatical. Simply state that you would like to have the com- ments of the Senator or Congressman on the content of the enclosed docu- ments. If everyone involved in MUFON in the United States sends such a letter to his/her Senators and Congressmen, the U.S. Senate and House will sud- denly receive thousands of letters on this topic from all over the country. We also encourage members of CUFOS and APRO to join in this project, as well as any other in- terested citizens. Also, we understand that these declassified documents may be obtained from the newly re- organized CAUS group, and that there may also be some NSA docu- ments available. It is possible that many of our elected officials on Capitol Hill are totally unaware of the contents of the documents which have been declassified under the Freedom of Information Act. This na- tionwide effort on our part will demonstrate the need of the public to know the facts, and will also bring these documents to the attention of our Congress. It should further dem- onstrate that there is no sign of panic on the part of the public in regard to the topic of UFOs. As members of a scientific organi- zation involved and interested in the serious study of the UFO phenom- enon, it is incumbent upon every one of us to participate in this project in order to gain more facts about this vital topic. It is important that everyone act together and that we do so in the very immediate future so that the mail will start arriving on Capitol Hill at one time. An added bonus of this effort is that the Fund for UFO Research will receive some very needed funds for a very worthwhile cause. Massachusetts MUFON 16"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"Director's Message, Continued Toronto would be a forum for representatives of all nations to pre- sent their views, proposals, and ideas to further the work initiated by P1CUR at their two London con- ferences. It is conceivable that'their 1982 meeting could be held in Canada instead of England. This pro- posal is being made for their con- sideration; however, we recognize that it increases the travel distance for Europeans and the subsequent finan- cial cost. Some of the ideas proposed are definitely not original with your Director. Cooperation between the major UFO groups in the United States and Canada has been a goal for many of us, in spite of the obstacles that a small minority has voiced. A newcomer in the field, Ms. Barbara Schutte, a CUFOS Field Investigator and MUFON State Section Director for Des Moines and Lee counties in Iowa, has done an excellent job in making a formal proposal to unite and professionalize UFO research in her booklet titled \"UFO Clinical Services: A New Concept in UFO Research.\" She has elaborated ideas and details that some would consider idealistic; however, the day is rapidly ap- proaching when these goals will be achieved. Barbara has made her for- mal proposal available to the present- day leaders in Ufology for their con- sideration and evaluation. She must be congratulated for her insight into a problem that has existed for 30 years. Another 30 years of UFO research could pass without a resolution of this enigma, unless formal and coopera- tive steps are taken now. to attack this dilemma in a professional manner. Copies of her proposal have been mailed to APRO, CUFOS, CSW, MUFON, Fund for UFO Research, and several influential researchers. I am not suggesting that Barbara's plan is the ultimate; however, I am en- couraging the recipients to study it carefully and come up with their own proposals that may be discussed on July 4, 1982 in Toronto so that signifi- cant steps may be taken to make this goal a reality. It can be done with your combined help and cooperation. Commendations and roses to Barbara for providing the motivation and in- spiration in her proposal. Another significant and exciting trend has been developing during the past few years in Ufology — the emergence of women in leadership roles. Mrs. Idabel Epperson and Mrs. Mildred Biesele were MUFON's first State Directors, whereas many others are fulfilling responsible positions as State Section Directors, starting with Mrs. Rosetta Holmes in 1969. SKYLOOK and the MUFON UFO Journal can point with pride to our first editor, Mrs. Norma E. Short in 1967, and Mrs. Ann Druffel, current Associate Editor. This list would in- clude Mrs. Barbara Mathey and Mrs. Cynthia Hind who have served as Continental Coordinators for Africa. (No attempt will be made to list all of the dedicated women who are con- tributing their time, talent, and in- terest to MUFON _and Ufology, since the list would be extensive.) Joining this elite group, the follow- ing appointments have been made this month: Diane M. Tessman, 5021 9th Street So., St. Petersburg, FL 33705 to State Section Director for Pinellas and Hillsborough counties in Florida. Diane, a public school teacher, may be contacted by tele- phone at (813)'864-2726. Mrs. Marge Christensen, a secondary education teacher, 2 Cherry Road, Beverly, MA 01915 was promoted to State Section Director for Essex county by Joe Sant- angelo, State Director for Massachu- setts. Marge may be reached by telephone at (617) 922-6406. Having been educated in Sweden, Mrs. Birgit Stanford, 170-70 Cedarcroft Road, Jamaica, NY 11432, a Journal subscriber for several years, has volunteered to become a Swedish translator for MUFON. Birgit is the wife of Rex Stanford and a sister-in- law to Ray Stanford, Director of Proj- ect Starlight International. Reverend John E. Schroeder, 4991 Miami St., St. Louis, MO 63139 has accepted the position of State Section Director for St. Louis and Jefferson counties in Missouri, replacing William Christian who has asked to take a less active role due to his health. John has been president of the UFO Study Group of Greater St. Louis and a MUFON member since 1975. As a clergyman, his prime UFO interests are in parapsychology and Biblical corelatives. It is with deep regret that we accept the resignation of Tom Benson as State Director for New Jersey, due to personal reasons. Mr. Benson has been one of the most enthusiastic UFO researchers in New Jersey for many years, therefore his action was a surprise to all of his friends. It would seem that John E. Marsh, 6 Millfield Manor, Whitstable, Kent CT5 1RU, England had anticipated an article in the November 1981 edition of the Journal, whereby we had sug- gested MUFON would be very re- ceptive to donations of UFO books to perpetuate our library. Mr. Marsh mailed bound editions of the British magazine \"The Unexplained: Mys- teries of Mind, Space & Time\" from Volume 1-Issue 1 through Volume 4-Issue 38. This high quality magazine is published weekly by Orbis Publish- ing Limited, Orbis House, 20/22 Bed- fordbury, London WC2N 4BT, England. The format of this new magazine is similar to -the National Geographic, however, the subject matter is more specialized and in- cludes UFOs. The price per copy is $1.50 in U.S. funds or U.K. 50p I would like to take this opportun- ity to personally endorse the work be- ing performed by CAUS (Citizens Against UFO Secrecy, Inc.) headed by Peter Gersten, Legal Counsel, and Larry Fawcett, Investigations Direc- tor, that was recently incorporated to specifically obtain UFO documents under the Freedom of Information Act (Title 5 USC Section 552) from agencies of the U.S. Government. The Board of Directors is composed of practically all MUFON members. They are, in addition to Peter and Larry, Stanton Friedman, Ted Phillips, Bruce Maccabee, Barry Greenwood, Robert Bletchman, Bob Todd, Larry Bryant, and Ray Fowler. Their drive was kicked off on October 27, 1981 with a news conference at the Na- tional Press Club in Washington, D.C.

GSW in Phoenix, Arizona, has conducted computer enhancement analysis of the image, but efforts at further analysis have been stymied by a lack of cooperation on the part of the Costa Rican National Geographic Institute, who first discovered the im- age in 1979 while studying the aerial photographs for scientific purposes. The apparent UFO photograph was submitted to MUPON by Ricar- do Vilchez, member of a Costa Rican UFO organization, who had obtained it from the Institute. GSW was puz- zled by the fact that one edge of the UFO seems to be relatively flattened and planned further tests of that feature, but found no evidence of fraud and considers the photo to be bona fide. \"The image appears to be structured (an object with substance) and not any type of tenuous reflec- tion. We have, in the past, analyzed similar appearing shapes/images that were determined to be reflections, however, there are major differences within this photo that preclude this possibility,\" the GSW report said. Last year MUFON State Director 1971 Costa Rica Photograph Dr. Bruce S. Maccabee wrote to the National Geographic Institute at- tempting to obtain critical informa- tion needed to complete an analysis, also indicating possible financial sup- port from the Fund for UFO Research if needed to assure a thorough study. He requested copies of the photo- graphs preceding and following the one showing the image; altitude, speed, and direction of the aircraft; and all pertinent data on the camera used. There was no reply. D UFO NEWSCLIPPING SERVICE The UFO NEWSCLIPPING SERVICE will keep you informed of all the latest United States and World-Wide UFO activity, as it happens! Our service was started in 1969, at which time we contracted with a reputable international newspaper-clipping bureau to obtain for us, those hard to find UFO reports (i.e., little known photographic cases, close encounter and landing reports, occupant cases) and all other UFO reports, many of which are carried only in small town or foreign newspapers. \"Our UFO Newsclipping Service issues are 20-page monthly reports, reproduced by photo-offset, containing the latest United States and Canadian UFO newsclippings, with our foreign section carrying the latest British, AustraJian, New Zealand and other foreign press reports. Also included is a 3-5 page section of \"Fortean\" clippings (i.e. Bigfoot and other \"monster\" reports). Let us keep you informed of the latest happenings in the UFO and Fortean fields.\" For subscription information and sample pages from our service, write today to: UFO NEWSCLIPPING SERVICE Route 1 — Box 220 Plumerville, Arkansas 72127 Director's Message, Continued very favorable reaction from the news media, since their statement was published in newspapers coast to coast. It is imperative that the privilege of FOIA be utilized im- mediately, since it is quite probable that President Reagan may seek to tighten the conditions for releasing UFO documents. MUFON is indebted to William H. Spaulding, GSW Director, for having shared a partial set of CIA documents dating from March 31, 1949 through January 27, 1953 as a result of their early court suits. Bruce Maccabee submitted copies of the material that he secured through the FOIA from the F.B.I, to MUFON several years ago. Just recently, John A. Stewart, 168 West Hanover Avenue, Ran- dolph, NJ 07801 sent copies of UFO information that he had secured from the Department of State under the FOIA. We want to thank all three gentlemen for these valuable con- tributions to the MUFON FOIA file. On October 1, 1981, Richard C. Niemtzow, M.D., a consultant to MUFON, established a new project titled \"National Investigation of Medical Injuries Associated with Alleged UFO Close Encounters\" or simply Project UFOMD. For further information on this ambitious new project, please contact Dr. Niemtzow at 532 Merchant Street, Vacaville, CA 95688 or telephone: (707) 466-5050. MUFON endorses this new project, and encourages our medical people to participate. Before any report is published in the MUFON UFO Journal on cases in- vestigated by Project UFOMD, we want appropriate MUFON con- sultants to review and evaluate the data. The Cash/Ladrum case is a typical example of injuries that can occur when humans are exposed to heat and radiation, therefore this is a vitally important project. John Schuessler and Richard Niemtzow were originally instrumental in seek- ing attention for such cases. 18"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"Lucius Parish in Others' words The October 20 issue of National Enquirer reports on UFO activity and a suspected underwater UFO base in the so-called \"Devil's Graveyard\" region of Brazil. Some 1977-78 UFO sightings over Italy and Sardinia are reported in the Enquirer's October 27 issue. The November 3 issue tells of a glowing red UFO which buzzed a light plane near San Jose, California in February 1981. An Oregon UFO sighting and tape recording of UFO sounds are detailed in the November 10 issue. In the issue for November 17, Soviet scientist Alexander Kazant- sev's theory of visiting spacemen dur- ing the Stone Age is examined. Kazantsev feels that the \"Dogu\" statues found on the Japanese island of Hanshu are accurate representa- tions of spacesuits worn by extrater- restrials. A theory that some extraterrestrials might be humanoids descended from dinosaurs is examined in an article in the November 3 issue of The Star. The November 10 issue features ten \"baf- fling\" UFO cases which were re- ported by investigator Raymond E. Fowler in his book, Casebook of a UFO Investigator. It is understood that the October issue of Technology Review has an article on the MUFON UFO Symposium which was held at M.I.T. this past July. A controversial article in the November issue of OMNI is Allan Hendry's commentary on the \"star- map\" which has been widely dis- cussed in connection with the Betty and Barney Hill abduction case. Hen- dry .contends that the OMNI editors, by rewriting his contribution, have grossly distorted the meaning of it. As the article stands, it is a good example of the totally misleading material so often found in publications which are basically anti-UFO. Hendry's true feelings on the Hill case and the \"star- map\" will apparently be the subject of an article to appear in a future issue of FATE. If you are interested in \"anomalies\" which have been seen and photo- graphed on the surface of the Moon, you might like to check out the photo sets available from a California re- searcher who has reproduced NASA photographs from the Lunar Orbiter and Apollo missions. These are the same areas given prominence by. George Leonard in his book, Somebody Else Is On the Moon. It is possible to see something of a seemingly unusual nature at the points indicated on each photo, but interpretations are strictly up to the individual viewer. It is said that these particular photos are not the best ones which NASA has on file, so it would be very interesting to examine more detailed prints of the areas in question. Two \"volumes\" are available, consisting of five photos and commentary per \"volume.\" The price is $15.00 for each set, with a package of three Martian anomaly photos and commentary being priced at $12.00. The address is Lunar Photos, P.O. Box 2186, Van Nuys, CA 91404. UFO investigator Wendelle C. Stevens has received a lot of flak (totally undeserved, in my opinion) from many individuals and groups regarding his involvement in the Eduard Meier contact case in Switzerland. Now, he has published a book on yet another controversial case, that of William J. Herrmann of Charleston, South Carolina. Herr- mann, a non-believer in UFOs, was forced to re-evaluate his views and concepts when he began seeing UFOs in 1977. He managed to take several photos of the objects and then claimed to have been abducted by UFO occupants. Stevens entered the picture early in 1978, upon reading of Herrmann's initial sightings and pho- tographs. Since that time, he has kept in constant touch with the witness, following the events as they pro- gressed. When the book went to press, Herrmann claimed to have been on board a UFO on two different occa- sions, although his conscious memory of the events was temporarily blocked. He has now achieved full (?) recall of those experiences. The aliens claim to be from Zeta 1 and Zeta 2 Reticuli, the stars which figured so prominently (and now, controversial- ly) in the \"starmap\" research of Mar- jorie Fish. Their conversations with Herrmann make for very interesting reading, and there is much other material of considerable interest in the book. The volume is not designed as a literary work, but as an in- vestigative report. It has an unfor- tunate number of typographical and printing errors, but is attractively pro- duced, with color and black-and- white photos of the \"Reticulan\" craft, as well as numerous illustrations. I consider it an important work and one which is well worth reading. C9pies are available at $16.95 each from Reticulum, Box 17206, Tucson, AZ 85710. HIMALAYAN SIGHTING A UPI dispatch from Katmandu, Nepal (credit Tim Tokaryk for an Oct. 11, 1981 clipping from the Ed- monton Sun, Alberta) states that Italian Reinhold Messner, a promi- nent mountaineer, observed a UFO \"the size of a full moon\" for nearly 3 hours while climbing in the Himala- yas. The UFO was seen drifting south into Nepal from Tibet over the snow- capped mountains. It then moved east, southwest, and finally north back toward Tibet. 19"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"DIRECTOR'S MESSAGE by Walt Andrus During the recent Center for UFO Studies Conference in Chicago, members of the MUFON Board of Directors, who were present, met with three members of Project URD from Sweden, and discussed what role MUFON should play in the inter- national scene. Plans were also being formulated for the 1982 MUFON UFO Symposium in Toronto, On- tario, Canada on July 2, 3, and 4, 1982 at the Westbury Hotel, with Henry H. McKay as host chairman. Directors attending these sessions were John Schuessler, James Mc- Campbell, Paul Cerny, Henry McKay, Leonard Stringfield, and Walter Andrus. John Schuessler, Deputy Director, and Walter Andrus, International Director also met privately with Dr. J. Allen Hynek, Scientific Director, and John P. Tim- merman, Chairman of the CUFOS Board for the purpose of achieving greater cooperation in the future and preparations necessary for the next major UFO \"flap \" After a combination of meetings, including the one Henry McKay had with the UFO Research Centre: On- tario (UFORCO) in Toronto, it is the consensus of key leaders that the time is appropriate for a top level meeting of all of the major UFO organizations in the United States and Canada to be held July 4, 1982 in conjunction with the 1982 MUFON UFO Symposium in Toronto. Pete Mazzola, Interna- tional Director of the SBI (Scientific Bureau of Investigation) in Staten Island, N.Y., suggested that the meeting could be titled \"1982 UFO Summit,\" whereas our Canadian friends proposed that it be labeled a \"Global Perspective.\" As this proposal is unfolded in the following para- graphs, the readers will note that it encompasses both areas. Invitations to present papers at the 1982 MUFON UFO Symposium have already been extended to Dr. J. Allen Hynek and David Haisell. As the representative of Canada, Mr. Haisell will discuss the planning, status, and work accomplished by the Provisional International Committee for UFO Research (PICUR). Thus, both Canada and CUFOS will be represented. Your Director has ex- tended an invitation to Pete Mazzola, and the members of SBI (who are somewhat concentrated on the east coast) to attend. Pete was very en- thusiastic about accepting, since he has made a similar proposal. Since NICAP has completed its demise from the UFO scene, their former members are now serving in leader- ship roles in MUFON and an invita- tion would not be warranted. GSW, Inc. (Ground Saucer Watch) has demonstrated their cooperation throughout the years with MUFON and CUFOS, especially in their photo enhancement analysis. An invitation is hereby extended to William H. Spaulding, Director, or his assigned representative to participate in this upcoming meeting. Since the Aerial Phenomena Re- search Organization is one of the major UFO organizations in the United States, and certainly the oldest, I want to take this opportunity to invite the APRO Board of Direc- tors to send a representative who is authorized to speak for the organiza- tion in matters which may shape the future of Ufology in the world. The attendance of an APRO board mem- ber is essential if this meeting is to achieve its intended purpose. If there are other UFO organiza-. tions that desire to be represented at this significant conference, their direc- tor or president should so indicate by writing and signifying their desire to Walt Andrus before March 1, 1982. We want this meeting to be represen- tative of the finest people presently involved in Ufology in the U.S.A. I am proposing that three in- dividual meetings take place on Sun- day, July 4, 1982: (l) The Annual MUFON Corporate Meeting from 9:00 to 11:30 a.m.; (2) a North American \"Summit Meeting\" from 1:30 to 3:30 p.m.; and (3) a world- wide or \"Global Perspective\" session from 3:45 to 5:00 p.m. The purposes of the Summit Meeting would be to (a) unite our total efforts to resolve the UFO phenomenon; (b) present a united front to the scientific com- munity and the news media in the United States and Canada; (c) establish teams of professional in- vestigators throughout North America; (d) determine specialized research assignments that each organization is most qualified to per- form; (e) set up a public relations com- mittee of competent and qualified writers that are capable of obtaining favorable news coverage to help educate the scientific community and the general public concerning the UFO phenomenon; (f) systematically respond via a public relations commit- tee to the unfavorable propaganda being disseminated by the UFO Sub- Committee of the Committee for the Scientific Investigation of the Paranormal; (g) elect a member or members to represent the United States to the Provisional International Committee for UFO Research (PICUR); (h) provide direction to the representative(s) to PICUR so that a worldwide network of research teams in all countries could be established in the areas of field investigations, reporting, computerization of reports, assignment of research projects, financing, etc. (The plans of Project URD should be evaluated as it relates to this point; and (i) organize research committees composed of qualified people in such diverse fields as medicine, hypnosis, photography, propulsion techniques, field investiga- tions, veterinarians for animal reac- tions, psychologists, and laboratories available for soil and metal analysis.
