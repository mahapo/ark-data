In April 1991 two leading English researchers on the crop circle phenomenon, George Wingfield and John Haddington, visited California on a lecture tour. On April 14 they ap- peared for a six-hour presentation co- sponsored by MUFON and Starrion Productions of San Francisco. This report is a summary of their talk with some additional information culled from newsletters and periodicals com- ing out of England. T he current theories on the mech- anism and the meaning of crop circles fall very roughly into two camps, the Natural and the Mystical. The leading hypothesis in the Natural camp is the atmospheric plasma vortex theory advanced by Terence Meaden of TORRO. This postulates that wind cur- rents are manipulated by surrounding hills to create whirling air currents and ionized plasmas that form the patterns. There are numerous aviation safety studies that describe the power and un- predictability of air turbulence. Critics claim, however, that the complexity and precision of the crop pictograms rules out natural causes. They further claim there is a link to the many ancient stone tumuli (ceremonial sites such as Stonehenge) that dot the English coun- tryside. The plasma vortex theorists counter that the phenomenon has been going on for many years and that there may even be some hoaxers who sup- plement the natural formations. In their lecture, George Wingfield and John Haddington are quick to dismiss the plasma vortex theory. \"On- ly the most hardened skeptics still cling to that version of events,\" claimed Wingfield at the start. He went on to list some of the more perplexing find- So-called \"double pictogram\" formed on July 27, 1990, between the East and West Kennett Long Barrows, Wiltshire.

The stalks are bent but not broken. They are essentially undamaged. 2. Some impressions are only light- ly imprinted, an effect difficult to hoax. 3. There is a fine structure to the laid crop. There are sharp edges, and at times multiple layers in different directions. 4. Many of the shapes are elliptical. Hoaxes would more likely be circles. 5. There are sometimes narrow rings surrounding the circles. These are con- centric with the center circle, and are sometimes only a few inches wide. It's impossible to view these rings at ground level without wading through and damaging the crop, yet there are no signs of anyone entering the field. 6. The presence of \"grapeshot,\" numerous small circles adjacent to the main formation. 7. The phenomenon is worldwide. 8. The scope and precision of the large pictograms, often several hundred feet long. 9. Eyewitness accounts of circles ap- pearing 'as if an invisible force were pressing down the crop. 10. A large number of formations, over 1000 reported in England in 1990 alone (see Table 1). 11. The Operation Blackbird hoax was easily detected as fraudulent. 12. Dowsing evidence. With a high degree of consistency dowsers report the pictograms lie across or along ley lines. One curious observation is that many pictograms seem to be oriented with their major axis along the tram lines that farmers use to spray their crops. American farmers generally use crop duster aircraft to spray insecticide, but the British use tractors that ride along these tram lines. Wingfield relates a story of how one farmer, determined to outwit the supposed hoaxers, decided not to spray his crops. Despite the lack of tram lines, and much to the frustra- tion of the farmer, his crops exper- ienced a large pictogram shortly thereafter. This is typical of the con- founding effect the circles seem to display. Just when one researcher The first \"double pictogram\" appeared July 11,1990 at Alton Barnes, near Adam's Grave, Vale of Pewsey. One hundred and thirty-five meters long, it attracted thousands of curious visitors.

With a rapt audience, Wingfield and Haddington didn't go very far in ad- dressing the possibility that the forma- tions are the result of natural processes. Even if hoaxes and wind vortices are ruled out, there may be other natural forces at work. These alternative hypotheses are discussed in some of the many fine books and newsletters from England (see Sources below). Other natural theories for the creation of the crop circles include magnetic anomalies, seismic events, sound waves, electromagnetic radiation, cosmic radiation, some form of in- teraction with ancient tumuli, chemical reactions from the soil, gas emissions, etc. A menagerie of animals has also been suggested, including pigs, hedgehogs, birds, foxes, even worms. None of these concepts however seems able to explain all, or even most of the odd characteristics of this mystery. The underlying assumption of the mystical view is that the agriglyphs have symbolic meaning, and are therefore the result of an unknown intelligence. Clearly, the first impression most witnesses have is that there is informa- tion in these patterns. The only remain- ing question then is what do they mean? With the tremendous increase in the number of formations in 1990, a number of experts in various fields Table 1.

Crop Patterns Likened to the Celtic Cross have been exposed to and are ex- pounding on the circles. Visitors, in- cluding Wingfield and Haddington, in- frequently report the presence of \"a high-pitched trilling sound,\" and several have recorded anomalies and malfunc- tions on electronic devices. Others claim blue and red flashes of light, translucent orange spheres and other optical effects. This suggests there are transients all across the electromagnetic spectrum. Up to this point there is not much debate on the data collection methods, but what follows is a bit more con- troversial. Wingfield and Haddington reflect the most popular mystical inter- pretations, such as those advanced in The Crop Circle Enigma, edited by Ralph Noyes. This must-read book can be likened to Jacques Vallee's Passport to Magonia, which inextricably linked the UFO phenomenon with a long history of folklore and fortean events. In the same manner, the current rage in England is to link the crop circles to the Celtic fairy faith, ancient tumuli, neolithic religions, channeling, dows- ing, a variety of present-day super- natural events and of course UFOs. Celtic Folklore The Fairy Faith so popular in the British Isles brings to mind the elusive little fairies that paint the flowers, dance Figure 2. Typical Dumbbell Pattern Compared to the Hindu Vajra. in the moonlight and create mischief in the cottage kitchen. Less well known are the reports of time travel, circles in the grass known as fairy rings, and the offerings of (curiously) wheat cakes from the Good People. In any case the crop circles began to be linked to some of the rich folklore of the area. The Good People are known by other names, such as leprechauns, the Little People, Gnomes, etc. There was even a recent report of a small man with bright red hair and beard seen perched high in a tree near a crop formation. The red- haired dwarf is found both in Celtic myths and the UFO phenomenon. As the simple circles evolved, one of the first inferred symbols was the quin- cunx (Figure 1-a without the bottom circle). This was followed by the long cross (Figure 1-a), and became labeled the Celtic Cross (Figure 1-b). This is just one example of why Wingfield and Haddington feel there is \"very distinctly a spiritual connection.\" If this symbol does in fact correspond to the Celtic Cross, then there is a clear link with age-old beliefs. Stones & Tumuli Stonehenge is the most pouplar of an- cient stone ceremonial circles. Quite a large number of these monuments are scattered throughout the British Isles and northern France, but the heaviest concentration is in the south and west of England, exactly where the agriglyphs are found in such abun- dance. Again, these sites have historical and spiritual significance, and the cor- relation is seen as significant by some cereologists. Silbury Hill is an earthen pyramid estimated to be at least 2600 years old, with a rich history of religious and mythical connotations. According to Wingfield, over 40 formations have ap- peared in the immediate proximity of this artificial mound. Another more re- cent monument is the White Horse of Uffington, \"a symbol of the gateway be- tween the physical and the spiritual worlds.\" Several pictograms have been found that conspicuously align with Silbury Hill and the White Horse. MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 278 June 1991"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Though the source is unknown, many people report the presence of an energy inside the ancient tumuli and the pre- sent crop circles. Unfortunately, reac- tions vary widely across the spectrum. Most report a sense of awe, some a feel- ing of exhilaration. Yet others ex- perience nausea and even blackouts. Pat Delgado (Crop Circles, the Latest Evidence) tells how his dog refused to enter the circle, but Wingfield reports on a dog that had no adverse reaction, and actually started eating the crop once inside the circle! Stonehenge has been found to be an ingenious astronomical calendar, and the layout of its stones is remarkably similar to some of the agriglyphs. Whether the modern formations have astronomical significance seems to have less urgency than the idea that there is intelligence behind them. Religions The already mentioned Celtic cross is not the only religious symbol seen in the crop circles. The quincunx, for instance, may be associated with the Hindu god Shiva Shakti (destroyer of worlds). A \"swastika\" formation has also been identified and appears on the cover of The Crop Circle Enigma. This of course predates Hitler, and is taken to mean \"the totality of universe\" ac- cording to Wingfield, or in later English simply good luck. Also commonly found are \"dumbbell\" figures, two circles of slightly different diameters connected by a central shaft (Figure 2). This has been likened to the Hindu \"Va- jra,\" a tool used for rituals and initia- tions. The Vajra symbolizes the un- breakable. For further reading see \"The Year of the Vajra\" by John Haddington in Global Link Up, Autumn 1990. Some of the crop circle patterns re- quire a moderate stretch of the imagina- tion in order to equate them with the more traditional symbols referred to here. Wingfield cautions however that these are \"mystical symbols, not in- tellectual symbols - they speak to us through the subconscious.\" Some of the patterns, he reports, are also known to the Navajo Indians, and can be seen in Indian sand paintings. Ancient stone sites, symbols from a variety of antique faiths, and the general atmosphere that something supernatural is occurring all lead to the conclusion that this is a religious phenomenon. There is an undercurrent that this mystery is not just an awakening, but a re-awakening. \"Many people are coming to visit,\" Haddington notes. \"They don't know why they come, but they know they absolutely have to be there.\" Channeling Channeling is one of those tools that tends to obscure or clarify your com- prehension of crop circles, depending on your faith. And faith it seems, plays a primary role here, as we delve deeper into the occult sciences. Any psy- chologist will tell you that you will see and perceive what you want to see, what you are motivated to see, and what your mental makeup tells you is possi- ble. My mission here is to relate what Wingfield and Haddington report, and what's written in the literature. With that caveat, let's move on. Wingfield and other researchers have used channelers to gain information on the circles. One claimed they are be- ing made by \"The Shining Ones,\" a group of angelic sages that built Silbury Hill 4500 years ago. They disappeared in the Neolithic period, when man began to lose his spiritual connection with the earth, and are returning now to help in the upcoming transition. For further reference see \"Cairns and Crop Circles\" by Michael Poynder, Kindred Spirit magazine, Vol. 2, No. 1, Winter 1990. Another feels the crop circles are the result of an exercise of the collec- tive consciousness of mankind. The collective consciousness is a concept that all of mankind, or all living organisms, share a common mental connection, a theory championed by noted psychiatrist Carl Jung. Other psychics have been successful with predicting the date and time of future circles. At least partially suc- cessful anyway, as one predicted the place, but the timing was off by a few weeks. Several have predicted an in- crease in the complexity of the pic- tograms in 1991, and we'll have to wait to see if that proves to be true. Reports that the phenomenon is continuing in 1991 have now been received. There are also psychic suggestions that the small \"grapeshot\" circles found near many larger formations may represent astro- nomical constellations. Dowsing Dowsing is another of those dis- ciplines that is held suspect by those who worship the god of Western Science. Nevertheless, dowsing plays a major role in crop circle geomancy. Wingfield, Haddington and just about all the newsletters out of England refer frequently to dowsable ley lines. Stonehenge and many of the tumuli have strong dowsable lines, and many of the pictograms reportedly have dowsable lines along the major and minor axis. Haddington reports that the ley lines \"seem to be increasing in energy, almost like there's a global network, like a nervous system\" is responsible. Gaia, the living Earth, and Ceres, the goddess of corn are also linked to the crop circles. Some dowsers claim there is another dimension to the glyphs, that they can measure a force above the ground for many feet into the air above the pattern in the cereal. Present Day Events The crop circles are now appearing in other countries. Many New Age disciples feel the pictograms are just one more manifestation of a global, spiritual change that is evolving all over the world, with links to such seemingly diverse events as the falling of the Berlin wall, the environmental move- ment, and the popularity of vegetarianism. Another of the mysteries presently occurring is the appearance of the Blessed Virgin Mary (BVM) in a little hamlet in central Yugoslavia, the town of Medjugorje. With remarkable parallels to the BVM appearances at Fatima, several children have been receiving messages urging prayer and fasting.

Right: drawing from unidentified photograph from Haddington display. (Not to scale.) Sister Mary Michael, has studied both the events at Medjugorje and the crop circles. She feels the markings are something evil. Most other researchers disagree. One of the Medjugorje predictions is that the BVM will leave a permanent mark on the earth on June 6, 1991. One particularly symbolic pictogram (con- taining many linked patterns) appeared on April 6, 1990. Haddington suggests this pictogram may be a precursor for the June 1991 event. Likewise, there are a series of holes in the earth appearing in Switzerland. The holes may be related to crop circles, as there are no footprints around, yet many cubic yards of soil are removed without a trace of disturbance to the surrounding ground. There is no spilled dirt, and the evacuations occur unseen in the middle of the night. UFOs The favored refrain among mystical- minded researchers is that UFOs are MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 278 June 1991"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"responsible for the crop circles, or more broadly, the same force responsible for crop circles is behind UFO exper- iences. There are a variety of eye- witness accounts of red glowing orbs, blue flashes of light, large translucent orange spheres and silvery metallic globes sited in the fields. There is a record of a Mr. Bryce Bond in the Spring 1991 Cerealogist of how he was in a field when he felt paralyzed, then received a communication: \"Be at peace. We mean no harm. You are standing in the middle of our craft. We are not of your dimension.\" Wingfield and Haddington tell of how one night they were standing watch for crop circles. It was about 3:00 a.m., and there were 12 people in the group, including a psychic. They heard a high- pitched \"trilling sound.\" The sound seemed difficult to localize, but at one point appeared to be just outside of the crop formation they were standing in. Haddington felt there was \"a presence\" in the area. The psychic woman pleaded \"If you can hear us, stop.\" The trilling noise immediately stopped, then re- sumed again. Another witness, view- ing from a point some distance away, claims he saw a UFO above the group at the time of the noise, but those in the group saw nothing unusual. Haddington meanwhile witnessed a most strange event when looking into the night - several hundred black rods seemed to be dancing among the stalks. Others in the group confirm this account. Another witness, Ron Jones, also ex- perienced the trilling noise. One night he heard the sound in his home. He was immediately transported to a field, where he saw a whirl of lights. Then, just as quickly, he found himself back in his own bed. All of these experiences smack of the UFO phenomenon, in- cluding reports of high strangeness. George Wingfield advises us to keep an open mind. He hints that certain pic- tograms may actually be drawings of entities, such as those from the Celtic myths. Figure 3 shows two examples. Conclusion During the question-and-answer period after the lecture George The above formation appeared at Barn Field, Cheesefoot Head, near Win- chester, Wiltshire, on August 11, 1990. Photo by Busty Taylor, again from Enigma and the postcard series. Wingfield was asked what he thought the significance was of these crop circles. He responded that they may signal the next stage in the evolution of man. He urged those present to come to England and visit the circles. \"It's an experience that cannot be described in words.\" You must participate. Whether you are mystical-minded or grounded in academic science, the crop circles prove to be an ongoing enigma. Since the circles are repeating, have measurable electromagnetic and visual anomalies, and seem to contain a sym- bolic message, this mystery may be a fertile field (pardon the pun) to in- vestigate.

Aggen, Jr. A frequent Journal contributor, Aggen is a State Section Director who lives in Kansas City. A stronomers and astrophysicists /\\ have estimated the number of A. ^advanced technological civiliza- tions in our galaxy at between one million to 10 million inhabited worlds. Most scientists have assumed that G- class stars like our own sun offer the best possibilities for the evolution of life and intelligence. This assumption may be in error, however, if researchers such as K.A. Ehricke, F.J. Dyson, F.D. Drake, I.S. Shklovsky and Su-Shu Huang are correct. According to these scientists different classes of stars can act as \"accelerators\" or \"brakes\" on the evolution of planetary life. G-class stars may not be the most effective \"in- cubators\" of life; other classes of stars may provide more optimal conditions. 1 Solar radiation appears to play a ma- jor role in affecting those factors which drive evolution. The evolution of life is dependent on the rate of favorable mutational changes and radical \"leaps\" in development triggered by solar radia- tion and specific environmental factors. This interaction is readily evident on our own planet. The rate of mutation has been more rapid on the land and slower and more predictable in the oceans. Sea life has been more insulated from solar radiation and less subject to environmental upheavals. As a result, although sea-based Cetacean in- telligence is theoretically equal to our own, the development of manipulative organs and technology has given man the ability to dominate all other forms of life on Earth. A higher rate of mutation may result when life in its early stages is subjected to highly energetic solar radiation. This in turn would speed up evolution and hasten the emergence of higher forms of life. The radiation-rich environments of planets in F-class star systems would encourage mutations and \"drive\" evolu- tion. Scientific studies have shown that an increase in the amount of \"hard\" ra- diation reaching the Earth's surface would increase the incidence of mutation from about 0.1% at present to over 50%! Our sun and most of the stars in the outer rim of our galaxy are so-called \"Population I\" stars - young blue stars rich in the heavier elements and metals. These stars have a greater chance of possessing life-bearing planets than the older, mainly red \"Population n\" stars located in the nucleus of the galaxy. Population I stars in the F5 to K5 range (6600-3900° K) offer the best prospects for life. F-class stars have stable lifetimes of 4 to 6 billion years com- pared to 11 to 17 billion years for G- class stars. F-class stars are hotter in temperature and slightly larger than G- class stars. On Earth, higher surface temperatures have been shown to ac- celerate metabolic processes and the rate of mutation. Warmer oceans, for example, tend to maximize the effects of mutation on water-based organisms. On F-class planets the amount of high- energy solar radiation reaching the sur- face would also increase the probabili- ty of climatic change - another driver of evolution. Intelligent life may evolve faster on such planets as compared to planets in the cooler, G, K and M-class star systems. 2 Intelligent life evolving on a planet in an F-class star system would in- evitably be forced to develop interstellar travel or face the prospect of being destroyed when their star swelled into a Giant. It would be necessary for F- class civilizations to improvise star- flight capability earlier (or faster) than G, K or M-class civilizations in order to insure their survival. If this hypothesis is correct, a large number of star-faring alien races may come from F-class star systems. L ife may have a much better chance of gaining a \"foothold\" 'in F-class star systems than in a system such as ours. F-class stars have a much larger habitability zone or \"ecosphere\" than G, K or M-class stars. If our sun suddenly became an F-class star the \"temperate\" life zone that Earth occupies would be shifted farther out to the gas giants such as Jupiter and Saturn and the inner planets would become too hot to sustain life. If the size and distance relation of the planets in our system is typical, planets within the ecosphere of an F-class star could be somewhat larger than the \"ter- restrial\" planets such as Earth. They might resemble planets such as Jupiter and Saturn with their huge gaseous at- mospheres boiled off leaving solid rocky cores; they would be about 30% to 260% more massive than Earth. Conversely, if the size and distance con- straints of our system are not typical, such planets would have to be at the proper distance from their sun and no more than 30% larger or 14% smaller than Earth to maintain the optimum conditions for life. 3 ' 4 There are 130 to 200 billion stars in our galaxy; of this number about 18% are F-class stars and 14% are G-class stars. If we eliminate the three out of four F-class stars thought to be white dwarfs or giants, we are left with a potential galactic population of 6 to 9 billion F-class stars that may possess promising planetary systems. If we fur- ther reduce this number by consider- ing only those F-class stars in the most favorable spectral sub-classes (F5 - F9), we arrive at an estimate of 3.4 to 5.2 billion F-class star systems that may harbor life in various stages of evolu- tion. In addition, many or most F-class star systems may contain more than one inhabitable planet because of their larger ecospheres. The existence of more than one inhabited planet in such a system would provide a powerful in- centive for the early development of spaceflight technology and in- terplanetary travel. By most conser- vative estimates, the number of ad- MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 278 June 1991"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"vanced alien civilizations in these systems could range from several hun- dred thousand to several million. 5 One of the major arguments against finding intelligent life in F-class star systems is the short lifetime of F-class stars. This criticism is based on the relatively long lifetimes of G-class stars like our own sun. Some scientists con- tend that stars must remain stable on the \"Main Sequence\" for longer than four to six billion years for sentient life to evolve from primitive multicellular organisms. This assertion, however, is based on the evolutionary history of our own planet and the statistical observa- tion of much less than 1% of galactic stars; the solitary example of Earth may not be typical for the rest of the galaxy. There are no valid scientific reasons why life cannot evolve and progress to an advanced technological stage in less than four billion years. 6>7 In conclusion, we can extrapolate that life-bearing planets in F-class star systems will most likely have less diverse forms of life than planets in G- class systems owing to the relatively high amounts of solar radiation reaching the surface. Only the fittest forms of life would survive on planets of F-class stars. Such lifeforms, in- telligent and otherwise, would probably be very resistant to various types of energetic radiation, high levels of at- mospheric ionization and changing en- vironmental conditions. The hotter en- vironments and higher surface gravities possible on planets within the ecospheres of F-class stars would tend to produce smaller lifeforms with higher metabolic rates, tougher and more leathery (or lizard-like) skins and eyes adapted to the more intense blue light spectrum produced by F-class stars. Intelligent life located on planets within the inner ecospheres of F-class stars may be adapted to dry, desert-like surface conditions. Faced with such harsh environments, an intelligent species might elect to live most of the time in underground dwellings rather than stay on the surface. Eventually, however, all advanced forms of life on F-class planets may be forced to move underground as their sun enters the in- To survive, the inhabitants of these systems would have to abandon their home planets and migrate to planets farther out in their solar systems, or travel to other stars in search of a new home. itial stages of expansion into a Giant. Although this period of stellar expan- sion would take several million years, the detrimental effects on planetary en- vironments would be felt much earlier. To survive, the inhabitants of these systems would have to abandon their home planets and migrate to planets far- ther out in their solar systems (if they exist), or travel to other stars in search of a new home. In the final analysis, the hypothetical inhabitants of certain F-class star systems may closely resemble the ubi- quitous \"gray aliens\" described in ufological literature, i.e., small beings with reptilian-like skin and large, black insect-like eyes. It is also interesting to note the unusual number of cases in which the \"grays\" and other aliens have stated or inferred that they come from a dying sun or solar system. References 1. Lunan, Ducan.

Flying a Vampire jet on the training flight were Lieutenants Prio Jrence and Raymond Gallibert who were in constant radio communication with the tower at Orange Field. In an interview, Lt. Prio declared: \"We were flying in an absolutely cloudless sky when right over Orange we perceived an object of bright metallic appearance at an altitude of between 1600 and 1700 feet. The object was circular and ap- peared to be of aluminum and was perfectly motionless. Naturally in- terested, we made toward it, the disc 'see-sawed' for a moment and then took off at a rapidly increasing speed. We chased it as far as Aspes-sur-Buech without being able to catch up, the climbing speed of our Vampire being inadequate. After we had pursued it for six minutes, the object disappeared, still climbing at a speed of about 600 miles per hour.\" (Source: UPOs: A History 1951) 1966 • State Police and Air Force in- telligence officers joined forces in pro- bing the story of a New Bedford, Massachusetts motorist who said his car was \"buzzed\" at treetop level by a UFO on the llth. The episode occurred at 3:45 a.m. in suburban Westport. \"An object whose illumination seemed to vary between an amber-green and a bluish-yellow, came up from behind and I gradually became aware of it hovering over my car,\" Ronald Petit said. \"Then it moved ahead and I could see it quite clearly. I slowed my car and the object appeared to stop. I drove to within about 100 feet, stopped, got out and took a close look.\" Petit said he stared at the \"thing\" for at least two minutes before leaping back into the safety of his car. \"When I slammed the door,\" he said, \"the glowing object tilted to an approximate 45-degree angle and went straight up until it disap- peared.\" (Source: Flying Saucer Review — Sept.-Oct. 1966) • Mrs. Gordon M. Avery, of Mt. Sunapee, New Hampshire, said she saw a white-oval-shaped object about 4 a.m. on the 16th while investigating the source of a brilliant light illuminating her living room. To the east, she saw the craft apparently hovering a few feet above the utility wires. As she watched, a jagged extension protruded from the object and seemed to touch the wires. It had no apparent physical effect. After about five minutes, the rod retracted and the craft began moving northeast, accelerating and disappearing over a mountain at high speed. (Source: The UFO Investigator — Oct.-Nov. 1966) • Julian Sandoval, an Apollo Space Project engineer, a pilot and former Air Force navigator, spotted a large UFO over Placitas, New Mexico — about 18 miles north of Albuquerque — about 3:45 p.m. on the 23rd, and watched it for about an hour and a half. Sandoval said the craft appeared to be stationary at about 12,000 feet, was about 300 feet long, that its main body had a blunt end and was \"incandescent\" like a regular light bulb. \"It's like nothing we have,\" Sandoval said. The object finally disap- peared in a northeasterly direction after making a vertical climb and increasing its speed to about six Machs (six times the speed of sound). Sandoval had logged 7000 hours of flying time, was employed by North American Aviation and was in charge of electrical power and environmental control with the Apollo Project.

Stevens, Jr., was on patrol about 3:30 a.m. on the 24th, when he noticed some lights hanging low in the sky. He approached to investigate and observed a light-colored, dirigible- shaped craft with a string of alternating yellow and white lights around the edge. When he tried to get close, the object started moving away, stopping until he caught up, then moving again. Stevens was soon chasing the craft at more than 100 miles per hour along the Richmond-Henrico Turnpike. The UFO kept ahead of him, following every twist and turn of the road. \"I trailed it across the Chickahominy River into Hanover County about six miles,\" Stevens said. \"Out in Hanover it kind of stopped for a little bit, then went into a high speed vertical climb. It didn't just disappear all of a sudden, it climbed out of sight.\" The pursuit had lasted about 15 minutes.

After watching it for about 10 minutes, it flared up very bright and started mov- ing toward the ship. It stopped and hovered directly above the ship. The light soon became a huge disc-shaped object (\"bigger than the 465-foot ship\") which hovered silently over the ship for several minutes. Rasmussen described the craft as having a solid center — possibly metal — with a pulsating white light. \"The outer rim or halo seemed to be some sort of force field. It was semi-transparent, as I could see stars through it.\" Three other long-time seamen, including the ship's captain, also saw the object. They estimated the height above the ship to be around 10,000 feet and the diameter of the craft (the solid portion) to be about 600 to MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 278 June 1991"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"700 feet.

I drew my curtain a little to peep out and I saw what I took to be three men chatting on the beach. I thought it must be some chaps cleaning fish. Then I said to myself 'not at 3 a.m.' Outside the gate is a pine tree and through the big branch of the pine shone a very bright red light which hovered slightly. The figures seemed to be shrouded in a grey mist. A little later a silver strip appeared on the water and appeared to light the way back for the men to get on the red ball. As I watched, the silver strip disap- peared and the red ball moved off ...\" (Source: The Truth — Auckland, New Zealand —6/15/71) 1976 • Mrs. Nancy Shuken and Mrs. Zelda Segall saw what they described as a \"dirigible-shaped object\" that ap- peared to hover over Segall's home in Palm Springs, California, about 9:30 p.m. on the ninth. \"We were in Zelda's backyard when we looked up and saw it,\" Mrs. Shuken said. \"It was huge and bright.\" Mrs. Segall said she rushed to find her camera, but when she tried to take a picture of the object, the flash refused to work. \"What was really strange,\" she added, \"was that when I took a picture of something else, the darn thing worked. But when I tried taking a picture of the object, nothing.\" Both women said the camera flash was not the only electrical device that wouldn't operate while the object was \"hovering\" over the house. The telephone, radio and television also went on the blink. The house lights, however, presented no problem. \"What was even stranger,\" Mrs. Segall said, \"was after we saw the thing disappear, all this equipment worked. I'll tell you, we were scared out of our wits.\" At least six other residents reported see- ing the object. (Source The Desert Sun — Palm Springs, CA — 6/12/76) • On the 13th, Manual Gomez, a rancher in Dulce, New Mexico, reported that he discovered one of his cows mutilated in the middle of a pasture — with several organs removed \"with a sharp instrument.\" Gomez returned the following day with State Police and a county livestock inspec- tor, only to find additional parts of the animal apparently also surgically removed. A subsequent investigation of the area reportedly revealed triangular tracks in a tripod pattern near the car- cass which, according to a scientific consultant, had radiation levels twice the normal background level. No other tracks, including human footprints or tire tracks, could be identified. The State Police also discovered a \"sticky substance,\" yellow in color, on some plants in the immediate area near the tripod tracks, adding that some of the plants appeared to be scorched and dy- ing. Wild predators would not approach the remains of the cow for at least 72 hours after the discovery. A calf the cow had been nursing was also missing. On the same evening the cow was discovered, a UFO was reported over Dulce. (Source: Signal & Saugus Enterprise — Newhall, CA — 7/19/76) • An enormous UFO — the height of a three-story building — seen hovering over the Canary Islands on the 22nd left scientists, military authorities and dozens of other witnesses completely dumbfounded. Two of the witnesses, a respected medical doctor and his driver, saw within the globe-shaped transparent object two \"extremely tall\" figures with \"large, bright eyes\" — and ran from the object in terror. And three astronomers watched in stunned amazement as the \"giant, brilliant sphere with a swirling center\" streaked directly toward their observatory. At about 10:30 p.m. the physician, Dr. Francisco Julio Padron, was being driven to Gaidar, a town on the northwest coast of Grand Canary Island. As the car rounded a curve, the strange sphere was seen some 60 yards off the road. \"It was very large, about the size of a three-story building, and as perfectly round as if drawn by a com- pass,\" Dr. Padron said. \"It was of a grayish-blue color, but transparent — we could see the stars right through it. It was suspended a few feet above the ground. \"There were two figures toward the center of the sphere. They were well over six feet tall. They were either dressed in brilliant red or red in color. Their faces were flesh colored and human in appearance. I could not see any ears because they wore a kind of clothlike helmet or turban on their heads. Their head gave off a glow, like a halo or aura. They had pointed, wing- like appendages on the end of their arms that they moved slowly like hands. They seemed intent on some sort of control panel. Suddenly the car radio went dead and we felt a terrible cold- ness. The object began to lift off— and seemed to be growing steadily larger as it rose.\" Shocked and frightened by what they'd seen, they brought the car to a screeching halt — and sought refuge in the nearby farmhouse of Paco Rodriguez. Just before Dr. Padron and the driver knocked at his front door, Rodriguez recalled that his TV set suddenly and mysteriously went dead. When the farmer let the men in, they all rushed to the window. \"We could see the ob- ject clearly — a bright bluish sphere with two red objects inside that looked like human forms. I dived to the floor, covered my head with my arms and yelled to my wife to do the same. We stayed there until the doctor told us it had gone away.\" The driver, Francisco Esteves, declared: \"I also saw the two figures. I could see that they had very bright, large eyes. I can swear that this was something out of this world. My nerves are shattered — I'll never forget this as long as I live.\" Another witness was architectural draftsman Domingo Alamo, who was in a friend's house on a mountain near Gaidar. Their wives, coming in from outside, explained there was something \"very strange in the sky ; We ran to the roof and were astonished to see a MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 278 June 1991"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"perfectly round, transparent sphere in the center of which was a sort of bent, long shape of a bright red color,\" Alamo said. \"It was stationary, about the height of the church spires nearby. It seemed to expand gradually, always in a perfect circle. We had it in view for about 30 minutes, while it seemed to recede until there was just a huge, white circle in the sky.\" Dr. Francisco Sanchez, director of the Astrophysical Observatory on Monte Izana, Canary Islands, said that several scientists at the observatory saw the object with their naked eyes, but were unable to track it with their telescopes. \"It was below the line of sight of our telescope,\" he explained. \"The astronomers reported it had the form of a huge sphere and was very brilliant. It was definitely not a planet, a balloon or smoke. I have no scien- tific explanation for it.\" Dr. Fernando Bello, one of three astronomers at the observatory that night remembered, \"All of us saw the UFO — a giant, brilliant sphere with a swirling center shaped like a snail. It seemed to be headed straight toward the observatory! The object continued to approach un- til it paused for just a moment, made an abrupt 90-degree right turn and took off like a streak of light. We had it under observation for three to five minutes.\" (Source: National Enquirer - 9/28/76) The UFO Press North American Crop Circles and Related Physical Traces in 1990 By Chris Rutkowski et al. Released February 1991 by the North American Institute for Crop Circle Research. 40 pp. Reviewed by Michael Chorost C hris Rutkowski and his seven colleagues have produced the kind of report cereologists ache to see: a tabular list of 1990 crop circles in North America, with an analysis of the data. Their report is the first of its kind, since previous studies have limited themselves either to photographic documentation or to promoting one theory over another. As the first collec- tion of locations, dates, dimensions, and other data produced on either side of the Atlantic, this study has great value. Its authors, however, were beset by considerable problems, which are in- evitably passed on to the reader. One was the problem of cobbling together usable data from diverse sources of varying completeness and reliability. Another was the challenge of deciding how to organize it, since no one knows which data structure will best bring buried truths to the surface. Still another was the sheer unprecedented nature of what they were doing, since there were no successful analyses to emulate, no failed analyses to learn from. In such a situation, unorganized tables of numbers take on an aspect of terror. They can be sorted in infinite ways, yet only a few are likely to lead to the truth. One might walk across Antarctica blind- folded with greater confidence. This terror may help account for why no one has published and attempted to analyze tables of data, even though the circles have been the focus of sustained public attention for at least four years. Rutkowski and his colleagues, then, are to be commended for the ambition and bravery of this first attempt. The report's raw data are presented twice, in two different forms: by ele- ment, and by formation. In the first set of raw data, the authors list each ele- ment of a formation separately, so that, for example, a group of ten circles found in Warsaw, Indiana, is listed as ten separate elements. The elements are recorded in a dense table of 86 \"unusual ground markings\" (UGMs) listed by date, location, type (flattened circle, burned circle, ring, etc.,), cir- cle diameters, direction of swirl, crop type, associated UFO sightings, and whether samples were taken and tests performed. Dates range from March to October 1990; locations span the con- tinent, from Pennsylvania to British Columbia, with a preponderance in the American Midwest and in Manitoba and Saskatchewan. Diameters range from 1.7m (Warsaw, Indiana) to 38m (Odessa, Missouri). Samples and tests are noted but the results are not specified. Hopefully, future reports will have more to say on that score. Unfortunately, the first data set's mode of organization is not followed consistently. For example, a formation in Leola, SD, which consisted of four separate elements (a \"reverse question mark\" and three rectangles) is listed as only one element. This probably hap- pened because the table was set up to record only circle diameters and ring widths. Thus it couldn't accommodate any other kind of element, such as rec- tangles or partial arcs. For example, a formation in Northside, Saskatchewan, is described as a circle with four spokes and two rings, with another circle 125m away, yet the data set lists just the two rings. It appears that the numerical-tabular format created more headaches for Rutkowski and his colleagues than it solved, because it assumed more uniformity than was the case, and used an awkward mode of representation. The circles are diverse and spatially complex objects which resist simple numerical representation. It would seem more sensible to tabulate them visually, in annotated diagrams. This would lead one to record formations on a case-by-case basis, creating new data categories as appropriate, rather than trying to define all of the relevant data categories in advance. One can envision scanning formations into a HyperCard database and annotating the dimen- sions, with fields for location, date and so forth. Colin Andrews has made a start in this direction with his com- puterized visual catalogue, which should be reproduced as an appendix to my article in the proceedings of the 1991 MUFON conference in Chicago. MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 278 June 1991"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"Following leads like this, we can develop more flexible and productive ways to represent our knowledge. The other set of raw data is the more immediately useful one, because it lists whole formations, not elements. It lists 45 formations by date, location and brief verbal description. About 30 are English-style crop circles; the rest are circular burns, areas of flattened and burned crops, areas of missing vegeta- tion, holes, etchings in dry soil, and patches of stunted growth (probably fairy rings, which are natural phenomena). Since no one knows whether and how these diverse phenomena are separable, Rutkowski et al reasonably chose to lump them all together. The reliability of the documentation is obviously uneven. Some formations have been well documented by the authors themselves, such as a 3.6m dia. circle surrounded by a 7.5m dia. ring in Tweedsmuir, Saskatchewan, and an elliptical formation measuring 7.8 by 7.6m in Petersfield, Manitoba. Others are reported on little more than hear- say. For example, one item reads mere- ly, \"It was claimed that a crop circle was discovered near this town\" and lists the source as a TV station. This is no fault of the authors, who clearly de- cided that it was better to risk report- ing rumor than to leave out potential truth. Since sources are listed, it is usually possible for the reader to decide how much weight to give each report. T he two sets of data are listed in the back of the report. In the front, Rutkowski et al attempt a basic analysis of the data. They pre- sent five tables breaking the data down in different ways: circle type versus country, circle type versus direction of swirl, circle type versus crop, country versus crop, and country versus direc- tion of swirl. Perhaps the most in- teresting result is that grass elements predominated over wheat elements in the U.S. (46 grass elements vs. two wheat ones), but the reverse held in Canada: 16 wheat elements vs. four grass ones. Other interesting results are that concentric rings almost always formed in wheat (nine in wheat vs. one in grass) and that burned and flattened circles almost always happened in grass (nine in grass vs. one in wheat.) One could guess that grass is more suscep- tible to burning than wheat. One must view these findings with caution, however, because of the incompleteness of the data, the distortions introduced by counting elements rather than for- mations, and the low total numbers in- volved. They may make more (or less) sense when compared to English data, if and when the latter become available, and in the light of future findings. Rutkowski is appropriately cautious, writing, \"There was no evident trend in any characteristic of the UGMs.\" This might even seem overcautious, in light of the numbers cited above, but he clearly has the problematic nature of the data uppermost in mind. Some minimal conclusions can be drawn, however. For example, it seems evident that grass crop circles happen much more often in the U.S. than in England. This is easily explained by the fact that England is so intensively cultivated that there is very little tall grassland left. However, it is more dif- ficult to explain why so few grass circles were reported in Canada, a country with abdundant grassland, relative to the United States. Perhaps there are fewer people in Canada to discover circles in grassland far from population centers. In addition, the authors note that the peculiar effects reported in English crop circles, such as strange noises and flashes of light, have not been noticed in North American formations. Nor do they exhibit the same level of complex- ity seen in England (ringed and spoked circles seems to be the maximum). Thus, as a sort of negative conclusion, it remains unclear whether the 45 cases listed belong to one phenomenon or several, and whether the 30 crop circles within that set are truly identifiable with the English version of the phenomenon. In an intelligent and cautious discus- sion, Rutkowski analyzes the debate about the cause of the circles. He breaks the theories down into four types: ex- traterrestrials, wind phenomena, hoaxes and \"other.\" The first three are certainly the best-known. \"Other\" sub- sumes less popular theories, such as military activity and mating hedgehogs. However, there are more catagories than Rutkowski notes. Some people in the CCCS (Centre for Crop Circle Studies) subscribe to the theory that \"earth energies\" create the crop circles. Richard Andrews, a professional dowser, is perhaps the best-known of these theorists. It is certainly not clear (to me, anyhow) what \"earth energies\" are, nor how they could create the com- plex forms we have seen, though Rupert Sheldrake's theory of morphogenetic fields and James Lovelock's \"Gaia\" theory of planetary intelligence have both been invoked as explanatory fac- tors. In addition, there are significant splits within the theoretical camps: for example, Terence Meaden has accepted that the more complex formations are meteorological in nature, while his followers Paul Fuller and Jenny Randies still think most or all of them must be hoaxes, with only the simpler forma- tions being \"genuine.\" Rutkowski's main point is that no theory adequately explains the phenom- enon. So far, the data support none of them: \"Statistical studies conducted on the data ... suggest [no] particular uni- fying explanation.\" He notes that only four of the 45 formations have UFO sightings associated with them, and a perusal of the data shows that none of the sightings are clearly of \"nuts and bolts\" spacecraft: two sightings were of glowing lights, the other two go un- specified. Glowing lights fit in just as well with meteorological theories, which presuppose hot, glowing plasma vor- tices, as with ET theories. And yet meteorological theories themselves can explain very little: \"Is Britian's change in weather so incredibly dramatic that hundreds of circles can form in 1990, compared with only a handful a decade ago?\" Rutkowski notes that many factors complicate each theory: winds do cause crop damage, yet crop circles do resem- ble classic \"saucer nests\"; many crop circles have been considered genuine despite their great complexity, yet there have been notorious hoaxes; crop circles may be an effort at communica- tion, yet nobody understands them. MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 278 June 1991"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"And there are, in addition to crop circles, many other kinds of anomalous ground markings. Do they have the same basic cause, or are they caused by entirely unrelated phenomena? No one knows. As George Wingfield astutely writes in The Crop Circle Enigma, the \"ex- otic\" theories tend to fall into two classes: those involving earth mysteries, like earth-energy theories, and those in- voking sky mysteries, like alien- intelligence theories. The English lean toward earth mysteries, whereas Americans tend to favor sky mysteries. At the risk of oversimplifying, one might suggest that the English tend to look to the earth which contains their past, whereas Americans, a spacefar- in'g race, look up to a sky which may hold their future. Perhaps Canadians, being of the New World, yet still Com- monwealth citizens, fall somewhere in between. Certainly the Canadians have shown considerable good sense in this land- mark report. It has significant shortcom- ings, as I have noted, but they are counter-balanced by the pioneering nature of the work.

MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 278 June 1991"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"Letters to the Editor... Dear Editor: We are writing in response to Dr. Maccabee's article in the November 1990 issue of the MUFON Journal. Since we are mentioned in the article, we believe that we are entitled to have our response published under your 50% rule. Since our work on the Walters' case was taken out of context by Mac- cabee, we feel it is necessary to pro- vide the context for the edification of your readers. Last July, we were asked by MUFON to take the lead in the investigation of the reopening of the Walters' case after the UFO model was found in the attic of the Walters' previous residence and a young man, Tommy Smith, made allegations which cast doubt on the authenticity of the case. Prior to that time, we had accepted the authenticity of the case based upon the representa- tions of the previous investigators, who were known to us. We would not have bought six copies of Walters' book for friends and relatives had we entertained serious doubt about the case. Despite our admitted positive bias, we believe that we have been successful in main- taining our objectivity in our work with the case and have followed the evidence to logical conclusions. After weeks of frustrating effort, we arrived at the conclusion that the Walters' photos were probably faked, which was reported to MUFON by telephone on September 9, 1990. Although there is considerable evidence to doubt the credibility of the case, one of the deciding factors for us was our analysis of photos 14 and 19. Using in- formation provided by Walters and the data provided by Maccabee, the \"reflec- tions\" in photos 14 and 19 were shown to be physical impossibilities, i.e. the reflections were not flat on the surface as one would expect, but were elevated as if reflecting off of a raised ramp. With photos 14 and 19 shown to be pro- bable fakes, the other photos which depict images of the same models should be considered to be highly suspect. At that time we consulted with three PhD-level Photo Analysts and a Master's level Analytical Physicist who agreed with our analysis and con- clusions. Dr. Maccabee apparently also agrees with our work, which prompted him to \"reanalyze\" photo 19. We ac- cept this as his repudiation of his earlier analysis and of Walters' description of the alleged event. Careful reading of Maccabee's new analysis and Walters' account of the event show that there are major discrepancies between the two which makes them mutually exclusive. If Maccabee's new scenario is \"possible\" as he claims, then Walters' account is impossible and Dr. Maccabee is \"hoist on his own petard.\" He has effectively impugned his own witness. Additional- ly, Maccabee has failed to address the very similar \"reflection\" of photo 14. His \"possibility\" for photo 19 can not apply to photo 14 since the reflective surfaces and other aspects were much different. Maccabee goes on for several pages in his analysis to conclude that the height of the camera above the road of 4.1 feet agrees \"perfectly\" with his computations, although heights of 3.5 to 5 feet would be reasonable. If you put Walters in his Ford 150 XLT truck, which is \"very high off the ground,\" you will find a camera elevation of 5.4 (+/- 0.2) feet which is outside of the reasonable limits and by itself negates Maccabee's new analysis. A com- parison of a photo re-enactment of Walters taking the \"shot\" and the geography of the scene confirm the above. It is unfortunate that Maccabee did not carry his analysis somewhat farther and compute the comparative reflection intensities within the 125-foot-long reflection which he claims is \"possi- ble.\" Had he done so, and then com- pared the expected variations to those obtained by densitometer measurements of the photographs, he should have con- cluded that his \"possibility\" is actual- ly impossible. We regret the space limitation which precludes us from providing more detail and other evidence which we have gathered regarding this case. Permit us, however, to provide a brief partial listing. 1. Two professional voice stress analyses have been done of the tape recording of the June 15,1990 telephone conversation in which Tommy Smith made allegations about the Walters' photos being hoaxed. The taped material was well suited to the analyses which indicated that Tommy was tell- ing the truth. Allegations by Tommy in- clude that he saw two UFO models in the Walters' home, that he saw Walters photographing UFO models, that Walters had tried to enlist Tommy's help in conducting the hoax, that Walters and/or Hank Boland were responsible for the \"Believer Bill\" and the \"Jane\" photos, that Hank Boland and Walters' wife and son participated in the hoax, and that Walters had described to him how some of the photos were faked. In an interview with us, Tommy recon- firmed the above and further related, among other things, that Walters had told him of hoaxing UFOs using hot air balloons when Walters lived in Costa Rica. 2. Tommy had discussed much of the above with his family back in 1988, which is confirmed by the law partners of Tom Smith Sr. and the Gulf Breeze Chief of Police. The description which Tommy provided of Walters' UFO models at that time fit the model which was found in the attic of Walters' old home. 3. Three of the four lie detector tests that Walters claims to have passed were self-sponsored (i.e. paid for by Walters with no third party supervision) and should be regarded accordingly with skepticism. The fourth, a voice stress analysis, was done by MUFON without Walters' knowledge or consent. The ex- aminer on this test states \"The way the interviews were done and the type of information discussed does not give the examiner the verbal material necessary to be able to say if these individuals are being completely truthful with the in- terviewer.\" Additionally, Walters failed to keep the appointment for a MUFON sponsored polygraph test and has adamantly refused to take any spon- sored tests ever since. 4. The model found in the attic is made of styrofoam plates with the center section made from one of MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 278 June 1991"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"Walters' house plans. On page 28 of Walters' book he described the UFO as having \"horizontal lines going around the main body.\" The model has 14 horizontal lines drawn around its main body which are not shown in Walters' drawings or photos. Evidence of responsibility for the model points to Walters, in that he knew of the horizon- tal lines, had access to his house plans and access to the home until the Menzers moved in during November 1989. Proof has not emerged that anyone else possessed these three re- quisites. Continuing arguments about which house plan was used, etc., are interesting, but ancillary to the primary focus. 5. Mark Curtis of WEAR-TV con- ducted a demonstration to show the feasibility of faking photo 19 with dou- ble exposure photography which was based upon Tommy Smith's informa- tion. Many people believe that he was successful despite a lengthy letter to the editor from Maccabee attempting to debunk it. Basically, Maccabee tried to show that photo 19 was not duplicated exactly while ignoring the fact that feasibility was amply shown. 6. Interviews with the young people who had attended parties in the Walters' home and others tend to confirm our conclusions. 7. Long before the alleged onset of Walters' UFO photography on November 11, 1987, Walters told Mr. and Mrs. Peter Neumann of Gulf Breeze that he had used double- exposure photography to amuse the young people who attended functions and parties in his home. There is much more, including amplification and documentation, for which we do not now have the space, but intend to include in our final report. — Carol and Rex Salisberry Navarre Beach, FL Dear Editor: Thank you for your very fair - in- deed, generous - review of The Crop Circle Enigma in your March issue. You rightly draw attention to two omis- sions: apart from George Wingfield's article the book says little about a possi- ble UFO connection\"; and we were vir- tually silent about what might be hap- pening, physiologically, to the crops. Perhaps I may comment. When we went to press last August (a bare 100 days after setting up the Centre for Crop Circle Studies) the on- ly material available on crop effects was the information which had been published by a holistic medicine firm in Stroud. Although Pat Delgado and Colin Andrews saw fit to reproduce this material in Crop Circles: The Latest Evidence - reviewed by Jerold R. Johnson in your March issue — I ad- vised my publisher that we should not make use of it ourselves. I share Jerold R. Johnson's view that it falls far short of meeting acceptable scientific stan- dards. It has also been used as the basis for wildly speculative claims about the supposedly deleterious or beneficial ef- fect of the disturbed crops on human consumers. There is at present no shred of acceptable evidence for this, one way or the other. CCCS is in no doubt, however, that we need to find out whether physi- ological changes in the crop do in fact take place when circles form. One of the research panels we have set up is devoting itself entirely to this question, using carefully controlled samples and working with scientifically qualified in- stitutions. As soon as we have proper- ly founded results we shall publish them. The \"UFO connection\" ... ? At pre- sent CCCS can't go further than to say that luminous and audible phenomena occurring in the low atmosphere have not infrequently been associated with the formation of crop circles. And there have been other oddities of the kind familiar to ufologists over the past 40 years. Reports are accumulating; they are being carefully assessed. But there is a long way to go before we can be sure of having more than a very in- teresting and suggestive (though somewhat patchy) correlation. At pre- sent CCCS has no wish to plunge into the murky debate about what UFOs may or may not be! But I suspect that we shall have a worthwhile contribu- tion to make to ufology when our researches have been carried further. Findings will be published as soon as we feel reasonably confident about our evidence. — Ralph Noyes Hon. Secretary, CCCS We certainly appreciate your restraint in regard to the rather dubious evidence submitted by the Stroud laboratory to the effect that the crystalline energy structure, orsomesuch, of the plants in- side a forming crop circle is somewhat altered when compared to outside con- trols. Even so, what we were looking for in the review, and we may not have been crystal clear ourselves, was a background into the status of agricul- tural techniques and developments in the UK as a whole, and how, if at all, same might conceivably impact, in- fluence or interact with whatever it is that is obviously forming the crop cir- cle formations, human hoaxing aside. In other words, it takes two to tango. In the case of the circles we have an apparent \"artist,\" along with a pre- ferred medium or canvas, which is the targeted cereal crops themselves. I would simply have liked to have seen the latter issue addressed, out of my own personal curiousity, in somewhat greater depth. Similarly, the UFO \"connection.\" We didn 't mean to imply that nuts 'n' bolts (or other) UFOs might be involved in the actual creation of the circles, but only to suggest, in light of past \"saucer nests\" and similar physical circular traces, that some interesting parallel phenomenology may or may not exist and be subsequently shared by the two phenomena. At the same time, we appreciate the immense labor and commitment that goes into the creation of any book, let alone one with the scope and overall quality of The Crop Circle Enigma. — D. Stacy Dear Editor: In reference to the recent Donald Schmitt and Kevin Randle article (\"What Happened in Ramey's office?\") MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 278 June 1991"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"in the April Journal, I called General DuBose the other day to see how he liked the interview I did with him (January 1991). He stated that he was quite pleased, had read it several times and saw no flaws. \"You've got it right, that's the way it was ... ,\" were his ex- act words. He wanted to know what the reaction was. I told him it had been very positive, except for Schmitt and Ran- dle (S/R). I told him they were claim- ing an earlier interview they did was more accurate. I told the general that I felt the earlier interviews were ram- bling recollections. \"Well that's exactly right. It was when you showed me the pictures that I was able to recall just what had hap- pened,\" DuBose said. He then added, \"You know they tried to hypnotize me but I told them that I can't be hypnotiz- ed. But they tried for two hours with some doctor who kept saying that he could hypnotize anybody. I went along with it, but they never hypnotized me.\" I told the general I had seen an inter- view that S/R claim was done with the general under hypnosis. \"That's bullshit! I can't be hypnotized. I know it for fact. After WW II I was in the Hypnosis Center at Walter Reed Army Hospital and they tried for several days, under various conditions, and it just doesn't work on me.\" This is typical of why there is a dif- ference between the results of S/R's work and that of Bill Moore's and mine. Their interviews are so ambiguous they must interpret what the subject said after the fact. This technique leads to hypothesizing, which in just a few short paragraphs turns into fact. The prime example of this is the mythical flight of July 6, 1947. S/R say that DuBose told them of this flight. But when the facts were gone over, when he review- ed the pictures and refreshed his memory on the dates, he had this to say: \"There was no damn flight on the 6th; 'Butch' Blanchard would never have sent anything on to higher headquarters before his intelligence officer had come back with his report. To even suggest that Blanchard would act on the word of some rancher is a bunch of crap. I knew Blanchard well.\" Schmitt and Randle claim that I didn't bother to interview former Warrant Of- ficer Irving Newton. That's absolutely ridiculous. I even refer to my recent in- terview with Newton in the DuBose in- terview. I also indicate some of what had changed in Newton's story. Even the general rejected it. But they have to build up Newton; he's their star witness. He's the only witness from Fort Worth who hasn't repudiated their conclusions. S/R threw away testimony from Jesse Marcel because they can't make it fit their scenario. There are, on record, four distinct and separate interviews with Marcel. He never wavered from his position that it was the real debris in the pictures. He even signed an af- fidavit testifying to the validity of his statements for the publisher of The Roswell Incident. What confuses S/R is the second half of his statement that the debris had been switched for other pictures. But Marcel never said he saw it switched; he was ordered back to Roswell. It was a logical assumption in light of the cover story that Gen. Ramey was pushing on the press. It just hap- pened to be wrong. S/R's taped interviews of unqualified statements by witnesses are virtually useless. An interview with a witness to an event over 40 years ago is dishonest when the interviewer withholds photo- graphs or other published data from the period that could assist in his recall. Distribution of these tapes doesn't make them any more valid. Editing them makes them even more questionable. Their interview with Dr. J. Bond Johnson is a classic example of attempt- ing to lead a witness. They didn't at- tempt to find out what the witness knew; they tried to tell him what they wanted to hear. I love their suggestion that everyone should look at the pictures and decide for themselves what they show. These are the same pictures that they withheld from Gen. DuBose. I guess the average reader should know more than the military experts who were there. If we carry this concept out we could surely save millions in our judicial system. Think of it: no more need for witness testimony! We could just have juries vote on what they think went on by looking at pictures. Even coroners could pronounce bodies dead by look- ing at pictures. Bill Moore and I are preparing a complete response to Schmitt and Ran- dle to include vital evidence that they, for whatever reason, have chosen to ig- nore. We will also have a section on what the debris in the pictures might actually be. It was courtesy of Kevin Randle that we saw the photo from the Bettman Archives. But how curious that the copy Kevin sent to Bond Johnson should have a transmission tune of 7:59 CST, and the copy that Kevin sent to MUFON has a time of 11:59 CST on it. Now both came from Kevin Randle, but he accused me of getting the time wrong. What gives? I'll close with a quote from General DuBose. \"From now on if anyone asks about what went on, I'm going to tell them that interview is good, it stands (\"New Roswell Revelations — A General Speaks Up,\" January 1991). If they don't like it, that's too bad.\" — Jaime H. Shandera N. Hollywood, CA Dear Editor: I have studied the Corn Circle Phenomenon since 1985, when life in this subject was relatively un- complicated. At that time I realized that the dowsing I had been doing for the previous 15 years on the Ley Lines, or energy grid associated with ancient megalithic sites, was also part of the Corn Circle Phenomenon. To start with, the circles, as they were then, took the form of single circles in varying sizes and in groups of two or three. In 1983, the Quintuplet (that is, the large circle with four satellites) first appeared at Cheesefoot Head, near Winchester. In 1986 the first single- ringed circle appeared and in 1988 a two-ringed circle and also three circles grouped together like a triangle. The last configuration of 1988 was a quin- tuplet with a ring round the satellites, as seen in Circular Evidence. The other significant happening in 1988 was that the quintuplets on some sites doubled in size, and the number of circles had reached approximately 100. This was a MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 278 June 1991"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"quantum leap in the Corn Circle Phenomenon. Nineteen hundred and eighty-nine saw the number of circles double again with all the previous circle configura- tions in evidence, but the final two circles of the season, at Winterbourne Stoke, were of a new type which has not been repeated at the time of going to print. The second configuration was a quartered circle - the photograph by Busty Taylor being the front cover of The Crop Circle Enigma, Ralph Noyes editor. Nineteen hundred and ninety has shown a complete departure from the traditional configurations, producing large pictograms, i.e., circles, triangles, wings, finger and key patterns. The dowsable patterns have also changed very substantially with the widening and amalgamation of lines, which is a new feature evolving in conjunction with the new patterns. Many people are now showing in- terest in the subject, and it is very grati- fying that my original work on dows- ing has now become standard practice for verifying circles. I have proved beyond doubt that all genuine circle configurations have a dowsable print, and that the hoax will not have any rele- vant print. Although there is no need to fear these sudden manifestations, there is need for caution, however, because the energies present can be very powerful indeed and some people will be affected physically by exper- iencing headaches and nausea, while others will experience depression or great elation. When any of these symp- tions occur, the best antidote is to retreat from the circle configuration im- mediately and the symptoms will recede within an hour or so. Others, however, will experience none of these effects. I hope this will begin to show that there is very much more here than we would have appreciated a few years ago, and that quick answers to this wonder- ful happening will not come early. We are only part way through a very com- plex weave of experience and reality which will need some of the best minds brought to bear to begin to show the right pathways to tread.

Total Solar Eclipse: On July 11 the nearest new moon of the year and its alignment with the Sun create North America's longest total eclipse of the Sun (nearly seven minutes) this century and the longest one worldwide until the year 2132. As the Moon crosses the face of the Sun, the tip of our satellite's shadow cone sweeps across Hawaii (the Big Island), southern Baja California, mainland Mexico, Central America, Colombia and Brazil. Persons within this narrow zone (up to 160 miles wide) will experience varying durations of totality, reaching maximum in Baja and western mainland Mexico. At Kailua Kona, Hawaii, partial phases begin at 6:31 AM. The eclipse is total from 7:28 to 7:32. Partial eclipse ends at 8:37. Meanwhile, all of the U.S. except Alaska and the northern half of New England will see a partial eclipse, weather permitting. The closer one is to the path of totality, the more the Sun is obscured. Percentages and local times of max- imum eclipse follow for some sample cities: Atlanta, 28% at 3:32 PM; Chicago, 13% at 2:16; Denver, 37% at 12:51; Honolulu, 96% at 7:30 AM; Houston, 60% at 2:18; Miami, 44% at 3:50; New York, 2% at 3:35; San Diego, 74% at 11:30; Seattle, 20% at 11:23; Tucson, 72% at 12:44; Washington, 7% at 3:34. Warning! While it is perfectly safe to view the totally eclipsed Sun with the naked eye, do not look at any part of the partially covered Sun!

National UFO Information Week The Seventh National UFO Informa- tion Week has been scheduled for August 10-18, 1991. This will be an ideal opportunity for State and State Section groups to set up photo exhibits, displays, booths for receiving UFO sighting reports from the public and closed circuit TV showing of UFO documentaries, etc., in shopping malls and libraries. Advance planning is re- quired in order to reserve space in these facilities and to construct the exhibits and displays. MUFON endorses this program as a Public Education project in order to take advantage of the resurg- ing interest in UFOs by the public, printed media, radio and television. Stan Gordon, State Director for Penn- sylvania, is again planning for a large exhibit at a shopping mall in Greensburg, PA, as he has done in past years.

First, a paper plate UFO model was found in the attic above the garage in the Walters' former home by the present owner. And second, a young man named Tommy Smith telephoned the Gulf Breeze Mayor, Ed Gray, and the Police Chief, Jerry Brown, telling them in a record- ed call that he was a participant in hoax- ing UFO photos with Ed Walters and others. Tommy claimed that Ed had told him how each of the photographs was produced at the time when they were be- ing made. Mark Curtis of WEAR-TV in Pensacola and Craig Meyers, a reporter for the Pensacola Ne^'s-Joumal newspaper, were present during the telephone call to the mayor. This disturbing news prompted the Mutual UFO Network to officially reopen the Ed Walters case in order to investigate the validity of Tommy Smith's claims and to determine if the model was the object photographed by Ed. Rex and Carol Salisberry had been selected by Dan Wright to receive the 1989-90 award for the most outstanding UFO in- vestigation or investigations. Recogniz- ing the honor bestowed upon them and the fact that Rex was not part of the ini- tial investigation team, Charles D. Flan- nigan, the lead investigator and Florida State Director, recommended to Walt Andrus that Rex Salisberry spearhead the reopening of the case. Your Inter- national Director concurred with Mr. Flannigan. At a private meeting on Ju- ly 5, 1990, Mr. Salisberry accepted this responsibility with one stipulation. He would accept the assignment only if Walt Andrus would be willing to accept the disclosure based upon Rex's in- vestigation that the Ed Walters case could be a hoax. Walt Andrus replied in the affirmative, because he had issued a press statement that MUFON had reopened the case based upon the in- credible claims being made. It was the concensus and agreement by these three gentlemen that the reopened investigation was to be con- fidential until a final report was prepared and released. As of this writing, Rex Salisberry has promised to complete his investigation and submit a final report to MUFON. Several months ago he pro- vided a \"question and answer\" format of his findings to both the Pensacola NeH's-Joumal and the Gulf Breeze Sen- tinel for publication without advising Charles Flannigan or Walt Andrus beforehand. This act was in direct con- tradiction to the conditions under which he accepted the assignment. Mr. Salisberry has now written \"A Letter to the Editor\" elaborating upon his personal viewpoints of the case reopening. I must make it clear that Rex still has not submitted his final report to MUFON with the documented evidence substantiating the assertions made in his letter. His letter is being published, as he requested, in this issue of the MUFON UFO Journal for the perusal of our readers. We hope that he will produce and submit a final report in the near future. In the event that Mr. Salisberry fails to submit a final report, a second in- vestigation team under the leadership of Gary Watson, the Chief Investigator for Pensacola MUFON, was authorized and assigned the same task and will submit the results of their reopening of the Ed Walters case. Each of these reports may be very revealing and even contradic- tory. Stay tuned to what has developed into a very controversial subject in Ufology, both pro and con. Like any other UFO sighting, the authenticity of the Ed and Frances Walters' experience must rest upon the documented facts, not hearsay and rumors by \"armchair Ufologists.\" 1990-91 Award The annual MUFON award plaque for the most outstanding contribution to Ufology for 1990-91 will be presented at the MUFON 1991 International UFO Symposium in Chicago, Illinois, on July 6, 1991. The actual contribution or work is not restricted to the calendar year of 1990-91, but may include significant ac- complishments during the past five years. In addition to presenting to pla- que to the recipient, the Fund for UFO Research will provide a $500 cash award in memory of Isabel Davis as in previous years. A special runner-up cash award of $500 will be presented by the Mutual UFO Network in memory of Dr. Dan C. Overlade. Four candidates have been nominated for this prestigious award. In alphabetical order, they are Charles D. Flannigan, Florida State Director; Robert J. Gribble, Western Regional Director; Howard J. Hoffman, Fund for UFO Research and Dan Wright, Deputy Director, Investigations. A ballot was enclosed with the May 1991 issue of the Journal so all members and subscribers may vote for their choice from the candidates nominated. This is your opportunity to not only recognize the fine work of these gentlemen, but to express your personal thanks to the person you feel has contributed significantly to the progress of Ufology. All ballots must be received in Seguin, Texas by June 26, 1991, so adequate time is available to engrave the plaque. 1991 MUFON Symposium \"UFOs: The Big Picture\" is the Continued on page 23 MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 278 June 1991"}]
