Zeiler, MUFON Deputy International Director I n the early evening on Sept. 30, 2001, a large ball-like object that glowed red, yellow, and orange was traveling due south in Lake- wood, Co, following Estes street. This object was unusually low, and ap- peared to be following a green van. As it approached the intersection of Yale Avenue, a bright bluish colored light was seen to extend from the craft toward the moving van. : This light beam .appeared to : scan directly through the automobile, illu- minating the occupant to independent observers. The .beam then retracted toward the object, but stopped just short of it. There it was, partially ex- tended from the pulsating, multi-colored object. It must have been an amazing sight to see. The occu- pant of the van was a man named Stan Romanek, and this is his amazing story!  : . . . Stan .was born in Denver, GO. At approximately the age of 5, Stan's family moved to Northwood,.ND, be- cause his father was in the US Air Force. The UFO ex- periences of Stan and his family really started there. There.is recollection of several UFO sightings around the town of Northwood and over the Grand Forks Air Force Base. Stan doesn't have much recollection of any of theses sightings, due to his young age. The sightings regularly continued after the family moved to Cheyenne and then back to Denver. In December, 2000, Stan was on his way to Red Rocks Amphitheater, to take some pictures for his fiancee when he noticed numerous cars pulling to the side of the road. These people were all staring at an object that was lazily gliding above the power lines that paralleled the road. Stan was shocked to see that the object was directly par- allel to him and only about 100 ft in the air. He grabbed.his camcorder and began trying to take a picture of this object which was making erratic zigzag movements. The object almost instantaneously ascended to several thousand feet. This film was given and shown on FOX News in Denver. No tests or evaluation were ever made of this film, due to the jerky hand motion and blurriness of the object. However, there is no doubt it was an unusual sighting witnessed by a number of different people. More sightings Nine months later, in September 2001, Stan had five individual and distinctly different sightings. The first came while Stan and some friends were returning from a trip to Pennsylvania. Objects were again observed at Daniels Park by Stan and numerous other witnesses. An object then appeared on the 20 th and 23 rd of Sep- tember over his work and over his home. The last sight- ing, on Sept. 30, was on his way home from work. In total, there have now been more than 60 witnesses, plus videotaping.  , , . We will focus most of the story on the 30 th .sighting, as it was the clearest and had the most witnesses. At approximately 7:45 PM on Sept. 30, Stan was on his way home from work when he encountered the object that I described earlier. At first, Stan continued driving southbound on Estes Street until he reached the entrance, to Old Stonehouse Park. There he pulled into the drive- way (see aerial map) and proceeded to get his camcorder out. Round glowing object While.this was happening, the round, glowing object stopped and hovered over a jarge tree in the park. It is estimated that the object was about 250 feet in the air at this time. The height of the tree and the proximity of the craft was confirmed by several other witnesses who were in the park. As Stan stumbled out of his van, half scared and halfangry, he began filming. • , . The object seemed to sense this and began to ascend and move in a southeasterly direction across a small pond and group of picnickers in the park. It is estimated ,that the craft was now about 1000 feet in the air. A group of children saw the object and screamed \"alien,\" \"alien\" to their parents, who were sitting with other family members in a gazebo by the lake. They were hav- ing a birthday party picnic for one of their children. They also had video cameras and shot independent videos of the,object..    . ... .. When all this commotion broke loose, the object as-: cended to approximately 17,500 feet in a couple of sec- onds, which is where the cloud cover was on this evening. It was a night of a full moon, which was just beginning.to rise in the east. There was a little wind (approximately 7 mph) coming from the SE to NW. While hovering at the edge of clouds, the object continued its pulsation, and then abruptly bolted to the west. It appeared to the naked eye to have blinked out. A few seconds later it came back into view at the edge of the clouds. It seemed to remain there for awhile and then disappeared into the clouds. Simultaneously there was a large flash of what appeared to be lightning. A few October 2002 MUFON UFO Journal Page 3"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"TTzree o/f/ze drawings provided'by separate witnesses. seconds later the object reappeared, but looked as if it was moving farther to the SE. Again, it went into the clouds, and there was the simul- taneous lightning. What makes that so mysterious is that there was never any sound. No witness has ever spoken of hearing sounds associated with this object. The investigation MUFON received the first report of this sighting from Peter Davenport of the National UFO Reporting Center. We invited Mr. Romanek to our office, where he showed us his video and told us his story. I began calling selected information centers, the US weather service, Denver International Control Tower, the FAA, and other airports around the metro area. I also contacted all the police agencies serving this and surround- ing areas to determine if there were any radar contacts or other reports of the sighting. Mr. Romanek provided us with the names of many people who were in the park that day. I began systemati- cally contacting these witnesses to get their information. Much of what we had learned earlier was validated by these statements and interviews. The protocol we used for interviewing the witnesses involved their giving an uninterrupted version in narrative form. Then we asked a series of questions to fill in the blanks. For the most part the witnesses were audio re- corded. Transcripts will be included in the master file at MUFON HQ. Permission was received from parents before interviewing any juvenile witnesses. Some wit- nesses drew examples of what they saw that evening. For convenience of space and time, I will give you a few quotes from some of the witnesses: Witness #1 \"When I first saw it I was amazed and in awe! It was rapidly pulsating and the colors flowed as when you blow a bubble in the sunlight.\" Witness #2 \"It was as large as a two-car garage. It was huge. And there was no sound. Just blinking light. The bottom had a star shape. The lights seemed to run along the edges of the star.\" Witness #3 A grandfather attending the picnic said, \"The craft, when it flew over me, was amazing. It ap- peared to have flowing liquid swirling around the bottom. This liquid continuously changed color. There was no sound, It had to be intelligently controlled, because it stopped and hovered, changed direction, and flew into the wind.\" Witness #4 \"There were rails along the edges of the star and up the sides of the craft. It appeared like a hon- eycomb. Beautiful changing colors. The object zigzagged away very fast. Very fast.\" The common response from virtually every witness was that they had never seen anything like this before. They all confirmed that this was not an airplane, helicop- ter, balloon, or any kind of remote-controlled device or model. They almost described it as a huge pulsating light. This not all of the story. Mr. Romanek came back for an additional interview. He indicated he was having bad dreams about possum-faced creatures. One morning he had awakened with oozing sores around his wrists, and had fresh surgical scars in his lower spinal area (see Jour- nal cover). He claims he never had surgery in that area. Upon consulting with Ethan Rich, former Colorado State Director and someone I knew had been working in this area of study, we put Mr. Romanek under lower power black light with little or no results showing. However, us- ing 15-watt black light, we observed an amazing sight. His wrists glowed with a yellow-green fluorescence, and each wrist, both front and back, had a quarter sized or- ange fluorescent mark (see Journal cover and page 5). We filmed these with a 35mm camera. Then we at- tempted to scrub the marks off with no visible effect. Over time the fluorescing diminished and went away. We later took Mr. Romanek to one of our consultants in hypnotherapy and had a regression session done. The regression will be the subject of a future article by the consultant, Mrs. Deborah Lindemann. Video Analysis The video analysis was done by Jeffrey Sainio, MUFON consulting analyst. Here are some of the high- lights of his analysis: \"The UFO speed decreases about 41% in a 3-second period. Speed is steady before and after deceleration. The most striking characteristic is a blinking, measured at 8.26 (within 0.02%) blinks per second. Humans have ah upper limit of about 10 blinks per second for recognition.'This behavior excludes normal aircraft lighting, strobe lights, or incandescent light filaments.\" There are a number of other technical points of inter- est, but we will not discuss them here as the investigation Page 4 MUFON UFO Journal October 2002"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Under a 15-watt black light, the wrists of Mr. Romanek glowed a yellow-green, and marks on his wrists (front and back) glowed with an orange fluorescence.  ... is ongoing, and other analysts are currently working on the video. The other independent videos validate the find- ings of this video. It is very important for our readers to understand the significance of this case. There is much relevent evidence, and other scientific models are being used to further test the credibility and expand the evidence. This is a dra- matic encounter that brings solid video, physiological, and trace evidence into play. We shall keep the Journal read- ers informed. . Dillman's Washington, D.C., sighting summarized By Joan Woodward Time: July 26,2002, between.1:00 AM and 1:55 AM Location: Brandywine, MD Background Information GPS reading for Brandywine site: 38 degrees 41' 57\", 076 degrees 48' 33\". Compass readings seemed off, so directions were taken by the setting sun and power lines as landmarks, and verified by topographic maps. Direc- tions derived by the sun/topographic maps are in good agreement with Dillman's estimates. The site is a sand-and-gravel operation, and affords an excellent view of the sky, with exceptions being an area to the north obscured by a nearby small grove of trees, and an area on the southern horizon between SSE and SE where trees along a nearby road obscure a segment of the the horizon. Of importance in this report is that Waldorf is to the SW, and fighters from Andrews Air Force Base maneu- vered in the SE sky, and both of these areas were clear of obstruction. The witness, Gary Dillman, is in his early 60's, a re- tired-policeman with the Washington, D.C., Police De- partment. He has 15 years experience as a private inves- tigator, has worked security for five years at the large sand-and-gravel operation where the sighting took place, and is very familiar with air base activity in the area. He is a 30-year resident of southern Maryland, and quite familiar with the geographical area. He is a MUFON Field Investigator, arid a MUFON State Section Director for Maryland. Although he has a long-time interest in the UFO field, this is his first sighting. This site is about 8 miles NE of the Waldorf area where Renny Rogers had a sighting during the same time period, and is about 6 miles SE of Andrews. Weather conditions were similar to those described for the Rogers sighting, although Dillman said he saw the moon periodically arid briefly through the upper overcast. Sequence of Events 1. At 1 AM, four fighters take off from Andrews and maneuver in the .distant SE sky, sometimes returning to Andrews area and then flying back to the SE. 2. An orange object appears in SW sky and banks October 2002 MUFON UFO Journal PageS"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"away when a fighter approaches. 3. This scenario is repeated 10 minutes later. 4. At 1:55 am, four fighters return to Andrews. Dillman was sitting in his truck looking east when he heard aircraft take off from Andrews. Two fighters came from the NW (Andrews is about 6 miles to the NW) and flew over the wit- ness, heading SE. Then two more fighters flew over from the NW, going SE, but their flight path was slightly more to the S than the first pair. All four aircraft were in view at the same time. Some fighters were using short bursts of their afterburners, which Dillman could see and hear the boom. Dillman noticed a white blinking strobe light with a pattern of 1-2-3-4-pause on these aircraft, and this is how he tracked them for the next half- hour. For the most part, he could see only one fighter at a time in the distance, sometimes two, as they did air-show type maneuvers in the E-SE sky. This included tight circles and banking turns right and left. One did a hard left turn immedi- ately followed by a hard right turn, then a tight circle. The fighters would return, usually in pairs, to the Andrews AFB area only to fly back to the SE again, or sometimes fly south of Dillman's position, and then bear to the SE. They were not flying in formation. The activity to the SE was generally about 20-25 degrees above the horizon, probably over southern Maryland, a fairly popu- lated area. .Dillman called WTOP news radio at 1:30 AM to alert them .that something unusual was happening. Soon after his call to WTOP, Dillman saw a round orange ball on a downward path coming toward him in the SW sky. First seen at about 25-30 degrees over the SW horizon, it grew brighter and larger as it descended to about 20 degrees. At that point, a fighter appeared out of the clouds, com- ing from the N or E, turning toward the orange object, which responded with a smooth curving banking turn to the S arid away from the fighter, which followed. During the turn, the orange circle appeared oval. The distance between the orange oval/circle and the fighter was esti- mated at 3.5 cm at arm's length. They flew S, curving E, still about 20 degrees above the horizon until lost in the cloud layer toward the SE. The orange ball and the fighter maintained a constant dis- tance from one another; in other words, the orange ball did not outrun the fighter, and the fighter stayed right with the orange ball. Dillman emphasized that the orange circle and the fighter were not close to him. His guess was that they may have been in the Waldorf area (7 miles away). Total time of this sequence is estimated to be 10-15 seconds. The only noise detected was the sound from the fighter. At 1:40 AM, Dillman called WTOP a second time with an update regarding the orange circle and the fighter. He could still see a couple of aircraft moving in the eastern sky; Just after his call, a similar sequence of events to the above occurred. Again in the SW sky at about 25 degrees from the The parking lot at MUFON Headquarters was busy as several UFO groups set up on Aug. 24 to celebrate UFO Awareness Week. Speakers included Paola Harris, Ryan Wood, George Zeiler, and Deborah Lindemann.

It appeared as a slender oval, and as it banked it became more and more round as it headed to the S. It was being followed by one fighter. The distance between them was about the same as before. They flew S or SE, still turning, and then curved to the E again and disappeared in the same area of the sky as before into the clouds. The entire flight path was level. This sequence also lasted 10-15 seconds. After this, Dillman neither saw nor heard aircraft until 1:55 AM, when a pair of fighters coming from the SE, followed by a second pair, flew toward Andrews as if approaching for landing. No more was seen or heard. Description of the orange circle The color was the same as that of an edible orange, and no variation could be seen. It had a hard edge (i.e., it was more comparable to looking at a softly glowing piece of metal than it was to looking at a light source). The orange circle was much larger than the white strobing light of the fighter. Dillman's sense was that the orange circle was as big as the fighter. Comparing the size of the orange circle to aircraft and other lights available at the site, arm's length estimates using a clear centimeter ruler ranged from !/2 mm to 2 mm, with Dillman feeling strongly the 2 mm estimate was the more accurate one. Its shape was round except for the times when it was banking and appeared oval, and once as a thin oval or ellipse. Dillman had a gut feeling he might be looking at some sort of exhaust, but realized that did not make sense as he was seeing an orange circle as it approached him head on. This is the basic information. A neighbor of Rogers in the Waldorf area sighting has just been interviewed, and his observations will be presented shortly. Connections, similarities, and differences between the three observers can then be outlined and presented.

UFO reportedly captured on video tape in Turkey By Esen Sekerkarar On May 26, 2002, an unusually shaped object was re- corded on an amateur camera in the Anadolu Hisari dis- trict of Istanbul, Turkey. Saffet Sap, a 42-year-old electri- cal engineer, and his sister Serpil Sap were filming the lightning on this rainy day. \"At around 18:30 PM I was filming the lightning from the window at the northern side of my house,\" says Saffet Sap. \"Then I saw a strange object in the sky, at a distance of about 2 km. At first I thought it was either a kite or a plane; however, the stationary object started to rise after awhile. It had 7 or 8 legs. There were green, yellow and red lights flashing on the top of it. Green smoke was also emitted at the underside of the object.\" After hovering for a while, the object started to move towards the north and went out of sight behind a hill, leav- ing a greenish trail behind. The witnesses managed to film it for about 3.5 minutes. The media was very interested in the footage, and images of the UFO were broadcast on several national TV channels. This news was also pub- lished in many of the national papers. The close-ups of the image show the unusual shape of the UFO clearly, just as Mr. Sap said: \"It resembled a bug, it had about 7 to 8 legs.\" He also stated that the shape of the object could be seen clearly with the naked eye, and it was an object in the atmosphere, about 2000 meters above the ground. In close-ups, the object can be seen rotating around its own axis and remaining station- ary from time to time. According to the witnesses, it did not make any sound and did not show any characteristics of a conventional craft. . . . . .

Lang MS, CHt M any close encounter experiencers describe how they have acquired increased psychic abilities and become more \"metaphysically aware\" as a result of their encounters. Researcher case files, as well as much of the literature, describe the phe- nomenon of psychic/spiritual awakening as being ex- tremely common among UFO abductees. Yet, the UFO phenomenon appears to be just one possible initiator of such a transition. Introduction A few years ago, I had the privilege of working with a close encounter experiencer whom I will refer to as \"Evelyn.\" This woman had been struggling for several years with the emotional effects of a series of close en- counter experiences. They had struck terror in her heart, and she had developed major phobias as a result of them. In addition, she had begun to experience intrusive para- normal effects in her life and that of her family. Watches and clocks would not work. Electronics around her would cease to function. Several months later another experiencer whom I will refer;to.as \"Amy\" also approached me to do hypnotherapy work with her. She was also dealing with an issue related to close encounters, but apparently quite dissimilar to Evelyn's. While Evelyn was struggling with the fear en- gendered by the intrusion of the phenomenon into her pri- vate lifei Amy was attempting to come to terms with an unwanted gift. This took the form of a sudden, involun- tary, unexpected psychic awakening, apparently as a re- sult of her encounters. While these two experiencers seemed to have very different relationships with the phenomenon, they had one thing in common. Both were attempting to come to terms with an apparent side effect of the close encounter phe- nomenon which I refer to as Unexpected Awakening. I have noted that nearly all experiencers describe this ef- fect. I have also noted that, like other aspects of close en- counters, its relationship with the UFO phenomenon is full of mystery. In this article, I'll examine some aspects of psychic awakening and see how it is-and is not-related to the UFO and close encounter phenomenon. What can we learn from this effect? Is psychic awakening a result of the close encounter phenomenon? Might these two phe- nomena occur together in some sort of lockstep relation- ship? Or is the psychic awakening aspect of the UFO phenomenon simply part of the greater psychic/spiritual emergence phenomenon described in the literature? 1 What is an Awakening? This effect, which I will refer to in this article as the Awakening phenomenon, is described by nearly all PageS About the author Craig R. Lang is a field investigator with Mutual UFO Network, and is a certified clinical hypnotherapist with the National Guild of Hypnotists. He lives in Brooklyn Center, MN, and conducts UFO and close encounter re- search in the Twin Cities metro area of Minneapolis and Saint Paul and in surrounding areas within Minnesota and Wisconsin.

Cases of this sudden personal transformation fill my files as well as those of many other researchers. So just what seems to be happening to those experiencers who describe this phenomenon? What is a psychic/spiri- tual Awakening? The answer to this question may be quite different for different people. However, broadly speaking, the effects seem to fall into two categories. The first is the unex- pected onset/enhancement of psychic abilities. Precog- nition, spontaneous telepathy, clairvoyance, and many other psychic experiences seem to be commonplace. In addi- tion, many experiencers simply report a greater sense of mental awareness. As one experiencer told me \"I feel psychic.\" Another aspect of the Awakening phenomenon is a sudden change in spiritual and social outlook. Many experiencers I have interviewed describe how their view- points-especially on environmental topics-suddenly switched from being largely unconcerned to being very much concerned. At the same time, the religious-spiritual views of many experiencers seem to become much deeper. Frequently they adopt an entirely new viewpoint-often eastern or mystical in nature. This new spiritual dimension in their lives seems to take on a very personal tone. Many of them now practice meditation or have a regular spiritual practice which is deeply heart-felt. Many report being more empathetic and often describe, in the words of one abductee, \"becoming closer to God.\" I often observe experiencers associate the religious/ spiritual change in their lives with the sudden emergence of their psychic abilities, and also, frequently with the emerging memories of their encounters. The result can be a massive transformation of their professional, social, spiritual, mental, and psychological foundation-'the Awak- ening.\" Fear and paranormal fallout When I first began working with Evelyn, 2 1 was struck by the depth of the impact which the close encounter phenomenon had had on her life. She had experienced several terrifying close encounters in which classic gray MUFON UFO Journal October 2002"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"entities had floated her from her bed and taken her into their domain (presumably a UFO). As a result of these events, she had developed phobias which included ner- vousness at being alone in her house at night. She had also developed simultaneous fear of, and obsession with, the night sky-as well as with any UFO literature. Also, at about the time of her encounters, her outlook abruptly changed from that of the \"average\" person who was largely unconcerned with the outside world to that of being more environmentally aware, socially concerned, and spiritually oriented. During this same time, she and her family also experi- enced a number of paranormal and metaphysical anoma- lies. Balls of light, UFO ground traces, creature sightings, electrical sensitivity, clocks that would randomly gain or lose time, numerous UFO sightings, and the list went on... As we commenced our hypnotherapy work and began to resolve the fear factor, we found that the phenomenon had apparently awakened within her a deep mystical awareness. The potential for this awareness seemed to have al- ways been there, but had been suppressed for much of her life. As we explored her interactions with the phe- nomenon, it became apparent that it had been lifelong (she indicated that it had actually been over many life- times). Yet only now had she become consciously aware of her encounters. Today, Evelyn has finished her teaching degree and is avidly pursuing interests in metaphysical and historical studies. She is now free of the fear factor and comfort- able with the memories of her encounters. She views her relationship with the phenomenon as life altering and, on the balance, very positive. For Evelyn, it appears that the fear-engendering ab- duction events might have been the \"kick\" that drove her to come to terms with what had in-fact been a long-stand- ing relationship-her Awakening. Amy-unexpected psychic gifts Amy had felt overwhelmed at the time we first began our work. A few years earlier, she had experienced a powerful, dream-like experience which seemed very much to be a close encounter (though with few of the classic elements). In the days subsequent to this experience, she discovered that she had become very psychic. There was no escape from this new sense. It seemed to perpetually bombard her awareness. It was as if she had been blind from birth, only to suddenly gain her vision late in life. Her life experience up to that point had not prepared her for this gift. In addition to the sudden awakening of psychic abili- ties, she was also experiencing episodes of spontaneous invisibility-times in which she apparently became invis- ible to those around her. 3 Her new-found psychic and paranormal talents were unpredictable and uncontrollable, a frightening influence in her life. Initially, as we began therapy, the goal was to some- how control these manifestations. We quickly realized that the more we tried to \"master\" them, the more resis- tance we got. Clearly, control and containment was not the answer. So we decided \"Why not just go with it ? '- accept and embrace them? I suggested to her a couple of books on psychic devel- opment, most prominently the book You are Psychic by Peter Sanders. This book contains a number of excellent techniques to help its readers develop their psychic skills. In a followup conversation a few months later, she in- formed me that she had begun organizing a psychic de- velopment group, based upon Sanders' book. By em- bracing her psychic gifts, she appears to have been able to integrate them into her life in a meaningful way. Were Amy's new-found psychic abilities the result of a classic UFO abduction? Amy had few other indica- tions to suggest that she was a classic UFO abductee. Additionally, Amy had been involved in meditation and other spiritual studies for years, which suggests that per- haps she had simply reached a new stage in her path-one which she perhaps did not expect. : • .. Yet her Awakening did begin with her UFO-like dream experience. Perhaps the UFO dream was part of the overall experience, or perhaps it, too, was an effect of her awakening.    •'•••' Perceivers and experiencers As I continued to conduct research into the close en- counter phenomenon, it became clear that this Awaken- ing effect often occurred at critical times in the experiencer's life. In addition, it nearly always coincided with their emerging memories of UFO experiences. What did this timing mean? This still is not clear to me. How- ever, as I continued to interview other people who had experienced this sudden emergence, I discovered a sur- prise.    : Before I had begun my study and practice of hypno- therapy, I had interviewed many experiencers of para- normal events. Most of them described paranormal anomalies, psychic experiences, and other strange events in their lives. Many had had multiple UFO sightings. As a result of their accounts, and based upon the writ- ings of other UFO researchers, 4 1 had hypothesized that these witnesses were probably UFO abductees. How- ever as we later explored the experiences of some of them (often in deep hypnotic trance), I noted that some- times we were completely unable to find instances of UFO abductions. 5 While they had indeed experienced the Awakening effects, the initiator did not seem to be UFOlogical. There is much literature to indicate that unexpected psychic/spiritual emergence is a very common result of profound life-altering events. 6 ' 7 Events such as illness or trauma, near-death experiences, deep meditative trance- all seem to be possible initiators of an Awakening. While the descriptions of each of these experiences can be very different, the effects are often similar. Many of these people subsequently seem to develop the ability to see UFO's and anomalies in situations where others around them often do not. Thus, I will refer to the UFO- seeing persons as \"perceivers.\" \"Rosalie,\" a lifetime of wonders An example of a perceiver, who has had many UFO October 2002 MUFON UFO Journal Page 9"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"and anomaly sightings, apparently as part of a lifetime of paranormal sensitivity, is a woman I will refer to as \"Rosalie.\" Rosalie is a pleasant, caring, and very intelli- gent senior citizen who lives in a senior apartment build- ing in rural Minnesota. I had the privilege of interviewing her and her family and learned that Rosalie had many strange memories that stretched back as far as the 1920's. These included para- normal events, anomalies, and UFO sightings^ We first suspected that she might be an abductee. However as we conducted several hypnotic regressions, we found none of the classic abduction accounts. Yet, while under hypnosis, she described in great detail many encounters with the extraordinary. .She described how, as a child, she played with elves in the .woods near her house. She described seeing helicop- ters during the early 1940s, although machines matching her description did not exist until many years later. She described balls of light and a host of mysterious psychic perceptions. Yet we found'no UFO abductions, per se. Thus Rosalie is someone whom I would regard as a per- ceiver. While she has had a few UFO sightings, they appeared to be in some way secondary to her overall Awakening. ,.-..- \"Anne\"-a spectacular sighting Another perceiver I was privileged to interview exten- sively was a woman whom I will refer to as \"Anne.\" Anne is a woman in her early 40's who lives in Minne- apolis. She has a long history of interest in eastern spiri- tuality and metaphysics,,meditates regularly, and has had numerous mystical experiences. Over many years, Anne has steadily developed a high degree of psychic ability. And, like Rosalie, few of her experiences have directly involved the UFO phenomenon. While she has become steadily more \"awakened,\" this has been a gradual growth process. ... While Anne has had few actual UFO events in her life, she was witness to one very spectacular sighting which occurred during a power outage one summer night in 1995 in Minneapolis. When the lights went out, Anne stepped to the window to.look out onto the street below. Many people had stepped out onto the sidewalk and street, and were standing about, charting, andjoking-waiting for the power to come back on. When Anne looked out the window, to her surprise she observed an extremely large UFO hovering only a few hundred feet above the building tops, only a few blocks away from her building. The object was positioned in such a way that everyone should have seen it. Yet Anne seemed to be the only one aware of it. Many such cases exist in my files, and those of other researchers, in which a few apparently-sensitive witnesses are able to discern the presence of a UFO while others might not see it. In many of these cases, the witness had previously experienced the awakening phenomenon to a high degree. However, only a few of these perceivers \"actually seem to be abductees. Rather, they seem to ex- perience the UFO phenomenon primarily because their heightened sensitivity somehow allows them to perceive it. Contactees: already awakened experiences? In yet another group we find the contactees. 8 Far more involved in the phenomenon than perceivers, contactees generally describe close encounters in which they are very much voluntary participants. In most cases, these events seem to be positive in nature, involving extraordinary but generally benevolent entities. The contact experience tends to further enhance the psychic/spiritual path of the experiencer and .of others. Also, along with the overt contact experiences, contactees frequently describe communication that is apparently chan- neled in nature—suggesting greatly increased psychic/para- normal perception. 9 Since their experiences are largely positive in nature, few contactees have sought hypnotherapy. Thus, I have generally not been a party to exploration of their experi- ences at the deep subconscious level. Yet as a MUFON researcher and field investigator, I have interviewed many contactees who live in the Minneapolis/St. Paul area. Most have indicated that contact was simply part of a long path of metaphysical growth and exploration. They tell me, nearly unanimously, that their path has led them to be more sensitive to the extraordinary, and thus eventu- ally to contact. Thus, in this case their UFO-related events seem to be effects, rather than causes, of their Awaken- ing.     , End Notes and References: 'Bryant and Seebach, \"Healing Shattered Reality, Understanding the Contact Phenomenon\"  ' 2 See Craig R.

I can not deny that this could be the case. However, we explored as deeply as was ethically acceptable to do, with no indication of CE4 activity.. To explore deeper might have generated the implicit hyp- notic suggestion that the experiencer should \"go find an abduction event.\" In the interests of good therapy and solid research, we stopped well before this point.

A Chilean cameramen from Mega, a private TV Chan- nel, was filming the World Trade Center area a few weeks after the tragedy. The cameraman reportedly captured two UFOs flying over lower Manhattan near Ground Zero. The UFOs appear in the sky with orange and yellow col- ors, and an aircraft can also be seen passing the UFOs. All three flying objects are in the same general area, and the cameraman captured a close-up of the aircraft next to the UFO. Shortly, another aircraft flew over the same area and next to the second UFO, giving a good perspective and comparison. The Cameraman gave the AION group the video for study.

I pointed out what distortion results from not doing this and what happens to any \"scientific\" exploration when people know something is missing but don't know what and fill in the blanks without evidence.

Response to Friedman column ByKarlPflock Hi, Dwight,, Below, a response to Stan Friedman's column in the August MUFON UFO Journal. I have known Stan Friedman for more than 10 years, considering him not only a colleague, but friend. So it is that I am doubly disappointed by his attack on me and my Roswell work in his August \"Perceptions\" column. (Though I do appreciate his prominent mentions of my Roswell: Inconvenient Facts and the Will to Believe and Jim Moseley's and my Shockingly Close to the Truth/-Confessions of a Grave-Robbing Ufologist. Every little bit helps, even \"anti-endorsements.\") In his column, Friedman not so subtly implied that I do my research \"by proclamation\" and that I am a debunker. Yet he knows neither is true. He knows I spent years digging into the Roswell mo- rass, in the field and in the archives, interviewing dozens of witnesses and \"witnesses,\" studying real and bogus documents, and on and oh, seeking to glean the facts from the muck of misrepresentation, error, self-promotion, and wishful thinking. At many points along the way, he and I compared notes, shared information, and worked together to get at the truth on a number of key issues and person- alities. Beyond Roswell, Friedman knows I am convinced by the data that we have been visited by nonhuman intelli- gence,' that UFOs are real and some of them were flying saucers, craft from an extra-solar planet of our galaxy. He knows that when it comes to UFOs themselves we agree on far more than we disagree. Why, then, is Friedman so determined to raise doubts about me and my work? I regretfully conclude it can be summed up in four words: bottom line and ego. Roswell, the \"Cosmic Watergate,\" is Friedman's ufological bread and butter, and he is not about to let it slip from his grasp if he can help it. Unfortunately, from his point of view, I have the audacity not only to disagree with him on Roswell-the case on which, regrettably, he has hung his ufological career and reputation for more than two de- cades-but I do so oh the basis of a vast body of hard evidence resulting from years of solid research. The Roswell story is tangled and complex, impossible to address adequately here. The task of untangling it is equally complex. Presenting the evidence and the basis for my conclusions drawn from it requires a book, which I have written and encourage the open-minded to read. Those who do so will find the matter is not nearly so simple as Friedman suggests when he disingenuously asserts I concluded \"there was no Roswell crashed sau- cer event, because it wasn't noted in any number of USAF UFO documents.\" In making this rather snide statement, Friedman con- veniently ignores the incovenient fact that the documents in question-not just USAF, but also CIA, U.S. Army, and joint USAF-U.S. Navy-are essentially the icing on the cake at the Roswell wake, that I painstakingly examined the whole Roswell story and, to my great disappointment, Page 14 MUFON UFO Journal October 2002"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"found it and the tale tellers on whom Friedman and others rely to be at best honestly mistaken and at worst liars and publicity hounds. But let us briefly consider the documents Friedman so airily dismisses. (Those interested in a detailed consider- ation will find it in chapter 15. of my book.) This formerly classified and undeniably genuine record entailed no fewer than 41 documents at the time I closed my book manu- script. All date,from shortly after the Roswell excite- ment in early July 1947 through mid-1955. Of these, 7 had been classified Top Secret; 31 Secret; and 3 Confi- dential or Restricted. Seventeen of these were declassified before publica- tion of the first Roswell book (The Roswell Incident, 1980). A .total of 28 had been declassified before re- lease of Randle and Schmitt's Roswell-revival tome UFO Crash at Roswell (1991), Friedman's (with Don Ber- liner) Crash at Corona (1992), and my Fund for UFO Research monograph Roswell in Perspective ( 1994). The truth was out there, but somehow Friedman and the rest of us missed it-or chose to ignore it, as Friedman and others still do. ,,,,'.,. Here are a few essential and inconvenient facts con- veniently dismissed by Friedman and other Roswell sau- cer-crash advocates: — The documents were communications among and between top-level military and scientific men who abso- lutely would have known about the recovery of a crashed saucer. They were the very people whose job it was to crack the flying saucer mystery. Most of them would have been involved in setting up, directing, and working on the project that would have studied any \"crash recov- ered exhibits.\" The others would have levied information requirements on the project and studied and attempted to exploit its results. — The documents not only make clear these men had no knowledge of a crashed saucer, they also contain ex- plicit statements about the absence of physical evidence and the considerable frustration this caused. — If there had been a saucer recovered near Roswell and the authors of the documents knew of this-as they certainly would have-they would not have lied to their colleagues arid superiors about it. If the crashed saucer or related issues needed to be discussed, the documents in which this was done would have been classified ac- cordingly. If not, these matters would not have been mentioned, although, as appropriate, addressees would have been referred to more highly classified documents by referr ence. It is absurd in the extreme to believe senior offi- cials charged with such major responsibilities and close cooperation would lie to each other. Speaking of classification, what about Friedman's oft- repeated assertion, repeated yet again in his column, that anything and everything about a crashed saucer would necessarily have been classified Top Secret, with access further restricted through sorcalled codeword compartmentation? In effect what Friedman is saying is, \"I believe crashed saucer info is super-sensitive. There- fore, those responsible in 1947 would have thought so, top, and therefore, this info \"must\" have been classified and compartmented higher than and/or more closely con- trolled than now declassified UFO documents.\" This is utter nonsense. Just because a ufologist thinks the recovery of a crashed saucer would be treated as super-duper-sensitive, it does not mean the responsible U.S. government officials would concur. I have no doubt the secrets of alien technology derived from study and exploitation of crashed-saucer wreckage would be con- sidered vital national security information and classified, much of it at the highest level, and tightly compartmented as well. However, it does not make sense that the fact that a saucer had been captured would remain classified for more than a short while. Consider just one of several reasons: If one saucer crashed, others might, and prob- ably not where the U.S. government could control the situation-say Central Park or, worse yet, Moscow's Red Square. Where would that leave the boys at MJ-12? Would they try to keep a lid on the news? (How?!) And when, inevitably, that failed, what would they tella fright- ened and angry American public, \"No sweat, we already have one\"?      : Finally, it appears Friedman thinks the codeword \"UM- BRA\" has something to do with flying saucers. In dis- missing the documents discussed above, he wrote, \"[N]one of these were classified TOP SECRET Codeword: They couldn't have contained TOP SECRET UMBRA infor- mation.\" Apparently, he made the UMBRA-saiicer con- nection because certain National Security Agency \"UFO docurnents\" carried the UMBRA codeword. Sorry, Stan, no cigar or saucer. UMBRA refers to, and is used only to protect, sources and rhethods employed to obtain the information in docu- ments so labeled. It has nothing whatever to do with the substantive information obtained via those sources and methods-as Friedman would know if he did a little more investigation and a lot less proclaiming. Stan Friedman has made many important contributions to ufology, most notably in very effectively demonstrating and tirelessly spreading the word that the extraterrestrial hypothesis for the origin of UFOs is completely consis- tent with current earthly scientific knowledge and theory. Unfortunately, he also has been a major factor in the cre- ation of what I now think of as ufology's self-manufac- tured all-in-rone red herring and black hole. Roswell has diverted too many of our best and bright- est-not the least being Stanton T. Friedman-away from study of the vast body of UFO data in which the unim- peachable answer to the UFO mystery likely lies buried. It has sucked in and devoured a huge portion of ufology's minuscule resources, which could have been far better spent on such work. If there is an MJ-12 cabal intent upon keeping the secret of the saucers from us, they must be delighted. P.S. I was not, as Friedman wrote, an \"Assistant Deputy Director of Defense,\" whatever that may be. I was a deputy assistant secretary of defense-to be tech- nically precise, a deputy director with the rank of deputy assistant secretary.

Galganski, Fund for UFO Research, Washington, D.C., 2002, 8!/2 X 11 soft cover, 79 pages. Reviewed by Dwight Connelly As Rob Swiatek of the Fund for UFO Research asks in the Foreword of this publication, \"What's left to write about this most infamous of UFO cases, a case where battle lines pro and con fossilized years ago?\" His answer: \"A fresh look at the data: an engineering viewpoint.that seeks to reconcile anecdotal accounts of the. debris : field outside .of Roswell, NM, with the physical characteristics of materials, such as foil and neoprene, now thought by many to have been the true constituents of the putative UFO wreckage.\" Robert Galganski, who has spent the past eight years studying this case, holds the M.S. in civil engineering from the State University of New York at Buffalo, and has more than 25 years experience in vehicle crash-safety research, including mathematical modeling and data analy- sis. Utilizing a wide range of data-and specifically acknowl- edging the assistance of Robert J. Durant and David Rudiak in answering questions and allowing him to uti- lized their research, Galganski has zeroed in on one spe- cific question: does the amount of debris reported at the J.B. Foster ranch 74 miles northwest of Roswell match the quantity of materials which made up Project Mogul Flight 4 (the explanation most often provided by anti- Roswell researchers for the debris). The author looks at two descriptions by two witnesses in order to arrive at a starting point regarding the size of the debris field. Maj. Jesse Marcel's recollection of the debris field was that of a \"very narrow elongated region heavily populated with mostly thin-shell material'.' scat- tered over an area several hundred feet wide by VA of a mile long, according to Galganski: Utilizing numerous calculations and illustrations, the author concludes that a \"very conservative quantity esti- mate\" of the material in the debris field \"indicated that 40 Flight 4 balloon trains would have been needed to provide enough material to outline and lightly litter the area de- scribed by Marcel.\"  ; Another witness to the debris field, rancher Mack Brazel, described a smaller circular field about 600 feet in diameter, a description favored by anti-Roswell research- ers. But Galganski says, \"Everything that Roswell de- tractors accept as Gospel about the field-its shape and size, the source and type of debris that covered it, and the L •THE ROSWELL DEBRIS FIELD: •. AN ENGINEER'S PERSPECTIVE testimony of persons they rely on-was employed to con- struct a correctly scaled drawing of the site containing an identically scaled hypothetical arrangement of the same liberal amount of Mogul debris.\" Again utilizing numer- ous calculations and illustrations, Galganski concludes that \"it would be impossible to arrange the debris in any man- ner within the perimeter of Brazel's field to warrant re- garding it as a litter-filled region.\" The author also deals with the \"new hypothesis from the anti-Roswell camp\" that suggests there were multiple fields, and that Major Marcel misrernembered them as one 3 /4-mile long strip of debris. Concludes the author: \"Flight 4 couldn't create even one thinly populated debris field.\" This study, of course, will no doubt be questioned by those who are con- vinced that Project Mogul Flight 4 did create the famous debris field, and the Roswell debate will continue. But Bob Galganski has provided an important look at evidence which must be consid- ered by anyone trying to untangle the mystery of Roswell. The Hunt for Zero Point; One Man s Journey to Discover the Biggest Secret Since the Invention of the Atom Bomb, by Nick Cook, 2001, Century, London, 281 pages, $26.00. Reviewed by Dr. Barry H. Downing When Moses and Aaron confronted Pharaoh in bibli- cal Egypt, Aaron threw down his magic (God empow- ered) rod, and it became a snake, \"Then Pharaoh sum- moned the wise men and the sorcerers; and they also, the magicians of Egypt, did the same by their secret arts. Each one threw down his staff, and they became snakes; but Aaron's staff swallowed up theirs.\" (Exodus 7:11,12) As we have dealt with the UFO mystery, we have had to deal with two major issues: establishing that UFOs ex- ist, and are some kind of advanced technology, and then determining if that technology is of human or extraterres- trial origin. Our general conclusion has been that the operational characteristics of UFOs are so advanced that they could not be of human origin. But there is a sense in which Nick Cook is like Pharaoh's magicians, not throwing down snakes, but throwing us a story that says UFOs may be advanced human technology. How can we be sure that some UFOs are extraterres- trial, with so many snakes crawling (or flying) around? The dust jacket to Cook's book says, \"The Hunt for Zero Point is the true story of ,a journey to reveal an awesome new energy.\" This is not quite true. Cook began looking for the pos- sibility that, somewhere in America's black budget de- fense network, scientists were working on anti-gravity projects. This was a taboo subject-too hot to discuss with Page 16 MUFON UFO Journal October 2002"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"most of the above top secret world which Cook inhabited as aviation editor of Jane s Defence Weekly. If your con- tacts are not going to dry up, in this borderland between the public and the super secret world, you have to be careful about what kind of questions you ask. There had been rumors during the 1950's that we were on the brink of overcoming gravity. Then all talk of anti- gravity disappeared, which Gook saw as a clear signal that anti-gravity research had gone black budget. Cook took as gospel the letter from General Nathan F. Twining, dated 23 September 1947, stating that flying discs are \"real and not visionary or fictitious,\" but Cook fo- cused on a section of Twining's letter UFO researchers have tended to ignore. \"It is possible within the present U.S. knowledge-provided extensive detailed development is undertaken-to construct a piloted aircraft which has the general description of the object in subparagraph (e) above which would be capable of an approximate range of 7000 miles at subsonic speeds.\" (From Edward U. Condon, Scientific Study of Unidentified Flying Ob- jects, _p. 895) Cook takes these words to mean that already in 1947, scientific research had developed at least the theory be- hind anti-gravitational propulsion. As Cook carries out his decade long quest for the truth, he eventually concludes that there is a connection between anti-gravity and the background energy of the universe, or Zero Point Energy, which when tapped would give an unlimited supply of pollution free energy for humanity. Cook also concludes that the basic scientific discovery of Zero Point Energy happened in German scientific labo- ratories during the Nazi era, and that when the war was over, the United States and the Soviet Union both rushed to collect this German technology for their own use. America collected the Zero Point prize. Cook also believes it is possible that some anti-gravitational power is used in the B-2 Stealth Bomber. And another advanced plane, Aurora, \"was supposedly a sleeper site' used by the Pentagon for burying B-2 funds at a time when the Stealth Bomber was still highly classi- fied.\" (p. 126) We in MUFON need to keep the size of the United States black budget in perspective: \"in 1988, the total was computed to be $30 billion for R&D and secret weapons programs-more than the entire annual defence budget of a major European NATO nation such as Britain, France or Germany.\" (p. 127) What this means is, there is a huge amount of money to create our own UFQs, which may indeed imitate in many ways, if not equal, UFOs that may be extraterres- trial. Cook's book is a personal story which is perhaps the only way he could tell it. As part of the story, it is interest- ing to see the fear that some scientists have of the Ameri- can secrecy network, the fear they have for themselves, and their families. As Cook interviews scientists from, let us say, Lockeed Martin, the scientists always have a com- pany representative there to watch-a keeper, as Cook calls them. Cook's book reminds us that we do live in a national security state, and there is no way to solve the UFO mys- tery apart from this issue. Richard M. Dolan has rightly framed UFOs as first of all a national security issue, not a scientific mystery, as MUFON would prefer. Cook even suggests that our own national security techniques have to some extent been copied from the German SS, which at the end of World War II had become a state within a state. If Zero Point Energy has been discovered, there are also economic issues: would the American government- or any government-be willing to let our petroleum-based economy be displaced by an energy economy which would essentially be free? I wish I could highly recommend Cook's book, but I cannot. At the same time, it is not a book UFO research- ers can ignore. Fortean Times reviewer Kevin McClure does not like the book at all, saying it has \"no index, no sources, no Point!\" The lack of index and cited sources does make it diffi- cult to go back through the book and recheck points Cook has made. But it is not true to say the book has no point. The point of the book is clear: the United States is spend- ing billions of dollars on scientific projects the American people know nothing about. In Nazi Germany, the wrong kind of people held all the secrets. How do we know the same is not true in America? •True, Cook did not prove that American secret sci- ence has discovered Zero Point Energy, but the Ameri- can system is set up to make sure hie does not make that discovery. Or that we would discover the truth about UFOs. I wondered as I read Cook's book if it were written as an extension of the defense industry-that Cook is Jane's version of Philip Klass-to show us that the extraterres- trial hypothesis concerning UFOs is not true because all the real high tech UFOs are human in origin. We might also see Cook's book in opposition to Philip Corso's The Day After Roswell. Whereas Corso says a crashed UFO at Roswell gave us, through reverse engi- neering, much of our modern technology, Cook suggests we gleaned much of our modem technology from the Germans. Together Cook and Corsb make a good disinformation team. In the Epilogue to his book, Cook says, \"I should add that this book is in (sic) npt intended to be a catch-all explanation for UFOs... the subject is too complex, too multifarious, ir» my opinion, to conform to a single expla- nation.\" (p. 276) It seems strange to me that this issue was not dis- cussed at the beginning of his book, rather than at the end. The first book in his bibliography is Timothy Good's Above Top Secret, but that is the only UFO book listed. The others deal mainly with scientific theory, and even more with German technology during World War II. In his review, Kevin McClure complained that Cook used unnamed sources. But we in the UFO field under- stand the need to protect the identity of witnesses. Until further information is available, I am inclined to believe Cook did his best to pry open the box of secrets that the American government spends billions to keep locked up. October 2002 MUFON UFO Journal Page 17"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"View from Britain By Jenny Randies Jennv Randies ••, \":'' New horizons in Wales t. Crqeso i Gogledd Cymru (Eng. Trans: Welcome to North Wales) This fall has been marked for me by a major house move. For various reasons (including the health of my elderly mother) we have bought a property by the coast in North Wales. For those outside the UK, I should point out that this move is rather more ... . .. , than a simple one from county to county or state to state, ft involves moving countries! Whilst Wales is, of course, very much part of Britain and the UK, it is also to an increas- ing extent an independent na- tion. It has its own parliament and its own language, which, whilst its use is not compulsory (everyone speaks English as a primary tongue) is being rigor- ously employed on all road signs, official documents, and a myriad other trappings of nationhood. So the locals do appreciate those incomers who make some effort. Hence my surely baffling intro- duction-which, I can tell you, will be little more compre- hensible to 99% of my fellow Brits-including most resi- dents of Wales. . New enthusiasm Making such a move affords the opportunity for me to revivify my UFO enthusiasm, for I arrive into a land that has some wild and beautiful scenery and a rich heritage of UFO encounters that I can look forward to getting to know much better than I do right now. So I thought I would describe some of the things that I know up front, about UFOlpgy in North Wales, and as I learn more of my new surroundings in the months to come I may from time to time let you know what I discover. The first thing that instantly springs to my mind about this region of the UK is that it was the location of a series of extraordinary close encounters that took place during the late 1970s, and which became the subject of only the second book that I ever wrote. As this was never pub- lished outside of the UK (although paradoxically it did get interest,from two separate movie producers in Califor- nia), I will report a little about these events. . & Family ties The family in question lived in a small village in Flintshire not far from the English border. I came into contact with the case when seeing brief reports in the local media about the events that had befallen one of the children (a young girl) who claimed to have observed a landed UFO in a field and watched as two small humanoid figures (one male, one female) dug soil samples out of the ground. There is something of the;innocence of childhood UFOlogy in that tale. Where are today's cases of such exploratory and amicable encounters? They seem to have vanished beneath a torrent of fierce abductions and rec- tal probes, which in those days were simply unheard of- certainly in the UK. •.. :; My interest in this .case (that developed into the book Alien Contact-Neville Spearman, 1981) grew as I met the family and talked to them and realised how ordinary they were. Yet they were experiencing such incredible things on a regular basis that it really brought home the oddness of this subject we have.chosen to investigate. But I also saw how it turned into a real family affair when the girl's brother and sister saw things too, and their mother started to report her own sightings of UFOs in the local skies. The case is still remarkable for me in many ways. It was, in a sense, an abduction. The girl did describe an out-of-body style trip to view an alien zoo of all things. And the aliens (whose names were, even given to her as Arna and Pars) were more like her friends than invaders. No cool-hearted greys were this bunch. Whilst she was regressed (before I even became in- volved) at the behest of ,a newspaper reporter, her hyp- notic account was a marvel of understatement. It added nothing dramatically new, and was not riddled with child- ish fantasy or invention. It was remarkably like a descrip- tion of the events-no more, no less. Those who think ab- ductions are created by regression hypnosis should read up on this case.  . . I have never really fully integrated this very strange case into my ideas about UFOlogy. There are good rea- sons for that. I know that the family grew in such a.way that these experiences did not have the impact on their later lives that you might expect. Indeed I know that they came to doubt (as did I) that this should have ever been turned into a book whilst these kids were all still at school. At the time it seemed the right thing to do, and we were all agreed on the action. Indeed the family insisted that I use their real names and read each chapter as I wrote it. But I think that they were naive about UFOlogy, just as was I. And I trust that I would not do the same thing if the case was happening now. I would think more about the long-term consequences. This is made more difficult for me because I have met the girl quite a few times now that she is an adult. Indeed she married someone whom I happen to know. But I have never revealed her married name because she simply pre- fers to live her life away from those events of all those Page 18 MUFON UFO Journal October 2002"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"years ago-even though she certainly does not deny them. I am conscious of how I affected her early life by pur- suing this case and writing about it largely out of my own desire to learn new things about UFOlogy. It was a re- sponsibility that I understood far less 20 years ago than I do now, and it makes me only too aware of how much we UFOlogists have to consider that what to us is just an interesting case is to other people an integral part of their whole life. The night the mountain exploded Another reason I think of North Wales is because of the odd things that went on in a place called Llandrillo (a small village between Corwen and Bala, about 40 miles east of where I now live). On a winter's night in January, 1974, locals felt the earth shake, and went outside to observe lights in the sky above Cader Bronwen, a local mountain, and saw mov- ing glows above the mountain itself. It became a minor news story, reporting that the RAF were searching for something up there, but exactly what was never made clear, and the story was soon dropped in much the way that the Roswell saga was rapidly aborted when it first occurred. However, this event came just as I was getting in- volved in UFOlogy, and my interest was piqued by a very odd bunch of people-a group calling themselves APEN (Aerial Phenomena Enquiry Network)- who got in on the act. APEN claimed to be a super secret agency that had access to technology and equipment that UFO groups could only dream about, as well as a hotline to top cases. They came over in the letters and tapes that they sent to UFOlogists during the 1970s and early 1980s as being an American-led body, funded to a huge degree, and in pursuit of UFOs extremely covertly. They never revealed real identities or gave addresses in their communications, but often tried to implicate known UFOlogists (myself included) in their actions. Indeed they were quite insidious at this. In retrospect it is obvious that this was a scam by some people who used UFOlogy to play games. But in those early days of my youthful enthusiasm for all things UFO it was easy to take them more seriously than I guess they deserved. APEN in turn took the events at Llandrillo far more seriously than any other UFOlogists did at the time. To us the case was considered to be the result of an earthquake (one was recorded on seismographs at the time) and a meteor (a bright one was seen all over the UK that same night), as well as possibly earth lights generated by the tectonic activity in the Welsh rocks. But APEN said otherwise. This was an alien landing, their reports alleged, thus creating a legend that has sim- mered for almost 30 years My personal interest in this case was intense, and the reasons were three-fold. Firstly, because I took geology ai college I was intrigued by theearthlights theory, which I was beginning to see as relevant to UFO sightings in my local Pennine Hills. Secondly, my boyfriend's family by pure chance owned a caravan at Llandrillo, and from 1978 onward we spent a lot of time in the area, allowing me to talk to locals about the case. It was well remembered, and was to them some- thing truly weird. Thirdly, the only earthlight I have ever seen was during one of the stays in the trailer park at Llandrillo-a smoky light rising up from the mountain side as if being squeezed out of the rocks. I never took seriously the alien stories. None of the locals ever told me anything that fit in with this legend, and all they said matched the earthlight, meteor, earth- quake theory perfectly. So this was a case I considered interesting for personal ,but not exactly anything signifi- cant. Yet today things are very different. Since the mid 1990s something of a cottage industry has grown up around this long forgotten sighting. Witnesses have come forward, much as they have years after Roswell, alleging odd things about that night, including the (to me) highly dubious claim that an alien body was recovered from the crash site and taken to a research site at Porton Down. The case is now an irrevocable part of British UFO folklore. Yet to UFOlogist Andy Roberts it is not even what I long thought it was. Determined to shoot down these UFO crash stories, he spent some days investigat- ing the case 25 years on, and believes he solved the lights above the mountain. These were flashlight beams from poachers he reveals by plotting their position into maps after very clever fieldwork. Yes, there was an earthquake. Yes, there was a me- teor. But to him, no UFO-not even of the earthlight vari- ety. His research, I have to say, is very good, and I have little reason to question it. But others surely will forever do so, eager to believe that this case cannot be so readily dismissed-and I doubt this case will die. I learned an important lesson from this incident. Never assume that a UFO is a UFO. It can always turn out to be something else, even if it takes a quarter of a century to prove it. There are, of course, many other strange cases from North Wales. This is an area rich in UFO activity. I hope to learn more about some of those that remain unsolved. Indeed, who knows-maybe this time I will get to see one close at hand. If I do then you will be the first to know! 2002 Symposium Proceedings The MUFON 2002 International UFO Sym- posium Proceedings book is now available from MUFON Headquarters for $25 + $2.50 p&h (U.S.).

Friedman Regarding Bob Lazar For thirteen years I have been asked what I thought of the Bob Lazar story. Presumably people thought that since he was claiming to be a nuclear physicist, and since I am one, I should know. Therefore, I have done a great deal of checking. I dis- cussed the problem briefly in TOP SECRET/MAJIC, and there is more information at my website www.v-j- enterprises.com/sfpage.html. I am still being asked, so it may be helpful for me to review the situ- ation. The claims, if true, would be very important. Bob claimed he had an MS degree in Physics from MIT and an MS degree in Electronics from California Insti- tute of Technology (CLT), that he had been a physicist for Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL), that Dr. Edward Teller had gotten him a job as a scien- tist back-engineering UFOs at the infamous S-4 facility at Area 51- in Nevada, and that he had figured out that the UFO pro- pulsion system involved element 115. Los Alamos had 500 pounds of 115, and he had sup- posedly managed to steal some of it, but it was taken back. There had supposedly been attempts on his life be- cause he was talking about such highly classified infor- mation. As evidence of his claims, a copy of a page from the LANL phone book was provided which has his name on it. A W-2 tax form from the Department of Naval Intelli- gence was shown. It was for under $1000. Supposedly all of Bob's academic records had been wiped out by the government. Bob comes across quite well in his videos, and his story was being touted by pilot John Lear and Las Vegas newsman George Knapp, certainly one of the most Ufologically knowledgeable journalists in the country. I had a call from Gene Huff, Bob's close associate, asking'if I would be interested in meeting with Bob in Las Vegas, where I would be speaking at the 1989 MUFON Symposium. I said certainly, and told Gene where I would be staying and when 1 would arrive. No further contact. On another trip there I hoped to have dinner with Bob and Gene and George. No Bob. Gene asked what it would take to convince me Bob was legitimate. I sent him cop- ies of my diplomas, a resume, listings from professional groups, and a list of my technical papers. I had one phone conversation with Bob (at the request of radio host Chuck Harder, during which Bob mentioned Pierce Junior College, and said he would send a resume.. 1 sent him stuff, but received nothing back. I decided, as the noise level rose, to increase my searching. Over the years I have spoken with the Alumni Office, Registrar, Physics Department, custodian of MS Theses, and the Commencement Office at MIT. All were nega- tive. I also spoke with the MIT Legal Counsel. The claim had been made that the US government had erased all of Bob's education records. This made no sense. People checked yearbooks. No Lazar. The Counsel said there was no way every mention of somebody who had re- ceived his MS there could be wiped out. I contacted Cal Tech. No records. Ditto for Calif. State U. at Northridge. But I did find out from Pierce Junior College that Bob had taken some course there in the late 1970s. I checked with the American Physical Society, to which most physicists belong. He had never belonged. At a public presentation in Rachel, NV, Bob, when asked when he got his MS from MIT, said, \"I think it was probably 1982.\" Everybody who gets an MS in Physics from MIT knows when he got it. He was asked to name former profs. He said, \"Let me see now. Bill Duxler will remember me from the Physics Dept. at Cal Tech.\" I managed to locate Dr. Duxler, who was indeed a professor of physics. He had never taught at California Institute of Technology, but had been at Pierce Junior College for many years. Bob had taken one of his courses-at the very same time he was supposedly 2500 miles away at MIT earning his MS! No undergrad school has been mentioned, so that is a solid five years mini- mum. Nobody who can go to MIT goes to Pierce Junior College. The page from the Los Alamos National Laboratory phone book clearly states that the directory includes em- ployees of the Dept. Of Energy, LANL, several other companies, and Kirk Mayer Corp. After Bob's listing is K/M. He worked for Kirk Mayer, a subcontractor to the lab, and not for the lab. He worked at an accelerator that had loads of visiting researchers from all over the world. They needed technicians. Bob was apparently one of them. I talked to somebody from the same department. Loads of unclassified physics research. I talked to the Person- nel department, giving them Bob's name, Social Security number, DOB, and the name of an old colleague who 1 knew worked at LANL for many years. They found my guy, but no Bob. I was communicating with George Knapp, and he gave me the name of Bob's High School in Westbury, NY. I contacted them and found that Bob had not graduated with his class, but later that summer, implying some course, or courses, had to be made up. He had taken one chem- istry course, but no other science courses, and he finished in the bottom third of the class. MIT normally takes people Page 20 MUFON UFO Journal October 2002"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"from only the top 10-20 % of their high school classes. George prepared a request from Bob to the-school for a transcript. It was sent. Supposedly no response was ever received.. • It should be noted that George had been under the im- pression that almost everybody working at LANL was a scientist, and that anybody having a security clearance was one-as well. It turns out that at most large R and D labs fewer than 40% of the employees are scientists, but that secretaries, technicians, plumbers, electricians, jani- tors, etc all have to have clearances because they may have access to classified areas. When Bob declared bankruptcy in Las Vegas in 1986, owing about $300,000, he listed his occupation as self employed film processor, and indeed he had purchased, but not paid for, expensive film processing equipment. No mention was made of employment at Los Alamos. Meanwhile, others had been checking on Bob as well: Michael Lindemann, Ralph Steiner, and a Stanford scien- tist interviewed Bob. He couldn't answer any of the tech- nical questions. The scientist said he expected Bob wouldn't show for the next day's session. He didn't. Tom' Mahood put together a time line with background info. Bob wasn't checking out at all.. Well, what about the gravity wave amplification sys- tem using element 115? Sounded exotic. Bob's story-has c lunged several times, but basically he had claimed that Loi A lames had collected 500 pounds of E-115, and that he had stolen some, and it had been recovered. This is stuff, if it were real, that would have been po- tentially far more valuable than weapons grade plutonium or enriched uranium. This is accountable material inven- toried quite often, and very difficult to obtain, or Saddam would have bought plenty of stolen material already. More significantly, every bit of physics we know tells us that all elements over atomic number 100 are radioac- tive, the more protons in the nucleus above 100, the shorter the half life, as a general rule. There has been for de- cades talk of an island of relative stability as one moves up the periodic table. This does not mean STABLE. But from a physicist's viewpoint, a material with a half life of a millisecond (thousandth of a second) is quite stable as compared to one with a micro-second (millionth of a second) half life, but still there is no way to accumulate pounds or even grams of such a material. Huge accelerators have been used to fuse certain ac- celerated heavy isotopes with stationary even heavier nu- clei. The quantities produced of the new isotopes aren't pounds or micrograms, but more like billionth of a billionth of a millionth of a gram. Bob talked about adding protons as though it were like adding sugar to a cake recipe. It is extremely difficult to overcome the repulsion of the nucleus with 115 protons to another proton without a huge accel- erator. No such device is noted. I certainly can't claim everything Bob has ever said is a lie. But he has been guilty of gross misrepresentation with regard to his background and his proposed UFO pro- pulsion scheme. He does come across well, he is bright, he did operate a jet powered car, he has put on large fireworks displays, and he has admitted helping to pro- cure women for a brothel in Las Vegas. Finally, I keep getting asked why would he lie? My answer is that I am not a psychiatrist. I don't know why serial rapists, serial killers, persons who sexually molest young children do what they do. We know from the evi- dence that they do. Bob certainly isn't the only person in ufology who has claimed nonexistent credentials. For example, there was William Spaulding claiming a BS in Physics from Bowling Green State U. His only education after high school was a few months at Griswald Technical Institute-no certifi- cate. Guy Kirkwood (A.K.A. Mel Noel and Noel Brice Cornwell) claimed to have been a captain in the USAF and a fighter pilot who took gun camera pictures of UFOs and who also flew DC-8s for several years for United. He had only a pilots license for single engine aircraft and was never a pilot in the USAF. The supposed PhDs of \"Dr.\" Frank Stranges and \"Dr.\" Dan Fry are mail order diplomas. Maybe Bob wanted to show up people who had de- grees and thought they were brighter than he. He did make money from selling his video tapes. He almost made close to a half million dollars from a movie company that was going to make a major film about his exciting life. I have suggested the Title: \"The Impostor.\" Do I think there are flying saucers at Area 51? It is a logical place for them to be, and for testing all sorts of new propulsion ideas that they might stimulate. After all, it is where the U-2, SR-71, Stealth aircraft etc were de- veloped. A whole host of advanced and often peculiar looking Unmanned Aerial Vehicles are also being devel- oped there. An advanced reconnaissance vehicle known as the Aurora is perhaps being flight tested there or in a number of other super secret facilities in the US or Australia. Secrets can indeed be kept. Black Budget programs spending billions of dollars out of the public eye are not uncommon. It doesn't appear that Bob Lazar had anything to do with them. Oct. 12-13 UFO/ET Congress of 2002, Days Inn.

Gen. \"Pete\" Worden is no lightweight nut. He has been on the cutting edge of all Star Wars initiatives, among other things. Killer asteroids \"The military is set up to spot and catalog near Earth objects (NEOs) in space and should keep track of them as a service to humankind,\" says Air Force Brig. Gen. Simon P. Worden, deputy director of operations at U.S. Space Command. That's because the same equipment that watches space for terrestrial threats like missiles could cover extraterrestrial bogies at relatively small ex- tra cost. Worden concedes there is a high \"giggle factor\" in the idea, but cautions the U.S. Aerospace Commission that the problem isn't limited to extinction-level events. An asteroid as small as 100 meters in diameter plowing into the atmosphere could release enough energy to devas- tate a wide area below, even if it never hits the surface, while a sea strike could inundate costal areas. Satellites are vulnerable to fast-moving objects as small as the dust particles left over from comets, and a bright meteor could spoof missile warning sensors with grave consequences in a tense international crisis. He could just as well be talking about UFOs. We have tried several times to get the attention of agencies like NORAD about using the data that the systems have been taking for years, even though the data isn't related to the primary mission. We are continuing to work on this. -John Schuessler STATEMENT OF OWNERSHIP, 1. Publication Title: MUFON UFO Journal 2. Publication No. 002-970 3 Filing Date October 19, 2002 4. Monthly 5.

The planet giant stays visible the rest of the night. Saturn (-0.3), retrograding in Orion, rises in the ENE about 6:30 PM in mid-November. It remains visible all night. Bright Planets (Morning Sky): Venus emerges in the ESE morning sky as twilight begins (shortly before 5 AM). The resplendent world brightens to -4.6 magnitude by month's end. Mars (1.7), in Virgo, rises shortly before 4 AM in midmonth but remains low in the ESE. Jupiter is due S at dawn. The quarter Moon lies 4 degrees above it on the 26th. Saturn stands in the WSW at dawn. Leonids Fly Again: The last great heavenly show in the Leonid meteors current 33-year cycle happens again early on the morn- ing of Nov. 19. Although rates are expected to possibly exceed 2001 levels, the full moon will wash out many of the fainter Leonids. Even though the Moon's glare inter- feres this time around, the great numbers of bright mete- ors predicted should still make this an event not to be missed. North America, especially the East Coast, is favored with a peak hourly rate of between about 2,600 and 10,000! (An earlier 2nd meteor peak is forecast for western Eu- rope.) These numbers will be somewhat tempered by moonlight. Although the maximum rate is predicted for around 5:30 AM (EST)-a rate sustained for only a short interval-the seasoned observer will begin to scan the sky around midmorning to watch the buildup toward the peak. For better viewing, look away from the brilliant Moon or block its intensity from behind a tree or structure of some kind. Check the news and the Internet for possible last-minute revisions to the predictions. Also see last year's descrip- tion of the Leonids in the October 2001 Journal. Penumbral Lunar Eclipse: As happened last May, the full moon once again passes through the Earth's faint outer shadow (penumbra) on the evening of the 20th, causing a shading of the northern part of the lunar disc. Maximum eclipse (88.6% of the Moon's diameter hidden) takes place at 8:47 PM EST, 7:47 CST, 6:47 MST, and 5:47 PST. CONTOUR Fails: The Comet Nucleus Tour (CONTOUR) probe, launched July 3, appears to have failed. Twelve days af- ter launch, the spacecraft's rocket was to have pushed the probe out of Earth's orbit; it apparently misfired or exploded, hurtling the object off course. Moon Phases: New moon-November 4 First quarter-November 11 Full moon-November 19 Last quarter—November 27 The Stars: By now, the Big Dipper has swung as low as it ever gets in mid-northern latitudes. At 9 PM it rests on the northern horizon, its open bowl facing up. As the Summer Triangle descends into the W, the first winter star patterns emerge in the E. Orion the Hunter, his nemesis Taurus the Bull, Gemini the Twins, and Au- riga the ChariotDriver all have ascended above the hori- zon by 9 PM.
