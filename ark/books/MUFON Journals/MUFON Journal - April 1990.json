FROM THE EDITOR This issue we catch up on our Current Case Log, Carol and Rex Salisberry report on a strange swirl found in vegetation near Gulf Breeze, Florida, and all our departments make their regular appearances. Now, if we could just get back to our regular publishing schedule! Meanwhile, for those who have written in and found some of the new format confusing, a word about Bob Cribble's \"Looking Back\" column: The column always refers to the same month as the Journal in which it appears. Thus, in this issue, it begins with April of 1950 (forty years ago). A black box at the head of a subsequent paragraph represents an entirely separate sighting, but one which also occurred in the same year (and month). Thereafter, only the changes in years will be indicated, in bold type, as in 1955, 1960, 1965, and so on. Again, all incidents in a given column will have occurred during the same month in which it appears, regardless of the year involved. IN THIS ISSUE SWIRLED LANDING TRACE?

By Carol & Rex Salisberry The Gulf Breeze plot continues to thicken. For additional recent sightings in the area, consult this issue's Current Case Log. The following report concerns itself with a circle of swirled grass first found on November 15th of last year. Parallels, as well as differences, with the English \"crop circle\" phenomenon are obvious. There have been no reports of UFO sightings in the area of the possible landing site since 2 November 1989. However, it is possible that sightings have occurred but have not been reported. The Gulf Breeze Sentinel published a report of the finding of the swirl in the Thanksgiving week issue, and it was hoped that this article might stimulate the reporting of possible sightings. One sighting was reported for the evening of 15 November, which was after the discovery of the possible landing site was reported. Chronology At about 10:00 a.m. on 15 November 1989, an unidentified caller reported his discovery of a swirl in the grass at Shoreline Park to WEAR TV in Pensacola. Mr. Gene Kirkconnell, an employee of WEAR, took the call and recorded the information. Mr. Kirkconnell related that the caller had a spry, young, male voice, and guessed the caller's age to be in his 20's or 30's. The man related that he had seen reports of swirls in the grass having been found in England and believed that he might have discovered one in Shoreline Park. He gave directions on how to find the swirl and hung up without providing his identity. Mr. Kirkconnell shared the informa- tion with Mr. Mark Curtis, also an employee of WEAR, who has previously been active in reporting UFO phenomena for his employer. During the evening of 15 November, Mr. Curtis passed the information to Mr. Ed Walters, a resident of Gulf Breeze whose extensive UFO ex- periences have been reported to MUFON. During the morning of Thursday, 16 November, Mr. Walters called the Editor of the Gulf Breeze Sentinel, Mr. Duane Cook, to report the swirl, and to request that Mr. Cook accom- pany him to find the site. Mr. Walters stated to the investigators that he did not want to visit the scene alone because of safety considerations, (there is a swampy area just to the north of the site which is probably snake infested) and to avoid undue criticism of himself, i.e., that he might somehow be responsible for the swirl. Mr. Cook and Mr. Walters took cameras and a ladder to the scene to inspect the site and to take photos for the newspaper. (Copies of these photos were provided to the in- vestigators and are included with the report.) Mr. Walters also reported the discovery of the swirl to Mr. Charles Flannigan, Pensacola MUFON Direc- tor, who assigned the case to the in- vestigators. Mr. Cook and Mr. Walters are the first visitors to the scene who have been identified. At approximately 9:30 a.m. on Friday, 17 November, Mr. Walters, ac- companied by Mr. Robert Reid, a resi- dent of Ft. Walton Beach, again visited the site. Mr. Reid attempted to duplicate the swirl in a grassy area similar to that of the original area. A video tape was made of this attempt. Additional color photos were made at the same time. The investigators, in the company of Mr. Ray Griffin of Gulf Breeze, first visited the site about mid-day on Saturday, 18 November. Photographs were made and an inspection of the immediate area was accomplished, but it was evident that the initial con- ditions at the site had been com- promised by the numerous visitors to the scene. The investigators went to Ed Walters examines Gulf Breeze swirl site.

On Tues- day, 21 November, at about 1 p.m. the investigators again returned to the scene with Mr. Dan Mullins of the Santa Rosa County Extension Service. Site Description Mr. Walters'Description: When Mr. Cook and Mr. Walters searched for the location, they had some difficulty in finding it. They at first thought that they would need to approach it from the swampy area to the north, but soon gave that up as impractical. They next walked along the beach until they came to the sign indicating the end of the park and as described by the anonymous person who first reported the swirl to WEAR. They searched around the im- mediate vicinity of the sign for a time without success and then widened their search back to the east along the way that they had come. Mr. Cook was the first of the two to find the swirl and called Mr. Walters to the spot. Both were careful so as not to disturb the scene and hamper investigation. Mr. Walters described the circle as being uniformly 7 feet 8 inches in diameter. The grass inside of the circle was swirled in a consistent clock-wise direction with the spirals becoming gradually tighter toward the center. The center itself contained a clump of finer-bladed grass than the rest of the circle, which was coiled very tightly. The grass outside of the circle was undisturbed, with a sharp line of demarcation between it and the grass inside of the circle, which was uniformly matted down. He could see no evidence outside of the circle to indicate that it might have been man- made, e.g. a path leading to the site or grass being trampled down from the use of equipment. He inspected the interior of the circle for physical evidence of man's intervention and could find none. He was particularly attentive to the center of the circle and lifted the coiled grass (see photo) to see if the ground had been disturbed by some physical object. They found no evidence of same. When Mr. Walters and Mr. Reid returned to the site on Friday, they at- tempted to make a swirl in grass similar to that where the original was found, to assess the difficulty and feasibility of such an effort. (This at- tempt was recorded on video tape.) Mr. Walters is convinced that it would take significantly more effort than they exerted to duplicate the original swirl. The grass would not lay flat but would spring back up as soon as pressure was taken off of it. Because of this attempt and the lack of other physical evidence, he believes it improbable that the original swirl was man-made. He also doubts that the swirl occur- red from natural phenomena, e.g., a whirlwind or a water spout, since there was no evidence of a track of such phenomena arriving or leaving the scene. He offers no other opinion on how the swirl could have been made. Mr. Cook's Description: Around mid-day on Thursday, 16 November, Mr. Walters called to relate the news of the discovery and to ask that Mr. Cook accompany him to the scene. Mr. Cook agreed and they went to Shoreline Park that afternoon to in- spect the site and to take photos. They had some difficulty in finding the location, but Mr. Cook eventually spotted it in the high grass. He could see no paths leading up to it or any other man-made disturbances in the surrounding grass. The swirl itself was a sharply de- fined circle in the high grass, with the grass outside of the circle standing un- disturbed and that inside lying flat in a clock-wise spiral. The spirals of grass gradually tightened toward the center with the exact center (of much finer grass than the rest of the circle) coiled very tightly. He observed and photographed lifting the center coil to check for disturbances in the ground underneath. He related that-neither he nor Mr. Walters could find any evidence of physical disturbance to the ground inside or outside of the cir- cle. Mr. Cook would offer no opinion as to how the swirl was created, but indicated that he is reluctant to believe that it was either man-made or created by weather phenomena. Mr. Reid's Description: Mr. Reid received a call from Mr. Walters dur- ing the morning of 16 November, and agreed to accompany Mr. Walters to the scene the following morning. They arrived at the park on Friday morning at about 9:30 a.m. and took some color photos and video tape of MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 264 April 1990"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"the site. Mr. Reid described the swirl as a sharply defined circle in the grass which they measured to be uniformly 7 feet 8 inches in diameter. Outside of the circle the grass ap- peared straight and undisturbed while inside it was uniformly matted down in a clock-wise spiral. The center of the circle, where finer bladed grass was located, was coiled very tightly. He could see no physical distur- bance either inside or outside of the circle to indicate that the swirl was man-made, although he could see the indentations in the sand where Mr. Cook and Mr. Walters had used a step-ladder the day before while tak- ing pictures. He and Mr. Walters at- tempted to create a swirl in a near- by patch of similar grass by trampling it down with their feet, but even after considerable effort he deemed the process to be unsuccessful. The grass would tend to spring back up and not lay flat as in the case of the original swirl. Mr. Reid does not believe that the original swirl was man-made or caus- ed by weather phenomena since there is no physical evidence to in- dicate either. He could not, however, offer any other explanation as to how the swirl was created. The Investigation The center itself contained a clump of finer-bladed grass than the rest of the circle, which was coiled very tight- ly. The grass outside the cir- cle was undisturbed, with a sharp line of demarcation between it and the grass in- side of the circle, which was uniformly matted down. The investigators first visited the scene in the early afternoon of Satur- day, 18 November. It was apparent that there had been numerous visitors to the scene, since there was a path leading from the beach to the site and the grass around the swirl had been somewhat trampled down. It was still evident, however, that there was a sharp line of demarcation between the standing grass outside of the circle and the flattened clock-wise spiral of grass inside. The center was still a tight coil, although it was apparent that the coil had been disturbed by other persons. The center of the circle was located 37 feet to the NNW from the closest point of the high water line on the beach. It measured to be uniformly 7 feet 8 inches in diameter. The grasses all seemed to be bent over at ground level although the ground was uneven with the NW sector being slightly lower than the other area inside of the circle. The growth of heavier bushes and foliage begins about 8-10 feet to the NNW of the circle. A search for debris, which might have been ejected from the swirl, was made of the surrounding area. Two pieces of house-wall insulation were found to the NNW at about 20 feet from the center of the circle. The pieces were 4 x 12 inches and were supported about a foot above the ground by the underlying foliage. MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 264 April 1990"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Attempt by Cook and Walters to recreate swirl. Subsequently, a search for similar debris was made for a distance of 500 yards along the beach. Only one other incidence of debris supported by the underlying foliage was found. This again involved housing insulation of the same type, and a larger quan- tity of the insulation material was found lying on the ground just to the south of the second location. It is noteworthy that the Gulf Breeze/Pensacola area suffered severe storms during the night of 15 November which could account for the presence of the debris as it was found. No Radiation Mr. Donald Ledberter of the Santa Rosa County Radiology Office was taken to the scene during the after- noon of 20 November to check for residual radiation. A CD 700 Meter, manufactured by the Victoreen Instru- ment Company of Cleveland, Ohio, was used. The instrument was last calibrated in June of 1988 and fresh batteries were installed prior to the survey. A background check was made in a ten foot circle around the center of the swirl. No evidence of residual radiation was detected. Mr. Dan Mullins of the Santa Rosa County Extension Service was taken to the scene during the afternoon of 21 November. When he first saw the swirl he remarked that it appeared that it might have been caused by a whirlwind. He later admitted, however, that he had never personally examined a swirl caused by a whirl- wind and could not now state that a whirlwind was the cause of the swirl in question. He thoroughly examined the grasses both inside and outside of the swirl and could find no damage to either roots or stems of the plants. He also noted that even the blades on the grass were intact which would not have been probable had the grass been flattened by a physical object of some sort. He took numerous soil samples from both inside and outside of the affected area and a report will be submitted to the investigators when the analysis is completed. The investigators last visited the site on Monday, 27 November. The grasses in the original swirl were still flattened down and appeared to be alive and healthy. The grasses in the swirl created by Mr. Walters and Mr. Reid have recovered significantly toward their original vertical positions. When first made this swirl bore only slight resemblance to the original and now even that is gone. Mr. Cook was interviewed in his of- fice at the Gulf Breeze Sentinel on 28 November. Mr. Walters was inter- viewed briefly in-person at Shoreline Park on 20 November and twice by telephone. Mr. Reid was interviewed by telephone on 30 November. Mr. Cur- tis, Mr. Kirkconnell and others were in- terviewed by telephone. The photos at- tached to this report were provided by' Mr. Cook and Mr. Walters. The investigators have seen swirls similar to this one on Dead Man's Island (on the north side of Gulf Breeze) during the summer and fall of 1988. They took scant notice of them at the time since they were not then involved with MUFON and UFO investigations. The investigators agree with the three primary witnesses that, although it might be possible for this swirl to have been man-made, the probability of such origin is slight. The probability of the swirl being caused by weather, phenomena is also judged to be small, in that the circle just seems too perfect to be the product of mother nature. A whirlwind or water spout would have needed to arrive and depart with great precision to achieve the results in evidence. No conclusions can be drawn from the debris found in the immediate area of the swirl. There is a high probability that it was deposited in the bushes dur- ing the storm of 15 November or a previous one. If the material had been deposited during the formation of the swirl, it would be difficult to hypothesize a trajectory since the debris is of such low density. Evaluation: Unknown, Significant (Possible Landing Trace) MUFON MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 264 April 1990"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"MJ-12: Rebutting a \"Rebuttal By Stanton T. Friedman 99 I am frankly astonished at Robert Todd's 35-paragraph \"MJ-12 Rebuttal\" (Ref. 1) with its repeated ad hominem at- tacks and its massive misrepresenta- tion of both my views and the facts concerning MJ-12. It seems strange indeed that the only one of my many papers (Ref. 2-9) referenced is a brief progress report (Ref. 9) to the Fund For UFO Research not even intended for publication! Surely no reasonable person can consider Todd's tirade as a \"rebuttal,\" which would make it a refutation of arguments made by me, not of false ones dreamed up by Todd and put in my mouth. Let me be specific about some of his false charges. • Todd claims that I want and ex- pect people to believe that: a) Ele- ments within MJ-12 had me under surveillance; b) MJ-12 ordered the CT memo stolen; c) MJ-12 ordered the CT memo planted; d) that MJ-12 then went to Ethiopia to pick up postcards; and e) that MJ-12 flew to New Zealand to mail these postcards!! What an imagination, since I have written none of these. The post office box 189 was added to the postcard. I would think that Todd is aware that postcards can be sent from one place to another in envelopes. • Todd further claims that Moore and Shandera (M/S) weren't at the National Archives (NA) to find the CT memo. They were certainly there because the postal cards (read to me over the phone as we tried to solve the riddles thereon) and my input strongly indicated they should go to Washington, DC. They did not realize that the \"Box 189, Addis Ababa\" was a tipoff to Box 189 in which the memo was found. Todd neglects to mention that I visited the Archives in March of 1985, and had a number of subsequent con- versations with Jo Ann Williamson and her boss, Edwin Thompson, Director of the Records Declassifica- tion Division at the NA, as well as with Ed Reese. Todd doesn't mention that there were at least half a dozen 4-person teams of USAF reservists, with the highest possible clearances, spending many months reviewing the USAF HQ Intelligence files, including Box 189, and in Top Secret Facilities where they could bring briefcases; that the box was first handled just 2 weeks after the death of the last reputed surviving MJ-12 member, and last handled less than 2 weeks before it was reviewed by M/S. This is all spelled out in my 30-page 1989 MUFON Conference paper (Ref. 4) which Todd never references. The insertion, then, of a one page onionskin memo by a highly cleared USAF person is no big deal. Todd's elaborate fictional confabulation is ab- surd. M/S called me the day the memo was discovered and read it to me. • Todd claims that M/S and I had long ago identified the most likely MJ-12 people. Nonsense. Donald Menzel's name on the list was a shock that made us very wary of the docu- ment, as demonstrated by the fact that it was not released when received in Dec. 1984, or even after the discovery of the CT memo in July of 1985, but rather in the Spring of 1987. • Todd claims that M/S/F seem to feel that if a document can't be pro- ven fake, then it must be real. My ar- ticles clearly indicate the opposite, and suggest that proving the anti- arguments wrong does not make the documents genuine, as I have written over and over. I have not said the MJ-12 documents are genuine. • Todd amazingly claims that the Eisenhower Library believes the CT memo is a fake! I have made numerous visits to the EL, and have had considerable correspondence and phone conversations with them as well as with the NA which quotes the EL. No such claim has been made! I must also give the EL and the NA credit for changing one of their earlier claims (Ref. 10) that all of Robert Cutler's carbon copies were done on paper with a certain watermark, after I pointed out several onionskin Cutler memo copies having no watermark. They do make mistakes. • Since Todd has never been to the EL or NA, it is perhaps not surpris- ing that his tirade about finding other onionskin copies on the same water- mark paper as the CT memo and related comments is so foolish. I will repeat what I have published elsewhere: that the EL does not have all the NSC materials from the Ike era, and that what it does have totals at least 250,000 pages, much of which has not yet been reviewed for classification and is totally inaccessible. The titles of file folders are included in 11 different \"finders aids,\" totalling, as I recall, over 100 pages. One can order at most 18 archive boxes at a time. Only one box can be opened at a time, and only one folder can be taken out of a box at a time. Often an entire box would contain only withdrawal sheets, each listing, in very brief form, 10 or 12 docu- ments still classified. If one wants a specific document classification reviewed, (i.e., Lay-to-Cutler memo, secret, July 16, 1954, 1 page) one lists it on long form. Within a week or two the EL will file a formal request for mandatory classification with the appropriate agency (CIA, FBI, or, worst of all, the NSC). Typically, the average response time for the NSC is 2.5 years! Finally, on March 6, 1990, I re- ceived my first response dealing with the one-page Lay-Cutler, July 16, 1954, formally secret message I re- MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 264 April 1990"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"8 EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL WASHINGTON March 1?, 1953 MEMORANDUM FOR THE NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL SUBJECT; Rocommendations Regarding the National Security Council At tho direction of the President his enclosed letter and its attachments consisting of a memorandum for tho Proaidont from Mr. Cutler and his report on tha subject are circulated herewith for the Information and guidance of tho National Security Council.

This is the date of the \"previously scheduled meeting\" noted in the CT memo. The CT memo is dated July 14, 1954, the same date on which Lay (who I believe prepared the memo) met with Eisenhower at 2:30 p.m., and then had a brief telephone conversation with him at 4:35 p.m. The message (transmitted elec- tronically by White House Secretary, General Paul Carroll) reviewed the items discussed at the July 15 NSC meeting and concludes with these two lines: \"Hope you will recuperate, rest and enjoy yourself for few days before returning. Will try to have everything tidy and not too much pressure upon you when you arrive.\" Clearly Cutler and Lay were in touch and Lay was handling things for Cutler. Since the briefing says \"one-of- one,\" it hardly seems likely that a copy of it or anything else connected with MJ-12 would be at the EL. No ar- chivist there has gone though all or most of the EL NSC material. Since much of the material in the NSC files is still classified, and the EL search of Todd involved only a modest sample of unclassified materials, it is not very likely that the EL would find much for the time in question. Perhaps I should mention that the EL had also been unable to find a copy of one of the other two Cutler- Twining memos found at the Library of Congress Manuscript Division, nor of a memo Dr. Menzel claims went to Eisenhower, nor of a TS memo dated April 6, 1959, noted in a censored TS memo-to-file from Gordon Gray, same date and relating to an unspecified 5412/2 (Covert) activity. The primary job of EL archivists is to retrieve Archive boxes for re- searchers, not to paw through huge files in vaults. Perhaps Todd is unaware that all EL file folders are in typically 6\" wide, covered archive boxes, not in file drawers, and that one only sees Xerox copies of cen- sored items. O ne of Todd's worst misrepre- sentations, however, relates to the security markings on the CT memo and on others from the NSC. TOP SECRET RESTRICTED SECURITY INFORMATION is on CT (Todd neglects the SI). On a letter from Eisenhower to Cutler dated March 17, 1953, are typed \"Restricted Security Information\" at the top, \"Restricted\" at the bottom and, rub- ber stamped in large letters, \"CON- FIDENTIAL' at both top and bottom. On a memo to the NSC from Lay, same date, are rubber stamped \"RESTRICTED\" in big letters and \"SECURITY INFORMATION\" in small letters at the top and \"CON- FIDENTIAL\" top and bottom in big letters. (See previous page.) There is no downgrading stamp, only the declassification dated 2/18/82 on both items. Based on my own extensive experience with the combination of \"SECRET RE- STRICTED DATA\" and \"Confidential Restricted Data,\" if the documents had been downgraded during their working life from Confidential to Restricted SI, there would have to have been a downgrading stamp on them. If Confidential can be used with Restricted Security Information, then so can SECRET and TOP SECRET. Perhaps I should add that anybody reviewing thousands of documents at the EL or NA, or the other 12 Ar- chives I have visited, quickly becomes accustomed to a huge variety of security markings. The size of the type, whether printed or rubber stamped, the location on the paper, whether Top or Bottom or just one, all vary. Not being either psychic, as Todd seems to be, nor a psychiatrist, I cannot provide an explanation for Todd's (to use his words) \"gross deception, gross incompetence, spurious evaluations and assess- ments\" or lack of objectivity. Considering Todd has never been responsible for classified material, nor visited any archives, his lack of familiarity with procedures, document markings, etc., might be forgiven. I can find no excuse however, for the ad hominem attacks, nor for his obvious great distress concerning the documents. Me thinks he doth pro- test too much ... \"sound and fury signifying nothing.\" References 1. Todd, G. \"MJ-12 Rebuttal\" MUFON UFO Journal, No. 261, Jan. 1990, 17-20. 2.

Review- ing his appearance on the \"Larry King Live!\" TV show, I questioned whether certain remarks Ecker attributed to the late General Douglas E. MacArthur had in fact ever been made. MacArthur, as you may remember, has frequently been quoted in the UFO literature as warning that the next war would take place between a unified Earth and an extraterrestrial invader, or words to that effect. The quote reportedly occurred in the con- text of a speech made to the May 1962 West Point graduating class. Ecker reiterated this point on the King show, and I wrote that you could see his credibility (and by extension, that of ufology) running down the microphone wire and into the floor. (Guest host Pat Buchanan, sym- pathetic to that point, seemed taken aback, and strongly objected to the statement, saying he had a framed copy of the MacArthur speech hang- ing on his wall, and no such sen- timents were expressed therein.) I asked Journal readers to write in and settle the issue once and for all. Did MacArthur, or didn't he? The results are in, and clearly I owe Mr. Ecker an apology for having publicly questioned his sources. Several readers sent in the entire transcript of the graduation speech, including the General's own published recollection in his autobiography, Reminiscences (McGraw-Hill, 1964). Pennsylvania state section director, attorney Lance Payette, provided what is probably the best summary of MacArthur's remarks (pages 423-26): \"We deal now not with things of this world alone, but with the il- limitable distances and as yet un- fathomed mysteries of the universe. We are reaching out for a new and boundless frontier. \"We speak in strange terms: of harnessing the cosmic energy; ... of ultimate conflict between a united human race and the sinister forces of some other planetary galaxy; of such dreams and fantasies as to make life the most exciting of all time.\" Robert Todd furnished a copy of the original speech, as did Charles Huffer of Arkansas. But West Virginia state section director Ted Spickler pro- vided the best commentary. \"Within the context of the rest of the speech,\" he wrote, \"this slight remark seems of no significance for us today relative to the UFO issue. I saw no hint elsewhere in the book that UFO's were on his mind at all and suspect that he was only continuing through on a thought that momentari- ly carried him into outer space. We may just as well get cranked up about H. G. Wells and his novels, or any public figure expressing some curiousity about dealing with extrater- restrials at some point in the far dis- tant future.\" There were probably others who contributed as well, whose names I have neglected to mention, and to whom I also apologize. But Jim Moseley (who once met MacArthur) did write to add that even if the good General hadn't made the utterance in question, it certainly cor- related with his thinking at the time. \"He was obssessed by that sort of thing,\" says Moseley. So let the record show: I stand cor- rected, and MacArthur really did say what Ecker said he said. Space Hazards From the It-Doesn't-Hurt-to-Speculate Department, comes this interesting lit- tle item from the pages of England's New Scientist Magazine (\"This Week,\" March 3, 1990, pg. 24). It seems space travel may be more hazardous than previously suspected. In fact, a round-trip to Mars, which would involve almost 18 months in deep space, could conceivably expose astronauts to lethal doses of cosmic rays and other energetic radiation. Cosmic rays are made up mostly of protons, charged particles that pack enough energy to break up molecules and even \"mutate\" genes. In fact, some scientists theorize that cosmic rays are essential to the evolution of life on a planet like the Earth; the mutations that prove fruitful even- tually advance life forms. A constant bombardment of cosmic rays, how- ever, would prove fatal for most life. As it is, our atmosphere shields us from the constant flood of the majori- ty of such particles. In space, no such shield exists. Aluminium is known to absorb cosmic rays to an extent, but only at the cost of giving off secondary radiation in the process. Astronauts enclosed in an aluminum tube would actually be confined inside a deadly neutron flux. Ordinary water seems to be the best defensive bet, but this would require a four-inch thick layer between astronauts and outer space. Theoretically, the resulting cancer rate would be increased only two percent above Earth norms. Another drawback? Water is also notoriously heavy. Shielding against violent solar flares is even more problematic and less likely. But even if both these problems were licked, the dilemma of microgravity would still remain to threaten future spacefarers. Microgravity refers to the conditions of little or no gravity encountered once one leaves the comfy confines of one's home planet. While lack of weight may prove beneficial for a few esoteric manufacturing processes, prolonged exposure seems in the main dangerous for humans. The biological response to microgravity, in most cases, appears time-dependent, that is, the more time spent in space, the greater or more pronounced the consequences.

Muscles atrophy from the lack of resistance. Other effects may be more subtle and may affect different tissues and organisisms in different ways. Bacteria, for example, seem to divide more rapidly and reveal an increased resistance to antibiotics. Among the eukaryotic cells (those of higher organisms), however, there is less division, and the way cells specialize is altered. The proliferation of lymphocytes, those cells that attack infection, may be depressed by as much as 90 percent. A long trip through deep space, in other words, appears to take its toll on living organisms. So, maybe as the conspiracists claim, the Earth really is a Stop'n'Go on the galactic highway, and humans little more than a fast food snack. The saucers stop over for a night, fill their protective tanks with water, pick up a few blood donors without permission, extract a few sex cells at the same time, and continue on their merry way. \"Nice little place,\" they mutter as they speed out of sight. \"I'd give it two stars, for sure. But don't drink the water.\" Worse, as well as more logical, scenarios could be imagined, I'm sure. But this particular exercise explains why they never stick around for any length of time. How long, after all, do you hang around a convenience store? It does make me wonder, though, where they're off to in such a hurry. You'd think they'd at least stop and smell the roses on occasion. An alternative, of course, is that all life forms, even little gray ones, may have a hard time surviving the perils of life in space. U.S. Secrets Can the government and/or its military intelligence agencies actual- ly keep a secret, as Stanton Friedman never tires of reiterating? The numbers, at least, certainly seem to be in their favor. As of the end of the last fiscal year, according to one re- cent report, government \"censors\" wielded top secret, secret or confiden- tial rubber stamps almost 7 million times. The actual figure, derived by the Information Security Oversight Office, and as determined by depart- ment head Steven Garfinkel, comes to 6,796,501. Interestingly, this represents a 35 percent decrease in the number of secrets per year since the last such survey. According to the April 5, 1990, AP Dallas Morning News arti- cle from which I'm drawing, \"nearly all the decline came when the Navy decided it really didn't originate more secrets than the rest of the govern- ment put together.\" The article leaves us tantalized, rather than satisfied, since the Navy has long been associated, seemingly uncharacteristically, with the UFO phenomenon in general, and certain high level related projects in particular. Why were they singled out as special offenders? Unfortunately, the article offers lit- tle insight into ongoing machinations. Perhaps one of our readers would like to write for the final report and inform us in greater detail? The AP release does go on to say that there are two basic kinds of secrets so stamped: original and derivative. Garfinkel said that there were some 500,000 of the former, and approximately 6.3 million of the latter. Key hoe Award (WASHINGTON, D.C.; April 2, 1990) — A two hour television documen- tary on Unidentified Flying Objects has won first place in the Donald E. Keyhoe Journalism Award competi- tion, sponsored by the Fund for UFO Research. The documentary, entitled \"UFOs: The Best Evidence,\" was produced by George Knapp, news director at KLAS-TV, Las Vegas, NV. \"This two- hour special took an in-depth look at the current state of UFOlogy, its strengths and weaknesses, and at some of the most controversial UFO cases, documents and individual researchers, in an attempt to evaluate whether UFOs are real — and if so — what they are,\" said Knapp. \"The special originally aired as a nine-part series in our nightly newscasts. The response to the series was so great that we made it into a special program,\" Knapp added. \"The documentary was one of the best-produced television programs on the subject of Unidentified Flying Ob- jects,\" concluded the Keyhoe Jour- nalism Award Panel. \"It was especially impressive because it was put together by a local television station. But more important was the fact that it was a good piece of investigative jour- nalism.\" The panel for the award competi- tion consisted of: Don Berliner, avia- tion writer; Richard Hall, editor; and Fred Whiting, public relations ex- ecutive and former broadcast jour- nalist. Berliner, Hall and Whiting are members of the Board of Directors for the Fund for UFO Research, a non- profit organization based in Washing- ton, DC. The first place winner in the jour- nalism competition will receive a cash award of $1,000. Second place went to Kim Opatka, Staff Writer for the Latrobe (Penn- sylvania) Bulletin, for her six-part series on UFOs published May 1-4, 1989. \"The series was aimed at fostering a better public understanding of the UFO phenomenon and at abolishing misconceptions associated with the field and persons who have claimed sightings,\" said Opatka. Another local television news series, \"UFOhio,\" produced by WBNS-TV, Columbus, OH, was rank- ed third by the competition judges. The entry, which dealt with a week- long series of reports dealing with UFO activity in Ohio, was submitted by reporter Tom Berman. The station also conducted a telephone poll on UFOs, which resulted in more than 16,000 responses.

In an effort to pro- vide the most timely information possible, this report covered the final two quarters of the year. The most significant public development was the October 9 TASS account of a UFO landing in Voronezh, USSR, about 300 miles southeast of Moscow and the ap- pearance of unusual-looking aliens in the town park. The event was witnessed by a group of children. The Fund immediately received more than 50 media inquiries, which resulted in 22 interviews with a number of news outlets, including the Cable News Network. The Fund is attempting to establish contacts within the Soviet Union to get more information on this startling new development. Meanwhile, Stanton Friedman's ex- cellent behind-the-scenes research in- to the Roswell case received com- mendable attention by NBC-TV's \"Unsolved Mysteries\" program on September 20. The broadcast resulted in more than 50 new leads in the case, which Mr. Friedman is in- vestigating in connection with his research into the \"MJ-12\" documents and personalities. His research is be- ing supported by a $16,000 grant pro- vided by the Fund — the largest ever given by a private organization in UFO history. Because of these new developments, his report (which had been expected by the end of the year) will be finalized early in 1990. Fund Chairman Bruce Maccabee, Ph.D., an optical physicist and recognized expert in UFO photo analysis, is examining several videotapes of alleged UFOs shot recently on opposite sides of the world. A Japanese video of a \"Saturn-shaped\" UFO made during a daytime sighting has tentatively been categorized as \"unidentified,\" and efforts are underway to compare it with a similar object photographed in 1975. In the meantime, we are facilitating the analysis of a UFO cap- tured on videotape by a member of the Dutch Ministry of Defense while on vacation in Spain earlier in the year. Even before the TASS account and the NBC-TV report on the Roswell case, the Fund had circulated a news column on the UFO phenomenon to more than 8,000 newspapers across the USA, resulting in scores of in- quiries from the public for more information. The Fund's Board of Directors ap- proved two grant requests during this period: to Marge Christensen for $1,450 to support the publication of a report, Using Concepts From UFO Studies to Teach Science and Critical Thinking, to the National Science Teachers Association Conference on December 2, 1989; and $400 to Nigel Watson for an analysis of \"mystery helicopters\" in England. Mrs. Christensen's report, co-authored by Richard Haines, Ph.D., John Schuessler and Michael Swords, Ph.D., is now available from the Fund for a contribution of $25 or more, as long as supplies last. The Fund also is pleased to an- nounce the availability for the first time of The Gulf Breeze Sightings by Ed Walters and Frances Walters, with a foreword by Budd Hopkins. This long-awaited report was prepared with the assistance of Dr. Maccabee, whose analysis of the photos, has received critical acclaim throughout the UFO community. Special autographed copies of this just- published work, which is likely to be a classic in UFO literature, are now available for $21.95. The Executive Committee is pleased to welcome John Brand- enberg, Ph.D., a physicist living in the Washington, DC area, as an Alter- nate Member. Dr. Brandenberg has been involved in the Mars Research Project to analyze photographs of anomalous objects photographed on the surface of the Red Planet. The Ex- ecutive Committee feels his scientific background will make a splendid con- tribution to our efforts. As noted in an earlier fundraising appeal, the Fund for UFO Research faces the possibility of being without resources to deal with new develop- ments in the field, such as the Soviet landing case, the availability of UFO photographs and videotapes for analysis and continuing research in- to the Roswell crash and government involvement in the UFO question. All of our funds are committed to on- going projects.

Adamski: \"Pure Fiction?\" As those aware of UFO history know, the publication in 1953 of Flying Saucers Have Landed by Desmond Leslie and George Adamski was an event of exceptional importance to the public's awareness of UFOs. Because the controversy which followed Adamski's writings continues to this day, it may be of some value to put the comments of one of his alleged scientific witnesses on record. I located this longtime San Diego resi- dent, Gene Luther Bloom, after hav- ing by chance again read Adamski's references to him on pages 174 through 177 of Flying Saucers Have Landed. What Adamski wrote: \"Then late in 1949 four men came into the cafe at Palomar Gardens ... One of these men was Mr. J. P. Maxfield, and another was his partner, Mr. G. L. Bloom, both of the point Loma Navy (sic) Electronics Laboratory near San Diego ... \"They asked me if I would cooperate with them in trying to get photographs of strange craft moving through space ... \"They said they were going up to the top and ask for the same coopera- tion from the men at the big Observatory. \"1 asked them then where I should look to be most likely to see the strange objects which they were ask- ing me to try to photograph ... The moon was decided upon as a good spot for careful observation. \"Thus, when the military requested my cooperation in trying to photograph strange objects moving through space, with the aid of my 6-inch telescope, I was more than will- ing ... \"And it was not too long after this meeting that I succeeded in getting what I deemed to be two good pic- tures of an object moving through space ... \"Some days later Mr. Bloom stepped into the place ... I handed him the two photographs which I had taken. I asked him to pass them on to Mr. Maxfield for examination and for the records. He said he would.\" In my interview with him on July 19th, 1988, Mr. Bloom said that he and his colleague, the now deceased Joseph Maxfield, had only stopped at the cafe where Adamski worked to have lunch before continuing to the Hale Observatory to discuss subjects having nothing to do with UFOs. He said further that they were not there to ask for George Adamski's coopera- tion, and that until meeting him did not even know of his interest in fly- ing saucers. He added that neither he nor Maxfield instructed Adamski on how to photograph the saucers, nor did they accept any photographs from him for analysis by the Naval Elec- tronics Laboratory or for any other purpose. Mr. Bloom's final comment to me was that \"Everything Adamski wrote about us was fiction, pure fiction.\" — Eric Herr In Others' Words ... Lucius Parish Are some UFOs actually living creatures? Strange as that may sound, there are some reports which suggest this possibility. Speculations on this theory may be found in the March 6 issue of NATIONAL ENQUIRER. The March issue of FATE contains an article on abductee Betty Hill's claim that a UFO \"landing area\" ex- ists near her home in New Hamp- shire. Betty is apparently not the on- ly one who has seen strange things at this location. April FATE has a report on a British UFO sighting of 1977. The \"Anti-Matter/UFO Update\" section in the March issue of OMNI has Paul McCarthy's profile of the TREAT (Treatment and Research on Experienced Anomalous Trauma) project to investigate reports of UFO abductions. Zecharia Sitchin's fourth book, THE LOST REALMS, is now available in an Avon paperback edition.

Unless noted, no sound, vibration or odor was detected. • Log #891204: 11/2/89. 9:40 p.m. event in Gulf Breeze, Florida, in- vestigators Carol and Rex Salisberry. A teenage brother and sister, walking home from a convenience store, noticed two lighted bell-shaped discs moving swiftly nearby. As they stopped to stare, the vehicles likewise halted and hovered. The teens again started walking and the objects resumed their flight, only to hover once more seem- ingly in response to the witnesses stopping. Momentarily these sped out of sight and a third identical disc ap- proached, then dropped below a treeline at which point a humming sound was detected. Racing home, they convinced their mother to go outside. She also heard the sound, which continued for over a minute, though nothing further was observed. Dogs in the vicinity barked until the humming ceased. The surface of all three was described as blue-gray. White light shone on the bottom of each of the first two, while the under- side of the third displayed brighter yellowish light. The total duration was estimated as five minutes. • Log #891205: 11/15/89. discovery in Gulf Breeze, Florida, in- vestigators Robert Reid, Carol and Rex Salisberry. An unidentified caller to WEAR-TV (Pensacola) gave direc- tions to an unusual mark in a weedy area of Shoreline Park. Upon refer- ral from WEAR, the Gulf Breeze Sen- tinel editor and a companion located the site. Investigators were then called in. The site, a clockwise swirl of depressed weeds, was uniformly 7 feet 8 inches in diameter. The vegeta- tion was coiled tightly at the epicenter. No footprints or other imprints were found under the depression or leading up to the site. No debris was found outside the site which could logically be associated with a downdraft. An attempt to manually duplicate the effect in a nearby stand of weeds was unsuccessful. A radiological test conducted five days later offered no extraordinary readings. (See the article, \"Swirled Landing Trace?\" in this issue for ad- ditional details and photographs.) • Log #891206: 9/28/89. 8p.m. event over Tillamook Bay, Oregon, investigator Skip Schultz. Nine report- ing witnesses (and possibly dozens of others) observed a circle of lights, each light consisting of a ring and transparent center, moving slowly northward over the bay. An apparent thin line was observed connecting the lights. No other outline was positive- ly identified. Separately, brilliant flashes of light were seen intermittent- ly in the same area. Collateral con- tacts with military bases and a com- mercial airport ruled out conventional aircraft as a resolution. The duration was 15 minutes for the observations of individual scattered witnesses and 45 minutes in total. • Log #900103: 10/24/89, 6:15 a.m. event in northern Indiana, in- vestigator Franklin Reams. A com- mercial airline crew in flight en- countered a boomerang-shaped vehi- cle passing overhead. A vertical beam of light shone downward from the underside of the object. The object passed from view in 30 seconds. Radio communication during the in- cident was confirmed by other airline personnel. • Log #900104: 12/21/89, 12:30 a.m. event in Pensacola, Florida, in- vestigator Rex Salisberry. A man was driving across the Pensacola Bay Bridge on his way home from work when he spotted a dark cylindrical ob- ject moving very slowly in the near distance and opposite direction, perhaps 200 feet over the water. A bright beam emanated from its front. Two or three red blinking lights were centered on the underside. Total length was likened to an airliner. Hav- ing slowed his auto, the witness never- theless passed out of view after 5 minutes. Collateral contacts with military and civilian authorities failed to resolve the incident but established that the path indicated is off limits to air and ship traffic. • Log #900105: April 1987, late- night event in Pensacola, Florida, in- vestigator Joe Barron. A woman returned to bed after a bathroom visit and momentarily became aware of a brilliant light in the room. She then saw a column of white light (a rain- bow of colors within) protruding down through the ceiling, within which floated a 3-3V2 foot humanoid. The being, suspended near the ceiling throughout, was described as having an oversized head, grey skin, no hair, black almond-shaped eyes, a slit mouth, nostrils without a discernible nose and long arms. It wore a tight- fitting jumpsuit of dark olive \"fuzzy\" material which extended over both hands and feet.

A man was driving home from work when he approached a slow-moving silvery object at treetop height over the road. As he neared, he discerned a disc 40-50 feet in diameter. A crease in the surface near the rounded top was the only variation in an otherwise cone-shaped exterior. Two rows of numerous lights, each in a blue-blue- green pattern, shone steadily. One row was situated near the base, the other along the perimeter of the flat bottom. The object picked up speed and paced just above and in front of the auto for 2-3 miles, moving repeatedly left and right to avoid larger trees along the roadside. Abruptly the car's engine, lights and instruments died. The man pulled to a halt and watched as the disc con- tinued down the road, then executed a smooth turn and climbed out of sight. He was then able to restart the engine and found the electrical system operating normally. Duration was estimated as 4 minutes. [Note: The witness had previously reported sighting an identical vehicle on 10/24/88. See illust] • Log #900216: 1/22/90, 6 p.m. event near Mountain Home, Arkan- sas, investigator Lawrence Willett. A farmer was tending his stock when he noticed flashing lights in the distance. He called his wife and children out- side. As they watched, a large, dark blimp-shaped object passed slowly and nearly overhead. Clusters of red, green and white flashing lights were at either end, while a separate cluster was seemingly attached to a horizon- tal cable at one end. When almost out of sight, the object turned and re- traced its route, dropping lower and aiming powerful searchlights angular- ly to the ground. It then continued Log #900208 (1/20/90 event near Boyle, MS) on a straight path until lost from view. The family's two dogs barked con- tinuously while the vehicle was near- by. Total duration was approximately 20 minutes. Calling a nearby airport (without radar), the family was told that no large aircraft was in the area. • Log #900217: 6/10/79, 12a.m. event in Quirpon, Newfoundland, in- vestigator Michael Strainic. As a man stepped outside his home, he was greeted by a 100-foot-long object hovering over the vacant house next door. The bottom view was described as teardrop shaped with a flat under- side and dull metallic surface. A pro- minent \"tail fin\" protruded upward at one end. Near the base was a row of pink, rectangular lights that pulsated continuously. A blue flashing light was centered at the rounded top. A low humming sound was easily detected. After about one minute, the object began rotating to the right, remaining at a level attitude.

Having heard her husband's call to come outside, the wife joined him in time to see the receding lights. • Log #900221: Spring 1988, 9 p.m. event near Gulf Breeze, Florida, investigators Carol and Rex Salisbeny. A woman was driving when she came upon a dark \"arrowhead\" (or possibly boomerang) shaped object moving at jogging speed just above nearby tree- tops. Its wingspan was estimated at 150+ feet, while from the rounded nose to the apex of a flat-V rear edge appeared in excess of 100 feet. Floodlight-sized round white lights bordered the entire perimeter. The woman slowed and noticed other drivers slowing and stopping. The vehicle then passed slowly and direct- ly over her car, and through her open sunroof she realized the underside comprised sections/panels rather than a continuously smooth surface. She drove on, continuing to see it in her rearview mirror until out of range. Duration was 3-5 minutes. • Log #900302: 10/20/89, 5:10 a.m. event ensuing near Huntsville, Arkansas, investigators Edward Mazur and Lucius Farish. Two women were driving toward a distant town when a large, glowing red-orange oval ap- peared just over the ground and within 100 feet over a field and began pacing them. Within minutes, two vertical columns of white shone within the oval. One of these repeatedly moved right and left within the oval \"like a windshield wiper.\" The driver lowered the (power) rider window, and her companion snapped the first of several photos. They then stopped the car, and the light/object halted also. After a moment, it \"almost disap- peared.\" They drove off, only to have the unknown reappear and proceed alongside. With the distraction, they missed their intended turn and so drove on to the next town before turn- ing around, at which point the object had again disappeared.

Pulling to the shoulder, her rider spotted the intruder directly over the car. It proceeded over a nearby mobile home, and the rider took more photos. Driving away, the object paced their auto once more, turning with them onto the intersecting road. Nearing their destination, it disap- peared, then reappeared at other locations. A crackling sound was heard, a black streak seen, then the anomaly vanished without moving in- to the distance. Total duration was I 1 /? hours. [Notes: Initial examination of the photographs was inconclusive. In the ensuing weeks, both women suf- fered severe fatigue, irritability, lack of concentration, repeated nightmares, and an altered sense of reality consciousness.] • Log #900304: 10/23/89, 2:30 p.m. event near Smithfield, Illinois, investigator Poe Clark. Two women were driving when they spotted an object over the road perhaps a quarter-mile ahead. Described as a cylinder less than 20 feet long, the object was essentially white with a darker bottom and a haze surround- ing the upper portion. The driver stopped, and for the next few minutes they watched the object as it barely moved in the near distance. Afterbe- ing blocked by a nearby tree for 3-4 minutes, the object reappeared and glided slowly and angularly into the sky, entering one of the few clouds and was not seen again. Total dura- tion was 8 minutes. • Log #900305: 10/11/89, 11:30 p.m. event near Crestwood, Ken- tucky, investigators Scott Tipton and James Delehanty. A man was awak- ened by his dog and, after inspecting the home, observed four lights/objects outside, the nearest within 500 yards. Each consisted of a ring of pink- amber twinkling lights and moved slowly at separate elevations until out of sight.

Alerted by her young granddaughter to some- thing unusual outside, a woman con- fronted a disc hovering just above the ground near her farmhouse. Perhaps 20-30 feet in diameter, its shape was later drawn as an inverted toy top and the surface described as \"almost transparent.\" A bright yellow-white light shone at two opposing points along the flat bottom. As the woman approached to within 30 feet, a door- way opened, revealing a human-like being of average height, with blond hair, fair skin, and blue eyes, dressed in a silver coverall. At a window next to the door was a \"bigfoot\" creature, seemingly seated and visible from the chest up. For the next few minutes, the woman stared at the two, gaining the impression that the \"human\" was attempting (unsuccessfully) to com- municate. Then, the vehicle and be- ings vanished instantly (i.e. without ac- celerating beyond viewing range). [Note: The woman is employed as a psychic and claims to have had periodic encounters with UFOs and \"bigfoot\" creatures throughout her life.] • Log #900318: 11/4/89, 1 p.m. event in Pensacola, Florida, in- vestigators Carol and Rex Salisberry. A couple was driving across a bridge when they noticed a dull grey, unlighted disc (in the shape of in- verted pie tins) hovering about a mile's distance over the bay. The rotating object was thought to be approx- imately 20 feet from top to bottom, with a diameter likened to the length of a commercial blimp. At one point during the 2-3 minute observation, it began wobbling and darting short distances while proceeding generally toward the shore. Fishermen and others in the area did not appear to notice the anomaly. When across the bridge, the husband departed the car but did not spot the source again. • Log #900319: 1/12/90, 8:35 p.m. event in Gulf Breeze, Florida, in- vestigators Carol and Rex Salisberry. Six adolescents were climbing trees and playing when they spotted half a mile or so away a dull metallic disc, perhaps 20 feet in diameter, with peaked upper and lower domes. A steady red light was centered at the top, a steady bluish light at the bot- tom. Around the middle were rec- tangular lighted windows plus a few white lights which rotated rapidly around the circumference. The youths began walking toward the object, gaining the impression that it receded and halted in unison with their movements. The object was eventual- ly lost beyond a treeline in the distance. Duration of the sighting was variously estimated from,2-5 minutes.

While cross- ing a bridge, two women noticed a brilliant white, elliptical light above and ahead of them. Reaching the far side, they~ followed the source down a residential street. The object was described as basically elliptical, 10 feet or so in diameter, with red lights on one end. It moved in a seemingly er- ratic pattern over the treetops over the roadway, then was lost from view. They drove to a shoreline park and spotted it again over the water. The women continued to watch its movements until the presence of another auto with male passengers prompted them to leave. Total dura- tion was estimated to be 25 minutes. • Log #900323: 8/14/89, 9:20 p.m. event in Gulf Breeze, Florida, in- vestigator Arthur Hufford. A couple was taking a walk near their home when they noticed a disc of con- siderable size in the indeterminate distance. A brilliant, steady white light shone at the top, while the flat bot- tom was encircled by alternating red and green (or blue) lights which flashed sequentially. The object was \"bobbing\" up and down and moved left and right repeatedly. After 3-4 minutes, they ran back home to get their auto in order to drive closer. However, upon their return there was nothing in sight. • Log #900324: 1/8/90, 6:30 p.m. event in Gulf Breeze, Florida, in- vestigator Vicki Lyons. Ed and Fran- cis Walters were taking an evening walk when they noticed a red glow hovering high overhead. They ran back home and, after placing brief calls to local MUFON investigators and other interested parties, Ed returned to the area with a camera. Within minutes, four other adults and one teen arrived on the scene. Several photos were taken with two cameras. The object was described as a dark disc or oval with \"boiling\" red light(s) centered underneath, surrounded by smaller whitish lights. After a few more minutes all lights were ex- tinguished, and moments later nothing was visible. The photos were thereafter submitted for analysis. • Log #900325: Approximate 7/15/88, 10:45 p.m. event in Gulf Breeze, Florida, investigator Boots Eckert. Two teenage girls were outside identifying constellations when a dull greyish disc appeared from behind a cloud, moved back behind the cloud, then descended in a zigzag pattern within 500 feet of the witnesses. The object was described as about 10 feet in diameter and six feet high, with a row of square or rectangular unlighted windows around the middle. Running back to the house, they turned and saw a blue beam emanating from the underside. After finding a pair of binoculars, they returned but found nothing. Duration was estimated as less than a minute. [Note: One of the witnesses related that, later in the summer, she experienced a bedroom intrusion.] • Log #900327: 2/5/90, 6:30p.m. event in Pensacola, Florida, in- vestigators Carol and Rex Salisberry. A mother and daughter were outside their home when they saw a pulsating red light moving erratically in the distance. Half an hour later, the hus- band was about to get in his car when he noticed a disc perhaps 1,000 feet overhead. He called to the others, who joined him in time to see it receding. The object was 20 feet or less in diameter, with a deep red pulsating light on the bottom and two white steady lights at the top. It moved at a gradual speed beyond trees and out of sight. Duration of the second observation was 20 seconds or less.

MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 264 April 1990"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"18 HISTORICAL NOTES: THOMAS MANTELL By William E. Jones January 7, 1948 is one of those landmark dates in the annals of ufology that will forever be a part of each new comprehensive history of the subject. On that date Captain Thomas Mantell was leading a flight of Air National Guard F-51 fighter planes near Godman Air Force base at Fort Knox, Kentucky. Having been alerted to the presence of an uniden- tified object in the sky overhead, the Godman flight controllers radioed Mantell's flight and requested that they investigate the object which could easily be seen from the base. One plane was low on fuel and it landed, but the others went up to observe from a closer viewpoint. As they closed in, the object appeared to speed away and climb higher. Since the planes had no oxygen on board, which would permit high altitude fly- ing, they had to break off their pursuit. Captain Mantell, however, ap- parently excited by the prospect of closing in on this stranger in_the sky, continued to climb. Reports of the event indicate that he described the events as follows: \"The thing looks metallic and it's tremendous in size.\" As Mantell flew higher, he was ap- parently overcome by a lack of suf- ficient oxygen, lost consciousness, and his plane went into a dive and crashed. Mantell was killed. Conjecture The details of this event have been minutely described in numerous ar- ticles and books elsewhere. Conjec- ture on what really happened has been circulating ever since. Did Cap- tain Mantell, an experienced fighter pilot, confuse the planet Venus for a large metallic object, as the govern- ment's Project Sign concluded he did? Was the object really a large Skyhook balloon, something at least implied by the object's conelike shape? Did Mantell die as a result of oxygen star- vation, or was he killed either acciden- tally or on purpose by conscious design? The answers to these and other related questions are unknown, at least to the general public, and are likely to remain so. What we do know, however,, at least as far as the news- paper reading public is concerned, is that this was the first time someone was killed pursuing a \"flying saucer.\" History was made. As history, however, there is a related story much less well known. The only other reference to it I have been able to find was in an article by Donald E. Keyhoe, \"The Flying Saucers Are Real,\" which appeared in the October 1949 issue of True Magazine. Albert R. \"Jack\" Pickering was a civilian air controller at Lockbourne Air Force Base, south of Columbus, Ohio, that January day in 1948. He was working in the direction-finding station off of the north-south runway about one mile from the control tower. Jack had been an air traffic controller with the military for four years before taking this civilian job. He had a two-year associate degree in engineering and a pilot's license with an instrument rating. He was familiar with military and civilian aircraft. It was approximately ten minutes after 7 p.m. when Jack had an ex- perience that he would never forget. It was dark. The sky was completely overcast with a ceiling of 1200 feet. There was a 10 mph southwest wind and the night was not particularly cold, as Jack remembers. There was no snow on the ground. Pickering was inside the station shack, lying on his back on a cot look- ing out the window. The air traffic that evening had not been heavy, and he was listening to a local AM radio sta- tion. The volume was turned down low, so that he would not miss any calls from inbound aircraft on his air traffic radio. There were no lights on in the shack except for those on the radio dial. Suddenly, Pickering saw something come down through the overcast near or right over the runway. He was looking up at a 30-degree angle. Pickering described what he saw as follows: \"Down through the overcast came this great big round red object.\" For a second or two he thought it was an aircraft falling in flames; it was red- orange in color. Then he realized that this was not what he was seeing. Interloper Jack jumped off the cot and grabbed for the telephone to call the tower. He didn't have time. The tower called him first, wanting to know what was over his station. The telephone had a long cord, so he stepped out the door to get a better look at this strange interloper. The object appeared to be a perfect sphere. It made no sound. It didn't change color. It had no windows, wings, fins or an exhaust. (Later, Air Force investigators asked him specifically about whether an exhaust tube and/or \"a rocket tail\" was visi- ble.) It appeared to be completely smooth. Given the known height of the cloud ceiling, the object appeared to Pickering to be \"bigger than a one car garage, but not as big as my two car garage.\" The object came down through the overcast and stopped. It stayed in this location for approximately four to five minutes. It moved around slightly, never quite holding its position for long. The amount of movement didn't seem to cover more than 100 square feet. During this time Jack MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 264 April 1990"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"19 tried without success to contact any incoming aircraft. Suddenly the object made a com- plete circle of the entire base. It re- turned to a bit southwest of where it started and stopped \"like it had run into a wall.\" Given the size of the base, Jack estimated later that the object had to have accelerated to a speed in excess of 1000 miles per hour. The object remained at this point for a short time, then drifted near the edge of the base, a little past the end of the runway. It descended vertical- ly to the ground, where it remained for ten to fifteen seconds, then rose vertically to just under the overcast. Curiously, no light seemed to be cast on the bottom of the clouds. For three or four minutes it remained in this location. By now Pickering had con- tacted an aircraft coming in from Wright Field to the west. The aircraft, which was several miles out, probably over West Jefferson, Ohio, reported that nothing could be seen. Before the aircraft got any closer, the object went back up into the overcast toward the northwest and disappeared. Later, Jack went out to the area where the object had descended, but found nothing on the ground that ap- peared to have been caused by its touchdown. There were at least four witnesses to this event: Pickering, an Air Force captain in charge at the tower, and two other civilian employees. Over the next two weeks or so, the three civilians were flown to Wright Field on three separate occasions where they were questioned separately by at least five Air Force officers. Jack does not remember their names. A report was prepared of his interrogation, which he signed. He believes it was classified. He was told not to talk about the sighting, which he did not do for many years afterwards. This was not the only UFO related event of the day, however. Earlier, Jack had heard most of the Mantell- related radio conversations as they oc- curred. He does not know how this was done or why. It was unusual to have tower conversations relayed in this manner, but it may have been done because it was so unusual. The conversations may have been taped. MantelPs reports were heard up until the crash, along with related transmissions from Kentucky for almost an hour afterwards. He thinks Mantell said at one point, \"I am clos- ing in. It's gigantic and metallic.\" The ' word \"gigantic\" may have been \"monstrous,\" but he didn't think so. My own interview with Jack was in 1977, so he was remembering back over 29 years. The Mantell case has receded into history. A lot of changes have come to the UFO scene since then, making what was an exciting event at the time seem tame by comparison. In many ways, however, we are no closer to solving the UFO mystery now than we were in 1948. This footnote to the Mantell case was Jack Pickering's con- tribution to our history. Like Thomas Mantell, Pickering is no longer with us.

Suddenly, the aircraft began to shake violently from a shock wave. Both pilots tightened their grip on the con- trols and raised their heads in time to see a \"huge machine\" streak past about 2000 feet away. Powers said to the press after landing: \"It was an enormous apparatus of aerodynamic form similar to an immense turtle and I have no doubt that this machine was guided.\" • UFOs buzzed the headquarters of Air Force Intelligence at Dayton, Ohio, on the fourth. At first they were just brilliant points of light in the dark sky, but then they took on an increased glow and attracted the attention of some people driving home at 5 a.m. The witnesses watched as two lights, one behind the other, entered the at- mosphere at an incredible speed, then suddenly stopped in mid-air directly over Dayton. Then they moved to a point directly over Wright Patterson Air Force Base, stopped, then went into a high speed vertical climb and were out of sight in a couple of seconds. Later, two more lights ap- peared over Dayton, and maneu- vered over the area until dawn. • The following report was sub- mitted by First Officer Robert Man- ning, Trans-World Airlines Co-Pilot: \"I sat at the controls of an airliner 2000 feet over Indiana about 6:20 p.m. on the 27th and watched an ob- ject so shapeless it was disconcerting, overtake our plane and cruise alongside, only half a mile away. I've heard of UFOs, too, so I watched it several minutes before I said a word. I wanted to be sure it was really there — and it really was. It glowed a dull red, like the gas stack of a refinery. But it moved right along with us at 185 miles an hour, creeping up from our right rear until it was about a half a mile away, off our right wing. Only then did I ask my pilot, Capt. Robert Adickes, if he saw anything. He no- ticed it, too. We rang for our stewardess, Miss Gloria Henshaw, and she saw it. She went back and asked the passengers, and they saw it. \"It was definitely an object, it kept right up with us. And most important of all, we could see that it was mov- ing in relation to lights on the ground. We watched it fly parallel to us for seven or eight minutes. I couldn't tell its shape, but I'd guess it was roughly 50 feet across. Then Adickes said 'Let's get a better look,' and we turned to the right to fly closer. As soon as we did that, the object increased its speed and seemed to turn also, away MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 264 April 1990"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"20 from us. Then it descended and seemed to disappear among the lights of South Bend. When it was all over, Adickes went back to the passengers and asked them what, if anything, they'd seen. Those on the right side of the plane described to him just what we'd watched: an object like nothing any of us had ever seen or heard of before.\" • 1955 Four members of the Ground Observer Crops were on duty at Rockford, Illinois, on the eighth when they spotted an unidentified ob- ject near their post at 9:30 a.m. They immediately reported the object to the Air Defense Filter Center in Chicago. Within a few minutes three Air Force jet fighters were on the scene, and, ac- cording to the three GOC members (all business men from the Rockford area) the jets fired on the mysterious- object, causing it to explode. Before the explosion, however, the three GOC members said that a smaller round object shot out of the side of the \"parent\" device, then passed the jets, in horizontal flight, turned on edge, and went into a high speed ver- tical climb, disappearing from view. A few seconds prior, the sound of jet fighters had been heard by John C. Gregory, executive secretary of the Winnebago County Civil Defense Council. Hurrying to the top of the City Hall building, he saw the jets con- verge on their target, as did dozens of other witnesses: Air Force person- nel moved in quickly and warned the GOC members to say nothing about the incident. At the Rockford Register, a quick call was made to O'Hare Field at Park Ridge. The editor was told that the pilots had fired on a weather balloon which had been launched from Minneapolis. There was no mention of the object that streaked past the fighters, nor was there any explanation for the amazing attack on a weather balloon over a populated area. On July 28th, Air Force spokesman, Captain Robert C. White, said: \"... We know of no instance where a military aircraft has fired on any unidentified object. Our aircraft do not fire on balloons, nor would they fire on any target in a residential area unless we were invaded by an enemy force.\" • 1965 A nine-year-old rural New London, Minnesota, boy said he saw a UFO about 5 p.m. on the 26th. At the same time, his father heard an eerie noise that the youth said was caused by the object. Gary Green said he saw a black machine descend noiselessly to within a few inches of the ground, then raise a \"stick\" resembling an antenna or periscope. The noise then ensued. His father described the sound as somewhat similar to a siren, but different. It was even at first, then changed pitch in a slow, warbling manner. Gary said that after a minute or two, the protrusion was retracted and the noise ceased. ..Then the craft lifted slowly to the height of a barn. Then \"zoom, it was gone.\" The disc was about 200 feet away, and looked like two table saucers placed rim to rim and about five feet in diameter. • George Hall watched in amaze- ment as a spherical-shaped craft landed NW of Westfield, Penn- sylvania, about 2 a.m. on the 29th. The glowing~-sprTere then elevated an antenna-like projectile covered with flashing red lights. Seconds later the periscope device lowered and the craft disappeared over a nearby hill. Hall said the sphere was six or seven feet in diameter. • 1975 From 1:45 a.m. until sunrise on the third, law enforcement officers in five counties in SE North Carolina pursued a V-shaped craft with two spotlights. First spotted by Lumberton police, the vehicle was traveling 200-300 feet above the ground, heading north along 1-95. Nearby St. Pauls' officers were contacted to be on the lookout for the craft. Two St. Pauls' officers headed south on U.S. 301 in their squad car to meet the mysterious vehicle. They sported it about 10 miles north of Lumberton as it appeared to take off from open ground at 1:50 a.m. \"We first saw this bright light behind the trees. The light went off in a few seconds, then the craft came towards us,\" officer McPherson said. The vehicle darted about, making right angle turns and accelerating rapidly. \"It was a brilliant, silent moving vehicle.\" Reports from Hoke County fol- lowed the sighting by St. Pauls' of- ficers. The time was shortly after 2 a.m. Officers in Hoke described the craft as a V-shaped, lighted vehicle. From Hoke the vehicle traveled into Cumberland County, then into Sampson County where it was spot- ted by Patrolman Jim Driver and John Hayes. Driver said the craft passed over him about 100 feet above the ground, without sound. Hayes, in another section of the city, reported seeing the vehicle about 200 feet from the ground and said it was some 40 to 50 feet in length, and was bathed in a blue tint. About 5:50 a.m. the craft was sighted in Elizabethtown in Bladen County. Citizens said the vehi- cle's \"searchlights\" bathed the town in light. Approximately 100 sightings were recorded on the night of the third. No fewer than nine law enforcement of- ficers reported seeing eight craft similar to the V-shaped vehicles reported earlier. Newton Grove Police Officer John Hayes spotted a V- shaped craft moving at low altitude. As it passed over some pecan trees he could hear a slight humming sound. It appeared to have a wingspan of about 50 feet and had an effect on his police radio. White Lake Police Chief Gary Moore had an extended confrontation with a brilliantly lit vehicle about 8:45 p.m. Moore said he was driving about 50 mph when the craft \"came down\" and \"the whole side of the road lit up like it was daylight. I went on about 300 yards, stopped my patrol car, got out, looked in the air and the light was so bright I had to look away. I got a set of binoculars out of the car and I looked up at it. Then I got an airplane landing light that I carry in my patrol car and I shined it up there. I blinked the light at it, and it blinked back. MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 264 April 1990"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"21 Moore added that after the vehicle blinked, it \"went straight up and out\" at about 200 miles per hour. Moore described the craft as V-shaped. It lit up an area of about 500 feet on either side of the road and made no sound. Asked how he felt during the time of observation, Moore said, \"I couldn't say anything for a second or two. I said if they want me, they're going to come and get me, but they didn't seem to want me.\" • Witnesses continued to flood law enforcement agencies with their sighting reports on the fourth and fifth. In an apparent desperate at- tempt to discredit the reports, United Press International — in a nationally distributed story — quoted an un- named official federal source as say- ing an \"experimental, delta-wing\" air- craft was responsible for the sightings of the V-shaped craft. The story was immediately followed by a statement from the Federal Aviation Administra- tion that no test flights were being made in the sighting areas at the time the UFOs were spotted. The knockout blow to the UPI story came when Bill Cline, an intelligence officer from Seymour Johnson Air Force Base arrived on the scene in Lumberton. He said all the reports of things seen in North Carolina definite- ly indicate something unusual. Asked point blank whether he thought we were dealing with something manufactured on this planet he said, \"No, I do not.\" Letter to the Editor... Dear Editor, I've been interested to read the ar- ticles and letters in response to my paper on UFO abductions that ap- peared in the May issue of your jour- nal. I appreciated having the feedback I received — even when it was critical — and found some commentaries (e.g., John White's) very constructive indeed. Nevertheless, I had no intentions to try to respond, especially to my critics, because I felt that I had already been given enough space to have my say and had no interest to engage in pro- bably fruitless debate. I have been forced to change my mind, however, because of the commentaries of some of the abductees who have written to your journal to express their anger with me. I will not claim that what I will say next will be sufficient to assuage their anger, but I do feel that some of them at least have failed to understand what I went to some pains not merely to state but to emphasize in my original article. In my opinion — and I hope in theirs — had they understood me correctly, they would not have had reason to accuse me of the \"crimes\" with which I seem to have been charged. I may turn out to be wrong in my views, but nothing I said de- means the experiences of abductees or is meant to minimize the suffering they have endured. Forgive me a few quotes from myself — but they serve to show how much distortion my perspective has already been subjected to. First, as to the reality of these experiences which I am held to deny: \"Whatever 'UFO abductions' may be, they represent a subjectively real experience ... to those who undergo them ... It is no good to dismiss all this as attention- getting fantasy.\" In my article, when I discussed the imaginal realm, I stressed the events it addresses are perfectly real: \"The most important attribute of the imaginal realm ... is that it is ontologically real.\" I don't know how many readers assumed — despite my clear statement to the contrary — that imaginal is not to be equated with imaginary. Indeed, I would invite you to repeat that state- ment ten times so as to stamp it in! Just because I am not persuaded that abductions are engineered by ex- traterrestrial beings doesn't mean I don't think these experiences are real. Of course they are real — but what reality is, is not the straightforward issue that many people may suppose. If it were, we would have consensus, not controversy, over how to interpret abduction episodes. Second, some abductees seem to think I am unaware of or unsym- pathetic to their suffering. Let me again first rebut this misconception by a cou- ple of quotes: \"UFO abductions (are) deeply upsetting to the persons who undergo them. The phenomenon cries out for our respectful, if perplexed, attention — as the individuals who have been subjected to these ex- periences cry out for our help, com- passion and understanding.\" \"UFO abductions are not funny and those whose lives are dislocated by them don't deserve to be laughed at.\" I've talked to and heard from enough abductees to know that for many of them their experiences have been a source of deep trauma; I have nothing but respect for those, such as Budd Hopkins, who have addressed themselves to their needs. I regret any misunderstandings or bruised feelings that my words may have caused any abductee, who have already suffered enough, but at the same time I must categorically deny that, though I may be proved to be wrong about the source and nature of their experiences, I am unsympathetic to what they have had — and continue — to endure. Like them, I, too, am trying to under- stand this experience and it heartens me to know that at least some ab- ductees who have written to me think that, after all, I \"may be on the right track.\" It would take another article to reply to all the objections that various writers have raised about my interpretation of abductions; but the ones brought up by the abductees themselves whose comments were published were, I felt, the most important to be addressed. I hope that my remarks here have served to reassure them on some troubling points while at the same time clarifying my own position regarding the reality I accord to the experiences which have so profoundly affected their lives. - Kenneth Ring, Ph.D. Storrs, CT MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 264 April 1990"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"22 The Night Sky Walter N.

Moon Phases: First quarter — May 1 Full moon — May 9 c o Last quarter — May 17 New moon — May 24 First quarter — May 31 The Stars: The Big Dipper, high in the north, is centrally located in the late evening sky and serves as a handy built-in pointer system for finding many springtime constellations. First of all, a line through the two stars (Dubhe and Merak) on the end of the bowl carries you to a spot near Polaris the North Star, which is the end of the Little Dipper's handle. The stellar pair (Megrez and Phad) on the other side of the bowl points in the opposite direction to Regulus, the heart of Leo the Lion. The Big Dipper's handle traces a curve southward to the bright orange star, Arcturus, in Bootes the Herdsman. And another curved line extended an equal distance from Arcturus farther south takes you to blue-white Spica in Virgo the Maiden. As we catch our last glimpse of the winter stars in the west — Procyon, Pollux and Castor, and Capella — that sky symbol of summer, the Sum- mer Triangle (Vega, Deneb, Altair), has begun to appear above the NE horizon.

Western Regional Director Election The term of Paul C. Cerny, the present Western Regional Director on the MUFON Board of Directors, will soon expire according to corporate bylaws. Filling this important position for the western states is a wonderful opportunity for a person with leader- ship abilities, dedication to resolving the UFO phenomenon, and time resources. Experience as a State or State Section Director are valuable at- tributes, however enthusiasm and available time are also certainly signifi- cant assets in successfully fulfilling this prestigious position. Since it is strict- ly a volunteer position, anyone in- terested in being considered should write to Walt Andrus to express their interest and desire. An election will be conducted by ballot by the members in the western states of WA, OR, CA, ID, NV, UT, AZ, MT, WY, CO, NM, AK and HI: The candidates must also reside in one of these states.

Advance planning is required in order to reserve space in these facilities and to construct the exhibits and displays. Marge Christensen, Director of Public Education, heartily endorses this pro- gram in order to take advantage of the resurging interest in UFOs. MUFON Award The Annual MUFON Award plaque for the most outstanding contribution to Ufology in 1989-1990 will be presented at the MUFON 1990 Inter- national UFO Symposium in Pen- sacola, Florida on July 7, 1990.
