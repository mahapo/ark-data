Maybe it was the prospect of arriving in Roswell late at night only to find every room in the city and for 100 miles around already sold out. But for whatever reason, the expected crowds failed to materialize for Roswells UFO Encounter 97, the citywide celebration of the 50th anniversary of the Roswell Incident. Deon Crosby, director of the International UFO Museum and Research Center and one of the festivals organizers, was predicting 10,000 visitors a day for the six-day course of the celebration, which would more than double Roswell's population of 50,000.1 doubt if half that many showed up in the broiling heat. My first suspicion that many summer vacationers might have opted for cooler climes came when I checked into the Roswell Inn at about 5:30 p.m.. Wednesday, July 2nd, and the clerk asked me if I wanted a smoking or non-smoking room. Clearly not every room in town was booked up after all. Which isn't to say there weren't crowds, mind, just nothing on the order of the madhouse that had been an- ticipated. To be sure, a galaxy of UFO heavy-hitters was on hand, along with a swollen press corps and con- (Left) The International UFO Museum and Research Center on Roswell's Main Street.

Dean, Stanton Friedman, John Mack, Lance Strong Eagle Crawford, Paul Davids, Whitley Strieber, John Hunter Gray (the former John Salter), Donald Schmitt, Linda Moulton Howe, and Budd Hopkins. Philip Corso was also on hand, granting interviews and signing books. In addition. John Price of the UFO Enigma Museum presented his own line up of speakers which included Kevin Randle and Karl Pflock. At last count, the official press office in the Convention Center had handed out passes to some 300 reporters from 15 coun- tries. At some speeches the media seemed to outnum- ber the paying customers. The most conspicuous hole in the program was a rock festival which had earlier been touted as Woodstock in the Desert. Promoters had speculated about a crowd of 150.000. But that was before Hale- Bopp, Heaven's Gate and 39 suicides. Reportedly, a few major sensitive sponsors pulled out in the wake of the negative image surrounding the UFO subject, leaving the promoter high and dry. Which may have been a good thing. With merciless sunshine most of the time and temperatures routinely hitting 100,1 doubt if the local hospitals could have handled all the heatstroke and sunburn cases that would almost surely have resulted. Except for Corso's presence and one major press conference, to be addressed later, there wasn't much in the way of new news at any of the major speeches. The latest and most controversial Air Force report on Roswell was out, and while it was obligatorily and derogatorily sneered at on occasion, few had had the opportunity or time to thoroughly study it and address the specifics of same.

To begin with, there was a bewildering array of alien \"artifacts\" for sale everywhere, the least of which were large numbers of UFO books and videos. There were ALF (alien life form) bolo ties, pens, earrings, pendants, post- cards, posters — you name it, even ALF commemo- rative coins, cookies and underwear. Hardly a shop front on Main Street wasn't gussied up in its alien finest for the event. As befitted a circus celebration, there was also plenty of family activities, from a costume contest and laser games, to outdoor music and the 1997 UFO Crash & Burn Extravaganza, a parade of homemade \"space- ships.'' If you had your own car you could drive down to the south side of town, into the Roswell Industrial Air Park, formerly Roswell Army Air Field, and peek at Hangar 84, where wreckage and alien bodies were allegedly stored for transport to Wright Field in Ohio, except, of course, for the stuff that had to be shipped by truck through Fort Riley, Kansas, so that Colonel Corso could see it while stationed there in 1947. Crash Sites . Even without a car you could still visit the Hub Corn crash site some 20 miles north of town out Highway 285. Roswell ISO buses left hourly from the Convention Center for the approximately two-hour, $15 per person round trip into the blazing desert and back. This is the site unearthed by Roswell researchers Kevin Randle and Donald Schmitt and attributed to one of their star witnesses, Frank Kaufmann. It was here, six to seven miles off the main highway, according to Kaufmann, that a black, heel-shaped object slammed into a low bluff at a 35-degree angle, disgorging five bodies, one of which was still alive when he and a mili- tary contingent arrived. For the really dedicated Roswell enthusiast, there are at least three other claimed crash sites relatively nearby, although none is as near or as easily accessible to Roswell as Kaufmann's. Another Randle/Schmitt witness, the late Jim Ragsdale, identified two places before his death, the first on public property, the second on private. The grandaddy of all Roswell crash sites, however, is the former Foster ranch, near Corona, some 75 miles NW of Roswell.

Gen. Arthur Trudeau, by saying \"we didn't leave any paper trail\" and we seeded the patents to American industry. At one point he also claims that \"we used the de- bunkers.\" To a question relayed through his ear piece which we can't hear, Corso responds, \"How does he know. He wasn't there. Where's his documentation? I was there.\" Of course critics of the book have been asking Corso the same thing: Where's his documentation for any of his claims? Karl Pflock, author of Roswell in Perspective, is also present, expecting a debate with Corso. But appar- ently there has been a misunderstanding.

Demi Sims of Houston. \"Press Conference\" Inside the press packet reporters received was the following startling announcement made by the Los Angeles PR firm of Abrams-Rubaloff & Lawrence: SCIENTIFIC PROOF TO BE PRESENTED THAT AN EXTRATERRESTRIAL CRAFT WAS RECOVERED NEAR ROSWELL. NM Given that, if true, this would represent the most momentous event in human history, the press release seems worth quoting in its entirety. \"ROSWELL, NM (June 30, 1997) - A press confer- ence scheduled for 9 a.m. July 4, 1997. at the Pearson Auditorium on the New Mexico Military Institute Campus in Roswell, New Mexico, will present the re- sults of scientific tests performed on crash debris found near Roswell, New Mexico, fifty years ago that once and for all prove that the downed vehicle was not of earth origin. [Emphasis in the original.] \"A research scientist from a major university in- volved in the testing will be on hand to discuss the methodology and results of the isotopic ratio tests of the Roswell debris. Supporting conclusions and a bat- tery of tests conducted by universities and national lab- oratories will be provided that conclude that the Roswell debris is manufactured material of extraterres- trial origin. [Emphasis in the original.] \"The discovery that crash debris has been pri- vately held in civilian hands was made by television producer Chris Wyatt, former Producer of Day & August 1997 Number 352 Page 8"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL Date. Mr. Wyatt uncovered the material while pro- ducing the upcoming television special, UFO's [sic] Above & Beyond. \"This could be the greatest discov- ery of our time,\" notes Wyatt. \"Paul Davids, Executive Producer of the Showtime film, 'Roswell,' is sponsoring the presen- tation of this evidence during his program at [sic] 50th Anniversary. Along with images of the actual . Roswell crash debris, the chain of evidence will also be presented validating the Roswell incident as the recovery of a crashed extraterrestrial vehicle.\" Reality Whoever wrote this stuff was more showman than straightforward. As reality unfolded, hardly a sen- tence of the press release reflected the actual events. First, the reporters clogging the Pearson Auditorium lobby were told that the press conference would fol- low David's presentation. As it turned out, however, there never was a press conference at anytime, if by press conference you mean that members of the press get to address questions to those making the extraor- dinary claims for which the conference was called in the first place. Davids did provide background, first summarizing the so-called \"known\" events surrounding the Ros- well Incident, then introducing the claims of \"con- clusive scientific evidence\" associated with an al- leged piece of \"debris,\" and finally introducing one of the scientists who made the findings. Joining Davids on stage were Jesse Marcel, Jr., who handled the Roswell debris at age 11, Derrel Sims, a self-described Houston hypnoanesthesiolo- gist who made sure that reporters spelled his name right, Roger K. Leir, a podiatrist, producer Wyatt, and Russell VernonClark, introduced as a chemist from the University of California, San Diego, spe- cializing in environmental health and safety. Sims and Leir are founders of F.I.R.S.T.—Fund for Interactive Research and Space Technology—and both have been active in the recovery and study of alleged implants. (See the April 1996 issue of the MUFON UFO Journal, \"In Search of Hard Evidence\" by Roger K. Leir, pp. 9-12, 15.) Sims said he was handed the piece of debris— about an inch and a quarter wide—in October of 1995 while at a west coast conference by an individ- ual who wishes to remain \"secret out of fear of ridicule and reprisal.\" Findings The youngish-looking VernonClark appeared ner- vous, saying \"I've lectured to larger audiences before, but never to so many cameras.\" Paul Davids, left. \\\\'ith Russell VernonClark. Roswell fragment in background. VernonClark (yes, that's how the name's spelled) an- alyzed trace samples of nickel, silver and zinc from the largely silicon-based sample using ICP/MS—Induction Coupled Plasma Mass Spectroscopy. All of the sam- ple's isotopic ratios were significantly different than their terrestrial counterparts. Earthly silver, for example, is composed of two iso- topes, silver 107 and 109 in roughly a one to one ratio, 51 to 49 percent, respectively. The \"debris\" sample, however, had a two to one (67 to 33) ratio of silver 107 to silver 109, indicating an off-world origin. Terrestrial silicon is composed of 92 percent silicon 28; the sample ratio showed only a 26 percent silicon 28 ratio. Silicon 29 and 30 were present in the sample at ten times their terrestrial ratios. Some of VernonClark's initial findings were report- edly confirmed using Secondary Ion Mass Spectro- scopy. But the source for this confirmation was referred to only as \"a major west coast university.\" If validated by repeated testing, this would indeed indicate an extraterrestrial origin for the sample. But was it natural or manmade, or rather alienmade, that is, manufactured? Silicon doesn't appear in a pure form in nature, which explains why chip makers go to such drastic measures in the manufacture of silicon wafers. According to VernonClark, the sample was composed of 99.9 percent silicon, indicating that it was indeed manufactured. The source for this evidence, however, was described only as a \"laboratory in Texas.\" Jesse Marcel. Jr. came forward next and said that the sample, which he was first shown at a UFO conference in Japan of last year, \"was somewhat similar\" to what he handled as an 11-year-old boy—the debris his fa- ther, the intelligence officer for the 509th Bomb Group, laid out on the family's kitchen floor after his return from the Foster ranch, where Mac Brazel had first found the stuff. August 1997 Number 352 Page 9"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL But the fragment shown on stage (color pictures of which can be found in Beyond Roswell by Michael Hesemann and Philip Mantle) looked more like a small rock than anything manufactured. Yet in all of the pre- viously published accounts of his recollections, none of the three types of material Marcel described in any way resembled a rock. Most recently, in January of this year, Marcel referred to the only likely candidate—the bakelite-like material—as thin flakes in irregular shapes, perhaps the sort of stuff you might expect if you shattered an old phonograph record. Davids made a few more comments about Roswell in general, referring specifically to Philip Corso's dra- matic rewriting of UFO and terrestrial history, The Day After Roswell. He seemed unaware that the publisher, Simon & Schuster, had withdrawn Senator Strom Thurmond's laudatory Foreward from the book after learning that the latter dealt with UFOs and a govern- ment cover up and not Corso's career in military intel- ligence, as Thurmond said he was originally led to be- lieve. Davids also seemed unaware that Corso origi- nally spoke of a six-fingered alien (apparently based on the alien autopsy film, but changed the number to four before the book went to print), and that he is the only \"witness\"—alive or otherwise—who has ever claimed that the bodies went by a laboriously slow truck con- voy overland from Roswell to Wright Field, instead of being expeditiously flown there by plane. And with that the presentation concluded. Let the press conference begin! A Hostile Press But there was no press conference, just a perspiring Davids cornered in the lobby, fielding reporters' ques- tions. He told one reporter that the sample was \"like having a piece of the Shroud of Turin for analysis. It's what you dream of.\" But Davids also backed down on several points. He admitted that there was no \"chain of evidence\" linking the fragment to Roswell—as had been patently promised in the press release. Only Sims knew the identity of the source, who was said to have been in the military at the time. Meanwhile, on the front steps of the auditorium and in the parking lot, the press was interviewing the press. What happened to the other so-called \"scientists\" on stage? As it turned out, at least two reporters, one from the Arizona Republic, the other from the Fort Worth Star-Telegram, hadn't been lured to the lobby and had followed the scientists out the back door of the audito- rium—where a car with open doors and the engine idling was waiting. The scientists were whisked away. VernonClark reportedly flew out of Roswell the same day. In response to a shouted question about why he wasn't taking questions, VernonClark said that he didn't want to risk damaging his career. Saturday morning Davids held a follow up press conference, sparsely attended by only a handful of re- porters, in which he complained of a \"hostile press.\" In the end, the only \"research scientist\" connected with the press conference, VernonClark, turned out to be not a research scientist at UC, San Diego, but merely a staff member. No names of the other scientists or laboratories supposedly involved in the confirmation of the extraterrestrial sample were given out, nor was any evidence presented—other than Marcel's vague statements—that would tie the Sims rock to 1947 and Roswell. Sunset & Rainbow Friday afternoon there was a reception for the media at the Sally Port Inn across the street from where I was staying. Shortly after, the heat wave broke, if only tem- porarily. As I walked back to my room two partial rain- bows arced behind the big Roswell Inn sign. It was hard to miss the metaphor. Maybe there was a pot of gold somewhere in Roswell. If so, it seemed more likely to be found in the gift shops and souvenir stands than in the speeches and press conferences I'd heard. A little later lightning and a summer thunderstorm raked Roswell, and that seemed eerily appropriate, too. Hadn't it been a similar storm, exactly 50 years to the day, that had allegedly brought the aliens to Earth and the headlines to Roswell in the first place? In my room I hooked up my laptop and began filing my report. I uploaded the digital camera pictures I had taken that day and then turned on the \"telly.\" Pathfinder was down on Mars and the pictures were being beamed back live to a waiting world. (The next day NASA's web site would record more than 100 million hits.) I was aware of the conspiracy theories already swirling around Pathfinder like a Martian sandstorm. That it wasn't really on Mars, that if it was, the pictures would be delayed or discontinued altogether if any- thing unusual turned up. But as I continued watching CNN's live coverage, it looked like the real item to me. Say one thing for NASA: They knew how to land a robot on Mars. And how to hold a press conference in its wake. (Editor's note. Both Paul Davids and Roger Leir have objected to my characterization of the Roswell press conference in an earlier e-mail post. They have been offered space in this Journal to present their point of view.

Wood The Day After Roswell, by Col. Philip J. Corso (Ret.), with William J. Birnes, Pocket Books, $24 C redible people seeing incredible things.\" This quotation from the UFO literature describing many UFO witnesses applies perfectly to Col. Philip J. Corso, a man who in the 1950s, fought for the release of the truth about our prisoners of war and missing in action per- sonnel in Korea, and blew open the con- ceded Government conspiracy to suppress this information. Thus, as a distinguished career officer, his credibility is superb. The incredible is that he is describing — what some of us conjectured but none of us are sure of— the reverse engineering of our present society from a drawer full of parts recovered from the crash of an alien vehicle at Roswell. The book is a fairly chronological sum- mary of how Corso was involved. A deco- rated veteran of the Italian campaign in WW II, he was trying to keep the Com- munists and Nazis from taking over as we occupied Italy. From there, he began a dis- tinguished career in Army Intelligence, and he synthesizes from his career a theme of how the Extraterrestrial Biological Entities (EBEs) influenced his life, the Army, and indeed our society. In July 1947 his first dramatic encounter occurred while he was officer-in-charge of the night watch at Fort Riley, Kansas, when some of the Roswell parts were on their way to Wright Field. He pried open a packing crate, and looked at the face and body of a four-foot alien with four fingers, lying in pale blue fluid.* Corso reveals, with the natural pride of a career Army officer, how Army Intelligence thought they knew special secrets: how the KGB had penetrated the CIA, how our for- eign policy was being dictated by the KGB, and therefore why it was important not to trust much the CIA, or for that matter the Navy or the Air Force. In this setting, his distinguished boss, Gen. Arthur Trudeau, asked him in 1961 to go through parts re- * Elsewhere in the book Corso refers to six-fin- gered aliens. covered from Roswell to see whether we could use this technology to improve the Army's effectiveness. Corso rose to this challenge with a plan to use our normal intelligence operations as cover (such as \"We got this piece from East Germany\"), use trusted Army development labs in their normal functions (such as Fort Belvoir for night vision), and offered the contractors the patent rights (thereby ensur- ing that reverse engineering became a part of recorded reality). For two years, Lt. Col. Corso then initiated a series of reverse engi- neering developments from the parts in the filing cabinet drawer. The eyepieces allegedly recovered from the alien craft turn out to be the source of infrared night vision goggles. The clear, glasslike wires that seemed to bend light turn out to be fiber optic cables. The quar- ter-sized gray wafers inscribed with fine lines turn out to be highly integrated cir- cuits. The stubby device that put a red spot on the wall when you pressed the button (and burned through intervening metal) turns out to be a powerful, compact laser Robert M.

The thin, flexible gray metal that sprang back with no creases turns out to be directionally woven material and becomes the basis of Kevlar bullet-proof vests. The irradiation of food for storage emerges, and high power directed energy weapons, such as space-based satellite killers, are another fallout. But the list goes on. The headbands the aliens wore pick up signals from the brain, and these signals are then used to control the flying craft in real time. This work is actually ongoing today at the Air Force Laboratories at Dayton, and there have been unclassified publicity re- leases. S o what does a knowledgeable ufologist or just an ordinary citizen conclude from this remarkable tale? It is difficult to fault the record of in- tegrity of this distinguished Army officer. It is intuitively apparent that a review of his military records if they were available would be consistent with his reported career facts. Col. Corso will not be found to be phony in any way. A tiny negative note is associated with the glowing foreword by Senator Strom Thurmond, which was re- tracted by his office as having been pre- pared for a book about Corso's life, not about flying saucers and aliens. This press release, labeled \"Right Foreword, Wrong Book\" seems to have merely accelerated the release date from the 4th of July Roswell celebration to mid-June. The essential con- tent of the foreword, that Col. Corso is a great guy, dedicated to serving and protect- ing the United States, shines through irre- spective of the retraction. Criticisms of the book have largely to do with lack of information. The following is a list of things that could have been included but were not: • A Table of Contents to easily find the correct chapter • A bibliography to give a clue to the sources • An index to make it easy to find key items • Detailed references to sources, idea by idea or thought by thought • Some statement, any at all. as to why he decided to write the book now • A mention of the specific role that William J. Birnes played in producing the book (editor, co-author, agent?) • More declassified documents, prefer- ably from Top Secret, to provide the ex- pected links with legitimate classified work • Mention as to whether he had been ap- proached by anyone to be either encouraged to write or discouraged from writing this book • More specific names of living person- nel, contractors, contract numbers for these technologies • A mention of the acknowledged vitally important basis for the sources of energy and the basis for propulsion. He either doesn't know or he is hiding the answer. Which is it? Since Corso mentions that the CIA, Navy, and Air Force all probably had recov- ered parts as well, it would have been nice to speculate on what they might have done with their parts for reverse engineering. Did he get clues? Are they working on this problem still? On the negative side, the three references at the back of his book do not add much, with Twining's (formerly) Secret memo and Unclassified report having been available for many years. It would be interesting to know if Corso had never seen them except through his own records, and felt that they would be new to the public. On the other hand, the 1959 plan of the Army to build a base on the moon, Project Horizon, may be new to some people. I personally had an Army Major tell me in the 1970s that the Army had a plan to put a base on the moon because the Moon is made of dirt, and \"We deal with dirt.\" C olonel Corso touches also on the politi- cal aspects of the war with the aliens. His enthusiasm shows when Reagan gets Star Wars approved, and Corso contends that the weapons that emerged now permit us to begin to deal militarily with the alien threat.

Returning home from work, driving north on Route 3 from Littleton on a moonlit night, the witness was surprised by a \"huge.\" rectangular object crossing high over the road in front of her, from the West. The view was at a low enough angle for her to clearly see the object through the wind- shield. Most obvious were six large, rectan- gular lights, evenly spaced, like \"the win- dow[s] of an aircraft taking off, before the inside lights are turned off, only much big- ger windows.\" She said the lights could have been reflections of the full moon off the windows. At the bottom front of the craft was a very big, green light that steadily glowed. Undaunted by the oddity, she turned off her radio and and opened her window to lis- ten, but heard nothing unordinary. After crossing the road, the object paused for a minute then slowly moved on east- ward, leaving the witness feeling \"peaceful.\" LOG # 970122E, MA-1, 01/22/97. N. Stratford, NH, at 21:45 hours, for I minute. Investigator: Sandra Black This sighting became known by the in- vestigator due to an article on January 29 in the local newspaper. She called the editor to obtain the names of the witnesses, who will be identified as Will, Wit2, and Wit3. ' On the same night as the prior sighting, Will was readying herself for bed when she noticed a red light out the bedroom window. She immediately thought it was her hus- band, Wit2, who uses a red spotlight for wild dog hunting, but then realized Wit2 was in the house. She called to him. Joined by their son, Wit3, the three studied the red- dish-pink light covering the fields and trees around the home. Their eyes finally focused on a large, pink and blue orb about a half a mile away that emanated the glow. Two smaller and white orbs accompanied the first, one on the left and the other on the right. The three blobs merged and shrank, becoming one small, white ball that moved silently northward. They believed they felt heat radiating from the anomaly. Witl was frightened, and Wit2 stopped watching with his wife. Wit3 watched the single light move away, then enlargen and begin pulsing. Soon, it shrank to a pinpoint light and moved away. LOG # 970123bE, MA-1, 01/23/97, Dixville Notch, NH at 16:40 hours, for 8 minutes. Investigator: Michael Leclercq The witness who reported the case is re- lated to the investigator. The object was seen hovering above the trees by a male who was driving home with a work associate, from Dixville Notch, westward on Route 26. They were in an area considered to be a UFO hotspot (and nicknamed \"the Bungy\"). \"What is that!\" he repeated over and over, while slowing his vehicle's passing by the apparent anom- aly. The 30 foot (or larger) tall saucer-shape stood on end (its major axis vertical). At an altitude of 500 feet or more, it was ab- solutely stationary, even though a strong wind was blowing. A dark stripe along its axis made the object appear like a clam shell, except a bright white light shone at its uppermost apex. Sunlight reflected from its silvery surface, and no sound was apparent. Not being able to stop due to road and traffic conditions, the witness drove on past, until the object was no longer visible. LOG # 970123aE, FB-1, 01/23/97, Clarksville, NH, at 21:15 hours, for 3 min- utes. Investigators: Sandra Black and Michael Leclercq The sighting became known to the inves- tigators through a friend of one. Two women were driving north on Route 3 in Clarksville when one of them noticed The view through the windshield allowed her to clearly see the object. Most obvious were six large, rec- tangular lights, evenly spaced like the windows of an airplane.

Curious, the two went up a hill for a better view and passed a stopped truck with a man outside who was also watching the light. An elongated disc with red and white lights around it and a small cloud below was finally discerned from the aspirin-sized vision of the object. Two red lights were ro- tating around the perimeter and behind sta- tionary white lights that appeared on either end. The object and its cloud moved slowly away from their position. LOG # 970128E, MA-1, 01/28/97, Colebrook, NH, at 20:30 hours, for \"a few\" seconds. Investigator: Sandra Black After being ignored by the local newspa- per, a young boy witness found her phone number and called the investigator. Shutting off his light to go to bed, the boy saw a fast moving, large oval object outside which glowed a bright white. He claimed it was like sunlight reflecting off metal, it was so bright and figured at arm's length the visual image had to be the size of a baseball. As the boy watched, the object rose to clear a ridge, and the white light extin- guished. The outline of the object was still seen, however, until it was much farther away. LOG # 970220E, FB-1, 02/20/97, Stewartstown, NH, at 19:00 hours, for 3-4 minutes. Investigator: Sandra Black The witness called the investigator due to a MUFON ad the investigator had placed in the local newspaper. While night snowmobiling in the Diamond Pond area, with her husband well in front of her, the witness noticed a cluster of four or more vertical, rectangular yellow lights a quarter of the way up in the south- ern sky. To the side of the lights, she saw a \"very small\" pulsating red one, and the group was trailed at a short distance by four or five small red lights in a group. She turned off her machine to watch, since the apparition seemed too close to ignore. No solid body was observed, but the light set appeared to be associated with a single anomalous object that, according to the wit- ness, may have been cigar-shaped. She heard a low sound — more like a rumble than another known sound, but not properly described by a rumble — as it crossed her path. The house-size collection of lights came over a ridge, crossed in front of the witness, then went up over the next ridge and out of sight before the witness' husband returned to look for her. CORSO - Continued from Page 12 with the outcome because, he says, we also provided a shield for them. These specula- tions, while credible enough to one inclined to believe them, are not supported by sub- stantiating documents or anything easily checkable. This is the first book dealing with the possibility of the reverse engineering of weapons and technology based on the re- covered parts from alien craft. Many people who believe that the near-fantastic accelera- tion of our technology since WW II is re- markable are prepared to accept the idea that we may have had some \"help.\" While this book is not the proof that this is what happened, it provides the clues to check, one-by-one, on the history of these develop- ments. I predict this book will wind its way into the list of the very important books on UFOs in the next few years. No U. S. History or UFO library should be without it, since it is the first to describe a very believ- able reverse engineering process for alien parts.

Apart from the 30+ pages of color photographs and art, there are countless seldom seen b&w pic- tures, along with numerous drawings and documents. Subtitled \"The Alien Autopsy Film, Area 51, & the U.S. Government Coverup of UFOs,\" Beyond Roswell is mon- umental in scope and production. Unfortunately, much of it also quite un- believable. The two authors seem to have never met a UFO story they didn't whole- heartedly accept. Before the reader leaves New Mexico for Nevada, the landscape is literally littered with new crashes and dead bodies are beginning to pile up at Wright- Patterson like so much stacked firewood. Consider this bit of new information (p. 224) that the authors turn up in the person of one Robert Morning Sky, half-Hopi, half- Apache: \"What surprises me and other Indians in the reservations is that the major- ity of UFO crashes—as far as I know there were sixteen crashes between 1945 and 1950 in the U.S.A.—that fourteen out of sixteen crashes occurred on or near reserva- tions and that no UFO researcher noticed this fact and started his researches with us. Indians prefer to sleep under the open sky rather than in a house.\" Even a non-European might be forgiven for asking at this point why, if Indians like to sleep outdoors all the time so much, they bothered to build teepees and pueblos like Casa Grande. This sort of blind acceptance of everything said by anybody—from Indians (Morning Sky) to Cavalry (Col. Corso)—is precisely what's wrong with ufology today. No one even asks for proof anymore, let alone demands it. See, for ex- ample, Alien Agenda by Jim Marrs. This also raises a whole new issue in ufology—poltical correctness toward Native Americans who claim some sort of insider's knowledge of UFOs and alien entities based on \"Star Elders\" and other ancient myths and traditions. Without blinking an eye, Morning Sky adds that \"the first [crash that summer: there were three] happened at Socorro. That was the crash from which the being in the autopsy film came and not from Roswell.\" How does Morning Sky know this, as the autopsy film itself remains under a seriously dark cloud of suspicion? Well, as it turns out, apparently Morning Sky's grandfather and others of his tribe res- cued a Star Elder from one of the crashes, who then lived with them for five years be- fore returning to his own people. Morning Sky presumably tells the authors this bit of earthshaking news with a straight face. which they then pass along to the reader with a similar, nonplussed countenance. How their \"investigation\" proceeds from there is best exemplified by the following remarks from page 227: \"'What did he say about his own people, his religion?' we asked. Obviously we had touched a delicate theme with that crunch query.\" Alas, such \"crunch\" queries permeate the book. Earlier the authors state their own confidence in their new found source (p. 225) by noting that \"he was willing to take us to witnesses who would confirm his tale, however fantastic it might sound.\" But two pages before that we're told that while \"he claims to have spoken to these witnesses, [they] refuse to come out in the open, into August 1997 Number 352 Page 15"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"MUFON.UFO JOURNAL Why would a race of ad- vanced space- farers have the odd habit of embossing structural I- beams with re- ligious graffiti, as opposed, say, to the ET equivalent of \"Made in Shanghai\"? August 1997 Number 352 Page 16 the world of the 'paleface.' They are afraid, afraid of the Government, afraid of the Army, afraid of the soldiers, whose brutality they have seen with their own eyes.\" Perhaps the palefaces in Roswell ought to consider shutting down the two public UFO museums there, before Army troops do it for them, as they tell many of the same stories in plain view. At least they were the week I was there recently, and I didn't see anyone shaking in their boots or moccasins. Counting dollars, yes, trembling in fear, no. Or perhaps the Indians should simply con- sider setting up their own crash/recovery museums on the reservation, as a form of self-protection, if nothing else. In either event, it's a pity that people give credence to this sort of stuff, but then it's always po- litically correct to bash the military and government, isn't it? The same sort of uncritical latitude is shown the Bob Lazar story and the so-called alien, or Santilli, autopsy film. In regard to the latter, the authors say (p. 206) that \"Bob Shell, editor of Shutterbug magazine, con- firmed the age of the Santilli footage,\" when he has done nothing of the sort. All Santilli has offered researchers for the last two or three years is a runaround—and that has been confirmed on numerous occasions. The authors could have used this one to call on to Santilli to end the confusion and make samples available for conclusive testing. Instead, they plaster stills from the film all over the place, even when Santilli has yet to demonstrate that the exposed film stock it- self actually exists. To the best of my knowledge, all anyone has seen is videotape of what is purported to be an original film. The few frames of film Santilli has made available for analysis cannot be conclu- sively tied to the original autopsy \"film\" it- self. Eventually, this laissez faire approach culminates in the book's silliest chapter— devoted to \"translations\" of the I-beam's so- called proto-Phoenician \"alphabet\" by both Morning Sky and Hesemann. The usual cos- mic themes, \"pathways,\" \"gods,\" \"keepers,\" that sort of thing, are referred to willy-nilly, without much in the way of evidence except for some references to ancient writing and symbols and so-called \"experts\" like Erich von Daniken. But why would it be thought for more than a minute that a race of ad- vanced spacefarers would be given to em- bossing structural I-beams with religious graffiti as opposed, say, to the extraterres- trial equivalent of \"Made in Shanghai\"? This is the same sort of mumbo-jumbo that resulted in all of the \"translations\" of the crop circles' \"script\"—each one different, of course. But then this field is full of mysteries and contradictions. For example, the authors make no attempt to address the issue of why the \"new\" crash at Socorro should also in- volve I-beams with inscriptions—as at Roswell—but different aliens than the ones allegedly recovered at Roswell. Maybe someone should get back to Mr. Morning Sky and ask him why six-fingered aliens crashed at Socorro and four-fingered ones at Roswell. Maybe he could even fill us in about any five-fingered aliens while he's at it. Buy it for the pictures, and because you collect all this stuff anyway. But believe it only if you think all Indians like to sleep outdoors, come summer, rain and snow.

BROAD New York Times In the darkest days of the Cold War, the military lied to the American public about the true nature of many unidentified flying objects in an effort to hide its growing fleet of spy planes, a CIA study says. The deceptions were made in the 1950s and '60s amid a wave of UFO sightings that alarmed the public and parts of official Washington. The CIA study says the Air Force knew that most reports by citizens and aviation ex- perts were based on fleeting glimpses of U-2 and SR-71 spy planes, which fly extremely high. Those planes were developed in the 1950s and '60s to photograph enemy targets. From secret bases, mainly in California and Nevada, the aircraft repeatedly flew across the country and eventually overseas to bases in countries that included Britain, West Germany and Taiwan. While commercial airliners in the 1950s flew at altitudes of up to 30,000 feet, the U-2 soared to more than 60,000 feet and the SR- 71 to more than 80,000 feet, or 15 miles, nearly the edge of space. The planes carried powerful cameras to spy on foreign military installations and sen- sitive electronic gear to capture radio and radar transmission. The spy craft were de- veloped by the CIA and often flown by the Air Force. Rather than acknowledging the existence of the top-secret flights or saying nothing about them publicly, the Air Force decided to put out false cover stories, the CIA study Continued on Page 20 It's not easy to summarize a half century of UFOs in less than 300 pages.

Especially forprint- ing it as the cover story for June. It does not matter whether readers agree or disgree with Mr. Jeffrey. It is only important that he have a forum to express his point of view. Because you are willing to air different sides of an issue, I applaud you. I am proud to be a member of MUFON and a sub- scriber to your publication. —Harold Burt Dana Point, CA Kent Jeffrey's article, \"Roswell— Anatomy of a Myth,\" presented the public with a great service by making us all think more seriously about such important cases as the Roswell Incident. His arguments were very convincing since so much bally- hoo has resulted from the long-term inves- tigation and some lies were intentionally fabricated. However, my own mind is cautious con- cerning Roswell. Things come to mind such as: Why did Mac Brazel suddenly get a new pickup truck? Why was the rancher picked up by the military and, according to Sheriff Wilcox and others, detained for sev- eral days'? Why did Jeffrey and others ig- nore the fact that the story indicates the ob- ject simply struck the ground and appar- ently bounced back up into the air to crash elsewhere? Such a contact would be most unlikely to leave behind instruments or other clues of a high technology. Why would the few scraps that Jesse Marcel picked up take large boxes to pack and why, if it happened, was security so great? Actually, whether Roswell happened or not can be irrelevant to the UFO mystery. Even if it never happened that does not eliminate the thousands of good people who have seen UFOs, who carry similar scars on their bodies, who have seen the burnt circles in backyards and fields after a peculiar night's happenings, and the many photographs of UFOs which have held up to the scrutiny of scientific analysis. My point is, that we should not worry too much over whether Roswell is fact or fic- tion. The UFO phenomenon is very real and at least many of the objects are solid, intelli- gently guided, and they are not ours. —Richard D. Seifried Norman, OK Regarding the Roswell study by Kent Jeffrey, I think it would have been better presented in a series of 2 or 3 segments. That choice would have provided space for other articles supporting the view that the debris belonged to an alien spacecraft. Continued on Page 20 Have some- thing you want to get off your chest?

UFO SPY PLANES - Continued from Page 17 says. For instance, unusual observations that were ac- tually spy flights were attributed to atmospheric phe- nomena like ice crystals and temperature inversions. \"Over half of all UFO reports from the late 1950s through the 1960s were accounted for by manned re- connaissance flights\" over the United States, the CIA study says. \"This led the Air Force to make misleading and deceptive statements to the public in order to allay public fears and to protect an extraordinarily sensitive national security project.\" Associate Editor's Note: This is another example of the progress that the UFO community has made in its efforts to get the government \"to come clean.\" They have shot themselves in the foot again. FORUM - Continued from Page 19 Also, it would have avoided the awkward and com- plete dominance of an entire issue by an anti-UFO ar- ticle published in a UFO periodical. It makes little difference, however, because a new book will con- vince nearly everyone that Jeffrey missed the mark. Most highly recommended to MUFON members is The Day After Roswell by Lt. Col. Phillip Corso (Ret.) from Pocket Books. He was the focal point in the U.S. Army for evaluating artifacts from the crash that were seeded into the development of many high-tech items in common usage, such as, lasers, computers, etc. This work was so secret it was shielded from the Air Force. Corso also shows that the Strategic Defense Initiative (Star Wars) was intended more as a defense against alien invasion of Earth than against Soviet missiles. The one thing never deciphered from Roswell was the electromagnetic propulsion system that did not re- quire any fuel to be carried. Solving those problems for our own travel in deep space has become the cen- terpiece of a new, major program of NASA. Naturally, I have some interest in it and hope to participate. U.S. citizens and everyone else on the planet owe a great debt to the bold revelations by Corso. Jeffrey should buy a copy of his book and advise MUFON members in a future article if his view of Roswell is altered. —Jim McCampbell Belmont, CA"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL WORLD'S LARGEST UFO WEBSITE http://www.ufomind.com/ufo Over 10,000 documents!

Our bright planetary neighbor is near the crescent Moon on September 4 and 5. Mars (1.1), in Libra, is low and difficult in the SW at twi- light, setting about 9 PM in mid-September. Jupiter (-2.7). retrograding in Capricornus, lies in the SE at dusk, moving westward across the southern sky thereafter. Saturn (0-3), in Pisces, rises in the E about 8PM in mid- month and crosses the southern sky during the night. Bright Planets (Morning): During the latter half of September, Mercury can be seen at its best morning appearance of the year. Look carefully for a tiny orange dot low in the E at dawn. Binoculars help. Jupiter sets in the WSW about 3 AM in mid-September. Saturn advances to high in the SW at dawn. The big gaseous world stands close to the gibbous Moon on the 18th. Surveyor and Prospector Orbit Mars and Moon: As Mars Pathfinder continues its surface mission on the red planet, Mars Global Surveyor arrives this month and takes up its station in orbit. The probe is designed to study surface com- position and height of features, polar ice caps, and gravity and magnetic fields. Eventually it will also begin photomapping the globe. In addition to Mars, our own Moon will be explored this month or next from a 60-mile-high polar orbit. Lunar Prospector will map our satellite's geologic composition and fields and seek to confirm last year's possible find of water ice at the lunar pole. Moon Phases: New Moon—September 1 \" First quarter—September 9 Full moon—September 16 Last quarter—September 23 o Part of the prominent Summer Triangle group, two mytho- logical birds, Cygnus the Swan and Aquila the Eagle, fly in opposite directions along the Milky Way. Between them lie three small, usually ignored constellations—Vulpecula the Fox, Sagitta the Arrow, and Delphinus the Dolphin. Most obscure of the trio, Vulpecula perhaps is best known for the so-called Dumbbell Nebula. This sphere of gas, like its more famous neighbor in Lyra, the Ring Nebula, was blown away from a dying star at its center. In amateur telescopes it does indeed resemble a dumbbell rather than a sphere. Sagitta and Delphinus are better likenesses of their namesakes. Sagitta has sometimes been connected with Cupid and some- times with Sagittarius the Archer. If the little arrow comes from the archer's bow, however, it is traveling in the wrong direction!

The Board authorized a sub-com- mittee John Schuessler (chairman), Walter Andrus, Dr. Robert M. Wood, and Dennis Stacy to define and implement changes to the Journal that would bring it more in line with the wishes of the membership. This could include seeking a new editor. A survey form for readers will be developed and included with a future issue of the Journal. Twenty-eight years ago the MUFON UFO Journal was the voice of ufology, but with all of the added competition, both printed and the electronic media, it no longer holds that distinguished position. Full color UFO magazines with over one-half advertising were shown as examples of the competition. The Board of Directors fully comprehend the desires of the mem- bership and will start making evolutionary changes, not revolutionary, to improve the Journal. NEW OFFICERS Sandra G. Black, B.A. (West Stewartstown, NH) has volunteered to be the temporary State Director for Vermont. She is a state section director in New Hampshire and works in Vermont. Ross L. Fox, Tennessee State Director, selected Steven J. Purcell to be his Assistant State Director. Eleven new state section directors assumed their duties this month. They were Laura L. Miller (Catonsville, MD) for Baltimore County; Kenneth L. Bergeron (Fayetteville, AR) for Crawford, Franklin and Sebastian Counties; Eugene M. Walker, Ed.S. (Adrian, GA) for Johnson, Emanuel and Treutlen Counties; William A. Lester, Jr., B.S. (Jonesboro, GA) for Clayton, Henry and Newton Counties; Jerold H. Seiple (Northampton, PA) for Northampton and Lehigh Counties; Lawrence F. Gessner (Velva. ND) for McHenry, McLean, Pierce and Sheridan Counties; Deanna F. Collins, B.S. (Durango, CO) for LaPlata and Montezuma Counties; Gary L. Dillman (Waldorf, MD) for Charles, St. Marys and Calvert Counties; Lucy J. Daugherty (Primm Springs, TN) for Williamson and Hickman Counties; Nancy J. Ceroni-Vest (Highland, NY) for Ulster, Dutchess and Orange Counties; and Marvin P. Maxsom (Teague, TX) for Freestone and Limestone Counties. NEW CONSULTANTS AND RESEARCH SPECIALISTS Donald R. Burleson, Ph.D. (Roswell, NM) volun- teered to become a consultant in English Literature. Four new Research Specialists joined MUFON during the past month: Jed E. Turnbull, M.A. (Brooklyn, NY) in Social Work; Michelle M. Dziuba, M.A. (Newark, CA) in Clinical Counseling; Haskel Straus, M.S. (Salem, NH) in Computer Science; and Noel A. McClean, M.S. (Arnold, CA) in Engineering Mechanics. TEXAS HIGHWAYS MAGAZINE In the August 1997 edition of Texas Highways maga- zine, six pages were devoted to UFOs and MUFON's UFO Information Center and Museum in Seguin, Texas. The article is uniquely titled \"Lone Star Sightings Fill The TeX Files,\" authored by Nancy L. Cotton, with photography by J. Griffis Smith, and one full page illustration by Tom Curry; all in glorious color. David Spencer (Austin) and Walter Andrus are featured, along with the abduction plaque pro- duced by Robert Turner (Santa Fe, NM), and the lighted UFO model built by Paul Cerny (San Jose, CA). A quarter of one page is a photograph of the alien plaque made by Robert Taylor (Ft. Wayne, IN) stand- ing in front of the state capital building in Austin, Texas, and illuminated in green on one side and ma- genta color on the opposite. Another one-fourth page has a map showing the Center's location in Seguin and what visitors can expect to see. We couldn't possi- bly aford an advertisement of this caliber—it is ter- rific. Since subscribers to this popular magazine started receiving their copies on July 21, we have had a steady flow of visitors from all corners of the state of Texas to MUFON's UFO Information Center. New Journal subscriptions are being received daily, since all of the details appear in what is literally a news ad- vertisement, courtesy of Texas Highways —The Travel Magazine of Texas. ASSOCIATE MEMBERS AUXILIARY The Director of MUFON's Associate Members Auxiliary, Thomas J. Lyon, has announced the fol- lowing officer appointments: Lynda D. Poss, Assistant Director; new State Associate Directors Keith J. Allen for California; Christopher W. Pittman for Massachusetts; Trenton Simshauser for Oregon; and Larry Clow for New Hampshire.

Continued on Page 20 August 1997 Number 352 Page 23"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL DIRECTORS MESSAGE, Walter Andr us NEWS FROM AROUND THE NETWORK ROSWELL AND KENT JEFFREY The Roswell investigation by Kent Jeffrey, published in the June 1997 MUFON UFO Journal, is his opin- ion based upon his personal investigation over a two- year span. Even though fifteen pages were devoted to Kent's explanation, this in no way is the philosophical or editorial view on Roswell of either the Mutual UFO Network or the staff of the MUFON UFO Journal. Some readers were disturbed by Mr. Jeffrey's \"closed\" attitude on Roswell even though his evidence was far from conclusive to support his viewpoints. May I quote from the masthead (page 2) of the MUFON UFO Journal? \"The contents of the MUFON UFO Journal are determined by the editors and do not necessarily reflect the official position of the Mutual UFO Network. Opinions expressed are solely those of the individual authors.\" The editor also included a by- line on page 3 that stated \"In an article sure to gener- ate significant controversy. Kent Jeffrey explains his own change of heart.\" Before condemning the editors of the Journal, these two significant statements should be taken into consideration. Everyone has their own pet theory on what actually happened at Roswell during the first week of July 1947. however, a theory doesn't become fact until the evidence supports this theory. For readers to accept Kent Jeffrey's investigation to be the official stance of MUFON and our monthly magazine is entirely unwar- ranted. We have published the opinions of Roswell in- vestigators such as Stanton Friedman, Bill Moore. Don Berliner, Kevin Randle, Don Schmidt, Karl Pflock, Kal Korff, Jamie Shandera, Philip J. Corso, Michael Hesseman, and others in the Journal. Definite contradictions exist between each of these authors in what really happened in Roswell. It all depends upon whom each of them took testimony from and inter- viewed, including censoring of their inputs to reflect the personal theory or opinion of the individual au- thor. Without a doubt Kent Jeffrey's viewpoint is just as valid as the previously cited authors in this respect, so why should we deny him this forum? Even more controversial is the question, if there was indeed a partially destroyed craft that crashed near Roswell and that bodies were recovered, where is the actual crash site? Again, who do you believe, be- cause numerous authors mentioned each have their August 1997 Number 352 Page 24 o  0 , . o own favorite site. Your Director is utterly confused as to where he should pay his $15 to see the \"real crash site.\" To add to the confusion. Col. Philip J. Corso, U.S.A. (retired) in his recent book titled The Day After Roswell would like for us to believe his complete ex- posure of not only Roswell but his personal participa- tion in the UFO phenomenon technology. His army and public service credentials appear to be impecca- ble, so why did he write this expose'? If he is lying, it could destroy his hard-earned credibility. (Even his grandchildren watched their beloved grandfather auto- graph his books in Roswell.) Is his book an approved government attempt to leak the Roswell facts to the public, such as astronauts Edgar D. Mitchell and Gordon Cooper have been doing? The USAF press conference at the Pentagon on June 24. 1997. was a farce and a mockery perpetuated upon the public, when they attempted to explain the recovery of four bodies in July 1947, by proposing that they were six-foot tall dummies weighing 200 pounds each used in balloon/parachute experiments in the 1950s. Of course, the big question is, if nothing happened in Roswell in July 1947, why did the U.S. Air Force issue their Project Mogul balloon explana- tion report in September 1994 and follow it with The Roswell Report—Case Closed in June 1997? If this sounds more like an editorial than a message from your International Director you are right on tar- get. STATE DIRECTORS VOICE OPINIONS ABOUT JOURNAL At the annual State/Provincial Director's meeting in Grand Rapids, Michigan, on July II, 1997, a number of concerns were expressed about the contents of the MUFON UFO Journal that were taken to the Board of Director's meeting on July 13th. The Kent Jeffrey arti- cle infuriated the membership in general, since it was too long, full of apparent errors in reasoning, and de- bunking in nature. Members want to hear about UFO sighting reports, not arguments between writers. It was proposed that a survey of Journa\\ readers be con- ducted as part of giving the Journal a face lift. For the second year the number of subscribers/ members decreased, which definitely demands an im- mediate evaluation. The Board of Directors heard the serious concerns of the State Directors loud and clear Continued on Page 23"}]
