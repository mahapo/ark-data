The year 1966 was an especially active year for UFOs, both in sighting frequency as well as national press coverage. 1966 was the year of the in- famous “Swamp Gas” sightings in Michigan and also the Portage Ohio UFO chase. Both of these cases are of special interest to me as they highlight the human drama that unfolds when a con- cerned citizenry witnesses an anoma- lous event only to have the authorities tell them it was a misperception of the mundane. In Michigan it was Dr. Hynek himself who declared that a group of coeds were just witnessing a belching biomass from the swampy areas around their college. In the case of Portage, Ohio, it was Project Blue Book person- nel who tried to convince more than one law enforcement officer that they were chasing a planet and a satellite at high speeds across two state lines. It is no wonder that UFO witnesses are reluctant to come forward because of the real possibility of public ridicule. So what happens when a planet/ satellite leaves physical evidence and this evidence has been preserved in an unbroken chain of custody for 40 years? You will want to read this month’s cover story to find out.

It is published in the MUFON 38th Annual International UFO Symposium Proceedings. Abstract As an archaeologist I am skeptical about UFOs being from other civilizations outside of our own atmosphere. To be sure, people for thousands of years have seen unexplainable things in the night sky. Various books and T.V. shows which purport to show that our ancient ancestors painted or carved likenesses of ‘space visitors’ invariably do not understand the material culture of these peoples, or their myths. However as a former deputy from Portage County, Ohio, this case was fascinating and important to me. After studying these data, I am still skeptical about visitors from outer space, but much less skeptical about the government’s capacity to do whatever it takes—including ruining the lives of public servants—to silence questions about just what is being seen by thousands of people each year. Background—1966 In the early morning hours of April 17th, 1966, Deputies Dale Spaur and William (Barney) Neff were on patrol in southern Portage County, Ohio, when they responded to an accident. A car had hit a utility pole and the wires were down. The driver had been taken to Robinson Memorial Hospital in Ravenna, and the electric company repair crew was on scene re-setting a new pole. They asked the deputies to get them some coffee, so Spaur and Neff drove east to the Deerfield circle, to the Circle restaurant which was (and is) a popular greasy spoon. They spoke briefly with the waitress and cook, got the coffee and were returning west to SR 44 where the accident had occurred, when they passed a car on the side of the road. It was parked on the east-bound side of SR 224, and had not been there when they had driven by on the way to Deerfield. They turned their patrol car (P-13) around and pulled in behind the vehicle. Things immediately got a little strange. The car had several antennae on it, and what looked like radio gear inside. Dale noticed an insignia on the door, which looked like an “oblong diamond, with strange symbols and lightning bolts on it.” As Spaur approached the vehicle on the driver’s side, Neff approached and stood near the passenger side rear corner of the vehicle. As Dale reached the driver’s door, he looked behind him to be sure that “no one was sneaking up on us.” That is when he noticed the bright object rising above the trees on the side of the road. What happened next has been written about extensively (at least some of it). In brief, deputies Spaur and Neff proceeded to chase the object for 86 miles, across four counties and two states. It was widely reported that two other police officers also saw and chased the object; the truth is actually a little different. When the chase ended, they were supposedly contacted by an Air Force official while still in Pennsylvania, and they also reported seeing jets that the Air Force scrambled to intercept the object. Later the Air Force denied either allegation. Project Blue Book was involved early on. Major Hector Quintanilla himself drove to Ravenna, Ohio, on May 10th to interview witnesses. The official conclusion: They were chasing the planet Venus. Evidence box discovered in 1985 In the 1980s I was a deputy sheriff for the Portage County Sheriff’s Office, and had never heard of this case. I was only three years old when it happened, and not being among those who believed in such things, I had never read about this significant UFO case. In 1985 I was tasked to help clear out old files to prepare for some major renovations occurring at the County Courthouse where the Sheriff’s Office was housed. All cold files pertaining to violent crimes (such as murder, rape, missing persons, etc) were to be kept; the rest of the material (if it was over 15 years old) was to be tossed into the trash bin. It was while cleaning out the old Detective Bureau storage area that I came across an old evidence box with extensive reports and interviews, as well as some physical evidence (still sealed in bags), marked “Spaur / Neff Chase, 04/66.” I began to look through it to determine whether it was a violent crime. It appeared to only be some sort of chase until I spotted the word “UFO.” I asked if this was a cold case that should be kept, and was told no; nobody knew anything about it, so it was to be thrown out with the rest of the trash. However, as it seemed like a large case file and had evidence bags, I decided to keep the material, thinking it may make for some interesting reading. The file and evidence bags went into my attic until 1998, when I discovered it again while packing to move; when we got into our new house I decided to finally read it. When I had gone through most of the material, in 2006, I emailed MUFON—which I Michael M. Nelson"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"November 2007 4 MUFON UFO Journal Continued on page 6 The Portage, Ohio UFO Chase Continued from page 3 found on a Google search—and described what I had. I received a reply from James Carrion, International MUFON Director, and that is how I can to be involved in this Symposium. The Documents The file contained the usual material: an incident report by deputies Spaur and Neff, voluntary statements from witnesses, scene photos, reel-to-reel tapes of interviews, the DB report and follow-up reports, memos and newspaper clippings. What caught my eye was a memo from Sheriff Ross Dustman to Detective Smith dated April 18, 1966. In the memo, Sheriff Dustman instructs the detective that the Sheriff’s investigation was to be kept strictly confidential—it was not to be disclosed to either the Air Force or the NICAP investigators that an independent investigation was being conducted. This was irregular, to say the least. Letters from Congressman Gerald R. Ford in the file showed that evidently he was aware of the case and was interested in learning more. This eventually led me to the Gerald R. Ford Library and Museum in Grand Rapids, Michigan, where I discovered literally boxes of files on this case, as well as several other files on other cases involving law enforcement at all levels, military personnel and government employees. There were also quite revealing witness statements by civilians. Betty Raymond, the night waitress at the Circle Restaurant in Deerfield, had spoken with the deputies when they came in for coffee. She relates that the deputies came in about 4:30 a.m. She reports, “About half an hour later I was taking a break out front when I noticed a very bright light in the sky, coming from the west and heading east along SR 224. At first it looked round, but as it got closer it looked more like one of those blimps that they keep in Suffield, only going very fast and making no sound.” This is significant for several reasons. First, she watched the object come from the west and pass to the east in a matter of minutes—hardly what one would expect Venus to do. Secondly, she watched it approach and describes it as first looking like a “bright light” and as it got closer like a Goodyear blimp (the main hangers for the Goodyear blimps were in Suffield Ohio, just a few miles west from Deerfield and along SR 224). So this object was not a point source. Betty continues, “Like I said, it looked as large as a blimp, but was going too fast and besides, it did not make any noise at all. I yelled for Chuck to come out—he is the cook but we had no customers at that time—and he came out and saw it too. By now it was getting pretty close, and I started getting a little scared. I crouched down behind my new car, and tried to see what it was doing. Chuck stood there a while longer and said he could see a police car coming and that they must be chasing this light. This thing, this light, went straight over the circle, and it was so bright it looked like daylight. It also made my skin feel very hot, and all of my hairs stood up, like static electricity. That was when Chuck jumped behind my car too. He was yelling that it felt like his skin and eyes were burning. A few moments after it passed, the police car, the Sheriff’s car went around the circle going very fast. They were obviously following this thing. I then looked at Chuck to see if he was all right, and his eyes and nose seemed red, like a sunburn. But the rest of him looked very pale, and he went inside to sit and have some coffee. I looked at my car to see if it had been damaged or the paint burned, but it was okay. If [sic] was not until later that morning that I found out that the ignition cap and wires were all burnt and it would not start.” This is a very important statement because it demonstrates physical effects of some sort of energy on Chuck, and on Betty’s car. I will conclude this look at witness statements with the last part of Betty’s interview. Detective : Is there anything else you would like to add? Betty : No, that is the story. The Air Force guys came by about 7 a.m. and took our names and addresses and asked us what we saw. I thought it strange that they got here so fast, even before you got here. They were not in uniforms, and their car seemed too beat up for a government car, and it had funny marks on the doors that did not look like Air Force symbols to me. So we gave them our names and told them we had really only seen some strange lights in the sky. Detective : What did the marks look like? Betty : Well, it looked like an elongated diamond, with some symbols and what looked like lightning bolts on it. It also had some letters, but they did not spell anything, or at least no words that I understand. There were lots of antennas on it too, like a police car, only more. These guys wore dark suits, but they were not Air Force uniforms; my brother is in the Air Force and I know what they look like. They told us not to ever speak about this, as it was a matter of national defense, and there could be dire consequences if we spoke with anybody about this. They even told Chuck not to go to the hospital or see his doctor about those burns. They told him they would heal with time. They also told me my car must have had defective wiring in it, and that is what I should tell anyone who asked me about what happened to it. They were very intimidating."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"      5 MUFON UFO Journal November 2007 Brick—Unburned side Brick—Burned area, closeup Brick—Burned side. Right side is blackened.

There is also an interview with a Lt. Colonel from the Youngstown Airbase, in which the officer describes himself as the base UFO officer, and wherein he confirms to the detective that 2 USAF F-102 jets were scrambled to intercept and identify the object being chased by the deputies. Later, in both the Air Force report and the NICAP reports, this is completely denied. There are over 200 pages of such documents and interview transcripts in the case file. All of them will be included in the book. The Interviews Many UFO investigators have attempted to contact the two main deputies involved in this case. Notably, Jeff Renner of the Cleveland Free Times had spoken with Wilbur Neff on a few occasions, but Mr. Neff eventually stopped talking with anyone. Both men moved and went into hiding. After hiring a private investigation firm to find them, I approached them with a great deal of caution. Wilbur Neff, who now resides in Florida, agreed to speak with me because I was a former Deputy from the same department, and he understood I was not a UFO investigator. Basically his recollection of the event was vivid and largely the same as related in the report. He did not get close enough to the car on SR 224 to see any markings, but said that Dale (Deputy Spaur) had mentioned them. He also remembered how Major Quintanilla really did not seem as interested in the truth as finding a reasonable explanation for the event. Mr. Neff states, “when he told us it was Venus we were chasing, Sheriff Dustman became quite upset. I asked how Venus could appear wider than an interstate highway, and his reply was it could not. I asked him if he had ever considered that it might be some sort of experimental airplane or something from the Russians, and he said no—it was not the Russians, and it was not an aircraft—it was Venus.” In addition, his wife remembers that morning when William got home. “He looked like he had just been through hell. He was nervous, agitated, and angry. He kept saying that the Air Force would rather ruin his reputation then search for the truth. I don’t know what he saw, but we frequently see Venus and it has never looked like it was 50 feet across and moving around the sky.” Dale Spaur was harder to find. He had lived in a Cleveland suburb for a while after his divorce, and he ran a taxi company in West Virginia for a while. When I found him he was in a Hospice in Iowa. He reluctantly agreed to speak with me, and the entire content of the two interviews will be in the book. I asked if this chase was either a hoax or Venus. “No man in his right mind would make something up that was untrue and that he knew would ruin his life. I lost my wife, my friends, my job and my reputation just by telling the truth. And what we saw sure as hell was not Venus. It was as big as a house, and as bright as one of those arc welders they use now-a-days. It took off, rose about 100 feet in the air, moved from the south to the north side of the road, then back right over it. It blocked out most of the sky and Venus, behind it.” I asked him about the reports of him telling a reporter that the car had markings that said ‘seven steps to hell’ on the door. He replied, “The car did have funny marking on it. Like a square turned to sit on one corner. And there were squiggly lines that looked like lightning, and some other letters and symbols. I told the reporter I had a funny feeling in my stomach, like I was descending steps into hell—I guess that is where he got it from.” We spoke for over two hours each on two occasions, and I still believe that he was completely honest with me. Mr. Spaur passed away in 2006, but he seemed genuinely pleased that someone was working to clear the reputations of all of the officers involved in the chase. The Physical Evidence First, I must state upfront that I am only mentioning two-thirds of the physical evidence in this presentation [MUFON Symposium presentation, Denver, August 2007]. Some of it is still being processed, and I am not comfortable speculating on possible outcomes. Secondly, due to time constraints I can only address briefly the evidence for which I have received complete analysis, and so will just gloss over them here. Again, if you want the complete lab reports (some of which are very technical, especially the nuclear lab results) please contact me and I will tell you when the book will be printed. But this paper includes a good overview of what evidence was collected. Photographs were taken by the detective at the first- contact scene, when the object was first spotted rising by the deputies. There was reportedly a circular area of burnt grass and underbrush, and a nearby surface coal seam and an old brick foundation of some building. None of the photographs turned out clear—all appear fuzzy and fogged. I have a photo expert attempting to digitize them and see if they can be cleaned up. Detective Smith used a Civil Defense Survey Meter to look for any radiation. He reported ‘high readings’ in the area around the site, and the highest being inside the outer edge of the circle, but not at the center."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"      7 MUFON UFO Journal November 2007 Infrared Analysis: The infrared spectrum of the control coal is typical, showing the well-known components known to comprise it. These are a “macromolecular network composed of groups of polynuclear aromatic rings, to which are attached subordinate rings connected by oxygen, sulfur, and aliphatic bridges.” 1 Included in the organics is a mix of minerals such as clays, illite, kaolinite etc., as well as carbonates such as siderite, calcite and aragonite. 2 Footnotes 1 R. A. Friedel, “Spectrometry of Fuels”, Planum Press, New York, 1970; Richard J. Lewis Sr., “Hawley’s Condensed Chemical Dictio- The Portage, Ohio UFO Chase By contrast, the spectrum of the “contact coal” (below) is different from the above spectrum. It shows the sample is totally inorganic. Light scattering in the higher frequencies suggest carbonization. Broad unresolved absorption between 1100 -1000 cm -1 , 800 cm -1 and 470 cm -1 indicates some silicate material. The silicate mineral appears to be primarily a quartz-type (SiO 2 ) or polymorph. There is no kaolinite (a clay type mineral). No organic materials are present. Infrared Spectrum of the Control Coal Infrared Spectrum of the “Contact Coal” nary,” Fourteenth Edition, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York, 2001. 2 “Coal”, Wikipedia on line, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coal"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"November 2007 8 MUFON UFO Journal The Portage, Ohio UFO Chase Continued from page 6 There was a seam of coal on the surface, which runs for over 300 feet, and passes through the area of the circle. It can still be found today. Coal samples were taken from an area 16 feet from the circle, and from 100 feet away. The far sample was essentially normal. The near sample resulted in the following conclusions paraphrased from the Frontier Analysis, Ltd lab report: “The ‘contact coal’ sample has been exposed to intense heat in excess of 2678° F. This sample is completely porous, indicating a volatilization effect. This was supported by the lack of any organics in the sample as observed by infrared analysis, an ashing experiment and specific gravity measurement.” See coal spectrums on page 8. A brick was taken from the old foundation at 38 feet from the circle, and resulted in the following conclusions by the lab: “The brick was exposed to intense heat in excess of 2678 °F. Normal brick is fired between 1598°F and 2012°F, depending on the type of raw materials. A subsequent exposure to very intense heat is proven by the unusual presents of high temperature tridymite, glass and high temperature cristobalite only in the blackened material, which also contains the original minerals in the brick. These materials are polymorphs from the normal brick materials that form above 2678°F.” See the brick photos on page 6. These results are indicative of very high heat exposure. In addition, the farmer stated that the circle of dead grass, the burnt coal and brick were not present on April 14th, and that no storms or lightning strikes, nor brush fires had occurred between the 14th and the 17th when the samples were taken. Checking weather archives verifies this to be true. This rules our lightning as the source of energy for these affects. Conclusions It is quite apparent from the physical evidence, the testimony and the documents that what was chased in the early morning hours of April 17th, 1966, was certainly not Venus. There is just too much collaboration of the facts to deny that some object was chased and/or seen by nine law enforcement officers; and that whatever it was caused physical damage to objects—and in one case a person—who were exposed to the ‘cone of light.’ What is disturbing is the fact that one country Sheriff’s detective easily discovered all of this evidence, and neither the U.S. Air Force nor NICAP disclosed that they had also found this information. This is simply hard to believe. I do not feel that this case has changed my skepticism toward UFOs being of intelligent extraterrestrial origins; however it does change my attitude about how the government handled these cases which were not obvious hoaxes, misidentifications or just natural phenomenon. Obviously what was observed and chased was not Venus or a known type of aircraft. And just as obvious is the government’s role in discrediting several citizens, many of whom were public servants just doing their jobs. This case certainly needs to be re-investigated by modern ufologists in light of the new evidence. Michael Nelson, MA., RPA Michael M. Nelson, MA, RPA, was born and raised in Portage County, Ohio.

I am not speaking of the highly laudable hard work of organized efforts like the Disclosure Project or Exopoli- tics movement, but stressing that a little help from the MUFON man or woman on the street during the Presidential campaign season might just go a long way to aid the cause. When I heard that Republican Presidential contender, former Massa- chusetts Governer Mitt Romney, would be visiting a local diner during my work lunch hour to shake hands and ask for votes, I was there. It was late morning of October 10 th when I entered Jimi’s Restaurant in Royal Oak, Michigan, a suburb of Detroit. A greeter at the door asked if I’d wear a sticker in support of the candidate. Although uncommitted to any candidate at the moment, I duly applied the sticker as I saw this as a way to make me more approachable, especially since I was sporting a notably casual appearance that day. I Ask Romney About UFO Coverups Minutes after I received my meal, Governor Romney bounded in and started to make his rounds, table by table. When he got to me, he asked how my meatloaf was; I told him it was fine and asked to have my picture taken with him. After the picture, I said, “If there is one issue that interests me that I haven’t yet heard addressed yet by any of the candidates, it’s this: If elected, I would hope that you would consider lessening any possible govern- ment cover-up of what it knows about UFOs.” All things considered, he handled it pretty well, wincing only very slightly and saying, “Sounds like a good idea. I agree. I’d like to know, too,” before briskly moving on to the next table. His tone was warm and polite, but, I just didn’t get a sense of passion that he would tackle this issue in his first hundred days in office. The local ABC affiliate filmed our exchange and an AP reporter asked me to comment on what I’d just said to Romney, but nothing came of it. This was the day of the Chrysler UAW strike and, in the Detroit area, that story owned the TV news that day. Also no story by the AP reporter materialized. Oh, well. Giulliani Was Asked a Similar Question Fast forward a few days to Sun- day, October 14, at a town hall style campaign stop by another Republican Presidential candidate, former New York City Mayor Rudy Giulliani in Exeter, New Hampshire. A young boy asked Giuliani, “If we find that there’s something living on another planet and it’s bad and it comes over here, what would you do?” After the laughter died down, Giuliani mentioned briefly that no one had asked him that question before. Grinning, he replied to the boy, “How do we get prepared for an outer space attack? Well, if we’re properly prepared for all the different things that can happen to us, we’ll be prepared for that, as well. Right? We’ll be prepared for anything that happens.” He com- mented that the boy might be the next Steven Spielberg and asked him if he wanted to be a science fiction writer or a scientist. The boy replied he wanted to be a sculptor and Giuliani moved on, saying, “Shall we take one question about this planet?” With his playfully dismissive tone, it rather begs the question of whether Giuliani, New York City Mayor from 1993 to 2001, is aware of high-profile UFO events in his own city. For example, in 1989, the U.N. Secretary General at that time, Javier Perez Cuellar, is said to have witnessed an abduction event in Manhattan, along with several other witnesses (as detailed Romney and Giuliani Asked About UFOs as they Campaign Continued on page 10 Mitt Romney and Bill Konkolesky at Jimi’s Restaurant in Royal Oak, MI. by Bill Konkolesky"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"November 2007 10 MUFON UFO Journal A MUFON member in New York is looking for others to participate in a project to monitor and record air-traffic communications. Jeff Hahn of New York City, a member and field investigator, is currently working on a project to build an independent archive of air-traffic communications by monitoring and recording those communications using aviation-band scanners, open-source software applications and inexpensive, older personal computers. The purpose of the project is to use the archive to provide confirmation of transcripts and recordings provided by aviation authorities in the event of a sighting that may affect air travel, for example, the 2006 O’Hare incident and the Phoenix Lights incident of 1997. The goal is to create an ongoing archive of aviation communications. Jeff has rigged up a Linux computer to record the output from a scanner listening to the tower communications at nearby LaGuardia Airport. The computer records for 18 hours a day for a week, then copies the files to a DVD, and starts again. “I think it might be useful in case the FAA somehow “loses” the tower communications tapes,” Jeff says. “I am seeking other MUFON members who monitor air-traffic communications on the aviation band (108-138 Mhz) and who would like to participate in this project.” If you have an interest in this project, contact Jeff Hahn at jhahn72@yahoo.com. publicly in Budd Hopkins’ 1996 book Witnessed ). What is ironic about Giuliani’s exchange with the boy in New Hamp- shire is that it was in Exeter, the site of the infamous UFO events of September 1965. This dramatic and lengthy sighting by a young man and two police officers was recounted in John G. Fuller’s classic 1966 book Incident at Exeter. Is it Important to Ask? In any case, do isolated questions to stumping Presidential candidates help at all regarding governmental disclosure of UFO information? Consider this: Giuliani told the boy that he hadn’t been asked a question like his before, and then explained to the Exeter audience how he typically is asked the same questions over and over, from all over the country, which indicates to him how Americans every- where are interested in the same issues. Giuliani appears to have hit the nail on the head. How will our Presidential candidates wake up to the concerns some Americans have about the high volume of unexplained UFO sightings and any governmental cover-ups, if nobody’s asking them about this topic as they speak with voters, day in and day out, all across our nation? In other words, it is vital that if UFO disclosure is an issue that truly matters to that person, when one meets a Presidential candidate, they must seize the opportunity and ask the questions. So, realistically, what effect might this have? At least while the candidates are campaigning, they have to be polite and listen to those who might vote for them. After they get elected, good luck trying to bend their ear. If you can ask a candidate about UFOs on camera or on the radio, and it gets widely broadcast, it can reach many other voters who may have never considered this a political issue before. Better yet, others may want to ask this same candidate or other candidates a similar question, given the chance. If a candidate who was asked about UFOs should be elected Presi- dent, he or she will have a greater awareness of the UFO reality, and hopefully will realize that not all of the American populace is somehow oblivious to this truly monumental issue. Admittedly, this isn’t to say they will follow through if elected (recent Presidents like Ford, Carter, Reagan, and Clinton all made provocative statements about UFOs at some point in their political careers that got some people excited that they’d actually spill the beans). The intent here is just that, if asked about UFOs on the campaign trail, a future President will understand that the issue is alive and well in public sentiment. To voters who do not believe that UFOs are traversing our skies and, worse yet, paying house calls, a chuckle and a one-liner by a Presiden- tial candidate is more than enough to handle these rare questions on the campaign trail, but, to those voters who have experienced the UFO phenomenon first-hand, how chilling it is to hear candidates laugh it off. Romney and Giuliani were, at the very least, good sports and, to his credit, Romney didn’t even play the giggle-factor card. There are a good many other candidates out there. Concerned MUFON voters should get out there ask them about UFOs now while they can (and ask often!) until those running for our nation’s highest office under- stand this is an issue of substantial concern to many Americans. Good luck.

Sparks responds here. Stan Friedman wrote that he was unable to get a copy of Brad Sparks’ and Barry Greenwood’s MUFON 2007 paper “The Secret Pratt Tapes and the Origins of MJ-12” in advance of the Sympo- sium, and he was prepared for the worst. Sparks Response: MUFON officially turned down Stan’s request for an advance copy of the article. Friedman: ...Brad made clear he was opposed to the Extra- terrestrial Hypothesis and the reality of both Roswell and Majestic 12. He [hinted] that he may have found some undis- closed information allowing for possible Roswell reality. He didn’t deal with the enormous evidence available. Sparks: I didn’t “deal with” it because the paper was on Pratt’s files and MJ-12, not on Roswell, “enormous evidence” or not. I also told the MUFON audience that I was openly seeking pro- ETH evidence, and that I had been forced to rethink my skeptical position on Roswell because of new evidence of a Top Secret U.S. policy response to Roswell in 1947. But again the paper was not directly on Roswell and I simply wanted to be fair on what my position was. F: His [Brad’s] main focus was on the newly released informa- tion in the papers from the late journalist Robert Pratt... [donated to MUFON]... [especially] the transcripts of tapes of Bob’s conversations with William Moore and with Rick Doty, Bill’s insider contact with the US Air Force Office of Special Investigations (AFOSI). S: Pratt’s tapes were with Moore not Doty. F: Brad’s thesis seems to be that since Moore passed on every- thing to Doty that he and I learned from our Roswell research, that Doty just fed it back as phony documents. For example, he [Brad] tried to dismiss the Eisenhower Briefing Document (EBD) as just an emulation of an earlier Aquarius document that is phony... S: Moore specifically told me that he was passing every scrap of his and Stan’s Roswell data and UFO data to AFOSI. Moore has described how his briefing of Doty was translated into the fake Aquarius Carter Briefing just a few months later, in March 1983. I didn’t say that the EBD was an “emulation” of the Aquarius Carter document. I quoted Pratt’s transcripts and documents showing that years before EBD showed up in 1984, there was an Aquarius Eisenhower Briefing document of November 1952 described, Eisenhower was purportedly briefed, MJ-12 was both a committee of 12 and a security marking on documents, all just like the EBD. F: He claims that the Cutler Twining (CT) memo of July 14, 1954, is just an emulation of a memo Bill Moore and I had found at the Library of Congress ... in the papers of General Nathan Twining... This claim frankly seems absurd. S: It is not so “absurd” when one reads what Stan himself has written about the “very similar” (his words not mine) genuine Cutler-Twining memos he and Moore had found in 1981, which would have been given to Doty and AFOSI years before the admittedly “planted” CT memo was found with its bogus “MJ- 12” reference. 1 Stan wrote in his TS/Majic book, “In addition to similarities in what the memos say, there are similarities in what they don’t say.” For an example of similarity in what they don’t say, he wrote that “Neither gives any clue as to the subject of the meetings to which they refer...” (p. 93) F: Friedman compares the MJ-12 related Cutler Twining memo, to the earlier July 13, 1953, memo from Cutler to Twining about an all day meeting at the White House on July 16, 1953. S: Stan goes on and on about the Cutler memos here when it was only a long footnote in my MUFON paper and not directly relevant to the Pratt files. Stan claims there is “only” one “common item” between the genuine and the “planted” Cutler Memos, yet in his books and papers he has recited numerous similarities which I agree with Stan on, but which he now appar- ently wishes us to forget he had ever pointed out: 1. language; 2. style; 3. format; 4. typeface; 5. overall impression (“imme- diately reminded” Stan of genuine CTM); 6. concluding words; 7. specific details to be given only at the meeting; 8. similarities in what they “don’t say” as well as what they do say. F: Brad tries to make a big deal about my comments about similarity, hardly the same as emulation. The security classi- fications are different as is much else. S: It is Stan who made a “big deal” of the similarities in his book, not me. I’m just quoting him and agreeing with him. Stan wrote in his TS/Majic book that “ the language, style, format, and typeface” of the planted Cutler memo checked out with the genuine Cutler memos (p. 92). Similarity of “language, style, format, and typeface” certainly includes the security classifi- cation markings. In fact the memos were so similar that when Stan first heard the MJ-12 version read even he was “imme- diately reminded” of the genuine Cutler Memo. Stan said the “concluding words of the two memos are virtually the same” and “another similarity in wording is the indication that specific details will be given at the meeting only.” (p. 93) F: Friedman wrote that the phrase “In the absence of contrary word your concurrence in the above arrangements is assumed” was standard phraseology indicating that no response was needed, [according to] William McVey (Twining’s pilot and aide...)... The similarity of this one sentence [between the two letters] is an indication of genuineness not fakery. S: Stan forgets that the UFO investigator must, according to Hynek, eliminate conventional explanations first, including possible hoax. A mere “indication” of genuineness (which I Brad Sparks Responds to Stan Friedman’s Rebuttal to Sparks-Greenwood Symposium Paper 1 Friedman, MJ-12 Update, Oct. 31, 1987, p. 3; Top Secret/Majic p. 91."},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"November 2007 12 MUFON UFO Journal With this month’s issue, we begin a feature spotlighting MUFON members whose selfless dedication to MUFON should be publicly recognized. This month we feature Charles C. Reever, the Director of Investigations and Field Investigator Training and thank him for his enthusiast support of MUFON’s mission and goals. Chuck Reever was born in Southern California and attended Santa Monica College and U.C.L.A. From a very early age he was interested in Astronomy and read many books on the subject. Throughout all of WWII there were anti-aircraft emplacements everywhere in Los Angeles and Chuck remembers the excitement of the “air raid” over Los Angeles by “Objects” unknown. There were aircraft “dog fights” with P-38s and P-40s over West Los Angeles and Santa Monica residential areas; some of these planes were manufactured at the Douglass Aircraft Company in Santa Monica, California. Chuck remembers very well in July of 1947 reading in the newspaper (the now defunct Los Angeles Daily News ) about the crash at Roswell and thinking, Oh Boy, now we will know , and then reading the next day that the debris was simply a crash of a weather balloon. In 1962 Chuck had his first UFO sighting. He observed a huge triangle of 1/4 to 1/3 mile in size, at perhaps 3,000 feet altitude. It was traveling very slow (5 mph?), made no sound, and then blinked” out.

F: I had noted a number of real emulations in the Tim Cooper phony MJ-12 documents as I reported in the 2 nd edition of TOP SECRET/MAJIC and in Majestic 12 Update...[which] Brad doesn’t reference.... The CT memo is definitely NOT an emula- tion of the July 13, 1953, memo. It also has a very interesting slant red pencil mark through the very unusual security marking of TOP SECRET RESTRICTED. ...The red pencil mark was standard practice when a document was to be declassified .... The earlier letter has no red pencil... Cutler was out of the country so couldn’t have signed it. S: I agree with Stan when he wrote in his TS/Majic book that the “planted” Cutler memo was red penciled by someone who was “apparently well aware of the red pencil convention” used by AF document reviewers and that the red pencil was a “perfectly natural thing for somebody accustomed to” such security review matters to use (p. 97), namely AFOSI agents heavily involved in security matters. Any such AF documents planters or hoaxers would have had to learn about the AF security reviewers’ work in order to carefully “plant” the CTM. Stan himself said the Cutler memo was “planted” by knowledgeable AF personnel (TS/Majic, pp. 91, 97). There is nothing in the planted MJ-12 Cutler memo that says anything at all about Cutler being out of the country or even away from his office. The carbon is simply unsigned, as was often done with carbons regardless whether the signator was in the office or not. An unsigned document is easier to forge since signatures are difficult to fake. Stan has no way of knowing what Doty did or did not “know” based on something that is not even stated in the document. F: Brad’s dismissal of the EBD is shallow. He claims the fatal error is that the EBD says the distance to the crash site was “approximately 75 miles northwest of Roswell Army Air Base” when the driving distance on one route was 102 miles and the GPS distance is about 62 miles. Why would Hillenkoetter (briefing officer) use the word approximately if he was trying to be precise? Obviously it didn’t matter. S: If the distance didn’t matter then why was it included at all in the EBD? It is a fatal error in the EBD hoax and Stan can’t refute it. Stan ignores the fact that the mistaken 75-mile distance figure only comes from the 1980 Berlitz-Moore Roswell Incident book and it was mindlessly repeated by the EBD hoaxer in 1984. No one was publishing different figures. It’s like a fingerprint pointing to the only possible source. Since the real world distance was 62 miles the 75-mile blunder could not come from reality. And the word “approximately” does not rescue the EBD from fraudulence, since the actual distance is “approxi-mately” 60 miles, not “approximately” 75. F: Furthermore there was an airplane landing strip...not too far from the site [with] lots of small Piper Cubs.... Approximately 75 miles would appear to be a good rounded off number. S: The airstrip is at the same 62-mile distance from Roswell base as the Debris Field, so this argument is irrelevant and it is still utterly ridiculous to call that “approximately” 75 miles. If Stan thinks that is such a “good rounded off number” then I suggest that he let me send him $62 and he can do me a favor and send me back $75 since he thinks those numbers are so close as to not “matter.” F: [Brad’s] second equally questionable concern is the line “Numerous examples of what appear to be a form of writing were found in the wreckage. Efforts to decipher these have remained largely unsuccessful.” ... He points out that, since I later [learned from] the Menzel papers... that Menzel had taught cryptography and learned Japanese, the document if genuine should have said the deciphering was done under Dr. Menzel . S: Menzel is named in the EBD for an astronomy point in the MJ-12 document but not for the cryptanalysis point made right after it, on the same page. The reasonable conclusion is that the MJ-12 author or hoaxer just didn’t know about Menzel’s cryptanalysis background and thus couldn’t mention it where it would have been highly relevant in view of Menzel’s great codebreaking expertise which Stan loves to trumpet. F: How can Brad know why people do what they do and who is telling the truth and what is in unseen documents such as attachment E? Surely that would have gone into detail about the deciphering and presumably Menzel’s role. S: When Stan argues the contents of “unseen documents” he is truly shadowboxing with mirages. Let’s stick to what is “seen” in documents. If I didn’t even mention EBD’s Attach- ment E, as Stan was just complaining about two sentences earlier, then how did I have a discussion of what was in it? This is illogical. Stan also forgets to explain here that, as I had pointed out in the MUFON paper, he has claimed that the EBD does tell about Menzel’s cryptanalysis talents but he just can’t quote where the EBD says that! He claims this as proof of authen- ticity, that the EBD knows something no one else knew, so it must come from a real MJ-12 of vast secret knowledge. Stan writes in his TS/Majic (p. 67) that “there are many details in the briefing [the EBD] that were not known to any of us on the outside at the time. (See Appendix C.)” I looked up Appendix C to find out what “details” in the EBD were mentioned that no one knew about before, the “20 facts” he loves to tout as proof of the EBD. Appendix C lists Menzel’s Connections and Talents, including “association with NSA and predecessor Navy agency” and “Expert cryptanalyst; taught cryptanalysis.” So where are these Menzel-NSA connections and crypt- analysis talents mentioned in the EBD? By reading just the EBD how would anyone know that Menzel had any such cryptan- alysis “talents”? F: Careful review of the EBD finds six [references to] Sparks’ Response Continued from page 11 Continued on page 14"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"November 2007 14 MUFON UFO Journal Continued from page 13 ...Attachment B, or C, etc., [and]... no name is mentioned. When Bronk and Menzel are mentioned there is no [reference to an] Attachment. ... Hillenkoetter was tidy and consistent. S: This is truly desperate argument as well as being factually wrong. Stan contends that Menzel was simply not named in the EBD as codebreaking the alleged Roswell alien writings because Eisenhower was told to just read up on it in a supposed “Attachment E,” maybe as bedtime reading. Stan claims that whenever such a shortcut of referring to Attach- ments in the EBD was done then no MJ-12 member’s name is mentioned, a few words or names of space is saved that way and everything supposedly is more “tidy.” Flat out wrong! MJ- 12 members Bush and Forrestal are named right next to a “See Attachment ‘A’” reference. Couldn’t Eisenhower have just read Attachment A and some space have been saved in the briefing document? F: ... Brad doesn’t [mention] that the EBD notes that “on 07 July 1947, a secret operation was begun to assure recovery of the wreckage.” But I didn’t determine that Twining had indeed gone to New Mexico on July 7 until much later.... I listed more than 20 facts not known until later [which he also ignored]. Does his strong anti-Roswell and anti-MJ-12 bias interfere with his objectivity? S: In years past Stan has said that the start of the Roswell recovery operation was actually on July 6, 1947, beginning with Marcel and Cavitt going out to the Debris Field to recover the UFO debris, not with Twining’s later flight on July 7. The Roswell Incident book has a misprint where the Sunday July 6 meeting of Brazel with Sheriff Wilcox, leading to Marcel’s recovery operation, was mistakenly typed as “July 7,” which was Monday. I didn’t ignore the purported “20 facts not known until later,” ( Appendix C in Stan’s TS/Majic book). I specifically pointed out in my paper (p. 104) that these supposed “20 facts” include Menzel’s cryptanalysis talents yet the EBD itself “knows” nothing about Menzel as a cryptanalyst and Stan cannot quote where EBD says anything at all about Menzel as the great codecracker. Does Stan’s strong pro-MJ-12 bias interfere with his objectivity and cause him to see nonexistent text in the EBD purportedly talking about Menzel as a crypt- analyst before anyone knew about that “secret life?” F: Brad makes a big deal about the ongoing battle between the Army and Air Force vs. the Navy . S: Stan misses my point about inter-service rivalry and how it affects UFO history. I gave numerous specifics (see the October Journal summary of my paper). Does he deny it? F: ...he stresses that [NASA] is a civilian agency.... There is no mention of the fact that NASA has sponsored lots of classified work.... S: I never said NASA had no classified work, this is a bogus strawman argument. My article pointed out massive evidence of Doty/AFOSI foisting disinformation that falsely blamed NASA for the AF’s own UFO coverup, including even trying to blame NASA for the Cash-Landrum UFO injuries, going so far as to make an air force base into a secret “NASA” base in order to shift the blame. Stan ignores all that. F: There seems to have been a disagreement between Brad and Barry about claims that documents were faked just to make money for Moore, Doty, and maybe Pratt, who would work with Moore on a [never published] fiction book about MJ-12 with Doty as a kind of silent partner. S: Barry had zero facts showing MJ-12 was a greed-motivated hoax, and had a number of false assertions which he couldn’t or wouldn’t document which had to be removed (e.g., he claimed Ellsworth was an “admitted” Doty hoax). F: He also claimed that Pratt had secretly taped his conversa- tions with Moore, Doty, etc. Mrs. Pratt, in Denver to accept a posthumous award for Bob for his outstanding UFO journalism, was very upset at the use of the term “secretly.” Brad provided no evidence that the other party was unaware of Bob’s taping. Bob kept copious notes and openly taped as much as he could... [in] his consistent effort to be accurate. S: Mrs. Pratt never talked to me in the Denver MUFON confer- ence about any such concerns.* In any case, Pratt secretly taped Donald Keyhoe phone calls as well as with Moore, and there is not a shred of evidence to the contrary. Nothing on the tapes contains permission to tape and “careful” reporters make sure that is recorded. F: Brad apparently believes that, since there is a dearth of official documents so far relating to Roswell and/or MJ-12, they must not have been real. The old absence of evidence is evidence for absence ploy. ... [There are] still literally tons of classified material that haven’t seen the light of day. ... I am reminded of a number of UFO sightings in which the witness can’t separate observation from interpretation. The paper has too much “interpretation.” S: Stan is again appealing to “absence of evidence as evidence of presence, ” the exact reverse of his trite saying. This is a God- of-the-gaps argument, that the proof of a mystery is in the gaps in the evidence, the thing not yet seen or found. This is not “evidence,” it is a lack of evidence, it is hocus-pocus. Readers should go to the 2007 MUFON Proceedings article and judge for themselves based on evidence not non-evidence. As I quoted Stan earlier, he wrote in his TS/Majic book that the MJ-12 documents “must have been created by an insider” such as “insider ... Richard Doty of OSI.” I agree. Stan needs to agree with himself and close the case. Brad Sparks * Editor’s Note: Mrs. Pratt did speak to me immediately following Mr. Sparks’ presentation. She was very upset, insisting that her husband never “secretly taped” anyone.

Friedman Stanton Friedman Opening the Cosmic Watergate? Every so often I am asked when I expect disclosure from the U.S. Gov- ernment about UFOs. My answer is always that I have no idea and have seen no signs of anything happening soon. But what about the Disclosure Project and the Big Exopolitics move- ment? Again I see no particular evi- dence that either group is making any progress except perhaps in publicity for the guys in charge. Yes, there are some good people who have provided strong cases to the Disclosure Project. Robert Salas, for example, presented an excellent paper at the MUFON 2007 Symposiuim about the intriguing events at Malmstrom Air Force base on March 16, 1967. I believe Disclosure has made too little use of government documents to prove there has been a cover-up and that there is serious evidence for visitations to planet Earth by aliens. It has also linked the UFO cover-up with supposed free energy systems suppo- sedly being withheld, but without providing any evidence thereof. The Exopolitics guys, as I have noted before, talk very big with grandiose notions of peaceful aliens and blind acceptance of every so called whistle- blower story that comes down the pike. They have, for example, hyped former Canadian Defense Minster Paul Hellyer’s opinions, but without support- ing them with data. I’ve been asked, “All right, Stan, what would you like to see done to put everything about UFOs out on the table?” My answer, of course, is that I don’t want to see technical data out on the table where it is readily available to any rich madman wanting to increase his own power on the world scene. As I have repeatedly noted, one cannot tell one’s friends without telling one’s enemies. What would I want to see? I would like to see some major media group ( New York Times, Washington Post, 60 Minutes, Time, Newsweek, US News and World Report, USA Today, et al ), put as much effort into blowing the lid off the Cosmic Watergate as was put into disclosing the political Watergate. It wasn’t just Woodward and Bernstein. For example, there were many people following the money. By that, I mean let’s provide chapter and verse about a host of government lies about UFOs— going back to Roswell, to Blue Book Special Report 14 , to the many lies about the annual UFO statistics, to the many attempts to shoot down UFOs in the 1950s, to the cases of airplanes being downed by UFOs. I give a number of these lies on my website (see “Government UFO Lies”). I would like to see a compilation of huge black budget projects—about which we now know—by the National Reconnaissance Office, by the Naval Research Laboratory, by Lockheed, etc, showing that secrets can indeed be kept. There are still media and other people claiming that secrets can’t be kept, despite the evidence to the contrary such as the multi-billion dollar Corona and Poppy satellite programs, the Stealth fighter, etc. There were those 166 military crew members of reconnaissance planes shot down by the Russians whose families were lied to for decades. I would like to see a major effort made to get amnesty for military witnesses who know of important UFO events perhaps at least 50 years ago. This would include demonstrating that the standard Air Force lines about “no threat to the security of the United States” are frankly nonsense. In TOP SECRET/MAJIC I have a five-page response to USAF Colonel Thomas Shubert’s grossly misleading page of statements to Senator Patty Murray. I would like to see a full blown effort to get at the “reports of UFOs which could affect national Security (and) are not part of the Blue Book System” according to General Carroll Bolender (October 20, 1969). The public has never been informed about them and yet these CIRVIS Reports are, by far, more important than run-of-the-mill UFO sightings. Retired General Thomas Jefferson DuBose, chief of Staff to General Roger Ramey in Fort Worth Texas in July, 1947, told me he liked what I was doing and would tell me if he recalled anything more. He said “What can they do to me now?” How many others feel the same way about their UFO event involvement? One example of persons involved in classified activities who finally came forward to tell the truth was the My Lai massacre in Vietnam on March 16, 1968. People of good conscience did come forward. One man, Ron Ridenhour, had worked hard to get the My Lai story out with no luck despite many letters. Finally, when Pulitzer Prize winning journalist Seymour Hersh published the story, a number of other"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"November 2007 16 MUFON UFO Journal witnesses came forward. Nobody wants to take all the risk on his own, but there is strength in numbers. I frequently hear quick stories of fascinating cases. How can these people who have experienced UFOs be found? National publicity such as a call for witnesses in editorials while providing a guarantee of anonymity, a toll free number, a mailing address, e-mail address might well do it. Think how successful “America’s Most Wanted” has been at finding criminals wanted by the authorities. The key is to spread a very wide net. How about petitions by members of various technical societies such as the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics to set up a committee and collect data? One major goal might be to find former Navy personnel involved with observations from ships at sea and from Navy aircraft flying from aircraft carriers. Truth-seekers have focused primarily on the Air Force, but oceans cover three-quarters of the planet. I think it is time to reach these “lost witnesses.” While several astronauts have spoken out, NASA has certainly obtained more data via surveillance systems, astronaut flights, and so on, than has been revealed to the public. There are some people who think that, since NASA is supposedly a civilian agency, everything it does is in the open. I certainly worked on programs co-sponsored by NASA which involved classified data such as the nuclear rocket program. NASA was a direct outgrowth in 1958 of the old National Advisory Committee on Aeronautics (NACA) which did loads of military research and development. Another important aspect of any attempt to get reluctant witnesses to come forward is to have more of us in ufology stop being apologist ufologists and closet ufologists. This might mean a frontal attack on the nasty noisy negativists such as Dr. Michael Shermer. I had a lot of excellent feedback regarding my confrontation of Shermer on the Larry King Show on July 13 and on Coast to Coast radio on August 1. We need to confront the ancient academics and fossilized physicists to show they haven’t studied the evidence, know little about security and are unaware of relevant physics. I am so sick of hearing PhDs rant about Einstein and the limit of the speed of light, but totally ignoring the rest of the Einstein story—specifically that time slows down for things moving close to the speed of light. I have no qualms about pointing out how far off past pronouncements have been about the possibility of flight in airplanes, of orbiting satellites, of flights to the moon, because the so-called expert knew almost nothing about the processes involved despite having a PhD. I’m thinking that my next book— after Flying Saucers and Science (New Page Books of Career Press, 2008)— should be It’s Impossible? Isn’t It?, exposing the totally wrong reasoning of well educated people talking about subjects about which they know almost nothing. There are many examples. Furthermore, there needs to be serious international discussions about concerns which would arise if a big announcement were to be made about the presence of UFOs on earth. A major concern should be who speaks for the Planet—surely not the president of the United States. But would there be elections, appointments by major governments to an international Conference? Have there been requests from aliens to existing governments about establishing trade deals? Could an international conference be held of representatives of major religions? Obviously it would be useful to know if there have been past interactions between aliens and earthlings, perhaps described in the “myths” and “legends” of ancient civilizations. Have there already been discussions on a semi- official level between Earthlings and representatives from outer space? Has permission been given for abductions of Earthlings? How much work has been done to review the mind control aspects that show up in many abductions? Surely every government would like to know how to get enemy soldiers to drop their weapons using telepathy or some such technique. We know there were hotlines linking government officials in the USA with similar officials in the Soviet Union. Have there been discussions about flying saucers observed by radar and spy satellites of each country to reassure the other that what just flew by was just one of those saucers and not a missile from our country? A serious article in an English language Soviet publication pointed out that it is very important for the USA and the Soviet Union to be able to distinguish between a UFO and a missile or aircraft from the other country to avoid starting a war. NARCAP (The National Aviation Reporting Center for Anomalous Phenomena) has collected literally thousands of reports of Unidentified Aerial Phenomena. Could airlines and pilot groups be openly solicited in an effort to obtain reports from their employees without fear of ridicule or job consequences? There are many military reunion groups whose members have had good sightings. Is there a way to tap these sources especially if amnesty is offered, and if a focus is on older cases to avoid revealing new technology? I think it can be done. Sure it would help if there was a big money grant, but past exposes have been funded by media groups interested in truth followed by profit. It is easy to prove the public is interested, Maybe a letter (or email writing campaign) would convince the media powers that there is data, there is interest, there is gold in them thar hills.

Congressman Kucinich “had a close sighting over my home in Graham, Washington, when I lived there,” the actress, a close Kucinich friend, wrote. “Dennis found his encounter extremely moving. “The smell of roses drew him out to my balcony where, when he looked up, he saw a gigantic triangular craft, silent, and observing him. It hovered, soundless, for 10 minutes or so, and sped away with a speed he couldn’t comprehend.

I was thinking that some of the lights might be bonfires on the San Carlos Indian Reservation, but I began feeling uneasy. It was pitch dark and very quiet at that time of night and I was several miles from town Note: These reports are presented in order to keep readers informed of some of the vast number of sightings being reported. Hoewever, these cases have not bee officially investigated, unless noted. when I saw a huge object that reminded me of a throwing discus; to my right were two more of them. The craft appeared to be 300 feet or more in diameter and flying in sort of a staggered trail formation. The first one was about 500 feet above me; the second was 50 feet to 100 feet higher. The last one was about 50 to 100 feet above the second one. I was on high ground, as they passed over me, they descended to just above the desert floor. They remained in a level attitude as they descended. They seemed to be maintaining a constant height above the ground. I saw neither windows nor lights on them. They glowed a very faint emerald color. They did cast a very dim light on the ground as they passed over. I heard no noise at all. After they passed me, the three of them became a point of light because of the distance. When they approached Mt Baldy, they made a sharp turn to the right and flew out of sight to the east. I counted the seconds until they turned east. Later, I became a Navy pilot, and measured the distance that they covered on a map, then using the seconds I counted, I calculated a speed which is probably way off the actual speed. I was excited and probably counted too fast, but at the time, I believe they were doing almost 9000 miles per hour. California SAN MARCOS— On October 7, 2007, I went outside for a smoke after dinner at 6:15 PM, and spotted a glowing amber rectangular object with a multicolored assembly of geometric shapes directly beneath. It was no more than a half a mile away at maybe 2000 feet. I grabbed my binoculars and focused on an unidentifiable thing below the amber rectangle that flipped over, maintaining its position below the rectangle. Two of my neighbors also caught sight of it and I had the impression they were frightened. I told them I’d seen it through my binoculars, and it was not a helicopter. The rectangle was steady with no wobble but the geometric shapes did another flip. They were geometric reflective and red, green, blue, and gold. I heard a jet and found it with the binoculars, and then looked for the object and it was gone just like that.

The FAA has ruled a 16-inch-long piece of metal, which fell from the sky in Delaware Monday, October 17, 2007, was not part of an airplane. The object landed with enough force to blow right through the roof of an SUV, and was hot enough to still be smoldering when firefighters arrived. “The metal was still too hot to handle,” Delaware State Police spokesman Cpl. Jeff Whitmarsh told the Wilmington News-Journal. Photos from the scene show a metal object that looks a little like a piece of construction rebar bent into the shape of the Greek letter omega. The impact on the SUV sounded like an explosion. Could it be a piece of space junk which re-entered after its orbit decayed? Or is it a cotter pin from a huge alien spacecraft? http://www .aero- news.net/index.cfm?

I initially thought it was a flare rising at a 45 degree angle but it leveled out and traveled for roughly three seconds south, and then without a turning motion began moving north in the opposite direction. At that time another light moved up to roughly the same elevation as the first light. The two lights then began traveling back and forth and up and down very strangely. I pointed at the object and asked “Do you see that?” The witness also saw them as another object appeared from a cloud bank and joined the other two. All three objects were moving erratically and completely independently of each other for about four more minutes. About fifteen more people began looking at the objects as well making exclamations of excitement and amazement. My train arrived at 5:31PM and I boarded but within thirty seconds we experienced a furious hail storm. After the hail cleared I saw two military fighter jets traveling at an extremely high rate of speed and very low toward the location the objects were originally sighted. The objects looked like very bright stars and their speed was amazingly fast. I con- tacted WGN News and ABC News during the evening to see if anyone had reported the lights. Thanks to Peter Davenport, http://www .ufocenter .com/ Missouri Saucer with Dome COLUMBIA —I was driving on Highway Z about seven miles north of Columbia on October 15, 2007, at 6:58 PM and saw something with a dull matte gray color. It looked like two inverted contact lenses stuck together to make a domed disc shape with a little square turret on top. It had a large round blue/white light on one side that always faced toward the viewer. It was dark and the blue/white light was bright. A vehicle was stopped on the other side of the road with three occupants in it, watching the object. I pulled over, and turned my vehicle off to see if I could hear anything. One of the males yelled over to me and asked if I saw it. I answered, “Yes, that’s why I stopped, but I don’t know what it is.” The object would stay in one spot for a while, then move very slowly, then stop, then move again, never with any noise. It finally arced around and moved faster away towards the northwest. Investigator’s Notes: The witness has described a “classic flying saucer.” Considering that the clouds were fairly low the object must have been flying low. I have been unable to reach the witness to obtain any additional information. Thanks to Bill Puckett UFOS Northwest http:// ufosnw.com/ Nebraska Large Craft Makes a U-turn LINCOLN —We witnessed a strange sight on October 10, 2007 at 8:30 PM. I can only describe it as a very large aircraft, no lights, no sound, faint but visible against the night sky. Imagine a boomerang shape, but smoothed out at the curve. It flew north for a few seconds, then made far too sharp turn-around for a normal aircraft, and continued back to the south. We lost track of it after that. It was visible to us for several minutes. Four of us saw it in this south neighborhood. Thanks to Brian Vike - Director of HBCC UFO Research and radio host of the Vike Report. http://www.hbccufo.org/ New Jersey Flying Triangle FORKED RIVER —I was returning home from work driving Lacey Road, a remote stretch of road in the Pine Barrens at about 11:20 PM on September 15, 2007. I was chatting on my cell to a friend, when I saw two very bright objects flying too low for most planes. They were triangular in shape and had two very bright blue lights on the side and a red light on the back. They flew slowly very close together and then one changed position and hovered above the other. I had another driver on my tail so I slowed down and when I looked up they had disappeared into cloud cover. We are close to Fort Dix so this has to be a weird Army thing right? Thanks to Peter Davenport Director http:// www .ufocenter .com. MAPLE SHADE— A county government official called me on Monday, October 22, 2007, to tell me there were numerous lights above his home maneuvering and flying in wild patterns about 9:30 PM. At first he thought they might be search lights but they continued until to after 10 PM. He was contacting the police. BLAIRSTOWN— I spoke to Joe who stated, “While I was going to bed at 9:30 PM, on October 14, 2007, my wife and I saw outside our window a huge triangular craft with lights at its ends showing me the shape.” It was flying slowly north at 3000 feet altitude and probably had been following the Delaware River north and passed over the power plant. Commercial aircraft flew near this object but did not seem bothered by it. Since I did not see the actual body of the craft, but there were lights on the three corners that made me think that it was manmade. I mean why would a craft like this show running lights? This craft did not make a sound? I woke my wife to show her and we would have loved to see its body. Had I had foresight I would have taken a picture and used an optical device to look at it. Thanks to Joe Zerres MUFON CMS New York Strange Lights Seen on Lake Ontario NIAGARA —For almost a month now my daughter and I have been watching the sky at the golf course along the lake. We seem to be seeing what look like stars at first, but actually have a circle in the middle with lines on either side. We brought out the binoculars and were able to see flashing red, blue, green and amber colored lights. Eventually they would just disappear. What I can’t understand is how these things can hover in the same coordinates for hours. This would be September into last evening which is October 14, 2007. Thanks to Brian Vike.

A triangular formation of blue lights was seen over the river which resembled L.E.D lights. The group proceeded to watch as the lights hovered for some time, blinking in a pattern, and then moved off into the distance. Several days later, Jackie my friend reported that at least twenty other people had watched the same formation. A group of her friends had been out in the wilderness near the quarry on Lime City Road on the other side of the Maumee River. They encoun- tered an 8 foot tall black, anthropomorphic creature that walked very slowly several feet in front of her, as if it purposefully wanted to be seen. Thanks to Peter Davenport Director http:// www .ufocenter .com 1946 UFO Sighting in Oklahoma COYLE —Sammie Binkley writes, “It was a clear spring day in l946, in the small town of Coyle at about 9 AM, when my Mother and I saw a flight of UFOs. We were in the west side yard looking at the tulip leaves that had just forced their way up about an inch in the flower bed. I looked up and saw what looked like small objects surrounded by strips of metallic ribbon. I said, ‘Mother, look, an airplane must have dropped some toys or something.’ She glanced up, looked at me and said, ‘There hasn’t been a plane go over.’ ” “The objects, which were just dots in the sky at first, came down in a long spiral, each above and to the side of the lower one. They were slowly rotating in a clockwise movement. As they got closer they looked like a child’s top, round and narrowing at the bottom. About a quarter of the way down there appeared to be a row of windows that went totally around the objects. The bottom was flat but had three dark spots in a triangle which could have been recessed wheels. The “ribbons” I had first seen were white and red lights that were flashing from the tops—the red light was not the bright red of an emergency vehicle but darker, almost a maroon. There were nine of the “tops.” They were metallic but not bright like aluminum—nearer to pewter color. They were large, about the size of a double garage. “There was an electric pole in back of our garage that was, I guess, a transformer —lines from all over town converged there. The objects came down, one at a time and sat, unmoving, slightly above the electric lines. After about four or five minutes they would ascend, take their place at the top of the spiral and the lowest one would come down and sit. There was never the slightest sound, no whistle, hum or anything. It was so quiet it reminded me of the calm just before a storm hits—even the birds were mute. It took approximately 45 minutes to an hour for all of them to do this and then they suddenly, in the blink of an eye, swept into a V formation and flew west. This was so fast that they literally disappeared before our eyes. I have been interested ever since this event in finding out what UFOs are. I was 17 at the time, ready to start college and my mother was 37 and an avid bird watcher that could identify a bird sitting in a tree a mile away so I don’t think there is any chance that we saw a bunch of birds or weather balloons.” Thanks to Sammie Binkley Oregon V-Shaped Distortion LINCOLN BEACH —About 9:30 PM, on October 15, 2007, I was out on my front porch 70 miles south of Portland, near the Pacific Ocean and saw a very, huge and very fast V-shaped distortion pass in front of the Milky Way. The sky was so clear and there were so many stars, that I could clearly see the shape. I would swear that it wasn’t a shadow, but that it was invisible. Like it was distorting the light behind it, not blacking it out. I see a lot of jets pass over. This was much bigger, and faster, and silent. It made no noise as it passed overhead. It was like a distortion of the stars and Milky Way behind it. There were so many stars that I could clearly see its shape. It was just a moving pattern of distortion traveling from the north to directly south. I have attached a drawing of the shape. The whole event took 30 seconds. Investigator’s Note : This is one of many sightings of a “V” shaped triangular object that our group has received during the past few years. The witness is very explicit in his report and clearly this sighting was not of a “conventional aircraft.” The shadow and distortion of stars are somewhat reminiscent of the Phoenix Lights sightings in March of 1997. Thanks to Bill Puckett UFOS Northwest http://ufosnw .com / Texas Meteor May Cover UFO Entry DALLAS — Peter Davenport writes: NUFORC received four reports on October 19, 2007, of a very dramatic meteor to the north of Dallas and Fort Worth. However, two independent witnesses have reported that immediately following the apparent meteor, six “balls of orange light” rose up from the horizon, maneuvered, dimmed, and then one shot off at an astonishing velocity. Thanks to Peter Davenport Director http://www .ufocenter .com/ (Filer’s) Editor’s Note: Assuming we are dealing with intelligence life forms aboard UFOs entering our atmosphere, they may choose to closely follow a meteor into the atmosphere, or to make their entry appear as a meteor. Even though spectacular meteors are often observed the actual meteorites are seldom found even though they are quite valuable. Green meteors apparently do not actually exist in nature and often signal the entry of alien craft. These objects are called Fastwalkers or uncorrelated targets. They are not in the Air Force Data Base of known objects in space, thus the name uncorrelated. I’m told several times a week an uncorrelated target enters and exits our atmosphere indicating there are regular supply missions for our visitors.

Washington Disc About 35 Feet CLE ELUM — I was driving on the freeway about 7 PM, and saw a bluish-gray disc in the sky about 600-700 feet altitude on October 17, 2007. The weather was clear, raining slightly (mist). The disc seemed to be hovering over the little town of Cle Elum, so I pulled over to watch. It would bobble slightly, but otherwise stay in one position. This lasted for about five minutes and then it just disappeared. Investigator’s Notes: This sighting has similar characteristics to a sighting over Lake Easton on October 10, 2007. The two sightings were only about 15 miles apart. LAKE EASTON —I saw a silver/gray disc about 35 feet radius hovering over Lake Easton for 3-5 minutes on October 10, 2007 around 10:40 PM. I saw a beam of very bright greenish light which illuminated the lake. Then we saw small objects floating up to the craft. My friend said they were fish. Investigator’s Note: Reports of unknown objects gathering material are rare. Thanks to Bill Puckett UFOS Northwest http://ufosnw .com/ (Filer’s) Editor’s Note : Sightings of discs in the Northwest have been reported for more than fifty years by hundreds of witnesses. The occupants are often seen foraging for food and water. Fish, elk, deer and other animals appear to be taken on a regular basis. This pattern provides evidence for an intelligent species that needs food to sustain life. Recently, I was contacted by a Forest Ranger who claimed that Rangers see them on a regular basis. Germany Lights GELSENKIRCHEN —On Sunday morning, September 16, 2007, around 8:15 PM, I was out on my girlfriend’s tenth floor balcony and noticed a bright light with an aura around it flying east. Suddenly another light appeared to the left side of the first object and started getting brighter and adjusted its speed to the first one. I noticed a pedestrian below and pointed, and he saw it too. The objects were moving together when the second light suddenly made a sharp 90 degree left turn, speeded up and dimmed out. The first one was now nearly over me as it rapidly dimmed out and disappeared. At that moment I noticed interference on my radio. Thanks to Peter Davenport Director http://www .ufocenter .com/ Ireland Red Lights On September 21, 2007, about 4:52 AM, I saw a cylinder shaped UFO, a long red line with red lights blinking on and off.

Thanks to Peter Davenport Director http:// www .ufocenter .com/ Norway Huge Bright Disc Light KRISTIANSAND —It was amazing, at first I just saw a huge bright light in the sky right above the tree-line. It was so huge I called for a buddy of mine to look and got my telescope, and saw there were two white/bright lights fairly close to each other, with a red light beam going downwards in a pattern movement. This was in between the two bright round lights at each side of the disc. I had it in my sights for maybe 45 seconds as moved behind the tree-line, but then flew higher and I could see that it was a black disc shaped object in the middle of two bright lights. It was moving slow and then it turned again towards my buddy and me and flew almost over us totally silent. We both saw it in the scope. The white and red lights were fairly small so if this object was that high in the air this means the object had to be seriously huge.

About an hour ago, I noticed this red flickering ball in the sky and thirty seconds into my walk, I saw several people standing in their garden and heard them say “Here comes some more, they are quite evenly spaced out!” I looked over my shoulder and sure enough there was a pair of UFOs, totally silent and flickering red/orange. I phoned my friend and he too saw them! A couple of minutes later, two more came strolling over the horizon, just ambling along. They kept coming minutes apart, then finally one flew by on its own. I must have seen about ten, and judging by the crowd of people in the garden there was more before that!

The top 10 State Directors are highlighted . The report is based on our two measures of UFO Investigation effectiveness. Assigning reports within 72 hours of receipt, and completing all investigations within 90 days of being assigned. The “Assigned” column is a six month running average of the number of cases assigned within 72 hours divided by the total number of cases received in that six month period. The “Completed” column is the number of cases completed beginning sixty-two (62) days back and going back six months from there (for a total of eight months back) divided by the total number of cases reported in the same period. The “Weighted Rank” is just the average of the two columns expressed as a percent. State Directors can improve their scores by being sure to assign all cases within 72 hours, and to follow up with their Field Investigators to ensure all reports are completed within 90 days. To be considered complete, a report must have been investigated and placed in one of the three com- pleted status codes (Unknown, Hoax or IFO) by you the State Director.

Other Celestial Phenomena December 22 nd : Winter Solstice (Marks the first day of winter for earth’s northern hemisphere and first day of summer for the Southern hemisphere). Meteor Showers Geminids: The annual Geminid meteor shower will peak on the night of December 13th/14th. This shower is one of the better showers since as many as 100 meteors per hour may be seen. While this certainly doesn’t rival the Leonids in recent years, this is still a very high rate for a regular meteor shower. This is an unusual shower in that the source of the shower is not believed to be a comet, but rather an object known as 3200 Phaethon. This object is currently classified as an asteroid, but some scientists believe that it might be an extinct comet with a thick crust of interplanetary dust. Another thing that makes the Geminids unusual is that one doesn’t have to wait until after midnight to catch this shower. The radiant rises early and meteors can be seen around 10:00 PM local time, but the best view will still be after midnight local time. This shower also boasts a broad maximum, lasting nearly one whole day, so no matter where you live, you stand a decent chance of catching sight of some Geminids. The actual peak will occur around 4:00 UTC on the 14th (6:40 PM EST, 5:40 CST, 4:40 MST, and 3:40 PM PST on the 13th). Fortunately the Moon will be below the horizon during the peak of the shower. Ursids: The Ursids peak on December 22/ 23 and have a peak hourly rate of 10 or so, but in some years the hourly peak has risen as high as 50.

Please also include a photo of the member if possible. In the next issue of the Journal , we will be including a special section on some of the important changes that are being made within MUFON. This will be a primer on the MUFON STAR Team, STOV Team, Research Teams, and the future of MUFON investiga- tions. By understanding where MUFON is headed, we hope that you will decide to join in one of these efforts to further MUFON’s mission and goals. MUFON is a scientific research organization. It is important that we go back to our roots and stress the scien- tific aspect of what we do. Ufology is filled with pseudoscientific claims, allegations, conspiracies and disinfor- mation. MUFON’s job is to sift the wheat from the chaff and to get to the heart of what is going on while using well established scientific protocols. The public looks to MUFON for rational explanations of what they are experiencing. We must approach our investigations, research and public education with a rational point of view. The ufological spectrum spans from the unquestioning believer on one end to the “unwilling to investigate” debunker on the other end. MUFON should be in the middle of the spectum neither blindly believing nor skeptically dismissing without doing our homework. Our common goal should be to solve the UFO mystery, not perpetuate it.
