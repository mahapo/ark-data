Turkish military pilots encounter UFO Esen Sekerkarar By Esen Sekerkarar On Aug. 7,2001, two military pilots of the Turkish Air Force were witnesses to a very unusual incident. At about 12:30 p.m. Instructor Pilot First Lt. Ilker Dincer and his student, Lt. Arda Gunyel, took off with a T-37 training aircraft from Squadron 122 in Izmir, Turkey's third largest city, for a training flight. As they were flying over Candarli Gulf at an altitude of 15,000 feet, they started making maneuvers of adjust- ment and engine stopping. Then First Lt. Dincer and his pupil encountered a UFO. After recovering from the shock, Dincer reported the situa- tion to the ground control and the Regional Military Centre near Kutahya. First Lt. Dincer re- ported to the operation center: \"We encounter an unusual situ- ation. There is an extremely bright object resembling a funnel or a pyramid with a leg flying at a very high speed.\" But the Centre's answer was, \"We detected your aircraft. But no other object around can be detected.\" Thereupon, First Lt. Dincer directed the aircraft towards the mysterious object. Ac- cording to his statement, the object did the same. The UFO approached the T-37's wings, and they started to fly together. Dincer reported, \"Object is approaching our wings. Now it's at the rear. I'll take it in the front by a maneuver. Object is now over us. This is literally dog- fighting with us.\" The UFO made maneuvers around the aircraft for about 15 minutes. An experienced pilot, Dincer responded to the maneuvers of the mysterious craft. The dangerous dogfight ended with the disappearance of the UFO at a fantastic speed. Here is the full radio talk of First Lt. Dincer and the Base: T-37: Position Candarli skies, we are facing an un- usual situation. Base: What is the problem? T-37: There is a very bright object resembling a fun- nel and a disk flying at a very high speed in 12 o'clock position. Base: Continue, what's its position? T-37: It is approaching me at a very high speed from straight ahead. Immediately detect this object on the ra- dars. 1 have never encountered such a thing. I suspect it is a UFO. Base: We detect a high activity of your craft. But no other object can be detected on the radar. About the author Ms. Sekerkarar, a graduate of Istanbul University, Tur- key, got involved with ufology in 1998 with the opening of the Sirius UFO Space Sciences Research Center (SUSSRC), where she served as vice-president. It is the first center for collecting and researching ufological data throughout Turkey, and has organized three international UFO symposiums. She is also one of the three founders of the International UFO Museum, which opened Jan. 18 in Istanbul. She spoke at the 2002 MUFON Symposium. T-37: We are turning the cursor to the object. Base: We cannot detect a second object other than you. T-37: The object is coming towards us. Base: Radar detect negative. T-37: Object is approaching our wings. Now it's at the rear. I'll take it in the front by a maneuver. Base: I repeat, radar detect negative. T-37: Object is now over us. This is literally dogfight- ing with us. Base: Continue T-37: Object suddenly disappeared. After returning to their base in Cigli [Izmir], the pilots reported the incident to their superiors. It was stated that there was much astonishment in the Air Force and that the investigation continued. Air Force's Press Release As this news was all over the front pages of the news- papers and on TV as breaking news, the Turkish Air Force had to make a press release where it was stated that the encountered object was a meteorology balloon! This statement was not taken seriously by the media itself, either. Also Meteorology Centre stated that there were no balloons over that route at the date. One other thing is that before training flights the route is always checked for air traffic. No need to say it is a law of nature that no meteorol- ogy balloon can dogfight with a jet at such high altitude and make such unconventional maneuvers. . However the Air Force did not make any further state- ments after the objections. The two pilots were not al- lowed to speak about the encounter, so they could not be reached at their base for any further details. The case was closed.

Disney, UFOs, and Disclosure By Grant Cameron W ard Kimball, one of the original Disney ani- mators, referred to by Walt Disney as one of the trusted \"Nine Old Men\" (supreme court of animation), died in Arcadia, CA, on July 8. He was 88. Kimball was famous for his ani- mated creation of the characters Jiminy Cricket, The Cheshire Cat, The March Hare, The Mad Hat- ter, and for redesigning Mickey Mouse in 1938. He j oined the Disney Studios in 1934, and rose up in the ranks to become a directing animator on such classics as \"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs,\" \"Pinocchio,\" \"Fantasia\" and \"Peter Pan.\" He directed Disney Oscar-winning shorts \"Toot, Whistle, Plunk and Boom\" in 1953 and \"It's Tough To Be a Bird\" in 1969. Unknown to many Disney watchers, Kimball was also a stu- dent of UFOs and outer space. He had a large collection of UFO books and magazines, according to Navy physicist Bruce Maccabee, who met with him in 1980. Maccabee had been to Kimball's house to recruit him as one of the 10 original board members for the Fund for UFO Research. Kimball accepted the position, although he really didn't become an active member of the board. In the mid-fifties Kimball worked with a soon to be famous scientific advisor by the name of Wemher von Braun to write and direct three key outer space docu- mentaries for the \"Disneyland\" television series. The three documentaries were \"Man in Space,\" \"Man and the Moon,\" and \"Mars and Beyond.\" Kimball referred to them as \"the creative high point of my career.\" According to Disney spokesman Howard E. Green, the three outer space documentaries are \"often credited with popularizing the concept of the government's space program during the 1950's.\" The first of these, the 1955 \"Man in Space,\" was so popular (viewed by over 42 million people) that, accord- ing to Kimball, President Eisenhower phoned Walt Disney from the White House looking for a copy of the production. When Disney asked Eisenhower why he wanted it, Eisenhower replied, \"Well, I'm going to show it to all those stove-shirt generals who don't believe we're going to be up there!\" Page 4 Ward Kimball It was Kimball, who at the July 1979 MUFON UFO symposium in California told of his interest in the subject of UFOs. Then to a stunned audience he related the story of how the American government had approached Walt Disney himself, prior to Sputnik, to make a UFO docu- mentary to help acclimatize the American population to the reality of extraterrestrials. Kimball stated in the speech that around 1955 or 1956 the USAF con- tacted Walt Disney. They asked him to cooperate on a documentary about UFOs. As a part of the deal, the USAF offered to supply actual UFO footage, which Disney would be allowed to use in his film. According to Kimball's account, Disney went along with the USAF plan, which was not that unusual. The use of Walt Disney cartoons, after all, had been suggested by the 1953 CIA Robertson UFO panel as part of a public-education program involving the mass media to \"strip the UFO phenomenon of its spe- cial status and eliminate the aura of mystery, it has acquired.\" 1 The discussions between the CIA people and Disney may actu- ally have taken place, because in August 1955, Frederick C. Durant III, who was a member of the Robertson CIA panel, showed Walt Kimball's documentary \"Man in Space\" during the Sixth Congress of the International As- tronomical Federation in Copenhagen. 2 Prior to the request for a UFO documentary by the defense department, Disney had shown a capacity to co- operate with the government. His studio produced 80 armed forces shorts during WW II. Films such as \"Alice in Wonderland\" (1951) and \"Peter Pan\" (1953) were put on hold while the Disney staff produced the numerous animated films, plus 1,200 insignia designs for military units. In one year, during the war, Disney turned out over four hundred thousand feet of government films. 3 \"Victory through air power\" The films ranged from one on venereal disease to one of the most popular, which was the film \"Victory through Air Power.\" It is the film which British Prime Minister Winston Churchill and Roosevelt watched together just prior to the invasion of Europe. Roosevelt was \"excited by the way Disney's aircraft masterfully wiped ships off the seas,\" so it was \"run again the next day, and FDR MUFON UFO Journal September 2002"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"invited the Joint Staff to have a look at it.\" Disney had represented the United States government on a good-will tour of Chile, Argentina, Columbia, Brazil, and Bolivia, and he had allowed the United States Army to station a 700-man anti-aircraft unit at his Los Angeles studio early in the war. Disney was also, according to a Dec. 16, 1954, FBI document, made a SAC Contact for the FBI, which el- evated him from his former position as an informant for the agency. Now he was able to gather information from other FBI informants. The confidential internal FBI memo read, \"Because of Mr. Disney's position as the foremost producer of cartoon files in the motion picture industry, and his prominence and wide acquaintanceship in film production matters, it is believed that he can be of valu- able assistance to this office ...\" What would an alien look like? Once Walt Disney had finished his meetings with the USAF, he began to work on the requested UFO docu- mentary for the public. He asked his animators to think up what an alien would look like. Meanwhile, he waited for the Air Force to deliver on the promised film. After some period of time the Air Force re-contacted Disney and told him the film offer had to be withdrawn. There would be no UFO footage as promised. Kimball told researcher Stanton Friedman that once he found out there would be no delivery of UFO film, he personally spoke with an Air Force Colonel who told him \"there in- deed was plenty of UFO footage, but that neither Ward, nor anyone else, was going to get access to it.\" 4 This caused a temporary halt to Disney's UFO docu- mentary project. As one account by Bruce Maccabee described it, \"Disney cancelled the project, but by this time a lot of animated film of 'creatures' had been com- pleted by his artists. So Disney went ahead and made a short 'documentary' anyway, featuring Jonathan Winters impersonating various 'characters' associated with typical UFO lore. \"I specifically recall Mr. Winters as an old lady/grand- mother who saw a UFO and reported it... then he por- trayed the Air Force officer who investigated the sightings and offered explanations. He also portrayed a little boy in a room who had a telescope looking up at the stars and, to the little boy's amazement, an alien came through the telescope into his room (I think I've got this right). Of course the boy's father didn't believe that story.\" 5 The UFO documentary was never shown in public, but Kimball did show the 15-20 minute piece at the 1979 MUFON Symposium. The documentary, however, did not contain any of the dramatic UFO footage everyone had been anticipating. Other attempts to \"spill the beans\" What is important to note about this Kimball story, re- lating the attempt by the United States government to \"spill the beans,\" is that it was not the only time such an incident had occurred. People associated with the United States government have been approaching people inside the UFO community with similar UFO film offers for decades. A close look at these \"approaches\" shows some About the author Grant Cameron became involved in Ufology in May 1975 with a sighting of an object during the Carman Manitoba UFO flap. Over the next 18 months he had many other sightings of objects in the area. He spent count- less days in the area photographing the objects and inter- viewing hundreds of witnesses who were involved. After composing a manuscript about the flap, he moved on to research the work of the late Wilbert B. Smith, who headed up the Canadian government flying saucer inves- tigation known as Project Magnet, which ran from 1950 to 1954. During two decades of work on Smith, Cameron was able to collect most of Smith's files and material writ- ten about Smith, as well as interviewing most of the asso- ciates around Smith who worked on the flying saucer in- vestigation. Years of Smith research led to the discovery of former Perm State University president Dr. Eric Walker, who was identified by Dr. Robert Sarbacher as a key person inside the UFO cover-up. Cameron teamed up with T. Scott Grain to write a book titled UFOs, MJ-12, and the Gov- ernment which summed up their three years of research on Dr. Walker. In the past few years Cameron has turned his research interests to the involvement and actions of the presidents of the United States in the UFO problem. He has made 10 trips to the National Archives and various presidential archives looking for presidential UFO material. Many of his findings have been written up on The Presidents Website www.presidentialufo.com. At present Cameron is working on producing mono- graphs for Walker, Smith, the Presidential involvement in psychic phenomena, and a monograph looking at a pos- sible disclosure pattern to try and explain many of the actions of the American government related to UFOs during the past 50 years. sort of strange and desperate attempt to get out a mes- sage to the American population. At exactly the same time as Kimball was producing his space documentaries, and Disney was fielding offers from the USAF to do a UFO documentary, the USAF was busy doing what they could do to manage another UFO documentary being produced by Clarence Greene and Russell Rouse. Prepared for controversy The 92-minute documentary titled \"UFO\" was even- tually released in May, 1956. It was a film that Air Force officials thought might bring a storm of controversy, new sightings, and flying saucer hysteria. As pointed out by author David Jacobs in his book UFO Controversy in America, the Air Force set up a contingency plan to counteract the feared fallout from the documentary. The new Project Blue Book Director and \"zealous UFO de- bunker,\" Captain George T. Gregory, took the necessary steps to deal with the UFO documentary. \"Gregory kept a file of all the movie's reviews, notifi- cations, and advertisements, carefully underlining every September 2002 MUFON UFO Journal PageS"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"statement that might cause problems for the Air Force or generate interest in UFOs. From Richard Dyer McCann's review in the Christian Science Monitor, Gregory singled out the statement, 'It will almost certainly stir up a storm of public controversy,' and added the marginal note, 'This is some- thing that neither PIO (Office of Public Information) or ATIC would like to undergo again!' \"ATIC asked (Dr. J. Allen) Hynek (then AF Chief UFO Consultant) and Air Force officers to review the film before its release, and asked photo ex- perts to compare copies of the Mariana and Newhouse films with the excerpts shown in the movie. ATIC Chief Sci- entist A. Francis Arcier met with agency officials to discuss the prepa- ration of a case file giving the official Air Force explanation for every sight- ing portrayed in the film.\" More importantly, the Air Force had not only prepared for the fallout from the film, they had actively par- ticipated in the development of the Fournei. Chop, and Ruppelt Review \"UFO\" Script. documentary. Three key former Blue Book members- Albert M. Chop, Maj. Dewey J.Fournet, and Capt. Ed- ward Ruppelt-provided technical assistance to Greene and Rouse. The three Air Force men had many meeting with the producers.  : Greene told researcher Robert Barrow: \"Together we went into a lengthy and exhaustive study of reports, vari- ous documents and affidavits of UFO sightings and re- ports from radar experts which, with some heretofore top secret motion pictures, in color, of flying saucers, form the basis of the film.\" Most importantly Greene and Rouse obtained two key UFO films that had just been declassified for \"UFO.\" The two films, both showing daytime UFOs in flight, were, the Great Falls, Montana, film which showed two objects, and the Tremonton, Utah, film which showed 12 objects. The films had been analyzed and presented to the CIA Robertson UFO Panel in January, 1953, as the best pho- tographic evidence held by the USAF related to UFOs. Following their appearance at the Robertson panel the Air Force chose to keep the two films classified. The Utah film was actually declassified quietly by ATIC just before \"UFO\" was finished. Declassified for the documentary? Were the two films declassified for the UFO docu- mentary? Were these all or part of the UFO footage that had been shown to Walt Disney? The timing was ideal, and at least Ruppelt and Foumet were involved in the analysis of at least the Utah film. An even more direct and dramatic encounter between the Air Force and a team of documentary producers OC L curred in 1972-73. It was then that former USAF Project Blue Book spokesman Col. William Coleman and former ATIC Commander Col. George Weinbrenner made an offer at the Pentagon of \"800 feet of film. . .as well as several thousand feet of additional material\" related to UFOs. The offer was made to documentary film producers Robert Emenegger and Allan Sandier. The two men were told that they would be allowed to use the UFO footage in a special film project they had been asked to join. Other than the fact that neither man had to sign in at the Pen- tagon, the whole documentary nego- tiation was handled like an ordinary film deal, according to Emenegger. There were no mysterious figures and calls in the middle of the night as had happened with researchers like Bill Moore. The talks to go over the details of the documentary were held in places like Col. William Coleman's Pentagon office. Emenegger described some of the incredible events that oc- curred as the officially sanctioned De- fense Department film was being planned: \"As a matter of fact, you know, one of our agreements was to go over the script at the Penta- gon, and if there was any question about anything they had the right to ask about it. Strangely enough, no one even questioned the thing about the landing at Holloman Air Force Base. It was like, 'Well, OK'... I just couldn't believe it (Emenegger and Sandier began as UFO disbelievers), but said, 'Oh, Well-I'll go along with it.' One conversation led to another. Everyone couldn't have been more open about what we were doing. Anyone along the line could have questioned it, which I expected. They could have said, 'What the hell are you guys talking about?' This included Gen. George Weinbrenner, if you recall.\" Dramatic footage of landed UFO The main film promised to the two men was dramatic footage of an encounter between the occupants of a landed UFO and officials at Holloman Air Force Base. It im- pressed Emenegger, who described what he saw in 1988: \"What I saw and heard was enough to convince me that the phenomenon of UFOs is real-very real.\" 6 The project was described to the two producers as a documentary on a secret government project. When the two men discovered that the topic of the secret project would be UFOs, they were surprised because \"they had assumed that the matter had been resolved with the clo- sure of Project Blue Book in 1969.\" The documentary was to be sponsored by the Depart- ment of Defense in a claimed attempt to do a public rela- tions turnaround, which they claimed was needed because of the Vietnam War. At least that is the story Emenegger and Sandier were told by Col. Bill Coleman. A number of different subjects were proposed for the defense docu- mentaries (such as 3-D holography and laser develop- ment), but no other subject other than UFOs was ever Page 6 MUFON UFO Journal September 2002"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"brought up. The two documentary producers were told that the government was now ready to release all the facts about the alien presence on earth. They were shown and told about evidence that they could use for their tell- all documentary. This evidence included: * Photographs and films of UFOs. * Pictures of grey-skinned alien beings. * A 16mm movie film of an alien in the company of an Air Force officer. The two men were told that this alien had survived a 1949 crash, and that it had been kept at a safe house in Los Alamos until its death in 1952. 7 4 800 feet of film showing an encounter between three aliens and Holloman Air Base officials during a landing that had reportedly occurred there in May, 1971. 8 Several thousand feet of additional material was also promised. * Photos of UFOs taken by astronauts, which NASA had formally denied the existence of. As the documentary neared completion, the two pro- ducers waited for the promised dramatic alien landing footage taken at Holloman AFB. Col. Coleman, who had first made the offer to provide it in 1972, however, with- drew the film offer. According to what Emenegger told researcher Tim Good, Coleman had declared, \"The tim- ing was politically inappropriate, due to the Watergate scandal.\" 9 Documentary released The Emenegger/Sandler documentary, \"UFOS, Past, Present, and Future\" was released by Sandier Films in 1974. Lacking the actual UFO footage, the documentary was forced to use standard animation, background film taken at Holloman, and \"elaborate drawing of the so-called aliens.\" At least that is what the producers thought when they first ran the film. Later, indications arose that indicated 12 seconds of the actual Holloman landing might have been slipped in (for unknown reasons) as part of the \"training film\" material the defense department provided for the documentary. As an interesting footnote to the Disney story, Emenegger reported that he and Sandier had also talked with the Disney people during the time period they were working on their UFO documentary. The people who they spoke to at the Disney studios \"seemed to be involved and interested, but did not have any particularly startling data.\" In 1983, the United States government made yet an- other offer of dramatic UFO film for a UFO documen- tary. This new offer was made to documentary film pro- ducer Linda Moulton Howe and HBO. They were ap- proached and offered the same Holloman landing film, along with a film of the live alien that supposedly had lived in a Los Alamos safe house from 1949-1952. New evidence? The events that led to the offer .came while Howe was preparing to make a UFO documentary for HBO. Through a second researcher, who had heard about the new evi- dence, Howe was brought onto the Kirkland Air Force Base in Albuquerque. There, Richard Doty, an Air Force Office of Special Investigations special agent, made her the new film offer. Doty told Howe that \"higher-ups\" were willing to release special confirming UFO footage for her documentary. Howe described the film offer made to her: \"The government intended to release to me several thousand feet of color and black and white film taken between 1947 and 1964 showing crashed UFO discs and extraterrestrial bodies in historic footage to be included in the HBO documentary supported with official govern- ment confirmation.\" 10 Film not released As with Kimball and the Emenegger/Sandler team, the promised film was never released to Howe. Despite Dory's claim that the government had authorized the release of film showing crashed saucers and alien bodies for use in the HBO documentary, it never materialized. Doty and others at the base told Howe that this was due to \"politi- cal delays.\" When the alleged historical film footage didn't materialize, HBO canceled the documentary, and Howe was forced to move on to other projects. In 1985, yet another offer of historic UFO footage was made, once again to Robert Emenegger. Col. William Coleman, now retired from the Air Force Public Rela- tions Office and living in Florida, indicated the time was again right. The government might again be willing to re- lease key footage confirming the extraterrestrial presence on earth. Suggestions were even made that Senator Barry Goldwater, and former President Jimmy Carter \"would help\" obtain the release of the promised film. One of the conditions tied to the release, however, was that prominent UFO researchers Jacques Vallee and J. Allen Hynek had to get involved in the film project. The reason given for this was that a key to getting the govern- ment to release the information hinged on the film being \"professional enough and interesting enough to reopen the whole subject before the American people.\" By the time Hynek had been contacted by Col. Coleman in 1985 to get involved in the newest UFO film disclosure, Hynek was already familiar with the Holloman and other UFO films that would be offered to Vallee and himself. That is because Brian and Tina Choate, who were in large part responsible for bringing Hynek to Arizona, had already seen the UFO footage-including the 1971 Holloman Air Force Base alien landing footage. They were shown UFO footage and photos at Norton Air Force Base's Defense Audiovisual Agency (DAVA) in the early 1980s by a Gen. Glenn E. Miller, who asked them if they would like to check out a copy of the Holloman footage. They were expected to then pass on the word of what they had seen to Dr. Hynek. \"Miller wanted to get the word out.\" Generals were contactees? Gen. Miller, a man with two doctorate degrees, worked at DAVA along with his boss Gen. Robert Scott, the DAVA Director. Surprisingly, both generals were, accord- ing to Jacques Vallee, \"outright contactees.\" Because the Choates were \"steeped heavily in contactee lore,\" it is believed Miller allowed them to see the Holloman film even though they were not prominent in the UFO community. In 1985, Emenegger had seen September 2002 MUFON UFO Journal Page?"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"enough to lead him to believe that dramatic UFO infor- mation and film footage was once again about to be re- leased. That is because he too was dealing with Gen. Scott and Gen. Miller at Norton. He spoke of this new contact to get him to'do another UFO documentary: \"During the Reagan administration I met with Gen. Bob Scott and Gen. Glenn Miller... they wanted another program like we had done, and we spent a lot of time discussing it. Bob Scott was a Reagan appointee ... He had a Glen E. Miller retired general as his aide, or second in command. We spent a lot of discussion. There was a lot of stuff in the vault that he wanted to get out. I even had Gen. Miller come to our house to meet Hynek and his group to take them out to Norton so they could look around .. . Miller was, interestingly enough, head of one of the studios in Hollywood-one of the old ones. He got Reagan his first contract. So there were these strange connections. I met with Miller and Scott like at Denny's restaurant. It was like 'Meet at Denny's and we will discuss this.'\" Vallee, on the other hand, was \"negative and skepti- cal\" about the offer of the UFO footage being promised by the two generals. He felt that if the government wanted to release the information they could simply go to some- one like the national Academy of Sciences and announce the discovery of the alien presence. Both Vallee and Hynek felt the Air Force was again playing games and were trying to use them to deliberately mislead the public. Between themselves, they concluded that they could not support Emenegger's plan to pursue a documentary, but \"if there was any chance of uncovering genuine evidence\" they would pursue it \"behind 1 the scenes.\"  ' Hynek and Vallee weren't buying Hynek and Vallee did follow up on some interviews at Norton Air Force Base, where two \"contactee\" generals assured them they could produce the UFO footage. The two researchers, however, weren't buying, and the UFO film offer was finally withdrawn. In the late eighties, 1 the government was again busy making disclosure promises. This time the offers included the offer of an interview with the \"keeper\" of the live alien that had been held at Los Alamos, or access to a 16mm film that had been taken of the alien while he was still living. The man who had been the \"keeper\" had been a captain in the early fifties when he lived with the cap- tured alien. He was by one account now a colonel, near death, .and prepared to talk. Those presented with the interview offer were documentary film producer Linda Howe and author Bill Moore. A chance to view an alien Emenegger was not offered a film interview with the alien. Through Paul Shartle he was offered an actual chance to go to New Mexico and see the alien (EBE-3) that was now a guest of the government. Prominent au- thor Whitley Strieber was made the offer of publicizing a 16mm film that had been taken of the alien, along with other bizarre tales. Whitley described his government encounter this way: \"I had some personal experience with them. I was approached by a retired officer from the Air Force Of- fice of Special Investigations with all kinds of stories, how the government had taken 16mm film of an alien that they had done an operation on in 1952 to enable it to talk through otherwise atrophied vocal cords. It struck me as ... I wouldn't have written it,as fiction because it was ridicu- lous. They tried to make me believe that aliens had some- thing to do with Jesus Christ and all sorts of ridiculous things which if I had gone out into the public with would have make me look like a fool.\" Offer withdrawn In most of the cases involving the live alien footage and the interview with the \"keeper,\" there was one delay after another. Finally, like the offer of UFO films made to other researchers in the seventies and early eighties, the offer was eventually withdrawn. The final twist in this bizarre disclosure saga brings us back to the Disney animator Ward Kimball. A prominent British photographer by the name of Don Maloney re- ported in 1995 that in 1972 he had been in the United States and was having dinner with the head of the Disney Studios, and four of the nine original Disney animators. Ward Kimball was one of the four at the table. While this dinner was going on, Maloney reported that he was introduced to another man, identified in one ac- count as a \"well-known Disney employee.\" The man of- fered to show Maloney some unusual film footage at his house. When Maloney saw it he described it as \"old foot- age of UFOs,\" and \"two beings that he was told were aliens.\" UFO investigator Georgina Bruni interviewed Mike Maloney about his early 1970s encounter at Disney. She described what Maloney told her about the aliens he had been shown on the film: \"One, which appeared to be dead, was laid out on a table-or slab; the other was clearly alive and moving around on the floor. He was given no information .as to the source of the footage, which he was told was 'top se- cret,' but he was in no doubt that it was a genuine piece of old film. Mike described it as being similar to the alien autopsy footage that had been shown on television. (The Santilli \"Alien Autopsy\" film.) At no time did he say it was the same, just similar. Of the footage he personally viewed, he said: 'If the film that I saw was a fake, it was a brilliant fake.\"\" 1 Was it Kimball? Was the \"well-known\" employee Kimball, or was there a second \"well-known\" Disney employee who was also a UFO buff? Was the Kimball Disney story told by Kimball in 1979 just a cover for a film that the Disney people had actually gotten from the government? Maloney has not yet released the name of the man who showed him the film. If it was Kimball who showed the alien film in his house, then the government now knows where that miss- ing UFO film went. If it wasn't Kimball who showed Maloney the conclu- sive E.T. footage, then Ward Kimball, like many UFO researchers before him, had spent many decades of his life gathering strong evidence of the E.T. presence, and PageS MUFON UFO Journal September 2002"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"died before he could hear the government confirm his suspicions.

They had vertical slit eyes like a cat and had a headpiece that resembled \"rows of rope-like design.\" They had a large nose, or some type of breathing device.

The Balaskas discovery not only backs up the con- tents of what was found in the Top Secret document de- classified by the Canadian government in 1979, it adds two new pages to the three that researchers were al- ready aware of. Wilbert Smith, Senior Radio Engineer in the Canadian Department of Transport, wrote the original Top Secret memo to his superiors in November, 1952. The memo was the beginning of the Canadian government's official program to investigate flying saucers. Wilbert Smith headed up that investigation from December 1950 to August 1954. The existence of the Top Secret draft in the Wilbert Smith UFO files is part of the reason that the Canadian government was forced to declassify the Top Secret memo held in their files. Wilbert Smith left the draft in the files to give future researchers the truth of what had actually happened in the early days of government investigation into flying sau- cers. Dying of cancer, Smith made arrangement with his wife to hide the files so they would survive his death. \"They will be coming to recover them,\" he told his wife Murl. As Smith predicted, the Canadians, Americans, and Soviets approached Mrs. Smith, requesting the files for research purposes. Mrs. Smith told all callers she no longer had the files. After a number of break-ins that might have been linked to the search for the files, they were passed on to Arthur Bray, a local Ottawa researcher, who held them quietly for over two decades. Bray was aware of the Top Secret memo draft, but was unable to say anything because the copy in the Smith files was still marked Top Secret. Bray held a Navy se- curity clearance and was forced to remain quiet. Bray, aware of what was in the files, did however lead the charge to force the government to release all the \"Project Magnet\" files held by the government. He wrote letters to government ministers and officials telling them where the files would be found. The \"Project Magnet\" Top Secret memo is the key document in the large Smith collection of UFO material, now stored in the archives at the University of Ottawa. In the memo, Smith outlined five key items about fly- ing saucers that he had discovered while in discussions with top U.S. officials working on the flying saucer prob- lem. These were: 1) The matter is the most highly classified subject in the United States Government, rating higher than even the H-bomb.

The two newly discovered pages of the November 1952 memo are titled \"Project Magnet\" and are classified in the draft as \"Secret.\" The new pages read as follows: Purpose This project is for the purpose of studying magnetic phenomena, particularly those phenomena resulting from unusual boundary conditions in the basic electromagnetic field. There is reason to believe their discovery will open up a new and useful technology. Organization The initial organization shall be as small as practical and composed of personnel who are used to working to- gether, including so far as possible a variety of research abilities. Laboratory facilities are to be drawn from exist- ing facilities so far as possible. Overall responsibility for the project shall rest with the engineer-in-charge, who shall delegate such responsibil- ity to subordinates as may be required to carry out the project. Program The initial program shall include the following avenues of investigations, to which others may be added from time top time as may appear expedient. 1. Theoretical study of electromagnetic radiation as- suming boundary conditions different from those upon which the conventional theory was developed. 2. Laboratory study of mechanical forces associated with electron drift and electric currents in metallic masses. 3. Theoretical and laboratory study of magnetic do- main resonance conditions in magnetic materials. 4. Investigation of the propagation of magnetic wave motion in magnetic materials. 5. Investigate the possibility of producing, in effect, a \"sink\" in a magnetic field. 6. Investigate the possibility of producing, in effect, single isolated magnetic poles. 7. Investigate the effects of a magnetic field on a ro- tating curviplaner metallic object. Coordination Full coordination is to be maintained, within security regulations, with other groups working on a parallel or associated problems. Project reports will be available on a classified basis to suitably accredited groups of indi- viduals. Security As in the case with most fields of research, it is im- possible to assess the results in advance, which might be obtained through this project. However, there exist cer- tain suspicions that the lesser-known and little explored aspects of magnetism may hold the key to a new and significant technology. Consequently, it is intended to clas- sify this work in it entirety until such time as it can be assessed for its impact on our civilization.

Because of the controversial nature of this material and the fear of scientists that they may suffer career dam- age if they work on it, he leaves behind him a significant void. Dr. Roger Leir, noted implant researcher and author, says, \"Bill became a good friend and colleague of mine. He worked on several different portions of the implant study. Without him we would not have gotten as far as we did. His loss will be felt deeply by many. The labora- tory he was connected with will now be closed to all of us who are researching in this field. This is a sad day in- deed.\" Mallow was the first scientist to explore these objects with an open mind, and he made a number of valuable discoveries about them. James Lankford, the Materials Engineering Director of the Southwest Research Institute where Mallow had been employed since 1954, said of him, \"Bill Mallow is surely the greatest inventor and one of the greatest scien- tists in the history of the institute.\" He held 38 U.S. pat- ents. Although the institute took a dim view of his research into unusual objects, Mallow continued to conduct it de- spite their objections, paying for the research himself. As well as being a notable scientist, Mallow was a musician, a singer, and a poet. 2002 Symposium Proceedings The MUFON 2002 International UFO Sym- posium Proceedings book is now available from MUFON Headquarters for $25 + $2.50 p&h (U.S.).

Alarms sounded and planes took to the skies. Banner headlines shouted the event across the land. The public was mystified, and the event has withstood firm explanation to this day. Now a half century later, on the 50th anniversary of that legendary UFO \"invasion\" of the nation's capital, our collective cage has apparently been rattled by yet an- other mysterious occurrence. Around 1 o'clock in the morning of Friday, July 26, 2002, a pair of Air Force F-16 jets were scrambled from Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland to investigate an unidentified object tracked by NORAD radar systems. The unidentified radar target was apparently moving toward the Washington, D.C., vicinity, approaching the Temporary Flight Restriction Area designated after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. According to Maj. Mike Snyder, Command Spokes- man for both NORAD and The U.S. Space Command, this particular track was considered \"of interest.\" Maj. Snyder noted that \"its radar signature, speed, and elevation fit the criteria of a small private aircraft. It was viewed as a reasonable security precaution to ascertain the intentions of the track and implement a graduated re- sponse.\" He said that in extreme circumstances, such a response may include use of lethal force. NORAD alerted the 113th Air National Guard wing of Andrews Air Force Base to investigate the unidentified radar target as it approached the most sensitive area of the country. Men took to action, and jets were scrambled. Fueling this already tense situation with a healthy dose of mystery, the radar target \"faded\" from NORAD de- tection systems. And so it goes-the pilots found nothing and saw noth- ing, so they returned home to a happy ending. Or that's what the official line is. Meanwhile, all hell broke loose in nearby Waldorf, MD, as frightened residents took to the streets in droves amidst an aerial explosion of noise and tumultuous commotion. According to a report from the Washington Post news- paper, Renny Rogers rushed out under the din of aircraft noise to see the source of the mayhem and was \"floored\" by the spectacle. \"It was this object, this light blue object, traveling at a phenomenal rate of speed, followed by this Air Force jet... right behind it, chasing it,\" Rogers said to reporters. \"I told my neighbor, 'I think those jets are chasing a UFO.'\" Others also saw the bedlam, and the switchboards of talk radio station WTOP in Washington, D.C., lit up with queries of concern. Some described a blue light, some thought it was orange or white. Some said it had soft edges. Some said it made no noise. To some, it appeared that military jets were in pursuit. A July 26, 2002, newscast on the FOX News network told of numerous eyewitness claims that the unusual light had been chased by military jets. One witness was quoted as saying the jets were right on its tail. \"As the thing would move, a jet was right behind it...\" But Maj. Snyder is doubtful of the observational cogni- zance of the citizenry of Waldorf, MD. \"People can see what they want to see...\" he said. \"What these people reported could have been exhaust from the jet itself, depending on whether or not the pilot was on or off afterburners. We don't think it was a UFO.\" However, he could not explain the exact nature of NORAD's unidentified radar track. \"In this situation we found nothing at all,\" the Com- mand Spokesman said. \"The radar return may have been caused by a small plane flying low, and sometimes that will cause them to drop on or off the radar.\" When asked about the radar target's peculiar method of departure by \"fading\" from the radar screens, Maj. Snyder said, \"I don't have any info on this,.but it's not uncommon for either routine or unidentified radar returns to fade. Sometimes a plane will simply come down.and land on a small airport in the area or on a grassy strip.\" The Command Spokesman was then asked if he could inform of the location, speed, and altitude the object was last observed, and he said: \"I cannot get into this with any specificity. NORAD is absolutely not concerned about this situation. We posture our forces according to the threat, and at no time did this incident involve any threat to our country.\" The Major also does not think that President Bush was awakened by the unusual episode and has no reason to believe that the Secret Service was cautioned. \"It was an innocuous happening,\" he remarked. Yet while Maj. Snyder and NORAD think this \"innocu- ous happening\" has no relevance to the security of our nation's capital, his hypothesis regarding the nature of the unidentified radar track argues just the opposite. Suppose this was a small private plane that somehow eluded the F-16 jets scrambled to intercept it., Wouldn't that plane and its grassy \"landing strip\" hideaway some- where near the flight restriction zone around Washington, D.C., pose a security concern if manned by hostile op- eratives? And the factual reality of UFOs just might be another little security concern. But when it's all said and done we'll probably have another unsolved mystery on our hands. And in time the mystery will slip away into that big black hole where all the \"unresolved mysteries\" are collectively forgotten.

By Jim Deardorff deardorj@proaxis.com A fter 55 years of continued UFO reports indi- /\\ eating a wide range of UFO/alien behavior, the -Z \\>question must arise as to whether or not the UFO occupants, or aliens, are carrying out some sort of strategy directed at us. And if so, what kind of strategy? According to Elaine Douglass, for example, it is evi- dent they are participating in maintaining the UFO coverup. That this is the case follows from the fact that never, in hundreds of thousands of sightings and large numbers of abductions, have they stayed around long enough for the news media of the developed world to converge upon the scene, and never have they left sufficient evidence be- hind to satisfy scientists who value their professional repu- tations. That this could be the result of random behavior seems entirely implausible, given the reality of the UFO phe- nomenon. This then must be one element of an alien strat- egy. A prime factum is the oft-noted feature that during this extended period of time, and during past millennia as well, they have not wiped us out, enslaved us, or taken over the planet despite in all probability possessing the capability of doing so. From this it is usually concluded that the aliens involved are non-hostile, at least to society as a whole. This lets us know that their strategy does not entail out- right hostility. Now, many of us are aware from science fiction, in particular Star Trek, that advanced, exploring ETs (in that case, us) may obey a \"prime directive\" in regards to less advanced alien beings of other planets. The intent of the directive is that the advanced beings not disrupt the de- veloping civilization of the lesser advanced beings who are not yet aware of life outside their planet. Interestingly, papers have appeared in the peer-re- viewed scientific literature that incorporate this thought. The researchers allow that exploration, rather than exploitive colonization, could be a likely behavior of ad- vanced aliens, who may be treating us as if in a zoo, a nursery, or carrying out a quarantine or embargo against Earth until we are better prepared for contact. This theme has, for example, been accepted as a pos- sibility by Newman & Sagan, who referred to such ethi- cal guidelines as a Codex Galactica. They also wrote, \"Some subset of moderately advanced civilizations may be engaged in the exploration and colonization of other planetary systems; however, their mere existence makes it highly likely that their intentions are benign and their sensitivities at our level of technological adolescence deli- cate.\" However, a total embargo or hands-off strategy of Earth as part of an alien strategy would be self-defeating, in that when the time came when overt alien contact could no longer be delayed or prevented, the shock of sudden confrontation with a superior civilization would still be devastating to our society. Thus a \"leaky embargo\" strat- egy has been proposed. The UFO phenomenon consti- tutes the \"leak in the embargo,\" serving the purpose of conditioning society for eventual alien contact. This conditioning appears to be a prolonged educational process directed mainly towards those who are inquisi- tive and open to the possibility of an alien presence. It is then left up to the latter, plus the eyewitnesses themselves, who are typically found to be one person in 12 or 15, to try to persuade the rest of society of the reality of the UFO/alien presence. UFO sightings not only enlighten those who can ac- cept it, but provide them with significant information as to the aliens' level of technology-the capability of their craft to withstand tremendous accelerations, hover without making noise, travel at large supersonic speeds without producing sonic booms, disappear suddenly or become invisible, change shape, etc. The educational aspect Encounters with the aliens themselves have further educated us on their psychic abilities, communication via some form of mental telepathy, ability to block out memo- ries or provide screen memories within their abductees' minds, etc. By comparison, another purpose of the strat- egy, then, is evidently to cause us to recognize our own lowly place within the hierarchy of intelligent life forms in the cosmos. Most interesting is that even the aliens who carry out the abductions and animal mutilations, plus those who engage in less traumatic contacts, abide by the same stra- tegic guideline as followed by the aliens who provide \"or- dinary\" UFO sightings: they do not leave sufficient evi- dence behind that would force unwilling skeptics to be- lieve what is unthinkable to them. If this were not true, science would have caught on to the reality of the UFO phenomenon, including abductions, years ago. Hence, the aliens engaged in the abduction phenom- enon and animal mutilations cannot be considered totally independent of whichever alien group may be in charge of overseeing the strategy by which they all abide. It may be noticed that although these deductions indi- cate that the aliens involved can wield great power and advanced technology, they no longer need be treated as gods/goddesses, now that science and astronomy have carried us to the point where we can appreciate the like- lihood of the aliens' extraterrestrial origins and how their advanced capabilities should seem like magic to us. The fact that the aliens in charge have not protected us from our own follies and wars has not prevented trau- matic abductions from occurring-and have sometimes caused physical ailments in close-encounter witnesses- should further deter us from calling them gods or equat- Page 12 MUFON UFO Journal September 2002"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"ing them with true God, the Universal Consciousness (as- suming such exists). On the other hand, the counterbal- ancing benign or favorable aspects of the UFO phenom- enon as discussed above, which include healings of some abductees' and witnesses' physical problems, and impart- ing an increased psychic and spiritual awareness to oth- ers, suggest we should follow a middle path regarding alien ethical levels, treating them as neither angels nor demons. Though it may be more speculative, I therefore view this aspect-considering them on the whole as neither gods nor evil enemies, but entities rather like us except for their great headstart over us-as another element of the strat- egy the aliens in charge wish to put across to us. This, along with the variety of reported alien types and behaviors, suggests that we will need to consider each future alien encounter on its own merits, as common sense would dictate, while keeping in mind what the UFO phe- nomenon of the past several decades has taught us. Be- cause of the variety of alien types, I have frequently re- ferred to \"aliens in charge\" in connection with implemen- tation of the alien strategy. Other aspects of the strategy A disproportionate number of UFO sightings have oc- curred at nuclear missile silos and over nuclear power plants, and in the former case, nuclear missiles have even been remotely disarmed by the UFO. This strongly sug- gests that another element of the alien strategy is to dis- courage the use of nuclear weapons and nuclear power as well. A key topic that aliens communicate to their UFO experiencers is the grave danger of Earth and its environ- ment becoming unlivable through human destructiveness, carelessness, hatred, and greed. Emphasis of this con- cern then appears to be another facet of the alien strat- egy, probably because it is indeed of paramount impor- tance. On a less pessimistic note, their concern that we mend our ways suggests that they believe the future is not a fixed inevitability. This in turn suggests that the aliens, for the most part at least, are not time travelers from Earth's own future, tampering with a history assumed to be fluid and changeable. As mentioned at the beginning, an important part of the strategy is that the aliens maintain the UFO coverup at the same time as they covertly disclose their presence to selected witnesses and experiencers. There are a vari- ety of means by which they can accomplish this. They can purposely locate and time many of their UFO sightings to occur within an hour or two of a scientifically explain- able event, such as a bright meteorite, an earthquake, a volcanic eruption, or reentry of satellite debris. Then, although most witnesses will be astounded by the remarkable, non-explainable aspects of their sighting, non-witnesses may ignore these features of a UFO re- port if they wish and assume the event was the nearby scientifically explainable one, which it in some way re- sembled. Also, the aliens may exhibit a UFO craft that in some ways resembles a man-made or natural object, such as an airplane, helicopter, large balloon or even a cloud. The eyewitnesses will notice the eerie differences, such as not giving off any sound, not having wings or not using \"navigational\" lights of proper placement and color, in the case of aircraft, and not moving with the wind like any balloon or cloud does; however, the non-witnesses who read of the report may ignore such details and assume the witnesses were mistaken. The aliens may also communicate some disinformation, contradictory thoughts, or silly science to their abductees and contactees, who, when they report it, can get ac- cused by scientists of having invented their stories, and be ridiculed. The aliens' \"magical\" technology and ap- parent intelligence thus permits them to stay several jumps ahead of our scientists and ufologists alike, though at the personal expense of some UFO experiencers. Future outlook It may be that the aliens are patiently waiting for us to realize these facets of their strategy, which may seem so obvious in hindsight, and are waiting for us to convince our fellow man, especially those in position of authority, before making their first overt contact with humanity. The alternative scenario is that the aliens will make their presence known worldwide soon after some devas- tating global disasters, either natural or of mankind's mak- ing, have caused our civilization to collapse, in which case they need no longer fear that it would be their own overt presence that would produce the same reaction. It is true that we cannot know all, or even much, of what's in the minds of the aliens who are involved in the UFO phenomenon. However, this should not deter us from making logical sense out of the information they have chosen to impart to us during the past 55 years of UFO sightings and encounters. Having a handle on what the alien behavior is all about, and their implementation of a consistent though complex strategy, should help to make the UFO topic less unpalat- able to professional scientists, who don't like to study what doesn't make sense to them, and who are the linchpins in the maintenance of the UFO coverup.

Naperville crop circle appears to be a hoax A cron circle in a field of sovbeans iust off Diehl Road The onlv overall measurement i A crop circle in a field of soybeans just off Diehl Road in Naperville, IL, seems to have been created with the use of a \"weed wacker.\" Since it appeared only two weeks prior to the release of the movie \"Signs,\" in which crop circles play a major role, there is speculation that there may be a connection. William Leone, an investigator for MUFON from Downers Grove, IL, was one of the first on the scene. He noted at the time that only an analysis of the plants and soil can determine the legitimacy of the circle, and this has not been done. He has indicated, however, that the circle does not appear to be legitimate. Nancy Talbott, director of BLT, Inc., the major crop circle investigating organization in the world, contacted Roger Sugden, MUFON Assistant State Director for In- diana, and Dwight Connelly, editor of the MUFON UFO Journal, to see if they could provide information on the circle. An on-site inspection by the two indicated that the plants were not whirled or laid down, but, rather, had been cut off, as by a string-type mower. Although Sugden and Connelly obtained permission from farmer Steve Berning to take soil and plant samples and make measurements, the owner of the land-who had an adjacent business-was upset with the numerous sightseeers who had visited the site, and refused to let the pair continue. The only overall measurement completed by Sugden and Connelly indicated the circle was about 209 feet in diameter, north to south, not including a \"hook\" protruding from the northeast section. Sugden took a radiation read- ing and found nothing unusual, but the circle was at least a week old at that time. The owner of the property told Connelly that his em- ployees had observed individuals in the field in broad day- light with \"weedwhackers.\" He did not explain why noth- ing was done about this. Overview and close-up photos have been sent to Talbott, and the few soil and plant samples taken are being stored, pending a decision on whether analysis of the few samples is justified.

Filer Director, MUFON Eastern Region George Filer Unless otherwise noted, these reports represent raw data which has not been verified by official investigations. Cattle found in water tank in Argentina SUCO — El Diario News reports, that on June 28, 2002, very near the border with San Luis Province a well- respected livestock producer found 19 animals within an Australian-type water tank. These tanks are steel-sided, sheet metal with a conical cap. Nine of the bovines were dead, according to subsequent medical-veterinarian ex- aminations, due to asphyxiation through immersion. The rest were alive, but affected by the low temperatures and were near dead due to freezing. The news was confirmed by police of- ficials of Regional Unit 7, headquar- tered at Rio Cuarto. What no one can explain is how the 19 animals could have entered the enormous water tank, bearing in mind that they first had to cross an electric drover, then a 1.50 meter tall fence, and finally, \"jump\" over the tank wall. Later, farmhands found a mutilated cow that had given birth to a calf. The cow was stressed, showing burns and precise incisions in different parts of her carcass, as though experts had deftly used a special scalpel. These cases, according Dr. Cumin, have been investi- gated from the onset by veterinarians from the National University of Rio Cuarto. Ufologists posited the chal- lenging possibility that teleportation occurred, moving the 19 animals of large size and weight from their cow pen into the tank.

They saw a very bright light off the port side of the boat in a westerly direction, about 35 degrees off the horizon. The witness reported, \"I realized it was moving in the same direction as us at about the same speed passing some treetops. I sped up the boat to about 30 mph and sure enough the lighted object did the same thing, just enough to stay with us. My wife and I were amazed that it reacted. \"Was it a fluke? We slowed right down again to al- most a stop, and it did the same. I sped up and turned 180 degrees and watched it turn the same way in the same direction. It banked in the turn, as opposed to an instant change of direction. I came to a stop and turned the lights out. It sat in the sky in one spot. I couldn't leave the lights off too long because another boat was coming along and passed me 200 feet off my starboard side. I thought the light might then pick up the other boat, but it stayed still. My wife was feeling spooked, so we decided to head back to the cottage. \"During this 5-minute trip our friend stayed with us. We tied up the boat, and the object drifted slowly out of our sight over the trees.\" Thanks to Sue Darroch sue@pararesearchers.org Para-Researchers Of Ontario http://www.pararesearchers.org Disc-shaped object spotted in British Columbia SURREY, BC — On June 20, 2002, the witness was out on his apartment balcony at 6:30 PM using his phone when he spotted a disc-shaped craft that was silver on top, with a darker bottom. He grabbed his field glasses, but was unable to detect a cupola on the craft. The sky was clear, and he estimated that the UFO was about 3000 feet from him at an altitude of 500 feet. It was hovering and moving slowly S.S.E. when he first saw it. He watched it move behind a house and finally lost it from view when it headed south and disappeared behind some trees. Total viewing time was 3 minutes. During the view- ing period he had time to phone Terry Tibando, Vancouver Working Group Coordinator for CSETI (Center for the Study of Extraterrestrial Intelligence) in Port Moody de- scribing what he was watching.

The symbols are 60 meters (200 feet) long. It is difficult to tell specific shapes as they were observed only from the ground. There are also other very small mark- ings nearby with symbols 3 to 4.5 meters (10 to 15 feet) in size, with the wheat stalks flattened in overlapping lay- ers, with some stalks bent over. There are numerous bent and swollen nodes on stalks, about 1.5 times normal size. This is the sixth report for 2002.

Baseball-size lights observed in Virginia ARLINGTON — A witnesses reports, \"My son and I were in the back yard of our house about 1:15 AM this morning because we had gone outside to get our cat, who was on a ledge outside the second floor window. We were both looking up at the side of the house wondering how long we would have to wait for her to come down when two circular white lights flew over the house, going more or less west to east or northeast. \"They were about the size of a baseball held at arm's length. We both saw it, and about two minutes later they came back again, from west to east/northeast. This time they both stopped-don't know how far away-they seemed close, although the spheres were small. \"They both stopped for a second, then one of the ob- jects 'flew' away at a right angle to its previous path of flight, not up in the sky, but back to the northwest at what seemed to be the same altitude as before. The other object remained motionless for five seconds maybe, then continued northeast on pretty much its original direction. They were definitely two different objects that were fly- ing in tandem at first, then split up. We ran out to the front yard with the video camera, but didn't see anything. They made no noise: If they weren't close they must have been huge. Similar sightings were seen in Waldorf, MD, about ten miles from us.\" Thanks to Peter Daven- port NUFORC Rapidly-moving oval reported by pilot KANSAS CITY — \"I am an air freight pilot that flies smaller, twin-engined aircraft, building experience to fly for the major airlines. I saw something strange on my way out of Kansas City International Airport on July 2, 2002.\" I have always been a skeptic and thought UFOs were bogus, until now. \"I saw a solid oval, no blinking lights or colored lights, moving rapidly across the sky from east to west. I've seen thousands of satellites before, and I know for sure this was NOT a satellite. Why? Because this object was about the size of a dime moving across my windscreen. I initially saw it on climb-out as it traveled from directly overhead to slightly above the horizon (about 1 thumb's width with your arm stretched outward) before I lost it in the haze. \"The object traveled this total distance in less than 3 minutes time. My estimate 250 to 300 miles. It had a soft, medium white silhouette light which illuminated the entire object. I was climbing out of 4500 feet at the time, and my guess was that the object was in excess of 50,000 feet. \"I inquired with ATC, to see if I had any potential con- flicting traffic. He panned his radar out to include all alti- tudes, and then he said nothing was on his scope except for a few low altitude targets that were in bound for K. C. International.

The following night the witness stated, \"I walked out unto my patio at 10:21 PM, and saw a string of lights, ran inside my house, grabbed my camcorder, and recorded this spectacle for a few seconds: There were about twenty lights all flashing a cherry red color, and all of them were flashing heading southeast. \"They started off in a triangular pattern and started forming a crescent shape. Some objects were further away and not part of the configuration. I was with two friends, and we were outside talking. Some red lights approaching from the north (going south) caught our at- tention. We saw a very huge boomerang or V-shaped object, with a bright white light at the 'nose,' and red blinking lights around its perimeter (maybe four or five on either side of the white light). \"We were all pretty impressed with its massive size and we kept the object in sight as it traveled along the coastline. We kept sight of it until it was too far away to see. It was totally silent and seemed to glide slowly across the sky. I am totally shocked it did not make the news, since it flew right over the LAX flight path.

SAN JOSE — A couple driving home last night at around 21:00 hours witnessed a large, sky-blue light mov- ing over the lagoon, changing color and size as it did so. Its color was red and it gave off flashes. Minutes later a local resident contacted EL FUERTE [to say that she had seen] the light descend and lose itself behind the treeline. An hour later, at 22:30, two other witnesses saw the same phenomenon. PARISH — The El Yunque ranch foreman informed EL TIEMPO that he found a bovine presenting signs of mutilation. The case, according to the rural worker's de- scription, is similar to others detected in the area and other parts of the country. In this specific case, the animal showed mutilations in the rectal area, tongue, eyes, and jaw. Four mutilated cows were found twelve kilometers southwest of Bartolome de las Casas, having the same characteristics as earlier cases.

Object with search lights reported in Russia PERM — Nikolay Subbotin, Director of the Russian UFO Research Station (RUFORS), reports that the \"hunt- ing season for UFOs is opened in Perm.\" In April a clas- sic silver saucer-shaped UFO was observed over the Ural region city. On June 29,2002, around 12:10 AM a UFO was videotaped from the 7th floor of a multi-storied apart- ment building. Mr. Maksim, who shot the video-footage, said his first impression was \"...this might be a bright star.\" But soon he noticed it was moving too fast, so he started shooting. On July 2, 2002, a UFO was observed further south of the original point of observation. It was too fast moving for a star or satellite, and was a very bright, pul- sating ovoid light. The video shows the moving object pulsating as it moved, making new jerks with every flash. On July 17, 2002, around 12:30 AM, over the Kama River, several witnesses observed a bright light and flashes inside the low clouds, slowly moving over the river. Sud- denly, two beams, like from searchlights, descended and started scanning the river and nearby houses. This stun- ning sighting lasted for two minutes. Then the beams vanished, light started going away, suddenly squeezing into a little dot and disappearing The impression was that the object, emitting light, suddenly zoomed up.

It could be identified as ordinary satellite, but the witness persistently states that it was moving twice as fast as any satellite. Bright white flashes and moving star-like objects were observed almost nightly after 2100 hours on July 24, 25, 26, 27, over the Sea of Azov.

Cosmonauts report \"Christmas tree\" obj ect Gennadij Strekhalov, aboard the MIR Space Station, says, \"On the last two flights I saw something. During the flight of 1990,1 called Gennadij Manakov, our commander: \"Come to the porthole. Unfortunately, but this is typical, we did not manage to put a film in the camera quickly enough to film it.\" We looked on Newfoundland, and the atmosphere was completely clear. And suddenly a kind of sphere appeared. I want to compare it with a Christmas tree decoration, beautiful, shiny, glittering. I saw it for ten seconds. The sphere appeared in the same way as it disappeared again. \"What it was, what size it had, I don't know. There was nothing I could compare it with. I was like struck by lightning by this phenomenon. It was a perfect sphere, glittering like a Christmas tree decoration. I reported to the Mission Control Center, but I did not say that I have seen a UFO. I said I saw a kind of unusual phenomenon. I had to be careful with the choice of my words. I don't want someone to speculate too much or quote me wrong.\" Cosmonaut Victor Afanashev's drawing of an elon- gated flying triangle UFO seen flying in formation in April 1979, is on my website.

Her comments were made in a discussion about Fermi's Paradox, which states that if there are extrater- restrials in the galaxy, then they must have colonized it. But there is no evidence of their presence here; therefore the implication is that they don't exist. Tartar says, \"I would claim that we don't know that. We've so poorly explored even the local neighborhood of our solar system that there could well be probes, arti- facts, even large, slow ships within our solar system that we wouldn't have detected yet. It's possible that there could be, in fact, within our solar system some evidence of an extraterrestrial technology.

Hansen, 2001, Xlibris, 81/2x5 1/2, 564 pages, through AmazoYi.com or Barnes & Noble, or (cheapest) directly from Xlibris ($22.94 paperback, $33.29 hardback or $8.00 ebook) www.Xlibris.com (1-888-795-4274) Reviewed by David Perkins Recently in the pages of this journal, Chris Aubeck, Dr. Barry Downing, and Brenda Denzler have discussed religious and folkloric themes in ufology. Jenny, Randies has called for a \"broadening of the search for answers\" to include such topics as pre- cognition and the psychic aspects of UFOs. More and more research- ers, it seems, are taking a fresh look at paranormal, mythological, and spiritual ideas. With his new book, The Trickster and the Paranormal, George Hansen enters the fray. Hansen's resume gives his insights some added gravity. He is one of the few people in America who has actually made a living by doing parapsychology/psi re- search. For a total of eight years, he was employed at the Rhine Research Center and the Psychophysical Labora- tories. Now, after seven years of writing and research, Hansen has unleashed his ambitious and scholarly tome examin- ing the current state of ufological, paranormal, and psy- chic research. The result is a fascinating and provocative piece of work with much potential value for ufolegists. According to Hansen, UFOs have been around for thousands of years, and it only makes sense for us to learn what we can about them from earlier cultures' reli- gions and myths. Trickster figures were endowed with paranormal powers, and were central to many of these myths. Some of the-best documented examples include Hermes of the Greeks, the coyote and raven of North American Indian tribes, Mercury of the Romans, Loki of the Norse, and Eshu of West Africa. The predominantly male trickster figures have much in common with UFOs and their occupants. They operate in an atmosphere of stealth, deception, and evasion. They teleport effortlessly between the heavens and the earth. They are the ultimate shapeshifters, able to breach walls and boundaries with ease. They have the ability to \"dis- solve time.\" Their encounters with humans frequently involve sexual relations and interbreeding. With eerie echoes of the \"mod- ern\" phenomena of crop circles and animal mutilations, tricksters frequently lay down \"nests\" in crops and evis- cerate animals. For all of their bedevilnient of humanity, tricksters also brought great benefits. These included new skills and technologies, such as fire, fish hooks, musical instruments, and language. The appearance of the trick- ster always signaled the advent of novel modes of thought and new views of reality. In his recent articles in the MUFON UFO Journal, Chris Aubeck chronicled the many striking similarities between the modern entities described by abduction re- searchers and the \"demons\" portrayed in the 1486 theo- logical treatise Malleus Maleficarum. As British re- searcher Patrick Harpur reminds us in his insightful book Daimonic Reality, \"all daimons are tricksters ...\" Perhaps Aubeck and Hansen are covering some of the same ground. This mythological and folkloric mate- rial, however, poses a conundrum for ufologists. Are the demon/tricksters actually extraterrestrial entities misin- terpreted by the superstitious and culturally biased belief systems of ancient times? Or... are they manifestations of humanity's deepest psychological underpinnings? Or... are they something else entirely? Hansen draws much of his material from research on the trickster and \"primitive\" religions done during the 1960s by Western anthropologists. He admits that much of this analytical work is highly abstract and theoretical, but \"nev- ertheless abstract theory can be powerful.\" He compares the \"trickster\" to a differential equation that governs and describes many seemingly unrelated things. One example would be UFOs and psychic phenom- ena, where Hansen sees a considerable \"overlap.\" As Randies and other researchers have noted, psychic expe- riences play a significant role in the lives of many close encounter witnesses. Virtually all of the U.S. government's psychic spies have encountered UFOs in their remote viewing excursions. Hansen quotes from a 1997 article by Gerald Haines, a historian at the National Reconnaisance Office, which suggests that intelligence agencies had a strong interest in these links: \"During the late 1970s and 1980s ... some in the Agency and in the Intelligence Community shifted their interest to studying parapsychology and psychic phe- nomena associated with UFO sightings.\" Mythological motifs Another area of overlap is the strong presence of mythological motifs in the accounts of many abductees, including the well-known experiences of Whitley Strieber and Betty Andreasson Luca. Still other overlaps involve UFOs and spirituality. Dr. Barry Downing argues that there is no \"scientific justification to continue to try to study UFOs apart from the religious dimension.\" Many of John Mack's \"experiencers\" have commented on the meaningful! spiri- tual dimensions of their UFO encounters. Mack coun- selled the 2001 MUFON Symposium on the \"terrible so- cial and religious consequences associated with rejecting the testimony of authentic witnesses.\" One of the primary qualities associated with the trick- ster is \"anti-structure,\" a concept introduced by anthro- pologist Victor Turner. Anti-structure refers to marginal, Page 18 MUFON UFO Journal September 2002"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"unstable and transitional conditions. Hansen's primary in- sight is that anti-structure describes much psychic and UFO phenomena, the environment around them, the experiences arid even the investigators. As an example of the antistructural nature of large-scale tricksterish out- breaks, Hansen notes that the pandemic UFO wave of 1964-68 in the U.S. coincided with a period of cultural transition and rapid social change. Also, during the breakup of the former Soviet Union, \"there was an explosion of paranormal activity throughout eastern Europe.\" An aversion to bureaucracies The inherent anti-structural nature of psi and UFO phe- nomena also connotes an aversion, or even antagonism, to large bureaucratic institutions. Hansen points out that there are no university departments devoted to UFOs or parapsychology. This \"anti-institutional\" aspect of ufology and parapsychology is apparent when limited and unstable funding comes from wealthy individuals rather than phil- anthropic organizations. .Although there appears to be avid public interest in paranormal themes, as witnessed by some of the top gross- ing movies of all times, such attention does not translate into funding for research. A message is subtly conveyed that the phenomena are \"fictional.\" Hansen ponders why SETI gets far more support from established institutions than does ufology. Ufology has a massive amount of real data, while SET! has virtually nothing to show for itself. Millions of people have seen UFOs, yet mainline funding sources disdain ufology. The marginality of UFOs is also perpetuated by what Hansen terms \"reversals,\" another feature of anti-structure. For instance, some of the best cases are ignored by the media (Cash-Landrum and Eddie Doyle Webb, which Hansen praises) whereas the.more fragile cases receive enormous attention (Roswell, Gulf Breeze). Hansen's corrosive critique of the CSICOP skeptics alone is worth the price of admission, but his chapter \"Gov- ernment Disinformation\" is the most disturbing and per- plexing. The chapter reads like a dark episode of the \"X-Files,\"complete with shadowy \"operatives,\" danger- ous intrigues, betrayals, human folly, and murky, compet- ing agendas supposedly involving the future of humanity. Schizoid policies? Hansen details the government's seemingly schizoid UFO policies, both official and unofficial. First... they do exist. Then... they don't exist. Then... they might exist. Then... whatever they are, they pose no threat. Then ... they are taking over the world. Then ??? Even arch UFO debunker and NASA scientist James Oberg seems puzzled. Hansen quotes from an Oberg letter: \"from my own experience, they [the government) seem to have played a tremendous role in inciting and enflaming public interest in UFOs.\" The intelligence community in particular is given close scrutiny by Hanseni He points out that the only really substantial and sustained funding for parapsychology and psi-related research has come from the intelligence agen- cies. Since their job is institutionalized deception, it is logi- cal that they would gravitate to these \"tricky\" realms. Hansen raises the possibility that some government personnel are \"manipulating public belief in order to es- tablish a new mythology...\" and he questions whether the promotion of mythological beliefs is healthy for the larger society. In the short run, the government's disinformation and cover-up tactics have bred more fear and distrust in government. In the long-run, the policies may have been designed to bluff the Soviets into thinking that the U.S. has obtained alien technology, or to signal that the U.S. actually does have it. Another possibility is that the military anticipated a massive decrease in post Cold War funding and needed the public to believe in some other external threat. The permutations are limitless, and maybe total confusion is the goal. It's hard to be united when you're confused. A wealth of material available Despite the prodigious amount of static generated by the government on the UFO issue, Hansen still has cause for hope. There is a wealth of material to analyze if those who tread the slippery slopes of ufology can cultivate \"a high tolerance for ambiguity to avoid premature conclu- sions or paranoia.\" He cautions researchers to detach themselves emo- tionally, and to understand that \"the shrieking and sneer- ing attacks on ufology\" are reactions not to ufologists, but to the UFO phenomenon itself. There is something \"extremely important about UFOs\" that can be ascertained if researchers can overcome ten- dencies toward \"personal destabilization\" and the feel- ings of disappointment and disillusionment that seem to go with the territory. MUFON Director John Schuessler has also commented on dealing with \"the unique types of stress due to the nature of the job.\" Perhaps there is a reason why the early psychiatrists were called \"alienists.\" In The Trickster and the Paranormal George Hansen goes beyond the obvious trickster/UFO parallels and at- tempts a \"grand synthesis,\" a new way of approaching all the great mysteries. He dislikes the current trend of re- ferring to UFO and paranormal phenomena as \"anoma- lous,\" because such labeling \"divorces the phenomena of today from their historical predecessors.\" The implication is that anomalous phenomena are \"merely minor curiosities, without threat or of much im- mediate import.\" Of course any well-rounded ufologist should be familiar with mythology and other possible his- torical antecedents of the UFO phenomenon. What comes through clearly in Hansen's work are the reasons why the UFO remains the greatest challenge to science. A thorough examination Hansen's most significant contribution, however, is his thorough and comprehensive examination of the vast ar- ray of forces which have aligned themselves to keep ufology marginal. It is arguably the best analysis of its kind ever written. If we are going to attempt to under- stand UFOs, we must not only grapple with the phenom- enon itself, but we must also proceed with a complete understanding of the powers that would attempt to im- pede our progress.

According to investigating police officer Marcelo Alarcon, \"On Friday afternoon, Raul Dorado, 64, was touring the field located 5 kilometers (3 miles) northeast of town (Jacinto Arauz), as he is accustomed to do. The man explained that he had heard sound on two occa- sions, like a whirlwind, which drew his attention. The third time, he saw something he describes as a green circle with three legs hovering over him. \"At that moment, Dorado fell to the ground and, ac- cording to his story, he carried a shotgun, binoculars, and a cell phone, the last of which was taken from his hand, and he could clearly see it being sucked into the object, which was apparently at low altitude.\" In an interview with the newspaper La Nueva Proyincia, Dorado described his experience with the green UFO: \"As I was heading back toward the farmhouse, where I'd left the car, that's when the thing appeared,\" Dorado said. \"It was a dim, green-colored circumference-although in daylight I wasn't able to see its luminosity. It had three legs and was barely a meter (3.3 feet) to a meter-and-a- half (5 feet) away from me,\" he stated. \"When I saw it,\" he continued, \"I felt something like an electrical charge. I fell to the ground on my knees, paralyzed, unable to do anything, with my shotgun lean- ing on the ground. I was also carrying binoculars and had a cell phone in my left hand, which was sucked up by the green circle. I saw it rising and disappearing.'\" As the object disappeared toward the east, Dorado said he remained at the location for an hour before being able to rise and walk back to his car, returning to town in a state of shock. Aided by his wife and neighbors, the man was admitted to the local hospital, where he was cared for by Dr. Ana Maria Lazaric. Following this incident, Deputy Sheriff Daniel Rosane decided to do some investigating on his own. Rosane re- ported that he has since dialed the cell phone's number a few times. It would ring and then make the typical sound of when buttons are being pressed to dial. In a subsequent attempt, he discovered that the phone was answered, but he heard only breathing sounds. In later attempts, the operator reported that the phone was either shut off or out of range.

By Stan Gordon On Aug. 1,2002,1 received an interesting report of an encounter with an unusual object that had taken place on July 24, 2002. I had the opportunity to interview the re- porting witness later that day. The sighting occurred in a shopping complex in North Huntingdon Township, in Westmoreland County, PA. The incident involved three witnesses-a man, his wife, and a friend. Since these people hadn't seen each other for some time, they stood in the parking lot and got in- volved in a long conversation. It was about 10 P.M., and the local businesses had all been closed for awhile. In the middle of the conversation, the friend suddenly said, \"Look behind you.\" They turned around to look, and observed a small odd object which looked like a bubble, but was \"absolutely round and shiny.\" The sphere was estimated to be the size of a tennis ball. While it gave the appearance of looking something like a bubble, the wit- ness described it as \"solid, in a way not like a bubble. You could see thickness in the wall of the object.\" As they watched, the object floated past them at a distance of no more than 10 feet. The object, which was only six feet off the ground, continued to move slowly in a straight line down the middle of the road. The witness commented, \"It was a perfectly calm night, with no wind at all, yet this bubble zoomed on past us as if being driven by something unseen.\" (The Pittsburgh Na- tional Weather Service Office verifies that the winds were calm at the time.) As the object continued to move straight down the road, at one point it zig-zagged left then right, and was halfway down the complex when they lost sight of it. At one point it passed under an awning, and it was apparent that there were no strings attached to it. The object did reflect light from the overhead lighting. There was no sound detected during the approximately 20-second observation. There was no one else in sight during the observation.

James McAndrew, author of the 1997 2nd Volume, mercifully only 231 pages long, \"The Roswell Report: Case Closed.\" (In the TV program for reasons unknown, it was dated 1998.) In the first place 11 boxes is not a lot of material. USAF Headquarters Files for the Post WWII period until about 1956 totalled 9,800 feet of material, or about 1,000 4- drawer filing cabinets. I have been to 19 Archives, and at none of the archives including the Nat. Archives in Col- lege Park ,MD, where some of the TV program was shot, was I asked to use gloves as were shown. There was great drama when a triangular box was slowly opened to reveal, guess what, a radar reflector used with weather balloons. Connection with Roswell? NONE. It was pristine, clearly had a light foil backed with paper that any 3-year-old could tear. Where was the very strong foil with no backing de- scribed by Maj. Marcel and Mack and Bill Brazel? That material when folded many times would come back to its original shape. The reflector material was certainly not memory metal. The narrator claimed the that the Roswell witnesses said the wreckage included balsa wood. More nonsense. Jesse Marcel told me that the I-beams weighed almost nothing, just like balsa wood, but couldn't be cut, broken, or burned-very much unlike balsa wood. Where were the strange lavender symbols on the I- beam as described by Dr. Jesse Marcel Jr.? Where was the 2\" wide toy factory tape used to hold the radar reflec- tors together? Its strange symbols were supposedly mis- taken for what Dr. Marcel described. None has been found, not even in the picture taken in Gen. Ramey's of- fice snowing him and then Col. (later Retired General) T J DuBose and some phony wreckage. A small piece of a video of Gerald Anderson (I shot the footage) was shown, and it was falsely claimed he was speaking to government investigators. On that same 105-minute video, \"Recollections of Roswell\" (assembled by the Fund for UFO Research), is testimony from 26 other witnesses, including Gen. DuBose. He makes clear that the material in the photo was substituted for the real wreckage. Using only the brief Anderson clip and none of the other witness testimony is a great example of selective choice of data, which we have come to expect from anti- Roswell propagandists. Many films are shown of huge teardrop-shaped poly- ethylene balloons. None were used for Mogul balloon trains until after Roswell. Instead, the small neoprene balloons were used. Repeatedly we were told how highly classi- fied Mogul and other USAF programs were. Mogul was so classified that several launches were allowed to just float on down in the middle of nowhere without a chase plane or jeep recovering it. None of the technology-only the purpose-was classified. Not a shred of evidence was presented to link the supposed June 14 launch of a Mogul balloon train to Roswell. The program falsely claimed that Marcel changed his tune and made up a new story in the late 1970s, and then researchers swarmed all over him. He supposedly was sent out to the crash site and then was joined by a platoon of soldiers!! Neither Marcel nor Brazel via his family or neighbors ever said any such thing. Jesse told me in 1978, in his first conversation about the incident in years, that the rancher had come into town on Sunday, July 6 (The Program made it sound like Brazel called the base-despite not having a phone-on the 7th.) Marcel and CIC Capt. Sheridan Cavitt followed Brazel out to the ranch, spent the night in sleeping bags, having had a can of beans, and then went to the site, loaded two vehicles with wreckage, leaving almost all of it behind, and went the long way back to town. Yet the program snowed Brazel picking up a small amount of crunched up aluminum foil with his daughter or September 2002 MUFON UFO Journal Page 2!"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"wife, who was not even with him at the ranch.. This fol- lows the obviously false claim of Cavitt in an interview with Col. Weaver that he suddenly recalled just a small amount of wreckage from an obvious weather balloon which covered an area only 20 feet square and would easily fit in one vehicle. Of course, if that had been the case, Brazel would have taken it all with him to the Sheriffs office in Roswell, and there would have been no reason for Marcel and Cavitt to make the long trek, much of it cross country, to the ranch. Marcel, in our first conversation in 1978 and as shown on the Rec.of Roswell tape and in my Video \"UFOs ARE Real,\" said the wreckage covered an area about % of a mile long and hundreds of feet wide. There was nothing conventional such as vacuum tubes, wires, rivets, etc. He had had a course in radar, and knew about radar reflec- tors, which had to be very light weight. In his volume, Weaver described the genesis of the crash story, making the following false statement: \"In 1978 an article appeared in a tabloid newspaper, the Na- tional Inquirer (sic) which reported the former intelli- gence officer, Marcel, claimed that he had recovered UFO debris near Roswell in 1947. Also in 1978 a UFO re- searcher, Stanton Friedman, met with Marcel and began investigating the claims that the material Marcel handed was from a crashed UFO.\" The story has just been tabloidized, since the only way the National Enquirer could have known about Marcel is if he had gone to them with his story. The fact is that the Enquirer article appeared in 1980, well after William Moore and I had talked to 62 witnesses while working on the first book The Roswell Incident. I didn't get my lead from the Enquirer. In early 1978, I had been referred to Jesse by an old ham radio buddy of his who had seen the original wire story about the crashed saucer, and was twiddling his thumbs as manager of the TV station where I was being interviewed to promote my lecture that night at LSU in Baton Rouge, LA. The reporter, fortunately, was late. Jesse didn't go to the Enquirer or to me. I gave their excellent reporter, Bob Pratt, Marcel's address. Marcel did not change any earlier story. He hadn't given one. When does my membership/subscription expire? The answer to this question appears on the mailing label on each Journal (see example be- low) 01/05 Name Street Address City, State, Zip The first line on the label provides the answer. The first two numbers show the year of expira- tion (01=2001,02=2002, etc). The two numbers after the slash show the month of expiration and show the last issue that will be mailed (05=May, 08=Aug, 1 l=Nov, etc.). That National Enquirer story was probably respon- sible for Capt. (and outstanding pilot) \"Pappy\" Henderson's telling his wife Sappho around 1980 about having seen the wreckage and bodies and flown wreck- age to Wright Patterson. Sappho and. her daughter and his good friend, Dr. John Kromshroeder, told their story on that same video. Karl Pflock, author of the Roswell debunking book Roswell: Inconvenient Facts and the Will to Believe dismissed Pappy as a practical joker who, rather than handing Dr. Kromshroeder a small piece of saucer wreck- age back in 1978, on John's honor as a former naval of- ficer not to talk about it, had supposedly shown him a piece of a V-2 rocket that he had. The family knew about the V-2 piece. Pappy's son and son-in-law also held the strange wreckage. Pappy had also quietly told his story to his WW II bombardier, the late Vere McCarthy, who in 1989 wrote me about it in response to my call, and even had been one of Pappy's pallbearers in 1986. Pflock doesn't say any of this in his book or in his many negative com- ments in the History Channel video. McAndrew had focused on various crash test dum- mies used to evaluate ejection seats and methods of jump- ing out of very high altitude balloons. Nice visuals of these experiments were shown in the video. These had abso- lutely nothing to do with Roswell, especially since none were dropped until after 1953. McAndrew used a map of drop locations three times. Strange there were no dum- mies dropped near either the Foster Ranch or Plains of San Augustin crash sites! The man in charge of the program told me that the dummies were 6 feet tall and weighed 175 pounds. Could anybody mistake such items for small alien beings??? Time travel was further demonstrated by the claim that the reported red headed officer seen by Glenn Dennis at the Roswell Army Air Force base (and also independently claimed to have been observed in the Plains by Gerald Anderson, in both cases accompanied by a black ser- geant) was actually famed red haired pilot Joe Kittinger, who had been to the hospital with a friend injured by a balloon that had come down near Roswell. This was 1959!! No black sergeant seen. Naturally there was a chase team present very quickly. It was claimed that because the military wasn't desegregated until 1948 there could not have been a black sergeant with a white officer. FALSE. Black sergeants were allowed to work with se- curity dog patrols, of which there were several at the Sandia National Lab in Albuquerque from which the Of- ficer had supposedly come. Other visually interesting items were shown, such as a chimp in a space capsule and a bear used for a space launch. People out in the desert seeing these coming down would obviously have thought they were space aliens!! NONSENSE It wasn't noted that none of these experiments were conducted until well after Roswell, and that there were always chase teams to dissuade any tourists in the desert from interfering. The \"expert\" team included Dr. Robert Park, a mem- ber of the American Physical Society (as are Dr. Bruce Page 22 MUFON UFO Journal September 2002"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"Maccabee, Dr. Robert M. Wood, and myself. All active in MUFON.) Park is the APS chief debunker of all things \"paranormal.\" His 10 pages in \"Voodoo Science: The Road from Foolishness to Fraud\" about UFOs in general and Roswell in particular are a splendid example of the pseudoscience of anti-ufology. He bought into the McAndrew and Weaver opuses (crash test dummies, Project Mogul, ad nauseum) hook line and sinker, and couldn't even get straight simple facts, such as that George Wilcox was sheriff of Chavez County not Lincoln County, and ignored the fact that newspaper articles of July 8, 1947, noted that the wreckage had been found by Rancher Brazel \"last week,\" not the June 14 date deemed appropriate by the Army Air Force People who reprogrammed the rancher with \"new\" (dis)info as noted in the Roswell Daily Record on July 9. Park casually has the false story of Maj. Marcel load- ing sticks, cardboard, and metal foil into the trunk of his car growing over the years into a major operation. There isn't the slightest indication that he read any of the books briefly flashed across the screen, including Don Berliner's and my Crash at Corona, and three books by Kevin Randle, very briefly shown on the program. The noisy negativists clearly had done no independent research, and accepted Weaver and McAndrew. A silly attempt was made to link the nearby crash in 1956 of a bomber resulting in 11 crewmen being burned to death with mortician Glenn Dennis' confusing this with Roswell aliens. Speaking to me at the Ballard Funeral Home, Glenn recalled that crash very well. Another ludi- crous claim on the program was that the International UFO Museum and Research Center in Roswell is owned by Glenn Dennis and Walter Haut, who had issued the famous press release!! It is a non-pro tit organization, does not charge admission, and is NOT owned by them. It has had 1.2 Million visitors in less than a decade. Those who want facts about Roswell didn't find them in this program, which will, of course, be repeated, as was the 1999 History Channel production. An excellent source is outstanding researcher David Rudiak's website http:www.Roswellproof.homestead.com .

September 2002 MUFON UFO Journal October 2002 Bright Planets (Evening Sky): Venus (magnitude -4.5) is especially visible until around mid-October to southern observers. Look for it at dusk low in the WSW. Saturn (-0.1), in Orion, rises in the ENE around 10:30 on the 1st and about 7:30 on the 31st. The planet giant begins retrograde (westward) motion on Oct. 11. It can be seen about 3 degrees below the gibbous Moon on the night of the 25th-26th. Bright Planets (Morning Sky): Mercury reaches a point farthest W of the Sun on Oct. 13, a favorable appearance for the tiny orange world. Look for it after the 1 st week of the month low in the E at twilight below fainter red Mars. See Mars. Mars (1.8), in Virgo, improves its position in the E at dawn, rising about 5 AM. It is paired with somewhat brighter Mercury, the former being 3 degrees above the latter on the 10th. Thereafter, the separation between the two planets widens. Jupiter (-2.1), in Cancer, rises in the ENE about 1 AM in mid-October and is about halfway up the SE sky by dawn. This largest planet is visible 4 degrees to the left of the lunar crescent on the 2nd. Saturn reaches a point high in the SSW at dawn. Moon Phases: New moon-Oct. 6; First quarter-Oct. 13; Full moon- Oct. 21; Last quarter-Oct. 29 The Stars: October evenings bring into view a portion of the sky in the S known in ancient times as \"The Sea.\" All its constellation members are inconspicuous and have an aquatic theme. Sweeping W to E, the observer comes upon diaper-shaped Capricornus the Sea Goat, Aquarius the Water Bearer (his water jug is a small \"Y\" of stars), Piscis Austrinus the Southern Fish (has a bright white star Fomalhaut), Pisces the Fish (two strings of stars form a big \"V\"), and Cetus the Sea Monster (a sprawling pat- tern below Pisces). Fomalhaut (fo-mal-hot) in Piscis Austrinus is the only bright star in this entire \"watery\" region. It is the south- ernmost bright luminary seen from northern latitudes. Be alert to a number of celestial IFO candidates near the horizon around 9 PM. Atmospheric refraction close to the horizon can cause stellar objects to appear to move and change color, brightness, and shape. These low-level objects are Capella (NE), Aldebaran (ENE), Fomalhaut (SSE), and Arcturus (WNW). Con- trary to popular belief, even the normally steady planets can be affected by the atmosphere if they are low enough. Page 23"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"By John F. Schuessler MUFON International Director The Celebration of Doing MUFON's excellent volunteer cadre is comprised of the people who work tirelessly to keep UFO investiga- tions and research on track. They investigate, record, analyze, communicate, and never quit digging for answers. They are applauded by all of the people they help, and at times are criticized by people who lack an understanding of the importance of their work. With this in mind, one of our volunteers sent me a state- ment attributed to President Theodore Roosevelt in 1910. While is it not politically correct today because it refers only to men, the message fits the situation faced by all work- ers. It reads as follows: \"It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, and comes short again and John Schuessler again, because there is no effort without error and short- coming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows the great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievements, and who at worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who know neither victory nor defeat.\" Position Announcements The state of Washington has a natural mountain bar- rier between the eastern and western regions of the state. This makes the management of investigations and organi- zation growth across the state very difficult. Therefore, based upon a recommendation by State Director Gerald Rolwes, we will have a State Director for each region. Jerry will continue as State Director for Eastern Wash- ington and Kathleen Anderson has assumed the role of State Director for Western Washington. The state of Oregon has new leadership. Laura Banry of Medford is the new State Director and Tom Bovvden of Gresham is the new Assistant State Director. Nicholas Roesler, State Director for Wisconsin, ap- pointed Matthew Sloan of Appleton to the position of Assistant State Director. David Marler, State Director for Illinois, appointed David Finkbeiner to the position of State Section Di- rector for the Illinois counties of Jo Davicss, Stephenson, Winnebago, and Boone. Ken Cherry, State Director for Texas, appointed Monica Morris to the position of State Section Director for Parker County. Bland Pugh, State Director for Florida, appointed Michael Forte to the position of State Section Director for the Florida counties of Hillsborough and Pinellas. After a brief hiatus, James Carrion has returned to the position of State Section Director for the Colorado counties of Weld, Morgan, Logan. Sedgwick, Phillips, Yuma, and Washington. James Bouck, State Director for New York, ap- pointed William J. Callahan to the position of State Sec- tion Director for Warren and Washington counties. Jon Nowinski has been appointed to the position of Consultant in Parapsychology. Dennis Glassberg has been appointed to the position of Research Specialist in Intellectual Property Rights.
