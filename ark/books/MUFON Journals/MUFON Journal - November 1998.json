Years after the surgical removal of their alleged alien implants, five individuals courageously agreed to take part in an interview to discuss their \"before and after effects.\" All persons, one male and four females, shared one thing in common: UFO encounters and con- tact with non-human alien beings. Dr. Roger Leir, a podiatrist from Thousand Oaks, CA, founder of FIRST (Fund for Interactive Research and Space Technology), and Derrel Sims, C.Ht., R.H.A., a certified hypnotherapist, co-founder of FIRST, and ex- perienced UFO Investigator for more than 27 years, orches- trated the successful surgeries with a team of competent medical professionals and vol- unteers. The first set of \"im- plant\" surgeries took place on Aug. 19, 1995, at Dr. Roger Leir's podiatry clinic in Thousand Oaks. PatParrinellio, a 47-year-old male from Hous- ton, TX, and Mary Jones (a pseudonym), 52, also from Texas, had the anomalous objects appear in X- rays, although both UFO experiencers had no record of pre- vious surgeries. Both individuals were investigated by Sims, chief investigator for HUFON (Houston UFO Network) and referred to Dr. Leir for surgery, based on their past UFO encounters and X-rays which con- firmed the anomalous objects. Pat's object was re- moved from the back of his left hand, and Mary's ob- jects excised from her left big toe. All services were performed at no charge. The alleged implants removed from the first set of surgeries were studied by two different patholo- gists, and then sent to various independent laborato- ries for extensive scientific analysis. The tests per- formed on these alleged alien implants included a pa- thology/tissue evaluation, laser induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS), extensive metallurgical testing involving a density immersion test. X-ray energy dis- persive spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction pattern analysis, and electron/mag- netic and fluorescence property analysis. Isotopic range tests are also in progress. Tests were conducted by the National Institute of Discovery Science (N1DS), New Mexico Tech, and other independent sources.

She has been running an abductee sup- port group in San Diego County, CA, for several years, has experience in hypnosis, and reports that she has been an abductee since childhood. EDITOR'S NOTE: There is, of course, dis- agreement as to whether \"implants\" exist. From the point of view of those who consider themselves recipients of implants, this is a moot point. If there are such things as implants, they represent physi- cal evidence. While some interesting research has been done, a great deal more is needed. ated for scientific study, another set of implant surger- ies took place on May 18, 1996. Two women from this second set of surgeries came forward for this in- terview and follow-up study. Dorothy OHara, a 61- year-old female from Palm Springs, CA, and Alice Leavy, 40, from Newberry Park, CA, each had similar objects removed from their left lower legs. Another woman, Licia Davidson, 37, who has had numerous UFO and alien encounters, had a rare, crystalline-like object removed from her foot in January of 1997. \"The findings of these implant surgeries are highly unusual,\" according to Dr. Leir. \"In all these cases, there was virtually no inflammatory response.\" This is not the usual finding in foreign tissue reactions. Normally, foreign bodies embedded in tissues result in some type of acute or chronic inflammatory response, and may include fibrosis and cyst formation. Such was not the case here. • The pathology reports of the first two surger- ies revealed that the metallic objects were encased in a very dense, tough, grey membrane consisting of pro- teinaceous coagulum, hemoseridin and pure keratin- more simply, blood protein and skin cells that are usu- ally found in the superficial layer of the skin. The tough, biological \"cocoons\" encasing the implants were also found to contain nerve proprioceptors-nerve and pres- sure cells of the wrong tissue type for that part of the body. These implant cocoons also fluoresced a bright green color in the presence of an ultraviolet light source. No metallic properties The implants from the two womeri from the second set of surgeries did not exhibit metallic proper- ties like the implants from the first set of surgeries. In fact, the spheroid, whitish objects did not contain the tough, biological outer jackets, or flubresce from a U V light source. These types of implants (possibly bio- logical) also lacked the expected inflammatory re- sponse, according to the pathology reports. The"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Page 4 November 1998 MUFON UFO Journal crystalline-like object excised from the foot in the most recent surgery also lacked the tough, grey outer mem- brane and had virtually no inflammatory response, as in the other implant surgeries. Test results from the first set of implants revealed that the lammelar, needle- shaped metallic objects in question are basically mete- oric in origin, containing at least eleven different ele- ments. Uncommon response In an interview with Alien Encounters Maga- zine (July 1997 issue, United Kingdom), Sims com- mented on the uncommon, non-rejecting human re- sponse to the implants: \"It seems that the dense fibrous membrane may have been the person's own surface skin. If this is the case, it appears that the metallic ob- jects are wrapped in a sheath of keratinaceous mate- rial (surface skin). Nerve fibers then surround the tis- sue and appear to be attached to larger nerves. The fact that both persons (from the first set of surgeries) objected verbally and physically could be an indica- tion of this (nervous system) connection.\" Sims be- lieves the indications are very strong that these im- plants are extraterrestrial in origin. \"But,\" Sims con- cedes, \"whatever the scientists who have examined the objects say is what we will say.\" Sims has stated that a scientific peer review of all tests must be done before more specifics can be released. Scientific evaluation is our best ally, but the experiences and opinions of the courageous individu- als involved in these implant surgeries are equally im- portant. A series of simple questions were posed to each of the participants. When asked how and when their implants might have been inserted, Pat Parrinellio said he believed his implant could have been inserted during a UFO encounter he had in 1954, at six years of age. Two encounters Mary Jones recalls two UFO encounters in 1969 when her metallic objects could have been im- planted. \"In the first frightening UFO encounter,\" she commented, \"I was on a camping trip with my family while pregnant with my third child.\" Oddly enough, one month after Mary's child was born, she had an- other alien encounter while at home during the night. Conversely, Dorothy OHara and Licia Davidson both said they have no idea when the object was inserted. Alice Leavy commented that she first noticed the lump on her leg following a UFO encoun- ter involving other witnesses in San Diego in 1993. \"I actually noticed the lump,\" Alice clarified, \"when I dis- covered the scoop mark also on my left leg, after the UFO encounter.\" If the alien \"abductors\" are responsible for implanting objects in the bodies of their abductees, then are the aliens cognizant of the fact that the implants have been removed? So the next question was posed, \"Did you experience any UFO sightings, alien abduc- tions, odd dreams, missing time or paranormal events just prior to, or after the implant surgery? (within a month)\" Pat Parinellio revealed, \"Yes, an unusual set of events took place with another witness involving an orange glowing UFO one evening about a week be- fore the surgery. After the surgery, I noticed that my psychic abilities seemed to decrease.\" Dorothy replied, \"About a week before the surgery I had a dream-like abduction experience in- volving many other people in a large locker room type facility, waiting in line for what seemed to be a shot in the backs of our necks. Also, right before an appoint- ment to meet one of Derrel Sims'associates for an in- terview (regarding the implant surgery), I and another woman had a strange experience. It was like getting stuck in a time warp. I ended up being very late for the appointment. And then, late one evening after I returned from the surgery, I had an alien encounter that I couldn't clearly recall.\" Nothing unusual Both Licia and Alice did not recall any unusual events shortly before or shortly after the implant sur- gery. Mary experienced a rare pain and swelling in her toe and foot about a week before the surgery. \"At that time,\" Mary revealed, \"I knew exactly where the ob- jects were in my foot. I could feel them.\" Prior to that, Mary had no pain or sensations of that kind in her toe. \"What was really strange,\" Mary admitted, \"was that the moment I stepped out of the car to meet Derrel Sims just prior to the surgery, my pain stopped.\" The real question one may wonder about is: now that the implants have been removed, will the aliens continue to come back and abduct the abductees? All individuals except Mary Jones were able to an- swer with a resounding, \"Yes.\" Alice elaborated on an abduction she had two months after the implant surgery: \"I retired to bed early due to a headache. My husband awoke at 1 a.m. be- cause the whole bedroom lit up like daylight. He looked at the clock, reached over to touch me, and found that I was gone. Paradoxically, my husband quickly went back to sleep. The next day I felt very ill. I don't recall anything during the night, but I noticed the next day that my dog had nervously clawed several areas in the house, as if he were trying to escape something fright- ening.\" All report changes As to changes in health, mood, dreams or psy- chic phenomena after the surgery, all five agreed as to some type of change. Mary Jones simply stated that she felt a sense of peace after her objects were removed."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal November 1998 Page 5 Dorothy commented, \"I felt a tremendous sense of re- lief after the surgery.\" Licia remarked, \"Yes, I had a dramatic and immediate mood lift after the object was removed from my foot. I also stopped having the pain and the weird, watery sensation surrounding my foot.\" Severe diuretic effect The most striking changes were noted by Dor- othy. \"I had a severe diuretic effect and lost much wa- ter weight a week following the surgery. Then my health progressively worsened and I developed angina and edema. This heart problem was a recurring complica- tion from a previous illness I had in my late twenties. I also experienced extreme fatigue, and could not con- centrate. The illness lasted about a month, after which my energy and health returned with more vigor. My creativity and mental clarity improved remarkably. (She is a writer) I had a startling improvement in my memory where I was able to recall a previous alien abduction experience from 1991. In other words, it was the first time I was able to pierce through a screen memory from an abduction, although it took me three days to process the memory. It was difficult mentally and emo- tionally. In hindsight, after the implant surgery and re- covery from illness, I felt detoxified.\" Pat, on the other hand, noticed a more subjec- tive change and simply stated, \"Yes, a part of me which remains hidden has undergone quite a few changes of paradigms.\" A common sympton Alice and Dorothy shared a common symptom several months after their surgeries. Alice remarked, \"About eight months afterwards, I had shooting pains in my left leg and noticed the implant scar turned bright red and hurt, and lasted for about a week. Also, around that same time period I had a strong, precognitive vi- sion that later came true in exact detail.\" Dorothy added, \"Yes, I also noticed a strange reaction in my leg and implant scar about six months after the surgery. I felt shooting pains in my left leg, especially at the implant site. The incision scar turned bright red for a month.\" Could these changes in each of the individuals interviewed alter their views of the UFO phenomenon after the fact? Pat admitted he was basically in denial about the UFO abduction phenomenon prior to the sur- gery. \"And yet,\" Pat stated, \"it seems like the more one becomes aware of the fact, the more I realize that I don't know anything. But I do sense that something is accelerating.\" Dorothy concurred with Pat in that she formerly believed the UFO phenomeona was all nonsense. Af- terwards, Dorothy realized, \"I have been able to work through many issues in my life, now that I am no longer in denial. Now I have a more practical and spiritual approach to life, and am more concerned with helping others in a practical sense, not promoting some New Age or metaphysical philosophy.\" Mary also admitted she had no interest or knowledge of the UFO abduction phenomenon previ- ously. \"Even now,\" she added, \" I have no real interest in the UFO topic, yet cannot deny there is something to it.\" Both Licia and Alice had a good knowledge of the UFO abduction field. Licia stated that her views have not really changed. \"The best way I can describe it,\" Licia explained, \"is that I have had a real power- ful, extreme source of the highest of highs and the low- est of lows.\" Alice admitted, \"Previously, I felt the .aliens were possibly evil. Now, after the surgery and as life and my abductions continue, I think the aliens just have a job to do. It's not a good job. I think they are just following orders.\" Is the truth being told? So, is the UFO community at large telling the whole truth about what really happens to abductees? Pat says, \"Truth is subjective. I know there are a few researchers who are holding to the narrow line of find- ing out what is going on.\" Alice agreed that for the most part, the abduction researchers are reporting things as they are experienced, but for one small exception. Some top researchers are not mentioning the apparent military involvement. Licia concurred with Alice: \"Top researchers are touching on the major issues, but in my opinion, do not want to get involved in the govern- ment end of it.\" Dorothy forthrightly stated, \"Many people in the UFO community have their heads in the clouds and believe in an overly benevolent, fanciful spiritual phi- losophy. There is not enough critical analysis. I have learned more from one-on-one conversations with other abductees than from the public lecture circuit.\" The important thing to consider here is the whole clinical picture. Physical test results of the im- plants alone are not substantial enough to solve the implant mystery-let alone the question of the alien pres- ence. If not, then what is? The lives and experiences of the abductees themselves tell us that we need to stop and listen. The answer lies somewhere between sci- ence and the hearts of the people. © 1998 Eve Frances Lorgen Editor-in-Chief Walter Andrus, Jr. Notes: Alice Leavy is the former MUFON State Section Direc- tor for the Santa Barbara/Ventura section in Cali- fornia.

The \"Sky-Eye\" chip, an adaptation of Global Po- sitioning Network technology developed by Israeli intelli- gence researchers, is being marketed by Gen-Etics, a com- pany based in Milan, Italy, that has patented the device for private use. In Italy, kidnapping is so commonplace that many elected officials and corporate executives travel everywhere with armed bodyguards. Gen-Etics spokesman Nicholas Ventura told reporters that \"we are receiving hundreds of requests for implants, not only from Italy but also from other countries, especially Germany and the United States.\" Each device costs $9,000. The \"Sky-Eye\" chip reportedly contains a unique 8-digit number which can be accessed by a satellite in case the im- planted person is kidnapped or missing. According to Gen- Etics, the chip will pinpoint the person's location within 165 yards. It draws energy directly from the human nervous sys- tem and is invisible to both X-rays and the human eye. It is implanted in a part of the body that can't be amputated, Ventura said. [Based on an Oct. 6 report in Electronic Tele- graph and an Oct. 12 report on Discovery Channel Online.] CNI News comment: Consumer-level implant tech- nology this sophisticated suggests that military intelli- gence versions of the same or better technology may have been in use for many years. Claims of some ab- duction researchers that tracking and monitoring de- vices have been implanted in abductees-whether by alien or military operatives-gains credence in light of Gen-Etics' revelation. -Thanks to CNI News Abstract for patent for Programmable Subcutaneous Visible Implant listed A subcutaneous implant for displaying various re- programmable information or decorative patterns beneath the surface of the skin of a person or an animal. A biologically inert subcutaneous implant is constructed of a flexible mate- rial so as to conform to the skin's surface. The subcutaneous implant includes a battery for providing power to the im- plant. The subcutaneous implant also includes a receiver for receiving programming information from a user, and a dis- play for displaying the programming information through the skin. Inventors: Singer, Andrew J. (Palo Alto, C A); White, Sean (San Francisco, CA). Implant in human brain makes workable computer connection An American scientist has entered the world of science fiction by implanting electrodes in the brains of disabled people so that they can control a computer by the power of thought. The implants have enabled two paralysed people to move the cursor on the screen simply by thinking about moving part of their body. They were able to convey messages such as \"I'm thirsty\" or \"please turn off the light\" by pointing the cursor at different icons. The hope is that eventu- ally patients will be able to communicate complex ideas just by thinking about them. \"If you can run a com- puter, you can talk to the world,\" said Dr Ray Bakay of Emory University in Atlanta, whose team developed the implants. A number of laboratories around the world are working on brain implants, but the only devices licensed for use so far are bionic ears for the profoundly deaf, and chips which can control the tremor caused by Parkinson's disease. The Emory implants go much further. They con- sist of two hollow glass cones, each the size of a ballpoint pen tip, placed into the brain's motor cortex, which controls body movements. The cones are cov- ered in chemicals extracted from the patient's knees that encourage nerve growth. Once installed, nerve cells grow into the cones and attach themselves to tiny electrodes inside. The location of each cone is determined by monitoring the patient's brain, using scanners and identifying the most active regions. Once the cones are in place and surrounded by nerve cells, the patient is asked to think about moving some part of the body, and signals from the electrodes are picked up by a small transmitter-receiver, amplified, and used to control a computer. Depending upon which nerves grow into the cones, each patient may have to think about moving a different part of the body to achieve the same effect. They are trained by listening to a buzzer which be- comes faster and louder when they are thinking along the right lines. Dr. Bakay says that controlling the cur- sor soon becomes second nature. He has secured funding from the US National Institutes of Health to continue the research with three more patients. The British Telecom laboratories near Ipswich have also done research into implantable chips, includ- ing a possible memory chip which would take data from the eye and store it for a computer. \"There is a raft of wonderful benefits to bringing chips and circuits in- side human beings,\" said Dr Peter Cochrane, head of research."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal November 1998 Page? Art Bell hangs it up- but may be back in November Art Bell, whose nationwide radio talk show \"Coast to Coast\" has attracted a devoted audience of an estimated 15 million UFO enthusiasts, resigned on the air Oct. 13 in a sudden farewell to listeners and, apparently, his employer. At this writing (Oct. 22), he was still not back on the air. Jacor Communications, Inc., distributer of Bell's shows through Premiere Radio Network of Los Angeles, says it will continue the program, airing the \"best of Art Bell\" until further notice. The following was posted on UFO Update by Keith Rowland, Webmaster, on Oct. 19: Art gives us an update on the situation which was played from tape on Monday night's program. He said: i \"Greetings to you from the Kingdom of Nye. Tuesday morning Oct. 13 without prior notice to any- body, without being advised or pressured by anyone, I resigned my position as host of this program. I did it for the reasons I gave then, because of a terrible life- threatening event which occured to my family about a year ago, as well as events subsequent to it. Although there is, and I want to be sure you understand this, no immediate danger to my family. \"What did occur then absolutely requires my full-time attention now. And to not give it right now, would surely be negligent and neglectful of those I love. Also to disclose details of what did occur, would have a rather immediate negative effect on my family and I will not do that. \"Several news organizations, broadcast and print media, have uncovered what went on. So far, perhaps because of legal ramifications or one might hope ethical behavior on their part, they've chosen not to proceed with the story. For this I'm very thankful. Of course as soon as I can, if the story breaks, and I will not be the one to break it, I will discuss it with you. I'll tell you all about it. You know developing this program, over the past 14 years, has been one of the great joys of my life. And you should know I miss it terribly. \"I'd like to sincerely thank everybody who has sent their heartfelt support to me. And there are many of you. Since my resignation, my network has been doing their very best to help resolve the situation; frankly on the night I resigned, I thought it could not be resolved. Now, I hope it can. Allowing me to return to what I love doing so much! But I need more time. While I can't discuss what in fact did occur, I can say this-It certainly was not a publicity stunt or contract ploy as rumored by my competitors and detractors. It is real and serious. This should become self-evident to you when you know, and you will know. On Oct. 22, Dennis William Hauck posted the following on UFO Update: I have just talked with Ramona Bell (Art's wife), and we have rescheduled my Art Bell \"Dreamland\" show for Sunday, Nov. 8, 1998. Art will return as host of the show. Ramona told me what they have been going through has been very difficult for everyone concerned, but they want to get on with things and continue with the show. She said only that what had happened was personal for Art and that he would divulge full details shortly. As of 10:00 PST today, she told me, I was only the second person on the planet to know this. *(Dennis W. Hauck is a former editor of the MUFON UFO Journal.)

The rotating Earth generates a magnetic field, thought to result from the spinning of the molten liquid outer core. Strongly influenced by the Sun's magnetic field, the geomagnetic field continually fluctuates. So- lar storms generate an enormous increase in geomag- netic activity. This fluctuating activity, which is mea- sured in three-hour periods by observatories around the world, is averaged into a global geomagnetic ac- tivity index and published by NOAA in Boulder, CO. ESP More than twenty studies 1 in the past ten years have established a highly significant link between low global geomagnetic activity and days when spontane- ous ESP happens most often. We hypothesize that the human mind expands consciousness into another di- mension to obtain psychic information most easily when the barrier of geomagnetic activity is low. High geo- magnetic activity during magnetic storms would block access to other dimensions, thus limiting psychic abil- ity. Physicist James Spottiswoode, research direc- tor of Cognitive Sciences Laboratory in Palo Alto, CA, analyzed thousands of laboratory remote viewing ESP trials and discovered a highly significant link between low geomagnetic activity and high ESP performance. The lower the geomagnetic activity, the better the ESP- during a two-hour window around a certain sidereal time (13.5 h local sidereal time), which improves the ESP results by a factor of four. (Sidereal time is rela- tive to the stars and advances a few minutes each day around the world.) 2 UFOs, aliens, and Bigfoot Though he is skeptical about UFOs and aliens, Spottiswoode has generously lent his expertise in geo- magnetic analyses to our explorations.

Our preliminary findings with a total of 224 sighting dates and times of 94 alien sightings (1977-1996), 73 UFO sightings (1957-1977), and 57 Bigfoot sightings (1973-1995) give overall odds against chance of 3,000 to 1 for our extra-dimensional hypoth- esis. Overall, negative geomagnetic shifts occur 71% of the time (12% above chance). Chance, as determined by computer analysis of all days in the years of our analyses, is 59.2%. The effect is strongest in recent years (1992-1996), occurring 84% of the time (25% above chance). Perhaps the most surprising result of our analy- sis was finding that Bigfoot sightings do not occur at random relative to global geomagnetic activity, as would be expected if he were merely a hard-to-find Earth dweller. Instead, the 57 sightings (1973-1995) from John Green 3 and Bigfoot Co-op 4 occur signifi- cantly more often - 77% of the time (18% above chance) - during times of negative geomagnetic shifts from the day before. Accompanying physical evidence rules out the counter-hypothesis that people are hav- ing hallucinations or seeing phantoms. Illusions don't leave long trails of deeply-embedded tracks thrice the size of a man's foot. There's little doubt the creatures known col- lectively as Bigfoot are real, and after forty years and more than 4,000 documented sightings nationwide, the gentle giants continue to prowl the woodlands of North American unimpeded.

Others describe the creatures' sudden disappear- ance in a flash.of light or nearby humming and eerie sounds, or the presence of hovering UFOs. The major- ity of researchers ignore these cases. We believe these thorns in the side of conventional research constitute the single most significant clue to the true origin of Bigfoot. It is our contention that Bigfoot is a visitor from elsewhere. For comparison with Bigfoot we examined claimed sightings of aliens, which have an advantage over UFO sightings in that they are unlikely to be con- fused with natural phenomena. Claimed alien sightings (1977-1996), of which over 75% are accompanied by landed UFO craft, were taken from Larry Hatch's UFO Database 5 and divided into two groups: 40 multiple-witness and 54 single-witness dates. We felt that multiple-witness sightings of aliens would show a stronger effect than single-witness sightings, and this proved to be true. Multiple-witness alien sightings oc- curred significantly more often during times of nega- tive geomagnetic shifts, at 74% (15% above chance). Single-witness sightings were not significant, with only 63% (4% above chance) having a negative shift. Con- sensual reporting of sighting times by multiple wit- nesses is more reliable than that of a single witness. Perhaps our best sighting data are multiple-witness UFO sighting dates published 20 years ago in a report that inspected the sighting dates and times for possible geophysical effects 6 A database of 60,000 UFO reports was sifted to obtain 73 with pre- cise reporting times, multiple-witnesses, long duration, and other criteria. These 73 sightings (1957-1977) had been carefully reviewed by a committee of the Center for UFO Studies (CUFOS). Our analysis showed that a significant number of the sighting periods-70% (11% above chance)-had negative geomagnetic shifts from the day before. This data pushed our odds against chance from an initial 500 to 1 to 3,000 to 1 for our hypothesis. Future Research We plan additional research for a book on The Increasing Alien Presence to determine if our hypoth- esis-the first scientifically testable theory of the origin of UFOs-will give even greater evidence that UFOs and the alien presence come from extra-dimensional worlds of a hidden universe.

Pilot sighting near Memphis By Walter Andrus MUFON received an e-mail message on Sept. 9, 1998, from Capt. David Bertrand of Capital Cargo International Airlines that he and his crew observed a UFO near Memphis, TN, on July 28, 1998. They had departed Bergstom (Austin, TX) at 5:05 (1005Z), fly- ing a B-727 (aircraft number N128NA) for a nonstop flight to Philadelphia, PA, where they arrived at 0933 EDST(1333Z). At approximately 6:20 a.m. (1120Z), Capt. Bertrand, First Officer Dwight Howell, and Flight En- gineer Steve Franks watched an egg-shaped black ob- ject at their 12 o'clock position and same altitude, 33,000 feet, about 40 nautical miles west of Memphis, TN. The only clouds in the area were at their 2 to 3 o'clock position with an overcast layer starting about 100 nm in front of them. The sky above was clear of clouds. The object was about the size of Capt. Bertrand's index finger nail (in comparison) and seemed to be stationary and not changing in size as they proceeded in the object's direction at approxi- mately mach .82. The sun was not in their eyes, be- cause of the distant and high overcast weather that blocked the rising sun. Initially, Bertrand brought it to the attention of his crewmembers. His First Officer said that he had been watching the object and wondering what it was. His Flight Engineer observed the object as it began to (in their opinion) vaporize, leaving a misty, or smoky, image, with what appeared to be a puff of outer ring (light grey) smoke, or visible moisture that eventually faded from view. It had no wings or visible tail assem- blies and just appeared to be somewhat egg-shaped, but mostly resembled an airship (blimp) that was a grey- ish black color. The image shape remained as it ap- peared to fade out, leaving a fading grey color. It is unknown why they did not report the sight- ing to the ARTCC, West Memphis High Altitude Sec- tor. Capt. Bertrand is at a loss to explain why his Flight Engineer now says that he didn't see it. His First Of- ficer, Dwight Howell, acknowledged later that Steve Franks did in fact see the object. Bertrand explained the reason for his delayed report to MUFON. He said, \"I watched the TNT pre- sentation on television about UFO secrecy within the KGB and saw the same objects as seen by the MIG camera footage of the two disk-shaped objects that left a puff of smoke in their trail. I thought that you might be interested in this report.\" In his report, he added: (Continued on Page 17)"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal November 1998 Page 11 New York hot spot The Rise and Fall of Pine Bush By Scott C. Carr America's most uncelebrated UFO hot spot first came into the public perception in 1987 when it was mentioned in passing in Dr. J. Allen Hynek, Philip Imbrogno and Robert Pratt's Night Siege: The Hudson Valley UFO Sightings. Though Pine Bush played only a minor role in the Hudson Valley UFO flap of the mid-1980s, it was just outside of; Westchester and Putnam counties, where the bulk of the sightings were taking place. The Pine Bush sightings, however, would continue to grow, both in number and frequency. Action picking up Even as reports of the Hudson Valley's much publicized \"Westchester Wing\" or \"Westchester Boo- merang\" began to diminish after reaching a peak of nearly two thousand sightings between 1983 and 1987, just next door, in the Wallkill River valley area of neigh- boring Orange County, Pine Bush was becoming more and more active with unexplained phenomenon of its own. This tiny rural farming community began to at- tract first the attention of curious and perplexed locals, then quickly the attention of other outsiders and seri- ous investigators. In 1991, Ellen Crystall, a resident of New Jer- sey, published Silent Invasion, chronicling her eleven- year investigation into the mysterious activities sur- rounding Pine Bush. For the most part, unfortunately, the book fell on deaf ears. Many UFO enthusiasts scoffed at CrystalPs reports of seeing up to a dozen strange craft in the sky at once, landing in and rising out of fields, often at close range, sometimes merely a stone's throw away. Still others remained skeptical of the unconvincing photographs which accompanied the book. These photographs are unclear, Crystall explains in her book, due to intentional magnetic or microwave disruption focused on the camera/film by the aliens in order to \"camouflage\" their craft and to protect their anonymity.\" Attracting attendion But even though it was overlooked by the me- dia and mainstream UFO culture, Pine Bush did begin to slowly attract attention. PM Magazine did a seg- ment (and many years later Sightings and Strange Universe would visit), and Ellen Crystall embarked on a short-lived talk show jaunt on Joan Rivers, Geraldo, and People Are Talking. She brought Omni Magazine staffers out into the fields to see the strange lights for themselves. She took thousands of photo- graphs. But for the most part, Pine Bush continued to go unnoticed. For the few who did notice, and were curious About the author Scott C. Carr is the editor of The Flying Sau- cer Gazette, a monthly magazine dedicated to look- ing at the UFO phenomenon from a sociological per- spective. He is also the producer and co-host of \"UFO Desk,\" a weekly radio show featured on 99.5 FM, WBAI, NY. Carr is a professional writer, and is currently seeking publication for \"Incident at Sardonica,\" a novel concerning the UFO culture. enough to journey to the small town to see for them- selves, Pine Bush proved intriguing enough to bring them back again and again. A small, eclectic group of eccentric investigators and dedicated sky watchers began to form, returning regularly to the mysterious fields and backroads. And the phenomenon itself was becoming stranger all the time, and harder to define. Reports of lights in the sky abounded back then. Phantom beings and strange animal sightings were not uncommon. Mechanical rumblings from deep under- ground were often heard. Farmers reported seeing strange lights over their fields at night, only to discover large sections of earth had been moved, as if by trac- tors, the next morning. Warm gusts of air were felt blow- ing from out of the woods, even on the coldest of nights. Strange white orbs of light (affectionately referred .to as \"Tesla Globes\") and intrusive red mist began to ap- pear regularly in photographs, though nothing was seen when the pictures were actually taken. Abduction phenomenon The abduction phenomenon was spreading like wildfire throughout the country, and Pine Bush was no exception. Abductees began to come forward. They organized meetings, formed support groups, and planned excursions into the fields to go sky watching, or \"UFOing\" as the locals have termed their nocturnal pastime. And Whitley Strieber was still half a decade from admitting that much of his own experience, eerily and starkly described in his best-selling Communion, did in fact take place in his cabin outside Pine Bush- though rumors abounded among the small, yet grow- ing, group of sky watchers who gathered almost nightly on West Searesville Road. Even as the core group of locals continued to watch the skies, keeping to themselves and eschewing all newcomers and outsiders, the number of interested people making the sojourn to the small farming com- munity continued to grow, until by 1995 you could find a line of cars parked along West Searesville Road on virtually any night, weather permitting. Dedicated UFO enthusiasts would gather to discuss the paranormal, fling wild theories, and watch odd lights dart about the skies. It was this ever growing, evolving group of people who began to define the personality of Pine"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"Page 12 November 1998 MUFON UFO Journal Bush. While some of them were genuinely deluded, seeing UFOs and conspiracies everywhere, some were quite level-headed, bringing new investigative talent and insight into the field. Some were skeptical, some were convinced, but all were inexplicably drawn to this place for no reason other than to gaze up at the night sky, up to the stars, hoping against hope to catch a glimpse of the unknown. Cornet on scene In the Summer of 1992, Crystall was contacted by Dr. Bruce Cornet, a geologist who, after reading Silent Invasion, felt compelled to visit Pine Bush. By this time, the first signs of encroaching urban develop- ment in the area were becoming evident, as civiliza- tion began to close in on the rural hot spot. Ms. Crystall's own investigation was winding down, and she began to frequent the area less and less. Dr. Cor- net, on the other hand, could be found almost on a regu- lar basis, and was initiating an investigation of his own. He conducted magnetic and geologic surveys of the area, and came to some rather startling conclusions. Cornet claimed to have discovered underground trans- mitters sending polarized magnetic photon beams up into space. His theories went on to become even more eso- teric. He boasted frequent close encounters and inter- action with extraterrestrial craft which he called TLPs (Transient Luminescent Phenomenon), as opposed to the more generic term UFOs. He claimed telepathic communication with the entities behind the phenom- enon, and believed that they were gradually educating him, slowly revealing their presence and intentions in a way that he could handle on an intellectual level. Continued urbanization • As Dr. Cornet continued to immerse himself in the Pine Bush phenomenon, the increasing urban- ization of the area began to seriously threaten\"the sanc- tity of the sky watchers. New homes were popping up everywhere, and with them, \"No Trespassing\" and \"Pri- vate Property\" signs appeared in places that-had tradi- tionally been open to sky watching. By the end of 1996, sightings had reached an all time low, and Dr. Cornet's theories were becoming more unorthodox. Hotels, restaurants, banks, and con- venience stores began to appear, almost overnight, and Dr. Cornet announced his belief that, according to his most recent geologic studies, the entire Wallkill River valley area was an exact scale replica.of the Martian landscape Cydonia, home of the infamous and much alleged \"Face\" and \"Pyramid.\" He dubbed Pine Bush \"Cydonia II,\" while police began to quietly patrol the once quiet backroads, courteously asking sky watch- ers to keep it down, or to please find somewhere else to park. The Pine Bush saga was at an all time low. And then, on May 17, 1997, Dr. Cornet, along with Marc Whitford and Dinah Bertran, recorded on high eight video the flight of a mysterious black tri- angle at close range. In a time when Pine Bush was going through an inordinate paranormal dry spell, this was a much needed reaffirmation of the existence of a true enigma. Though not necessarily supportive of any of the particular theories or wild speculations that had cropped up during the phenomenon's recession, this was a refreshing confirmation of the persistence and faith of the dedicated sky watchers. This faith and dedication would soon be put to the test, however. Just as sightings and reports of strange lights and phenomenon began once again to pick up pace-with a renewed vigor not seen in nearly five years-so did the continued urban development. New homes along West Searesville threatened issues of freedom and privacy. It was not long before the new residents of these homes began to take notice of the men and women outside, staring up into the star filled sky, searching for flying saucers. Conflict inevitable Conflict was inevitable as, for the first time, the general public confronted the UFO culture on com- mon, neutral ground. For the first time, public percep- tion of the UFO phenomenon is taking place on a per- sonal level, free from the sensational glamorization of the media. This is a unique, unprecedented occurrence, and the sociological implications are fascinating. Only human culpability and open-minded understanding will determine the future of UFO watching in Pine Bush. As of January of this year, sky watching has been banned in Orange County. Though the legalities of this are uncertain at the time of this writing, appar- ently anyone found guilty of trespassing or parking with the intention of \"sky watching\" will be subject to in- carceration and/or fine. Many of the researchers and sky watchers of the area have moved their efforts to the mysterious and enigmatic Wanaque, NJ, where they claim to experience many bizarre sightings and \"inter- dimensional phenomenon.'•' They have dubbed it \"The New Pine Bush.\" Sainio looking for inverted T\\ipperware MUFON Photoanalyst Jeff Sainio says he is analyzing \"a very interesting video case,\" and won- ders if anybody has investigated a case of a hovering inverted Tupperware bowl with a lighted bottom rim July 11, 1998, over the Akron area?\" It was reportedly observed for ten minutes in a populated area, so there is a good possibility of other witnesses.

Strange craft were seen almost nightly flying over Vermont either east to west or from west to east. Apparently two very short video segments were taken of the craft. They were shot with a rather old (1988) video camera that requires 7 lux so the most we can estab- lish with the video is that the lights on the craft are exception- ally bright. When I receive DK's report I will forward it as well. There were six witnesses to one sighting. There have been a couple of other witnesses that have not been interviewed yet. Some of the craft appeared to be diamond shaped. NEW JERSEY Brian Paul Calabrese writes that \"in the fall of 1995,1 was driving westbound on New Jersey Route 70 around 1 a.m. when I noticed that the forest seemed to be on fire. I looked in the direction of the light, and saw something coming down at a reasonably slow pace. It was bright orange, almost like me color of a camp- fire, and was lighting up the entire area. \"Realizing, this was a UFO, I pulled over and got out of the car and watched it land. When it got around twenty feet off the ground, the light changed to blue, and then the light went out. I looked around for any ET's, then got in my car and went home. I regret not having stayed.\" Thanks to Larry Clark, Note: We have frequent reports of UFOs along this highway that happens to mark the southern edge of the huge Fort Dix Army Base. GEORGIA John Thompson writes that he and several oth- ers are investigating a September sighting where the two separate witnesses have drawn pictures of a UFO. A LaGrange woman and her daughter moved to Norcrosse just north of Atlanta and saw a UFO. They had also been witnesses to UFOs in the past when they lived in LaGrange about 60 miles to the southwest. Both witnesses drew a sketch. I've compared the two witness drawings. WOW! Pretty close match, I'd say. The witness' de- scription of shape as drawn is similar, but the draw- ings are slightly different in terms of the angle of the \"arms\" of the boomerang. This could be a simple re- sult of the angle of viewing relative to the object's tra- jectory. The UFO was generally level and flew directly away from their position. This would make the shape logical for a boomerang-shaped object. The apparent size was five inches at about 30 degrees above hori- zon. The craft was lost behind some trees. The sight- ing occurred at 8 p.m., the sky was dark, and object was translucent, with \"distorted\" edges that distorted stars but did not block them. The size and distance to the object was difficult for the witnesses to estimate, but the overall impression was that it was low, big, and not too distant.

On Sept 26, 1998, between 9 and 10 p.m. local time, three bright white lights were observed to linger one- third above the horizon over the Pacific Ocean. The lights, eAcept for a few brief seconds of flashing, were otherwise non-blinking and stationary for nearly 35 minutes before flying away. On leaving, they moved laterally with the Mexi- can coastline and took about five minutes to move out of sight. Within a few minutes the three lights \"streaked\" back to near where they had originally been seen at and began lingering again. According to a wit- ness in one of the American retirement communities there, the strange lights are seen frequently in the sum- mer months of the year. Frequency of sightings varies from \"4 to 6 times\" in summer to only once or twice in the winter. A retired American college astronomer who has often seen the lights, said they are not heavenly bodies or planes and he is at a loss to explain what they are. The Mexican lights are capable of great speeds and linger for long periods of time. The 9/26/98 lights had an apparent size of slightly less than Jupiter. Thanks to John C. Thompson Copyright, 1998.

Durbec, a postal service employee and a union shop steward, called the MUFON Hotline (1- 800-UFO-2166) at 8:07 a.m. POST on Oct. 20, 1998, to report a possible UFO sighting. He was driving on 1-84 between 122nd Ave. and 223rd Ave. in Gresham, OR, when he observed a disk-shaped object fly from the south to the north behind Mt. Hood (see drawing by Mr. Durbec). Mt. Hood's elevation is 11,239 feet, the highest point in Oregon. It is about 35 miles east- southeast of Mr. Durbec's viewing point. Mr. Durbec states: \"I spotted what appeared to be a cloud at 7:50 a.m. on Oct. 20, 1998, just to the south of Mt. Hood. What caught my eye was the light, glinting off the top of the object. Winds were from the south because I could see snow or clouds (very, very light) drifting off the top of the volcano in a rooster tail-like shape. The object passed behind the moun- tain. I saw it approximately four minutes later to the north of the volcano. I lost it in the sun and spotted it further north of the volcano approximately two min- utes later. I lost it in the sun again at 7:56 a.m. and did not reacquire it. Mr. Durbec faxed MUFON a copy of his dis- charge papers from active duty in the U.S. Army, and his top secret security clearance as evidence of his cred- ibility. Astronaut Mitchell calls for government to acknowledge UFO cover-up Apollo 14 astronaut Dr. Edgar Mitchell, speak- ing at the UFO Experience Conference in North Ha- ven, CT, Oct. 11 called on Congress to grant immunity to officials who have taken oaths of secrecy so they can acknowledge the existence of UFOs and aliens. Dr. Mitchell, who received his doctorate from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, says he is 90 percent sure that many of the UFOs observed over the years belong to aliens. He notes that \"this suggests there are humanoids manning craft which have char- acteristics not in the arsenal of any nation on Earth.\" Dr. Mitchell, the sixth man to walk on the moon, says his contacts in intelligence agencies and the military have convinced him that the government has covered up the truth about UFOs for 50 years. He adds that one example is the crash of what he feels was an extraterrestrial craft in New Mexico in 1947. Walter Andrus, Jr., International Director of the Mutual UFO Network, says, \"When someone of Ed Mitchell's stature makes statements regarding UFOs and government secrecy, this raises the stature of the entire field of ufology.\""},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal November 1998 Page 15 Work continues on message that Gen* Ramey holds in hand By George Filer MUFON Eastern Regional Director As you might be aware, several of us have de- ciphered much of the note Gen.

The \"translation\" was performed independently at at least two locations and achieved an outstanding de- gree of correlation.

The file from which I worked is a scanned im- age of solely the message, and is 821 megabytes (this from an approximate I\" x 3/8\" image size!). Because of the differing image intensities, we were required to vary the brightness and contrast of different areas of the image to best resolve the individual characters. Translation took three to four hours. Several factors assisted us. First, it was a nonproportional type, mean- ing each character and space occupied the same amount of space (unlike today's ever-popular proportional type); Second, all the letters are upper-case; third we had large-format images. Fourth, today's equipment is sufficiently capable to enable us to perform this task. Bond and I presented the preliminary results to an excited audience at MUFON Orange County's monthly meeting. The highlight of the presentation was enabling the audience to actually READ some elements of this hithertofore \"hidden\" message.

After hearing rustling in the brush, James Harmon shined his flashlight toward the noise. The beam struck what he and Tim Ford describe as a very large furry creature which stood upright, with \"arms hanging way past its knees.\" The creature was about 50 yards away. The two men reportedly found footprints measuring 20 inches long and 6 inches wide. Harmon and Ford were with five other indi- viduals on a fishing and hunting trip, and they said that nobody in their group had been drinking or using drugs. There was no indication as to whether the other five individuals saw the creature, which reportedly kept its distance, but let out eerie screams periodically through- out the night.

When Congressional pressure led to a review of the Air Force Project Blue Book study in 1966, via a contract lo the University of Colorado, Hall was in- vited to be a consultant to the Colorado Project. The Project director, Dr. E.U.Condon, recommended Hall to the Encyclopedia Britannica for a |%S Yearbook article on UFOs. Hall is an Executive Committee member and past chairman of the Fund for UFO Research in Wash- ington, D.C., and is author of Uninvited Guests: A Documented History of UFO Sightings, Alien Encoun- ters & Cover-Ups (Aurora Press, 1988). This book has recently gone into a second English-language printing and is also in Japanese, Hungarian, Polish, German, and Hebrew editions. In 1992 Hall served on the Pro- gram Committee for a groundbreaking conference on UFO abduction cases held at the Massachusetts Insti- tute of Technology. Extensive writings He has written extensively on the subject of UFOs, including several entries in the Doubleday Ency- clopedia of UFOs (1980). He was a consultant to Time-Life Books on Alien Encounters (1992), and has been a frequent interviewee on the Paramount programs \"Sightings\" and \"Paranormal Borderline\" (1995-1997). He is also featured in a 1997 Readers Digest video- tape documentary on UFOs and strange animals. Hall has, of course, witnessed many changes in the UFO field during the past 40 years, including a significant shift in emphasis to abduction reports and studies. After working on more than 100 such cases Richard Hall himself, he concludes, \"The more I study .such cases, the less I know.\" Like Budd Hopkins, he feels there is a real danger to experiences when hypnosis is done by unqualified researchers. Unlike Hopkins, however, Hall has never gotten to the point where he feels comfort- able using hypnosis, prefer- ring to utilize relaxation tech- niques. He also feels that too much of the researcher is present in abductee cases. \"Regardless of how good you are as a hypnotist or re- searcher,\" he notes, \"most people who come to a well- known person in the field al- ready know what the re- searcher thinks, and there is a danger that the 'abductee' will respond accordingly. It is better if the hypnotist is ei- ther unknown to the 'abductee,' or not connected with UFO research, as in the Betty and Barney Hill case.\" While Hall sees abduction cases as important, he feels there has been too much emphasis on them, and that they are a drain on limited resources. \"The largely anecdotal data, filtered through the recollec- tions of obviously distraught and confused people, has been squeezed to the utmost without proving much of anything,\" he contends. Different conclusions \"Although the three leading researchers, Budd Hopkins, Ray Fowler, and David Jacobs, tend to agree on data,\" says Hall, \"their ultimate readings as to what is going on are very different. Furthermore, their theo- ries-in some cases presented as established fact-are not verifiable and, therefore, not very meaningful in the scientific sense. Maybe one or more of them is 'right,' but how will we ever know? The obvious mes- sage is that we need to theorize less and gather data more.\" Hall argues that \"the best basic UFO cases are still those that show something physical, such as ra- dar, physical traces, electromagnetic effects, and pho- tos.\" He contends that the systematic analysis of the best of these cases can yield information on such things as propulsion and other aspects of UFO physics. Among the current researchers who seem to be doing good work in physical traces, according to Hall, are Ted Phillips and the BLT team (John Burke, William"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal November 1998 Page 17 C. Levengood, and Nancy Talbott). Hall, who has done considerable work with photos, notes that UFO im- ages vary a great deal in quality and legitimacy. \"For example, I don't believe the Ed Walters photos are le- gitimate,\" he says, \"though other people in MUFON do.\" The better cases In discussing some of the better cases, Hall mentions the Socorro, NM, sighting involving police- man Lonnie Zamora, which featured physical traces, and the 1966 Ravenna, OH, sightings by a number of police officers, which had no physical traces. \"Although some people disagree,\" Hall notes, \"I still think mul- tiple witnesses are important in establishing a case.\" Asked about the Roswell incident, he says, \"Although there has been contamination of the witnesses, there is still a core of solid information there. Something crashed, and I'm sure it was not a balloon. I think we need to keep an open mind.\" Asked about the effects of 40 years of UFO research on his life, Hall has a simple answer: \"It has dominated my life and changed it completely. There have been wonderful experiences, and dreadful ones. It has definitely caused employment problems, and I finally quit mentioning anything about UFOs on my resume. I got tired of hearing, 'Oh, yeah, my wife throws flying saucers at me all the time.' Ufology still dominates my life.\" Hall has, however, expanded his interests and writing into other areas-including the Civil War-and is a member of the Author's Guild. His book Patriots in Disguise, about women who fought as soldiers on the Civil War battlefields, often disguised as men, was published in hard cover by Paragon House in 1993 and in quality paperback by Marlowe & Company in 1994. He has also written articles about the Civil War for various journals, and has contributed a chapter in a forthcoming book by a university press about Hispan- ics who served in the Civil War. Two of his articles have been adopted as chapters in history text books- one for a history course at the U.S. Air Force Acad- emy. Pilot sighting reported near Memphis... (Continued from Page 10) \"All three of us agreed that the object was unusual and not an aircraft in front of us, or any type of weather, i.e., cloud, smoke, or possibly a ground structure. There was no reflection, of light off the object. Bob Coddington (Richmond, VA), MUFON's most active e-mail operator, invited Capt. Bertrand to submit a detailed report by obtaining report forms from MUFON. To date we have not heard from the Captain. However, his narrative was so detailed, he probably felt there was nothing more that he could add. The UFO PRESS A Covert Agenda by Nicholas Redfern. Simon & Schuster. London. Reviewed by R. J. Durant America has produced such an avalanche of books, periodicals, movies and television programs on UFOs that it is easy to conclude that the topic is pecu- liar to this country. Nick Redfern's book is a powerful antidote to the \"made in U.S.A.\" persuasion. Reading Redfern is like picking up one of Donald Keyhoe's seminal volumes. He recounts a multitude of excellent sightings, including multiple witness and radar events that rival any reported in this country. Officialdom is shown time and again obscur- ing the facts, denying the undeniable, and invoking impossible explanations for those few cases that leaked into the public domain. Sounds familiar? It is, except that all of the action occurs in Britain. So obvious are the parallels with respect to the reaction of the American and British governments that one wonders if there is a common trans-Atlantic protocol for handling the UFO problem. That such li- aison exists on some level was discovered by the au- thor when he learned that his Freedom of Information Act requests to the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency were being routed through the British Ministry of De- fence! Britain has no equivalent to our Freedom of Information Act, and most of the UFO data unearthed by Redfern is covered by their sweeping Official Se- crets Act. Requests for information are answered or not at the whim of British intelligence bureaucrats. This made the research doubly difficult and time-consuming, and put many of Redfern's informants at risk. He opens the book with this statement: \"For almost half a century, you have been denied access to the facts which lie behind two discoveries of monu- mental proportions: Planet Earth has extra-terrestrial visitors, and unidentified flying objects exist. I do not make such claims lightly, nor do I expect the reader to accept those same claims on faith alone. Through the use of both official documentation and witness testi- mony, it is my hope that what you are about to read will conclusively prove that, since the late 1940s, Brit- ish governments have been acutely aware that our planet has been targeted for visitation by creatures from elsewhere.\" The \"conclusive proof is not quite there, but something close to it is the final effect of the densely written and scholarly work Redfern has turned out. This is not an \"easy read,\" but it will reward the serious ufologist."},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"Page 18 November 1998 MUFON UFO Journal Richard H. Hall Richard H. Hall on the October issue of the Journal From where I stand, the glass was either half full or half empty in October, depending on your . \"druthers.\" I was pleased to see real science being con- ducted, or advocated, in several pieces. Half full: Crop circles may or may not be related to UFOs, but the only rational way to find out is to conduct some science and to carefully sift through human tes- timony and evidence for clues. Also, Jeff Sainio's analysis of the now notorious 1997 Mexico City videotape certainly is a worthwhile contribution. And David Rapp engages in scien- tific dialogue concerning the \"Phoenix Lights\" of 1997. Half empty: Why do we use valuable Journal space on topics not KNOWN to be re- lated to UFOs? Aren't there enough clearly UFO-related questions to keep us oc- cupied? (From my past experience as editor, I think I know the answer: We need more articles from scien- tifically oriented investigators.) With respect to Cynthia Luce's article calling attention to other \"weird crea- ture\" reports, shouldn't we leave them to the cryptozoologists until a UFO connection is established, if there is one? And why waste time or space on the self-styled \"remote viewers,\" whose personal credibility leaves a lot to be desired? Anyone who is stupid enough to be- lieve Ed Dames' \"100% correct answers\" at face value ought to be automatically disqualified from MUFON membership. Remote viewing is a totally unproved methodology, even determined to be essentially value- less by its original investigators. It may or may not be touching on a sporadic \"parapsychological\" capability of some human beings. Adopting pseudo science does nothing to enhance Ufology. Segue into the Forum letter from Dr. Philip S. Duke. In the interest of full disclosure, he and I have clashed in so-far private correspondence. He asked me what I thought of his AIDS-ET connection, and I told him, whereupon he threatened to do various things to me. Rather than advance my specific arguments, just look at his own comments: His concept \"logically ex- plains all the known facts...there is no contradictory reliable evidence...therefore I present it as the truth.\" Well, pardon me all to hell! I have been a for- mal student of logic, and there is nothing like assum- ing all your own conclusions. His assumptions are very questionable and highly debatable at every level. Let's leave it at that for now, although I don't doubt we will be hearing more from Dr. Duke. If anything, his claims should be submitted to appropriate MUFON advisors for their analysis. The Cash-Landrum case, subject of Dwight Connelly's review, strikes me as one of those keystone cases in UFO lore. No matter how you look at it, there is a supremely important story there. And where are the high-powered investigative reporters when you need them? If, in fact, the flame-spewing, radiation-emit- ting craft that zapped innocent victims in December 1980 was a secret U.S. test device, illegally and clandestinely flying over populated areas far from the huge, highly secure western test sites for advanced air- craft, why are we being lied to? Why has our Govern- ment allowed the victims to suffer severe medical in- juries rather than to confess error and move on? And where is this alleged atomic-powered craft today, and what earthly good is it? On the other hand, if the object was not a U.S. test device, as seems more likely, what was it? The overwhelming human testimony leaves no doubt that a real craft of some kind irradiated its closest observ- ers with apparent ionizing radiation. Unfortunately for UFO advocates, the \"UFO\" never demonstrated ex- traordinary performance capabilities, like suddenly zooming away. But the far more important point is that no simple, benign answer exists. Something serious and highly important occurred. Such a case ought to stimu- late careful and thorough inquiry by scientists, investi- gative journalists, and high officials. But it doesn't be- cause (a) skeptics think they already know the answer (though they must not have thought through the logic of their position very carefully) and (b) UFO believers think they already know the answer. Thought of the month: Is anyone out there still humble enough to hold out for much more complete and vigorous investigation before drawing hard and fast \"final\" conclusions about UFO reports?Too many people seem to think they have all the answers. I've been at this for at least 40 years, and I still have far more questions than answers."},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal November 1998 Page 19 MUFON FORUM Journal Update on Aviano To the Editor: In 1996 I wrote the lead article for the Febru- ary issue of the MUFON UFO Journal entitled \"The Mystery of Aviano.\" The article dealt with the July 1, 1977, incident outside the Aviano AB, Italy, perimeter fence near the fighter alert (Victor Alert) facility at about 3 a.m. In the article, I interviewed an active duty eye- witness, giving him the alias of SMSgt Robert Frank. This was done to protect his privacy while he was still on active duty. The NCO involved in providing the tes- timony is currently in the process of retiring, and is allowing me at this time to publicize his name. The actual name for SMSgt Robert Frank is SMSgt Roger A. Furry, USAF Ret., who is retiring this year from active duty. Without SMSgt Furry's com- plete cooperation, the article would not have been pos- sible. I am a personal friend of SMSgt Furry, and while on active duty a professional colleague. Sgt. Furry was an outstanding USAF professional, and in 1992 he was awarded the Outstanding First Sergeant of the Year Award for Aviano Air Base, attesting to his exceptional leadership and dedication to duty. Additionally, in a letter to the editor in the April 1996 MUFON UFO Journal Mr. John S. Derr, Chief Global Seismograph Network, U.S. Dept. of the Inte- rior, Albuquerque, NM, stated that from his research he felt what SMSgt Furry and the other seventeen eye- witnesses likely observed was a spectacular display of a geophysical luminosity (earthquake light). I have per- sonally conducted three subsequent interviews with SMSgt Furry concerning this possible explanation. He consistently states that what he observed had a con- stant physical form structure within the light, that it was circular, and that it did not change in structure even when it started changing in color prior to its liftoff. As a young USAF security forces NCO at the time of the incident, Sgt. Furry was highly trained to be an ob- server of events. Knowing his overall professionalism, I must go with his interpretation of the object over Mr. Derr's. I want to thank Mr. Derr for his outstanding scientific interpretation, even though the subsequent interviews with SMSgt Furry do not bear out his hy- pothesis. If anyone wishes to correspond with SMSgt Furry, they may contact him through me by calling MUFON at (830) 379-9216. Gerald E. Rowles, Lt. Col. USAF Ret. MUFON State Director Washington State Debate over hybrids Dear Mr. Connelly, Are abductees seeing true hybrids or some- thing else? In biology, a hybrid is defined as an off- spring from genetically dissimilar parents, usually of two different species. In nature, hybridization can only occur between closely related species. However, be- cause all life on Earth shares the same genetic code, it is possible for scientists to create transgenic life forms possessing genes from two or more unrelated species. The process that gray aliens use to create \"hy- brids\" may be closer to that which our scientists use to create transgenic organisms than it is to true hybrid- ization (e.g., when a horse and donkey are crossed to produce a mule). We do not live in a Star Trek universe where humanoids from different planets can fall in love and have children. But it may be premature to say that the genetic code is purely arbitrary. Perhaps the laws of chemistry permit only a few variations on the terres- trial genetic code such that genes from anywhere in the universe would be essentially compatible. Alternatively, there may be a means of trans- lating between terrestrial and extraterrestrial genetic codes to create hyper-hybrids (see Dr. Gerald Eichhoefer's essay in Alien Discussions). We cannot be certain that the creation of interplanetary hybrids, hyper-hybrids, or whatever you want to call them, is impossible. Ideally, a ufologist should be familiar with the proper usage of terminology from a wide variety of conventional sciences, and also aware of how the use of scientific terms may differ from one field to another. This debate may depend as much on how we define a hybrid as it does on the genetic make-up of aliens. David W.

It's the opening act in NASA's New Millen- nium program. \"This is the first StarTrek-y thing that NASA has done,\" says Curt Cleven, deputy spacecraft sys- tems manager for Deep Space 1. \"It's the first time we're really try ing something out of the ordinary.\" The goal is to test technologies too new and risky to fly on science missions, yet which could lead to smaller, faster and cheaper spacecraft in the future. Twelve such tech- nologies will soar with the Deep Space 1 launch, which was untied for Oct. 25. Perhaps the most intriguing, and futuristic, are the ion-propulsion engine and autonomous navigation systems. \"These two technologies are like having your car find its own \"/ay from Washington, D.C., to Los Angeles, arrive at a designated parking space, and do it all while getting *00 miles per gallon,\" says Marc Rayman, chief engineer and deputy mission manager at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, CA. Rayman first heard about ion propulsion in a 1968 episode of \"Star Trek.\"An alien spacecraft uses advanced ion propulsion, impressing the crew of the faster-than-the-speed-of-lightstarship Enterprise. In the much slower real world, solar-powered ion engines are 10 times more efficient than traditional chemical en- gines. In other words, they require only one-tenth the amount of fuel, which allows for lighter spacecraft and therefore smaller (i.e. cheaper) launchers. A small Delta rocket costing a modest $43 million, for instance, will launch the 1,080-pound Deep Space I on its one- to three-year mission. The Delta's third stage will boost the spacecraft out of Earth orbit and put it on a perpetual sun-orbiting course. The ion engine, once it's running, will provide the extra kick needed for Deep Space 1 to meet up with asteroid 1992 KD next July. That extra kick will be light, yet long. The thrust of an ion engine is 10,000 times weaker than that gen- erated by typical interplanetary spacecraft. Hold a piece of paper, Rayman says, and that's how light the thrust of an ion engine would feel. The farther Deep Space 1 gets from the sun-which provides the power that drives the engine-the lower the thrust. Because of me con- stant acceleration, however, the spacecraft can zoom along at incredibly high speeds for years. \"It's what I like to call acceleration with pa- November 7-8, The 35ih Nauonal UFO Conference, Days Inn, Bordenion, New Jersey.

Adds Cleven, \"Ion propulsion, if it works-and we think it will-is a whole new way to get someplace a lot faster.\" The estimated 10-year trip to unexplored Pluto, for instance, could be reduced by at least a couple of years with ion propulsion. After an initial shakedown phase, Deep Space 1's motto will be: Don't call me, I'll call you. In the first such test, the spacecraft will find its own way to asteroid 1992 KD and attempt to pass within six miles of the two- to three-mile-diameter rock. Deep Space 1 will determine its place in the solar system by taking pictures of known asteroids and comparing their posi- tions to background stars. The orbits of 250 asteroids and the positions of 250,000 stars will be stored in its computer memory. What's more, Deep Space 1 will take charge of some of its own commanding, thanks to artificial intelligence in the autonomous navigation system, re- minding itself when to turn, take pictures and change the throttle settings, among other things. And in an- other experiment, the spacecraft will keep Earth posted on its health and whereabouts by periodically radioing back one of four tones."},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal November 1998 Page 21 PUBLICATIONS BY KATHARINA WILSON The Alien Jigsaw ($25.00) and The Researcher's Supplement ($15.00).

The gas giant can be seen near the Moon on the 24th. Saturn (0.2), in Pisces, stands in the SE at twi- light, proceeding westward after dark. The yellowish planet lies 20° above the gibbous Moon on Dec. 27. It resumes eastward orbital motion on the 30th. Bright Planets (Morning Sky): Mercury becomes visible around the middle of the month low in the ESE before sunrise. Use binocu- lars to locate the faint orange object. Mars (1.2), in Virgo, rises in the E near I a.m. in mid-December. The fading ruddy planet moves to a position at dawn high in the S. It is 2 degrees below the Moon on the 12th. Saturn sets in the W about 2:30 a.m. in midmonth. New Missions to Mars: This month and next the U.S. will send two more spacecraft to Mars. The first is Mars'Climate Obiter, designed to study the planet's temperature, pressure, dust, and water vapor for one Martian year (about two Earth years). Its companion, Mars Polar Lander, follows with a late 1999 touchdown on Mars to search for water below the planet's surface near the ^outh pole. The lander carries a camera, robot arm for digging up soil samples, and two subsurface penetrat- ing probes.

To those of us who are vitally involved, this presents an educational challenge via the print media, television, radio and our own or- ganizational programs. It would be futile to attempt to solicit the \"debunkers,\" since these relatively few people have already decided that UFOs do not exist. Unlike some foreign governments, such as Belgium, France and Brazil, that are actively support- ing UFO research, the United States Government (or agencies within the government) have continued to place roadblocks in the path of scientific study. In the past two years the USAF and CIA have published ex- tensive reports to explain away the crash at Roswell and the recovery of bodies with absurd explanations that no knowledgeable person would believe. I have personally speculated that this may be an intentional ruse to gradually release information after fifty years of lying, in order to \"save face.\" However, blaming the government for covering-up UFOs is only one of the problems that we face in gaining scientific respectability for the UFO enigma. The problems within the UFO com- munity are something that we can deal with inde- pendently of the government. Problems that ufologists have created are also detrimental to sci- entific acceptance of the UFO phenomenon by the academic and scientific communities. When we ad- .mit that the UFO Phenomenon is an enigmatic con- troversial subject, we are faced with unlimited opin- ions from within the UFO community. Constructive debate is a healthy outlet for resolving problems; however, there are individuals within ufology who take advantage of this fact to con- demn other people for their ideas if they do not agree with theirs. Discussing ideas and theories is a legiti- mate interaction; however, verbally castigating an in- dividual for his/her views is a form of cruel and inhu- man treatment and totally unacceptable. If our com- bined ultimate goal is to resolve this mystery, we must unite our efforts in a positive manner and not continue to attack people who differ from one's personal opin- ion. Policing the UFO community is a very difficult assignment when opportunists attempt to insert them- selves into a legitimate study for their anticipated per- sonal and financial gains. Unification in ufology has been demonstrated very successfully by the formation of the UFO Re- search Coalition composed of the Center for UFO Studies (CUFOS). the Fund for UFO Research (FUFOR) and the Mutual UFO Network (MUFON). Representatives of each organization have been meet- ing since 1994 to tackle difficult but essential projects to advance the scientific study of UFOs. Announce- ments on the different completed projects appear in IUR (International UFO Reporter), and the MUFON UFO JOURNAL. Supporting all three organizations is a form of unification that presently exists and is highly recommended. Individual ufologists nationwide are encouraged and invited to join either CUFOS or MUFON, or both, so their particular interest and re- search in ufology can be directed and combined with that of their colleagues. No single person is going to solve the UFO enigma. It will be done through an orga- nized and combined effort, backed by financial resources. We have made significant progress during the past thirty years; however, we have not achieved our ultimate goals and objectives. Let's unite and get the job done."},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"Page 24 November 1998 MUFON UFO Journal DIRECTOR'S MESSAGE WalterAnclrus NEWS FROM AROUND THE NETWORK NEW OFFICERS A professor at UAE University, Ross Lee Graham, Ph.D. (Al Ain) was appointed our Repre- sentative for the United Arab Emirates and a Consult- ant in Systems Theory. The following individuals were selected to be State Section Directors: Bruce M. Cordell, Ph. D. (Eureka, CA); Ernest T. Jahn, (Palmyra, VA), a veteran NICAP investigator: David W. Weaver, B.S. (San Antonio, TX); Roberta Puhalski, M.S. (Auburndale. FL), a member since 1991: Chris W. Brethwaite, B.S. (Kansas City. MO), also a member since 1991; and Antonia F. Rullan, M.B.A. (El Paso, TX), who joined MUFON in 1990. New Consultants this month are John W. Turner, J.D. (Columbia, MD) in Law, and Bruce M. Cordeli, Ph.D. (Eureka, CA) in Astronomy. Martha M. Calnen, M.A. (East Berlin. CT) volunteered as a Research Specialist in Theology. Russell Williams (Kempton, IN) recently passed the Field Investigator's Exam and was promoted to Field Investigator. VACANCIES ON BOARD OF DIRECTORS Next to resolving the UFO enigma, MUFON's second prime goal is educating the public on the UFO phenomenon. We have received two can- didates' applications for Director of Public Education, and additional applications are still being accepted. MUFON still has a vacancy for Membership Director on the Board to design programs to recruit new mem- bers and to maintain annual memberships. Candidates should send their resumes to Walt Andrus. In the meantime, John F. Schuessler, Deputy Director, Ad- ministration, is filling this role. LOCAL MUFON MEETINGS The \"grass roots\" organization of MUFON is unique compared to former UFO groups and other present day organizations in the UFO community. This has been our strength and assures our ability to per- form as a field investigator team worldwide. Local group meetings, chapters, section, and state meetings are the vehicles by which UFO information is shared and field investigator training is conducted. One of the more frequent questions that we receive on our MUFON UFO Hotline number concerns the location and place of MUFON meetings in the caller's area. It is fortunate that local chapter meetings are occurring in many major cities. However, as the recipient of these calls, I cannot provide the details, but must refer the caller to the nearest State or State Section Director. In most cases this is satisfactory. On our web-site on the Internet (mufon.com), we now list all of the State Directors, their addresses, and their telephone numbers as references and con- tacts. We want to expand upon this service by provid- ing a list of the statewide MUFON meetings by date, place, and time they are conducted on a scheduled ba- sis. As an example: the San Antonio. TX, section meets the fourth Tuesday of each month at 7 p.m. at the UTF Bookstore at North Blanco and Oblate Streets. The Austin, TX, section meets on the fourth Saturday of each month at 3 p.m. at the Quarry Library in North- west Austin off the MOPAC Highway. Every group that meets on a repetitive sched- ule, whether it is weekly, monthly, bi-monthly, or quar- terly, should provide this information to Walt Andrus in Seguin, TX. so such a list may be entered on our web site. This will be an asset to potential new mem- bers and especially vacationers who are traveling. At the same time, this could be the motivation to organize regular meetings in places where they are not currently being held. So far, we have heard only from Mel Podell, who heads up the San Diego Chapter of MUFON, where they meet bi-monthly with a speaker. NOMINATIONS FOR WESTERN REGIONAL DIRECTOR The term of Mrs. Marilyn H. Childs, M.S. (Bothell. WA) as the Western Regional Director will ex- pire early in 1999. Marilyn and her husband Larry pro- vided the leadership for the very successful MUFON 1995 UFO Symposium in Seattle, WA. Through her many con- tacts. Marilyn has been instrumental in promoting MUFON in the public education arena. She will not run for a second term because of the need to be gainfully employed again. MUFON will regretfully miss her talent on the board of directors. (Continued on Page 23)"}]
