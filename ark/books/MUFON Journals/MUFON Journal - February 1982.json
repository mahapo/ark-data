FROM THE EDITOR The news that the National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena (NICAP) has, in effect, been acquired by the Center for UFO Studies (CUFOS) is particularly poignant for me as the former Assistant director of NICAP. It is welcome news (see my article in this issue). MUFON, CUFOS, APRO, CAUS, and the Fund for UFO Research (which resists using the acronym FUFOR) increasingly lead the way in United States UFO research, constantly developing closer bonds in a cooperative effort to tackle the sticky problem of UFOs. This is a good trend, considering the state of the economy and the fact that money to support UFO research is spread very thin. We look forward to further consolidations and mutual cooperation, nationally and inter- nationally.

Allen Hynek and Paul Cerny, Western States Director) Two different nighttime sightings of a similar or the same aerial object were made by a young pilot based in the Novato, Calif., area on November 5, 1980 and August 8, 1981. The first took place over the northern portion of Lake Berryessa E by NE of Novato .in Napa County, and approximately 50 miles due north of Oakland. The second, on the night of August 8, 1981, was encountered near San Luis reservoir in the western section of. Merced County, about 45 miles southeast of San Jose in the lower bay area. Both sightings were at night as the young pilot was returning to home base in the Novato area from charter flights. Both times he was alone in a single engine low-wing Piper aircraft. I have known the pilot for years. He was a student of mine in both the 8th and 9th grades for Physical Science and Earth Science. He was fly- ing gliders as a 9th grader and was an outstanding student. He now has over 2,000 hours of flying and is a flight in- structor. He wishes to have his name withheld because he wants to get a job with the airlines and feels that if his name is used it will hinder his chances of getting a job. He is almost 20 years of age. The pilot is a person of outstanding character and I have absolutely no reason to disbelieve him. During the first interview I had an observer, a non-believer in UFOs, who stated that she believed what the pilot had said. The character of the pilot, the ac- celeration changes observed, and the unusual appearance of the UFO make this an outstanding case. The pilot had little knowledge of the UFO phenom- ena prior to these experiences, thus adding more credibility to the unusual characteristics and maneuvers that he observed, plus the elec- tromagnetic (E-M) effects on his air- craft navigation and radio equipment in the second sighting. Sighting No. 1 The first encounter took place at 9:30 p.m. P.S.T. on November 5, 1980, over the northern part of Lake Berryessa near Lake Intersection of V-87 flight path (aircraft navigation maps). At the witness's request for anonymity, we will call him John Taylor. John was returning from Chico, Calif., from the north on a heading almost due south at about 8,000 feet and was flying IFR (Instrument Flight Rules) even though it was clear all around him. There was an overcast area off his left wing to the east at roughly 12,000 feet. Scanning the sky around him for other aircraft, as any good pilot does, he spotted a light at his 7:30 o'clock position. He called Oakland FAA Center and asked if another aircraft was near his position. Oakland Center informed him they knew of no other aircraft at that loca- tion and nothing showed on radar. The light seemed to be 3 to 5 miles away. Shortly after the radio exchange with Oakland, the light began to in- crease in intensity and he realized it was rapidly approaching him. It moved parallel to his 9:00 o'clock position, pacing him off his left wing at a distance of about a half mile. It stayed there for 15 to 20 seconds dur- ing which time Taylor managed to get a good look at his.visitor in the dark night sky. Taylor did not recall seeing the moon out that night, possibly due to the partial 12,000 foot overcast and his close attention to the UFO. What he saw was an elongated tear-drop-shaped orange glowing ob- Dr. Hynek and Pilot Witness ject extremely streamlined, smooth, and bullet shaped at the nose. The rounded nose area was glowing and pulsing a vivid orange. The pulse rate was once or twice a second. The rest of the main body and tapered end were a constant glow of a lighter orange. The most unusual feature of the strange craft was a spinning ring of red, blue, and white light that was whirling around the main body just behind the base area of the bullet nose portion, as if it were an almost invisible propeller spinning at high speed (see sketch). No other details or features, such as windows or protru- sions were discernible. The ring speed would increase as the UFO ac- celerated. The object then increased in color and brightness at the same time shooting forward to about 3 miles ahead of Taylor's plane at unbe- lievable speed. It then made a tight vertical right angle turn without slow- ing and shot straight upward at tremendous speed, disappearing from sight in about 5 seconds. During its initial acceleration away from Taylor's aircraft, the object went through a rapid shape transformation. The object changed from its clearly defined outline to a glowing bright ' (continued on next fiiye)"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Ringed UFO, Continued ball of orange light in roughly 3 seconds before it ascended vertically and disappeared. Alongside Taylor's plane, the object appeared to be ap- proximately 45 feet in length, 15 to 20 feet in diameter and the whirling ring 30-35 feet in diameter. Taylor called Oakland Center again, briefly describing what he had experienced. The Center mentioned that they had been getting reports for the past few nights from the San Jose area, south of his location. The con- trollers were curious about the sighting.  . Five minutes later, now over the southern end of Lake Berryessa, Taylor saw the UFO again. This time it was at his 6:30 o'clock position. He wanted to make sure he was not see- ing some kind of reflection, so he turned off the. inside and outside lights. With the lights off the pilot could still see the UFO. He then banked the plane to the left and was able to see the reflection of the glow- ing object on top of the left wing. He told Oakland Center the object was near him again, and they told him they would try to vector other air- craft to his position for a confirming look at his unusual aerial companion. Taylor's aircraft and the UFO were still in a clear sky area with a 12,000 foot overcast. The object again shot forward going though the same shape transformation, passed Taylor's plane and again made an instantaneous 90Â° vertical turn, then shot up through the overcast. An airliner at 22,000 feet saw it come up through the over- past. Oakland.-Center asked if the pilots of the aircraft wanted to make a report on the object, both declined to do so. Sighting No. 2 On August 8, 1981 at 2:30 a.m. P.D.T. near San Luis reservoir, some 45 miles airline southeast of San Jose, John Taylor saw the same or*a similar \"ringed\" UFO for a second time. Taylor again was flying a low-wing Piper aircraft on a .V-107 air. map heading toward the northwest. He â¢ was returning to the Novato aVea north'of San Francisco from a charter Piper Archer II model that experienced E-M effects flight to Palm Springs, Calif. Again he was flying IFR, mainly for practice, which he often does on his night flights. The sky was perfectly clear, the first quarter moon had already set beyond the horizon. The strange \"ringed\" teardrop UFO showed up this time at his 10:30 o'clock position as he flew along at an altitude of ap- proximately 7,500 feet. He tried to call Oakland Center to report the presence of the UFO but discovered that both communications radios were not functioning. A quick check showed that both navigation receiv- ers were also not working. The digital read-out on the DME (Distance Measuring Equipment) started changing numbers, then went blank. Becoming alarmed about all this sudden equipment failure Taylor then turned a radio switch to \"test\" and turned up the volume in an at- tempt to at least hear static noise level. There was none on either head- phones or speaker. All this time the UFO held 'its 10:30 position ahead and off his left wing, estimated from one-half to one mile distance. .Con- cerned about all the apparent E-M ef- fects on the electrical instrumenta- tion, it was gratifying to know that the engine continued to function perfectly, without missing a beat. At the time, Oakland Center radar had the Piper aircraft on their screens, before and after the sighting, which lasted approximately 5 minutes. Dur- ing this time the object would move across his path, shoot up, cross over his path and down. It would cross his path again and repeat the maneuver. It was as if the ringed UFO was mak- ing a box in front of him and around his path. It would also drift back, then shoot forward. Taylor maneuvered his plane a number of times when the opportun- ity came, to get a better and closer look at the craft. On one occasion he was able to move to within 500 feet. This closest approach was made from behind and below. He could see the spinning ring very clearly at this posi- tion, along with 'its red, blue and white colors. The coloring looked like a rainbpw effect. When he came to within 500 feet, the object would pull away from him, seemingly sensing his approach.    â¢ Just before the object accelerated, the ring would spin faster and almost vanish. The orange color of the craft would intensify also, especially at the nose.

At a Board meeting in January 1982, the Board of Directors of the national investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena (NICAP) resigned and a new Board was elected. Sher- man Larsen, former president of NICAP's Chicago Affiliate, was elected president; Fred Merritt vice- president; and John Timmerman secretary-treasurer. The move was the culmination of a friendly acquisi- tion of NICAP, and the new Board members all are officers of CUFOS as well. In effect, CUFOS has acquired all the assets of NICAP, particularly the extensive UFO sighting files which will be archived by Mr. Larsen and ultimately made available to research- ers. The new Board has assumed cer- tain obligations, including the respon- sibility to provide a newsletter or publication to the remaining NICAP members. NICAP will remain a separate corporation at least until debts are retired and other financial matters are settled, and then its future will be decided. It could become a subsidiary of CUFOS, or be absorbed totally, if not maintained as a separate entity. NICAP has a long and colorful history. At its peak in the 1960's it had approximately 14,000 members and was receiving, and investigating, more UFO reports each year than the Air Force which had official respon- sibility for UFO investigation. Formed in 1956, a period in which UFOs were all but a \"dead\" issue, NICAP achieved national prom- inence in 1957 when the Director, Maj. Donald E. Keyhoe, USMC (Ret.), acquired the services on its Board of such nationally known figures as Rear Admiral Delmer S. Fahrney, USN (Ret.), former chief of Navy guided missiles, and Vice Adm. R.H. Hillenkoetter, USN (Ret.), former Director of the Central In- telligence Agency. Because of its Washington location, NICAP had access to the national news media and cultivated many con- tacts in Government agencies and in Congress. As its reputation grew, highly qualified witnesses including airline pilots, scientists, and engineers began reporting their sightings to NICAP and these were used as leverage to prove the seriousness of the UFO problem to Government of- ficials. By the 1960's, contacts in the Air Force, State Department, and . (continued on next page) Ringed UFO, Continued and the object got brighter with each pulse. The shape of the UFO would gradually be absorbed into what ap- peared to be a big ball of fire, all within a few seconds. It passed through this sequence of changes dur- ing the acceleration as it shot forward, then again made a vertical 90 degree turn straight up and disappeared from sight. Taylor now noticed that all his radio equipment was again function- ing normally. Contact was then made with Oakland Center and he learned they had been concerned because his plane had gone off the radar screens during the maneuvering of the UFO in front of him. The object itself never showed up on the Oakland radar scopes, but somehow did block his aircraft out at the time. Oakland Center was informed about the in- truder, but these controllers showed no interest, or perhaps no belief in what this pilot related to them. The radio and navigation equip- ment of the aircraft were later checked over and found to be in perfect working order. No E-M varia- tion on the equipment was noticed during the sighting regardless of various aircraft and UFO positions relative to each other. Strangely enough, these two sight- ings occurred before and after the February 1981 rash of sightings of glowing red aerial objects seen for about a week in the vicinity of the San Jose, Calif., airport. This included aircraft pacings, one right in the traffic pattern. The airplanes and equipment in- volved in the two sightings were as follows: .November 5, 1980 â The airplane involved was a 1980 Piper Turbo Saratoga SP. 1st nav radio was a King RNAV KNS80. 1st com radio was a King KY196/197 and the 2nd Nav/- Com was a King KX 175B. The flight control panel was a KC 200 system. No problems were encountered with any equipment on the plane during this sighting. August 8, 1981 â The airplane was a 1980 Piper Archer II. The equipment was 1st Comm/King Kyl96/197; 1st Nav, King KN 53 Loge Indicator 1000; 2nd Comm/Nav KX 175B Indicator KI 205 (King). Problems occurred with most of this equipment during the second sighting. Dr. J. Allen Hynek, (Center for UFO Studies, Director) visiting the San Francisco area November 19, 1981 for a television appearance, also interrogated the witness and taped the interview. Even though this witness was the only observer aside from the two airline pilots in the one encounter who refused to identify themselves, his sincerity, honesty, and credibility seem unquestionable. The unknown object involved was described in such detail that it seems to exclude any known natural phe- nomenon. We believe this witness to be truthful in describing the incidents as he has. Since he does not wish his name used publicly, he is not seeking notoriety in any way but felt he should report the strange object and its unusual behavior to science in- vestigators. D"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"NICAP, Continued even some intelligence agencies often referred UFO cases to NICAP. The high caliber information and NICAP's reputation for conservatism and discretion, in turn, impressed many newsmen who increasingly used NICAP as a primary news source on UFOs. During sighting waves, the NICAP office typically was beseiged by newsmen. After Congressional hearings in 1966, a long-time NICAP goal, a review of the Air Force UFO pro- gram was ordered and this ultimately took the form of the University of Colorado UFO Project headed by Dr. Edward U. Condon. Initially, NICAP cooperated fully with the Project, providing thousands of substantial case reports and other information. As it gradually became clear that the Project leaders only wanted to be able to say that they had NICAP's cases, and that they had no intention of studying them objectively, NICAP withdrew its support and began an all- out effort to combat the apparent whitewash. In doing so, it nearly bankrupted itself and began a slow decline. Under Major Keyhoe's leadership, NICAP was essentially an action organization â not a business â and it got definite results. It had formed a highly effective national and interna- tional investigation and information network rivalling that of Air Force in- telligence. Administrative documents in the Project Blue Book files now held in the National Archives include plaintive comments about what a thorn in the side NICAP was to the Air Force, constantly beating Air Force investigators to the scene of important sightings, conducting thor- ough investigations, and publicizing the results. This often embarrassed the Air Force, as did NICAP's na- tional publicity disputing Air Force findings and negative statements about UFOs. The negative conclusions of the Condon Report, however, dulled public interest and NICAP found itself fighting an uphill battle merely to survive. The board at this stage elected to seek a more business- oriented management and acquired the services of John L. Acuff, an en- trepreneur whose business includes managing several small associations. Initially not very well informed on UFOs, Acuff alienated the Affiliate and Subcommittee leaders who con- stituted the backbone of the organiza- tion, and one-by-one they resigned and joined APRO, MUFON, or (later) CUFOS. He made a conscientious ef- fort to reorganize NICAP on a self- sustaining basis, but the severe talent drain and the general decline in public support, as well as the assertion of leadership by the other groups, con- tributed to the decline. During the early 1970's NICAP continued to function and to publish worthwhile information. Its reputa- tion was such that a Pentagon \"Deep Throat\" leaked the now-famous 1976 Iranian jet-chase case to NICAP, and when the New Zealand movie film was taken in 1978, it was NICAP that New Zealand and Australian in- vestigators and newsmen turned to for analysis. But these were excep- tions, and the other groups now dominated both in information- gathering and in investigative and research talent. By about 1976 rumors were afloat that NICAP had put out feelers about merging with one or more other UFO groups, and its declining resources were a matter of public record. In 1972, for example, it sustained a net operating loss of $9,928.91 and its 1973 budget for \"general research\" was $00.00. In 1978 the author par- ticipated in extensive discussions and negotiations with the NICAP Board and was being considered for the post of President under a new coalition ar- rangement involving CUFOS and MUFON. But the negotiations fell through and NICAP continued on as basically a paper organization for three more years. The acquisition by CUFOS now assures that the valuable NICAP sighting files (an estimated 10,000-15,000 first-hand, investigated reports and a large quantity of other important information) will be preserved for posterity and the data will be available to UFO researchers at some point. Those of us who Maj. Donald E. Keyhoe, USMC (Ret.) 1978 photograph. worked so hard to compile that UFO data base can take pride in the ac- complishment, and know that it will continue to be a valuable resource. NICAP played an important role in UFO history; but people made NICAP. The remaining viable UFO groups provide the current leader- ship, and the survival of NICAP as an organization is no longer important. At one time NICAP was the thin red line battling for public awareness against total obfuscation of the sub- ject. That situation no longer exists. CUFOS is to be applauded for its ini- tiative and the important action it has taken. The new address is: NICAP, P.O. Box 607, Lima, OH 45802.

Since 1972 W.J. (Bill) Vogel, an associate with the Center for UFO Studies, has documented numerous cases of noc- turnal lights and close encounters. 1 ' 2 Fire lookouts, whose jobs require meticulous and cautious observation of the 3,500 square miles of Indian lands, have had many of these UFO sightings. Two of these lookouts have 29 years of seasonal fire-watch ex- perience between them. Dorothea Sturm, a lookout at Sopelia Tower from 1962 to 1965, has served at Satus Peak Lookout since 1966. Louise Kutz has been relief lookout at both stations (except for one year) since 1972. Gladys McDaniel, retired for many years, served 14 years at Signal Peak Lookout and four at Sopelia. All three lookouts have Yakima Indian lineage. The responsibility of fire lookouts demands near-constant vigilance. \"You're always watching,\" Sturm told me. \"When you go off duty, you watch. When you go to bed at night, you wake up four or five times dur- ing the night and look around.\" Trained and experienced in the use of maps, firefinders and knowledge- able of landmarks and the telltale signs of fires, the lookouts can direct firefighters and equipment, including helicopters, to fires in the quarter- quarter section of a square-mile region of land. When a fire is visible to more than one station, the lookouts \"cross-shoot\" (triangulate) the source, assuring precise location of the fire. In addition to observing, the lookouts file weather reports twice a day and a third report on the wind in early evening during the summer months. July and August are the months of highest fire potential, and Sturm and Yakima Indian Reservation. Locations of lookout stations and UFO sightings are indicated, along with major landmarks and population centers. Kutz sometimes have \"feelings\" of im- pending fires. \"You don't mess around when you get those feelings,\" Sturm said. \"You just look with the binoculars until the tears almost run out of your eyes.\" Above all, look- outs on the Reservation scrutinize very carefully any smoke they sight before acting. \"A lookout always has the horror of calling in a fire when it's not a fire,\" Sturm said. Not surprisingly, then, when Sturm and Kutz sight odd reddish-orange or yellowish-orange balls at night float- ing in the air at various locations over the Reservation, they are puzzled, especially since these objects are in rugged, unpopulated wilderness ter- ritory. Two locations that are \"favorites\" of these balls are in higher elevations â the Goat Rocks just out- side the northwest corner of the In- dian lands; and the buttes and valleys west of the timberline that divides the Reservation approximately in half and north of the Simcoe Mountains that form a natural boundary along the southern edge of the Reservation (see Figure l). Sturm and Kutz usually observe these objects between 10 and 20 seconds. Generally, the lookouts spot the balls accidentally while turning their heads during watch. Rarely do the balls afford long, studied observa- tions. Teasingly, the balls go out as if a light were switched off before the lookouts can use their binoculars. \"I'm convinced those things know when you're talking about them,\" Sturm said, recalling that several times when she and Kutz alerted each other by radio of the presence of the objects near the goat Rocks, the balls \"went out.\" In the summer of 1979, Sturm and a visitor observed a ball the color of a harvest moon hanging stationary on the horizon. The object went out in less than half a minute. \"I don't know why but I said, 'Come back, come back.' There it was again!\" The (continued on next page) 8"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"Yakima, Continued witness watched the object another 15 seconds before it vanished perma- nently. The balls also seemed to be aware of the approach of an outside observer during the heavy UFO ac- tivity period of 1972 to 1974.' The balls are usually seen in August, September, and October. Two balls at most are sighted together at one time. The circles drawn in Figure 2 are lookouts' estimated sizes of the balls when observed from distances be- tween 10 and 30 miles. When closer, t such as amid the buttes north of the Simcoes, some balls seem quite large. The balls are most often observed hovering above the buttes and the horizon. Recently the balls made a curious appearance. At Sopelia Tower on July 4, 1981 at 10:10 p.m., Kutz was observing a lightning storm south of the Reservation over the Columbia River. She saw a bright, orange light hovering above a ridge along the river. After 15 seconds, the light went out. Soon another light appeared slightly west of the first light's posi- tion. This too went out. At 10:30 p.m. Sturm believed she saw a bright orange light southwest of her vantage point of Satus Peak and north of the Simcoes. Could this be the \"State\" (non-Reservation) fire that a third lookout at Signal Peak Look- out had reported moments before? Looking through binoculars showed otherwise. She took an azimuth shot before the \"fire\" went out. Soon a sec- ond light appeared, traveling south- east to northwest near McKay's Butte. It too vanished. The next morning Sturm sighted her line of shot and discovered that the \"fire\" had been on Mount Hood, 70 air miles southwest in northern Oregon. But the mountain was snow- covered, and snow doesn't burn. An ambiguous but tempting rela- tionship seems to exist between these balls and what seem to the eye to be counterfeit \"fires.\" One dark night Gladys McDaniel noticed from Signal Peak Lookout a \"big blaze\" south of Mount Rainier near Packwood \"strung out\" along the side of a mountain. The fire had the color of flames but didn't behave like a fire. Suddenly the fire \"rolled itself up into a ball\" and rose up into the air 'where it hung sta- tionary, changing colors from orange to yellow, until it \"went out like an electric light.\" Fires have definite motion â they flicker, growing bigger and dying out as combustible material is provided and consumed. One is prompted to theorize that these balls pose as \"fires\" to taunt their observers. Sturm has awakened in the middle of the night to red \"glows\" coming from behind buttes, to an apparent fire on the south slope of Toppenish Mountain 4 air miles east of her lookout which mysteriously disappeared after 5 minutes -of viewing. McDaniel testi- fied to seeing a \"burning building\" that fell apart in flames. Yet when a helicopter arrived, the fire was gone, leaving no evidence of scorching. On the night of July 20, 1974, Sturm puzzled over a red glow on the bottom slopes of Mount Adams far to the west. She watched the glow a long time until it went out. Later that night a forester called on the radio from the valley and said that he had seen what looked, like a fire near Mount Adams but that it was gone when he arrived home. Just before 9:00 a.m. weather check the next day, Sturm was looking west in the direction of Mount Adams, wondering what she had seen the night before, when suddenly a long, light-silver or gray cigar-shaped object appeared in flight just west of Mill Creek Guard Station, travelling from south to north. She grabbed her bin- oculars and watched the object dis- appear behind Deer Butte 12 miles away. The object never appeared on the other side. Other Oddities In addition to hovering orange balls and fire-like glows on the ground, the Reservation seems to have a unique class of phenomena related more to light and cloud effects than to objects in the \"standard\" UFO sense. For ex- ample, the guard at Mill Creek Guard Station saw a \"glow\" travel overhead at night. At another time, Sturm was Estimated sizes of UFO \"fireballs\" awakened at Satus Peak Lookout one night by a white \"glow\" so bright that the interior of her cabin lit up. A roundish cloud, about 12 miles east of the station and at 40 degrees eleva- tion, was alternately dimming and brightening. An indistinct object seemed to be behind the cloud. At times the cloud intensified more brightly than at others. Sturm watched the cloud for 30 minutes un- til it finally dimmed out into nothing. There was no moon that night. Lookouts and others on the Reser- vation have also observed another od- dity. Several times Sturm has seen what she can only describe as very bright \"flashes\" or \"beams\" of light come out of or go into canyons or groups of trees at night. Once she observed from Satus Lookout a \"white light like a real, real bright beam\" flash down from the sky at an angle and enter Wilson Charley Can- yon northwest of Sopelia Lookout. The lookout at Sopelia witnessed the same phenomenon. At other times, Sturm has seen a similar bright flash, like the effect of a \"transformer blow- ing\" (but not as brilliant), come out of certain canyons. These sightings lasted a split second. McDaniel also saw-\"blue flashes\" in the sky during her years as a lookout. Before the flashes started, the sky took on a strange pale-green, misty cast and seemed to form a \"big cur- tain.\" Then the flashes began at various places on the \"curtain,\" going on and off as if practicing or signaling to one another. McDaniel recalled observing from Sopelia Tower these sky and flash effects occurring east of Goldendale (a town 20 miles south of the Reservation) and west of the Han- ford Project from her vantage point. The effects lasted up to 30 minutes, and eventually the sky returned to normal and the flashes ceased. McDaniel has seen lightning of various colors, and believes that what (continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"Yakima, Continued she saw was not lightning, strobe lights, or the Northern Lights. A little after midnight one summer, McDaniel thought that lightning had awakened her, for something was making colorful effects in the sky. Stepping just beyond the door of Sopelia Tower, she saw a \"rocket\" hanging motionless east of her in a clear sky marked by a few small clouds. The altitude of the object was approximately 1,800 feet. She sur- mised later that the object, because of its position, could have come out of Shenando Canyon. The bottom of the rocket was like dull, dark metal and was tipped a little, showing a dark underside punctured with little holes. From these holes a fanlike spray of \"steam\" or \"exhaust\" poured out in red, white, green, and blue colors. But something was strange about the ex- haust â it sprayed out in separate \"dashes\" or \"broken lines.\" McDaniel stood amazed for several minutes, thinking how beautiful the colors were. Then suddenly, like a \"cat awakening,\" the colorful fan extend- ed downward and lengthened, a \"stretching effect\" that lasted a sec- ond, and then the rocket and the ex- haust went out. Sturm watched a reddish glow behind Simon's Butte one evening through the firefinder. \"I always rest my elbows on the firefinder, which is in the center of the lookout to steady the binoculars as I look through them, and look. Then this rocket-thing shot up in the air from behind the butte, and that was all.\" Twice during the summer of 1981, Sturm saw \"blue-green\" objects like meteors traveling at low elevation about 10 to 15 degrees above the horizon. She insisted they weren't meteors because of their excessively slow speed. Sturm saw orange balls â much smaller than those spotted elsewhere on the Reservation â bounding along a ridge north of Fort Simcoe. McDaniel witnessed from Signal Peak Lookout similar balls about the size of ping-pong balls bounding along the ground on Satus Peak and along Top- penish Ridge. Sky conditions were clear. \"Not Just a Light\" â¢ Sturm's cigar-shaped object and McDaniel's \"rocket\" suggest \"craft\" of some kind. On September 29, 1978, Louise Kutz witnessed an event that in her mind was clearly distinct from the generally short-lived nocturnal light phenomena that she is so familiar with. In her words, taped on October 3, 1978: \"I have really and truly for the first time seen something other than these fast-traveling white lights, I mean something I really saw and know was there, I mean some- thing apart from just a light.\" At 11:00 p.m. Kutz turned the television off at Satus Peak Lookout, prepared for bed, and while stepping to the fridge for a glass of water, glanced through the west windows and noticed a bright, orangeish light similar to a car's distant headlight, but twinkling, in the direction of Goat Rocks. The object was much bigger and brighter than a star. She sat down on a bench in front of the heater, and bracing her arms, looked at the object through 7 x 50 binoculars. Without them, she held up her finger and sighted along it to see if the object was moving. Satisfied it wasn't, Kutz closely studied the object which was an oblong-shaped solid light. She noticed, however, that in the middle of the light various multi- colored lights having all the hues of the rainbow swelled and surged. These lights were extremely beautiful and Kutz exclaimed out loud in awe. Later she would compare the lights to a \"fountain spilling out.\" She watched the pulsating lights for about 45 seconds; then everything faded away. Wondering if. she would see any- thing else, she kept looking at the same spot through the binoculars. The night was starlit although not bright â the moon was not out. For the first time, she noticed a few long, flat, thin clouds above the horizon of the Goat Rocks. Haze prevalent in the west earlier in the day had moved north and east of Satus Peak, leaving the west clear except for these clouds. Two or three seconds passed, and a glow lit the underside of the clouds, and Kutz's eyes were drawn almost simultaneously to a black space some distance beneath the clouds where she saw \"an illuminated row of square windows.\" The windows, three to five in number, were not lit them- selves; rather, illumination seemed to be falling on the \"casings,\" outlining the shapes of the windows and com- ing from solid light that appeared to be on the opposite ends of each win- dow. The windows at the far ends of the row seemed \"fuzzed out.\" Kutz later compared the brightness of the windows to that of an illuminated clock at night. In a few seconds, the windows faded out, and the original oblong light reappeared with its surging lights. Kutz wanted to radio someone but thought that if she did the light would go out. After about 5 minutes, the lights dimmed out, and a line of individual red lights \"flipped on\" from right to left. After about 4 seconds, everything went totally dark, and a single green and red light started toward her from where the UFO had been. Through binoculars Kutz observed no object attached to the lights, and she went outside on the catwalk and watched the lights pass north of her. One or two white lights appeared at the \"back\" of the object. None of the lights blinked. The object moved at \"a pretty good clip,\" and she could hear a faint motor. She watched the lights pass over Highway 97, and went inside the lookout cabin without watching them further. \"I came in, and I couldn't go to sleep,\" she testified. \"I went over it step by step in my mind, and since then I've sat there and said, 'Louise, you didn't see what you saw. You just think you saw what you saw.' \" Total sighting time â about 15 minutes. During this time, the UFO never moved. What was the object that passed north of her? The UFO itself? An ob- ject from the UFO? A plane from the vicinity of the UFO? Whatever the object was near the Goat Rocks, it was big, Kutz estimated, given her distance from the object, the size of the oblong light and the windows, and the distance between the win- (conlinued on next page) 10"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"Yakima, Continued dows and the illuminated clouds far above it. Bill Vogel determined that no Air Force refueling planes, often UFO im- posters, were present in the vicinity. A few nights t later, Sturm witnessed through binoculars from Satus Peak Lookout a row of square lights, like \"train windows,\" float by between two buttes. Illuminated from the in- side; the lights went behind a butte and never came out. Other Strange Things Dorothea Sturm's first UFO sighting occurred between 1962 and 1965. While at Sopelia Tower, Sturm brought along her younger daughter who slept on a cot' near a window. One night her daughter insisted again and again that she \"Look at the thing up in the sky!\" Losing her patience, Sturm finally stepped to the south window and observed a \"light- colored light\" like a star traveling back and forth from west to east and east to west high above the Columbia River/ stopping each time before resuming its flight, until after 2 or 3 minutes, the object vanished \"like turning out a light.\" On June 22, 1981, about 9:35 p.m., Sturm was sitting at the table at Satus Peak Lookout and looking north. She suddenly saw a large, bright white light float down from the southeast and enter a small, thin, dark cloud that was hanging over Ahtanum Ridge or Yakima. The light never came out. It should have, Sturm at- tested, since the cloud wasn't very big. The object wasn't traveling as fast as a meteor. 3 While at Signal Peak Lookout one night, McDaniel noticed a light, like a \"street light,\" sparkling through the leaves of a tree and positioned over Cedar Valley to the south. She decid- ed to signal the unusual light with her flashlight. When she did, a red-orange ball the size of a basketball came from the direction of Cedar Valley, circled the cabin once, and connected with or entered the - light, whereupon both vanished. In October 1979 late on a dark evening, a \"high-pitched whine\" or a \"shrill\" sound passed over the top of Satus Peak Lookout, its duration that of a car passing a house out on the highway. Both Strum and Kutz heard the sound; it was definitely not the wind or an aircraft. Kutz has heard a sound several times that she can only describe as \"happy little voices sing- ing\" in the distance near Satus Peak Lookout. She reasons that the sound could be the result of atmospheric conditions. Years ago, three other lookouts, including Larry George, 4 heard a \"woman screaming\" near the station. One lookout walked down the road and called; no one respond- ed. Sturm, Kutz, and other lookouts have heard \"underground sounds\" or \"rumblings\" like the sound of an old logging truck pulling up a hill and never getting to the top. The sounds seem to come from deep within the ground. Two Washington State geol- ogists who visited Sturm on Satus Peak testified to hearing similar sounds in the mountains of Montana. They offered no explanation. Two times at Satus, Sturm smelled an \"awful odor\" like a \"stinky hogpen\" pervading the air. One morning she heard a noise like a \"scream\" or \"holler\" down in the can- yon. Kutz has detected a sickening, awful, pungent odor (not that of a dead animal) at the same station. \"I can't say I do or don't believe in Bigfoot,\" Sturm cautioned. \"I just don't know.\" A part poodle and terrier dog that often stays with the lookouts at Satus Peak has inexplicably whined appre- hensively while sleeping at the top of the stairs. The dog is normally placid. A visitor's pet chihuahua went around a corner of the Satus Peak road one day and mysteriously vanished in broad daylight without a sound or trace of struggle. Afterthoughts Sturm and Kutz laughed at the memory of some embarrassing mis- identified fires and UFOs. Kutz once interpreted the effect of distant water sprinklers spraying water as smoke. The sun and moon shining through clouds have given the appearance of UFOs. Another time, Sturm and Kutz were sure that a UFO had landed when they saw a beam of light shin- ing up over the edge of Satus Peak. They : ventured a look and discovered an electrical repair truck with its spotlight on; its occupant had come to work on the microwave station. One evening Kutz had an overpowering conviction that UFOs would make an appearance. They did â as the Northern Lights. Such reactions are normal in a set- ting where even seasoned observers can often be fooled by the vagaries of nature, and where UFOs have made so many appearance's that a general (and understandable) anticipation of their \"arrival\" becomes second nature' to the observers as each year they eagerly begin a new fire-watch season. Yet Sturm and Kutz know full well the tricks of atmospheric distortion, the characteristics of astronomical bodies, and the familiar configura- tions of aircraft lights and the behavior of manmade craft. Interac- tions of sunlight with smoke or haze can lend a reddish or orangeish cast to planets or stars, which requires a sec- ond look to distinguish these from the orange-red balls over the Reservation. Extra-bright planets call for careful discrimination, and Sturm and Kutz separate the green and red lights, strobe lights, blinking lights, and the flight patterns of aircraft from noctur- nal lights. Neither lookout has any idea what the objects on the Reserva- tion are. They simply want to know. Lousie Kutz said: \"I want to get to the answer. You know, fear of the unknown is worse than fear of the known.\" All three lookouts have observed ball lightning on the Reservation, the most likely candidate, if any, for the mysterious reddish-orange balls. But the ball lightning they have seen has always been associated with lightning storms, unlike the fleeting UFO balls they have witnessed.

The study is being con- ducted by Ted Bloecher, Budd Hopkins, and Dr. Aphrodite Clamar. In addition, $200 was awarded to Stanton T.

Unfor- tunately, if all three projects were funded in full, it would seriously deplete the Fund's resources. There- fore, the Executive Committee is negotiating with the grantees to make phased payments that would allow them to get the projects underway.

When a visitor, then, to Yakima In- dian Reservation eliminates usual identified flying objects (IFOs) from consideration as UFO imposters, what is he to make of this rich UFO \"menagerie\"? Perhaps a game is being played, and a \"message\" being \"sent.\" Harley Rutledge, Chairman of the Physics Department at Southeast Missouri State University, gradually lost his skepticism about UFO existence dur- ing several years of field observation of the phenomenon. He concluded that more was involved during his (and fellow colleagues') active research than \"measurement of physical properties of UFOs by dispassionate observers. A relation- ship, a cognizance, between us and the UFO intelligence evolved. In my opinion, this additional consideration is more important than-the measure- ments or establishing that the phe- nomenon exists.\" 5 Do the reddish-orange balls pur- posely vanish before binoculars are brought to bear on them, and at the instant lookouts alert each other of their presence over the radio? Was it coincidence that the ball reappeared when Sturm pleaded for it to 'Come back'? What were the chances that Sturm would see the cigar-shaped object she did the day after she had observed a red glow on Mount Adams â and while at the same time wondering what she had seen the preceding night? Sturm told me that on the evening she saw apparent \"train windows\" (and only a few days after Kutz's similar observation), she (Sturm) had been watching through binoculars all day. \"I don't know why, but some days you spend all day with the binoculars looking around,\" she said. Did the \"train windows\" take \"advan- tage\" of Sturm's behavior and inten- tionally appear in her field of view, thus making sure she got a \"good look\"? Are the UFOs having \"fun\" at the lookouts' expense by posing as \"fires\"? How long would the starlike object over the Columbia River have con- tinued to make its methodical hor- izontal passage if Sturm had not gone to the window? How long would it have \"performed\" for her daughter? Was the UFO \"performing\" for other witnesses? And finally, if in some cases a \"cognizance\" occurs between a UFO and the percipient, what is being \"known\" â by either party? NOTES AND REFERENCES 1.

One night Bill Vogel observed from the out- skirts of White Swan a moving, bright orange light that split into two lights which subse- quently went out. Shortly afterwards, a fast- moving pinpoint of white light suddenly descended from the sky and approached a trailer park situated between himself and Satus Peak. Vogel momentarily took his eyes off the light. When he looked again, the white light was gone. In its place was a white, phosphores- cent glowing cloud. The cloud began moving. As it did, it began dissipating, leaving phosphorescence behind, which eventually disappeared. (Personal conversation, August 1981).  * 4.

If we are to judge by thousands of close encounter reports made by reliable and reasonable human witnesses all over the world, we could assume that UFO in- telligences (whoever or whatever they may be) accomplish their con- tacts with perfect planning, unswerv- ing purpose, and unmatchable skill. In other words, \"they\" know what they are doing and do it flawlessly. Once in a while, however, a witness is convinced that the close ap- proach by a UFO is a \"mistake\" by its occupants. Two of these alleged \"mistakes\" have come to my attention during the past 7 years. The first, sur- facing in 1976, was a curiosity to me. I had never heard of \"mistakes\" made by UFO beings, but since the reported, case came from an extreme- ly perceptive witness, I published it in the literature. 1 Now, as of this date of writing (Dec. 20, 1981) another al- leged \"mistake\" has been reported by what seems to be a reliable and equal- ly intelligent witness. It would be interesting to see if these two cases have any aspects in common. // mistakes are being made by some UFO beings during interac- tion with the human race, these mistakes can provide clues about motive and purpose of UFOs, equally as much as \"perfect\" contacts can. The first mistake referred to above was published in The Tujunga Canyon Contacts. For the purposes of at- tempted correlation and also for the benefit of those readers who may not yet have seen this book, 2 I will reiterate the essential facts of this unusual case. According to the two women per- cipients, Emily Cronin and Jan Whitley, 3 who were at the time of the sighting residing in the Tujunga Can- \"Mistakes\" in UFO Contacts yons area of California, they were returning late at night in the spring of 1956 from a vacation trip at Lake Isabella, Calif. They were driving along the Ridge Route (Highway 99), which is a winding highway through the mountains from Bakersfield. This ' route is much traveled even at night by trucks transporting goods between the widespread cities of California and neighboring states. The head- lights of the numerous trucks began , to hurt Jan's eyes as she drove. Seeing a wide rest stop, they pulled off the highway and went to sleep in their car, intending to continue their journey home when the traffic thinned out. Some time later, Emily was abrupt- ly awakened from sleep by a bright yellow-white light shining in the left rear window of the car. She assumed it was a trucker pulling off the highway, but to her surprise she found herself unable to move. She'd gone to sleep lying on the passenger side of the front seat, while Jan was sleeping sitting behind the steering wheel, her head resting on the win- dow beside her. Emily heard a loud, whirring sound somewhat like an electric generator. Its.piercing tone seemed somehow related to her inex- plicable paralysis. Then she felt the car being shaken from side to side and received an impression that a large, dark humanoid shape was on the left rear of the car looking in at her 5-year-old son who lay sleeping on the back seat. Jan also saw the bright light and was aware of total paralysis presumably produced by a high pierc- ing noise. She also felt the car shake. This state of affairs continued for some minutes; then suddenly the noise and bright light vanished and the shaking stopped. The two wit- nesses were then able to move. Without a word, Jan roared the car in- to life and sped down the mountain. Neither she nor Emily spoke until they had negotiated the winding road and were near a familiar restaurant at the base of the mountain. Then they began to talk excitedly, exchanging information about what they had seen and felt. They concluded that they had both experienced the same things, but the episode remained totally inexplicable for many years. Hypnotic regression was per- formed on both witnesses in 1976 when the case came to researchers' at- tention many years later. Jan was unable to achieve a sufficiently deep hypnotic state to recall any clear pic- ture of what might- have happened. Emily, however, proved to be an ex- cellent subject and during a session on March 24, 1976 with W. C. McCall, M.D., relived the experience in all its terror and mystery. During the recall of memories, she received a very strong impression that a \"mistake\" had been made and almost shouted this fact out to the investigators pres- ent. Later, in debriefing, Emily clarified this unusual statement. She felt con- vinced that three humanoids, tall and black-garbed, had parked a large, lighted craft farther back in the rest stop and one of them had approached the car. He looked in the rear left win- dow of the automobile, and had shaken the car from side to side, for what reason Emily could not discern. She did find herself somehow \"tapped\" into their telepathic com- munication and discerned that the humanoid's two companions stood some distance from the car, calling (mentally?) to their companion and urging him to leave because a \"mistake\" had been made.. They (continued on next page) 13"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"California Report, Continued repeatedly told the inquisitive one that they must continue on to their proper destination. Eventually the curious humanoid left the car and re- joined his fellows. These were the essential factors on a \"mistaken\" contact with in- telligences from an unknown source. The case remained, to my know- ledge, the only \"mistake\" reported in UFO literature until Dec. 19, 1981, when Ms. C. W. 4 of Orange County, Calif., contacted me, asking for help with a difficult situation. According to Ms. W., her eyes had been rather severely injured during an encounter with a very bright \"shape\" which appeared in her bedroom in May 1981. She was awakened abruptly from a sound sleep and, for a fraction of a second, glimpsed a very bright orange glow- ing object standing across the room near her closet. The shape was not really solid, but more \"cloud-like\" in nature, but it was oval, about 7 feet tall and 3 feet wide. Ms. W. obtained these dimensions by comparing the object's -size to the nearby bedroom door. The cloud vanished almost instan- taneously after Ms. W. opened her eyes. She was surprised and intrigued, but felt no fear. She had trained herself in metaphysical techniques and instantly went into a meditative state, receiving the information that the appearance of the cloud-like ob- ject had been a \"mistake.\" Her meditation also yielded information that the cloud had intelligence of some sort in or about it, and she in- stinctively linked it to UFOs. Although she is not particularly knowledgeable about UFOs, she had viewed a documentary on the subject that same evening before retiring. She feels that the object was some sort of UFOlogical phenomenon but has no opinion as to whether it was an actual entity, a craft-like manifestation, or whatever. She deliberately continued medita- tion immediately after the incident, asking if she could be permitted con- tact with the intelligence, but re- ceived the answer that she was not \"developed\" enough to pursue the question further. She felt warned that she would be unable to determine or distinguish between \"good\" entities and \"evil\" entities involved in UFO activity. She was convinced, how- ever, the intelligence who had mis- takenly appeared in her room was essentially benevolent. Ms. W., upon arising, found her face severely reddened and her eyes bloodshot and painful, as if from a bad sunburn. The next day small blisters formed all over her face, but this cleared within a few days. She of- fers additional witnesses to confirm the damage to her face and eyes. Her eyes did not improve, however. She has gone to several doctors who con- firm conjuntivitis and tissue damage with various tentative diagnoses from allergies to infections. Her father, a chemical engineer, was of the opinion that she had somehow received radia- tion burns, but the doctors she con- sulted did not seem to understand or accept her statements regarding the apparent source of her problem. At the time she contacted me, her eyes seemed infected as though with a bacterial infection, which she sur- mises began because of the initial damage and sensitization of the eye tissues. I referred her to Richard M. Neal, Jr., M.D., a Los Angeles physi- cian who is conducting in-depth phys- iological/psychological research on alleged injuries stemming from close encounters, and she was also put in touch with other CE-III witnesses in this area who claim eye injury resulting from close UFO approaches. Since these are the only two cases in my extensive experience where mention of a \"mistake\" on the part of alleged UFO entities has surfaced, 1 was curious to see if any correlative factors were possible. The following aspects of each case seem similar: 1. In both cases the witnesses were women. 2. In both cases the witnesses were asleep just before contact, and abrupt- ly awakened. 3. Both cases involved bright light sources. 4. Both lights were inadequately perceived â the first because the witnesses, being paralyzed, were prevented from looking at the light directly, and the second because the light vanished after a fraction of a sec- ond's direct viewing. 5. In both cases, the witnesses were metaphysically inclined, regularly used meditative techniques, and re- ceived information about the nature of the occurrence during altered states of consciousness. 6. In both cases, the apparent in- telligences were benevolent or at least non-malevolent. What the above possible correla- tions mean I cannot conclude. What the nature of the \"mistakes\" were is equally tenuous. We have only the impressions of the witnesses to give us clues. In the first case, Emily Cronin felt that the humanoid had ac- quiesced to its companions' urging to stop exploring the car at the rest stop. Then, when the humanoid's investiga- tion continued overlong, the other two entities decided that they had made a \"mistake\" in agreeing to stop and at that point began to urge their colleague to come along. It was my own suggestion, however, that the entities might have stopped to check out Jan and Emily's car because Jan had been involved in another CE-III with another young woman, Sara Shaw, 4 in a Tujunga Canyon cabin in May 1953, scarcely 3 years before. Sara's hypnotic regression, in 1975, yielded the information that Sara (and also Jan?) had been \"marked\" by black-garbed aliens who examined the two witnesses aboard a Saturn- shaped UFO. This \"marking,\" accord- ing to Sara, was partially for the pur- pose of \"tracking,\" somewhat as animals are tracked by wildlife re- searchers. 5 Had the black-garbed aliens, in the spring of 1956, stopped to investigate Jan's car and found her companion to be not Sara, but Emily? Had they therefore determined that a \"mistake\" had been made and so went on their way? In searching for a logical reason why a \"mistake\" was made, a wide number of speculative answers could be surmised. The nature of the \"mistake\" involv- ing Ms. W. is likewise tenuous, but (continued on next page) 14"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"UFOs OR \"SOUL SHIPS?\" By Brent Raynes UFOlogy has become a rather selective and specialized interpretive process that seeks scientific ter- minology that provides a \"nuts and bolts\" definition and sanctioning.

The theory that an advanced extraterrestrial technology is visiting earth is, understandably enough, a very appealing intellectual exercise for modern, technological man. It is a perfect buffer against the despairs of uncertainty and ambiguity that modern man so despises and fears. The unknown, therefore, can be reconciled and accepted by man only once it has donned the suitable, condi- tioned appearances of something known and familiar. There was a time when science disregarded accounts of stones falling from out of the sky and labelled such stories as \"old wives' tales.\" Thomas Jefferson, back in 1801, reportedly declared that he would sooner believe that two Yankee professors had lied than to give any credence to such ac- counts. Galileo, unable to fit comets into his cosmology, outrageously sug- gested that the reports were at- tributable to reflections of hazes that rise up from the earth and into the sky \"higher than the moon.\" The first known military inquiry into UFOs goes back to Japan in 1235 A.D., when one General' Yoritsume and his men observed strange lights perform- ing various maneuvers in the sky. He promptly ordered an investigation and soon his experts had determined that the lights had only been stars swaying about in the sky from the force of the wind! Most reluctantly we sometimes come to terms with the truth only when it has become manifestly ob- vious and can no longer be disre- garded. Such is the case with modern astronomy and the accumulating evidence supporting what has become known as the expanding- universe or big-bang theory. Accord- ing to this concept, our galaxy, along with neighboring galaxies, resulted from a stupendous explosion of hydrogen gases perhaps some 20 billion years ago. \"1 would like to re- ject the big-bang theory, but I have to face the facts,\" an M.I.T. astronomer stated. Previous to the big-bang theory most astronomers seemed to prefer the steady-state theory, which gave our universe an eternal quality. No less than Albert Einstein was among those who resisted the evidence for the big-bang theory in emotional language. 1 hope I have made my point as to the fallibility of human reason molded by. existing cultural forces of whatever particular epoch he may be a part of. In this vein, I will now pro- ceed to explore an area of my own UFO-related studies that contradicts the notions held by hard-line \"nuts and bolts\" traditionalists in the UFO field, offering my brief digression in- to the subjective powers of human assumption as justification for my straying into an admitted realm of subjective, paranormal experience. \"What if they (the UFOnauts) know the secret of life and death?,\" ponders Mrs. Shirley Fickett of Ellsworth, Maine. \"Suppose there is an etheric plane that .we; go to after death, and the aliens know this plane well?\" For Mrs. Fickett such speculation is not idle whimsy. Back in 1969, she experienced a peculiar series of â¢ psychic situations. .It seemed as though some alien intelligence was \"training\" her in \"astral projection.\" During this time there were episodes in which it seemed that the spirit of her deceased father was trying to communicate with her. On one occa- sion as she was partially leaving her body, she saw an entity of very odd appearance in her bedroom. It stood roughly 4 feet high, she felt that it was male, and it had a coconut-shaped head with two slits for eyes and a tiny slit around where the nose would be, but there appeared to be no mouth. All of this high strangeness reached a climactic point on December 8, 1969, when Mrs. Fickett left her physical body and astrally, it seems, went to a house several blocks away (she was residing in Portland, Maine, (continued on nexl i'n$e) 15"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"\"Soul Ships?\" Continued at the time) where she saw a man, whom she realized was .the spirit of her father, embracing a young boy unfamiliar to her. Then her \"astral body\" was quickly transported back to her physical body, whereupon the \"astral\" of the boy appeared in her bedroom. \"I held my physical hand out in acceptance to receive him, or let him know I did,\" Mrs. Fickett states. \"He then vanished.\" It was not long afterwards that Mrs. Fickett feels she discovered who the boy was. In a casual conversation she had with a stranger, she learned that he believed that his son was ex- periencing psychic phenomena. As it turned out, this was the boy Mrs. Fickett had encountered astrally. Though she at first felt that the situa- tion was of a strictly religious context, the boy's description in November 1972 of a beam of light striking him and pinning him down in his bed drew her attention to the UFO aspect. During the experience, he claimed that there was a high frequency noise in the air and that the hands of his electric clock spun wildly around. Not long after Mrs. Fickett had documented this episode in her files she read the account of Uri Geller published in Psychic magazine, describ- ing how Geller had allegedly been struck by a beam originating from a UFO.shortly after his third birthday. Recognizing the similarities, Mrs. Fickett began considering the poten- tial implications of it all. The notion that mysterious aerial objects may be. connected with an afterlife is actually an ancient concept. So : called \"soul ships\" cruise the night skies, according to the old legends, picking up the souls of the recently departed. Today millions embrace as true the Biblical accounts of how Jesus Christ was bodily resurrected after death. The Bible describes how Christ was \"taken up\" and disappeared into a \"cloud,\" and relates how He will one day return \"in like manner\" from the sky (Acts 1:11). Modern man critically. views the situation from a psychological orien- tation. Back in 1959, the late Swiss psychiatrist, Dr. Carl G. Jung, wrote a scholarly book, Flying Saucers: A Modem Myth of Things Seen in the Skies. In it he soberly cautions his readers that despite the technological era in which we live UFO appearances may make people feel uneasy because the old notions that such things are portents of a \"great dying\" still have a foothold on us. In 1969, Merton Haskell of Paler- mo, Maine, described to me how as a young boy, back in the early 1930s, he and his parents, on about a dozen separate occasions and over about a 2-year period, observed mysterious pulsating balls of light, generally the size of a \"ten quart water pail.\" His \"mother, who has since passed away, verified the story for me as well. 'The last time anyone ever saw it was the night my grandfather died and it was sighted by my father on a stone wall, a line between our farm and the next,\" Haskell explained. \"This was the closest it ever got to our property. It was never seen by anyone after that.\" More recently, in 1978, S.W. Pierce, a respected businessman in Waynesboro, Tennessee, described for me how as a young man living in Lauderdale County, Alabama, he was walking alone one night along a rural country road when he saw a \"fiery red\" ball of light hovering a few feet above the roof of a house. \"It looked bigger than a regular basketball,\" he recalled. The next day he learned that a baby, suffering from some illness, had died in that very same house around the time he had observed the inexplicable apparition. For centuries there, have been stories about luminous apparitions associated with deaths. In recent years, a number of qualified medical researchers have investigated these accounts. In Life After Life, the author, Dr. Raymond A. Moody, Jr., M.D., explains that near-death percipients typically describe the appearance of a light. At first the light, which usually only the percipient perceives, is dim, but gradually it grows brighter until becoming brilliant. Usually it is a pure white light : and the percipient describes an but-of-body experience â¢ in 'which he is drawn towards the light, like a magnet, which turns 'out to be an entity â a mysterious \"being of light.\" Robert Anton Wilson describes in his book, Cosmic Trigger, The Final Secret of the Illuminati, how while receiving apparent telepathic communications from UFOnauts back in 1973-74, he also encountered these astral \"being of light\" appari- tions. He remarked how his entities compared to those perceived by near- death percipients. Are we splitting fine semantic hairs in our assignments of rigidly special- ized categories and definitions? Can we really comprehend the causes when we've not yet really correlated and compared all of the symptoms? On the night of January 6, 1976, three women from Liberty, Ken- tucky, shared in an extraordinary UFO experience. It was Mona Staf- ford's thirty-sixth birthday, and Louise Smith and Elaine Thomas ac- companied her to the Redwood restaurant in Lancaster, some 30 miles northeast, to celebrate the occasion. As they were returning, at about 11:30 p.m., along route 78, their car was paced by a huge domed, disc- shaped object. Smith, who was driv- ing, suddenly found that the car was out of her control, and with her foot removed from the gas pedal it was ac- celerating up to 85 miles per hour! Then the next conscious realization the women shared they were arriving in Hustonville, with no memory of having driven over an 8-mile stretch of road, and with approximately 80 minutes of time not accountable. Weeks later, under hypnosis, the women recalled how the car had been levitated by a brilliant blue beam into the UFO. Onboard the craft the women were then forced to submit to apparent physical examination and testing .. . some of which was ap- parently most unpleasant. On September 26, 1978, Elaine Thomas died of a heart attack. On Tuesday, October 23, 1979, while engaged in a long-distance telephone conversation''with Ohio UFOlogist Jerry Black, one'of the principal in- vestigators on this case, he explained to me'that hie had just been down to Kentucky, 3 days before our tele-' ' ' (continued on next page) 16."},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"\"Soul Ships?\" Continued phone conversation, doing more follow-up on the case. While there he had again spoken with Mona Stafford who told him that while Elaine had been in the hospital, suffering chest pains, that a nurse and a woman pa- tient had witnessed \"light beams shin- ing in the window\" and a single light \"bouncing off the walls and ceiling.\" Allegedly Elaine Thomas told the two women not to be frightened, that it was just the UFO entities, and a few hours later she passed away. \"They are from the planet Orion and are coming to take me away,\" a 12-year-old boy in New Jersey, dying of a brain tumor, reportedly declared when a mysterious light had mater- ialized above his bed. When in New Jersey, back in April 1977, I had the good fortune of meeting one of the witnesses to the strange light that ap- peared over the boy's bed on another occasion. The boy was having a con- vulsive seizure and my informant and another man looked after the boy as a nurse left the room to call a doctor. As they stood with concern by the boy's bedside a luminous bar of light appeared over the bed. \"It started as a minor light blue light, became brighter blue, and then turned white,\" he recalled. 'Throughout all of this time, even with the white light, it didn't show any brilliance on the wall. It then diminished in a blue and went out again, and by that time he had relaxed.\" The boy's father was celebrated UFO contactee Howard Menger. Essentially, much of the UFO message appears to be a symbolical one, with considerable emphasis focused on a death/rebirth theme. A Canadian newsletter devoted to al- leged telepathic communications re- ceived from UFOnauts, printed this message: \"There is no reason to go back, through the life-death cycle again if you but listen to your own salvation, to step into the light,, and blend evenly with this light.\" In Raymond E.

Zeller â¢ ' (MUFON Field Investigator) Government Camp., is located ap- proximately 50 miles southeast of Portland, Oregon, on Highway 26 at about 4,000 elevation on the south slope of Mt. Hood. About 2,000 feet higher up is Timberline Lodge, con- nected by a steep 6-mile stretch of- road, in a popular ski area. About 8:00 p.m. on Sept. 7, 1981, Bob Marshall of Government Camp stopped across from Chuck Coufal's service station after sighting an object moving from SW to NE toward Mt. Hood at about 1,000 feet altitude. He alerted people at the service station, and they attempted to watch it with binoculars. The UFO moved very slowly over the trees to a point near Timberline Lodge, then turned to the SE, now appearing football-shaped, and disappeared behind trees. Marshall called a friend, George Brady, at the Lodge and learned that he had been watching .three lights maneuver in the valley below when the call came. They had been per- forming extraordinary maneuvers. After hanging up, he went out on the entity encounter in 1967. Under hyp- nosis she described how she was â¢ushered into the presence of a huge bird, resembling an eagle, perhaps 15 feet tall, and how an intense fire reduced the big bird to a pile of ashes, then a large gray worm emerged from out of the ashes. In Fowler's research he discovered that Mrs. An- dreasson's vision had much in com- mon with the symbolic death and rebirth of the ancient Egyptian Phoenix. The Phoenix of legend was also reduced to ashes by fire and then emerged as a worm, from which a new Phoenix would grow: Whether literal or psychological, physical or visionary, the UFO ex- perience 'often produces psychic reac- tions similar to those of persons who have .experienced \"cosmic . con- sciousness.\" This complex aspect needs, to be carefully studied and should be of. tremendous interest and concern to social scientists. balcony and saw a disc-shaped object apparently within a mile and about 35-40 feet in diameter. It had a rotating red and yellow light on top. The lights in the valley below also were yellow and red, and moved slowly except for' sudden bursts of speed much faster than a helicopter as they, seemed to \"hug\" the terrain closely. At the service station below, Chuck .Coufal was very busy when Marshall crossed the road and pointed out the object, and he first thought it was a blimp. But then he realized it was something unfamiliar. Coufal, 31, had been in a demolition unit in the Army and claimed to have a good perception of sizes and distances. He described the UFO as' saucer-shaped, 150 feet in diameter, 50 feet in depth, with a vertical- \"wall\" about 10 feet wide separating the top and bottom halves. He judged the closest distances to be 300 yards away and 200 feet above the ground. Coufal thought the UFO was mov- ing about 10 mph steadily, with no wobble. It appeared smooth and metallic and its only light came from the setting sun. He wondered if there was some connection with hunters' reports that deer known to be in the area were gone. Afterwards, he saw a military jet fighter over the area of the sighting. Elaine Haggerty, another witness at the station, thought the UFO had a slight wobble. She described it as silver, metallic appearing with a pale yellow glow around it, not reflected light from the sun, and said it sudden- ly moved off at unbelievable speed â faster than anything she had ever seen. She noticed that other motorists pulling into the station .were asking if anyone there had seen'-what they had seen. One motorist also said he had just seen a large herd of deer crossing the highway.    â¢  : Three days later Bob Marshall's wife, Gwen, was looking out a\" large (continued on page 19) 17"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"Director's Message, Continued discount from the prices in his catalog. We hope that space will be devoted each month in the \"Director's Message\" to ideas and suggestions for our members so that they may be bet- ter qualified to represent MUFON and aim at becoming professionals in UFOlogy. Public Relations will be discussed this month, touching upon different areas. 1. Newspapers. Since there are more small-town daily and weekly newspapers than large city metro- politan publications, State Section Directors, Field Investigators, and Research Specialists should start in this area first, not only for the ex- perience, but also because they will find these editors to be more recep- tive to UFOs. Visit and cultivate the friendship of these editors, so that you may develop a two-way com- munication, whereby they will print UFO sighting reports and also refer sightings to you for investigation. In the larger cities, make an appoint- ment to visit with the City Editor, leaving your name, address, and telephone number, and emphasize the fact that you represent the Mutual UFO Network. It is important that you establish your credibility with these editors, because it is only in this manner that they will make referrals to you and seek your advice on reports via the wire services. 2. Radio and Television. Basically, the same steps are taken to get ac- quainted with the news directors, pro- gram directors, and news commen- tators at radio and television stations as newspapers, since they are all essential parts of the news media. Take advantage of the numerous radio talk programs by calling the host, especially if the subject is related to UFOs or if it is an \"open session\" where any subject is invited for discussion. Volunteer to participate as a guest on one of the talk programs, provided that you are prepared with the latest information on current sightings and have a good back- ground on the more important past cases, so that you may \"field\" ques- tions. Appearing as a guest represent- ing the Mutual UFO Network is a challenge, but not as difficult as it may seem at first glance. As a serious UFO investigator or researcher, your knowledge of the UFO phenomenon far exceeds that of the average person that will pose questions. Thus, you have a distinct advantage in providing intelligent answers to their questions. If you do not know the answer to a question or specific case brought up, do not hesitate to say so, but suggest that the person leave his name and telephone number with the station operator so you may call and answer the question \"off-the-air.\" 3. Wire Services. In the larger cities and metropolitan areas, get to know the representatives of the major wire services such as Associated Press (AP), United Press International (UPI), as well as the many syndicated ser- vices such as the New York Times Service, Washington Post Service, and Los Angeles Times Service. They usually rent office space from a large newspaper in your community, so are readily accessible to MUFON people. 4. Speakers Bureau. Church groups, schools, service clubs, youth groups, colleges and universities are always interested in securing speakers for their meetings, and the subject of UFOs is very popular. In order to be available to accept invitations to speak, prepare one or more speeches and/or slide-illustrated lectures. In all of your public appearances, invite the audience to share their UFO experiences with you in private, since this is a never-ending source of reports. Be constantly on the alert for volunteers to become involved in UFO investigations, research, and particularly knowledgeable people from industry and the academic com- munity who will consider becoming Consultants in their specific field of expertise. Utilize the newspapers and radio stations to announce the dates, times, and locations of local UFO study group meetings or activities in the case of visiting guest speakers. Also include a telephone number where additional information may be ob- tained. In all of your public relations con- tacts, invite interested people to join MUFON and subscribe to the MUFON UFO Joiinuil, since this is one of your most tangible educational tools. In summation, whether we call these particular procedures \"public relations\" or \"public education,\" they are all aimed at educating the general public to the scientific importance of understanding the UFO phenomenon and helping to resolve this perplexing enigma.

Two of the victims were found to be drained of blood. Mysterious underwater objects (\"phantom submarines\") are the topic of an article in the January 5 Enquirer. Swedish authorities claim that 68 such \"sub\" reports have occurred in their territorial waters since 1975. Excerpts from Budd Hopkins' book, Missing Time, are published in the January 12 and January 19 issues of Enquirer. The Virginia Horton case â' one of the book's most fascinating reports â is detailed. The Star for December 29 gives an account of a British policeman who underwent hypnotic regressions to bring out the story of his apparent ab- duction by UFO entities. UFO researcher Lee Speigel con- tributes an article to the \"Anti- Matter/UFO Update\" section of January OMNI. Speigel's report con- cerns radar-visual sightings of UFOs over Edwards Air force Base in California on October 7, 1965. Up to one dozen UFOs were seen over a period of 4 Vi hours. The same section of the February OMNI issue has an updated report on the CashyLandrum UFO event which occurred near Dayton, Texas on December 29, 1980. Allan Hendry's article in the February issue of Fate discusses the controversial \"star map\" allegedly seen by Betty Hill inside a UFO in 1961. Research by Marjorie Fish seemed to provide evidence that the Hills' captors hailed from Zeta 1 and 2 Reticuli. Hendry now asserts that a new astronomical technique (\"speckle interferometry\") has shown Zeta 2 Reticuli to be a binary star system, supposedly eliminating it from the category of stars having habitable planets. Considering the number of astronomical textbooks which have had to be re-written in recent years (based largely on discoveries in our own solar system), it seems a bit risky to speculate on conditions existing in other planetary systems. Also, Hen- dry seems quite reluctant to take any UFO abduction cases at face value, so this bias must be considered in evaluating his writings. The 1896-97 \"airship\" reports con- stitute one of the more fascinating episodes of UFO history, as I can per- sonally attest from having read liter ally hundreds of accounts from this period. It is unfortunate, therefore, that the first book to deal specifically with the airships is, at best, in- complete. If you are not familiar with the reports, Daniel Cohen's The Great Airship Mystery might prove helpful in providing a general background of the airship topic. But, to those who have familiarized themselves with the subject, the book will be something of a disappointment. Cohen has mere- ly rehashed the reports which have been found by various researchers, without having done any readily discernible probing of his own. In ad- dition, he omits pertinent details of several cases, while totally ignoring others which are fully as worthy of study. In his final summary, after rejecting the concepts of \"secret inventors\" and extraterrestrial visitors to explain the airship reports, Cohen asks, \"Can all of the thousands upon thousands of people who believed that they saw an airship in 1896 and 1897 have been utterly wrong? In my view the answer to that is yes.\" While I disagree with Cohen's conclusion, that is not my major objection to the book. I only wish it had been more complete, with a great deal of new material provided by the author. The book is available from: Dodd-Mead, 79 Madison Avenue, New York, NY 10016. The price is $9.95. Fate magazine is one of the pioneers in UFO reporting, having begun publication in 1948, less than a year after Kenneth Arnold's historic sighting of \"saucers\" in the Pacific Northwest. The first few issues car- ried Arnold's report of his observa- tions as well as his investigations into other cases. Since those early years, Fate has carried hundreds of articles on all aspects of the UFO subject. Publisher Gray Barker has recently put his computer to work and has come up with a reference work which will be of considerable value to researchers wishing to locate specific Fate UFO articles. A. UFO Guide to Fate is an 8Vi\" x 11\" (printed horizontally) spiral-bound publication which lists all the articles chronologically, by subject, by title, by author, etc. It also includes a list of book reviews from Fate, plus lists of typical illustrations, UFO photographs and advertise- ments.
