He was awake one cold morning about 6:30 olcLock, five or six years ago (he dfoesn't #recall the exact date) and went to the ,kitchen. Looking out the window, he saw an sbject like a human form about' 190 feet 'distant.% Mr.X says the -figure was about 2; to 3 feet .high and was -clad in- an olive drab suit whi'ch appeared to have a hel- met built into it. It ,s-eemed to be all head and body and Nr. X coulci not see any slits in the uniform that indlcate anxi and legs. There seemed to be a llfogt' around the figure. After gazing at it for perhaps five minutes, Mr. X dedided to outside for a closer look; He return- ed to \\his bedroom t'o dress and when he returned to the kitchcil to 1001.: out the window again, the ob.ject hfad disappeared; but the farm dog was on a three 'point stance sniffing at the ground where the figure' ha4 been seen.

Mr., Leon Worley, .zn electrical engineer, and his son, Paul, an emploxee at th~ Deca;ur \"Herzld and Reviewv Newsp~per office, saw an oval-shaped bright light the morning of July 22, 1970. . . Mr. Worley pn3 son h~d left thpir home at No. 7 Calumet Ro-d, ~ecatu--. Ill. ,at zbout E: r; ol:lnck, on thcir way to the newspaper office, when both.saw the bright object in the castern sky zbout 15 to 20 degrees nprLh of east, and 10 dcgrt es above the horizon. They had turnsd oa to Grove road and were driving east. Clouds could be seen on the distant horizon-and below the object. The'sun wzs just rising, aria no stars were visible in either the east,c?rn> or western sky. Af:ter continuing for a quartcr mile i-o the intersection with Highm: 51, they then drove north on 51 for zbout three miles and continued tc~ watch the object ,until it was lost to,sight behind the buildings in downtown Decatur. Mr. Worley did not -see the8 object again as he travel- ed south.of the city back-along the same route to his home. The biorleys described the object as being oval-shaped and a bright white light, about 2$ times ,the width in length. It appeared to be standing-on end and seemed to be stationary. On July 30, 1970, Mr. and Mrs. John Garren, of Decatur observed- a white light which they first thought to be a star, then cha::ged . their minds as more7detail was observed. Mr. Garren is employed at the A. E; Stzley Company plan$ and Mrs. Garren works at the Adolph Meyer-Zone Center in Decatur. They were riding in a rural area ?bout 9:lO PM when they first saw the white light west of their home and they tried to get closer to-it. They drove over various country roads west of oecatur for a distance of perhaps 20 miles. Mr. Garren made a sketch of the object which was a circle with a trianple (or cone) on top and another cone on the bottom. The llconell on top was awight .white light and the one on the bottom of the round object was red in color; and thev noticed the red lipht became brighter as the object moved, up and at times became -so brigh;; the entire obljecG2 seemed to turn red. The object zig-zagged-over a sma3l. arc of the sky, flying in. a, genfrally northwesterly direction 2nd brightened and dimmed-in no regular cycle. They compcred it in stie to the appErent sizk of the full moon; .or a coin held at armls.-length, and zppeared to be three times.as big and bright as the !evening star (Venus at thrt time) until-it disap,pearcd from sight into the northwest. Tlie Garrens determined the object was in motion by sighting it in reference to various stationery objects during their chase. At one time, when it was its biggest and brightest, the~~thought they might have been, within.a mile of it--but most of the time it was much furtktv- away, either hovering in one plzce for a time, or speeding eway in erratic fashion. The object was under observetion for an hour:and ten minutes. The investigator and reporter for the two sightings is Mr. Leonar? W. Sturm, of Decatur, Ill.

Briefly, it concerned a photo taken at the Flippin Airport on July 18, 1969, in which an apparerlt UFO is vis'ible. No unusual aerial objects were vis- ible to the n2kzd:eye at the tlme the photo was taken, but when the film was developed, the familiar \"domed disc\" shape was appsrent. On June 24, 1970 Mr. Herman Hazel, who lives near the eastern end 0; the runway at the Flipqin kirp~rt, saw another UFO. In an-interview' with Mr. Hazel on Julyv25, he described the object as approximately 50 feet iin diameter and like \"weathered aluminum71 in color. A bluish -' \"hazef1 seemed to surround the object. Again, the shape was'li'ke a',al1s? with a dome on top; Hazel first saw :the object; apparently hovering at about 350 feet4'<- bove the western end of the ,runway. After onlv a few seconds, i-t'-moved away.towzrd a mountaim WNW of the airport,' then di'sappeared upward a't terrifix speed. ' ~ 2 Upon first seeing-the UFO, Mr. Hazel -c?lled to his wife, who then . saw the object disappear: - No noise was heard during the sighting,, nor did the object leave a trail of any sort upon moving away. N,o photd- graphs were taken. In addltion to last &year's photo and this .recent sighting, some. other anomalous events have occurred at or near the Flippin Air~o-rt. On one occasion, a tower beacon beg'an revolving backwards; at another time, the same beacon seemed to be, emitting \"waves1' of light. There may be.no connecti:on .between these events and the UFO incidents, b?ut. they are mentioned so that-.possible correlations might .be drawn be'tween them and others'happening- elsewhere.

It should ,prove to be quite interesting. .

It was entitled THE'OFFICIAL GUIDE TO UFOs. and contained, some good material. It has now .been reprinted ,.in pa,perback from by, Ace ~ooks, with the same title.
