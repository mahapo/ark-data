We are indebted to Robert Todd for his diligent work in obtaining this valuable document and to Peter A. Gersten for providing a copy to MUFON. RUPPELT A brief review of the historical document titled Estimate of the Situation, classified TOP SECRET, is in order, especially for those who may be relatively new to Ufology. Probably one of the most reliable sources is Edward J. Ruppelt, former head of the Air Force Project Blue Book as related in his book, The Report on Unidentified Flying Objects (Doubleday, 1956). Quoting from page 41: \"In intelligence, if you have something to say about some vital problem you write a report that is known as an 'Estimate of the Situation.' A few days after the DC-3 was buzzed (Eastern Air Lines pilots Chiles and Whitted, July 24, 1948), the people at ATIC (Air Technical Intelligence Center,.Wright-Patterson AFB, Dayton Ohio) decided that the time had arrived to make an Estimate of the Situation. The situation was the UFO's the estimate was that they were interplanetary!\" EVOLUTION After the estimate was completed, typed and approved, it started up through channels to higher level echelons. When the Top Secret Estimate of the Situation reached the higher echelons of the Air Force, it got to the late General Hoyt S. Vandenberg, then Chief of Staff, before it was batted back down. The general wouldn't buy interplanetary vehicles, saying the report lacked proof. The estimate died a quick death. Some months later it was completely declassified and relegated to the incinerator. A few copies were kept as By Walt Andrus momentos of the golden days of UFOs. Captain Ruppelt saw one of these copies which he described as a thick document with a black cover and printed on legal-size paper. Stamped across the front were the words TOP SECRET. GORMAN In studying Project Sign's Air Intelligence Report No. 100-203-79, some of the identical UFO sightings are reported that Ruppelt relates in his book as appearing in the \"Estimate.\" The publishing date for the Estimate of the Situation was late Summer or early Fall, since it preceded Lt. George F. Gorman's dogfight with a lighted object over the airport at Fargo, North Dakota on October 1, 1948 (one of the classic cases of that era). Prior to Mr. Gorman's death, he lived in New Braunfels, Texas, only 14 miles from MUFON headquarters. My wife and I have had the pleasure of sharing his UFO experience over dinner on a few occasions. George was far from being convinced that he had been dueling with a lighted balloon for 27 minutes as the Air Force ultimately decided. His wife said he was \"white as a sheet\" when he arrived home a few minutes later after his harrowing encounter. SIGNIFICANCE The vital significance of Report No. 100-203-79 may be attributed to the evaluation of the UFO phenomenon as known in 1948 and the technical possibility that German scientists in Soviet Russia (U.S.S.R.) had developed and perfected a craft with the flight characteristics of a UFO after World War II. It is not surprising that ATIC personnel proposed that saucers were interplanetary in origin in their Estimate of the Situation. ACTION We are extremely fortunate that Report No. 100-203-79 did not surfer the same fate as the Situation by being destroyed. Two documents, declassified on January 29, 1985 and stamped CONFIDENTIAL, disclosed the designated action to be taken regarding this report. 1. Memo dated 11 August 1950 to CG, Alaskan Air Command from AFOIV-TC; Subject: Downgrad- ing of Air Intelligence Report No. 100-203-79. The response: Subject document, for which your Command requests downgrading action, contains info and speculation on the \"flying saucer\" situation which have never been released or intimated publicly by the Air Force. 2. Memo dated 25 September 1950 from Dept. of the Air Force Hqs. U.S. Air Force. Subject: Destruction of Air Intelligence Report Number 100-203-79. The instructions were: It is requested that action be taken to destroy all copies of Top ..Secret Air Intelligence Report Number 100- 203-79, subject \"Analysis of Flying Object Incidents in the U.S.,\" dated 10 Dec 1948. It was filed under: 313.6 Records, Destruction of 17 Oct 50. If the instructions, had been followed explicity, this report would have been destroyed. Will the FOIA requests being initiated recover a copy of the Estimate of the Situation that Captain Ruppelt saw in the Air Force file? EDITING The original copy of the report from the Directorate of Intelligence Headquarters United States Air Force and the Office of Naval Intelligence Navy Department contains 26 pages plus a cover and index. The copies of the photographs were of such poor quality that they have not been reproduced in this issue of the Journal. After extracting the majority of the UFO photographs, and flying wing-type . aircraft, the 26 pages were edited physically so as to retain the text of the report. Two photographs of flying-wing aircraft were substituted for the original rough copies for the benefit of Journal readers (YRB-49A and XF5U-1). It is unusual for MUFON to devote a monthly issue to one specific article or report. The editors feel that the significance of this report warrants maximum exposure. 3"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"ANALYSE OF FLYING OBJECT INCIDENTS IN THE U. 8. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS PROBLEM i 1. TO EXAMINE pattern of tactics of \"Flying Saucers\" (hereinafter referred to as flying objects) and to develop conclusions as to the possibility of existence. FACTS AND DISCUSSION 2. A DETAILED discussion of Information bearing on the problem as set forth above Is attached as Appendix \"A\". The main points established therein are summarized below. 3. THE FREQUENCY of reported incidents, the similarity In many of the characteristics attributed to the observed objects, and the quality of observers considered as a whole, support the contention that some type of flying object has been observed. Approximately 210 ^ivl'tontE have been reported. Among the observers reporting on such Incidents are trained -and experienced U.S. Weather Bureau personnel, USAF rated officers, experienced civilian pilots, technicians associated with various re- search projects and technicians employed by commercial alTllnoo 4. THE POSSIBILITY that reported observations of flying objects over the U.S. were Influenced by previous sightings of unidentified phenomena In Europe, particularly over Scandinavia in 1946, and that the observers reporting such incidents may have been Interested In obtaining personal publicity have been considered as possible explanations. However, these possibilities seem to be improbable when certain selected reports such as the one from U.S. Weather Bureau at Richmond are examined. During observations of weather baUoonn at the Richmond Bureau, one well trained observer has sighted strange metallic disks on three occasions and another observer has sighted a similar -object on one occasion. The last observation of unidentified objects was In April, 1M7. On all four occa-  j slons the weather balloon and the y*>»rt<»nttfi»rt objects were in view through the theodolite. These  : observations at the Richmond Bureau occurred several months before publicity on the flying saucers appeared in a U.S. newspaper.            { 6. DESCRIPTIONS OF the flying objects iall into three configuration categories: (1) disk-shaped (2) rough cigar-shaped (3) balls of fire. Varying conditions of visibility and differences in angles at which the objects may have been viewed introduces a possibility that a single type object may have been observed rather than three different types. This possibility is further substantiated by     • •> the fact that In the areas where such objects have been observed the ratio of the three general  j configurations Is fn'^KlniB+tly tV* same.      j 6. THEREFORE, IT appears that come object -has been seen; however, the Identification of thai  I object cannot be readily accomplished on the basis of information reported on each incident. It  1 is possible that the object, or objects, may have been domestically launched devices such as weather     _• balloons, rockets, experimental flying wing aircraft, or celestial phenomena. It is necessary to    • obtain information on such doTp*g**° activity to confirm or deny this possibility. Depending upon  \\ the degree -with which ibis may be accomplished, foreign devices must then be considered as a  j possibility. 7. THE PATTERN of sightings is definable. Sightings have been -most intense throughout the states \\ bordering the Atlantic and Pacific coast lines, and the central states of Ohio and Kentucky. A map showing location of sightings is attached as Appendix \"B\" -40P t.CRi»"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"8. THE ORIGIN of the devices is not ascertalnable. There are two reasonable possibilities: (1) The objects are domestic devices, and if so, their identification or origin can be established by a survey of all launchlngs of airborne objects. Domestic flying wing type aircraft observed in various aspects of flight might be responsible lor some of the reported flying objects, particu- larly those described as disks and rough cigar shapes. (See Appendices \"C\" and \"D\".) Among those which have been operational in recent years are the XF5U-1 C'Flylng Flapjack\") developed by Chance-Vaught, the Northrup B-36, and the turbo-jet powered Northrup YB-40. The present existence of any privately developed Dying-wing type aircraft has not been determined but one such aircraft, the Arup tailless monoplane, was operational at South Bend, Indian^ prior to 1036. (2) Objects are foreign, and if so, it wotild seem most logical to consider that they are from a Soviet source. The Soviets possess information on a number of German flying-wing type aircraft such as the Ootha P60A, Junkers EF ISO long-range, high-speed Jet bomber and the Horten 229 twin-Jet fighter, which particularly resembles some at the description of unidentified Dying objects (See Appendix \"D\"). As early as 1924 Tscheranowsky developed a \"Parabola\" aircraft, an all wing design, which was the outcome of considerable Soviet experimentation with glidera of the same general form. Soviet aircraft based on such designs might have speeds approaching trans- sonic speeds attributed to some flying objects or greater over-all performance •MiimiTig the successful developmeat of some unusual propulsion device such as atomic energy engine. 6. THAT THE Soviets have a current interest In flying-wing type aircraft is suggested by their utilisation of Dr. Guenther Bock who, at the end of World War 11, was in charge of the flying- wlng program in Germany £>ee Appendix \"A\", paragraph 3, page 4). Achievements satisfactory to the U.S.S.R. are indirectly indicated by the personal recognition he is reported to be receiving in the U.S.S.R. Recently it has been reported that the U.S.S.R. is planning to build a fleet of 1,600 Horten Dying-wing aircraft. Information of low evaluation has been received stating that a regiment of Jet night fighters, Model Horten Xm, is at Kuzmikha, an air base two miles south- west of Irkutsk. Kuzmikha is identified as one of a number of airfields for the protection of an atomic energy plant at Irkutsk. The Horten XHI as developed by Germany was a glider. 10. ASSUMING THAT the objects might eventually be identified as foreign or foreign-sponsored devices, the possible reason for their appearance over the U.S. requires consideration. Several possible explanations appear •noteworthy, viz:   , . . a. To negate -U.S. confidence in the atom bomb as the most advanced and decisive weapon In warfare. b. To perform photographic reconnaissance missions. c. To test U. S. air defenses. d. To conduct familiarization flights over U.S. territory. CONCLUSIONS 11. SINCE the Air Force is responsible for control of the air in the defense of the VJB., It is imperative that all other agencies cooperate in confirming or denying the\"possibility that these objects have a domestic origin. Otherwise, if It Is firmly indicated that there is no domestic explanation, the objects are a threat and warrant more active efforts of identification and inter- ception. 12. IT MUST be accepted that some type of flying objects have been observed, although their identification and origin are not discernable. In the interest of national defense U would be unwise to overlook the possibility that some of these objects may be of foreign origin. - 2 -"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"APPENDIX \"A\" ANALYSIS OF FLYING OBJECT INCIDENTS IN THE U. S. AND HYPOTHETICAL TACTICS EMPLOYED 1. INTRODUCTION. To formulate the possible tactics of flying objects reported over the TJ. S. assumes from the outset that firm conclusions have been reached on both the existence and origin of the reported flying objects. The current status of Information on such Incidents and over-all analysis .does not allow substantiation for such conclusions. However, the lack of such firm con- clusions points to the necessity for an Immediate and* sound statistical analysis of every aspect of the situation «nd does not preclude a concurrent examination of the reported incidents to develop explanations of their possible tactics. The latter will be useful at some future date should the existence and origin of the flying objects be definitely established. Therefore, the following analy- sis of available Information . Is advanced In order to present evidence on the actual existence of some type flying object and to relate same i to tactical purposes \"for which the objects are possibly designed. The following discussion must be considered a provisional analysis, pending a further detailed analysis of all aspects of the problem. 2. SOME ASPECTS REGARDING 'FLYING OBJECT INCIDENTS. A cursory examination of evidence on reported incidents has been made and it le possible to cite certain generalities which U appears may be borne out when detailed analyses have been completed. Among the Incidents reported there mre many statements by reliable and experienced persons which tend to confirm that flying objects nave been seen. The description of such objects seems ' to fall roughly Into three categories: (1) Silver disks or balls, approximating a \"Horten wing type aircraft; (2) Balls of fire of various colors and Intensities; (9) Cigar or pencil-shaped objects similar In appearance to V-2 type rockets In horizontal flight. The numbers of configurations might be further reduced with the following considerations in mind: Silver disks or balls have, lor the' greater part, been observed in daylight and a number under clear weather conditions with visibility unlimited. In most Instances, tells of fire have been observed at night. Cigar, or pencil-shaped objects have been sighted in fewer numbers but -with about equal distribution in daylight and at night. A few accounts tell of the disks having a rough cigar-shape when. viewed while maneuvering. Some of the disks are described as having luminosity in daylight. It there- fore is possible that a single type of object may be involved in all sightings, and differences in description may result irom viewing the objects at various angles and tmder differing conditions of visibility. The above tends to indicate that some type object has been seen and the possibility exists that the object or objects seen are conventional domestic devices, such as weather balloons, test rockets, or Jet-equipped aircraft with pancake or flying wing configurations. The possibility exists thp* the reporting of flying objects may have been influenced by earlier reports on similar incidents In Scandinavia and Central Europe. The publication In newspaper of details on such Incidents, both foreign and domestic, may have induced wome of the description provided in reported -domestic incidents. However, one of the earliest reported sightings in the U£. was the one observed by UJB. Weather Bureau personnel in April 1947, at Richmond, Virginia, and on the basis of this one report It appears that the disks are not balloons. It would seem that this sighting was not influenced by the reports of lorelgn incidents, the newspaper accounts of domestic incidents, nor by mlsldentUlcatlon of a conventional object."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"Although reported domestic incidents are widely scattered throughout the U.S., frequency of sighting and number of observers per sighting assumes a definable pattern. There IB a large con- centration of sightings along the Eastern Seaboard; another large concentration throughout the Western Coast states, and a few sightings in the Middle West. Distribution of incidents by con- figuration of object and description of maneuverability is approximately equal In each of these areas and this Is believed to further substantiate the possibility that one type of object might have been observed In different aspects of flight. B sightings are induced by rumor, it seems umimiH] that more incidents have not been reported from the areas with high concentration of population. 'Reports from such areas would also have greater facility in fKammiing either to newspaper or official reporting agencies. For the most part, sightings have been made in fairly open country where there are lew restrictions to visibility, which may indicate that obstructed vision has reduced sightings In built-up areas. It therefore seems that some type of Hying object has been observed, the idenUflnatlor of its origin requires the competion of other analyses. 3. POSSIBLE ORIGDj OF UNUSUAL FLYING OBJECTS. Provided, upon the completion of analyses, it Lt indicated that some or all of the reported hying objects over the U.S. are of foreign origin, the objects could from a logical viewpoint, be considered Soviet. Jt is evident from the perform- ance characteristics attributed to the unidentified objects .at this time that if they are .foreign, they involve efficiencies of performance which have not been realized In any operational airborne device in this country. It would, therefore, be a mistake to analyse the technical aspects of the situation within the limits of our own knowledge of practical developments. It is more desirable to consider then the outer limits of possible Soviet developments and objectives in attempting to formulate some idea of the tactics which might be Involved. First of all, the scientific objectives of -the U.SJ5.R. have been stated many times and indicated in many forms. The most clearcut statement of this objective is probably the one contained in the preamble to the Fourth Five-year Plan (1946-1960) which states that the objective of Soviet science is to overtake and surpass the scientific and technical developments of the capitalist nations. It apparently would be an Impossible task for the Soviet Union to accomplish such an objective bj pro- ceeding step-by-step along the same lines of development already achieved in -the capitalist nations. This would mean that Jl would be necessary to rapidly proceed through each phase of aeronautical development that has already been accomplished in this country, and this probably would never have any prospects of accelerating Soviet development beyond any point reached by the U.S. The obvious answer to accomplish their objective of not only overtaking, tut surpassing the capitalist countries would be a scientific shortcut. This possibility is not so remote when examined on the Jbasls of our knowledge oi the current situation in the TJ.S.S.R. Provided Soviet emphasis was given to the most promising and advanced ideas acquired from Germany Jn 1946 and the work aided by German scientists, the possibility of ^y+fhiT^ up * nf i possibly surpassing other nations In •tyhnl'*-ftl develop- ments becomes more realistic.. It becomes even more realistic if the Soviets have shown a tendency to concentrate on certain developments which have still not received a mail mum of priority 4n our own programs. It J0 known that the U.S.S.R. has since 1MB enlisted the services of Dr. Ouenther Bock., a German who headed all -development of low aspect .ratio {flying -wing) type aircraft in Germany. Dr. Bock is believed to be the top German scientist in charge at TSAGI and TS1AM which are \".Air Material Command\" type organizations in the U.S.B.R. Further, it is believed that Hr. Bock has made available all German plans for flying wing type aircraft to the Soviets. Among the de- signs considered by the Germans and possibly exploited by the U.B.S.R., are Jet-propelled, flying wing type aircraft whose configuration would be similar to descriptions of certain -objects reported flying over the UJB. The estimated speeds of such aircraft are within range of the lower limit* of speed attributed to Hying objects over the U.8. It is .not impossible that emphasis on*urpassing foreign developments has led to Mnw»^ progress In fuels and propulsion by the U<£JB JV. In con- nection with possible advancements in the field of fuels and propulsion, It should be observed thai - 4 -"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"the Russian oil situation (regardless of estimated oil reserves) Ifi quite different from that In the U.S. For example, U.S. oil Industry Is prepared to turn out tremendous quantities of highly frac- tionated petroleum products, while the U.S.S.R. cannot reasonably approach such capabilities This consideration dictates different solutions on fuels lor propulsion In the two countries and In turn, dictates the direction taken In development at Jet motors or the use of other propulsive devices. We must therefore, arrive at the conclusion that any Soviet device which may have made Its appearance over the U.8. as described, would possess unusual performance characteristics, which, In all probability, would Include unusual range. The possibility that they could have been launched at fairly close range should not be discarded.  '•••\"., 4. POSSIBLE REASONS .OR TACTICS FOR THE USE OF SOVIET \"UNCONVENTIONAL AIRCRAFT THE V£. Predicated on all the foregoing assumptions, Soviet unconventional aircraft may have been flown over the U.S. for one, all, or a combination of the following reasons: a. TO NEGATE U.S. CONFIDENCE IN ATOM BOMB AS THE MOST ADVANCED AND DECISIVE WEAPON. If the objects have been used in a propaganda sense, It would be reasonable to assume that the Soviets would choose first to frighten pro-American nations In Europe with the appearance  . of a radically new weapon to counteract the ability of the U.S. to obtain full propaganda effective- ness with the atom bomb. , It will be remembered that strange objects first appeared over the > Scandinavian countries In 1946. The objects observed there had unusual range and unusual per- formance characteristics. .As this demonstration over the Scandinavian countries occurred the U.S. was making a vigorous campaign for the economic and political alignment of these nations with other pro-American Western Europ>eah nations. When these incidents subsided, strange flying objects began to be observed at an increasing rate over the U.S. The conclusion on this point is •that flying objects may have been used to frighten both European nations and the U.S. by the appear- ance erf a new device, and that failure 'to Identify such a Soviet object would give them Invaluable Indication that U.S. development Is far behind that of the Soviets. Except for this indication, It is believed that the use of the objects to promote fear has been worthless in that the U.S. public has tended to characterize these Incidents entirely as hallucinations by \"crack pots\", mlsidentlfication of conventional objects, or that they represent a secret American project which should not be pub- licized. Any fear that might result from Soviet use will come only by a discovery that the objects . have been Soviet aircraft and that they involve radical developments which are In advance of cur own. accomplishments. ••'  \"'.'  •'<•\"-  .  .•'•..   '•\".'-. ' : ' b: FOR PHOTOGRAPHIC' .RECONNAISSANCE. It Is possible that the Soviets have employed the flying objects for the collection of photographic Intelligence or the mapping of certain areas In the • U.S. The evasive action employed by all objects sighted Indicates not so much an attempt to avoid being sighted, as an attempt to prevent disclosure of the exact type of flying craft and Its mission. The sighting of objects over the U.S. has been most intense In Eastern and Western Coastal States. In addition, sightings of flying objects have been made near Oak Ridge, Tenn., Las Cruces, N. W., .  ' and in the general area of 'the Hanford Works in Oregon, Generally, sightings have not been made  ' over what we consider strategic industrial areas. The reason for this, might be either that the flying objects have been observed only enroute to or from, missions over these more concentrated strategic areas, or that the Soviets obtained sufficient information during their World War H liaison  ,, | with U.S. industry to satisfy their intelligence requirements and have a more active requirement   : for information on industries and areas which were not available to them during World War II con- | tacts. This is of Interest In connection with the sightings near Oak Ridge, -Las Cruces, end in the general area of the Hanford Works since these establishments were not, and are not, accessible to ] Soviet collectors of photographic intelligence.      •' { c. TEST OF U. S. DEFENSES. It is possible, that the use of Soviet flying objects over the TJ.S.  ' Is intended only to determine the ability of the UJ3. defenses to spot foreign aircraft. This would .   ,- n be of extreme importance to the UJ5.S.R. in the event that a one-way all-out attack of Soviet strate-   ,; gic bombers is planned. Ability to operate over the U.S. uninhibited at a time when the U. S. is    : supposedly re-arming and putting great stress on defenses would provide valuable information on which to base estimates for probability of success In bombing strategic objectives in the U. 6."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"d. FAMILIARIZATION FLIGHTS OVER U.S. TERRITORY. This possible reason Is perhaps the most Improbable. It Is assumed that, should thl£ purpose be Involved, other purposes are prob- ably also accomplished in Its execution. Provided the U.S.S.R. has unusually high performance aircraft they might find It advantageous to familiarize themselves with the topography of the U.S. in anticipation of future combat \"''f'Jonf to strategic targets. 6. CONCLUSION. The conclusion that some type of flying object has been observed over the U£. seems to be substantiated. It Is not known at this time whether these observations are mlsldentlfl- catlons of domestically launched devices, natural phenomena, or foreign unconventional aircraft. It Is, therefore, impossible to make any reliable explanation for their appearance over the U.S. or the tactics which they may employ If the objects observed Include any foreign developments In aero- nautical fields. It Is likewise Impossible at this time to contain discussions of possible perform- ance characteristics or tactics within limits of practical reason, if for no other reason **M»\" the fact that proof of the existence of a foreign development of this type would necessarily Introduce considerations of new principals and means not yet considered practical possibilities in our own research and development.

Doling April 1947, two employees of the Weather Bureau Station at TM*tmi«pd Virginia re- ported seeing a strange »»«t«nt/> disk on three occaslona through the theodolite while making PIBAL observations. One observation was at 16,000 leet when a disk -was followed for 15 seconds. The disk appeared \"^taiiir, shaped »rm»tMn£ ID» u sUlpseiwlth « Hat bottom and a round top. It appeared below the balloon and was much larger in slxe. The disk appeared to be moving rather rapidly, although it was impossible to •ntlmata its speed. The other observations were made at 27,000 feet in like manner. b. The following mooth,^pBBslB^0MMt * field engineer for Radio Corporation of America, reported a disk flying near his home in •Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. The object was thought to be at an altitude between 10,000 feet and 18,000 feet, and was moving toward the north at a high rate of speed, leaving no trailing effects. c. While flying at 10,000 feet on a coarse of 300 degrees, SO miles northwest of Lake lyieade, Nevada, an Air Force lieutenant reported seeing five or six white circular objects in close forma- tion sad -traveling at an estimated speed of 285 miles per hour. This sighting occurred on 28 June 4. The following day a party of three, two of them scientists, were motoring along Highway 17 toward the White Sand, New Uexlco, V-2 firing •grounds and reported seeing a large disk or sphere moving horizontally at a high speed and an estimated altitude of 10,000 feet. It was of uniform shape and had no protruding surfaces such as wings. The object was in sight lor about 60 seconds before It disappeared to the northeast. The three observers agreed on the details of the sighting except that one thought As. had seen vapor trails. e.

It was very high and fact, and appeared to *XflCTtff violent maneuvers at high speed. The object was under observation for approximately SO seconds and disappeared suddenly. m. A yellow or light colored sphere, 25 to 40 feet In diameter was reported by Lt. Comdr. Marcus L. Lowe, USN, just south of Anacostla Naval Air Station, B.C., while he was flying on 30 April 1946. It was moving at a speed of approximately 100 miles per hour at an attitude of about 4,600 feet. Although winds aloft were from the north-northwest, Its course was to the north. n. On 1 July 1948^ twelve disks were reported over the Rapid City Air Base by Major Hammer. These disks were oval-shaped, about 100 feet long, flying at a speed estimated to be in excess of 500 mph.

On 17 July 1948, a report from Kirtland Air Force Base describes a sighting in the vicinity. of San Acacia, New Mexico, of seven unidentified objects flying In a \"J\" formation at an estimated height of 20,000 feet above the terrain. The formation varied from \"J\" to \"L\" to circle after pausing the Eenlth. Flashes from the objects were observed after passing 30 degrees beyond the ranUb but there was no smoke or vapor trail. £ the reported altitude is correct the, speed was estimated at 1,500 miles per hour, according to the report. p. Other sightings of lights and trails, rather than disks, have bean reported, viz: (1) On 12 September 1947, the pilot and co-pilot of a Pan American aircraft, «n route from Midway to Honolulu, saw a blue-white light approaching, fh»ne in g to twin reddish glows upon withdrawal. The pilot **\"™n««d the speed of the light at about 1,000 knots. (2) On 16 June 1948, \"Ui^jjgjjjff^ territory manager for the B.F.

This glowing light made no sound, traveled about twice the speed of a conventional aircraft and flew from noth to south several times in a wide arc, finally disappearing over the horizon. q. During the early morning of 25 July 1948, two Eastern Airlines pilots reported having seen a huge flying craft similar to a V-2 pass their aircraft in flight. (See Figs. 7 and 8.) The attached drawinge made by these two ^observers very closely resemble a flying object reported to have been seen on 20 July 1946, by^tfNMHMt cuief investigator of Court of Damage Inquiry, and hie daughter at Arnham, Netherlands:. This object appeared to be a wingless aircraft having two decks. The craft, sighted four times through scattered clouds and unlimited visibility, was travel- ing at high speed at a nigh altitude. A sound similar to that made by a V-2 was reported. r. An object, similar in shape to the one in the preceding incident was reported by an experienced American newspaper reporter about 25 kilometers northeast of Moscow on 3 August. 1MB. A Russian acquaintance identified it as a rigid airship but the reporter disagrees because it flew at a high, but not excessive speed. s. On 1 October 1946 at approximately 2030 hours the pilot of a F-61 aircraft, 2nd Lt. George F. Gorman (North Dakota Air National Guard), flying near Fargo, North Dakota, sighted an Inter- mittent white light about 3,000 feet below his 4,500 feet cruising altitude.

Tbe same light was observed by three^ptber witnesses from the ground: Ue.lfggafmgm. Air Traffic Controller, Mr. tHHHBOB0ftf Assistant Traffic Con- troller, and Dr^plHMhV. Oculist. A comparlaon of all testimony revealed that one object was sighted and that It consisted only of a small round ball of clear white light with no apparent shape attached. It was about 6 to 8 inches in dlamter. At times It traveled faster than the 7-61 . and performed maneuvers in an evasive manner. When first sighted the ball of light was travel- Ing at an estimated 250 miles per hour. Under this condition, the light was not continuous but blinked off -and on. At high performance toe white light was continuous. Subsequent investigation eliminated the possibility that this incident may have been soother aircraft or a meteorological balloon. t. Co 18 November 1948 at approximately 2145 hours, three reserve pilots, 2nd Lt. Kenwood W. Jackson, 2nd Lt. Glen L. Stalker, and 2nd Lt. Henry G. Combs, flying near Andrews Field, Maryland, encountered an unidentified flying object. When first sighted, it appeared to be lighted and flying at about 1,700 feet. Three or four passes were made In an attempt to identify it. The pilot of the aircraft stated that while diving his aircraft si approximately 240 miles per hour, the object would fitmh vertically and then would drop below the aircraft from behind and continue to circle. On the, last pass, the landing light was switched on and momentarily a dull gray glow from the object was observed. Lt. Combs stated he maintained contact for about ten minutes with the object flying between the lights of Washington, D. C. and his aircraft. All that could be observed was an oblong ball with one light, no wings and no exhaust flame. It finally made a very tight torn and headed toward the east coast at an estimated 600 to 600 miles per hour. At the same time Staff Sergeant John J. Kushner observed from the ground an unusual object In the air over Andrews Field. He stated that it was not very high and that it did not look like an aircraft. 3. REPORTS OF radar Intercepts point to unusual air activity which may be related to flying objects. a. On 1 July 1947, a OCA radar at Hokkaido, Japan picked up an unidentified target at 16 miles, with a speed in excess of 500 mph. This target split into two targets, each estimated to be larger than a P-51. b. On 16 September 1947, an MEW radar at Fukuoka, Japan, picked up a target at 69 miles and trailed It to 19 miles, where It faded. Speed was 840-900 mph. The speed measurement, made by a good crew through a,70-mile track, is believed accurate. 4. Investigations conducted by Headquarters, Air Materiel Command, have definitely established the identification of 16 of approximately 210 so-called flying saucers which have been reported. Approximately nine per cent of the total number of incidents are, therefore, eliminated from further specific consideration. Among those incidents positively explained, three were hoaxes, two were from unreliable witnesses. In the remaining 13 eliminated incidents, objects were actually seen but investigation has shown that they were celestial bodies or phenomena, meteoro- logical and carnival balloons, and airborne cosmic ray experimental equipment. The following examples are presented for comparison of the information reported by witnesses and true identifi- cation of the object involved: a. On 22 July 1948, Captain Henry Glover (Ordnance Reserve) and his wife observed at Van Nuys, California, an object which they were unable to positively Identify. Object at first appeared to be round and looked like a weather balloon at about 2,000 feet but there was no characteristic bobbing. The wind was blowing on the ground but the object was quite steady. During the time it was under observation, about an hour, it traveled through a vertical arc of about twenty-five (25°) degrees or more. Tbe observer concluded that it was not a celestial body. It has a bluish luminescence and as the sun set, the object's color gradually changed to orange at dusk and ceased to be illuminated almost instantaneously. The outline was clear and the air was clear with visibility unlimited. The object traveled from the east to the west. This object was determined by investigation to have been a balloon carrying cosmic ray equipment. . 16 - 15"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"b. On 1& August 1948, at approximately 1050 hours an unidentified flying object was visible from the ground at Godman Air .Force Base, Kentucky. This object was estimated to be at about 30,000 to 40,000 feet altitude, spherical In shape, bright silver color and gave a bright reflection from the sun. An F-61 was dispatched from Standlford Air Force Base, Kentucky, to observe the object. During observation from the ground, there was no change In the elevation of the object and It seemed to be moving southwest from Godman Air Force Base. The F-61 which was flying over Godman AFB at an altitude of 30,000 to 36,000 feet reported that It was unable to locate the object although It was still visible from the ground with the naked eye. Azimuth and •elevation readings were taken by theodolite every minute and the path of the object was charted. The object was determined to be the planet Venus by Mr. Moore, the head astronomer at the University of Louisville, Louisville, Kentucky. It Is believed that earlier Incidents at Godman Field (reference paragraph 2k, page 12, Appendix \"C\") may also have been observations of the planet Venus. 5. AMONG THOSE Incidents still not positively explained, reported observations differ to some extent, but three general categories of sightings emerge — the flying disk, the ball of fire and the large jet rocket. Interesting observations that were noted are: a. Most of the objects are a thin disk, round on top and flat on the bottom. The front half of the disk Is often circular, sweeping back to a square tail across the full width. b. A high rate of climb as well as the apparent ability to remain motionless or hover for a considerable length at time is indicated. c. Reported sizes have varied from that of a 25-cent piece to 250 feet In diameter, and from the size at a pursuit plane to the bulk of six B-29 airplanes. d. Speeds have been estimated throughout the entire range from very slow or hovering to supersonic. e. Sounds and visual trails are not normally associated with the sightings. - 16 - Fig. 1 16"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"APPENDIX \"D' FLYING WING TYPE AIRCRAFT 1.

Webb MUFON Astronomy Consultant AUGUST 1985 Bright Planets (Evening Sky) Saturn, in Libra, is now low in the SW during twilight, setting about 11:30PM Daylight Time. Jupiter, retrograding westward in Capricornus, reaches a point opposite the sun on the 4th, rising in the ESE at sunset and remaining visible all night. This largest of planets now shines at its brightest (magnitude -2.4). Bright Planets (Morning Sky): Our brilliant planet neighbor Venus rises about 2:45 AM in midmonth and is well up in the east before sunrise. Shining at magnitude -3.5, it appears only 2 and 3/4° north of telescopic Halley's Comet on August 1. Late in the month ruddy Mars reappears dimly very low in the east at dawn. Jupiter sets in the WSW at sunrise. Meteor Shower: The year's best meteor display, the Perseids, runs from about July 25 to August 18, peaking on the morning of the 12th at a rate of about one meteor per minute toward dawn. A waning crescent moon that morning interferes somewhat. Perseid meteors are swift, yellow, bright, and often leave smokelike trains behind them. Halley's Comet: Now is the time for amateur astronomers with medium-to-large telescopes to begin looking for Comet Halley, the most eagerly awaited astronomical event of this century. Rising in the eastern sky between 2 and 3 AM, the still distant comet will appear telescopically as a tiny dim 13th-magnitude smudge in the upraised club of Orion the Hunter. Avoid the full moonlight by searching around the middle of the month. The comet's position on the 15th is R.A. 6h Olm, Dec. +19° 07' (Epoch 1950) near the star Chi 2 Orionis. Halley will not be visible with the naked eye until December or January.

(Home Box Office) to produce a current UFO documentary for their national cable television service. MUFON has been working with Mr. Fred Rosen, the producer, for several months planning this important film contribution. The majority of the field interview filming was done during the week of May 28 through June 2nd, starting in Albuquerque, N. Mex., followed by Houston, Tex., New Orleans, La., New York, and finishing in Boston, Mass. In this brief and timely announcement, no attempt will be made to review the many significant UFO cases that were filmed or the names of the numerous people who contributed their time and resources to make this documentary not only entertaining, but an educational film of professional caliber for the fifteen million viewers who subscribe to this service. * * * Mr. Rosen has advised that H.B.O. plans to show their new film, tentatively titled \"UFOs: What's Going On,\" during the month of August 1985, so watch your published HBO schedule for showing times in your area. Since MUFON members played a major part in this production, we want to thank each and everyone of you for your cooperation and enthusiasm. This film has the potential of being one of the most significant UFO documentaries produced to date. My Director's Message has been confined to this one important announcement, due to space limitations, in order to publish the majority of Air Intelligence Report No. 100-203-79 titled \"Analysis of Flying Objects Incidents in the U.S.,\"dated 10 December 1948. August evenings bring the Summer Traingle high overhead.
