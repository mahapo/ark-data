FROM THE EDITOR If,\" you were unable to attend the 18th annual MUFON Symposium in Washington this past June, my lead article on the subject should bring you up to date. Since so much was going on and it was impossible to be in two places simultaneously, I've no doubt left out some names and events, for which I apologize. Everyone in the hosting Fund for UFO Research deserves a round of applause for their tireless hours put in, along with the visiting Larry Koss, who pitched in to plug leaks wherever they popped up. Mr. Jun-Ichi Yaoi, managing director of the Foundation for Earth Environment, Tokyo, should also be mentioned for filling us in on Japanese ufology.

Hosted by the Fund for UFO Research, the 18th annual MUFON Symposium was held on the campus of American University in the northwest quadrant of Washington, DC, the weekend of June 26-28, 1987. The official theme was \"International Symposium on Unidentified Aerial Phenomena: 1947 - 1987,\" a commemoration of four decades of worldwide UFO reports, dating back to Kenneth Arnold's landmark sighting in the summer of 1947. But the unofficial impetus, emblazoned in black letters on yellow souvenir buttons, was \"Forty Years Is Long Enough!\" Expectations were high that this would not be just another insular get- together of civilians interested in UFOs, but an occasion to reach out and touch the surrounding power structure, comprised of both influential media and government personnel. At this early date not all of the fallout can be measured, but the geiger counter was definitely ticking. Press passes were issued to reporters from Tass, the Peoples' Republic of China, the Warsaw, Poland, daily newspaper, an ABC-TV documentary program film crew from Los Angeles, a senior editor at OMNI, New York's Newsday, and writers working for the Boston Globe and Neu; York Times Sunday magazines, among others. At least one Senator, Clayborn Pell, from Rhode Island, was in attendance; and Bruce Maccabee, Stanton Friedman, Walt Andrus and others, were able to address a meeting of Congressional aides. Two major press conferences were held. Moreover, speakers from most of the seven continents were on hand to report on UFO activity from their respective areas. Whatever the UFO phenomenon represents, and most likely it's a plethora of probabilities, it is not a solely American abberation. For a world public weaned on Spielberg spectaculars that may yet come as a surprise. Friday night saw a reception held at the Mary Graydon Center on campus, diagonally across the Quad from the Ward Circle Building where exhibits were set up and the main speeches presented! While a summer thunderstorm raged outside, early arrivals mingled in comfort inside, enjoying snacks, drinks and renewed or freshly made acquaintances. When you can barely hear yourself speak in a big hall, you know the conversation is both enthusiastic and energetic. Some of that enthusiasm dimmed slightly Saturday morning when Ward Circle was unavailable and the symposium had to start in the college gym instead, an unairconditioned barn whose wooden floors bounced sounds off ceilings and walls like they were audible basketballs. Opening remarks by both MUFON's International Director and the Fund's chairman, Bruce Maccabee, could be made out, but just barely. The first paper of the day was presented by Temple University historian Dr. David Jacobs, who was followed by Italy's Dr. Roberto Pinotti, general secretary of the Centre UFOlogico Nazional of Florence. By then, sweltering heat and a failing sound system had driven half the audience of 400 to 450 outside. At this point the proceedings were halted until the original auditorium became available and things began to flow more smoothly. Dr. Pinotti deserves our apologies and congratulations for carrying on courageously in the face of conditions that were hardly conducive of attentive listening to say the least. ARNOLD TO HYNEK Jacobs, author of The UFO Controversy in America, said \"the history of UFOs in the United States can be divided into two distinct phases: the first was the attempt to prove the existence of the phenomenon as anomalous and to have it achieve scientific and public legitimacy. The second phase is the investigation of the internal motives of the intelligence behind the phenomenon. \"The first phase,\" he added, \"began with Kenneth Arnold's sighting in the summer of 1947. It ended in 1986, with the death of J. Allen Hynek, a year before the publication of Budd Hopkins' Intruders: The Incredible Visitations at Copley Woods.\" Jacobs called Intruders a \"monumentally important book...which for the first time publicly reveals the extent of the UFO phenomenon's intrusion into the personal lives of humans.\" Its publication marks the beginning of the second phase, the realization of the importance of the abduction phenomenon. As for where we are now, Dr. Jacobs noted that \"we have at least advanced beyond the sighting report. The material developed from the abduction accounts'has unequivocably placed us in the study of extraterrestrial life, motivations, intentions and activities. We may be on the threshhold of momentous discoveries. Going through that threshhold could intellectually lead us to another universe.\" ITALIAN UFOS Dr. Roberto Pinotti next reviewed forty years of UFO activity and research initiating from the underbelly of Europe. After a false start or two, the various Italian UFO groups met in September of 1965 to form a National Center for UFO Studies (Centre Unico Nazionale, or CUN) based largely on America's NICAP, or National Investigation Committee on Aerial Phenomena. Since then, CUN, like most civilian UFO organizations around the"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"world, has celebrated its successes and suffered its failures, which at one point included the publication by an offshoot group, in English, of UFO Phenomena, \"an international annual review, devoted to the scientific study of UFO phenomena.\" CUN's greatest lasting contribution was probably simply lending ufology respectability in the eyes of the Italian public. For much of the Seventies^ Italian ufology was mostly paralyzed until a landing case and close encounter wave struck the peninsula in 1978. Even then the aftereffects were the adoption, by many groups, of the nouvelle vogue, or \"new wave,\" of UFO interpretation which first surfaced in France and soon spread to other European countries. This new wave, said Pinotti, was characterized by \"socio-psychological\" explanations of the UFO phenomenon which sought to deny or downplay its physical aspects altogether. The new generation had their greatest impact (and some say most embarrassing fiasco) with the publication of La Grande Peur Martienne, \"The Great Martian Scare,\" by Gerard Barthel and Jacques Brucker (1979), followers of \"converted\" French ufologist Michel Monniere. Essentially, The Great Martian Scare was a revisionist demolition of the famous French Wave of 1954, publicized by Jacques Vallee and others, which for the first time marked the widespread appearance of UFO humanoid and landing cases. Following the 1978 wave, which included police and carab/enen photographs, military pilot sightings, and numerous reports of submerged objects from the so-called \"Adriatic Triangle,\" the Italian government, said Pinotti, \"officially charged the Air Force to keep the whole UFO question under control.\" Today, he added, \"CUN stands prepared to share its 20 years of UFO investigative experience with fellow American ufologists.\" FRENCH UFOLOGY As matters stand today, the only government-funded UFO organization in the world is France's GEPAN, an acronym for Unidentified Aerospace Phenomena Study Group, a division of the French National Space Agency, 4 DR. ROBERTO PINOTTI which was first founded in 1977. A similar idea proposed to President Jimmy Carter in this country, and to be funded by NASA, eventually came to nought. The summary of GEPAN's original aims and subsequent findings was provided in the first of the Saturday afternoon sessions by Mr. Jean Jacques Velasco, the group's present director. In its initial incarnation, GEPAN, under the guidance of statistician Claude Poher, had to decide between two very different approaches to the UFO phenomenon. \"Would it attempt to answer the questions put forth by the general public,\" asked Velasco, \"questions that often related unidentified phenomena to discussions of extraterrestrial intelligence? Or would it ignore such considerations and concentrate on rejecting the 'evidence' by pointing to hoaxes and misunderstandings, i.e., building on the psychological and psychosociological approach?\" Ultimately, the GEPAN hierachy chose a course of action \"that allowed scientists and technicians to take into account all the important elements, including the significant sociocultural dimension.\" Would that our own space officials were so enlightened! \"A scientific advisory body,\" continued Velasco, \"comprising astronomers, physicists, legal experts and other eminent personalities was set up to monitor and give direction to GEPAN activities. The first tasks undertaken included setting up a data collection system operated in conjunction with the Air Force, civil aviation authorities, weather services, the national police and the local Gendarmerie. Previously reported cases were investigated and statistical analyses conducted of eyewitness reports.\""},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"These initial efforts, according to Mr. Velasco, uncovered three characteristic facts: \"One, the appearance of certain unidentified phenomena cannot be accommodated by conventional physical, psychological or psycho-social models; Two, a physical component in the phenomena reported is extremely likely, and three, the spatial and temporal dimensions of the events are of a very low order.\" GEPAN developed two types of approaches, said Velasco. \"Mini- investigations, where the aim was to study significant cases from, say, a physical or psychosociological point of view, allowing a particular category of phenomena to be isolated. And full investigations, concerning unexplained cases and checking on all the observable elements, in particular the gathering and examination of physical and biological evidence.\" Since GEPAN's inception in 1979, Velasco noted that 19 such mini- and full investigations had been carried through. The most potentially productive of these, the Trans En Provence case (see the MUFON UFO Journal, March 1984, number 193) revealed evidence of a physical trace landing, \"including a 30 to 50% reduction in the chlorophyll pigments of wild alfalfa (medicago minima) in the vicinity of the reported landing, correlated to distance from the center of the phenomenon. \"Data show that a considerable amount of gamma radiation (10 rads) must be applied to produce a disturbance equivalent to that observed at the site. Should we consider the presence of ionizing (nuclear) radiation? Almost certainly not, since no measurable residual radioactivity was present in the plants. However, could the trauma be caused by an electromagnetic field? Probably.\" In conclusion, Velasco said \"the work of GEPAN has developed steadily and produced interesting results, but has also pointed to a set of fundamental limitations that arise from a certain inadequacy of the available data, from the analytical methods used, and from lack of knowledge. \"A major and essential step still remains to be taken, namely discovering the origin of — and interpreting — the different phenomena. This whole field of investigation and the associated body of hypotheses that need to be formulated fall beyond the scope of GEPAN. These questions are for the scientific, social and cultural community to tackle: such is the price of a more complete understanding (one day, we hope) of Unidentified Flying Objects.\" OCCUPANT CORRELATION Mr. Velasco was followed by Ret. Navy Captain Daniel Alberto Perisse, of Argentina. Now active in civilian South American ufological circles, Capt. Perisse first became interested in UFOs in 1965, while he was Commander of the Decepcion Island Navy Post in the South Shetland Archipelago, Anarctica. In the summer of that year, several research outposts on the island, including those of Argentina, Chile and England, were \"buzzed\" by UFOs on seven separate occasions. Experienced military and scientific personnel at all three bases were involved. In fact, both the Argentine Navy and Chilean Air Force subsequently issued official communiques on the sightings. As many as 14 individual observers were involved in one case in which the UFO was visible for an hour. Attempts to photograph the object were hampered by the slow speed (20 DIN) of the available film and fifty mile-an-hour winds (July is midwinter at the South Pole, when the bases are completely cut off from the outside world.) Still, the incidents were enough to convince Capt. Perisse that there was more to reports of UFOs than generally met public perception. In his own case, the sightings resulted in a lifelong involvement. \"But if the UFO phenomenon is truly strange,\" Perisse said in Washington, \"the existence of the occupant phenomenon is even more so.\" Like many of us, Perisse wondered if there might not be a way of validating the correlation between UFOs and reported occupants, given that our data is spotty and the subject reluctant to sit still for examination. Unlike some of us, he hit on a clever approach to the problem. What Perisse did was to take 12 cases from the files of UNICAT, the computerized UFO listing begun by the late Dr. Hynek and now maintained by Dr. Willy Smith. The criterion for selection was the inclusion of size estimates, both for the UFO and its reported occupants, and the number of the latter. Using that data, Perisse was able to obtain a coefficient rating of the \"contained\" (the UFO occupants) with the \"container\" (the UFO). Perisse admitted that such a statistical analysis was plagued by potential unknown factors, but that in general his findings fell within the expected parameters of humanlike technologies. \"This finding, bearing in mind that the UFO phenomenon is apparently intelligent, allows us to infer, finally, that the intelligence behind these appearances has conceived UFOs with the true capabilities of being occupied by the entities that have appeared inside them or nearby.\" Alternatively, a discrepancy in the correlation between UFOs and occupant volumes might have suggested that such reports had their origin in human fantasy, such as dreams and hallucinations. But before final conclusions can be drawn, Perisse advised, the number of such cases under study needs to be greatly enlarged. BRITISH UFOLOGY Bernard Shaw once described Britons and Americans \"as two peoples separated by a common language.\" Such is not quite the case today in regard to UFO research, though there have been dissimilarities, to be sure, in our respective experience. The most significant difference, according to veteran UFO writer Hilary Evans, a founder of the London-based ASSAP (the Association for the Scientific Study of Anomalous Phenomena), is Britain's lack of a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), which has resulted in the retrieval of thousands of UFO-related government documents in this country. The Ministry of Defense (MoD) in England has remained tight-lipped and close-fisted about UFOs under \"Iron Lady\" Margaret Thatcher and a prior succession of post-WW II prime ministers."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"\"The earliest, official involvement with the UFO phenomenon in Britain,\" said Evans, \"seems to have started in 1943, when a Lt. Gen. Massey is credited with heading an inquiry into the then current wave of 'foo-fighter' reports.\" The commission allegedly disbanded the following year. In the intervening forty-plus years,- the government has failed to mount another official investigation (at least publicly!). This means, of course, that UFO, research has fallen almost exclusively into the hands'of individual citizens, with the accompanying variations in quality that might be expected. The same is also true of press coverage of the subject, which ranges from the totally irresponsible and sensational reporting of most of the major daily .'• newspapers to more cautious and, resonable journalism on the grass-roots level. Well-known astronomer Patrick Moore (recently implicated in the Allingham hoax), Evans noted, is frequently trotted but to debunk the subject on TV and radio talk shows. \"But for more than forty years we have been fortunate enough to haye Flying Saucer Review, which in its heyday deserved its reputation as the world's leading UFO journal.\" However, many British researchers presently feel FSR is resting on its laurels, bounteous as they are. Various small UFO organizations dot the Isles, characterized both by serious investigation and (occasional) bickering. But in a rainstorm, they usually congregate under the umbrella of BUFORA, the British UFO Research Association, founded in 1959, and which now hosts a biennial UFO Congress, drawing speakers and investigators from America and the continent. \"The overall situation in Britain right now,\"Evansexplained, \"as no doubt elsewhere, is that fewer cases are being reported, but those few are of higher quality.\" He attributed that circumstance to a more educated public and a disenchantment with the authorities, government, military and scientific. (A potentially signficant discrepancy between UFO activity reported in the United States and England needs to be mentioned. According to Evans, \"though a few 6 K :• i^&X?S& HILARY EVANS such incidents have been reported here, American seems to have a near- monopoly of abduction cases.\" (BUFORA's director of investigations, Jenny Randies, presented a short Symposium paper on the same subject which we hope to reprint at a future date.) Current British research, said Evans, appears concentrated in three areas: an historical investigation of 1912-13 \"phantom-airship\" reports; a witness evaluation study employing a psychological questionnaire; and data collection and analysis centering on \"ball of light\" (BOL) phenomena, most probably natural in origin. The other present thrust of British ufology is towards increased international co- operation. ANCIENT UFOS Though Kenneth Arnold initiated the modern era of UFO reports in 1947, other countries and cultures can trace their UFO lineage back centuries, or in the case of India, even millenia, if its religious scriptures contain credible accounts of \"flying cars,\" or uimanas, as some believe. Reviewing ancient Sanskrit literature at the American University symposium this year was MUFON's representative for India, Mr. Kanishk Nathan of New Delhi. Tales of powerful flying machines flown by the pantheon of Hindu deities pepper the poetry found in Indian classics like the RigVedas. the Ramayana, and the Mahabharata, epic works for the most part only partially translated into English. In the case of the Rig-Vedas, the background oral tradition may date back as far as 10,000 B.C. Unfortunately, a few dubious UFO tracts have excerpted passages describing these ancient flying devices dud attached their own sensational interpretations to same. Such claims may, or more likely, may not represent humanity's first contact with extraterrestrial intelligence, suggested Mr. Nathan. However, there is one curious text worthy of serious consideration, the l/ymaam'Jca- Shaastra. or \"Science of Aeronautics.\" Unlike the other religous epics, the Vymaanika Shaastra recounts neither heroic nor allegorical deeds, but focuses almost exclusively on the uimanas, their technology and the psychological requirements, or"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"development, of their pilots. There is, said Nathan, a sort of matter-of- factness about the whole treatise that at least raises more questions than it answers. Unfortunately, Mr. Nathan was unable to attend to deliver his paper in person, due to a leg injury. CHILEAN OVNIS Unlike India, which is relatively bereft of modern UFO reports, Chile, according to journalist J. Antonio Huneeus, has logged virtually every category of sighting known to modern ufology, from radar-visual and landing cases, to scrambled jets, stalled motors, CE-3's and abductions. In fact, Huneeus' native Chile even enjoyed, if that's the word, a flying saucer flap in mid-1947, just as the U.S. was undergoing a similar \"scare.\" And likewise, sightings have continued down to the present day. The attitudes of officialdom have fairly closely paralleled America's, too, government and military officials occasionally issuing non-committal statements in the face of public pressure. Public ufology is mainly practiced in the press (and as here, the newspapers vary tremendously in quality and approach), through various civilian organizations, and via popular radio talk shows. With help from his extensive slide collection pertaining to Chilean and South American UFOs, Mr. Huneeus presented a thoroughly entertaining program. Space prohibits even a summary of the amount of material he covered, but his complete paper, along with those of the other invited international speakers, is printed in the MUFON Proceedings (International Symposium on Unidentified Aerial Phenomena: 1947-1987, Illus., 222pp., $15, plus $1.50 p&h, from MUFON, 103 Oldtowne Road, Seguin, TX, 78155.) MAJESTIC 12 William L. Moore, co-author with Charles Berlitz of The Roswell Incident, entertained a full banquet hall with an entrancing update of information concerning the apparent crash of a flying disc near Roswell, NM, and the subsequent recovery of four alien bodies. The most startling news came in the form of an anonymously supplied WILLIAM L. MOORE document Moore received dating from the late Forties which seemingly confirms the existence of a supersecret MJ, or Majestic, 12 group established to study UFOs and lAC's, or Identified Alien Craft. Moore, joined in his research by Stanton Friedman and LA TV producer Jamie Shandera, admitted the authenticity of the document in question has yet to be proven, but that persistent research in presidential and government files has not yet disproved it, either. The majority of those documents were published in the last issue of the Journal; a complete packet can be had for a nominal fee from the Fund For UFO Research. Among the more surprising MJ-12 revelations was the suggestion that the late Harvard astronomer, Dr. Donald H. Menzel, was a member of the elite organization. As many know, Menzel was probably the most ardent anti-UFO scientist and author on record. If it should turn out he was indeed a member of MJ-12, the history of early ufology in this country takes a sudden if not wholly unexpected turn, especially in terms of governmental disinformation. ABDUCTION PANELS Following Moore's banquet speech in the basement of the Mary Graydon Center, we marched back across the quad en masse to the Ward Circle Building for dessert, which was served up in the form of two panel discussions on the abduction phenomenon, one was composed of abductees, chaired by Dr. David Jacobs, the other of investigators, chaired by Dr. Michael Swords. Among the abductees were Whitely Strieber and \"Kathy Davis,\" who featured prominently in Budd Hopkins' Intruders. Space prohibits only the barest of impressions. For the most part, the abductees seemed surprisingly eloquent, given that they hailed from varied walks of life and were literally snatched off the street by the baffling nature of their experience. One could not but be impressed by their insistence that something strange had happened to them, though they themselves did not completely agree as to what it was. The women especially (the panel was equally divided between the sexes) expressed fear for their children, that they, too, might be abducted. AFRICAN FOLKLORE"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"WHITLEY STRIEBER Sunday morning, Cynthia Hind of Harare, Zimbabwe, MUFON's continental coordinator for Africa, who does yeoman's work investigating UFOs in her native country, said abductions seem to have passed South Africa by, though she did mention one case of reported \"missing time.\" Humanoids have been reported, often in association with landed objects, but here, as well as in \"standard\" UFO reports, the native interpretation of events is invariably colored by local folklore. One member of the Mashona tribe, who saw three beings in silver suits, told Cynthia \"They were the spirits of my ancestors.\" She replied that his ancestors probably wore animal hides and alligator teeth. \"Well,\" 8 he answered logically, \"times change!\" On the 29th of January, 1987, what was in all probability a balloon released by NASA crossed over the tip of the continent. At the same time, several workers at a saw mill reported an object containing two men, one dressed in blue and one in white. They remained convinced that the figures were Malawi ngangas (witch doctors) bound for South Africa for fresh muti, \"medicine.\" AUSTRALIA Similar native legends may inform the early history of UFOs in Australia, said Bill Chalker, MUFON state representative for New South Wales, though it is impossible to say with certainty at this late. remove. The Aborigines of western Australia revered \"a supreme being\" called Djamar. According to tradition, said Chalker, \"he manifested in a manner highly suggestive of 'something' landing and leaving behind a physical record. The young initiates of the tribe were led to the stony bed of a creek and were shown the holes where Djamar had planted his 'bullroarer.'\" The earliest modern Australian report on record of a UFO occurred the night of July 25-26, 1868, and is highly suggestive of the \"phantom airships\" reported in America almost 30 years later. A Fred. Wm. Birmingham said he saw a flying \"ark\" land in Parramatta Park, near Sydney. A \"spirit\" - \"the shape of a man in his usual frock dress\" - ostensibly the \"ark\" operator, took Birmingham aboard the \"machine\" and subsequently showed him \"papers\" which included formulae. \"The parallels with modern contact/abduction cases,\" said Chalker, \"are startling.\" Shortly after the turn of the century, in 1909, nearby New Zealand experienced a wave of phantom airship reports which trickled down into Australia to a lesser degree. Scattered reports occurred during the intervening years, but the modern UFO era down under began in 1950, with summer sightings from Geelong and Avoca, Victoria. Another \"invasion\" centered on the same state in 1954, followed by another flap in the fall of 1957. The famous Father Gill case of Papua New Guinea took place two years later. Another wave occurred in 1983. The most famous of all Australian UFO cases, of course, was undoubtedly the disappearance of young Frederich Valentich aboard a small Cessna over Bass Strait, the evening of October 21, 1978. Two months and ten days later, New Zealand was back in the picture again with the videotaped Kaikoura Lights. \"Clearly,\" Chalker concluded, \"even from this limited historical survey, it is apparent that Australia has a rich UFO tradition and a potent attendant controversy about its importance.\" UFO - SWEDEN From \"Down Under\" to the"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"Scandanavian countries is a long terrestrial hop.but apparently not where UFOs are concerned. The last 40 years, in Sweden, at least, have been characterized by the sorts of reports and the civilian and military response to them seen in other western countries, according to Bertil Kuhlemann, an engineer born in Gothenburg. In other words, Swedish ufology has had its ups and downs, in direct relation to the phenomenon and public interest. Recent Swedish activities have resulted in a co-investigation with UFO-Norway, employing sophisticated scientific and photographic equipment, of the persistent Hessdalen Lights, SSE of Trondheim. Other energetic efforts have been in the direction of the establishment of Project URD (UFO Reporting and Data System), a computerized data collection and analysis program, and the promotion of ICUR, the International Committee for UFO Research, of which Kuhlemann is a co-founder (1979) and present chairman. URUGUAY AND BRAZIL Dr. Willy Smith, who maintains his own UFO computer database, UNICAT, covered developments in both Uruguay and Brazil. Chauvinistic- ally, one might expect a \"backward\" or sensationalistic approach to UFOs in Uruguay, but this has not been the case, largely because of two factors, noted Smith. The first was the formation (in 1958) of the well regarded and scientifically incjined civilian UFO organization, CIOVI. Last year, CIOVI was appointed official adviser in UFO matters to the Division of Science and Technology of the Ministry of Education and Culture. Secondly, in 1979, the Uruguayan Air Force created its own commission for the study of UFO reports, CRIDOVNI. \"The history of the UFO phenomenon in Brazil,\" said Smith, \"is perhaps best divided into two periods: the classic, extending to the late 60's or early 70's, in which reports of UFO activity seem to indicate a systematic exploratory effort; and the modern period, typified by a predominance of CE3 and abduction reports, for the most part poorly investigated, and even ^jp^iisii r ^--'rt^* S?3?i3^isf .*at -*ttfi«K.Yfc?* fc£ v *«.* ** ^ ^ lagii*^^ 8 ^ jjgj gaifiaL^^ifBsatg^^^j?^ _ .\"«-^ r ^- . Phi/ip K/ass (i) with Larry Warren of Rendlesham Forest Fame more poorly documented.\" Which is not to say that all Brazilian reports should be thrown out with the bath water. Among those that have received wide publicity are the Barra da Tijuca photographs (1952), the Antonio Villas Boas abduction and sexual encounter (1957), the Trindade Island sequential photos (1958), and the Itaipu Fort incident on November 4, 1957. More recently, in May of 1986, the Brazilian Air Force engaged a group of nocturnal lights for three hours that seems to stand up as a solid case. Other modern reports, however, are frequently characterized by a profusion of abductions culminating in sexual encounters. \"The inference,\" Smith noted, \"is that Brazil has produced not only a myriad of sensational cases, alas, without scientific value, but also a handful of solid incidents which must be taken into account in any serious ufological research.\" CONCLUSIONS Much more could be said about what took place at the Washington Symposium, but even a summary of the other events would stretch available space. The barest bones will have to suffice. Of the more than twenty contributed papers presented in parallel sessions, we hope to publish the majority in future issues of the Journal. The media, print and electronic, needless to say, was out in full force. If there was an unfortunate aspect to the symposium, it was the fact that so many of \"us\" attended that the general public had to be turned away; there simply wasn't room to seat them. In terms of finances, Washington '87 may go down in history as the most successful UFO symposium yet, due to generous donations to alleviate travel expenses of the speakers. And since most of the money will go to replenish the coffers of the Fund for UFO Research, it couldn't have happened at a more opportune time to a more deserving group, since the same money will eventually be dispersed back into ufology via various research and investigative projects. Hopefully, the theme of the American University Symposium — \"40 Years Is Long Enough!\" — will filter through society at large in the same fashion. It's about time, too."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"THEORETICAL UFO PHYSICS By Daniel H. Harris, PH.D. Over the years, as studies of UFO phenomena have moved from data collection towards analysis and synthesis, scientists and other serious researchers have done increasingly sophisticated work with UFO data. Simultaneously, UFO investigating organizations have improved their data collection technology and investigative techniques. Both researchers and investi- gators have contributed to a marked improvement in the quality of UFO data and the credibility of UFO phenomena. But even with abundant high quality data, UFO research still lacks a theoretical structure, one that can interconnect patterns in the data and provide an understanding of underlying processes. A theoretical structure is essential if UFO research is to become a true scientific discipline. This discussion will introduce a first order theory of UFO physics, perhaps the first step towards a full theoretical structure for UFO science. . PATTERN SEARCH To find those phenomena which are credible, and thus useful in the physics analysis, it was necessary to look for patterns in thousands of UFO case reports. Most of the reports were found in case catalogs, in the more credible UFO books and in the newsletters of investigating organizations. (Thank you MUFON for providing quality case material for the pattern search.) Greater weight was given to physical trace cases, instrumented recordings, photo cases involving multiple witnesses, and other high quality data. The pattern search emphasized physical phenomena such as magnetic field effects, UFO propulsion capabilities, UFO light beams, UFO appearance changes, occupant capabilities, time rate effects like the 10 Rip van Winkle and inverse Rip van Winkle effects, weight changes near UFOs, etc. The nature of these phenomena is • such that they are probably not the product of intentional illusions produced by UFO intelligences. Therefore, I have studied the UFO case material assuming that all credible physical patterns are real phenomena. Case data patterns were accepted as credible only if several independent reports described similar phenomena, (Those cases involving hoaxes and witness errors were recognized by careful analysis and by comparison with the credible case data patterns.) The resulting set of credible patterns displays a striking uniformity, the same phenomena occurring repeatedly in reports from sources scattered widely in time and space. The coherent nature of these phenomena shows that we are generally dealing with competent witnesses and careful reporting. NEW PHYSICS The credible UFO phenomena include numerous examples of phenomena which suggest the existence of a new physics. For example, UFOs often move with very high accelerations, on the order of 300 g's. At other times they hover or levitate without substantial reaction thrust. They can fade to invisibility or they can change their apparent shape. Such physical effects invite investigation. As a starting point for this investigation I made the assumption (in December, 1972) that UFO physics is not too far beyond our current understanding. That is, the equations and principles of physics, when reconceptualized or extended, would give a first order understanding of UFO phenomena. (Otherwise effective UFO research would be beyond my ability and there would be no need for me to study the subject.) I also assumed that UFO phenomena are a single coherent set of phenomena describable by one truly comprehensive physics theory, not a variety of separate overlapping phenomena with diverse theories explaining each of them. After a year and a half of full time study I felt I had a very promising theory. Analysis has since shown that my success at that time was only because I had made a reasonable starting assumption. My initial assumption, slightly revised, has been the basis of all work done since: \"UFO physics may be understood if the presently recognized equations and principles of physics (Laws of Physics) are unchanged in peculiar regions, while certain physical constants act like field variables.\" Each physics model is specified by a set of equations describing relationships between newly recognized variables, variables which in conventional physics are considered invariant physical constants. To formulate a physics model one seeks a set of relationships among these new variables which satisfies the principles and equations of physics and which also provides an understanding of UFO phenomenona. (Some of these newly recognized variables are: the speed of light, the time rate, certain atomic constants, and the particle and field energies.) Preserving the standard equations of physics in a peculiar region while permitting some constants to vary has the important consequence that only those physics models which satisfy Einstein's principle of relativity have self-consistent variations of the new variables. Therefore, I assume that Einstein's principle of relativity is valid in regions with peculiar conditions. I call this assumption the Principle of Relativity II. This means that an"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"observer inside a peculiar region when doing observations restricted to that region would not be able to find anything peculiar about the local physics. LIGHT SPEED Early in this work I tested a variety of UFO physics models. All the early models, including my own, failed by varying degrees when they were tested for physical plausibility, self- consistency and agreement with the full set of credible UFO phenomena. The most promising models were Relativity II models. However, even the Relativity II models gave an understanding of only a subset of UFO phenomena. Still, the early studies did produce results which are simple enough to be independent of the model chosen. Primary among these is the evident variation of the speed of light near UFOs. The bending of light beams near UFOs, the apparent UFO shape and size changes, their ability to merge or fission, their frequently diffuse edges, and other effects argue for real light speed variations near UFOs. Light speed variations make these exotic phenomena understandable as consequences of light bending. The light speed variation concept was one of the keys to formulating the physics models. Since 1980, the speed of light has been treated as the root variable in all the Relativity II physics models. That is, each of the physics models has specified relations between the speed of light and the other new variables. Because UFO phenomena are so exotic and diverse, testing physics models takes considerable effort, particularly since interpretation is quite uncertain even when using the best data. After many attempts at finding a comprehensive physics model, it became clear th..i if emphasis remained primarily on analysis of UFO case data, then no physics model would be established as uniquely superior. Inconsistencies and other flaws in the physics tended to remain unnoticed when the focus was on explaining the case data. Additional input data was needed, such as a simplifying principle from physics or some critical observation from another area of science. Searches for critical test phenomena in ball lightning physics and in observations of peculiar astronomical objects did not at that time yield useful results. In the fall of 1984, my research shifted toward finding elegance, simplicity and self-consistency in the physics models. At that time the full utility of the principle of Relativity II became apparent, as well as the critical importance of the principle of energy conservation. (In Relativity II the principle of energy conservation tells us that an observer inside a peculiar region upon measuring and comparing various kinds of energy finds all forms of energy as expected from normal physics, while an outside observer measuring these same inside energy values finds all forms of energy scaled by a factor related to the peculiar region's speed of light. This is analogous to the shrinking of objects and the slowing of clocks in Einstein's relativity.) In late 1986, by using the principle of Relativity II and the principle of energy conservation, I discovered a set of physics models which are both elegant and self-consistent. These models are simpler in concept than earlier models and they describe more UFO phenomena than previously understood. Furthermore, these models give a better understanding of observations of ball lightning and exotic astronomical objects like quasars. Each of these models postulates that in a peculiar region all forms of energy vary together and are proportional to a power of the speed of light, e.g., one model says that all forms of energy vary with the speed of light squared. PHYSICAL CHANGES Between October, 1986, and January, 1987, I tested these models against patterns in the UFO case data. It seems that only one of these models fits the widest range of patterns in the UFO data. Furthermore, this same physics model requires the least modification to conventional physics. Therefore, I believe that this particular physics model is the key to understanding UFO physics. Results presently available show that this model gives an understanding of UFO invisibility and appearance changes, extreme UFO maneuvers and levitation, UFO invisibility and levitation, UFO associated time loss and time advancement, UFO generated high strength magnetic fields, UFO light beams and light beam bending near UFOs, UFO light beam weapons, access to parallel space times, faster than light travel, and many other phenomena. It is very pleasing to find that one comprehensive theory does indeed explain the UFO phenomena. Although this theory provides a useful tool for understanding relationships among the new variables, it does not as yet provide an understanding of the process which generates or triggers the peculiar physics effects. This source process is the process which connects unusual conditions in the peculiar region with changes in the speed of light and other physical constants. Since peculiar physics effects seem to occur spontaneously and naturally in ball lightning, quasars, and other exotic astronomical objects, I believe that with the aid of the present theory and greater knowledge of the conditions in these peculiar objects we may be able to pin down the source process. We should then be able to build devices to replicate these peculiar effects. We may even build UFO-like vehicles and then follow UFOs to find out their point of origin and purpose here.

Hundreds, and probably thousands, of astonished people looked up in the sky and saw something they'd never seen before. . It was huge, awesome and spectacular. It was seen not once but many times over a period of more than three years. No one knew what it was. No one yet knows. . . These are the opening words of the prologue of Night Siege: The Hudson Valley UFO Sightings, to be published by Ballantine Books in October. This is a book about what was probably the most spectacular, prolonged series of sightings anywhere in the world. The sightings began, as far as we can learn, as midnight approached on New Year's Eve 1982 and have continued until as recently as the latter part of May 1987, with 1983 and 1984 being the periods of the most frequent sightings by large numbers of people. Thousands of people saw what most described as a huge, boomerang- shaped object, usually very brightly lit and moving low and very slowly in the night sky. Often, it simply hovered silently or emitted only a faint humming sound. FLYING CITY One man called it a \"flying city.\" Another said it was a big as an aircraft carrier. Nearly all said it was as large as a football field, and some said three football fields. Although the sightings began on New Year's Eve 1982, it was several months before we first became aware of them, and life has not been the same since. Virtually all of our spare time since then has been spent investigating 12 PHILIP IMBROGNO in an area of more than 1,400 square miles. Although sightings were reported as far north as Albany, New York, and well into Massachusetts, we restricted our investigation to Westchester, Putnam and Dutchess counties in New York, and Fairfield, Litchfield and New Haven counties in Connecticut. We estimate at least 5,000 people saw the UFO, and we have several thousand hours of taped interviews with hundreds of witnesses, many of them good, solid people with professional backgrounds. Even then, we had to ignore literally hundreds of reports, simply because we didn't have the time or manpower — or money — to run down every one. At first I had no thought of writing a book about the sightings. My first concern was to investigate the reports and document them as fully as possible. BEGINNINGS In March 1983, The New York Times wanted to run a story on the sightings and a reporter phoned Allen Hynek at his home in Arizona. When the reporter said hundreds of people had seen a UFO the size of a football field over a major highway, Allen was astounded. He hadn't heard about the sightings. Allen phoned me and asked what, was going on. We had just gotten started on our investigation and I hadn't had time to notify anyone else. I filled him in on what we had learned so far, and shortly afterwards he flew to Connecticut to work with our investigation team. From the first moment I learned about the sightings, I knew it was going to be more than one man could handle, and we soon formed a team that included Sheila Sabo, George Lesnick, Fred Dennis and Chris Clark. Allen joined me in supervising the investigation. In all, Allen came to Connecticut six times to work with us, and it was around the end of 1983 that he asked if I had thought about putting together a book on the sightings. I told him no. He thought this was such a good case that . a book should be written, and said that if I decided I wanted to, to contact him because he'd like to write it with me. Allen was impressed by the numbers and backgrounds of people who reported seeing the UFO (as were the rest of our investigation team). Allan was convinced that this case had no logical explanation. The investigation continued well into 1985 with no end to the sightings. By then we had hundreds of hours of taped interviews and six notebooks filled with data. It was at that time that I put much of the information into a computer and we came up with the estimate that at least 5,000 had seen the UFO since the beginning of 1983. This was based not only on all the reports we had received but also on those made to police"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"stations, airports, newspapers, radio and TV stations and to a UFO hotline phone that investigator Peter Gersten had set up in Westchester County. What was particularly impressive was the type of. people who were willing to go on record as having seen this thing: scientists, engineers, doctors, lawyers, pilots, corporate executives, professors, police officers and people from all walks of life. Allen and I tried to put a manuscript together at that time, but it was almost impossible. Hundreds of taped interviews still had to be transcribed, and this was a gigantic task that Sheila Sabo took on. For months, Sheila typed and produced hundreds of pages of transcripts that became the raw material we would work with. Allen and I worked up an outline and began selecting material for the various chapters. However, Allen's health was poor by then and I was too busy with the investigations. We were dealing with a vast amount of material and realized we needed a professional writer. BOB PRATT We made an agreement with one writer to do the book, but he later backed out, saying he had another project he wanted to finish. It was then that our agent, John White, suggested we ask one of his clients, Bob Pratt, to write the book. Bob had become interested in the UFO phenomenon as a tabloid reporter in 1975 and since 1981 had been an independent investigator working on his own, mostly in Brazil. He had interviewed 1,300 to 1,400 people in North and South America and the Far East about their sightings and encounters, and had written extensively about UFOs. Allen had known Bob since 1975 and respected him, both as a reporter and investigator. I didn't know Bob at the time, but Allen thought he'd be a good choice and that was good enough for me. John phoned Bob, who had given up hope of ever taking a firsthand look at the Hudson Valley case, and he immediately accepted. That was early in 1986.1 sent Bob the outline plus material for the first two chapters. In less than two weeks, he Taconlc State Parkway (W7-W11-W15-W21 & 26) sent back a polished book proposal and the first two chapters, and we were in Dusiness. Several months later Ballantine bought rights to the book and throughout 1986 Bob and I worked together closely. He made two trips to the Hudson Valley to take a personal look at the sighting areas, but for the most part we worked through the mails and by phone. Sadly, Allen died in April 1986, just several weeks before Ballantine agreed to publish our book. Shortly after, his wife, Mimi, accepted our invitation to work with us, critiquing the manuscript as it was written. She offered many excellent suggestions and was very helpful in shaping the final book. We believe Allen would have liked the book. It's a serious, nuts and bolts type of book without any mystical or metaphysical aspects to it. For the most part, it simply relates many of the more vivid sightings, but does touch on the possibility that a few witnesses may have had more than just an ordinary encounter. We make no claims as to what the UFO was, what it was doing or where it came from. We simply present a strong case for the existence of something that has not yet been explained, and we appeal to the world's scientific community to stop ignoring the evidence. As we said at the end: We do not know what it is. We can only speculate. We would like to know what it is, and we believe everyone who saw it would like to know. We invite the scientists of the world to take an openminded, objective look at this phenomenon and help solve the mystery. (Night Siege: The Hudson Valley UFO Sightings, by Dr. J. Allen Hynek and Philip J. Imbrogno with Bob Pratt, is to be published in soft cover by Ballantine Books in October 1987.) 13"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"LETTER FROM BRAZIL By Bob Pratt ® 1987 by Bob Pratt I spent most of the month of September 1986 in Brazil. It was a successful trip in that I got to do most of the things I wanted to do, but it was tiring and frustrating in many ways. The people I worked with, however, were absolutely magnificent, very generous of their time and hospitality and even money. Jean Alencar, a lawyer in Fortaleza; even took a whole week off from his practice to take me to various places in his home state, Ceara, and shared many of his cases with me. Although I went to only a relatively few areas in Brazil, it was enough to show me that virtually all the things that were going on back in 1977 and 1978 (which took me to that country on the first of half a dozen visits) are still going on, and.have been virtually non-stop through the years. People in the interior are still being terrified by UFOs. They're still being panicked by the sudden appearance of a brilliantly lighted object just over their heads as they walk in country areas at night. And, as they run in fright, they are still being \"chased,\" if that is the proper word. Maybe they're simply being \"followed\" out of curiosity or for some other reason, although in at least one case there was a prolonged, deliberate attempt to get at a witness- victim in his hiding place. Some people are still being injured (usually the mild-burn type of thing). Some are definitely being persecuted in the sense that a UFO will persist over a period of time in trying to do something (what?) to them. And I believe several more deaths can be attributed to the UFOs, although the deaths may have been an unfortunate \"byproduct\" of the encounters. Perhaps most fascinating of all is that virtually the same things that happened in the 1977 \"Crab Island case\" near Sao Luis (in which one man 14 . J^V\" 1 \" \"*• p \"*'»,t-*\"\"-''~- i \"-*r ' : :>--'-*- *•- x^£~ xj*-**\"^^,\" ^- - ^ r *-r T \" --'i.-- --:••\" ; '• ^j^^;^^>-*;^_v-^^^ ; v.^ ,-s+ •&#•*•' -. .-• ^Wv-ii.-^ 1^^;^ Artist Dudley Guy's interpretation of a UFO. died and two were badly burned) have occurred again, in the same place and under almost identical circumstances nine years and one week later. This time one man died and a second was injured somehow and two others became ill and fell unconscious for at least 15 hours. Again, there is no explanation. It is possible that neither Crab Island case is a genuine UFO case, because the link to UFOs in the first case was tenuous at best and in the second there appears to be nothing whatsoever tying it to a UFO. But in both cases something truly inexplicable happened and if a UFO wasn't responsible, then some equally baffling phenomenon is at work. (More on this later.) CASES CONTINUE Briefly this is what I learned from the trip: 1.) In Rio, Irene Granchi brought me up to date on 27 sightings that had occurred in different parts of Brazil between March 19 and June 15. These included the Brazilian Air Force (FAB) jet chase on the night of May 19. Also included was a sighting at 3:30 A.M. May 18 in the Jardim Botanico district of Rio by a woman psychologist currently living in New York. She told Irene she had watched a group of seven to ten small objects and one large object moving from north to south and take up five different formations over a 15- minute period. Irene also told me about a case that occurred on the night of May 23-24 in Rondonopolis involving a man named Edivaldo who was driving in a truck when he saw a lighted object off to one side of the road. He then saw a flash of light and was unconscious for 72 hours. He has no recollection of what happened to him. Irene hopes to have a psychologist in Sao Paulo hypnotize the"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"man. Irene had another case involving five persons who had close encounters on two consecutive nights (while fishing at a beach south of Rio) with an object the size of a two-story house coming down and hovering within 30 meters of them. On the second night, they saw a plane apparently chasing the UFO and one of the witnesses, an Air Force veteran, said it was an FAB jet. 2.) In Rio I also talked with Cynthia Luce, one of three MUFON representatives for Brazil. I had a chance to see interviews with the witnesses because Mauro Costa, a philosophy professor from Rio, had gone with her to re-interview the witnesses and he videotaped the interviews. I found the use of a video camera quite interesting, and I can see great possibilities for it (plus a number of disadvantages). 3.) Since May, UFO sightings and encounters have been occurring in and around a small village named Conceicao do Mato Dentro in Minas Gerais. This is in the Valley of the River of the Old Women, which is four or five hours' drive north of Belo Horizonte and is where Hulvio Aleixo (in my estimation one of the world's best, most thorough researchers) has been investigating cases for the past 35 years or so. I was in Belo Horizonte September 9, 10 and 11, and the most recent sighting in the Valley had been on September 2. This information came from Albert Eduardo, a young man about 30 who is a member of AMPEU in Belo Horizonte and is one of the editors of Jornal UFO-LOGICO. Hulvio has also investigated some of the same sightings and he gave me a number of details. Just a few days before I met with Albert Eduardo, he had gone to Conceico do Mato Dentro with another young man and they videotaped their interviews. I saw the tape, with Alberto Do Carmo (a physics teacher and veteran investigator) interpreting for me. Among the cases: (a) A shy 18-year-old was returning to his home on the night of September 2 when a big reddish light suddenly turned on above his head. It frightened him and he ran and hid under a tree, injuring his arm as he scrambled for a hiding place. (b) A middle-aged man returning to his home was riding a donkey and leading another that was loaded with goods of some kind. An enormous light appeared as he neared his mother's house and \"chased\" him. The light then turned off and he didn't see it any more. He was temporarily blinded. His cargo mule ran off and the other refused to walk. The man described the object as a \"flying refrigerator\" with four red and yellow spots on it and said it made a buzzing sound. (c) On the same night, a young man who used to mock people who said they saw flying saucers was himself chased by a UFO and had his \"clothes torn off.\" He said the UFO \"abused\" him, but I don't know the details of this case. Now the young man will not walk at night alone any more. (d) A woman and two small boys walking in the dark saw a UFO come over the top of a hill and they hid under a tree. The UFO approached the tree and they ran on to a grove of bamboo trees, crawling in on their hands and knees to hide. A woman living nearby saw all this happen from her house (she could see the people running because they were illuminated by an electric light in the street). She said the UFO flew very low, was silent and looked like a \"fire torch.\" This woman said: \"Everybody runs away from the light. Everybody's afraid of it.\" She also said a peasant claimed to have seen a UFO land on a field behind his house; he felt heat, got scared and locked the door. She also said the UFO was being seen almost every night. (e) On the night of May 15,1986, a 70-year-old farm worker named Joaquim watched as a UFO hovered about 50 paces away from his house, maybe 10 to 15 meters above the ground, for a half hour. He said it was flashing a beam of light all around the hills and occasionally shined it on him. He was standing in a doorway, with the lower half of the door closed, looking at it. He shielded his face with his left arm, holding it up to cover his eyes. But on one occasion his right eye was exposed, and he lost about 80 percent of the vision in that eye and his left arm was burned (like a sunburn). He said he heard voices, but couldn't understand the language. When the UFO finally lifted off and went away, it hit some electricity lines, breaking one of them. Repairmen for the power company came out some days later to fix the wire and one of the repairmen reportedly saw an unusual light in the distance. Many people began carrying guns and one such man, 22, said he saw a UFO shaped like a \"refrigerator\" land one night about 20 meters away from him. He said an occupant descended on a stairway. The witness was carrying a .38 revolver and he fired twice. Apparently he didn't hit the object nor did he hear any ricocheting sound. He became frightened and ran home. MANEUVERS In Belo Horizonte, Alberto do Carmo told me that Albert Eduardo had talked to policewoman and a pilot who were among a number of people who saw about a dozen objects flying figure eights and in triangular and square patterns near the airport at Monte Claros in north-central Minas Gerais in May. The objects appeared to be in an intelligent formation and one looked bigger than the others. Some of the smaller ones were seen entering bigger ones. All this lasted for about two hours. I did not get a chance to talk to Albert Eduardo about this. (A similar sighting was described to me by two night watchmen in a suburb of Mendoza, Argentina, in 1978; they said that before dawn one day in July of that year, a large number of small objects — one witness said 25 to 30, the other said hundreds — were flying figure-eights in and out among the light pylons of Mendoza's new soccer stadium.) I went on to Fortaleza, and Jean Alencar took me to Paraipaba, a small city near the coast west of Fortaleza, where we stayed overnight in a peasant's house on a farm (quite an experience: Manuel and Adelaide, our hosts, were poor but kind and generous with what they had. Manuel, Jean, another guy and I walked to the beach, four miles away, almost all of it over huge sand dunes. It was like trekking in the desert, but before reaching the dunes we had to walk 60 to 70 yards through an ankle-deep swampy area. Fortunately for me, someone loaned me a pair of rubber-soled sandals). 15"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"In Paraipaba and the area of Adelaide's farm, we talked to nearly a dozen, people who had had UFO sightings or encounters as long ago as ten. years before and as recently as 7 o'clock the night before, the latter just a few miles from where we were staying. In one incident, a man and his grown son had a close encounter that left them both feeling burned and suffering from headaches. On the third day, Jean and I then went to another small coastal village called Pecem, where there were several serious cases: One involved a farm worker, now 52, who had gone fishing one night in 1983 at a place on the beach where he had fished for 30 years. At 2 A.M. a bright light suddenly appeared over his head and he ran and hid under the nearest tree. For the next four hours, he said, the UFO stayed above him and and every few minutes shined a beam of light down on him and his hiding place. He was terrified and every time the light went off he felt frigid cold. When dawn broke, the UFO disappeared and the man ran home. He hid under a bed at first and was sick and nauseated for weeks. Ever since then he has refused to go out at night and will not stay home by himself. He no longer fishes and his family says he now has \"mental problems.\" We then talked to two women, one 34 and the other 28. Four years ago, they and a third woman (a sister of the 28-year-old) and two children had been gathering wood in the sand dunes near the beach a short distance east of Pecem. This was at dusk, and suddenly a big orange light appeared above their heads and they ran. The wood they were carrying slowed them down so they threw it away. They ran 500 meters before reaching some trees where they could hide, and the UFO chased them or followed them all the way and then passed on out of sight. All of them were sick and nauseated and had headaches for more than a week, and nine days after the incident, the 34-year-old woman, who was then seven months pregnant, gave premature birth. I saw her baby, Kelvia, who is now 4 years old and is a sweet, good-natured child. She smiles a lot and chatters a bit, but she doesn't walk and 16 • she has heart problems. The third woman, who was two months pregnant, aborted and lost, her baby. You could argue that any pregnant woman who runs 500 meters risks losing her baby regardless of the circumstances, but if the UFO had not appeared, these women would never have run. So, in that sense, the death, and perhaps the premature birth of a child who may never walk, can be blamed on a UFO. LIGHT BEAM On my fourth day in Fortaleza, Jean, another investigator named Reginaldo Athayde, who owns a pharmacy, and I went to Quixada (a two-hour drive south of Fortaleza), where we first interviewed Antonio Moreira Megalhes, a physician who, 10 years earlier, had treated Luis Fernandes Barros, then 52, a well-to-do Quixada businessman and ranch owner, after Barros had a UFO encounter. At about 7 A.M. on the morning of April 23, 1976, a vaquero found Barros dazed and sitting in a.two- wheel carriage .behind a donkey, several kilometers from his ranch (16 kms from Quixada). When Barros became coherent, he said that about two hours before daybreak a big lighted object came down and hovered just above him and the donkey. A door of some kind opened on the bottom and a beam of light was projected down on him and the donkey. He didn't know what happened after that. Barros complained of being very sick, suffering from nausea, diarrhea, headaches and vomiting. (The donkey appeared to be in a sort of stupor for about a week, but then recovered.) Barros' wife, Teresina, took him to Quixada to see Dr. Megalhes, who was then 40 and had known Barros nearly all his life. The doctor listened to Barros' story and gave him medicine to alleviate his sick feeling. However, the medicine didn't help, and the doctor sent Barros to Fortaleza to see a psychiatrist. Teresina (most of these details came from her and the rest from Dr. Megalhes) told us she had her husband in Fortaleza for two months and he was seen by 12 psychiatrists and psychologists, and the only conclusion they came to was that he had a brain lesion. He was sent home. In the meantime, Barros had stopped telling his story about the UFO because almost no one believed him, other than his wife and Dr. Megalhes (who was ridiculed by his fellow physicians for believing the story). Further, Barros' speech began to deteriorate and three months after the incident his hair turned white. By the end of six months, he had lost all of his mental faculties and had regressed to the age of a one or two-year-old child. And ever since, the only words he says are \"Mamae,\" \"Medo\" and \"Da,\" (which I think mean Mama, danger and give). He recognizes only his wife and needs a fulltime nurse to take care of him. He reacts to no stimuli, except that when someone takes a picture of him with a strobe light, he screams when he sees the flash. We went to see Barros, who lives in a large, well furnished and expensive home in Quixada and he simply sits staring, occasionally moving his eyes but apparently seeing nothing. Dr. Megalhes, who seems to be a very sensible, intelligent man, showed us that Barros has control of his arms and legs and did.not suffer a stroke. This is one of Reginaldo's cases. Apparently there have been many UFO happenings in the Quixada area, and some residents refer to the city as the \"UFO capital of the northeast.\" We had lunch and after leaving the restaurant we ran into a radio announcer friend of Reginaldo's who said he had seen a UFO on the airfield at Quixada in 1985. We had intended to see him in the afternoon to get the details but we ran out of time and didn't get back to see him. In the afternoon, we attempted to check out a report published in the Rio newspaper O Dia several years ago that the village of Jaburu, near Quixada, was being terrorized by UFOs. We drove off in search of Jaburu but never got there. Some distance east of Quixada, we turned off the paved highway onto a one-lane dirt road and followed that for at least 17 kms before giving up because the road became impassable. We stopped from time to time to get directions (Jaburu was"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"always just \"three or four kilometers\" farther down the road) and usually heard some reference to strange lights being seen in the area. Near the end of our search, we stopped at a peasant's small mud-and-thatch house for directions, and we heard two separate reports of sightings. The father had seen something flying by one night, and on another night two of his teenage sons said they had been \"chased\" across a field by a bright light. UFO DEATHS? The following day, Jean and a young friend of his, \"Junho,\" and I drove 400 miles to Teresina, where we contacted four young members of a UFO organization. They knew absolutely nothing about the Parnarama case in which four hunters allegedly were killed by UFOs in October 1981. Parnarama is only 80 kms south south of Teresina. (These deaths were reported in several Brazilian magazines and the National Enquirer, in the latter part of 1981, and the case was one of the principal reasons why I went to Brazil, to check out these reports. Reports of deaths in UFO cases always bother me — it is the ultimate in UFO experiences, I would say — and I cannot understand why someone doesn't do whatever is necessary to determine how true they are. In theEnquirer's case, they relied on a stringer in Rio who relied on a reporter from Sao Luis who may or may not have gone to Parnarama to investigate.) However, the young men, from Teresina agreed to take a day off from their jobs and go with us to Parnarama the next day. Originally, Jean, Junho and I had planned to spend at least two days in the Parnarama area, but shortly after we arrived in Teresina, Jean phoned home and learned he had to return almost immediately because of a court case, so we were able to spend only several hours in Parnarama the next day. The next morning, we drove to Parnarama, a really dirty, dusty drive that ended with a five-minute ferryboat ride across the Parnaiba, a shallow, muddy river several hundred yards wide at that spot. We went straight to City Hall, since the police chief and mayor had been quoted in the stories. Naturally, by then there was a new chief and a new mayor, and at first no one knew anything about the four hunters. But suddenly we began to get swamped with people who had seen or encountered UFOs, and one of them did confirm that at least one of the four hunters had died. This man said the hunter and a companion saw a UFO one night in October 1981 and the companion ran and hid, and when he returned he found the other man dead. No one we talked to knew anything about any other hunters dying as the result of UFO encounters, but the areas mentioned in the news stories were some distance from Parnarama. What we did learn is that UFO sightings are fairly common in the Parnarama area (before we were able to leave, we made a courtesy call on the mayor, a capable, confident looking man in his mid-thirties who told us there were \"at least 100 UFO cases\" in the Parnarama area) and there had been sightings as recently as 10 and 20 days before we went there (September 18). In one case, a landowner said he tried to shoot at a UFO one night and received what felt like an electric shock. In another case, a city councilwoman who was fishing in a lake with a companion one night said a UFO came down and hovered over one end of the lake. She said the light was so bright she could see the fish swimming around in the lake. Some day I want to go back and spend a week or more in that area. As it is, the brief visit was an eye-opener to the young men who had gone down there with us from Teresina (when we first talked to them, they had only one possible UFO case 20 or 30 kms north of Teresina to work on), and I am sure they will be returning there. There have been enough sightings in the Parnarama area alone to keep them busy for at least a year. We were able to confirm at least one of the deaths reported in the Enquirer, but information on the other three will have to wait until the young men from Teresina can spend much more time in the area. CRAB ISLAND Jean and Junho drove back to Fortaleza and I went to Sao Luis — by bus. I had a 21-day air pass on VASP, one of the four major domestic airlines, but V ASP's flight attendants went on strike several days after I arrived in Fortaleza, overloading the other airlines and making it impossible to get a flight. In Sao Luis, my friends, Monica Carneiro and Ana Teresa Britto (Monica teaches English in both a university and a private school and Ana teaches in the private school), helped me track down the story of the latest Crab Island mystery (they were my principal interpreters on the original Crab Island case in 1978; now they help me because we're good friends). As you may remember, in 1977 on the night of April 25-26, four men (who had sailed a 40-foot wooden boat to Crab Island to get wood) intended to awaken about midnight (when the tide came in), load the wood (which had been cut and stacked on the river bank next to the boat) and sail back to Sao Luis on the outgoing tide. Three of the men had done this a hundred times before, relying on their own inner clocks and the rising tide's rocking the boat to awaken them. However, on this night, they didn't wake up until about 6 the next morning. By then, one man, a 22-year-old, was dead in his hammock and his older brother, Firmino, was badly burned and his cousin, Auleriano, was also burned but less severely. (I spent a month in Sao Luis on this case; police said there was no evidence of a fire on the boat — a fact that I confirmed with a personal visit afer wading barefoot 75 yards through knee- deep swamp — or on the banks of the river on Crab Island.) Only Apolinario, another brother, was apparently unharmed, and he had to sail the boat back to Sao Luis by himself. Firmino was left crippled by his burns and he is no longer able to work. The men could not remember what happened, not even when they were put under hypnosis by Dr. Silvio Lago, a Niteroi physician and former medical professor who had used hypnosis in his practice for 45 years. The police were not able to determine what happened, although they were convinced the three survivors were telling the truth. This occurred during a period of 17"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"extremely heavy UFO activity in the general area stretching from Sao Luis on the east to Pinheiro, a two-hour ferryboat ride and 70-km drive to the west. (The mayor of Pinheiro told me in 1978 and again in 1981 that a UFO appeared over Pinheiro — sometimes hovering and then shooting right out into the atmosphere, and sometimes corning right back down to 1,000 meters above the town — almost every night for four months in 1977 and that probably 50,000 people in his region alone had seen it.) Crab Island is in Sao Marcos Bay between Sao Luis and Pinheiro. All this, plus the fact that a doctor who was skeptical of all UFO reports said he heard Firmino (at the time in a hospital in a semi-coma) mumble something about seeing a light or fire (\"o fogo,\" a common term at that time for a UFO), are the only reasons for suspecting a UFO might have been involved. Now then, earlier last year, four men in a similar boat also went to Crab Island for the same purpose. They sailed three on April 28, spent two days cutting more than 300 pieces of wood (actually, poles three to four meters long) and had stacked them on the river bank next to their boat. On April 30, they quit working about 6 P.M. (at dusk) and at aobut 8 one of the men, Juvencio, 22, began to cook their supper. However, he complained about feeling dizzy and he fell to the deck unconscious. Another man, Anselmo, and a third, Lazaro, 44, also began to feel dizzy and they too fainted. None of these three know what happened to the fourth man, Verissimo, 21, but when Lazaro (the first to awaken) regained consciousness at noon the next day, Verissimo was dead,, with no marks on him, although some blood was trickling from his mouth. The other two revived shortly after, but all three were sick and nauseated. Juvencio also had a head injury of some kind, with the right side of his head being swollen. The two uninjured men tried to load the wood onto the boat, but quit after getting less than 30 pieces on board and, with difficulty, sailed the boat back to Sao Luis. The port authorities investigated and cannot determine what happened. Monica, Ana and I were able to locate 18 only Juvencio, because Lazaro was somewhere near Alcantara, across Sao Marcos Bay, and Anselmo had gone into the interior and no one knew exactly where he was. From what Juvencio and the port authorities told us, none of the survivors know what happened to them. They are certain that food poisoning was not to blame, and the authorities do not believe any kind of poisonous gas could have been the cause. No autopsy was performed on Verissimo; by the time the boat reached Sao Luis, his body was badly decomposed (just as in the first Crab Island case; the doctor in that case listed \"emotional shock\" as the cause of death). . Verissimo's death certificate (which the port authorities let us see) simply says the cause of death was \"undetermined.\" The only thing unusual that happened that night is that, sometime between 6 and 8 P.M., the men heard a loud crashing sound somewhere nearby in the darkness, as if a large tree had fallen over. However, they have never known of a tree falling over on Crab Island. Juvencio and Lazaro refuse to go aboard a boat any more, we were told, and the port authorities (who have a role similar to our Coast Guard) have forbidden anyone to go to Crab Island to gather wood any more. This supposedly had been prohibited all along, but never was enforced, and after this second incident the authorities notified all boat owners in the port that the law would be strictly enforced henceforth. One other weird coincidence: Both Juvencio and the young man who died, Verissimo (Juvencio's brother-in- law), were related by blood or marriage to all four of the men who were involved in the first Crab Island incident. There is no obvious UFO connection in this case, only the unexplained crashing sound. A neighbor of Juvencio's, one of many people who gathered around as we interviewed Juvencio, told us that one night in 1983 he had been on a boat in a stream between Alcantara and Itauna, which are across Sao Marcos Bay from Sao Luis and not too far from Crab Island, and a big bright light came down, hovered over them and shined a beam of light on the boat. He and his companions dived overboard and hid in bushes along the bank. He said people in several other boats in the area had similar experiences that year. So, this is a summary of most of the cases I looked into or heard about in Brazil. I actually did little real investigation on this trip since I didn't have much time. Mostly I talked to witnesses, often in the presence of neighbors who listened to the interviews without any negative remarks. Taken in the context of all the other cases I have investigated or looked into to some extent in Brazil over the past eight years, I found most of the stories quite believable. A common thread seems to run through most of them, and often the experience is a rather traumatic one for the witness. I find it difficult to understand how such things can go on year after, year without the authorities learning about them or, if they do, ever trying to do something about them. What does it take to get them or the scientists interested in this phenomenon?

The disc crossed their path at .about 1000 feet and they turned to give chase. The aircraft was flying at 170 mph, but the disc flew out of sight in four minutes. * * * THIRTY-FIVE YEARS AGO - August 1952: Scripps-Howard Staff Writer, Doyle Kline, observed a flight of ten luminous discs pass over Albuquerque, New Mexico, at 9:50 p.m. on the second. Their flight was soundless. They were clustered together, then they shifted to a perfect V-formation. Within seconds they formed two rows with the discs spaced by exact intervals. The shift was done with precision, incredibly swift, and fantastically violent. At 4:30 a.m. the following day, a Hamilton Air Force Base (California) pilot observed eight flying discs over the Farallon Islands, west of San Francisco. Base officials confirmed that at the same time coast radar installations tracked UFOs in the same area \"intermittently,\" and that three intercept missions with F-86 jets were dispatched to investigate but sighted nothing. Li. B.A. Swinley, the, pilot who observed the discs, said' they were round, silver, \"were definitely physical objects,\" and flew in an irregular diamond-shaped formation and then shifted to string out one behind the other. He estimated their speed at 400 mph. On the morning of the 20th, the radar crew at the Air Defense Command Post near Congaree Air Force Base, near Columbia, South Carolina, observed an unidentified object move across their scope at a speed in excess of 4000 mph. On the following day, a Jet pilot from O'Hare Field, Chicago, made four passes at a UFO over Elgin, Illinois. Ground observers who directed the pursuit, in which another jet pilot took part, described the object as \"five times as bright as a star\" until it vanished. * * * THIRTY YEARS AGO - August 1957: In a new statement on UFOs, Radio Moscow declared that flying discs have never been sighted over Russian territory. The broadcast was made on the 13th. On the same day Josephs. Mans, Democratic candidate for the 13th Congressional District in New Jersey called for a complete Congressional investigation of flying discs. Mans said he was convinced that a threat of interplanetary invasion exists. In addition he urged \"complete cooperation with other nations to prevent international panic, if and when the agressors from outer space arrive.\" * * * TWENTY-FIVE YEARS AGO - August 1962: During late August, Marilyn Chenarides and her mother, Mrs. Mildred Anderson, had a close encounter while on vacation at Lake Movil in the Minnesota wilds. \"We were looking out our cabin window when we saw this really bright red object hovering over our dock about 50 feet away. It appeared from nowhere, looked to be about eight feet tall and two car-lengths long, and was oval shaped with a smaller oval on top which had three triangular windows,\" Mrs. Chenarides said. \"Yellow light was shining from the windows and we could see the silhouettes of three human-like people. They were about the size of ordinary men and appeared to be staring at us. We watched for several minutes. Then my mother turned out the cabin lights. As soon as she did, the lights in the object went out, too. Mother suddenly rushed out and dashed toward the object. But when she was about halfway to it, the object slowly started to rise and veered away at a tangent.\" TWENTY YEARS AGO - August 1967: Stanley Moxon was driving north on Highway 15 near Joyceville, Ontario, Canada at 4 a.m. on the 23rd, when he saw a huge, glowing object \"as big as a house\" come out of the darkened skies and land in a field beside the highway, where several occupants got out and walked around. The 21- year-old bachelor and unshakeable skeptic when it came to UFOs said: \"The light was so bright it was like daylight. Never seen anything like it.\" Moxon said the object disappeared around a bend in the road and when he drove around the bend \"the ship was sitting in the field, 500 to 1000 feet away.\" Moxon sat in his car with the lights off watching three beings about three-feet tall walking around. \"They seemed to be walking around picking up specimens of earth and plants. They looked white, with bubbles over their heads.\" When Moxon turned on his lights at high beam to get a better look at the beings, they got back in their ship and vanished into the air within seconds. \"The ship looked like an upside-down bowl. It was on three legs. It didn't make a sound. Just zoom, and it was gone. You tell yourself, 'this can't be happening.'\" Moxon reported the incident to police at Smith Falls and learned hundreds of other people in the area reported seeing lights that morning. Police found burn marks in the ground and three impressions which indicated 100,000 pounds of pressure. Within 12 hours Moxon was visited by two U.S. Air Force investigators. The lengthy \"interrogation\" ended with the investigators saying they would report their findings to him and advising him to keep his mouth shut about the sighting. He never saw them again. About 5 p.m. the following day, a man in his early twenties (name withheld), who raced motorcycles as a hobby, was riding to Melbourne, Australia at about 70 mph when he was suddenly surrounded by a bluish-white light which came from a blinding source above him. When he stopped his bike he took off his sunglasses and rubbed his eyes. And off the road 100 feet to the left, hovering about four feet above the ground was a disc-shaped object. It was like one table saucer placed rim-to-rim 19"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"on another, about 25 or 30 feet wide, silver in color on top and black or dark brown underneath, with a dome and little bubble on top. There was an insignia, which he could not read because it was partly obscured by the curve of the object. A car passed by him on the road, and he made an attempt to flag it down without success. When he turned back to the object, two figures were standing in front of it although there was no opening in the object. They had human shapes, were between 5 and 5 l / 2 feet tall, of medium build, and covered from neck to toe in a close-fitting, apparently seamless silver suit. On their necks were tight-fitting opaque helmets, like inverted goldfish bowls. \"We looked at one another for about a minute, then I took a pace towards them. They did the same,\" said the witness. \"We stood looking for maybe another minute, then one of them raised his hand and beckoned to me. I was suddenly gripped by an unreasonable fear which I had never experienced before. I panicked, jumped on my bike and rode off. \"I was doing more than 100 mph — my bike is capable of 130 — when I heard a humming sound. It must have been very loud to have reached me through my crash helmet and above the sound of my bike and the wind. I looked back and the object was following me — remaining at a constant distance of about 20 feet away on my left and about 100 feet off the ground. It was surrounded by a pinkish color. I realized I couldn't get away from it, so I stopped, hoping to find somewhere to . hide. The object glowed and stopped, hanging in the air. The hum subsided, but didn't altogether disappear. It sat there for about 30 seconds, then the color began to change from pink to deep red that was quite hard to look at. It tilted to about a 45-degree angle, and left at a fantastic speed. There was no question of acceleration. It went from naught to 2000 or 3000 miles per hour in an instant.\" * * * FIFTEEN YEARS AGO - August 1972: Police Sergeant Paul Carter of the Colby, Kansas Police Department, speaking on his feelings and personal theories about UFOs said, \"I was a firm 20 non-believer until seven minutes after two this morning, and I found I could change my mind pretty .fast.\" Describing his encounter on the 19th, Carter said he watched a huge object, estimated to be 30-35 feet long and 18- 20 feet in height, hover only about a quarter-mile away from his patrol car. Twice he was able to make out a general shape of the object describing it as resembling a cereal bowl turned upside down, and hovering about 10-15 feet off the ground. Suddenly, Carter said, the object \"turned into a very bright white light,\" becoming so intense he could not bear to look at it. The sudden flood of light revealed jackrabbits sitting in the field as if it were daylight. As the light intensity first began to build up, Carter said, \"It seemed like it was dripping a little of this white stuff off, but I could not see it touch ground; I only saw that for a few seconds.\" Then, with no further warning, the hovering object \"made a whooshing noise similar to a vacuum cleaner\" and sped straight up into the sky, the intense white light going out as it lifted off. \"From the time it took off until it was completely out of sight could not have been more than three seconds. A second officer, Dennis Brown, approaching Carter's position from the northeast, said, \"I could see the glow coming up from behind a hill.\" He then spotted the hurtling object as it rocketed into the sky. * * * TEN YEARS AGO - August 1977: A silver vehicle with two white lights beaming from the bottom was spotted over Casco township, Michigan, on the llth, about 4 a.m. by three police officers. The vehicle appeared to be large and round, but as it passed over and slightly south of the witnesses one of its spotlights shined down on them making night vision impossible for a few seconds. It was 200 to 300 feet above the ground and traveling an estimated 20 to 30 mph. The two spotlights were 10 to 15 feet apart and cast a directional beam which was conically-shaped and pointed down, and was soundless. COORDINATOR NAMED To enchance MUFON's primary function, the Board of Directors established the position of Investigations Coordinator at its June 28 meeting in conjunction with the 18th Annual UFO Symposium. Dan Wright, Central States Regional Director, has accepted the position which covers all investigated UFO activity in the U.S. and Canada. MUFON members should carefully review the following submittal and assessment system adopted by the Board. The expanded procedures assure prompt evaluation of cases and up-to-date records for all state and provincial directors: 1.) The case record of original materials is to be sent to the state or provincial director for review and duplication. 2.) The original packet should be forwarded to the international headquarters and a copy sent to the investigations coordinator. Materials unable to be duplicated are included with the coordinator's copy. 3.) The coordinator will screen the entire report for completeness, consistency of factual statements, and overall clarity of the report. A log number is then assigned. 4.) Utilizing a standardized format, the coordinator will note any additional information needed for an incomplete report. A case record verified as complete will be rated as to type, strangeness and credibility. 5.) Copies of the evaluation will be sent to the investigator, state/ provincial director and international director. 6.) Supplemental materials to render a case record complete should be distributed as in Steps 1 and 2, including the assigned log number. Note: More detailed instructions have been mailed to all state and provincial directors for immediate implementation."},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"IN OTHERS WORDS By Lucius Farish Dr. R. Leo Sprinkle of the University of Wyoming, who has been involved in the investigations of many UFO abduction cases, is apparently an abductee himself. At least, that is the subject of an article in the June 23 issue of NATIONAL ENQUIRER. Dr. Sprinkle, under hypnotic regression, recalled a childhood experience in which he was taken aboard a UFO and given a message by a very tall man whose face he remembered from previous \"nightmares.\" The July issue of FATE has a very interesting article by Paul T. Collins, detailing the events of the \"Battle of Los Angeles\" in 1942, when anti-aircraft batteries fired on various aerial objects which were thought to be invading Japanese aircraft. From Collins' descriptions of the objects he and others saw, it seems clear that UFOs were involved, rather than any type of earthly aircraft. The Eduard \"Bi|ly\" Meier case and Gary Kinder's book, LIGHT YEARS, are the subject of the \"Anti- Matter/UFO Update\" column in the July issue of OMNI. Needless to say, nothing is settled. The latest two booklets in Loren Gross' continuing UFOs: A HISTORY series are now available at $6.00 each. These are: 1952: January-May; 1952: June-July 20th. All the booklets in the series are the same approximate length (around 100 pages, plus index). The volume of material to be covered for flap years such as 1952 requires several booklets, whereas \"quieter\" years such as 1951 can be summarized in one booklet.

Extrapolating, from approximately 140 abductions cases he has investigated, Budd Hopkins suggests that perhaps 100,000 or more have occurred world- wide. Hopkins believes one alien motive involves genetic experiments, including interbreeding with humans. Interbreeding strongly implies (perhaps mandates) that the species be related. Hypothesis: Aliens' agenda requires abductions/genetic experiments. Aliens advise government leaders of this necessary agenda and their desire to be as minimally disruptive of the psychological, social, religious and political lives of their Earthly cousins, as \"humanly?\" possible. Leaders agree they have a large stake in the maintenance of the status quo and, by creating a curtain of ridicule regarding the UFO phenomena, few would dare report an abduction experience and fewer would believe it or be impacted by the profound implications. Robert H. Bletchman Manchester, CT Dear Editor, I propose that Captain Nash's large, narrow, dimly illuminated, cloudlike crescent (No. 230, June 1987) was in fact a close nightflying formation of birds reflecting ground lights. I witnessed a very similar phenomenon 18 years ago from my yard in Waltham, MA. (A copy of my NICAP sighting report with accompanying sketch is enclosed.) What I saw was a whitish, diffuse, boomerang-shaped \"object\" moving silently northward against the night sky, altering its shape slightly to a crescent 22 as it proceeded! The Massachusetts Audubon Society confirmed that not only did the description of migrating geese at night reflecting light match my sighting, but also MAS had received a similar report about the same time from Weston. That town lies adjacent to Waltham. I believe night-flying bird formations explain some of the crescent- and boomerang-shaped UFOs reported over the past years. Warning signals should be the wispy or fuzzy outline and very faint contrast of the crescent against the night sky, indicating the reflection of lights off the birds' bellies and wings. Flocks of birds, however, cannot account for many of the Hudson Valley boomerangs, which : have been described in many cases as carrying multic.olored light sources, and sometimes emitting a humming sound and hovering. Walter N. Webb MUFON Astronomy Consultant Dear Editor, Concerning the series of papers , pertaining to the Communion book, and found in the May, 1987 issue of MUFON, this is to commend Michael Swords for his two-part topology, and for his progress in developing one of the two branches in an attempt to comprehend the Strieber experience. Items B thru D are cognitively challenging, and items C and D have exciting implications. But in consideration of previous work done by Hopkins and others, the Strieber experience, with its varied unfoldment, does not appear to be significantly different from various other abduction reports. The rope of sand is Swords initial paragraph. While conceivably correct in his conclusion, he has chosen the internally activated motivation as taking precedence over the externally activated because, as he says, of \"the extreme poverty of external impact.\" Swords choice of dichotomy-branches leaves one open to the hazard of establishing the wrong dichotomy- branch because, at the moment, there ,, is a paucity of obvious external • causation. Since Strieber had not , apparently been initially knowledgeable v > of the UFO phenomenon, the correspondence of his materials with other \"known\" abductees should cause one to at least be skeptical of the dichotomy-branch chosen by Mr. Swords. Should Strieber not wish to hypnotically dig more deeply into his experience, we may never be able to make a clear decision. But similarities to other abduction reports should cause us to be most cautious in concurring with the Swords approach. Hopefully, Strieber's expectations of UFO investigator views will turn out to be overly anxious. Should he be correct, this will surely be a serious commentary on field investigator mind set. Finally, it appears that Anne Druffel is disturbed by what she senses the book should be but isn't, and there is concern expressed for Strieber's views and for the manner in which the public will interpret .them. Strieber provides various possible explanations in an attempt to comprehend what has taken place in his life. He does not have the answers and frankly admits to such. Does Anne Druffel have the answers? Perhaps the UFO phenomenon will turn out to be even stranger than any of us ever imagined.

Curving westward from Polaris the North Star is the much fainter Little Dipper. Between the Little Dipper and the crooked \"W\" of Cassiopeia the Queen lies something shaped like an upsidedown house with a peaked roof-Cepheus the King. Look for a small right triangle of stars at the upper right corner of the king's \"house.\" The lower star in the triangle is Delta Cephei, the prototype of the Cepheid variable stars. The supergiant star expands and contracts in a regular period of 5.4 days, doubling its brightness to the naked eye from magnitude 4.4 to 3.5 and back again during that interval. Through a unique luminosity/period- of-variation relationship, Cepheid variables are important distance indicators, allowing astronomers to measure the distances to far-off galaxies that contain these stars. 23"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"DIRECTOR'S MESSAGE by Walt Andrus The August 1987 issue of the MUFON UFO JOURNAL commem- orates the Eighteenth Annual MUFON UFO Symposium held on June 26, 27, and 28 in Washington, D.C., hosted by the Fund for UFO Research. This symposium will undoubtedly be recognized in UFO history as the most significant event of its kind in the past forty years and inaugurate a positive radical change in the future of Ufology. As the theme stated \"International Symposium on Unidentified Aerial Phenomena: 1947 - 1987,\" or subtitled \"Forty Years is Long Enough,\" speakers from every continent of the World appeared. The international importance of the MUFON UFO symposium was bolstered by \"The 4th International UFO Congress\" held July 10,11, and 12 at the London Business School in England and the meetings by the International Committee for UFO Research (ICUR) on July 9th and the MUFON European meeting on July 13th. Individual articles about each of these events will appear in future issues of the Journal. Decisions made by the MUFON Board of Directors on major issues will also be reported, as will those by the P.I.P.E: Committee after their meetings in Washington, D.C. Briefly, the most important actions concerned the establishment of the position of Investigative Coordinator filled by Dan Wright (Central Regional Director); the Field Investigator's Examination administered by the State/Provincial Directors and graded by Mrs. Shirley Coyne; and the proposed MUFON Media Policy Guidelines. * * * The International Committee for UFO 1 Research (ICUR) was revitalized with the election of new officers for the next two years: Robert S. Digby, Chairman; Walter H. Andrus, Jr., Vice Chairman; Stephen J. Gamble, i Dr. Willy Smith Secretary; and John L. Spencer, Treasurer. A vote of confidence and gratitude was extended to the retiring chairman Bertil Kuhlemann of Sweden for his work as one of the founding members and his leadership continuity. * * * In addition to the four new books published in the U.S.A. in 1987, with more in the offing, the following new books have recently been released in Great Britain: The UFO Conspiracy by Jenny Randies (Blandford Press); Aboue Top Secret by Timothy Good (Sidgwick and Jackson); and UFOs 1947-1987 edited by Hilary Evans with John Spencer (Fortean Tomes) for The British UFO Research Association. One source for these three books is Lionel Beer, 15 Freshwater Court, Crawford Street, London, W1H 1HS England. Vincente- Juan Ballester Olmos and Juan A. Fernandez Peris have authored a new book in Spanish titled Enciclopedia de los Encuentros Cercanos con O VMS (Plaza & Janes) Spain. As an aid to Field Investigators, Dan Wright has published a pamphlet titled Interviewing the UFO Witness, a 23 page, 8000-word booklet covering all aspects of the interview process. It is available for $3.50 including mailing costs from Mr. Wright by writing and enclosing a check or money order to 228 South Fairview, Lansing, MI 48912. Ronald D. Story is presently producing a second, revised, updated, and expanded edition of The Encyclopedia of UFOs. For people who would like to revise their previous contribution to his book, Mr. Story may be contacted at 7744 Bristol Court, St. Petersburg, Florida 33709 or by telephone (813) 541-6391.
