POSTMASTER: Send form 3579 to advise change of address to The MUFON UFO JOURNAL, 103 Oldtowne Rd., Seguin, Texas 78155. 1 FROM THE EDITOR The alleged abduction of Harry Joe Turner in Virginia, reported in this issue, provides a microcosm of the problems facing UFO investigators today. Never has \"strangeness\" been; higher, nor evaluation of credibility more difficult. The need for expert intervention by specialists in various fields is apparent in this case and many others like it. Although Turner does not have a good reputation among acquaintances, those closest to him feel that something must have happened. Also, his report came in the midst of many similar ones here and abroad. Is Turner crazy, or was he an unfortunate victim of inexplicable happenings, foredoomed to be a poor witness because of his reputation? Many of the reports come from citizens of good reputation. What is the answer? As investigator Fred Whiting suggests, psychological testing is needed. We strongly endorse that view, along with the general need for meticulous, professional investigation of these widespread and perplexing reports so that the true causes might ultimately be determined.

He and the vehicle • were taken, he believes, to a planet 2.5 light years beyond Alpha Centauri, the closest star to our sun, 4.3 light years away. He woke up 3 l / 2 hours later in Fredericksburg, Va., 80 miles from Winchester. Both mileage indicators on the truck, he says, show he travelled only 17 miles. A possible second abduction on September 8 also is suggested. The case features damage to the truck, electromagnetic effects, physical and psychological after-effects, and memory loss. Although it has many similarities to other \"abduction\" cases, it also contains details which are unique to this case. I first learned of the'incident from an article.in the Richmond (Va.) Times- Dispatch, September 23, 1979. An account was first published in. the Winchester Evening Star, September 18.1 met with Turner and his family for over 4 hours on October 29,1979, and taped a 3-hour interview. On this and subsequent trips to obtain more evidence, I was assisted by Barbara Peter, an Assistant Professor of Psychiatric Mental Health Nursing at a well-respected medical school, and John Guritner, a professional photographer and private investigator in the Washington, D.C., metropolitan area. In addition, I consulted with Isabel Davis, Don Berliner, and Richard Hall of MUFON, Help and advice also was obtained from Ted Bloecher, John Carlson, Bruce Maccabee, and David Swartzman. The Story Harry Joe Turner lives in Winchester with his wife, Regiria, who works in her mother's restaurant. Turner is an ex-Navy hull technician (employing the skills of welding and plumbing), an amateur boxer, avid hunter, and donor of 27 pints of blood. Although under medication during the first interview, Turner was responsive to the questions and gave thought to his answers. His only nervous habit was excessive smoking; formerly a moderate smoker, he now smokes several packs of cigarettes and several cigars daily. He appeared to be a credible witness who had undergone a severely traumatic experience and who was trying to find an explanation. On August 28, Turner was driving his truck from Winchester to Fredericksburg, where he was to deliver a load of ketchup and mustard. Before leaving, he took two Tylenol for a headache and drank a Mountain Dew (soft drink). At approximately 11:15 p.m. two miles from Warrenton on Route 17, his AM/FM and Citizens Band (CB) radios began emitting static. Turner heard a high-pitched noise and saw a light in both side-view mirrors. The noise got louder and the light got larger, and an object bigger than the truck came over the top of the cab. Turner heard two thumps on the roof. At this point, something with \"bionic strength\" seized Turner's left shoulder \"at a pressure point\" (Turner also professed to be a student of martial arts). He later remembered grabbing his .32 caliber revolver and firing all eight shots into an \"unseen entity.\" Then he blacked out. Turner awoke in Fredericksburg at the warehouse where he was to deliver his cargo. He found himself on the passenger side of the cab; the seat on the driver's side was buckled. With part of his memory returning, he inspected the \"sleeper\" section of the cab. His $300 in cash, $15 in change, and credit cards were untouched, but his personal belongings were scattered Harry Joe Turner (Photo: John Guritner) about and his tools were laid out on the ground. His watch read 11:17, but the warehouse clock showed it was 3:00 a.m..(Note: The Warren, Minn., police case of August 27 in which watch and clock showed a time discrepancy was not reported in the press until August 29.); Both his odometer and hubometer, Turner said, indicated he had travelled only 17 miles, whereas it is an 80-mile trip between the two cities. He .later discovered the truck had consumed 114 gallons of fuel, enough to make the trip three times. Also, the. truck's CB antenna was burned and frayed along 2 inches at the top and a section of the AM/FM radio antenna appeared to have been \"sheared off.'\" He later discovered a \"film\" covering the entire truck. As Turner was trying to figure out what had happened, another trucker pulled into the parking lot. He got out of the cab and went to the back of the truck to unload his cargo, apparently ignoring Turner. Harry Joe tried to get his attention, but the trucker took no notice. The next morning, the same man greeted Turner and commented (continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"WtfNCHE bll Radii .r^\"i:oi ft I #\"£<>.... \\*L L «3 Cnoie'sviie^V- 1 •'' j 1 * 1.

When Turner asked why the man had ignored him the previous night in the parking lot, the driver walked away, muttering something about \"pill-popping kids.\" After unloading his cargo, Turner left for Winchester, but was so confused that he had to ask a police officer for directions out of town. On the highway he pushed his rig up over the speed limit, but he noticed that his eyes were acutely sensitive to light. Back in Winchester he related his experience to Terminal Manager Bill Little. Then he went home to rest up for a scheduled trip to Pennsylvania that evening. Around 9:00 p.m., with his family watching, Turner started to jump into his truck, but suddenly blacked out, fell and struck his head. He awoke at Winchester Hospital with a light shining in his eyes. Reacting violently, he grabbed the doctor. After calming him down, the doctor conducted an examination. According to the family, the diagnosis was \"a busted blood vessel\" in his eye. Harry Joe told the doctor about his UFO experience, and the doctor referred him to Winchester psychiatrist, Dr. Bruce Gray. Conscious Memories Back home, Harry Joe turned his gun over to his family, noticing for the first time that the clip was empty. It was then that he remembered firing all eight shots at the \"entity.\" Gradually he remembered the truck being lifted up into the object, whereupon he lost consciousness. His next memory is of being, inside a craft where he was examined- by human-like beings wearing white shirts and pants, and white caps that covered their ears and foreheads. Turner said they occasionally lifted the caps, revealing a series of numbers across their faces, the entities also had an unusual (compared to humans) amount of flesh between their fingers, extending to the first knuckle of each finger. When they spoke to each other, their voices sounded like \"a tape recorder played backwards — fast.\" Only one of the entities cummunicated with Turner, by slowing down his speech. This entity, which had no numbers across his forehead, identified himself by a name which sounded like ALPHA LA ZOO LOU. The entity asked Turner his name, to which he replied \"Harry Joe Turner.\" Thereafter, the entity addressed him as \"Harry.\" Turner was questioned at length, but his memory of the questions is vague, although he remembers being asked about his truck's transmission (an unusual model with 20 speeds). Turner felt compelled to answer all (continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"(Abduction, Continued) questions, truthfully. The entities' complexions were very pale, with skin that was cold to the touch \"like they was dead.\" He believes the entities have the ability to replace lost body parts with \"bionic\" ones, and that some were stronger than others because of this. They had the ability to move from . one place to another rapidly, \"before you can blink an eye. . .you can't keep up with them.\" He believes they come from a highly advanced civilization. \"Compared to them,\" he said, \"we're just a bunch of walkin' idiots.\" The physical examination was conducted only on the left side of Turner's body with \"tools\" of some kind. He believes something was implanted in his left chest, near the shoulder; however, his family said that subsequent X-rays revealed nothing abnormal. Turner feels that the entities continue to control the left side of his body, and that they can \"see\" what he sees through his left eye. He says they communicate with him by a ringing sound that begins in his left ear. Later, Turner remembered being , taken to a planet which he believes is 2.5 light years beyond Alpha Centauri. He described dome-covered cities \"in a land that looks like the future of this planet.\" He had the impression that their world had been devastated by a nuclear holocaust. On the way there, the craft stopped on the moon's surface, where he observed footprints left by the astronauts. He has no conscious memory of the trip home. Aftermath Since the experience, Turner has been acutely sensitive to light and sound. He occasionally receives what he describes as \"messages,\" usually preceded by a ringing in his ears. His high state of anxiety is reduced somewhat by his doctor's prescriptions for tranquilizers. According to Turner's mother-in-law, the psychiatrist's initial conclusion was that \"something's definitely gotten ahold of the boy's nerves.\" Despite medication — or perhaps partly because of it — Turner's behavior since the experience has, on occasion, been bizarre. On September 3, after taking five Turner reconstructs moment of encounter. [Photo: John Guhtner) Valium instead of the prescribed dosage of one, he felt a need to get out of the house because \"the walls were closing in.\" He took his mother-in-law's car for a ride. When a rescue squad ambulance passed him with its siren on, the loud noise set him off and he hit the accelerator. After leading as many as 10 law enforcement officers on a wild chase through several counties at speeds exceeding 110 m.p.h., he was apprehended (in a scuffle with police) and charged with reckless driving and failure to yield to a police siren and flashing lights. On September 8, Turner felt an urge to return to the scene of the abduction. \"They want me to go back,\" he told his family at the time. \"I know too much.\" When he returned home several hours later, his body, clothes and truck were soaking wet. When his family asked for an explanation, he replied, \"they told me they wouldn't take nothing aboard their spaceship unless it was sterilized....lasked them where we were going, and they said 'nowhere; we only need you for a minute and we're done with you now'.\" The craft resembled an \"upside-down ashtray.\" He could not recall all that had happened. Once the entities returned and seized him with that same \"bionic\" grip, saying, \"The only story they are going to get out of you is that this was all made up. They'll never get the real answers now.\" On another occasion while out driving, he found himself disoriented and confused at a local shopping mall. He asked several passersby to call his family, but they ignored him. Finally, at about 1:30 a.m., a bearded man wearing a white robe, satin belt, and sandals approached him, addressing him as \"my son.' Turner asked the man to call his family; he declined an offer of change for the phone call and disappeared. Shortly afterward he returned and told Turner someone was coming to pick him up. He said he would not stay long enough to be seen by anyone else because \"my time has not yet come.\" The man vanished shortly before the police arrived. Turner was taken to the police station where his family, alerted by an anonymous telephone cadi met him. Afterward, Turner went to see his minister. He was surprised to see a picture of the man at the shopping mall in the pastor's study: it was a depiction of Jesus. (In relating this later, tears came to Harry Joe's eyes as if in gratitude for help in a desperate situation.) Although not previously religious, Turner now constantly wears a small gold cross around his neck and (continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"(Abduction, Continued) carries a Bible. He goes to church and reads religious pamphlets in an effort to find some meaning behind his experience.  , He also sleeps with a gun under his pillow, although he realizes it was of no use during his abduction. Despite his high level of anxiety, and in spite of the talismans he carries for protection, Turner feels the entities won't harm him. In fact, when asked if he would go aboard the spacecraft again, he replied \"yes.\" He remembers a symbol that he .saw on the wall of the craft which looked like a 7 with an X through it, and he believes he has a year to find that symbol elsewhere. Turner says he has since seen the entities on several occasions, although his family reports seeing nothing. Once he felt that they chased him out of the house; another time he chased them out of the house and fought with one of them in the corn field behind the house. His family said he appeared to be hitting something, .but it wasn't visible. Turner has also had crying spells, breathing difficulties, and some apparent ESP experiences. Once he looked at his wife and saw only a skeleton. Sometimes he feels he can see the sky through the ceiling. He has experienced strange cravings for bananas, grapefruit, coconuts, tomatoes, and deer meat — foods he previously disliked. (His family confirms this.) Although he still feels a general weakness on his left side (he demonstrated a comparatively weak grip with his left hand), at times his left side is stronger than usual. He believes he can now move more easly through the woods, making him a better hunter. The Investigation Physical Evidence. Unfortunately, there is relatively little physical evidence which can be documented to support Harry Turner's claims. The crucial evidence — the alleged 17-mile trip from Winchester to Fredericks- burg and the gasoline useage.— are contained in a file which Turner has promised to turn over to the investigator. However, in December, Turner said the file was missing, along with his Navy records, birth certificate, and some UFO questionnaire data sheets. \"Half my mind says I know where they are,\" he said; \"and the other half says, 'Don't reveal it'.\" Because? \"No because,\" he said. Turner's Terminal Manager, Bill Little, was unable to verify the odometer readings and gasoline useage. . The truck antennas have been turned over to the Center for UFO Studies for analysis by the same laboratory which examined the patrol car of Minnesota Deputy Sheriff Val Johnson, whose close encounter with a UFO occurred less than 24.hours before Turner's. The results of the analysis of Turner's antennas is not yet available. . . Turner's Credibility. Therefore, as with most abduction cases, the credibility of the witness is of utmost importance. Here, too, there are problems. Turner enjoys a general reputation in Winchester as a braggart and teller of tall tales. \"Harry has what I describe as an elephant's mouth and a humminbird's ass,\" says Terminal Manager Little. His mechanic puts it just as colorfully: 'Harry Turner is as full of shit as a Christmas turkey.\" His mother, Rosaleen, says Turner \"can stretch the truth.\" Even his mother-in-law, Marjorie Haymaker, says, \"If you hurt some, Harry Joe hurts more.\"' What do his family and friends think happened to him the night of August 28th? Here, opinions differ: . \"He might make it up, but he wouldn't take it this far. I don't think he Would torture himself -for something that wasn't true.\"—Marjorie Haymaker, mother-in-law. \"Something definitely had to happen, or he feels that it happened.\"— Rosaleen Turner, mother. \"He was quite distraught. The experience was extremely real to him. I don't thing he made it up.\"—Rev. Bruce Macbeth, minister. \"He could have made it up. I call Harry a bluff.\"—John Hayman, former boss. \"I have three theories about this: one, it really happened; two, it was Harry Turner's time to crack; .three, Harry's ashamed of something that he did that night.\"—Bill Little, Terminal Manager and former policeman. Medical Records. Harry Turner has a long medical history of various minor physical complaints, including injuries suffered in a truck accident on Sept. 28, 1976 when he was pinned inside the cab for four hours. Since his abduction experience on Aug. 28, 1979, Turner has seen four physicians, including a psychiatrist. With their patient's written authorization, they have released his medical records. A summary of their findings:    • Edward G. Thompson, M.D. (an ear, nose, and throat specialist): \"This man is very difficult to evaluate. He says he was exposed to some kind of third world encounter and now has photophobia and any kind of noise hurts his ears. I am unable to really find anything wrong with this man. I think he needs to see a psychiatrist.\" Dr. Thompson noted on the audiogram that \"at 25dB, patient threw headphones off and screamed. Said that the tone was loud. Complained of - 'them' talking to him. Could not test his hearing.\"—Sept. 4, : 1979 John H. Armstrong, M.D., in a report made Sept. 5th: \"His physical exam yesterday was unremarkable, with evidence of hypertension or neurologic disease.\" In his initial report made the same day, Bruce M. Gray, M.D.\" (a psychiatrist): \"This young man probably has a marked hysterical personality disorder and experienced a fugue state, either that or he is experiencing a type of hysterical psychosis.\" . Turner was referred to a neurologist, George Li Sheppard, M.D., whose conclusion in a Sept. 25th report was \"Impression: Conversion reaction.\"* After subsequent examinations, Dr. Gray reported on Oct. 1st: \"He is .still symptomatic. He is suffering in my opinion from a hysterical neurosis, conversion type. He is not malingering, although unquestionably, there is significant secondary gain to his illness.\"  \" • \" Conclusions The evaluation of Turner's doctors (continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"FRENCH AUTHORITIES ARE BAFFLED BY STORY ABOUT A VANISHING MAN (Reprinted from the Houston (Texas) Chronicle, December 3, 1979) CERGY-PONTOISE, France (AP) - Authorities in this small town northwest of Paris are trying to decide whether to charge Frank Fontaine and his friends with criminal mischief or launch a search for a mysterious glowing unidentified flying object. \"This is just too fantastic,\" said Police Chief Roger Courcous after listening to the testimony of Fontaine, 19, and his two friends, Jean-Pierre Prevot and Salomon N'Diaye, both 25. Fontaine, who had been the object of a police search since last Monday, reappeared today in the exact spot where he disappeared a week ago, his friends reported. They said he was wearing the same clothes and had exactly the same amount of money as the day he vanished. Police said the three have consistently repeated this same story under long questioning: At 4 a.m. last Monday, the three young men had just finished loading a station wagon with clothes they were , going to sell at an open market when they saw a brilliant light about the size of a tennis ball to the right of the car. The ball became larger and larger and came to a rest/on the hood of the car, causing their eyes to burn. From that moment, until his reappearance this morning. Fontaine says he remembers nothing. Prevot and N'Diaye left Fontaine to watch the car as they ran home to get a camera. When they returned, they said, their friend was gone. According to them, the car was there with the door open and a halo of light surrounded the car. The halo suddenly disappeared. Just as mysteriously as he vanished, Fontaine reappeared at 4:30 a.m. today, in exactly the same spot, the story went. When he saw the car was gone, he thought it had been stolen and rushed to the house of N'Diaye. Seeing his friend in his pajamas, he said: \"What are you doing in your pajamas? Five minutes ago you were ready to leave for Gisors.\" Police checked the young man and the spot where he supposedly disappeared with a geiger counter but found no trace of radioactivity. Nor was there any trace of mud on Fontaine's clothes or shoes. Courcous said Fontaine has not varied his story one bit and his tale conforms exactly with the testimony of his two friends. But police remain skeptical and have called in experts from the Group for the Study of Non- Identified Aerospace Phenomena, a section of the French National Space Agency. Editor's Note: An investigation report from France presently is being translated. More information will be reported when available. (Abduction, Continued) and associates makes it clear something traumatic has occurred. The main question is, what — if anything — happened to him on the night of August 28th that has led to his neuroses? I don't think this investigation will be complete without psychological testing and evaluation by a psychiatrist or psychologist familiar with the UFO phenomenon. Hypnosis might be used to uncover memories blocked by Turner's conscious mind. (Postscript: At last report from his family, Harry Joe was threatening to 'run off and join the aliens.'

You know: the long-suppressed official knowledge that some of the reported UFO's are indeed alien spacecraft? That theoretical question has been in the back of my mind all during the recent freedom-ofMnformation breakthroughs engendered by persistent UFO researchers. Every time I view a formerly classified UFO- related document, or set of such documents, I wonder why none of them bears a security classification above \"SECRET.\" Hasn't anyone for the past 33 years of official UFOlogy ever used his/her authority to categorize any UFO data as \"TOP SECRET!? Well, if you can accept the evidence published in the memoirs of the late USAF Project Bins Book chief, Capt. Edward J. Ruppzlt (The Report on Unidentified Flying Objects; Doubleday, NYC, 1956, two editions), there was at least one document in the TOP SECRET category. Its one-time existence now all but confirmed by Air Force public-affairs responses to inquiries from the public, the document in question, a 1948 AF intelligence \"estimate of the situation\" declaring UFO's to be of interplanetary origin, was ordered destroyed by the then AF Chief of Staff when he rejected the hypothesis as unsupportable by the evidence thus far presented. Other than that official \"nondocument\" (a copy of which would fetch its owner about $150 on the collector's market), what about the elusive Project Blue Book Special Report No. 13? Oh, I know, the Government consistently denies that this phobicly numbered member of the family of 14 formerly CONFIDENTIAL/ SECRET status reports ever existed. (Which makes me wonder how we can rely on the technical competence of anyone whose triskaidekaphobia influences, his official decisions.) But 8 rumor has it that a copy of \"No. 13\" was seen some years ago behind the closed doors of that Air Force-sponsored \"think tank\" in Santa Monica, Calif.— the RAND Corporation. This is the same outfit that used to deny any involvement with official UFOlogy, other than keeping a few UFO books on its library shelves. Now, of course, we know different (e.g., see the 43-page RAND monograph UFO: What to Do, dated November 27, 1968). Right Answer, Wrong Question Back in the summer of 1975, a UFO researcher paid the sum of $22.50 for an 11-page response by the U.S. Defense Documentation Center to his freedom-of-information request for a computer printout of the center's bibliogrdr'h r. catalogue of official UFOlogy publications. What he got for his money fell short of what he'd expected to get via this wording of his request: A ... computer-printout compilation • ('report bibliography') on the subject of .Unidentified Flying Objects (UFO) and Flying Saucers — covering the period January 1, 1969 — June 30, 1975; encompassing all pertinent entries from technical memoranda/reports, industrial contract specifications, trade-journal articles, interim/final reports of consulting firms, monthly/quarterly progress reports, R&D reports, test-evaluation summaries, technical notes, project-status reports, reports-control/processing directives, intelligence estimates, military-student research papers, and any other such publication; and citing a full identification for each entry (author(s)'s names, publisher's name/address, date of publication, report Number, contract Number, volume Number, and number of pages, etc.). In short, for ease of indexing/ retrieval, almost every conceivable descriptor and key-word reference was tossed into the request to assure a sweeping coverage of UFOlogical terminology and technical data. Instead of furnishing the requestor a 2-inch-thick volume of citations/ cross-references/annotations — as would be the case had he requested, say, a report on computer graphics — the Center chose to conjure up a nondescript listing that he himself could have prepared from his own library. Here's what the listing summarizes: • Reuieu; of the University of Colorado Report on Unidentified Flying Objects by a Panel of the National Academy of Sciences (Jan 69). • UFO's and Related Subjects: An Annotated Bibliography (Jul 69), published by the Library of Congress. • A Case of \"Autostasis\" or Reverse Autokinesis (Feb 68), published by University of Colorado. • Scientific Study of Unidentified Flying Objects (in 3 volumes) (Jan 69), published by University of Colorado. • UFO Project \"Sign\" (Feb 49), published by USAF Air Materiel Command, Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio: • Project Grudge Status Report No. 2 (Dec 51), published by Foreign Technology Division, Wright-Patterson AFB. • Project Blue Book Status Reports No. 9 (Jan 53) and 10 (Dec 52 - Feb 53), published by Foreign Technology Division, Wright-Patterson AFB.

Retired police officer Walter Bauer received the report at Keilee's Truck Stop at about 1 ajn. today from the motorists, woo he said \"were really shaken up.\" The UFO, described as a bright white light, swooped low over their southbound car, then sped southward. The incident happen- ed near the Waldo Junction on US2S1 Highway, the unidentified motorists told Bauer. The former officer reported the incident to police and, in turn, the happening was reported to the sheriff's office. Police said that a check at the airport fafled to turn up any report of an aircraft in the area. No other details were available today. (UFO Secrecy, Continued) failed to demand that the center's report provide an accounting (indexed by document date) of all classified (or otherwise FOIA-exempted) documents accessed by the computer search but excluded from the, printout report. It's conceivable that these censored entries might have more than quadrupled the size of the report, and that they might have included the long-sought Blue Book Report No. 13. In effect, the requestor had' asked the wrong question (i.e., specifying an unclassified printout), prompting the center to give him only what he'd asked for — and not a bit else. Now's the time to re-open that case to see just how much material was by-passed by the computer search- and-print operation. More on that at a later date. A Matter of National Security In the meantime, you may wish to ponder how the Government might be weighing and protecting its vast wealth of heretofore unreleased UFO records. For the proper perspective, you first must keep in mind this published Department of Defense definition of the term classified information: \"Official information which has been determined to require, in the interests of national security, protection against unauthorized disclosure and which has been so designated.\" Any document in this category bears what is known as a \"security classification,\" and often involves military intelligence. By Federal statute, the degree of classification is limited to three grades: CONFIDENTIAL, SECRET, and TOP SECRET (never mind that a secret is a secret is a secret). Let's suppose you're the commander of an outpost . in Greenland. Your phone rings with the details of a flying saucer's having half- buried itself upon crash-landing in a snow bank near your radar facility. While your recovery team is swinging shovels to extricate the thing, you decide to inform your States-side superiors of the event. (You're pretty sure, incidentally, that this \"thing\" is an uninvited visitor from galactic parts unknown). After you decide that this knowledge (for some reason) comes under the definition of classified information, which protective label do you apply? To help you decide, the Department of Defense offers this explanation: • CONFIDENTIAL — limited to that information/material ''the unauthorized disclosure of which could reasonably be expected to cause damage to the national security.\" Among the examples in this category are \"intelligence reports.\" • SECRET.. — limited to information/material \"the unauthoriz- ed disclosure of which could reasonably be expected to result in serious damage to the national security.\" Among the examples in this category: \"Intelligence and other information the value of which depends upon concealing the fact that the United States possess it.\" •TOP SECRET — limited to that information/material \"the unauthoriz- ed disclosure of which could reasonably be expected 1 to result in exceptionally grave damage to the national security.\" Among the examples in this category: \"Completed intelligence of such scope that it reveals a major intelligence production effort on the part of the United States and which would permit an evaluation by unauthorized recepient of the success attained by, or the capabilities of, the U.S. intelligence services.\" Once you've decided on the grade of classification (and who among us doubts that it'll be TOP SECRET?), and report it to your superiors, the matter no longer remains solely up to you as to future downgrading or upgrading. Sometimes, of course, classification- review officials do err in prematurely declassifying documents (case in point: the \"H-bomb secret\"); but you can bet that so long as UFO's remain the hottest untold story, few officials are going to step out voluntarily onto the shaky limb of official UFO-data declassification. D"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"BOOK REVIEW The Crash/Retrieval Syndrome, by Leonard H. Stringfield (MUFON, 103 Oldtowne Rd., Seguin, TX 78155) 38 p., $5.00 If \"flesh and blood\" is true, can \"nuts and bolts\" be far behind? This may be one of the most startling books you will ever read. The reviewer is among the many veteran UFO researchers who, for 30 years, has considered the \"crashed saucer and little bodies\" stories to be nonsense. So was the author, until he began receiving bits and pieces of information that caused him to take a new look at the question. His preliminary findings were reported at the 1978 MUFON Symposium in Dayton, Ohio, at which time he had begun .to uncover disturbing information. Since that time, the number of first-hand witnesses to some portion of a \"retrieval\" operation has multiplied. The picture now emerging raises a host of questions, not least of which is the possibility that the U.S. Government (and possibly others) has been hiding a Cosmic Watergate. The book proves nothing. Unless you know Len Stringfield you may be inclined to reject his \"evidence\" because most of his witnesses refuse to be identifed. Those were the terms under which they were willing to talk. But I know Len Stringfield, and I am shaken by the testimony he has obtained. He has also advised me privately of some background facts that he cannot state publicly. Only two conclusions seem possible: Either (1) an elaborate hoax is being perpetrated, or (2) a long-kept secret is starting to leak out. Furthermore, the leaks apparently are deliberate and orchestrated as to the timing and the amount of detail. Trial balloons, in other words. Several factors argue against a hoax. For one thing, similar fragments of information have trickled out over the past 30 years, but first-hand witnesses were impossible to find and the stories were not taken seriously. For another, bits and pieces of information from a wide variety of sources spanning those 30 years tend to fit together. Complicity in a hoax would now involve dozens of people, 10 and many of them did not come forth to offer the information. They were tracked down by laborious detective work. Some leads came quite by chance from friends of MUFON personnel, and one from a Stringfield in- law. Also, Stringfield has met face-to- face with one of the most significant witnesses in the latter's medical facility and there is no question about the genuineness of his position. A hoax, if not unthinkable, is at least highly improbable in this and certain other key instances. The cases are not equally . convincing, and the possibility of some apocryphal stories or \"disinformation\" efforts being mixed in still must be considered. Stringfield has elected to lay out the information he has received as fully as possible, hoping that by doing so he will encourage additional witnesses to speak out, and any false information to be discredited by further investigation. Some of the reports may be describing the same case from different perspectives, and some of the basic facts — dates and locations particularly — may be garbled. As it stands, the information suggest a 1947 and/or 1948 case; a 1950 case; a 1952 and/or 1953 case (six references); about 4 cases in the 1960's; and 2 or 3 cases in the 1970's. Allowing for possible overlap, the descriptions still seem to be of at least 9 separate events, but the numbers are uncertain. The existence of a movie film showing a crashed saucer and three small bodies was reported by four separate sources. Most surprisingly, Stringfield has now talked directly with several reputable people who claim to have personally seen one or more bodies, usually at Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio. The legend of the \"bodies in the deep freeze\" at this base, wildly touted by irresponsible publications, may be true after all! If so, then so-called responsible journalists have missed the biggest story of all time. Descriptions of a humanoid body are provided by the medical source mentioned above. A significant portion of the information also comes from an alleged CIA source who would appear to be the man (or one of them) orchestrating the information release. Stringfield reports the story of this man's role in some detail. The implications of his knowledge and his activities are most intriguing in connection with the possibility of a controlled release of information. The \"crashed saucer\" legend must now be re-examined fully on the basis of this new information. Stringfield demonstrates the need for a full-fledged research project to get to the bottom of these reports, either to prove them or to discredit them for once and for all. And if they are planted stories, the implications of Government manipulations would justify a piercing investigation of the motives and purposes behind such a long-term, complex propaganda campaign. No matter how you look at it, Stringfield is on to something of utmost importance to our society.-Richard Hall POWER BLACKOUT AS UFO SEEN (From La Opinion, Buenos Aires, November 29,1979. Translated by Jane Thomas.) STRANGE PHENOMENON IN ANIMANA. Authorities in the town of Animana in the Calchaquies Valley, Salta province (Argentina), are investigating a curious episode that has all the residents in suspense. According to statements from some of them, a very luminous, strange object passed through the region causing a prolonged blackout. Witnesses said that an intense brightness illuminated a vast sector in spite of the sky being overcast with black clouds. A driver passing at the time said, \"Suddenly the brightness, egg-shaped, climbed and at that instant the blackout occurred in the town.\" An employee of the local electric company stated that at the time of the blackout \"nothing could be done to restore the service, and shortly thereafter the electric power came back on without using the controls available in case of an energy failure.\""},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"NICAP: THE BITTER TRUTH By Richard Hall (Note: The author was Assistant Director of NICAP during the 1960's when it was a large and effective organization.) The National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena (NICAP) once was a potent force for gathering and disseminating important UFO cases and offsetting the Air Force secrecy which at the time stymied civilian efforts at investigation. Today, NICAP is a shell, doing nothing, deeply in debt, being kept alive for no apparent purpose by a strange collection of self- styled \"businessmen\" whose business acumen remains obscure. In a previous article (see No. 133, Jan.-Feb., 1979) Todd Zechel revealed the intelligence agency associations of several NICAP Board Members, including Joseph Bryan in and Charles Lombard, aide to Senator Barry Goldwater who is also on the Board. The new President as of December 1978 is Alan Hall, who has openly acknowledged that he was in covert CIA service from World War II until his recent retirement. Hall (no relation to the author) operates NICAP out of his home in Bethesda, Maryland, answering the phone and writing a few letters. He does not have the UFO case files; they remain in the possession of John L..Acuff, past president, whose \"resignation\" was accepted by the Board last December, with Acuff claiming that NICAP still owed him a few thousand dollars. Acuff remains as Chairman of the Board. Hall is a novice in the UFO field, a volunteer, allegedly taking on NICAP as a post-retirement hobby. The deterioration of NICAP over the past 10 years, under Acuff's stewardship, began when he almost immediately broke off relations with the Subcommittee and Affiliate members whose investigation/reporting network formed the backbone of the organization. Under the guise of introducing \"businesslike\" manage- ment (NICAP was on the verge of bankruptcy), Acuff negotiated a \"contracting services\" arrangement with the Board whereby he has been paid upwards of $20,000 per year for about the past 10 years, while also managing several other small associations, presumably for similar amounts of money. NICAP has been very good to Acuff, as the financial figures show. But the \"services\" by Acuff....well, it does not take much imagination to figure that out by examining the financial reports. NICAP 1978 Financial Report In NICAP's U.F.O. Investigator for June 1979 (one of its rare recent appearances), Alan Hall presents the 1978 NICAP balance sheet, reproduced here. As the data show, \"contracting services\" (JohnL. Acuff & Associates) skimmed over 80% of the income off the top, while nothing was spent for research or investigation. Not even a penny is indicated for general postage, suggesting that not a single letter was written in 1978 to members or anyone else. On the other hand, the phone bill averaged $80 per month, to what end is not explained. The long-suffering members may well be taken aback by Alan Hall's announced increase of membership dues to $15.00. For what? The newsletter has rarely been published, jnd has even then contained little original news. If the $23,000 the members spent had gone to MUFON, CUFOS, or the Fund for UFO Research — instead of to John L. Acuff & Associates — there is no telling what concrete, visible results might have been achieved. Those sorely needed dollars represent a terrible waste, and there is not the slightest doubt that they could have been better spent for UFO research, investigation, and publication, which they were not. In addition to doing almost nothing to advance the UFO cause, Acuff has left NICAP in debt. Even Alan Hall acknowledges difficulty in obtaining the exact figures from ''former management,\" but he reports \"unpaid debt claims against NICAP\" as about $21,000 as of July 31, 1978. The current \"NICAP\" clearly is not deserving of loyalty or support. The remaining members would do well to demand an accounting from the Board about those \"contracting services\" and what they have done for (or to) the organization. They could write to Senator Barry Goldwater, to his aide Charles Lombard, or to the following members of the Executive Committee of the Board: J.B. Hartranft, Jr., Box 30374, Bethesda, MD 20014;.Robert C. Richardson III, Box 141, Alexandria, VA 22313. Having met and negotiated with Lombard, Hartranft, and Richardson last year about merging NICAP with MUFON and CUFOS, and having received some very strange and unbusinesslike treatment, I would be interested in receiving copies of any replies received.

(Alan Hall) ABDUCTION REPORT FROM SCOTLAND Archer Man \"\\ Reports UFO (The following information is taken from The Sunday Post, Scotland, November 11, 1979) On Friday, November 9, Mr. Bob Taylor, 50, a-forestry worker for 15 years, was checking a forest area in Livingston, West Lothian, adjacent to the M8 Edinburgh-Glasgow motorway. It was early morning. As he rounded a corner in a tree-lined path and reached a clearing, he was suddenly faced with a silver-colored spherical \"spacecraft.\" From it emerged two creatures \"shaped like wheels with arms,\" who seized him. The creatures grabbed him by the side of the trousers and tore them, leaving scratch marks on his thighs. At this point Taylor fainted, but had the sensation of being dragged toward the craft. He had noticed a strong chemical smell,' and his normally placid red setter dog was barking furiously. When Taylor awoke he was dazed and shocked. The creatures and their craft were gone, and the grass was flattened. He crawled several hundred yards back to his van, but was too shaken to drive or to radio to his base. Instead, he walked the mile and a half to his home before contacting base. He was taken to Bangor Hospital for a checkup, then went home. Investigators examining the site found markings on the ground as if made by the legs of some machine, but no marks leading to the spot. A circular design and a series of holes were visible around the marks. Taylor was described by his boss and neighbors as a \"sensible straight- forward man.\" A 26-year-old Archer man told sheriff's deputies he was chased by \"a large, round, bright cream- colored light\" in the sky as he drove Wednesday night on State Road 346. Wilson Robinson said he first saw the unidentified object in the eastern sky and it appeared to \"dive\" at his vehicle, deputies reported.  • Robinson stopped at a friend's house to alert deputies, who ar- rived at the'scene to find \"no bright objects other than stars,\" according to Deputy L. J. Jackson. However, Robinson said the object hovered in the sky above the house and then took off toward the south at a high rate of speed, disappearing by the time deputies arrived. 12"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"By Ann Druffel Rebuttal to \"The failure of the 'science' of ufology\" By John DcHerrcra (Copyright John DcHerrera, 1979) (Note: This month's column has been contributed by John de Herrera, a tireless and effective Southern California UFO'researcher.) The October 11, 1979, issue of Neu; Scienfisf contained an article on the subject of unidentified flying objects. This article had just received a £1000 award in the Neu; Scientist/ Cutty Sark UFO essay competition. James Oberg, the author, is an engineer at NASA's Mission Control Center in Houston, Texas. He also writes many articles on space science. A glance at the title of Oberg's article tells us that ufology has somehow been a failure. The word \"science\" in quotation marks implies that ufology as a science is questionable. Then in the first paragraph of the article he states \"...the phenomenon has apparently been transformed from the property of cranks and crackpots to the subject of true scientific study.\" The rest of the article is a rambling emotional attack on UFO reports and those who investigate the reports. The content of the article clearly indicates that the author either is totally uninformed on the subject of unidentified flying objects or intends to exploit the present confused situation. The fact that this article was awarded the £1000 merely reflects on the standards and objectivity of the judges. Mass confusion about the subject of UFOs is a result of exploitation by sensation-seeking news reporters and private authors. There have been many books and motion picture document- aries spreading false information on the subject of UFOs. Speculation on who or what these things are abounds. While most people prefer to keep an open mind about UFOs, others join one of the extremist groups commonly referred to as the \"believers\" and the \"debunkers.\" The believer preaches that UFOs are extraterrestrial emissaries here to save us from self- destruction. At the other extreme, the debunker believes that UFOs, like astrology and witchcraft, are all nonsense, so he tries to dissuade others from reading any of the literature or discussing the subject in the news media. Both groups examine UFO reports searching 'for evidence to support their preconceived notions. Perhaps the largest contribution to public confusion was the mishandling of UFO reports by the United States Air Force and CIA. In stark contrast to the \"official\" Air Force debunking of UFO reports, the Air Technical Intelligence Center; Captain Ruppelt, who established Project Blue Book; Dr. Hynek, who was a consultant to the government investigation of UFOs; and others, concluded that the UFO phenomenon was very real and a very serious matter. Dr. Hynek was a confirmed skeptic when he joined in the investigation, then changed his mind when he examined the evidence. In essence, the men who investigated the reports were very impressed. Still, the \"official Air Force spolesmen\" were ordered to debunk all reports, for some as yet unknown reason. While James Oberg could find instances of hoaxes or fraud in the ranks of so-called UFO buffs (persons interested in the subject of UFOs) the same charge could be made of any discipline. Recent articles in Science magazine indicate a great deal of fraud in science and medicine.: Nov. 18, 1978 — \"Scandal in the Heavens: Renowned Astronomer Accused of Fraud\" Dec. 23, 1978 — \"Creative Penmanship in Animal Testing Prompts FDA Controls\" Aug. 17, 1979 — \"Tracing Burt's Descent to Scientific Fraud\" James Oberg is a member of an organization called the Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal. This organization was created by the American Humanist Association in 1976. The stated purpose of CSICP is \"...not to reject on a priori grounds, antecedent to inquiry, any or all (paranormal) claims, but rather to examine them openly, completely, objectively, and carefully.\" The objective stated by CSICP would be admirable — if it were true! The fact is that this group is simply engaged in a modern day \"witch hunt.\" Statements to the public by the members of CSICP reveal their true objectives and prejudices: \"We feel that it is the duty of the scientific community to show that these beliefs (UFOs, biorhythms, astrology, etc.) are utterly screwball.\" — Lee Nisbet \"I predict that the 1980s will see us relieved of the burdens of astrology, flying saucers, Jeane Dixon, the Bermuda Triangle and other idiocies\" — James Randi A highly slanderous article entitled \"UFOs Horoscopes, Bigfoot, Psychics and other nonsense,\" appeared in the March 1978 issue of Smithsonian (Continued on next page) 13"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"(California Report, Continued) magazine and in the July 1978 Readers Digest. The author, Kendrick Frazier, is the editor of a publication by CSICP. The outside cover of the Readers Digest had a banner that read: \"Authorities speak out on UFO's and other phenomena.\" In order to get some information on this \"authority.\" I interviewed his brother Jim with whom I am well acquainted. 2 The following is what he had to say: Questions: Author Answers: Jim Frazier Q: Hello, Jim. Did you read the article in Readers Digest by a Kendrick Frazier? A: Yeah! Q: Is he your brother? A: Yeah. Ha, ha, ha. He's become an authority on UFOs and he doesn't know anything about them. Q: How long has he been interested in UFOs? A: Oh, he doesn't know anything about them. He's never read anything. Q: Oh! He doesn't know anything? A: Uh huh, ha, ha, ha. He doesn't know anything but he's the editor of their magazine. This is the CSICP committee. They depend on Randi the magician and Phil Klass who study the literature. Kendrick doesn't study the literature he just studies Phil Klass. Now we know something about the qualifications, or lack of them, of the CSICP editor'. I would like to challenge the notion that Kendrick Frazier the editor, Phil Klass the debunker, James Randi the magician, and Kusche the pilot are authorities or even scientists speaking for the scientific community. Scientists are highly qualified to speak for themselves. They are individuals with varying opinions about paranormal phenomena. A poll conducted by Industrial Research magazine found that 61% of scientists and engineers tend to accept the reality of UFOs. 14 FOREIGN EXCHANGE BOOK REVIEW Donations of cancelled foreign stamps are acknowledged from Lou Parish, Plumerville, Arkansas, and the Sociedade Brasileira de Estudos Sobre Discos Voadores (S.B.E.D.V.), Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Proceeds from this program are used to support international exchange of UFO information. The Oberg article has made it very clear that there are weeds in the field of ufology. This we can agree on. Any verified criticism directed at a specific case of fraud would be a welcome contribution. The CSICP claims that UFOs, horoscopes, biorhythms, Bigfoot, etc. etc. are all the same and are nonsense, indicates how strong their biases are. They are not capable of conducting an objective evaluation of such reports. James Oberg has left the door slightly open on the subject of UFOs. Apparently he has looked at some reports and is no longer cocksure that this is all nonsense! EDITORIAL NOTES 1. Dr. Christopher Evans, one of the judges, is a Fellow of CSICP, his name listed on their letterhead. The other two judges, Dr. Bernard Dixon and Dr. Patrick Moore, are fellow contributors to OMNI where Oberg writes his skeptical UFO column. 2.

The Road to the Stars, by Iain Nicolson (N.Y.: The New American Library, 1979), 230 p., $2.75 pb. When we consider the complexities of space exploration, it's nice to have a book like this which sums it up and puts it all in perspective. Nicolson begins with primitive rocketry and ends with speculations on space colonies, interstellar travel, and aliens. The author divides the book into three parts. Part One provides background on the solar system and its parent galaxy. Nicolson describes the conditions necessary for the formation of life and concludes that our galaxy may contain at least 100 milibn life- bearing planets. Part Two begins with the history of space exploration. After a cursory look at literary excursions from Lucian to Verne, the author gives an even briefer history of modern rocketry. Only a few pages are devoted to the period from Robert Goddard to the moon landing. Any reader with a serious interest in the history of space flight will be disappointed. Of greater value are his explanations of the technology behind rocket propulsion, orbits, launch windows, etc. Various possible methods of interstellar travel are examined next. Nicolson discusses the fusion rocket, the nuclear pulse rocket, the interstellar ramjet, the laser-photon sail, anti-matter propulsion, and the photon rocket. He believes that all these methods deserve to be explored. Part Three will have the most interest for ufologists. This section contains the author's views on suspended animation, relativity effects, and extraterrestrial life. Although Nicolson believes that UFOs merit serious investigation, he sees rio evidence that we have ever been visited by aliens. However, we may be in the future! As a survey, this book belongs next to John Macvey's Interstellar Travel. Both touch upon a broad spectrum of topics in astronomy and engineering. Unfortunately, the net result is that one is left hungry for more.--Kim L.

Haines, Ph.D., will be released by the publisher Nelson-Hall, 111 North Canal St., Chicago, IL 60606 on March 10,1980. It is a guidebook for the professional investigator. The recent revival of the outer space science-fiction thriller in the motion picture industry and literature has sparked an increased awareness and interest in the UFO phenomenon across this country in the last few years. People are shedding skepticism and superstition in favor of documented research and recorded observations of seemingly unexplain- able encounters. While there has been a vast amount of literature written on the subject, it has almost exclusively concentrated on speculation about the nature of what has been observed, rather than on the nature of the observer. NASA research scientist Richard F. Haines believes that the status of UFOs would not be so confused if there were more trained observers to spot them, and competent investigators to gather testimony. His book, \"Observing UFOs,\" provides a unique guide to the scientific study of unidentified flying objects. Focusing on the observer, Haines explains the sensitive business of obtaining objective information from purported UFO witnesses. In a painstaking examination of relevant physiological and psychological data collected from past observers, Haines notes the common fallibilities of human perception. In addition to the subtle techniques of interviewing needed to draw out a reluctant witness or trip up a dishonest one, instructions on more sophisticated investigative methods, such as hypnosis and polygraph testing, are included. Haines also covers principles of surface reflections, angular sighting estimates and measurements, viewing very bright objects, and moving and stationary lights at night. Man's knowledge of the UFO phenomenon is still too incomplete to determine its causes. The immediate need is for more — and more reliable — data. This study, if widely and properly used, will go a long way toward consolidating the vast and growing literature on UFOs. The price is $21.95 for clothbound hardback and $10.95 for paperback. Dr. Haines was a featured speaker at MUFON's 1979 UFO Symposium in San Francisco. In a recent telephone conversa- tion, Bill Moore advised that his new book \"The Roswell Incident\" will not be released until June 1980 by Grosset and Dunn. As announced in the February 1980 issue of the Journal, Leonard Stringfield's new booklet titled \"The UFO Crash/Retrieval Syndrome,\" published by the Mutual UFO Network will be available March 1, 1980. (See notice in this issue.) It may be ordered from MUFON for $5.00 postage paid (air mail is extra). This has been the most exciting and intriguing disclosure to date on this closely guarded government secret. We are indebted to the people who provided confidential information to Leonard and hope that these disclosures will prompt others to come forward to share their information and experiences. Walter and Company, 720 Fifth Ave., New York, NY 10019 have announced the release of a new book on Feburary 28, 1980, titled \"Direct Encounters: Personal Histories of UFO Abductees\" by Judith and Allan Gansberg. Through in-depth interviews with the dozen abductees who have agreed to have their stories made public, the authors examine provocative and disturbing issues such as the media treatment of abductees, MUFON 103 OLDTOWNE RD. SEGUIN,TX 78155 the reactions of friends and neighbors, and the possibility of a government cover-up in the matter of UFOs. The selling price is $11.95. Your Director has not received an advance copy of the book, therefore we cannot comment on the contents. Lucius Parish will no doubt do so in his column \"Other's Words\" in a future Journal issue. In order to provide the readers of the Journal with the most current information on the UFO scene, the following news release is submitted; on June 20 and 21, the National UFO Conference will conduct its 17th annual event at the Doral Inn, at Lexington Avenue and 49th Street, New York City. The announced speakers are Stanton Friedman, Betty Hill, Art Ford, Philip J. Klass, Rick Hilberg, and Robert Easley. The two public sessions will be held on the afternoon and evening of Saturday, June 21. The cost of attending the two public sessions will be $10 each or both for $15. For further information please contact James W. Moseley, P.O. Box 163, Fort Lee, NJ 07024. With special convention rates at the Doral Inn at $49 for a single and $61 for a double per night, Journal readers will recognize the advantages of having a symposium away from the \"Big Apple.\" While the Bigfoot Information Center and Peter Byrne have closed shop and retired in Hood River, Oregon, another Bigfoot investigative group continues to gather information and to conduct field research in regard to the never-ending Bigfoot phenomenon. Project Bigfoot (formerly Project Greridel), Box 444-Northgate, Seattle, WA 98125 has two Bigfoot Hotlines (206) 622-0143 and (206) 522- 9381. Since some UFOlogists feel that there may be some connection between Bigfoot and UFOs, Project Bigfoot encourages these people to exchange information about any tall haircovered bipeds from any state.D 16"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"LIGHT-BENDING CASE By William C. Chalker (Note: This case is excerpted from a 10-page report titled \"The UFO Phenomenon — An Australian Perspective,\" 1976, UFO Investigation Centre, P.O. Box 6, Lane Cove N.S.W., Australia 2066). | Side view of BOURKES FLAT, VIC. APRIL 4. 1966 At Bourkes Flat, in Victoria, on April 4 (1966), Mr. Ron Sullivan had the bizarre experience of having his car headlights \"bent\" towards an unknown object shaped like an ice cream cone of colored light, and an asociated brilliant white disc. The headlight effect almost caused Mr. Sullivan to lose control of his car. A depression in sandy soil was found in a spot where the UFO appeared to be. The incident had a frightening aftermath. Two nights after Mr. Sullivan's experience, a young man was killed when his car swerved off the road \"for no apparent reason.\" The site of the accident was the same as the spot at which the UFO encounter . occurred.

Stringfield This 38-page monograph reports the author's startling findings since contacting additional witnesses to \"crashed saucers\" and preserved humanoid bodies. First-hand reports from eye-witnesses are cited, though most insisted on remaining anonymous. A medical doctor describes what he saw while examining one of the bodies. Four separate sources tell of seeing a movie film of a crashed saucer and humanoid bodies. Others describe being present at the crash scene. One apparently responsible businessman tells of secret computer data banks on UFO information. The impli- cations of the reports are staggering. If true, then the U.S. Government (and possibly others) has practiced a long-term deception that will shock the world when the truth emerges. Published by the Mutual UFO Network. Price: $5.00.

The late Wilbert B. Smith, Canada's best-known UFO researcher, obtained information in 1950 which led him to believe that \"the matter (of UFOs) is the most highly classified subject in the U.S. government, rating higher even than the H-bomb.\" This, according to an article by Bob Pratt in the February 12 issue of the Enquirer. The February 19 issue reports the case of a Brazilian woman who claims to have been cured of a fatal tropical disease by alien beings. The 1980 UFO ANNUAL from the publishers of UFO REPORT is largely composed of reprinted material from past issues of the magazine. Contributors include Larry E. Arnold, William L. Moore, Terence Dickinson, Wayne Laporte, and others. Again, mostly rehash in the #17 issue of TRUE UFOs & OUTER SPACE QUARTERLY. One fairly interesting article deals with reports of the \"Kickapoo Monster\" (a Bigfoot-like creature) in Illinois. Reader Tom Benson passes along a caveat emptor concerning the Rolling Thunder Press of New York City, which has recently published a booklet by Bernard O'Connor, HOW TO INVESTIGATE UFOs. It seems that the firm is also selling back issues of OFFICIAL UFO magazine for somewhat outrageous prices. If researchers are willing to pay anywhere from $3.00 to $10.00 per copy, that is their business, but be advised that the same issues can often be obtained from other sources for far less money. A new series of cassettes entitled \"Project Blue Book — Eyewitness Accounts of UFOs\" is currently available from Visual Education Corporation (Box 2321, Princeton, NJ 18 08540). Two of the three cassettes are largely composed of interviews with UFO witnesses, as recorded by Air Force UFO investigators. These accounts are from the Project Blue Book files, now in the National Archives. Cassette #1 has two reports from trained observers (Utah, 1961 and Florida, 1957) and a very interesting on- the-spot recording of UFO activity over Edwards Air Force Base, California, in 1965. Cassette #2 presents group observations of UFOs (Fort Smith, Arkansas, 1967 and Tillamook, Oregon, 1967), plus a recording of Charles Hickson telling of the 1973 experience he shared with Calvin Parker, as well as the Cisco Grove, California, case of a hunter who shot .arrows at \"robots\" from a UFO. Cassette #3 features John L. Acuff pf NICAP, giving the \"pro-UFO\" case, while skeptic Robert Sheaffer argues the \"anti-UFO\" position. This last cassette would have been far more interesting if it had contained more eyewitness reports, as neither Acuff 'nor Sheaffer contribute anything of substance. The three cassettes come in an attractive vinyl binder, with a \"Listener's Guide.\" The set is #5404K and the price is $34.00. A bit on the steep side, admittedly, but copies of the Air Force tapes from the National Archives would probably be even more expensive. Two recent hardcover books are OBSERVING UFOs by Dr. Richard F, Haines (Nelson-Hall Publishers; $21.95) and DIRECT ENCOUNTERS by Judith & Alan Gansberg (Walker & Co.; $10.95). March\" will see the publication of AN ACCOUNT OF A MEETING WITH INHABITANTS OF ' ANOTHER WORLD, 1871, by William Robert Loosley (St. Martin's Press; $7.95) and STONES FROM THE STARS by T.R. LeMaire (Prentice-Hall; $9.95). The LeMaire book is sub-titled \"The Unsolved Mysteries of Meteorites\" and the author proposes that some meteorites have been \"guided\" to Earth by extraterrestrials, based on their actions, velocities and fall patterns.
