By Dennis Stacy/Photographs by Ansen Scale R ichmond, Virginia, was sweltering in more ways than one. Flying up from San Antonio, I'd hoped I might find a weekend respite from the sum- mer heat, but as it turned out the East Coast was gripped by a heat wave of its own. No sweat, as the 1993 MU- FON Symposium proved to be a hot ticket, too, with more than 800 paid attendees passing through the crowded auditorium and contributing to a humid July Fourth holiday. The theme of the gathering, \"Ufology: The Emergence of a New Science.\" resulted in the largest published proceedings to date (304 pp.). Speakers included Budd Hopkins, George Knapp, John Schuessler, Linda Howe, John Mack, Cynthia Hind, Jeff Sainio, Colin Andrews (formerly of England), Illobrand von Ludwiger of Germany, Hoang-Yung Chiang of Taiwan, and Vincente-Juan Ballester Olmos of Spain, among others. Only an extensive paper by Jorge Martin of Puerto Rico arrived too late for inclu- sion. As usual, a casual get-together reception was held Friday evening in the Richmond Hyatt Hotel. The sym- posium proper began the next morning at 9 a.m. with welcoming remarks by Mark E. Blashak, Virginia State Director and Symposium Chairman, who introduced the Master of Ceremonies, Don Lovett, followed by greetings from MUFON's International Director Walter Andrus, Jr. AFRICAN ABDUCTIONS The first formal paper was delivered by Cynthia Hind of Harare, Zimbabwe, MUFON Continental Coordinator for Africa. Her talk, titled \"Abductions in Africa—Worldwide Similarities.\" was both informa- tive and humorous; several off-hand remarks aimed at herself had the audience rolling in laughter. At one point the comfortably rotund Ms. Hind wondered \"how come none of these creatures ever turn up in my bedroom?\" Cynthia urged that UFO and abduction researchers take into account cultural considerations in their inves- tigations, as she herself is in a most advantageous posi- tion to do. Her \"clients,\" so to speak, come from a vari- ety of cultural backgrounds, including tribal African, South African (European) and Islamic, some of which are ignorant of UFO abductions in general and even our own space sciences. \"Generally,\" Cynthia said, \"in southern and south-central Africa the masses of people are not aware of UFOs and their occupants. Their reac- tions are as perhaps those of Westerners confronting a ghost, not necessarily terrified, or not always so, but cer- tainly wary of what they see.\" One on-going case involved a young Islamic woman with two children. \"I would be in a dream-like state and I could feel people standing beside me and they would be touching me on the face or kissing my fore- head or be busy with my mouth. I'd be screaming, swearing, cursing and fighting, but no sound ever came out, neither could my limbs move. I became too scared to go to sleep and too frightened to remain awake. I left my bedroom light and radio on always.\" \"I was repeatedly raped. Although I could feel it, I never saw anyone. In desperation I went to some spiri- tualists who diagnosed my case as being involved with witchcraft and soon after, the raping did stop.\" IMPLICATIONS FOR THE FUTURE Dr. John E. Mack is a professor of psychiatry at the Cambridge Hospital, Harvard Medical School, and a new MUFON Director-at-Large in Psychiatry. His talk was \"The UFO Abduction Phenomenon: What Might It Mean for the Human Future?\" Dr. Mack is presently at work on a book about abductions, but readers who can't wait are advised to read his complete paper in the Proceedings. In brief, Mack was first introduced to the phenomenon via Budd Hopkins; over the last three years he has met with 71 people who fulfill his criteria of a genuine abduction case. Of these, more than 40 have been hypnotized from one to seven times. Aside from hypnosis. Mack also employs a form of breathing therapy, Holotropoic Breath work, acquired from Stanislav Grov, a Czech-born psychoanalyst. \"The brealhwork approach,\" Mack explained, \"uses deep, rapid breathing and evocative music to create a non-or- dinary state of consciousness that provides access to what Grof calls the holotropic or transpersonal world. In this state we are able to have experiences and perceive entities or beings that are not considered part of con- sensus reality. If stated in terms of the unconscious, this is like having Jungian ideas of the mythic or col- lective unconscious become real, experienced as actual in the world itself.\" Mack said that there are \"three classes of informa- tion involved in abduction phenomenology and some of this information cannot be apprehended within the epistemological and ontological structures that we have developed within the Western world-view. The phenomenon simply will not stay within the bound- aries of those structures. First are a class of relatively familiar phenomena that we believe we can study SEPTEMBER 1993 NUMBER 305 PAGE 3"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL empirically: these include things like UFOs and their photographs, missing time and persons, cuts, scars or scoop-marks, beams of blue light and so on. \"Second are things that seem sort of like technolo- gy, if you stretch its definition. These are capacities we can conceive of, but cannot now enact, although a hundred thousand years from now we might be able to. For example, people are taken through doors and walls, changed apparently into some sort of new ener- gy form that allows them to pass through solid objects. Finally, there is a whole other class of phe- nomena which we have no way to understand within the Western world-view. The aliens can appear, for example, in animal forms or UFOs can look like heli- copters. People have powerful past-life experiences. Many abductees experience themselves as having a double identity, both alien and human. \"My own view,\" said Mack, \"is that we have to take all of the phenomena, as they come, even if we have no place for them in our world view. I talked with Thomas Kuhn. who wrote the classic book. The Structure of Scientific Revolutions, about how scientif- ic paradigms change. He said, 'Just observe. Drop all your categories as best you can. Put them aside and just collect raw information. Don't worry about words like happening or didn't happen, exists or doesn't exist, inside and outside, real or unreal, internal or external. Put all that aside and just collect informa- tion.'\" For the abductees themselves, Mack identified both traumatic and transformational sequelae that take place over time. The first type of trauma is the abduction itself — being taken, powerless, against one's will. Trauma type two is a form of social isolation. \"Abductees are re- luctant to tell anybody about their experiences.\" Type three trauma is the reaction that \"this just can't be!\" The abduction experience simply shatters the individ- ual's previous assumptions about the nature of reality. \"The transformational aspect of the abduction phe- nomenon is more complex and includes a deep spiritual dimension: over time, many abductees experience the healing of many kinds of physical and emotional dis- tress. Sometimes an extraordinarily profound, powerful, loving relationship between the alien beings and the abductee occurs, and the experiencers may feel that the aliens have been their spirit guardians since birth if not through many centuries. The aliens may be experienced as intermediaries, beings that are closer to some kind of spiritual source, world soul or anima mundi.\" \"My overall impression is that the abduction phe- nomenon, which is occurring in the context of the growing threat to the earth's living systems, consti- tutes a joining of two (or more) species for some sort of evolutionary purpose ... It is possible that our sys- tematic destruction of the earth has not gone unno- ticed at a 'broader' or 'higher' level of intelligence and that these intrusions, as some abductees have said, represent some sort of correction, adjustment or evo- lution for all of the species involved.\" GERMAN ABDUCTIONS Illobrand von Ludwiger of Germany is the director for the Mutual UFO Network — Central European Section (MUFON — CES), a limited membership organization composed almost entirely of scientists and engineers, al- though public laypersons may be accepted for mem- bership beginning later this Fall or Winter. Von Ludwiger first reviewed the current status of UFO re- search in Germany, which is thinly-scattered and rarely addressed, except in contemptuous terms, by both the popular and scientific press and other media. However, a slight breakthrough in public relations may have oc- curred on May 23 of this year when a 45-minute docu- mentary on UFO abductions, by award-winning pro- ducer Christian Bauer, appeared on ZDF, the nation's second largest TV station. Several new abductees have since come forward to join the more than 20 cases al- ready under different degrees of investigation by MU- FON — CES. Seventeen of these cases are covered in detail in von Ludwiger's lengthy paper, along with the analyses of several photographs and at least one video. Of course there are some similarities between German abduction accounts and American ones, but there are some striking PAGE 4 NUMBER 305 SEPTEMBER 1993"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL differences, too. For one thing, German abductees on the whole seem much less inclined in general to undergo psychological analysis and regressive hypnosis than their American counterparts, although some of the latter has been undertaken. To stress the dissimilarities, one need look no further than the case of chemistry student Rolf Kaster, who was bicycling in the Ruhr district of Germany in late August or early September 1986, when he encountered a UFO and its occupants, and experienced a lengthy period of missing time which left him terribly tired. As the memories came rushing back, Kaster recalled seeing some sort of animal rising above the bushes alongside the bicycle path. He dismounted about 30 feet away; the figure turned out to be a giant female — 10 to 12 feet tall — dressed in a jumpsuit with a subdued metal sheen. She was very slender, with long limbs and a relatively small body and head. Von Ludwiger said the face was fair-skinned with European features that could even be called attractive. She spoke in a German dialect Kaster had difficulty understanding and said she was from the constellation Lupus, the same home as the notorious \"UMMO\" visitors. The female led him to a clearing where a cloud hov- ered a couple of hundred feet overhead, from which three small circular areas of rain fell. A long chain came down from the cloud, the giant hoisted Kaster on her shoulders and they were raised up into the interior of a craft about 300 feet in diameter. Inside were other skinny giants, both male and female, all nude. An aquarium on wheels rolled out, inside of which was a grayish-green creature that looked like three funnels placed one atop another with short tentacles underneath. Kaster felt like he was in telepathic communication with the \"funnel creature.\" Later, a helmet was placed on Kaster's head (he was told it was connected to a computer) and he was asked to play a sort of 3-dimensional checker game — an intel- ligence test? It also turned out that he could draw infor- mation from the computer. Kaster asked a number of technical questions to which he received answers, and which he hopes to patent. While regressive hypnosis is indicated, von Ludwiger indicated that Kaster would prefer to establish his credibility on the basis of his patents. He admitted that some aspects of his story were patently absurd, such as how he entered the UFO, but said ''Believe me, if 1 wanted to, I could invent a really good, interesting UFO story, full of thrills and excite- ment.\" INJURED DRIVER In the afternoon, John Schuessler, MUFON's Deputy Director for Administration, spoke about the Eddie Doyle Webb case. (His Proceedings paper was co-au- thored by attorney Edward F. O'Herin, who had aided John in the original investigation while the two were liv- ing in Missouri.) During the famous October 1973 UFO flap, Eddie Webb had been a truck driver based in Cape Girardeau. Missouri. He and his wife (she was just rous- ing from sleep) were driving on Interstate 55 at about 6:30 a.m.. when they encountered a literally blinding UFO. Webb first became aware of the UFO when he saw some unusual lights in his rear-view mirror. Looking over his shoulder, he could see thai they were attached to a silver, top-shaped object approaching the rear of his trailer: it appeared to be about 6 to 8 feet thick and ap- proximately 30 feet across. Webb barely had time for a good glimpse, before light and heat exploded in front of his face, temporarily blinding him and forcing him to pull the truck to a complete stop. What made the Webb case interesting was not only the physical traces involved (his glasses appear to have been partially melted) and the medical injuries, but be- cause it was one of the first times a \"UFO\" was subse- quently hauled into court, the latter occurring when Webb filed a workman's compensation claim with the Travelers Insurance Co. Travelers, not unexpectedly, argued that there was no objective evidence for the ex- istence of UFOs. The Referee overhearing the case al- lowed it to go forward to trial, but the case was ulti- mately settled out of court before that could happen, ap- parently because the insurance company did not want the embarrassing publicity of being associated with a UFO trial. SEPTEMBER 1993 NUMBER 305 PAGES"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL In 1992, two years after Webb died, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch revisited the case, concluding that the UFO part of his story was a hoax. What had \"really happened,\" the article said, was that Webb and his wife had gotten into an argument and she had thrust a lighted road flare in his face! \"It is important to learn from cases such as this one,\" said Schuessler, \"and to use that new knowledge to im- prove on all future cases. There are three key consider- ations. One, lawyers need to use the accumulated wealth of UFO data to establish precedent-setting cases, not al- lowing big insurance companies to win by settling out of court, or by denigrating the character of the victim just because he or she was involved with a UFO close en- counter. \"Secondly, medical data needs to be collected and uti- lized by caring medical professionals to help UFO vic- tims just as they would any other accident victims. Finally, trained investigators should not settle for tongue- in-cheek newspaper articles written by uncaring jour- nalists purely for shock value. Seldom are such arti- cles based on properly prepared evidence or scientific facts.\" SPANISH AIR FORCE FILES Vincente-Juan Ballester Olmos joined MUFON in 1974 as a research specialist in landing traces and in 1979 be- came MUFON's representative for Spain. Since 1984, he has been engaged in a diplomatic odyssey to induce the Spanish Air Force to declassify its UFO files. That project began bearing fruit in October of last year, when the Ministry of Defense began making such files avail- able at the Library of the Air General Headquarters in Madrid. Ironically, at about the same time that our own Air Force was getting out of the UFO business, the Spanish Air Force was just getting in, thanks to a local UFO flap in late 1968. On December 5, almost a year to the day before the American Air Force would announce the closure of Project Blue Book, the Spanish Air Ministry Press office sent a note to newspapers asking citizens to report UFO sightings to their nearest Air Force base or authority. On December 26, a confidential internal memo, Circular Number 9266-CT, was issued over the signature of General Luis Navarro, Chief, Air Force Staff, outlining the procedures subsequent investiga- tions would take. Periodically, the Air Ministry would issue a press release explaining this or that case as an astronomical or manmade event, as in the case of a widely-witnessed rocket launch from a French submarine in July of 1983. But in 1975, another wave of UFO sightings struck Spain. A year later, a journalist was given 12 case files from the Air Ministry's records; these were subsequently rushed into print in a sensational book which embar- rassed the military authorities by leaving the impression that it was an official statement. Olmos pointed out that such a reaction should not be seen as unusual, since Franco had just died and Spain was in a delicate transi- tion stage from authoritarianism towards democracy. But the damage was done; instead of making more of their UFO files publicly available, the Air Force and mil- itary retreated into its customary shell. In June of 1984, Olmos wrote the first of his many letters to the Minister of Defense, arguing that \"free access to administrative files of historical value is an as- set to any democracy.\" It took a year for a reply to arrive and by that time Spain had a new socialist government. Still, the Air Force declined, preferring to keep their UFO files classified. In 1988, Ballester Olmos was joined in his efforts to review the Spanish military cases by colleague Joan Plana. Two years later, said Olmos, \"in May of 1990,1 changed my strategy. From letter writing I moved to the close encounter approach. I made many visits to the Air Force General Headquarters Building in Madrid, meeting with the Public Relations Office, Air Safety Section, and others.\" After Olmos established his sincerity, the wheels of bureaucracy began slowly to turn. Eventually, steps were put in place whereby the Air Force agreed to re- lease 55 files, later changed to 66. Their last actual in- vestigation was said to have taken place in 1980, and in 1988 they supposedly stopped filing cases. \"It is pre- mature to disclose our findings at this point,\" said Olmos, \"so as not to jeopardize the progress under way. However, I would like to stress that the historical de- classification of the Spanish air military UFO archives has two distinctive features. First, it was inspired and in- stigated by the direct, silent and painstaking efforts of a member of the ufological community. Behind-the-scenes prudent but hard work, dialogue, correspondence and so forth with officers of the Air Force's Staff gave shape to a convincing process which was based on reasonable, logical, down-to-earth and non-egotistical grounds. The final achievement of the goal, of course, would not have been possible without the open-mindedness of the military and the Chief of the Air Force Staff. I don't see any reason why this approach cannot be successfully ap- plied to other countries as well.\" VIDEO ANALYSIS At the Albuquerque Symposium a year ago, MUFON photoanalyst Jeffrey Sainio predicted that the popularity of video camcorders would prove a boon to UFO pho- toanalysis. His prediction has already come true: the majority of UFO pictures now submitted for analysis are in video format. Video tape has considerable advan- tages and disadvantages over still, or negative, film, and these pluses and drawbacks were the subject of Sainio's presentation. Unfortunately, where print and pictures are concerned, a thousand words of the for- mer aren't necessarily worth one of the latter. To best ap- preciate Jeff's talk you had to be there in person to see PAGE 6 NUMBER 305 SEPTEMBER 1993"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL Left tii right: Vincentt'-JiKin Bullcsifr Olmos: H<inng-Yung Chiang: Ri>l]-Dietei Klein: IllohmnJ \\-<w Ludwiger: George Knapp and Linda M. Howe. the many video examples in color; to next best appreci- ate it. you should pick up a copy of the Proceedings, with its many black and white examples, as there was no videotaping of this year's speeches. The most obvious drawback is a lack of resolution: compared to print film, even the best home video looks \"grainy\" by comparison. On the other hand, video adds both a lime and audio dimension to the experience al- most totally absent from still photographs taken with 35mm cameras. In the same vein, while not impossible, a convincing UFO video hoax would be considerably more difficult to perpetrate than, say. a simple double- exposure on the still film side. Also, video tape can be copied fairly faithfully, whereas copies based on nega- tive film tend to lose clarity with each generation. Another advantage according to Sainio: you can do the duping at home and not have to worry about curious film counter clerks asking you embarrassing questions. But as with still-frame photography, there are a num- ber of actions the individual photographer can take to in- sure a maximum amount of data is preserved for future analysis. For one thing, said Sainio, \"keep talking. Describe what you're doing while you're filming with the zoom lens, what the object is doing, what colors you see with the naked eye, and so on. Try to include refer- ence points, be the latter streetlights or stars, and don't worry if something else intervenes in the frame. There's a tendency to try to get an unobstructed view of the UFO. but in fact more information about the object can be obtained if it is allowed to pass behind or in front of known reference points, such as tree branches and tele- phone lines.\" Most modern camcorders are autofocus, typically employing an infrared beam of light. Aiming the cam- corder up into the dark night sky only confuses the on- board computer chip and makes it zoom in and out as it tries to find the appropriate distance (and object) at which to focus. If possible, said Sainio, set autofocus at \"infinity\" and leave it there, \"unless the UFO shows up in the viewfinder as a bright overexposed dot.\" And, un- less your batteries are extremely weak, keep filming! Time considerations are extremely important in terms of the final analysis. While the latter can never absolutely establish or confirm that what was filmed was indeed a true UFO, it can conceivably eliminate any number of ordinary or mundane considerations, such as satellites, meteors and airplanes. But for this to happen, the pho- tographic record needs to be as complete and detailed as humanly possible. If you have the presence of mind, keep filming and talking, and put your camcorder through its paces. Zoom in and out, and run through the manual shutter exposure settings if your camera has them. Rotate your camera from horizontal to vertical so as to eliminate or identify any electronic artifacts occa- sioned when filming a bright object against a dark back- ground. If you don't have a tripod handy, steady the camera on something solid as best you can, for example, the roof of a car. SEPTEMBER 1993 NUMBER 305 PAGE 7"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL INSTRUMENTED DETECTION As we well know, photography (defined by the emis- sion and capture of excited photons) isn't the only way the UFO phenomenon can be detected, traced and ana- lyzed. Wesley Ellison, a MUFON staff specialist in in- strumentation, presented several alternative methods of detection and analysis. From this reviewer's perspective there were only two drawbacks: most of us do have a camera of some sort on hand or in the immediate vicin- ity, as opposed to the electronic devices Ellison pro- posed, and secondly, UFOs don't ordinarily wait around to be technically scrutinized in the field; the over- whelming number of UFO sightings are extremely fleet- ing (and unexpected) in duration. Flaps like the one in Gulf Breeze are rare. Film is a passive means of detection; the active means of detection preferred by Ellison would be something along the lines of Laser Imaging Radar, or LIDAR. a technology first developed for the military which is fil- tering down to the scientific community. A LIDAR sys- tem consists of a high-powered pulsed laser beam scanned in both the horizontal and vertical axis. When the beam strikes an object infrared light is reflected back to the source where it is scanned and analyzed by a computer, giving distance, speed and a real-time video image of the object. Ellison demonstrated a modestly- priced LIDAR he designed and assembled from sur- plus market electronics, but with a range of only 40 meters. A system with a range of five miles could be easily engineered as well, without too much in the way of additional costs. Commercial magnetometers, which detect the inten- sity and direction of magnetic fields, are still fairly ex- pensive, said Ellison, but the possible information that could be obtained might be worth the high cost. The reading could be converted into an analog signal by computer and compared with the signal of other known and unknown phenomena once a reliable database was established. Again, such instrumentation could best be employed in an area of repeat sightings. A cruder, but much less expensive form of magnetic field detection could be achieved by a fluxgate compass connected to an alarm circuit, a deviation in the existing magnetic field setting off the alarm. Attached to a stable platform, the same de- vice could also sound in the case of physical vibration. Another form of military trickle-down technology is the \"Night Vision Scope,\" which also employs infrared light in order to see heat sources at night. Coupled with a small Helium Neon laser which emits light in the red range, one could readily determine whether a phenomenon were a solid object or not. A similar sort of analysis could be carried out by means of a Starlight intensifier coupled to a laser. The former can amplify starlight on an order of 30 to 70 thousand times its intensity, unfortunately at a current cost of about $5000. Finally, there are both subsonic and ultrasonic sound detectors. Again, with the appropriate database or cata- log, UFO sounds could be compared with other known sounds. \"If UFOs are in our physical world, we can de- tect and analyze them,\" concluded Ellison. \"The tech- nology is now available to us, and it's time we put it to work.\" INVISIBILITY AND UFOs Saturday evening's keynote speech by Budd Hopkins was not an update of the Cortile Case, as some may have anticipated, but an examination of reported invis- ibility in association with UFOs. He did concentrate on a single case, however, that involving four mem- bers of a pseudonymous Australian family, Sam and Jenny \"Washburn\" and their two sons. Hopkins came across the case in the Fall of 1992 while on a lecture tour in Australia. In Brisbane, he was approached in person by Sam and Jenny who told him that five days prior they and one of their sons, now 20, had all suf- fered nosebleeds from the same nostril. \"For most of his 42 years,\" said Hopkins, \"Sam has suffered from events which suggested classic abduc- tion experiences. He was filled with a recurring and nearly unbearable fear which had begun in childhood when he lived on a farm.\" One 14-year-old event in particular stood out, although at first Hopkins couldn't make the connection. Jenny handed Budd four red- tinted photographs and asked him if he had ever seen anything like them. Aside from their red tinge, they were unremarkable; they showed trees on a beach and an empty expanse of sand, but little else. \"The thing about these pictures,\" explained Jenny, \"is that we're supposed to be in them, and we're not.\" On the day in question, Sam and Jenny had taken their two children to the beach in the pictures, a favorite playground called the esplanade, in Wynnum, near Greater Brisbane. Everyone felt uneasy about the visit, and in fact the family never returned to the esplanade. \"I felt lost,\" said Sam. \"Everything seemed in slow motion. I felt like I wasn't there.\" Under hypnosis, Jenny revealed a standard UFO abduction. Sam had the camera and she was posing with the two boys, when she felt \"something big up over us,\" and then the sensation of rising into the air. She could see Sam standing on the beach, camera still raised to his face. Inside, they were approached by small figures. The boys were taken away, and Jenny was subjected to gynecological procedures. Later, all three descended in a brilliant beam of light. Sam was still in the same position, after what felt like an hour. Under hypnosis, Sam himself remembered seeing two small silver balls about the size of a softball hovering about the beach. Jenny and the boys start to rise in the air and disappear inside an area of bril- liance described as \"bigger, much bigger\" than a car. Sam remembers encountering the smaller balls in his PAGES NUMBER 305 SEPTEMBER 1993"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL early childhood. \"They belong to that other thing,\" he said. \"Don't ask me about the physics behind it,\" said Hopkins, \"but apparently for the better part of an hour all four members of the Washburn family, along with the abducting UFO, were rendered invisible to every- one else on the beach. The only conclusion I can draw from this remarkable event, and the four photographs, is that another 'impossible' aspect of the UFO abduc- tion phenomenon has now forced itself into the canon of the possible.\" UFOs OVER CHINA Sunday morning's first talk was delivered by Hoang- Yung Chiang of Taipei, Taiwan, and concerned the sta- tus of UFO research and reports in mainland China. Mr. Chiang is chairman of the UFO Research Association of Taiwan, a MUFON Consultant in Biotechnology and our Foreign Representative in Taiwan. Although the present methodology employed by Chinese ufologists is not up to Western standards, Mr. Chiang said that some progress is in sight. In the last 20 years or so, some 7500 UFO cases have been collected and catalogued, 1500 of which date back to historical times. As expected with such a large population, China has a few records of its own. On July 24, 1981, for ex- ample, a spiral-shaped UFO was witnessed by as many as a million people, although only a single set of pho- tographs of the event has surfaced to date. The Journal of UFO Research, a Chinese newsstand magazine, rou- tinely sells 350,000 copies monthly. Reports of at least two rumored UFO crashes and an abduction or two are currently under investigation by Mr. Chiang and his mainland colleagues. PUERTO RICO Apparently there has been a good deal of UFO ac- tivity over the island of Puerto Rico in recent years, according to Jorge Martin, editor of Enigma and the local MUFON State Director. Unfortunately, Mr. Martin's lengthy paper arrived too late for inclusion in the Proceedings. I was unable to attend his talk as 1 was in the Board of Directors meeting; however, I un- derstand that Mr. Martin had several striking UFO pho- tographs from the recent flap. Members who weren't able to attend in person can probably read much of the same material in an article Mr. Martin contributed to Timothy Good's latest collection of essays, Alien Update. CROP CIRCLES I was also unable to attend Colin Andrews's crop circle update, although judging from his published paper in the Proceedings, it was heavily illustrated with slides of last year's circles and drew on some 200 eyewitness re- ports in the computerized files of his organization. Circles Phenomenon Research International, now based in Brandford, Connecticut. It goes without saying that human hoaxing and other activities have greatly complicated the crop circle picture in recent years. For example, the so-called Silbury \"necklace\" formation pictured in Colin's paper on page 171 and again on page 180 of the Proceedings forms the centerpiece confession of Jim Schnabel's recently pub- lished Round in Circles. One of Mr. Andrews's histori- cal cases—that of William Loosey on October 4,1871 — is also a well-known hoax, perpetrated by English physi- cist \"David Langford\" a few years back in a book titled, if memory serves, An Account of an Encounter With Denizens of Another World, which pretended to be an original Victorian manuscript. Langford has publicly admitted as much, and even successfully sued American author Whitley Strieber when his creative property turned up. uncredited, in the latter's novel, Majestic. AREA 51 Another matter of some controversy surrounds the claims of physicist Bob Lazar, who says he was hired to help reverse engineer a flying saucer propulsion system at Area S-4, south of Area 51, or Dreamland. And who better lo address the topic, \"Area 51, Bob Lazar and Disinformation—A Re-evaluation,\" than TV reporter and producer George Knapp? After all. it was Knapp who first brought Lazar to widespread attention in 1989, when he anchored the news on KLAS-TV, Las Vegas, the local CBS affiliate. Knapp left KLAS in 1991 to ac- cept a position as Senior Vice-President with the Altamira Communications Group. In March of this year, he traveled to the former Soviet Union, hoping to unlock the KGB's UFO files. So many wild rumors surround Lazar personally and Dreamland in general, said Knapp, that he has given up trying to keep track of them. \"By the same token, stories of UFOs at Area 51 didn't begin with Lazar, and they don't end with him. \"Members of the Groom family, for instance, for whom the mountains are named and who lived in the region for most of this century, say the story of alien craft at Area 51 dates back to the 1950s and was common knowledge among their neighbors in Lincoln County.\" In fact, Lazar is but the most notorious—because the most public—witness to weird goings-on at Dreamland and environs. Many more are mentioned in Knapp's paper by name; because it's so atypical, we'll consider here only the case of Dr. Dan Crain, \"a promi- nent biologist who worked with the Las Vegas Planetarium Society, the Young Astronaut Program, and was a frequent lecturer at Southern Nevada's community college.\" Knapp said he began receiving unsolicited letters from co-workers and ex-girlfriends of Grain's, all implying that he was involved with alien research. \"When confronted with this information, Crain freaked. He agreed to meet with me and to hand over copies of SEPTEMBER 1993 NUMBER 305 PAGE 9"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL \"Too many people, living in too many places, over too many years are telling us the same thing.

But he never showed up. In fact, he dropped out of all of his civic as- sociations and disappeared. I've learned that he is now working at a Las Vegas hotel as a security guard, which is a strange career move for a biologist.\" Are the stories told by Grain and the others merely an attempt to disguise black budget projects underway at Area 51? \"This pattern of testimony simply doesn't fit our concept of a disinformation campaign,\" said Knapp. ''Too many people, living in too many places, over too many years are telling us the same thing. For anyone to 'plant' all this information, for whatever purpose, simply doesn't add up.\" What about Bob Lazar? \"Criticisms of Lazar's story are many, and many are deserved.\" Knapp admitted. \"He is lackadaisical about documentation, indifferent to whether anyone believes him, uncooperative (especially with anyone associated with ufology), and seemingly has little interest in helping anyone to prove his story. There are many gaps, many things that don't make sense, but too much of what he does say does make sense to merely dismiss it.\" Ideally. Knapp would like to see the same sort of cooperative effort go into Area 51 research as has been concentrated on. say, the Roswell incident. \"We need to work together on this, cut out some of the infighting and rivalries, and find out what's really going on.\" ALABAMA MUTILATIONS Beginning in October of 1992 and culminating in March of this year, a series of 32 cattle cuttings occurred near Fyffe and Albertville, in northeastern Alabama, reported Linda Moulton Howe, the author of An Alien Harvest. In her slide and video-illustrated talk Ms. Howe also noted reports of helicopters flying in extremely inclement wealher, chopper sounds heard in a clear sky, and at least two reports of large disk-shaped objects. In addition, a university laboratory confirmed that the substance found on one dead cow's face was an unidentified inorganic compound. Denver pathologist and hematologist Dr. John Altshuler also confirmed that another cow's udder had been cut with a sharp instrument; six tissue samples from another calf had been cut with high heat. A press conference held by the Fyffe. Alabama Police depart- ment on April 7, 1993. was attended by approximately 45 reporters from three states. CNN also provided cov- erage of the mutilations. Aside from her Proceedings pa- per, Ms. Howe is also at work on a new book, to be ti- tled Glimpses of Other Realities. Next year's MUFON Symposium promises more heat and Southern hospitality.

By Sean Casteel I n the summer of 1990, after nearly three years of both public and private struggle with the media, the UFO community, and what he called \"The Visitors,\" Whitley Strieber announced the closing down of The Communion Foundation and withdrew completely from the public discussion of UFOs and his own abduction experiences. The year before, it was rumoured that he was barred from the set of his own movie based on Communion, and there were other reported incidents of public anger as well. What was bugging Whitley Strieber? Was the abduction experience itself driving him over the edge? Back then, Strieber often said that he very much wanted to arrive at an understanding of the abduction ex- perience that viewed the business in a positive light. When he spoke to me in a recent phone interview, he said, \"Well, I had to, because if I hadn't thought that in the beginning. I certainly would have blown my brains out. There's no question about that at all. And if I had not made myself find something about my experiences that could be made into a positive thing, I couldn't have lived. It would have meant that I was living in hell, and there was no escape from it.\" Strieber said there was no way to simply stop the ex- perience, no magic button to turn it off with. And the UFO researchers were no help. \"The social structure that surrounds it,\" Strieber said, \"by which I mean the UFO community, insure that the people in it will never get the advantage of having le- gitimate science look into it and see what's really hap- pening. Meaning that it's, in effect, incurable. And to- tally misunderstood.\" Strieber claimed that the prejudice surrounding the subject is intolerable. \"Having had this experience,\" Strieber said, \"and declared yourself as having had it means that you will spend the rest of your life being discriminated against just like a black in the South in 1925. I am just as dis- criminated against. My civil rights and my personal rights are as consistently abused as if I didn't have them. I'm treated like a madman was treated in the 18th century, or like a disenfranchised individual in the 19th or 20th century. \"My son, for example,\" Strieber continued, \"was so discriminated against in the school he went to by the teachers and the administration, even though he's an honor student, that we finally had to move him to an- other school where they don't realize who I am. The dis- crimination I experience is really just across the board. From the literary community, where I used to be a mem- ber—now I'm not even welcome at the meetings. My life has been threatened half a dozen times since I wrote Communion. My family has been threatened. Things have been sabatoged. Oil was poured down our wells up in our little country house. \"We had to finally move from our cabin to another house because the cabin had become the focus of things like — we'd wake up in the morning and find a man just standing out in the road with a rifle in his hands. Not do- ing anything but just standing out there. That kind of threat was constant. But appeals I've made to writer's organizations have gone completely unanswered. No one cares. 1 will say that when there's been police in- volvement, it's all been very professional.\" N ot only does Strieber feel like an outsider from the so-called \"straight world\" of non-believers, he also feels very much set apart from the UFO community, much to his own displeasure. \"I think that if I wasn't such an enemy of that community,\" Strieber said, \"in such an adversary relationship with that community, so afflicted by so much lying and so much confusion, my experiences could be very useful in illuminating the problem. What I actually have done with Communion is I have elevated and increased people's ability to handle this experience tremendously all over the world. You should see some of the thousands and thousands of let- ters we get. Nearly a thousand letters a month from people who have been enriched by the book and whose encounter experiences are richer because of what they read in that book. The rest of the UFO community has never accomplished anything like that. And I feel that I should be treated with, first of all, more respect, and sec- ond, taken more seriously by the community. Instead of playing those stupid mind-games they played with me. I think it's awful, just awful. The community must learn to respond to me in a more meaningful and sensible way as a group. \"I don't expect a continuity of reaction,\" Strieber went on. \"There should be a lot of diversity. But it shouldn't be based on lies, innuendo, rumors, and in many cases, purposely incorrect misinterpretations of what I say. Most specifically to characterize it as black or white. \"Whitley Strieber believes the aliens are good, and Budd Hopkins believes they're evil.' \"That kind of thing is so moronic. Both of us are struggling with this and having a tremendous amount of difficulty in different ways. We don't have the same take on it. But he's struggling just as much as I am.

To try to make it into something black or white and to divide people according to this false black or white issue about whether the so-called aliens are good or bad is to fail even to begin to see what's going on.\" S trieber said he was only recently recovering from a long and deep depression that had lasted from mid- 1989 to the middle of last year. \"I was so deeply depressed.\" he said, \"that nothing, no drug that the psychiatrist tried on me, nothing would get me out of it. I was almost inert. Then I had a Visitor en- counter, which was as usual unspeakably terrifying. You know, encountering them in a slightly dreamlike state for three seconds or three minutes is bad enough. But when you are face to face with them alone and it's not a dream and you're wide awake and you're wearing your clothes and you see them the way they really look, you cannot imagine how terrible it is. \"I've come away from this experience convinced of one thing: if there aren't demons out there, there might as well be. Because these guys are indistinguishable from demons. Indistinguishable. To see them, to look into their eyes, is to be less. Forever. It hurts you, it takes from you, forever. Because then you know that that ex- ists. And that makes you less.\" Strieber does admit that the experiences of Betty Luca of The Andreasson Affair and The Watchers still leave the door open for hope. \"The number of us who are so spiritually superb as Betty Luca,\" Strieber said, \"who can really make this en- counter experience fly, is tiny. That's why Betty was such an inspiration to me. When I was at the depths of my depression, one of the things I did was read Betty's interviews and listen to her tapes, just to hear the sound of her voice when she was talking. I would look at the drawings she sent me. And it helped me a lot. Betty's ex- periences are the thing you grab onto when you're sink- ing.\" Strieber has recently released his latest horror novel, an imaginative chase novel called The Forbidden Zone that seems ready made for movie special effects and has the great villain speaking those immortal words first spoken by the Visitors in Communion, \"We have the right to do this.\" He has recently finished the screen play for last year's Unholy Fire, which will be directed by George Romero.

By T. David Spencer W hen I first took over the excellent work of Dan Wright and Forest Crawford to initiate an elec- tronic database for MUFON's case reports, I was a bit naive regarding the amount of work required to catch up with the past case reports. Still, progress is being made, and I have additionally been keeping current with the cases received from Jerold R. Johnson, our Deputy Director of Investigations. Starting with 145, the quantity of reports in the database is now pushing 300. Although there are many more past cases to be included than have been entered, the amount of entered data thus far allows a limited number of obser- vations which are thought to be of interest, and I will try to provide these in installments over time. SIGHTING LOCATIONS When Siskel and .Ebert, a popular movie critic team on television, reviewed \"Fire in the Sky,\" I noted their comment that UFO incidents always seem to happen to people in the countryside, not to city folk. As illustrated in the first pie chart, more than half (55%) of our reports are sightings in or near towns and cities. But further examination of the data reveals that the number of \"close encounter\" incidents — that is, within 500 feet or less from the witness — in cities, towns, and suburbs (74 cases) is notably more than those in \"rural\" areas (52 cases). As I have sorted the data, \"rural\" means \"not designated as within city. Percent by Site Data as of August 6, 1993 Suburb (28.4%) Town (12.5%) City (14.0%) Rural (45.0%) town, or suburb,\" and includes sea, lake, wood, prairie, farmland, mountain, and tundra. The only type of sighting in our database which has a greater number in rural areas is the \"anomaly.\" In the database, an anomaly is a ghostly light, \"angel hair,\" indications of a landing site, or one of any number of different peculiarities which the witness and the inves- tigator both believe could be related to UFOs even though a UFO object has not been seen. A total of 21 anomalous events are recorded in the database, 16 of which were witnessed in rural areas. We cannot claim that the quantities of reports we get from each area represent the proportions of obser- Classification Data As of Augusts, 1993 AN1 AN2 CE1 CE2 CE3 CE4 FB1 FB2 FB5 MA1 MA2 SEPTEMBER 1993 NUMBER 305 PAGE 13"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL vations by area, but the UFO report data suggests the possibility that the UFO phenomena—whether or not observed or reported—may occur equally as often in cities, towns, and suburbs as in rural areas. CLASSIFICATIONS When the improvements to classifications proposed by Johnson in his article \"Widening the Net\" (MUFON UFO Journal, March 1993) are included in the database, the results are as illustrated in the \"Classification Data\" chart. The category types are AN (for \"anomaly\"), CE (for \"close encounter\"), FB (for \"fly-by\") and MA (for \"maneuver\"). The FB and MA types represent \"distant encounters,\" and they constitute 45.8% of the current database. Johnson gave a detailed description of each category in his article. The proportion of incidents by category type is: • AN (anomaly)-7.7%. • CE (close encounter) = 46.5%. • FB (fly-by) = 17.3%. • MA (maneuver) = 28.5%. A lthough it has long been assumed that distant encounters like FB and MA represent the major- ity of sightings, the number of fly-by and manuever reports (124) vs. the number of CE (close encounter) reports (126) does not support this supposition. What does this mean? While we could conclude that there are equal numbers of observations of fly-bys and maneuvers collectively, when compared with close encounters, it's also likely that we've been care- ful not to include cases which could be the result of natural or man-made phenomena, such as bolides, stars, planets, satellites, supersonic aircraft, etc. If this is true, it helps assure that the database is conserva- tive, as I think it should be. On the other hand, the finding may simply mean that a lot of cases are not interesting enough for investigators to devote their energy to them, a thorough report normally requiring many hours of the investigator's time to complete. It would be unfortunate to receive significantly fewer reports than known events, but if it means we get more or better reports of complex (and more interest- ing) cases, so much the better. The MUFON processing of a report provides sever- al formal reviews (by the corresponding State Section Director, State Director, Regional Director, and the Deputy Director of Investigations) before it is entered into the database. This means the entered report should be of fairly high caliber. For my money, I would rather have a small quantity of good reports than a large number of poor or highly questionable ones. Good statistics cannot be obtained from garbage information and it is very difficult to weed out bad data after the fact. Percent by Type Data as of August 6, 1993 AN (7.7%)-y FB(17.3%) MA (28.4%) CE (46.5%) From the \"Classification Data\" chart, it is readily apparent that the majority of reports are identified (subclassified) with a \"I\" (AN1, CEl, FBI, and MAI). As illustrated in Johnson's article, a \"1\" represents a simple sighting; a \"2\" indicates there are physical effects or evidence associated with the sighting; a \"3\" represents cases in which live entities are observed; a \"4\" regards interaction with entities (such as CE-4 abductions), and a \"5\" identifies events resulting in lasting injury or death. For example, an AN3 category (an anomaly involving the observation of entities) could relate to a ghostly apparition, an FB3 or MA3 indicates the observer saw entities onboard a distant UFO, and a CE3 represents an encounter within five- hundred feet of the witness in which beings were involved but no abduction or injury occurred. The \"1\" identifier accounts for 87.5% of the data- base (237 records), while a \"2\" was given to 7.7% of the reports, a \"3\" to 2.2%, a \"4\" to 2.2%, and a \"5\" to 0.4% (one occurrence).

DC — On July 5. the Monday following the Richmond MUFON Symposium, more than 50 supporters of Operation Right to Know marched in front of the Clinton White House carrying banners that said \"UFOs are real and the government knows it.\" The demonstration was the second consecutive one mounted in the nation's capital by ORTK and fol- lowed an earlier protest outside the offices of the Washington Post. Subsequent walks were scheduled for Grand Rapids, Ml. on August 14 and Long Island, NY, on the 21st. \"Ridicule was not a problem,\" said Ed Komarek, co-founder with Mike Jamieson of ORTK. \"The Spirit of the marchers was high and the extent of media coverage was outstanding.\" (See photo below.) The Associated Press picked up the story, as did Ted Turner's Cable News Network (CNN).

Coddington ¥ ames Pontolillo was most recently book review ed- I itor and contributing author for The INFO Journal. I the membership organ of the International Fortean -^organization, a small but dedicated group bent on \"...furthering the work of [the latej Charles Fort in dis- covering, enjoying, exploring and publicizing phenom- ena that appear to contradict the laws of nature.\" Fort's legacy lies in his books, lightly impudent compendia of reported strange and seemingly impossible occurrences he gleaned largely from newspapers worldwide around the turn of the century. A redeeming characteristic of most Forteans is a re- fusal to take themselves seriously. As did Fort himself, they find reported anomalies fascinating and sometimes amusing but perhaps from fear that fascination may breed gullibility they lean strongly to disbelief in those reports. The annual Fortfest meeting is a funfest rife with fanciful speculation about such improbabilities as sea monsters, fish or other strange objects falling from the skies, spontaneous human combustion...and yes, UFOs and their alleged victims. Yet there also is a serious in- terest in determining if there are germs of truth under- lying such improbabilities. It's clear in Demons, Doctors and Aliens that Pontolillo is serious. It's also clear early on that he gives no credence to the alleged reality of UFO abduc- tions, reports of which he asserts are exclusive to the West, arise solely from psychological \"screen\" memories or hypnotically induced pseudomemories and confabu- lations, and are fueled by irresponsible popularization of such claims in the media. (Cynthia Hind, for one, would be surprised, having accumulated reports of abductions in South Africa — conscious-memory reports made by natives with zero exposure to popular western media.) His conclusions are aptly summarized in an ad for this \"Occasional Paper\" in the February 1993 INFO Journal: \"There is not a shred of evidence for alien abductions. The abductee 'testimony' is a modem version of the same ignorance, bigotry, fantasy and sexual neuroti- cism that resulted in the witch trials and burnings. The experiences are the same, the 'evidence' is the same, and the sexuality is the same — even the questions and an- swers are the same.\" Pontolillo brings to this brief paper considerable eru- dition and extensive research. Its reference bibliography lists over 120 sources! But one's erudition and scholar- ship don't guarantee immunity to subjectively tainted conclusions. To reach his, Pontolillo briefly reviews the evolution of classical myth and folklore from ancient Sumerian legends telling of \"...godlike entities from other star systems coming down to interbreed\" with humans, to Genesis' familiar \"sons of God\" mating with daughters of men, to myths of \"wee people\" and fairy-human interbreeding, to the demonic connotation given by the early Church to supposed nonhuman in- terlopers. He sees in the heavily sexual/gynecological content of today's UFO abduction reports nothing more substantive than a modern expression of a quirk uni- versally inherent to the human psyche that has spawned legendary tales of couplings, consensual or forced, of mortals with nonhuman entities down through history. To this point his postulate may be tenable. Perhaps there indeed is an archetypical aspect of Jung's collective unconscious giving rise to an underlying commonality among perceptual but unreal abduction experiences in both folklore and the present. Presuming the historical lore to be nothing more than imaginary, delusional and fictional, it follows for Pontolillo that today's reports, arising as he asserts from the same dark recesses of the universal human psyche, are equally delusional and fic- titious. O f course, this presumption-based conclusion automatically discourages examination of alter- nate possibilities, however remote. For one: Pontolillo notwithstanding, we cannot say with certainty there is not some underlying ageless and real nonhuman agency buried in the welter of folklore common to all cultures; perhaps even one capable of inducing incred- ible misperceptions (such as \"abduction-oriented sub- version myths\"), for inconceivable motives, in the minds of human victims. To extrapolate his premise more specifically, Pontolillo imparts an added spin to his postulated psy- chological profile by couching our continuing history of abduction myths in a context of misogyny. Perhaps some will be startled by his fervent assertion that \"The unifying thematic element and raison d'etre of all ab- duction cycle phenomena, whether of the angelic, de- monic, elfin, human (white slavery) or extraterrestrial variety, is a pathological hatred, contempt and fear of Woman as a self-defined individual.\" To exemplify this purported pathological hatred at work, Pontolillo dwells in some depth and graphic detail on the most sordid gynecological aspects of the perse- cution and torture, by Church, state and society, of ac- cused female witches from the fifteenth century to the notorious Salem witch trials. These, he contends, were a particularly onerous derivative of his postulated ''misog- ynistic myth\" and were the precursor of today's obses- PAGE 16 NUMBER 305 SEPTEMBER 1993"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL With this the author would drag the already contro- versial UFO subject Into the rancorous socle-moral schism over abortion that Is troubling our society today. sion with UFO abduction lore. However, as his own discourse confirms, the inquisition, torture and even deaths of the accused witches were perpetrated by hu- man tormentors, more or less publicly, mainly for the witches' suspected crime of presumably consensual in- tercourse with nonhuman (and therefore demonic) enti- ties. For most readers it will be a far stretch to view this as socio-psychologically or culturally equivalent to to- day's reported covert abductions and physiological vio- lations of unwilling victims by nonhuman entities. To fit his anti-woman-culture thesis to modern ac- counts, Pontolillo insists that \"...the majority of those who have claimed to have undergone an abduction by aliens are women.\" He adds, \"...[though] no reliable statistics have been compiled... a survey of the litera- ture. ..warrants] this conclusion.\" Is this accurate? Lacking detailed statistics from Hopkins, Fiore, Jacobs, Mack, et al, it's interesting to look first at those reported abductions that have gained broad notoriety over the years: Betty and Barney Hill, Betty Andreasson-Luca, Charles Hickson and Calvin Parker, Antonio Villas-Boas, Travis Walton, Herb Schirmer, Whitley Strieber, and most recently Hopkins's \"Kathie Davis\" and \"Linda Cortile.\" Here we find men have the edge by seven to four. Thumbing next through several popular books on the subject for a cursory view of gender balance among abductees in the literature, one finds that Budd Hopkins's Missing Time, besides mentioning several of the noted abductees above, discusses at varying lengths alleged abductions of eleven males and seven females; Edith Fiore's Encounters discusses seven females and six males; and in Appendix B of Secret Life David Jacobs names 22 females and 17 males — female pre- ponderant by only 54%. Overall, this literature scarcely is overwhelmingly gender-slanted toward women, at least in numbers, as Pontolillo implies. T o further support this alleged gender prevalence, Pontolillo asserts: \"The amount of time and effort devoted to documenting abductee claims also falls dis- proportionately towards those accounts given by Women.\" Checking this, we find that Missing Time de- votes on the order of just over 50 pages to details of ab- ductions of females, but over 100 pages to those of ab- ducted males. Encounters averages just over 16 pages for each female, but nearly 18 pages per male. In Secret Life one female abductee's extended experiences reach a cumulative 31 pages; apart from this exception, Jacobs averaged about six-and-a-half pages each to other fe- males' accounts, and five each to those for males. These, too, fall short of immoderate bias toward women. Pressing his premise still further, Pontolillo says of the Hills' bellwether abduction case: \"...Betty's re- membrances generated an inordinate amount of interest while those of her husband were only mentioned as an afterthought.\" It's true that Betty's account is the more richly detailed one, but it's inaccurate to say Barney Hill's was shortchanged. John Fuller's The Interrupted Journey, the definitive treatment of the scenario re- vealed by the Hills' respective hypnosis sessions, con- tains a nominal 60 pages of literal dialog between Betty and psychiatrist Benjamin Simon, but devotes over a hundred pages to Barney's dialog. Scarcely just a pass- ing afterthought! (In a blanket assault on the professionalism of all hypnotists involved, Pontolillo says, \"A casual exami- nation of all major pro-abduction books reveals the use of leading questions by researchers on their hypnotized subjects. \"Fact: Dr. Simon, a consummate professional psychiatrist, at no time attributed any validity to the Hills' accounts, and certainly didn't lead them. Their ab- duction scenario emerged, nevertheless.) Since any objective reality behind reported abductions still falls short of scientifically acceptable proof, a rea- soned and logical argument against their reality can be formulated. Others have made cogent arguments for abduction scenarios being only psychological creations with no objective reality. However, the dissimilarity in essentials between humans' persecution of witches and alien abductions, coupled with the failure of the leading abduction literature to support Pontolillo's assertions of a nearly exclusive focus on and victimization of women, mitigates against his more damning conclu- sion that abduction reports represent a pernicious, misog- ynistic perversion of our cultural milieu. It appears Pontolillo's reasoning is colored by a strongly subjective agenda. The real focus of that agenda is revealed and underlined by his concluding statement in Demons: \"...in the United States, the message of the alien abduction phenomenon could not be more clear: women cannot have control over their own bodies, either in this world or an imaginary one [Pontolillo's empha- sis].\" With this he would drag the already controversial UFO subject into the rancorous socio-moral schism over abortion that is troubling our society today. It will be interesting to see how successfully he can enlist sup- port for this contentious view. * * * For reasons not made public, release of Demons, Doctors and Aliens as an International Fortean organi- zation occasional Paper triggered marked dissent among the INFO Board of Directors after the fact. Differences were of a magnitude to provoke the resig- nations of several individuals, including Pontolillo. Perhaps the root of the controversy will come to light in due course. SEPTEMBER 1993 NUMBER 305 PAGE 17"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL TEN UFOs DRAWN IN AUTOCAD By Donald Mann &>. Erich Aggen Self-published, 41 pages, $12 Reviewed by Dennis Stacy Desktop publishing, consisting of an Apple Macintosh or IBM-compatible computer and the appropriate soft- ware, coupled with a laser printer or service bureau output, continues to be a boon to graphic artists and writers interested in the UFO phenomenon who might not otherwise find a professional name outlet for their work. In some cases, it can be a boon (or a burden) to the consummate student, too. Ten UFOs lies somewhere along that sliding scale, depending on your own particular personal interest in the phenomenon. The original idea was certainly an ambitious one: take some of the best UFO pho- tographs available and convert them into the sort of \"blueprint\" diagram afforded by AutoCAD — Automatic Computer-Aided-Design — software. Once an object is reduced to its basic diagram or out- line, it can be rotated and viewed from any angle at will, giving a 3-dimensional \"reality\" to apparently solid objects not normally captured in photographs, which confine the phenomenon to the two dimensions of height and width. For the most part this vision has been realized. MUFON State Section Director Erich Aggen, Jr. of Kansas City, Missouri, supplied the original pho- tographs and, presumably, the accompanying text. Graphic artist Donald Mann then undertook the painstaking task of converting these photographs into detailed plans allegedly accurate to a thousandth of an inch. The author(s) warn that the UFOs so treated are not necessarily authentic: \"Using AutoCAD the draw- ings have exact dimensions whether or not the UFOs depicted in the photographs are accurate representa- tions of actual alien spacecraft. \" [My emphasis.] Thus the UFOs so detailed range from the reliable (the McMinnville, Oregon, photograph) to the highly dubious (George Adamski and Billy Meier). Other UFOs so treated include the Stock, Trindade. UMMO. Gulf Breeze and Barra da Tijuca UFOs. Meier's so- called \"Pleiadian Beamships\" account for three of the cases. Despite the fact that only ten UFOs are referred to, some 27 detailed drawings are reproduced (almost three a case). The accompanying text, while brief and to the point, could still have used more qualification in terms of which cases are considered reliable by main- stream ufology and which ones aren't, or at least remain under a cloud of suspicion. The fear here is that, once disseminated, these drawings will all be accepted by the general public as the \"real thing.\" Cautious students, however, will find much here to study. In terms of pure paper alone (41 pages) — if not necessarily man hours — Ten UFOs seems a wee bit over-priced at $14 ($12 plus $2 postage). In addition, the quality of the printed text isn't quite on a par with that of the reproduced diagrams. But the latter are certainly superb. In fact, we've reproduced one above. Anyone who hungers for more of the same will find their ap- petite satiated. It occurs to me that the authors of this work could probably also make their material available on floppy disks (in the form of TIP, GIF or PCX graphic files) for about roughly the same price. Then almost anyone with a computer could avail themselves of same, reproduction fees included. Ten UFOs can be ordered directly from Donald Mann, Drawer A, 130 S. Terrace, Liberty, MO 64068.

JULY KUDOS Kudos to Dennis Stacy for putting together an excellent issue of MUFON UFO Journal'(My, 1993, Number 303). Taken individually, each of the three main articles in this issue raises important issues about current trends in UFO research which any serious investigator must consider. Taken together, they represent a collection of significant challenges to the nascent field of \"ufology.\" Robert Durant's \"Cortile Case: Missing Evidence\" identifies several serious problems with Budd Hopkins' alien abduction \"case of the century.\" The lack of cor- roborating evidence for various specific details in Linda Cortile's (and Rich's and Dan's) reports, while not suf- ficient to establish the case as an elaborate hoax, is nev- ertheless adequate to compel others to refrain from jumping on the bandwagon promoting what may ulti- mately become a serious embarrassment to some of ufology's leading alien abduction researchers. Likewise, \"UFO Abduction Survey: A Critique\" by Robert Hall, Donald Johnson, and Mark Rodeghier points out several flaws in Hopkins' and Jacobs' Unusual Personal Experiences report. Specifically, the issue of the validity of the five indicator questions is raised. The authors' explanation of why these indicators are not valid for identifying potential abductees pro- vides a strong reason to question the results of the survey as a whole. Further, advocates striving to achieve \"sci- entific legitimacy\" would do well to follow the authors' concluding cautionary note (\"To get any serious scien- tific attention, we have to do research that is above crit- icism...Unfortunately, as evidence concerning the preva- lence of abductions, this survey does not deserve serious attention.\"). I hope that Hopkins and Jacobs will finally acknowledge that this survey is indeed flawed and back off from their claim that millions of Americans are (po- tential) abductees. To continue citing the survey will only diminish their credibility in the eyes of those they wish to convince—serious scientists involved in main- stream research. Completing the trio of articles is Dr. David Gotlib's \"False Memory Syndrome\" describing a psychological condition which has been receiving much press lately with respect to adult claims of repressed memories of childhood satanic ritual abuse. Dr. Gotlib correctly draws the parallel between the methods used by thera- pists to uncover SRA with those used by abduction re- searchers to \"help\" abductees recover memories of alien abduction. Both use hypnosis, which has been shown in many studies not to be a reliable method of recalling memories. In fact, studies show quite the opposite: that hypnosis will tend to create artificial memories. It is time abduction researchers acknowledged the inadequacy of hypnotically-recalled memories as reliable evidence of objective events. Dr. Gotlib's article provides evidence that awareness of these issues is rising among re- searchers. Also, Dennis Stacy's review of Zecharia Sitchin's Earth Chronicles series provides a refreshingly objective point of view. After giving a brief overview of Sitchin's main arguments, Stacy quite effectively skewers them, concluding that \"they do make for wonderful reading, but then so does the Bible.\" Indeed. In conclusion, this issue of MUFON UFO Journal provides a sorely needed breath of reality to a field which is normally characterized by hearsay and overzealous fantasizing. —Anson Kennedy Duluth, GA SITCHIN DEFENDED I believe that the MUFON UFO Journal has been un- duly harsh to Mr. Zecharia Sitchin by allowing Dennis Stacy's opinion to show up in the Journal under the guise of a critique. It is easy to criticize I would say to Mr. Stacy; but who among us can offer a more viable overall scenario as to the true history of our planet that covers the 450,000 year span Mr. Sitchin deals with? Though, I too have trouble with two of Mr. Sitchin's tenets, I say that nobody else in mainstream science is willing to try to put down on paper \"The History of the World 500,000 years before now,\" as Mr. Sitchin tries — and does well I might add. I agree with Dennis Stacy on the following points: I can't imagine the Nifilim living so far out in deep space and experiencing the hundreds of degree differential temperature that such a large orbit would produce. And, I wonder about I Nibiru year equaling 3600 earth years: maybe those theories will be changed as new discoveries are un- earthed. Wm. Bramley (The Gods of Eden) on this point suggests that perhaps, & just perhaps the Nifilim's ap- parent longevity (if in fact they do exist) is due to their being able to have continuity of consciousness between incarnations coupled with other advanced souls being able to recognize these souls. These are very thought provoking theories and not easily discussed or easily ac- cepted by the masses — even at the \"just considering it\" level. But I would expect MUFON to be more open to the idea of supporting Mr. Sitchin's overall view and weighing the possible against the probable. And just to remind Dennis Stacy Cj[ 4): Organic mol- ecules do exist in the cold depths of space. Even con- servative Mr. \"Billions & Billions,\" Carl Sagan speaks of our being \"star stuff.\" I sensed Dennis Stacy's bias of being overall deroga- tory towards Mr. Sitchin. A specific example of his wanting to show Mr. Sitchin in bad light: on page 18, in 1 1: Dennis Stacy states, \"...relies on it almost as if it were an eyewitness account of events, although no one SEPTEMBER 1993 NUMBER 305 PAGE 19"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL would have been alive at the time, or survived the sub- sequent cataclysm.\" I know that, he must know that. That is where his bias jumped off the page. That would be like saying continents don't drift be- cause no one saw them move. Or that dinosaurs never existed because no one saw them move either (yes, we have their bones but we also have the bones of the ce- lestial collision Mr. Sitchin speaks of: namely, the as- teroid belt, the moon — anomalous as it is — and the comets with their retrograde orbits and the outer planets that are turned over and Pluto which orbits outside the plane of the ecliptic, etc.). The puerile answer to Dennis Stacy's bewilderment is too simple to mention, but here goes: The information was told to us by people more ad- vanced than we. It is possible. Also, it is not the \"ham- mered Heaven,\" it is the \"hammered Bracelet.\" I would expect reviews such as this from Carl Sagan. not MUFON. Sure there are problems in Sitchin's the- ories — but Stacy went beyond criticizing the books, he criticized the man. And it came through loud and clear. Stacy's tone was too harsh to be just critiquing books. In 1 2 on page 18 Stacy/MUFON is sounding more like Carl Sagan again: no Ph.D. and you're left with only B.S. Is MUFON now waiting for the government to tell us what is going on? I joined MUFON because I was tired of closed-mindedness. In 14 on page 18, let me nit pick: Marduk/Nibiru ac- cording to Mr. Zecharia Sitchin did not mn into Tiamat; her moons did. Did Dennis Stacy merely read the book jacket for his book report? And the haughty paragraph I'd like the readers to review is the penultimate. Dennis Stacy has now re- duced the Bible down to \"wonderful reading.\" How benevolent of him. I would say to Dennis Stacy, try reading it in the original Hebrew text, not the version you find at your favorite motel chain. I have read all six books twice and believe that they deserve more respect than 1 saw MUFON give them this time around. — Jay J. Wheatley State Section Director Fairfield, CA Just thought I'd give you a quick bit of feedback from one Journal reader. Thank you for the excellent ar- ticle by Hall et al on how a scientific survey should be designed, measured, quantified and analyzed. The other articles, such as Dr. Gotlib's on False Memory Syndrome, in the July issue were also very well done. If this kind of article replaces the diatribes full of accusa- tions and rhetoric, I look forward to maintaining my membership. — Claudia Yapp Needham, MA • Log #930519C: August 25, 1992, Durant, OK. Bryan County. Investigated by Chuck Pine, Tuttle, OK. On Tuesday evening at 10:51 p.m., Mr. \"P\" was lying in bed and looked out his west window, which was open. He saw a light that he first thought was an aircraft, but then it rapidly moved from one position to another behind some trees and a clear opening. It jumped to the right and stopped, swung like a pendulum, swayed back and forth and stopped again. He yelled for his wife and two house guests and eventually they all went outdoors for a better view. Mrs. \"P\" said the object was at an angle and she could see a portion of the underside, which was a darker area. The object appeared to be conical with light rays emitting down and out from the bottom edge. The third witness. Mr. \"N,\" said that the object was blue on top, yellow in the middle, and white on the lower one- third. They watched it for 30 minutes. • Log #930526C: March or April, 1988, Henly, Texas. Hays County near Hwy 290. Incident investigated by T. David Spencer, Austin, Texas. At about 5:30 a.m. a young man was preparing to leave for work. He was facing west, putting equipment in his truck, when something low in the south-southwest sky caught his attention. He thought to himself, \"What is going on?\" A very large upright equi- lateral triangle came over a hill. The apex was straight up and the bottom of the triangle was parallel to the ground. The object was flying at an estimated altitude of 300 feet. Almost immediately behind it came another equilateral triangle about 50 feet higher in the sky, 20 feet behind, and westward of the first. As the objects drew closer to the wit- ness, five smaller triangles were visible clustered around the tail ends of the two larger ones and spread out behind them in a tight formation. The larger objects appeared to be about 45 feet across and the smaller ones half that size. The seven triangles looked like flames on a gas furnace, except that, rather than blue, they were a golden color. As they drew even with the witness, he could see that they were leaving a trail of gold dust or flakes that faded out at one end, like a contrail. One of the small triangles seemed to \"backfire, cough, and sputter.\" The witness could not see anything inside the triangles except stars. He is convinced that he was watching some sort of Stealth equipment be- longing to the military. The triangles were in view for about 9 seconds before they left his range of vision.

AIME MICHEL OBITUARY Famed French UFO pioneer, author and researcher Aime Michel, died on December 28, 1992, at the age of 73 in his home village of St. Vincent-les-Forts, in the Alpes de Haute Provence. Having suffered from polio in childhood, he was left with life-long physical effects, the growth of his legs having been stunted, while his arms and torso remained unimpaired. In the early 1950's Mr. Michel, while working as a journalist with the French Radio and Television Services, became seriously interested in the UFO phenomenon. He authored two UFO books during this era titled, Lueurs Sur Les Soucoupes Volantes, and Mysterieux Objets Celestes, both published in French. After being translated into English, Criterion Books, Inc., in New York, NY, published these books with the titles The Truth About Flying Saucers (1956) and Flying Saucers and the Straight-Line Mystery (1958). The publishers ac- knowledged their gratitude to Isabel Davis (deceased), Ted Bloecher, and Alexander D. Mebane, of Civilian Saucer Intelligence of New York for their generous as- sistance in editing and checking the data for the American editions. Alexander \"Lex\" D. Mebane, a MUFON member living in Venice, FL, wrote an Appendix to the second book titled \"The 1957 Saucer Wave in the United States\" to theoretically test the orthotenic lines in the U.S.A. as proposed by Michel. Isabel Davis authored a booklet on the Hopkinsville/Kelly Case of 1955 and Ted Bloecher wrote and published the book Report on the UFO Wave of 1947. Mr. Bloecher is a former MUFON State Director for New York.

The following candi- dates were nominated for this honor: Edith Fiore, Ph.D. (CA), John Ford (NY), Stanton T. Friedman (NB, Canada), Cynthia Hind (Zimbabwe, Africa), Budd Hopkins (NY), Linda M. Howe (PA), Pat Marcattilo (NJ), Dennis Stacy (TX), Leonard H. Stringfield (OH), Doris Upchurch (TX), and Donald M. Ware (FL). The balloting and election will be conducted by mail via a postcard or letter in the U.S.A. Members in foreign countries should use air mail for their ballots. Please select one person from the above list who you feel deserves this award for their outstanding work in scientifically advancing the UFO phenomenon. The deadline for receipt of ballots to MUFON in Seguin, TX has been extended to December 31, 1993. Announcement of the 1993 award winner will appear in the February 1994 issue of the MUFON UFO Journal. Please vote now while the subject is fresh in your mind. A significantly large popular vote is essen- tial if MUFON is to continue this annual award. NEW OFFICERS Sigurjon H. Kristjansson (Reykjavic) was appointed our new Representative for Iceland.
