FROM THE EDITOR I hope you'll agree that I've made it a point not to use this column as a per- sonal platform. I also hope you'll permit me this rare exception. One of the reasons why this issue of the Journal is so late in arriving at your doorsteps, for example, is the fact that I was in the middle of moving my home office. The good news is that I have much more room to work with, which, hopeful- ly, will result in greater efficiency. The bad news is that while I was moving, San Antonio and South Texas were struck by torrential rains. As a consequence, about half of my UFO and fortean phenomena library have been ruined beyond repair. The toll includes both rare and common hardbacks, paperbacks and journals, the latter including International UFO Reporter, Flying Saucer Review, Fortean Times, Pursuit and so on. Many of these I will be able to replace, others I probably will not. If you have any duplicate items in your possession for sale I wish you'd drop me a line with a brief description of the item's title, condition and cost, which I'll be happy to pay. It goes without saying that any assistance is greatly appreciated. IN THIS ISSUE THE BELGIUM UFO FLAP   Bob Pratt 3 DESERT SECRETS   Erich A.

Belgium, one of the smallest and most densely populated countries in Europe, is about a third the size of the state of Indiana and, with a population of more than ten million, has twice as many people. It is bounded on the northwest by the North Sea, on the north and northeast by The Netherlands, on the east by West Germany, on the southeast by Luxembourg, and on the west and southwest by France. Since last October Belgium has been experiencing almost daily sight- ings of large triangular-shaped UFOs similar to those reported throughout the United States on countless occa- sions since the mid-1970s. As of late May, the Belgium UFO research group SOBEPS had in- vestigated about 650 cases, collecting reports from more than 900 witnesses, many of them highly com- petent professional people. It is estimated that at least 10,000 Belgians have seen the UFOs, described at times as being \"as big as or bigger than an aircraft carrier.\" In many respects the sightings have paralleled those reported in the Hud- son Valley area of New York and Connecticut just north of New York City in 1983-1986, as reported in the book Night Siege: The Hudson Valley UFO Sightings (by Dr. J. Allen Hynek, Philip J. Imbrogno and Bob Pratt, Ballantine Books, 1987). \"It was really astonishing for us to read the preface of Night Siege\" says Patrick Ferryn of SOBEPS, in Brussels. \"Changing only a few words, exactly the same could be writ- Belgium UFO By Bob Pratt ten to give an account of the position of affairs here! The same goes for many entire pages and excerpts elsewhere in the book.\" Unusual Cooperation In what is probably unique in the history of worldwide ufology, the Belgium government has been assisting SOBERS in investigating the sightings. The Ministry of the Interior ordered the Gendarmerie Nationale (a com- bination of police and army, many of whose members have reported see- ing the UFOs) to give SOBERS copies of all UFO reports and to immediately advise SOBERS of new sightings. Among the witnesses were nearly 200 members and of- ficers of the Gendarmerie Nationale as well as policemen, military and civilian pilots, air traffic con- trollers, meteorologists, aeronautical engineers and physicists. In addition, the Ministry of Defense, through the Belgium Air Force, has authorized SOBERS to contact radar specialists, pilots and installations. In an unheard of display of cooperation, the Air Force even had two military aircraft and their crews on standby at Bierset Airport, near Liege, to work with SOBERS during the long, four- day Easter weekend. \"One of these aircraft, a Hawker Siddeley 748, was equipped with an impressive infrared video camera,\" says Ferryn, who is a television direc- tor and producer. \"We also had professional video equipment and sophisticated in- Flap struments. On the ground and in the whole eastern and southern part of Belgium we had teams with CB radios and mobile phones. \"Last, but not least, an important Air Force radar station at Glons was connected with our improvised head- quarters in the Bierset Airport.\" Briefly, this is what has been happening: • The sightings started in October near Eupen, close to the Dutch and German border, and then progressed steadily westward to Liege, Namur, Wavre (just southeast of the capital, Brussels), Mons and finally toward the French border. The area involved is about 100 miles long. • Most of the sightings were at night, but a few were in the daytime. Many were CE-I's and CE-II's. • Among the witnesses were nearly 200 members and officers of the Gen- darmerie Nationale as well as police- men, military and civilian pilots, air traffic controllers, meteorologists, aeronautical engineers and physicists. • Most of the witnesses reported seeing a dark, triangular shaped ob- ject with three bright lights and a red flashing light in the middle. Often, people saw one or more rows of scin- tillating lights on the side of the triangle.    _ • Several times highly competent witnesses used such expressions as \"as big as a football field\" or \"huge\" or \"massive\" to describe the UFO. Some even said it was \"as big as or bigger than an aircraft carrier.\" When seen from the side in profile, the ob- ject was described as \"very high\" with large \"windows.\" • One witness said that \"while the object was flying slowly directly overhead, one could not see the front part and the end at the same time because it was too big.\" • Some triangular-shaped objects were \"modest\" in size, only about as large as small aircraft. MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 267 July 1990"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"• Often the object hovered for minutes at a time. When it began moving, it usually moved very slow- ly, too slow to be a conventional airplane. However, at times it would suddenly accelerate so rapidly that it would be across the horizon in a se- cond or two — and sometimes it would flash right back. • The object was nearly always noiseless or made only a faint hum- ming sound, like an electric engine or a sewing machine. Slow Turns • Many times while hovering or moving slowly it would pivot, turning 90 degrees and even 180 degrees. • In three cases (as some witnesses in the Hudson Valley sightings also reported), people saw structures underneath \"with heavy metal parts, crisscross effects, diamond-shape work, tubular things here and there.\" • Some people claimed to have seen triangles that changed shape into a round light which later opened, releasing a great number of small red objects going in all directions, and then change into a triangle again. • Very often, sightings occurred in densely populated areas and also near illuminated highways and ex- pressways, just as happened in the Hudson Valley sightings. Says Ferryh: \"As I visited the Hudson Valley and the Connecticut area two years ago (for archaeological purposes), I can say the landscapes are very similar to what one can see around Eupen, Liege, Namur, etc.\" • Some witnesses said they signal- ed with their car lights and the UFO would respond with a similar light signal or by moving at the moment the signal was made. One of the biggest nights of sightings was November 29, 1989, when several UFOs were seen by hundreds of people around Eupen. SOBERS collected nearly 120 reports from this night alone. The first important sighting that night came from the Gendarmerie. Two officers in their patrol car were lit up by a beam of light coming from a dark triangle equipped with three \"projectors\" and a winking red light. The object was huge and made a faint humming sound. It was hovering at an altitude of 600 to 900 feet. One officer said the light was so dazzling \"that we could read a newspaper under it.\" The object then moved slowly in the direction of the nearby La Gileppe Dam, where it hovered for 45 minutes. It then moved southwest about 13 miles and hovered over the city of Spa for 30 minutes before disappearing. In their investigation, SOBERS researchers learned that a number of other people had seen the UFO even earlier that evening. One was a Gen- darmerie officer on duty on the third floor of the Eupen station who saw a luminous rectangular object about 65 feet long between him and the rear wall of the station 650 feet away: It was just below the level of his eyes and was moving very slowly. \"It was like a big chamber,\" he said. MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 267 July 1990"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Astounded, he watched it drift slowly out of sight and immediately radioed two officers in a patrol car who were in the area it was heading for. Several minutes later they saw it coming in their direction and they could see the underside of it. The two officers told SOBERS it was triangular in shape and that when it moved a \"balancing movement\", was clearly noted, during which a sort of dome was visible on the upper side. One of the officers said he had never seen anything so beautiful in his life, and as he spoke he was very af- fected and seemed about to weep. Air Force Alert Another important night of sight- ings took place on March 30. That evening, 15 members of the Gen- darmerie on duty in different places around Wavre (about 15 miles southeast of Brussels) saw eight white luminous objects in the sky that were three to five times larger than a star. The objects moved away and then came back very fast, glowing red as they returned. The commander of the Gendar- merie station at Wavre alerted the Air Force radar station at Glons and the Air Force base at Beauvechain. Two F-16s immediately came into the sighting area (and later an AWACS aircraft) and were literally guided by witnesses on the ground. The next day newspapers reported that the F-16s \"came home with an empty bag,\" but that was not true. After weeks of computer analysis, the Belgium Air Force Headquarters reported to the Ministry of Defense that five different military radars (two on the F-16s and three radar stations) had detected unidentified echoes at the same moment and in the same place indicated by witnesses on the ground. Furthermore, the report con- firmed that the objects had moved with incredible speeds. Details of that report appeared on TV and in newspapers on May 19 — coincidentally the anniversary of the 1986 overflights in Brazil when six military jet fighters chased (and sometimes were chased by) 20 to 30 UFOs that were being tracked by air traffic controllers on radar over vast areas of that country. The sightings on November 29, 1989 created a sensation and were heavily publicized by the press, TV and radio. SOBERS was immediate- ly snowed under with reports and opened a UFO Hotline — just as Philip Imbrogno and his investigative team did in Connecticut during the early heavy sightings in 1983. \"People called literally at all hours of the day and night,\" Ferryn says. \"It is striking to see how, at one and the same time, a great part of the public and the press have reacted to these events exactly in the same way here and in the U.S. (as reported in Night Siege) r Some of those calling did report what later turned out to be conven- tional aircraft. However, Ferryn says, most of the witnesses are familiar with civilian and military aircraft because there are many bases in the area, and they were certain they were not see- ing aircraft. \"We all went through the same stages of thinking,\" Ferryn says. \"We first thought of ultralight aircraft, then military aircraft, the mystery plane, the phantom fliers (a kind of 'Black Baron,' as we called it) and so on. Of course, some officials and specialists claimed astronomical mistakes, holograms, lasers, temperature inversions and so on. We must admit we also wondered at first if it could be some sort of sophisticated ultralight aircraft. Of course, now, none of these hypotheses make any sense.\" Stealth There were numerous rumors that the American-built F-117 Stealth Fighter was being flown in Belgian skies. The rumors were partially con- firmed by the French newspaper VSD on April 21 in an interview with U.S. Air Force Col. Tom Tolin. He reported- ly told the newspaper: \"F-117s are fly- ing in Europe during night missions, sometimes piloted by United Kingdom Royal Air Force pilots, but we are not Stealth Fighters could ac- count for some sightings, but not for the reports of huge triangular-shaped objects that hovered or moved slow- ly, suddenly accelerated and disappeared across the horizon in seconds, or released hundreds of small red objects that flew in all directions. authorized to tell you where.\" The journalist's theory, of course, was that the UFOs that had been seen since October were actually the F-117s. If F-117s were flown over Belgium, that could account for some sightings, but not for the reports of huge triangular-shaped objects that hovered or moved slowly, suddenly accelerated and disappeared across the horizon in seconds, or released hundreds of small red objects that flew in all directions. With so much UFO activity, SOBEPS was able to collect 25 dif- ferent video tapes made during the sightings. \"Three of these are really in- teresting for they clearly show what is undeniably not a conventional air- craft or anything else known,\" says Ferryn. \"As a professional in this field, I have enlarged and treated the in- teresting sequences in slow motion with sophisticated equipment. \"One film shows three important spots of light forming a big triangle having a red flashing light in the center. It flew slowly low over our capital on March 30, the same date the 15 Gen- darmes of Wavre saw the eight objects southeast of Brussels.\" SOBEPS also has some photographs \"but they are extremely disappointing because either nothing shows or what is seen doesn't correspond with the sightings,\" says Ferryn. \"Only one of these shows what could be a triangle or a trapezoidal- shaped object, while it was observed as being rounded and ray-shaped.\" MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 267 July 1990"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"The Brazilian military had a similar experience in 1977 when it was in- vestigating a long series of sightings around the small town of Colares at the mouth of the Amazon River just north of the major city of Belem. (The sightings are discussed by Jacques Vallee in Confrontations: A Scientist's Search for Alien Contact, Ballantine Books, 1990.) A Brazilian Air Force team spent approximately 30 days and nights in the area, during which they shot about 300 photographs of UFOs. In 1981 the officer in charge of the team, now a colonel, told Bob Pratt and Charles Tucker (of Nappanee, In- diana) that he and his men photographed eight different shapes of UFOs, including several that were triangular or like a pyramid. On several occasions, when the photos were printed they showed something completely different from what he and his men saw. Once they photographed a disc- shaped object that was twice the size of a Boeing 737 and had many win- dows but the photo showed only a point of light. Another time a large fiery ball of bluish light about 70 meters away suddenly blinked out and all they could see was a green light and some distance below that a Another time a large fiery ball of bluish light about 70 meters away suddenly blink- ed out and all they could see was a green light and some distance below that a red one. Yet the photograph showed a large disc-shaped object standing vertically, rather than horizontally. red one. Yet the photograph showed a large disc-shaped object standing vertically, rather than horizontally. Other aspects of the Belgian sightings have been reported in other countries as well, proving once again, as we all know, that this is a global phenomenon. One Belgian witness said that when the UFO was overhead, he could not see both the front and back at the same time because it was so huge. In the Hudson Valley sightings, a securi- ty officer at the Indian Point Nuclear Power Reactor at Buchanan, New York, reported much the same thing. On the night of July 24, 1984, a huge triangular-shaped object hovered over the reactor for ten minutes and the of- ficer, watching it on the monitor of a security camera mounted atop a ninety-five-foot pole had to pan the camera 180 degrees to scan the en- tire object from front to back. Another point of similarity is the in- credible acceleration. Some Belgian witnesses said the UFO would shoot off across the horizon in a second or two, and sometimes come back just as fast. In Colusa, California, in 1976 a witness reported seeing a UFO sud- denly shoot across the sky to a far away mountain and then return just as quickly. In 1977 two Memphis policemen watching a large triangular UFO hover over a golf course said it disappeared over the horizon in two seconds. During the Hudson Valley sightings in 1983-86, one witness saw a triangular-shaped UFO vanish across Mazy, Belgium December 11, 1989 event Illustrated by Gerard Grede \\ '^. MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 267 July 1990"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"the horizon in seconds, and in another sighting a couple said a boomerang-shaped object \"streaked from one end of the sky to the other, and then back again in a split second.\" In the U.S. in the past 15 years, a number of people, including military personnel, have reported seeing UFOs shoot from near the ground far out in- to the sky and vanish in seconds. And similar actions were reported in the small city of Pinheiro, in northern Brazil, where sightings occurred nearly every night for four months in 1977. The mayor of Pinheiro said the UFO, a large, fiery red ball of light that often hovered about 1,000 feet above the town, would sometimes suddenly shoot so far out into the atmosphere as to be lost among the stars, and at times it would shoot straight back down to earth again. The enormous sizes reported in Belgium have now become common and are typical of the triangular or boomerang-shaped objects reported in the U.S., Canada, Great Britain, Iran and elsewhere. The Belgian reports are exciting for many reasons, but especially because of the numerous high quality witnesses and the official government coopera- tion, and because they affirm once again the reality of the phenomenon. Support SOBERS Members of SOBEPS are very interested in learning about sightings elsewhere in the world similar to those now occurring in Belgium, and also are interested in learning more about the F-117 and B-2 Stealth aircraft. Anyone with unclassified information about these planes is invited to share it with SOBEPS. The organization is also encouraged and inviting researchers around the world to join in a greater, freer exchange of UFO data. \"I'm definitely convinced we must exchange and share information,\" says SOBEPS co-founder Patrick Ferryn. \"And this is an encouragement and a warm request to do so. Of course, we already exchange publications and bulletins, but this is not enough.\" In addition to printed reports and data, SOBEPS (its reports are in French) is interested in exchanging video tapes, films and photos.

Some of the most secret areas in the world are located in the deserts of Nevada. It is here that top secret aircraft'such as the F-117A, F-19 and Aurora have been and are being tested. It is also here that camouflag- ed hangers for alien spacecraft have purportedly been built and where alien spacecraft (either recovered from crashes or \"donated\") are routinely being test flown by human pilots, ac- cording to some sources. One of the most sensitive military installations in the United States is Nellis Air Force Base. It is located eight miles Northeast of Las Vegas, Nevada. Nellis is a Tactical Air Com- mand (TAG) Base. It is home to the USAF's Tactical Fighter Weapons Center, F-15, F-15E, F-16, F-lll, A-10, AT-38; 57th Fighter Weapons Wing, F-16 Aggressor Operations; USAF Air Demonstration Squadron (Thunderbirds); USAF Fighter Weapons School; 4440th Tactical Fighter Training Group (Red Flag); 4443rd Tactical Training Group (Air Warrior); 554th Operations Support Wing; 554th Range Group; 820th Civil Engineering Squadron (Red Horse), the 206th Communications Group and the enigmatic ALIEN Technology Center (ATC). 819 Nellis Air Force Base proper covers an area of 11,274 acres. However, bombing and gunnery ranges extend this area to over 8,000,000 acres. Nellis employs over 11,000 military and 1200 civilian personnel. Nellis AFB has effectively gobbled up nearly twenty-five percent of Southern Nevada! 1 Near the Northwest corner of the Nellis Ranges in Mud Dry Lake, is \"Area 30\" also known as the Tonopah Test Range Airfield or Tonopah Base. It is about 150 miles Northwest of Las Vegas. Tonopah is informally referred By Erich A. Aggen, Jr. to as the \"Mellon Strip\" or \"Sandia Strip.\" The 37th Tactical Fighter Wing of the 4450th Tactical Group is bas- ed at Tonopah. They fly the formerly top .secret F-117A Nighthawk stealth fighter. Two Nighthawk squadrons, composed of 59 F-117As, operate out of Tonopah Base. The Nighthawk squadrons have been operational since 1983 and are known as \"Team One - Furtim Vigilans.\" The F-117As are protected by individual nuclear hardened hangers while based at Tonopah. Eventually they will be dispersed to other bases throughout the United States and some foreign countries. The 4477th Test and Evaluation Squadron (TES) which goes by the name \"Red Eagles\" is also based at Tonopah. The Red Eagle squadron is composed of Soviet-built fighters - Mig-17, Mig-19, Mig-21, Mig-23, Mig-25, Mig-27 and Sukhoi Su-20s supplied by Egypt, Israel and Afghanistan. The Red Eagles par- ticipate in \"Red Flag\" combat train- ing exercises against U.S. fighters. 11 Dreamland Mysterious \"Area 51\" is located well within the Nellis Ranges and adjoins Yucca Flat. It is about 85 miles North- west of Las Vegas. Area 51 is also called \"Dreamland\" due to the base's radio call sign for the Nellis AFB air traffic controllers. Near the center of Area 51 is Groom Dry Lake. The dry lake bed is surrounded by mountains and contains numerous aircraft hangers, support facilities, airstrips and a 12,000 foot runway for emergencies. The U-2 spy planes and the Mach 3+ SR-71 Blackbird were first tested at Area 51. In the late 1950s and early 1960s, the base at Groom Lake was known as the \"Ranch Airstrip.\" Today it is called the \"Watertown Strip.\" In the mid-1970s a joint USAF/NASA hypersonic research program using an X-24C high-speed aircraft was under consideration. This program was to be a follow-on project to the X-15 research aircraft of the 1960s and the X-24B research pro- gram of the 1970s. The X-24C was envisaged as a rocket-boosted delta planform lifting body to be air launched by a B-52. Propulsion systems to be tested in the program included ram- jets, scramjets and rockets. General William J. Evans, then Commander of Air Force Systems Command, com- mented that, \"If we were to decide on a new aircraft (to replace the SR-71) it would probably be a product of the X-24C hypersonic investigation.\" Since the early 1980s, according to various sources in the aviation com- munity, the USAF and Lockheed have been testing experimental Mach 6 to Mach 7 hypersonic air-breathing manned aircraft from Area 51. The super-secret \"Aurora\" project is thought to be the culmination of this research program. Aurora apparent- ly was conceived as the stealth replacement for the SR-71. Aurora is believed to use liquid methane fuel. Some reports indicate that 20 to 25 Aurora reconnaissance aircraft are already operating out of Tonopah Base. Aviation Week Magazine (12/18/89) reports that \"Ground observers have seen and heard a distinctive aircraft which may be the Aurora flying over the Mojave Desert ... at high altitude and high speed.\" The sound of the Aurora's engines during takeoff has been described as \"a sound like the sky ripping.\" Aurora's engines have an unusual pulsing sound and leave a \"linked- sausage-shaped\" smoke trail. The F-19 and/or RF-19 is another secret aircraft reportedly being flown from Area 51. The F-19 has been designed from the outset as a super- sonic stealth fighter under the \"Have Blue\" stealth prototype program. It is MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 267 July 1990"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"thought to have a rounded-delta plan- form similar to the Space Shuttle. It has also been compared to the Lock- heed D-21 ramjet reconnaissance drone launched by the SR-71 and B-52. Some aviation authorities believe the F-19 is designed as a stealth replacement for the F-15 Eagle. Area S-4 Area \"S-4,\" as revealed in the ex- traordinary accounts of one Robert Lazar, is thought to be situated in the Southwest corner of Area 51. It is at the S-4 base or facility that alien spacecraft are alleged to be stored. Test flights of alien craft with human pilots at the controls have supposed- ly been conducted for several years. Several project codenames for the \"manned\" test flights have surfaced, such as \"Snowbird\" and \"Redlight.\" Various aspects of alien technology are being studied at S-4, according to Lazar. In fact, the S-4 base appears to be solely dedicated to the investiga- tion and evaluation of alien spacecraft and technology. Obviously, one point of this research is to find potential ap- plications or \"spinoffs\" for terrestrial technology. Thus far, however, the most revolutionary breakthroughs have probably been applied to secret military programs. We can surmise that many of the \"black\" projects owe their success and perhaps their very existence, to discoveries at S-4 (and similar bases, if they exist). An interesting coincidental fact in regard to Area S-4 is that the \"S-4\" designation has a possible historical antecedent. When President Roosevelt was examining the feasibili- ty of building an atomic bomb he ap- pointed a special \"S-l\" Committee to study the proposal. They were to evaluate the project and provide recommendations to the President. Perhaps \"S-4\" isn't just a geographical reference point on a map. It may have a double meaning. \"S-l\" was actual- ly Section 1 of the Office of Scientific Research and Development (OSRD). One of the most \"black\" aircraft projects is known variously as \"Pro- ject 100\" or \"Model 100.\" Test flights Some of the most significant UFO sightings and reports have occurred in New Mexico and the Southwestern United States: the UFO crash at Roswell on July 2, 1947, the Socorro landing of April 24, 1964, the alleged deliberate contact with aliens at Holloman AFB the following day, and the Moody abduction at Almagordo on August 13, 1975. are apparently being carried out at Holloman Air Force Base near Alamagordo, New Mexico. General Dynamics is thought to be the chief contractor. Project 100 appears to be still another experimental program utilizing stealth technology. Strange aircraft have also been reported by residents in areas near Roswell Air Force Base in New Mex- ico. Roswell AFB has been suggested as a possible site where F-117As may be stationed. Tests of the General Dynamics AGM-129A Advanced (stealth) Cruise Missile, possibly to be used in conjunction with the F-117A, may be an ongoing program at Roswell. Adjacent military bases, such as the White Sands Missile Range, may also be involved. White Sands has ex- tensive facilities for testing different types of weapons delivery systems. Some of the most significant UFO sightings and reports have occurred in New Mexico and the Southwestern United States, e.g., the UFO crash at Roswell, N.M., on July 2, 1947; the Socorro, N.M., landing of April 24, 1964; the alleged deliberate contact with aliens at Holloman AFB, N.M., on April 25, 1964; the Sgt. Charles L. Moody abduction at Alamagordo, N.M., on August 13, 1975 and a num- ber of low-level intrusions and landings by UFOs near nuclear weapons storage areas at Kirtland AFB, N.M., in August of 1980. New Mexico contains the highest concentration of nuclear weapons research and development facilities in the United States. Nuclear Interest UFOs seem to have a special in- terest in nuclear weapons storage centers. Huge nuclear weapons development and management com- plexes are located at Holloman AFB, N.M. The 410 warheads stored at Kirtland AFB constitute the USAF's largest single nuclear weapons storage site. The USAF depot at Lake Meade Base near Nellis AFB, Nevada, stores some 260 nuclear warheads. Camp Mercury, Headquarters of the Nevada Test Site, is also near Nellis. All U.S. and British underground nuclear weapons tests take place at the Nevada Test Site. 2 There are persistent reports of possi- ble underground bases and laboratories controlled or operated by humans and aliens in areas of Nevada and New Mexico. On May 5, 1980, near Cimar- ron, New Mexico, a mother and her six-year-old son were reportedly ab- ducted by aliens and taken to an underground installation. At this base they were forced to undergo unnerv- ing physical examinations. A cow was abducted at the same time and sub- jected to a particularly gruesome vivisection. The human abductees were helpless witnesses to this frightening operation. An investigation revealed that the alleged alien underground laboratory was situated in the southwest comer of New Mexico, somewhat west of Las Cruces. The While Sands Missile Test Center, Fort Bliss and Holloman Air Force Base are located 30 to 50 miles from this area. 10 Paul Bennewitz and other sources have reported that an alien base is located near Dulce, New Mexico. It is thought to be beneath the Jicarilla Apache Indian Reservation near Mount Archuleta. Some information suggests that the Dulce base is only one of several in the four corners area of Nevada, New Mexico, Utah and Colorado. All are purportedly on In- dian reservations. 16 The most in- teresting fact about this geographical MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 267 July 1990"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"10 area is that one of the \"ground entry points\" for the National Emergency Airborne Command Post (NEACP), is based at the airport in Farmington, New Mexico, near the Navajo Indian Reservation. Farmington is about 70 miles southwest of Dulce. NEACPS (pronounced \"Kneecaps\"), are specially modified Boeing 747s main- tained by the USAF for use in nuclear war or other nationwide emergencies. They are to serve as command posts for the National Command Authori- ty, (the President and other govern- ment officials). 2 The information provided by Robert Lazar and others indicates that another underground base jointly controlled by humans and aliens has been built under Area 51 in Nevada. The data supplied by John Lear - questioned by some ufologists - indicates that sometime between 1972 and 1974, a huge underground complex was con- structed for and with the help of aliens. Underground Leonard H. Stringfield reported the existence of a secret underground military base in his Status Report III on UFO Crash/Retrievals. The base was said to be located in Texas on the Fort Hood Army Military Reservation. Sometime in the late 1960s a pilot was forced to make an emergency landing in a restricted area of Fort Hood. He was surrounded by soldiers and taken into custody for questioning. He ob- served a huge section of land which opened up like \"giant sliding doors,\" revealing a huge corridor inside. He was then blindfolded and transported to the underground base. He was in- terrogated for several hours and then released. The enormous amount of scientific and technological activity occurring in the deserts of the southwest (and other locations), implies several things. First, although we may have access to alien technology, _we obviously have not been able to discover exactly how it works and/or how to duplicate it. We cannot tap its full potential. No astronauts (that we know of), are mak- ing trips to the Moon or Mars in flying saucers. Aircraft and spacecraft are still being designed using conventional technology. Like computer scientists of the 1950s suddenly presented with a modern pocket computer, we may be able to utilize the technology without really understanding it or how it was manufactured. Even if a computer scientist of the 1950s was given all the specifications for a pocket computer and had a complete theoretical understanding of how it functioned he would still not be able to duplicate it. The technological infrastructure for reproducing all of the advanced com- ponents in a pocket computer would simply not exist. However, it would be possible for a scientist of the 1950s to determine the composition of many of the elements and materials used to manufacture the components. He might also gain some insights from the exterior design of the pocket com- puter and the internal arrangement of its components. We may be in the same \"fix\" in regard to understanding alien spacecraft. \"Spinoffs\" from alien technology are most likely to be evident in aerospace materials technology and advanced aircraft and spacecraft design. Stealth technology is a case in point - observed from the front, back or sides the B-2 stealth bomber resembles the classic flying saucer and the F-117A stealth fighter looks like it belongs on the set of a science fiction movie instead of on an Air Force base. Second, many UFO reports originating from international sources seem to confirm the existence of alien underground bases. 3 Combined human/alien underground bases have also been reported. This activity ap- pears to be very widespread and to have a long history. The reality of these secret facilities would imply that either the aliens are using them for their own purposes without human control and/or that some type of cooperative effort between aliens and humans has been going on for a very long time. The military and governmental hierarchies of most countries ap- parently consider UFOs and aliens to be sensitive subjects - somewhat on the level of nuclear war or nuclear ter- rorism. Why? The two biggest ques- tions we have to answer are, (1) Is there a legitimate reason for keeping a lid on the subject of UFOs? and, (2) How is this nearly airtight lid being kept on? The answers to these ques- tions may lead in nonhuman directions. References 1.

Auchettl is a new book researched by Paul A. Norman and John W. Auchettl. This is a definitive investiga- tion of the UFO case that attracted in- ternational attention on January 20, 1988 when the Knowles family car and occupants were allegedly picked up from the Eyre Highway, near Mun- drabilla in Western Australia, by a UFO. The authors have documented the case thoroughly, starting with the in- itial interviews, area profile, general observations by other witnesses, med- ical examinations, physical effects, animal study, dust particle collection and analysis, automobile inspection and analysis, wheel and tire analysis and ending with their conclusions. Six pages of photographs and diagrams illustrate this unusual and important case. The majority of the information has been shared with the Mutual UFO Network during their investigation. MUFON highly recommends this book if you want the complete in- vestigation. It contains 21 chapters, 306 pages, more than 80,000 words, and 143 diagrams and photos.

MJ-12 Report (WASHINGTON, D.C.; July 7, 1990) — A report released by a scientific research organization supports the authenticity of TOP SECRET docu- ments which outline the recovery and analysis of the wreckage of an Unidentified Flying Object and four alien bodies in New Mexico by the U.S. government 43 years ago today. The report by nuclear physicist Stanton T. Friedman, who has been researching UFOs since 1958, notes that there is no evidence which proves the documents to be false, but many previously unknown details which point to their authenticity. The first of the three documents in question purports to be a TOP SECRET/EYES ONLY briefing paper prepared for President-elect Dwight D. Eisenhower in November 1952. It relates the crash of an Unidentified Flying Object outside Roswell, New Mexico, in July 1947. \"On July 7, 1947, a secret opera- tion was begun to assure recovery of the wreckage of this object for scien- tific study,\" according to the docu- ment. \"During the course of this operation, aerial reconnaissance discovered that four small human-like beings had apparently ejected from the craft at some point before it ex- ploded.\" The alleged briefing paper notes that all four bodies were removed for study, along with wreckage from the craft, \"and news reporters were given the effective cover story that the ob- ject had been a misguided weather research balloon.\" Attached to the document is a memo to the Secretary of Defense, apparently signed by President Harry S. Truman on September 24, 1947, authorizing \"Operation Majestic Twelve\" (also referred to as Majic 12 or MJ-12), a TOP SECRET research and development/intelligence opera- tion responsible directly to the Presi- dent to assure recovery of the wreck- age and bodies for scientific study. A TOP SECRET memorandum which was found in the National Ar- chives with recently-declassified government documents refers to the NSC/MJ-12 Special Studies Project in connection with the National Se- curity Council. The memo was sent to General Nathan F. Twining, Chief of Staff of the Air Force, by Robert Cutler, Special Assistant for National Security to President Eisenhower. The three documents were re- leased to the public by UFO research- ers in 1987 and immediately were called into question by skeptics. To settle the controversy, the Fund for UFO Research, a nonprofit scientific organization based in Washington, DC, awarded a $16,000 grant to Mr. Friedman to investigate the MJ-12 documents and personalities. After more than a year of investiga- tion, which included extensive inter- views with the relatives and colleagues of MJ-12 members and visits to presidential libraries and the National Archives, Friedman concluded that \"none of the arguments passes a scientific screening as to their worthwhileness. \"The bottom line is that the documents must therefore be con- sidered genuine,\" Friedman said, \"and that a small group within the U.S. government has managed to withhold from the people of planet Earth the proof that man is not alone.\" Copies of the Final Report on Operation Majestic 12 by Stanton T. Friedman are available from the Fund for UFO Research for $10.00, plus $2.50 for postage and handling. To order, write: Fund for UFO Research, P.O. Box 277, Mt. Rainier, MD 20712.

The SSE was formed in 1980 for \"the advancement of our under- standing of anomalous phenomena and the sharing of such advances with a wider concerned community. The term 'anomalous' is used to charac- terize those phenomena that appear to contradict existing scientific knowledge and which, for these or other reasons, are generally regarded by the scientific community as being outside their established fields of in- quiry. The Society seeks to provide for the discussion of these topics in a forum modeled on that of mainstream science. Its membership is drawn from practitioners of science who have ac- quired a first-hand knowledge and understanding of the scientific process. \"The Society has no intention of endorsing the reality or significance of any particular topic. Neither does the Society regard current scientific knowledge as immutable, and no sub- ject will be prohibited from discussion or publication simply because it is not now an accepted part of scientific or scholarly knowledge. For each of these topics, the Society anticipates that members will approach the sub- ject with the view that honest evi- dence deserves investigation that is unprejudiced and constructively critical. \"Tim Dinsdale (1924-1987) spent much of his life carrying out \"active and demanding research on the pro- blem posed by reports of a 'Loch Ness Monster.' In this quest, he.demon- strated an exemplary dedication, in- tegrity and modesty. He also leav- ened the weight of his undertaking by a due sense of proportion and a sense of humor that was invariably directed at himself. \"When Dinsdale became interested in the possible existence of the Loch Ness Monster, he first spent a year analyzing the available evidence. In 1960, using a borrowed 16mm movie camera and on the last day of his first expedition to Loch Ness, he filmed a large object that moved rapidly across (and at times just below the surface of) the water. This object was larger than any of the species that are known to inhabit the Loch. \"Dinsdale spent the rest of his life seeking more and better evidence. He left his career in aeronautical en- gineering to make his living in ways that allowed him time for field work. In addition to this sacrifice, he per- sistently refused to derive any monetary gain from his work at Loch Ness.

Oxford Conference On Saturday, June 23, the First In- ternational Conference on the Circles- Effect was held at Oxford under the chairmanship of Dr. Terence Meaden and scientific colleagues. Superbly organized by Dr. Derek Elsom of the Tornado & Storm Research Organiza- tion (TORRO), the conference was a show-case for Terence Meaden's hypothesis that the crop circles are formed by a hitherto unrecognized at- mospheric phenomenon possessing strong electrical and electromagnetic properties, the Plasma Vortex. This is the latest development in Meaden's pursuit of the subject, as an at- mospheric physicist, since his initial involvement which dates to 1980. Addressed mainly to the scientific community and containing much highly technical material from Pro- fessor John Snow of Purdue Univer- sity, USA, and Professors Kikuchi and Ohtsuki of Tokyo University, the Con- ference was enlivened for laymen by spectacular video pictures of recent crop circle events taken from the air by Busty Taylor of CCCS, the Cen- tre for Crop Circle Studies, and a talk by Jenny Randies and Paul Fuller of the British UFO Research Association (BUFORA) on the relationship of ufology to cereology. The Conference Proceedings are available from CERES, 54 Frome Road, Bradford- on-Avon, Wiltshire, England, BA15 1LD. What forcibly struck many of the lay members of the audience was that the hidden agenda of the Conference was the question which has dogged this subject for several years — is there or isn't there an \"intelligence\" behind this extraordinary phenomenon? Terence Meaden adhered with deter- mination — some would say, valiantly — to the view that \"blind forces,\" operating mechanistically, will even- tually explain all that we have been seeing in the crop fields (mainly in southern England), even including the extraordinary new patterns which have appeared since May of this year. (With 200 events logged halfway through, this \"season\" seems sure to set several records.) It did not seem to many of us that the visiting experts actively supported the Plasma Vortex hypothesis. They seemed, rather, to be saying that the Plasma Vortex, if Dr. Meaden suc- ceeded in developing his atmospheric model and demonstrating its relation- ship to the crop circles, would pro- bably not be inconsistent with their own studies of atmospheric and ionisation phenomena. This falls, of course, considerably short of en- dorsement. Terence Meaden himself acknow- ledged that decades of research might be required to define the Plasma Vor- tex in precise terms; and he added that it could well be capable of generating hundreds of different crop circle patterns, most of which we have not yet seen and none of which, it seems, can be predicted at this stage. Commenting on the new patterns seen this year, Meaden remarked that they were interesting \"aberrant forms\" from which we might well learn more about the physics of the \"normal\" oc- currences. It is doubtful, however, that many of the audience felt able to distinguish \"normal\" from \"aberrant\" after the startling display of new forms given to us by Busty Taylor. Whole-hearted endorsement for the Plasma Vortex, even if not forth- coming from Meaden's scientific peers at this stage, was, however, given from the unexpected quarter of BUFORA. The conclusion reached by Paul Fuller and Jenny Randies at the end of an inevitably somewhat selec- tive account of the UFO phenomenon as we have known it since 1947 was that \"UFO research in its own right is now dead and has become a part of meteorolgy.\" Those of us who have followed the UFO phenomenon all these years past (including Jenny Randies' own lively and often startl- ing accounts of it) can only extend our best wishes to meteorology. The conclusion of the Conference was marred (or, as some felt it, given a degree of dramatic interest) by an angry exchange between the Chair and Colin Andrews (co-author with Pat Delgado of the superbly illustrated Circular Evidence). Andrews drew at- tention to a recent event in which a three-ringed circle, known to have oc- curred in a remote part of a farm in Wiltshire in late May, had \"grown\" a fourth ring (roughly 1000 feet in cir- cumference) when re-surveyed in June. This did not, he said, seem compatible with any hypothesis based on meteorology alone. Terence Meaden questioned the evidence for this statement, adding that if it was in- deed true, hoax might be the explana- tion. (As it happens, CCCS possesses aerial photographs which put occur- rence beyond doubt; the Centre will be publishing details, after careful evaluation, in The Crop Circle Enigma later this year.) Those who attended the Con- ference expecting that a definitive ex- planation for the crop circles in meteorological terms was now within sight must have left it disappointed. None of us had any doubt, however, about Terence Meaden's courageous attempt to fit the phenomenon to terms which he would call \"rational,\" even if for the time being his eleven- year-old endeavors seem to many of us to rest more on faith and hope than any developed model of what may be happening. But for all of us it was worth coming for the many \"aberrant\" forms exhibited by Busty Taylor. \"Case not yet closed,\" we laymen MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 267 July 1990"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"14 felt — and it's not even the proper time to ask the jury to retire.

And happy hunting! - DS Gulf Breeze Capture From the Just-When-You-Thought-It- Was-Safe-To-Carp-About-Gulf-Breeze Department comes the following from the Wednesday, July 18, 1990 New York Times. \"WASHINGTON, July 17 - Six soldiers missing from an Army in- telligence unit at a sensitive National Security Agency eavesdropping post in West Germany have been ap- prehended in Florida and are the focus of a routine counterespionage investigation, the Pentagon said to- day.\" The six were detained under a three-week old Army regulation that requires \"personnel with access to classified information be detained im- mediately if they extend their leave without permission.\" The Pentagon added \"that two of the soldiers went on authorized leave from their unit, the 701st Military Intelligence Brigade at Augsburg, West Germany, about two weeks ago, and never returned. At the same time, two other soldiers from the unit vanished, and officials suspected that two more who were on leave would not return.\" The military had issued a world- wide alert for the six on July 9. West German investigators were \"told that the six belong to a group known as The End of the World, but Pentagon officials said they know nothing about the group or whether it has any bear- ings on the case.\" Anytime six NSA electronic eavesdroppers belong to a group named The End of the World, I sug- gest it's time to sit up and take notice. Do they know something we don't? Now for the other shoe: The six were arrested in Gulf Breeze, Florida (my emphasis) the previous Friday night when two were stopped on a routine traffic violation for driving a van without working tail-lights. A computer check alerted the authorities, who then staged a sur- prise raid on a nearby apartment Saturday morning, as well as a local campground. Duffel bags, suitcases and briefcases, along with $4000 in cash were found in the apartment, ac- cording to Capt. Kenneth R. Hicks of the GBPD. \"The soldiers were turned over to military authorities and flown on Sunday to Fort Benning, Ga.\" The Times articles said that \"Gulf Breeze is a few miles from the sprawl- ing Pensacola Naval Air Station and the smaller Correy Station, a naval training center for electronic warfare where at least two of the soldiers had trained.\" Given tumbling walls in Europe, it seems strange that the six should have congregated back home in Gulf Breeze, under the very noses of local authorities where at least two had once trained. Now that the six are under government custody, it seems like we might have heard the last of The End of the World and why they were in Gulf Breeze anyway. Maybe they were in cahoots with the odd crew that mugged CBS an- chor Dan Rather on a New York sidewalk several years back, demand- ing to know \"What is the frequency?\" Maybe they were only trying to search out Mr. Ed's new home address? It would be nice to know if any small models of flying saucers were found in their van. Somehow, though, the really good stories never get told. In the meantime, inquiring minds like mine are piqued. If any readers have additional material or local clip- pings about this particular case (The End of the World, not Gulf Breeze), I'd appreciate receiving copies care of the Journal. - DS In Others' Words ...

A detailed account of these events can be found in the May 22 issue of NA- TIONAL ENQUIRER. The \"Anti-Matter/UFO Update\" column in the June issue of OMNI summarizes the recent re-investigation of the Roswell, N.M. UFO crash of 1947.

All of this will be covered in a book by Kevin Randle & Don Schmitt, ROSWELL, due to be pub- lished by Avon Books (paperback) in November.

Hutchings, 43, commanding officer of VX-1 at the Boca Chica Naval Air Sta- tion, Key West, Florida, said the baf- fling bright silver object seen streak- ing across South Florida and North- ern Caribbean Sea skies on the 14th was not a meteor, hinting broadly it was a man-made machine from outer space. Hutchings said the glowing, tear-shaped object was \"not made on this earth,\" and said he computed its speed at an estimated 63,000 miles per hour. By scientific computation, Hutchings said the object was 800 feet in diameter and about 40 miles above earth. At the time of the sighting, Hutchings was commander of the Navy's super-secret air develop- ment squadron at Key West, and an authority in astronomical sciences. • 1960 Five employees of the San Francisco Chemical Company watched a UFO descend from the sky over Leefe, Wyoming, at 10:30 a.m. on the first. Claude Rouse described the ob- ject as follows: \"It was bright, silver- colored, highly polished metal having the shape of two dinner plates face- to-face.\" He estimated it had a diameter of 185 feet, and 14 feet through the center. Five transparent bubbles projected from the bottom. The craft came from the south and maneuvered as if to land on the stockpile area immediately south of the Leefe plant. Mr. Rouse estimated he was about 400 feet from the vehi- cle as it vertically descended to about 50 feet above the waste dumps. It then ascended and took off to the south at tremendous speed. No sound was heard other than the idl- ing diesel engine of the tractor that Rouse was operating. • 1965 The following UFO en- counter occurred in the summer of 1965 at an American military base in Bedfordshire, England. The reporting witness was a teenager at the time: \"I was a military dependent living on a sa^llite communications base. My friend and I were playing badminton one afternoon on the base, and we were shouting and laughing when we suddenly realized we couldn't hear each other. There wasn't any sound at all. We tried to talk to each other and still couldn't hear anything. We looked around, and right above us at the top of the trees was a large, round, black object. We were just 14 and 15-year-old girls. My friend went in- side the house to get her dad and in- side the house he could hear her. When he came outside to look at 'it' we couldn't hear him talking to us, and he couldn't hear us. He went back inside and alerted the command post. \"As soon as he went back inside the house, the object started to move away over the treetops and we could hear again. The base alert sirens were sounding ... so I ran home and my father — who was senior NCO on the base — was just leaving. All of the people went 'down in the hole,' (underground). The base was closed to all traffic. My father didn't come back home until morning and I asked him what it was. He said, 'I can't tell you. All I can say is it wasn't ours.' I said, 'you mean ours-ours, or the earth's ours?' He wouldn't say any- thing else. Some years later when we were talking about it, I asked him again and he said, 'It wasn't ours. There are seven American bases around the world like the one we were on, and there were sightings at all seven that same day.' The object was about 60 to 80 feet in diameter and was tracked on the base radar.\" • On a sunny morning (date unknown), John Hembling, geologist and exploration manager for a min- ing company, and a companion geologist, stepped from a helicopter atop a mountain ridge in north-central British Columbia, Canada, about 70 miles north of Hazelton. \"It was about ten o'clock,\" Hembling said, \"when we saw a silver object, shining in the sun, appear over a small ridge below us. It had a flattened-out look ... and was about 50 feet in diameter. On top of its dome there was a little knob and around the base of the dome there were circular markings. Below these, on the face of the disc itself, there were larger rectangular marks.\" As the two men. watched in aston- ishment, the craft moved slowly across the ridge until it was above a small glacial lake, barely more than a pond. Hovering there an instant, it then descended to less than 50 feet above the water. Again it stopped, and, to the men's further amazement, lowered a pipe-like instrument from its underside into the water. \"At first we thought it was something like a rope ladder,\" Hembling said. \"But it didn't just drop down. It came out smoothly and steadily as if under mechanical control.\" During this pro- cedure the observers were conscious of a humming sound from the craft \"like a quiet electric motor.\" With its appendage in the lake, the disc then rotated slowly like a water- borne top until its \"windows\" faced the two men. \"We had a distinct feel- ing it knew we were there,\" Hembling said. After remaining in that position for about eight minutes, the craft withdrew its \"pipe\" as carefully as it had lowered it. \"It climbed slowly, then all of a sudden it was off,\" Hembling said. \"It shot over the ridge, made a sharp turn without skidding and was out of sight in about 20 seconds. We figured it had gone 20 MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 267 July 1990"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"16 or 25 miles by the time it disap- peared.\" • About 6 a.m. on the first, Mon- sieur Masse was working his lavender field northwest of Valensole, in the Department of Alpes de Haute- Provence, France, when he heard a brief whistling sound not far off. He walked in the direction from which the sound had come and saw that a strange machine had landed in his field, about 100 meters from him. He made his way towards it and soon realized that the craft, which was standing on legs, was of the shape of a rugby football and the size of a Renault Dauphine car. Beneath the vehicle were two beings, who were not men. He got to a point ten meters from them. The beings were squatting on the ground. One had its back to Masse, while the other was facing towards him. Suddenly, both of the beings got up. The one who had his back to Masse turned around and faced him, and made a gesture with his right hand. In this hand he was holding an object — which he later put into a case that he was wearing on his left side. Instantly, the witness was im- mobilized. He could feel nothing. He was neither numb nor contracted. He could neither move his head nor make any gesture. The beings were about one meter tall. They had very big heads, much bigger than the head of a man. They were completely bald. No chin. A round hole where our mouth is. Eyes resembling ours, but without eyebrows. Their skin was smooth and of a color identical with that of Euro- peans. Their shoulders were scarcely wider than their heads, and the heads were set deep into the shoulders. They had almost no neck. They had arms and legs, but the witness was not able to describe the feet and hands. They were wearing dark overalls. They appeared to be talking to each other, their eyes moved, and a sort of gurgling sound came from their throats. The bottom of the craft was 50 cen- timeters from the ground. On the top it had a transparent dome. After some four minutes or so, the two occupants climbed in. Once they were aboard, a sliding door closed, moving up- wards, like a roll-top desk. At that point Masse could see the two oc- cupants through the dome. Sudden- ly there was a muffled sound and the vehicle ascended about a meter into the air. Then the witness observed, underneath the craft, a tube, with a glint like steel, which was coming up out of the ground. The six legs of the machine started to turn and the vehi- cle started to move away like a flash of lightning. In about 15 minutes Masse's paralysis ceased. Then he went to look at the spot where the craft had stood. He discovered that the ground where it had landed was soaked with moisture. • On the third, a giant lens-shaped object was seen, tracked, and photo- graphed at the Argentina scientific base, Deception Island, in the Antarc- tic. Lt. Daniel Perisse, Commanding Officer, confirmed by radio that the large object alternately hovered, then accelerated and maneuvered at tremendous speeds. While being tracked by theodolite and watched through binoculars, the craft caused strong interference with variometers used to measure the earth's magnetic field, and also registered on magne- tograph tapes. Color pictures were taken through a theodolite by a member of a visiting group from the Chilean scientific base. (Please refer to the MUFON 1987 International UFO Symposium Proceedings for the paper titled \"Deception Island UFO Sightings\" by Capt. Daniel A. Perrisse for more details.) Confirming the reports, the Chilean Minister of Defense at Santiago added new information radioed by Comman- der Mario Janh Barrera, Commanding Officer of the Chilean base: On the 18th a similar object had maneuvered over the area, and was seen by all per- sonnel. During the sighting on the third, the object had caused strong radio interference, temporarily block- ing his attempts to report the craft to the British and Argentine bases. • 1975 A Macheke, Rhodesia man reported that he was paralyzed by a light from a UFO which hovered over his garden on the 25th. He said he was flung to the ground by a mysterious light that appeared at treetop level 10 meters from his house, and that bruises on his chest and shoulder were caused by the im- pact. John Clark, 54, said: \"I believe it was something from outer space. Judging from the hold it had on me it could have destroyed me, straight away. But I think it was examining me.\" Police confirmed that they had a report of the incident and that they had no reason to doubt his story. Clarks clash with the UFO occurred just after 7 p.m. \"I didn't feel like cook- ing so I thought I would go to the cafe at the garage for some food. I went around the side of the house and when I was about level with the bedroom window a terrific bright light came on to me. At the same time I was thrown to the ground. The cat was with me. It screeched and ran off. I went straight down, and I couldn't move. I was paralyzed, but wide awake. I tried to move my head and fingers but I could not. I even tried to roll over. I could see the reflection of the light in the bedroom. It was just as if there was a searchlight inside the room, it was so bright. \"Eventually, everything went black again,\" Clark said. \"It must have pushed off. I was able to get up and get back inside the house. When I had left the house the fire was going well, but it was out when I got back. I must have been outside for about an hour.\" Clark said that bruises on his chest and shoulder were caused by the violent impact of his fall. • Danie Van Graan, 69, is certain the thing which he saw in his sheep enclosure just outside Loxton, South Africa, was not one of the Citrus Commission's orange-colored lemon juice wagons. \"It was the morning of the 31st when, at approximately half past seven I walked across my land. The sun had not yet risen, but it was quite light and I could see the thing quite clearly. I thought it was a cara- MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 267 July 1990"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"17 van belonging to the people who are looking for uranium all around here,\" Van Graan reported. \"But as I came nearer, I saw that it was altogether round with rounded windows. I could immediately see beings who looked like people. They had rather long faces, though. There were four of them. \"Three of them, I felt, had me under their observation and the fourth was busy at an instrument panel of some sort. I could see the lights im- mediately. All of these were three cor- nered. I felt like I wanted to get closer, then, some sort of flap near one of the windows opened with a bang and a streak of light shone in my face. I felt very uncomfortable and started to bleed from my nose. From a safe distance, I observed them for about half an hour. All four were approx- imately one-and-a-half meters tall and I would guess that each one weighed between 54 and 58 kilograms. They looked just like normal people with very long faces. They also had high foreheads.\" The object then ascended and within seconds it disappeared, without making any sound. On the ground where the craft stood, there were marks in the hard dirt, each approximately two cen- timeters wide and ten centimeters long, and precisely the same distance from each other. In response to rumors that Van Graan had perpetrated a hoax, his neighbor, Mr. Sinclair said: \"If this were the case, someone would have seen him do- ing this. This is right in front of our eyes. It would have taken him a half a day. And without help he could hardly do it. He is a little on the short side, so how could he make five marks in the stone hard, dry ground, each one symmetrical and equally distant from the other. Someone would surely have come closer and inquired what the old man was up to.\" Mr. Ben Bruwer, Mr. Sinclair's business associate, said that he had seen Van Graan early that morning with his cloths smeared with blood as though his nose had been bleeding. • 1980 Alan Morris was fishing with his dog at a river near his home in Wales (city unknown), during the early morning hours of the 27th when he saw a bright, pulsating light approaching. It hovered then landed in a nearby field. When Morris went to the field he discovered a cylinder- shaped craft five feet high and six feet long standing on a tripod. An unseen door opened, a metal ladder dropped to the ground and three gray-suited figures emerged, each carrying a bucket and spade. They then pro- ceeded to dig nearby. Morris re- mained quiet, but his dog began to bark and ran towards the craft. At this point, Morris apparently lost con- sciousness and when he awoke it was daylight and his dog and the craft were gone. Upon investigating the landing area he found slight scorch marks on the ground. The dog was never seen again. WORDS, Continued rumors of crashed disk occupants having reptilian features? And how about those abduction / contact cases involving UFO occupants with \"wing- ed serpent\" insignias on their uniforms?

Fowler's sixth book on the UFO subject (including one novel) is entitled THE WATCHERS. In large part, it deals with the case of Betty Andreasson Luca, the subject of two previous books by Fowler. However, personal experiences of the author and his family are included in the book, indicating an overwhelming in- terest in the UFO subject is often more than mere intellectual curiosity. If you accept UFOs as a reality and you wonder about their purpose (s) in visiting this planet, Raymond Fowler provides a possible answer which will certainly make you stop and think, to say the least. Autographed copies of this book can be obtained directly from the author (Ray Fowler - 13 Friend Court - Wenham, MA 01984) at $20.00 per copy postpaid in the U.S. Canadian orders are $25.00 per copy; international orders are $25.00 by surface mail, $35.00 by airmail. A reminder that Howard Blum's book, OUT THERE, is set for an August release from Simon & Schuster, so check your local bookstores. This promises to be a very interesting look at government/in- telligence agency involvement in the UFO subject.

Dear Editor: A while back, Walt Andrus grac- iously extended his permission to list MUFON as the sponsor of a com- puter bulletin board devoted to UFOlogy. We are pleased to an- nounce that the board has been operational for a few months and is generating a lot of interest. MUFON Ohio State Section Direc- tors, Dale Wedge and Rick Dell' Aquila, have been serving as co- sysops of the UFOlogy \"Special In- terest Group\" [SIG] on the Case Western Reserve University spon- sored \"Freenet\" computer bulletin board which is based in Cleveland, Ohio. This is a very large system, par- tially supported by grant monies to the university, that is expanding nation- wide. Several other SIGs of interest to MUFON members are available on the system, including a Skeptics sec- tion which is operated by CSICOP members and a NASA section operated by NASA Lewis Research Center employees. There is no fee (hence, the name \"Freenet\") and anyone with a com- puter and modem can log on as a visitor, which allows exploration of the system with certain limitations. To reach the UFO SIG, enter \"go UFO\" when prompted. The system is relatively simple to use and offers free Internet and Fidonet access to members. Everyone, regardless of their views on UFOs, is invited to participate and there have been some lively debates. Freenet can be reached at (216) 368-3888 and supports 300/1200/2400 baud. We would like to hear from more MUFON mem- bers in the near future and hope that many of you will want to register and log on as regular members.

Box 29163, Cleveland, Ohio 44129. - Rick Dell'Aquila Seven Hills, Ohio Dear Editor: I found the article on the Mantell case by William E. Jones (MUFON UFO Journal, April 1990) to be an especially interesting one. The inci- dent that was the subject of his inter- view with Jack Pickering was com- pelling in its own right and lends sup- port to the view that what Captain Mantell witnessed was not a Skyhook balloon. It should be noted that when the Air Force judged Mantell incapable of distinguishing between a daytime point source of light, Venus, and an object which he described as \"gigan- tic\" (or \"tremendous\" in some ac- counts), it followed, or perhaps established, a pattern of using astronomical point sources as ex- planations of last resort. Even though Project Blue Book's chief, Captain Edward Ruppelt, and its astronomical consultant, Allen Hynek, later re- jected the Venus explanation for this sighting, the Air Force would in the future embrace point-source solutions out of desperation. Thus in the sum- mer of 1965 Blue Book attributed to twinkling stars observations through- out the central United States of rotating colors on circular lights, at least one of which was described by the witness, the Oklahoma Civil Defense Agency public information officer, as being almost the apparent size of the full moon. A well-known photograph taken the following night in Tulsa of a vir- tually identical light offers additional evidence of the size disparity and even shows the light to be part of a struc- ture. More information about the photograph can be found in an arti- cle by Walt Andrus in the Journal of December 1985. — Bob Lieser Tulsa, OK Dear Editor: I had the pleasure to serve as guest editor of the Spring 1989 ReVision issue in which Peter Rojcewicz's per- ceptive essay on the \"Men in Black\" phenomenon originally appeared. Having, now read Hilary Evans' re- sponse to the essay's appearance in the March 1990 issue of MUFON UFO Journal, I must admit I'm not sure Evans and I encountered the same essay. Then again, unless Ro- jcewicz's article is disguising itself in multiple versions (a literary dop- pleganger), it's probably safe to assume we did read the same piece, only quite differently. Particularly baffling is Evan's criticism of Rojcewicz for blurring the distinction between two kinds of belief, that of the person who ex- periences from the inside and that of a person who comments from the outside. Rojcewicz does no such thing, either directly or indirectly, by commission or omission. The percep- tive reader will recall that Rojcewicz, a folklorist by training, simply 1) sum- marizes mainstream folklore's prevail- ing commitment to evaluating anom- alous beliefs solely in terms of cultural expectations and 2) makes a per- suasive if modest call for his field to move beyond taking claims for anomalous experience \"only as repre- sentational or symbolic.\" The eccentric tenor of Evans' asser- tion is compounded when he inex- plicably segues into broad observa- tions about the vagaries of \"cultural conditioning,\" then offers an account of his having unveiled, many years ago, a rather pedestrian MIB case. These non-sequiturs in turn find friendly company in Evans' inference that Rojcewicz is somehow naive about the \"constructed\" dimensions of social and cultural realities, in- cluding anomalous realities. To the contrary: Rojcewicz's so- phistication on the complexities of perception, expectation and belief shines in a thoughtful essay, \"Signals of Transcendence\" (Journal of UFO Studies, New Series, Volume 1, 1989). Given that Evans not only wrote for the same issue but specific- ally commented on Rojcewicz's ideas MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 267 July 1990"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"19 in a second-round dialogue among contributors, I find his reponse to Ro- jcewicz's views all the more puzzling. In his MIB essay, for instance, Ro- jcewicz's himself argues for taking a tenative, provisional stance toward the \"crack in reality\" hypothesis. Evans' implication that Rojcewicz does other- wise is baseless. Finally, not withstanding Evans' ex cathedral declaration \"that in the end we shall have to decide between con- sensus reality and subjective fantasy,\" Rojcewicz stands on solid methodo- logical and epistemological ground in positing terra intermedia to account for particular UFO events. Jacques Vallee puts the matter well in Con- frontations: \"If reality is no longer restricted to three axes of space and one axis of time, the Visitors could be from anywhere and anytime.\" — Keith Thompson Aptos, CA Dear Editor: I wish to reiterate and expand upon remarks which I made at the podium of the Pensacola Civic Center, site of MUFON's International UFO Sym- posium for 1990. In 1986, Michigan MUFON hosted the symposium at Michigan State University, and I was privileged to serve as chairperson. In its aftermath, we received many compliments for the manner by which our group at- tempted to treat all attendees as VIPs. Comments to the effect of \"best ever\" were, of course, well received. It is with that backdrop that I wish to express unequivocally that the Northwest Florida MUFON con- tingent has outdone Michigan. For those who missed this extraordinary event, permit me to list a few of the exceptional preparations this year: Friday evening at the symposium has traditionally been the occasion for a reception. But separate ice sculp- tures in the form of a UFO and the MUFON logo, not to mention out- standing hors'doeuvres? And a band? As always, the speakers' list in- cluded the best and brightest in our unique business. However, the Satur- day morning session was preceded by a video that portrayed the UFO sub- ject and the Gulf Breeze events in par- ticular with a provocative collage of music and visuals. Intriguing music was likewise interspersed throughout the sessions. As an important aside, a five-bus tour of Gulf Breeze UFO sites was organized. Those fortunate enough to be on the bus with Dr. Bruce Mac- cabee and debunker Phil Klass witnessed their mutually recorded and hilarious exchange. Cordially pressed by Bruce as to whether he had per- sonally interviewed any of the witnesses in the area, Klass joined in the fun, claiming to have spoken to over 5,000 persons for several months per witness. Perhaps most important was the foresight of chairpersons Vicki Lyons and Charles Flannigan to engage the professional services of Bill Richards to handle all electronic needs. For, what transpired in the final 36 hours before the Saturday AM opening of the sessions would have stymied other host committees. Imagine being in their position when informed at that late hour that the hotel auditorium's air condition- ing system has failed and cannot be rectified in time. Then, having quick- ly secured an alternate site, but in need of major electronic enhance- ments, you make all the arrange- ments only to have the truck carry- ing the equipment involved in a serious accident that destroyed the sensitive items. No doubt with aspirin bottle in hand, Mr. Richards somehow saved the day, while other commit- tee members hastily prepared notices as to the alternate site. It is, then, from the personal ex- perience of hosting a successful sym- posium that we in Michigan reel in our egos and point to you, Florida. You were sensational. — Dan Wright Lansing, MI Dear Editor: Just a note on Erich Aggen's most stimulating article in your June issue. Mr. Aggen says that \"element 115 has the unique property of releasing an- timatter particles when subjected to proton bombardment.\" Actually, a number of materials can produce an- timatter when subjected to proton bombardment and other high energy radiations. Even some of the organo- metallic complexes in your own body could conceivably release antiparticles if given the proper jolt from incom- ing cosmic radiation. Some good material on the an- timatter propulsion schemes being researched at Edwards Air Force Base are described in Joel Davis' article in the British journal, New Scientist (June 24, 1989, p. 68). Davis sug- gests that an antimatter rocket could travel from Earth to Pluto in three weeks. In the fourth installment of his \"The UFO Impact\" series in Pursuit (No. 84), the French physicist Jean-Pierre Petit says that antihydrogen can be stored in a novel solid-state form in a crystal matrix. A little silver of this crystal could take us to Pluto, or destroy a city: it's Star Trek or Star Burst, our choice! — Daniel Eden Sallisaw, OK Army discharges six who went to Florida • FORT KNOX, Ky. The Army on Friday discharged six soldiers who left their intelligence unit in Europe and went to a Florida beach town known for frequent sightings of UFOs. The soldiers were reported missing July 9 from their post in Augsburg, West Germany, and were arrested less than a week later in Gulf Breeze, Fla. An investigation found no evidence that the soldiers from the 701st Military Intelligence Brigade had been involved in espionage during the time they were AWOL, said Maj. Ron Mazzia, a spokesman for Fort Knox, where the soldiers were detained. MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 267 July 1990"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"20 The Night Sky Walter N. Webb August 1990 Bright Planets (Evening Sky): Mars, brightening from 0 to -0.4 magnitude during the month, moves from Aries into Taurus. The red planet rises in the ENE about 11:30 PM daylight time in mid-August. Saturn (magnitude 0.2) stands low in the SE at dusk and advances westward during the night. The ringed planet is only 1.7° above the gibbous Moon on the 31st. Bright Planets (Morning Sky): Venus (-3.9) and Jupiter (-1.8) form a spectacular pair in the eastern twilight sky on August 12 and 13. At that time the two brightest planets are only half a degree apart. Venus is 7 times brighter than its giant companion. (Their separation is even closer in the Eastern Hemisphere.) On the 18th the crescent Moon passes very near Jupiter in the eastern U.S. but occults the planet completely in the central and western part of the country. The next morning the thin lunar crescent lies near Venus. And finally, after a 15-month space cruise, the Magellan probe arrives at Venus (Aug. 10) and orbits the cloud-shrouded world. Its task is to radar- map the planet's surface. Mars is high in the SSE at dawn. Saturn sets in the WSW about 3 AM in midmonth. Partial Lunar Eclipse: On the morning of August 6 observers in the far western states, Alaska, and Hawaii can view at least the early phases of a partial eclipse of the Moon, weather permitting. The farther west you are, the more of the event you will see before the Moon sets. Hawaiians will see all but the last few minutes of the entire show. The full moon slides into the Earth's central shadow (umbra) at 5:44 AM PDT and becomes 68 percent (maximum) eclipsed at 7:12. Meteor Shower: The light from a quarter Moon will wipe out some of this year's Perseid meteors which achieve their maximum during the morning hours of the 12th. The Perseids typically are very fast-moving and bright, frequently leav- ing smoky \"trains\" which may last many seconds before fading. The shower continues in lesser numbers from late July to mid-August. Moon Phases: Full moon — August 6 Last quarter — August 13 New moon — August 20 First quarter — August 28 The Stars: August evenings bring the Summer Triangle high overhead. Not a true con- stellation, this very obvious right triangle is composed of the brightest stars of three separate constellations. Vega, the third brightest star in the Northern Hemisphere, is in Lyra the Lyre or Harp. Look for a crooked rectangle. Because of the slow proces- sional wobble of the Earth's axis, Vega will be our North Star in 12,000 years. It is also the first star ever photographed (in 1850). East of Vega lies the star Deneb, the tail of Cygnus the Swan. Cygnus is often nicknamed the Northern Cross, with Deneb the top of the cross. Albireo, the head of the swan, is a spectacular blue and gold double star in a small telescope (single to the unaided eye). Altair forms the southern corner of the triangle. The star marks the head of Aquila the Eagle, the bird that car- ried Jupiter's thunderbolts. With some care, it is possible to discern two outstretched wings and a pointed tail. The eagle and swan fly in opposite directions along the Milky Way.

New Officers When one evaluates the caliber of the new officers volunteering their talents to MUFON this past month, their combined expertise exceeds the annual growth of the Midwest UFO Network in our formative years. No one could have envisioned that a small group of UFO investigators and researchers meeting in Quincy, Illinois on May 31, 1969 would grow into not only the leading UFO organization but the world's largest.

This award recognizes an individual or team's unsurpassed investigative skill during the previous calendar year in resolving a UFO claim by the public. For the first time the award does not pertain to a single case, although many of their combined investigations were among the best. From April through December of 1989, they sub- mitted case reports on 24 separate in- cidents totalling nearly 200 pages of material. Carol and Rex followed the MUFON Field Investigator's Manual explicitly in their reporting, setting a standard for proper UFO casework. Duplicate framed certificates were awarded to Rex and Carol. 1991 MUFON Symposium At the conclusion of the MUFON 1990 International UFO Symposium in Pensacola, Thomas P.

Andrus, Jr. 1990 Pensacola Symposium Speaking in behalf of everyone who attended the MUFON 1990 In- ternational UFO Symposium in Pen- sacola, Florida on July 6, 7 and 8, we want to express our thanks to the en- tire Pensacola MUFON organization for hosting one of the most successful MUFON symposia in the past 21 years. It would be impossible to recognize each and every person who contributed to the planning, imple- mentation and success of this gala an- nual event, therefore I will name on- ly the host committee heads who were directly responsible. Vicki P. Lyons, the General Chairperson, was not only the key individual responsi- ble for the most well organized MUFON symposia to date, but the person who provided fantastic leader- ship to her committees. The host committee chairpersons that must be recognized for their superb work are the following: Kathi Ware, Publicity and Technical Arrangements; Carol Salisberry, Exhibits and Vendors; Carol Ware and Patti Weatherford, Registration; Art Hufford, Finance Chairman; and Boots Eckert, Bus Tour. Individual accolades are ex- tended to everyone on the host com- mittee for the professional manner in which they handled their respon- sibilities and for being such gracious hosts and hostesses. Due to air-conditioning problems in the ballroom of the Pensacola Hilton, the Saturday and Sunday events were transferred to the beautiful Pensacola Civic Center, across the street, where the overflow crowd could be better ac- commodated to the satisfaction of over 850 attendees. After installing his visual-audio equipment in the meet- ing rooms at the Hilton, Bill Richards, the technical contractor, performed a miraculous overnight fete by moving General Chairperson Vicki P. Lyons 1990 MUFON Symposium everything to the Civic Center. New innovations were introduced into the symposium agenda for the ad- ditional enjoyment of the attendees by the host committee, that were unique to Pensacola and Gulf Breeze, and which will be difficult to equal or sur- pass in future symposia. Charles D. Flannigan is to be commended for his insight in selecting Vicki P. Lyons as the symposium general chairperson. Awards and Recognitions The plaque for the MUFON Award for the most outstanding contribution to the field of Ufology for 1989-90 was awarded to Richard H. Hall. He was also the recipient of a $500 cash award presented by the Fund for UFO Re- search in recognition for over 30 years of dedicated service to Ufology. These awards were especially significant since they represented the vote and recogni- tion of his colleagues in Ufology. Ro- bert L. Hall, Ph.D. accepted the awards on behalf of his brother Richard. The MUFON 1990 UFO Sym- posium Proceedings were respectful- ly dedicated to George R. and Shirley A. Coyne, a husband and wife team, for their outstanding leader- ship in the growth of Michigan MUFON, setting standards for recruit- ment, investigative training and abduc- tion support groups. They have utiliz- ed their talents to help other state organizations through personal visits in the Central Region, in which George is the Regional Director and Shirley is the Michigan State Director. Dan Wright, Deputy Director, had the honor and privilege of presenting MUFON's third annual award for \"Meritorious Achievement in a UFO Continued on page 23 MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 267 July 1990"}]
