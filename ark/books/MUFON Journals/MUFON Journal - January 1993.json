Our membership now stands right at 4300, and we are currently printing some 4500 copies of each issue. In addition, we initiated a new section of Readers' Classified ads which has been well-received by readers and members alike. To the best of my knowledge, we remain the only monthly UFO publication in the world. We could rest on our laurels, but we won't. In fact, you'll find some new changes in this issue, beginning with our cover redesign by Vince Johnson of Houston. Mr. Johnson, a graphics artist and member of HUFON, the Houston UFO Network, is the Journal's new Art Director, and we look forward to working with him in the improve- ment of the Journal's overall appearance in future issues. Also new is John Carpenter's column on abduction research, which will become a regular feature, probably on a bi- monthly basis. We welcome both Mr. Johnson and Mr. Carpenter to the MUFON Journal staff and masthead. Last year we also initiated a $100 award to the author of the feature article judged the best of the preceding calendar year. Our first winner was Michael Chorost. Votes for 1992 - please use a post card — are now due, and we urge you to cast yours. By voting, you not only reward our hardworking, unpaid contributors for their labors, you also help the editors determine the contents of future issues. We should point out that our regular columnists are also eligible. Exchange Copies I f there is a downside to the Journal's continuing growth it is the fact that every other UFO publication on the plan- et now wants to exchange issues with us. As a matter of pro- fessional courtesy, and as a means of keeping ourselves informed of worldwide developments, MUFON is only too happy to engage in such exchanges. However, the matter is getting slightly out of hand. For one thing, we publish 12 issues a year, whereas our colleagues generally publish only four to six copies during the same period. When postage costs are factored in, it doesn't take a rocket scientist to see that MUFON has the short end of the exchange stick. In the past, Walt Andrus has tried to keep me supplied with Xerox copies of various publications received at MUFON in Seguin, but this is no longer feasible because of the volume of publications received, including the added time and postage involved in making copies and forwarding same. In the future, then, in order to maintain your Journal exchange subscription, the editors or publishers of other UFO publications will need to make two copies of their journal available to MUFON. One copy should continue to go to Walt Andrus at 103 Oldtowne Road, Seguin, TX, 78155-4099; the second should be sent to Dennis Stacy, Box 12434, San Antonio, TX 78212. If necessary, in order to save on postage, both copies may be sent to a single address. This policy is effective immediately, and those publi- cations which fail to respond will be dropped from MUFON's exchange list. In such an event, regular sub- scriptions to the Journal are available for $25 a year, $30 overseas, surface. Classified Ads Readers and members are again advised to take advan- tage of our classified ads section as means of reaching a wide audience. Notices are limited to 50 words or less, and cost $15 for each issue of the Journal in which they appear. Acceptance is at the discretion of the Journal edi- tors, and publication in no way implies endorsement by MUFON or the MUFON Board of Directors. Caveat emp- tor! Classified ads are a public service, charged at a rate which covers processing and bookkeeping expenses. In the case of a physical product, we ask that a hard copy of same be sent to one of the editors simply to verify that such a product exists before acceptance. Editorial Policy T his is also the time of year to reiterate our editorial policy. As much as MUFON would like to guarantee the authenticity of every word published, such a practice lies outside practical reality. The opinions expressed, then, are solely those of the author(s) and should not necessarily be construed as those of the editors, MUFON or the Board of Directors, unless expressly stated as such. When feasible, individuals mentioned in a particular article are offered the opportunity of response in the same issue. Unfortunately, due to our monthly schedule, this cannot always be the case. By the same token, because we do publish monthly, any \"offended\" parties are usually granted the right of a prompt rely. Publication of material submitted to the Journal is sole- ly at the editors' discretion. The contents of any particular issue are subject to a variety of factors, not the least of which are space and timeliness. While any and all submis- sions and letters of comment are welcome, publication is not necessarily guaranteed, nor is a personal reply always pos- sible. Remember, there are only two of us, and more than 4300 of you! As MUFON grows, so, too, do the logistics of putting out the Journal every month. And while we appre- ciate your contributions, we appreciate your patience even more. In the meantime, we look forward to serving you for another year, by producing the best and most timely UFO journal money can buy. MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 297 January 1993"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Time Travelers: An Alternative to the ET Hypothesis By Vince Johnson The following hypothesis is based on these assumptions: • A percentage of UFO reports are true. • A percentage of \"alien abduction\" accounts are true. • Despite over 40 years of UFO reports, we have acquired little hard data on the nature of UFOs and their occupants. • UFOs are a material, technical phenomenon, not meta- physical or supernatural events. As someone familiar with the gamut of Ufology, I have always been struck by the sensational nature of UFO reports, combined with the paucity of hard data on the phe- nomenon. Unfortunately, the luminaries of Ufology seem to know little more about the actual nature of the phenomenon than the casual reader of supermarket tabloids. After a gen- eration of sightings, close encounters, and research by cadres of dedicated Ufologists, we are still no closer to the truth. The most vexing aspect of the UFO phenomenon is the secrecy. Most researchers suspect that the U.S. gov- ernment knows much more than they're telling. But if this is true, how can one explain the success that the government has had in keeping this historic story under a veil of secre- cy for over 40 years? Most cover-ups are ultimately exposed, but the UFO cover-up shows little sign of ever being revealed. An incoming President and his new appointees would not suffer political embarrassment due to the coverups of their predecessors, especially if they were of different political parties. Someone in high office would have been briefed at some point on this phenomenon, and surely not all could be expected to suppress this story. One could surmise that either UFO information is compartmental- ized even from the President and his cabinet (in the words of Ollie North \"...an independent off-the-shelf operation,\" free from scrutiny or oversight by our elected officials) or else nobody in the government has any idea what's going on regarding UFOs. To me, the information blackout surrounding UFOs could only be achieved with the acquiescence, if not the active participation, of our Visitors. We've all read the abduction accounts where the Visitors can materialize through solid walls, induce para- hypnotic states in abductees and witnesses, and create false screen memories of the event. It could very well be that our Visitors actually prevent any revelation of UFO information through fear and intimidation of just a few well-placed political, military, or intelligence personnel, or be deleting the knowledge of Visitor activity through some sophisti- cated psycho-neural technique, possibly involving the implants reported so often by abductees. Whatever the method, it is likely that this story could not be successfully contained without the active participation of our Visitors. Why would our Visitors feel the need for secrecy? If abduction accounts are to be believed, they can come and go at will, and do whatever they want to whomever they want, whenever they want. It is possible that the UFO phenome- non represents a metaphysical process that we as organic, material beings are incapable of understanding, and that our government is just as mystified as the rest of us. But I think there is a theory that could go far in explaining many of the puzzling aspects of the phenomenon. The Visitors could be humans (or their robot/cyborg agents) from a distant future. The two primary reasons that I think this may be a viable explanation are the apparent harvesting of human genetic samples (and hybrid fetuses) during abduction events, and the Visitors' apparent desire for secrecy. N ature has always been a cruel but efficient monitor of human evolution, promoting constant, minutely incre- mental improvements in the species. Individuals with defects or mutations that detracted from their survivability did not live to reproduce those changes. Individuals whose mutations enhanced their survivability reproduced and passed those changes along to the gene pool. As medical technology improves, natural selection becomes less of an evolutionary factor. It is easy to imagine that after a few thousands years of breeding without the quality-control mechanism of natural selection that a species, including Homo sapiens, could lose its genetic viability. Eugenics (or selective breeding to strengthen certain genetic traits) has long been practiced by farmers and cattle ranchers, but has been reviled when considered for use in the human species and generally equated with the atrocities of Nazi extermination camps. Considering the revulsion that the subject currently engenders, it may be that our Visitors waited until it was too late for a selective breeding program and have had to begin a more radical program to acquire viable genetic material - from their past. Interestingly, the scale of the Visitors' efforts may pro- vide a clue to their true motivations. The number of genet- ic specimens taken by our Visitors would seem too large for a purely academic study of the human organism. The huge number of abduction cases (up to 2% of the population by Vince Johnson, the Journal's new Art Director, is not only a graphics artist of exceeding skill, but an accomplished writer as well, as evidenced by the above article, reprinted with the permission of HUFON Report, the newsletter of the Houston UFO Network. MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 297 January 1993"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"some estimates) could indicate that a planet-wide genetic engineering project is underway somewhere, or sometime. If the Visitors are time travelers from the future, it could explain their apparent need for secrecy. Time-travel paradoxes are a staple of science fiction. You go back in time, accidentally cause some small change to come about in the past, and that small change affects the future with unpredictable and possibly cataclysmic results. Changes that could cause time-paradox effects would be of three types; intervention, artifacts, and information. Being abducted from one's bed at night and returned with no con- scious memory of the event is an intervention, but if there is no valid information received, possible time-paradox effects could be minimal. If an artifact were recovered from a time traveling UFO from the future, it would not necessarily be the artifact itself, but the information gleaned from it, that could disrupt the linear flow of time. T he Visitois have been very successful in limiting the amount of hard data that we are able to acquire about them. The descriptions of UFOs (size, shape, color, etc.) are about as diverse as the witnesses who observe them. The resulting inconsistencies of reports may be by design. It is obvious to anyone familiar with UFO contactee accounts that the Visitors seem to go out of their way to further con- fuse the issue. The myriad descriptions of the entities them- selves, and the bogus platitudes, prophesies, purposes, and places of origin that they reportedly communicate to con- tactees hinder any attempt to correlate the data. The Visitors could be deliberately adding so much \"noise\" that the \"signal\" is lost. Many abductees/contactees have described the Visitors as being \"robot like.\" Perhaps this is true. Using robots to interact with human subjects could be much safer for them. Should any of these entities ever be captured, they could be programmed to reveal no information, and to even self- destruct into a protoplasmic goo before any analyses could be begun on a specimen. Anecdotal accounts of UFOs and their occupants may tantalize and intrigue us, but we (as private researchers) have not yet acquired any significant confirmable, scientif- ically validated information about the events. Again, much noise, no signal. If this hypothesis is correct, our Visitors must maintain a total information blackout to protect their present (our future) from unpredictable and possibly cata- clysmic changes. There could be a direct correlation between how much we actually know about the Visitors and the probability of time-paradox effects. This hypothesis addresses some of the fundamental mysteries of the UFO phenomenon, however, there are several questions left unanswered: 1. If the Visitors are capable of time travel, why take genetic samples at this stage of human cultural/technical development? If secrecy needs to be preserved, why not take samples from modem Homo sapiens during the pre- historic era? After all, modern mass communications make the possibility of public awareness of the Visitors' activity much more likely today than during the Stone Age. Could the current state of human development rep- resent a balance between genetic vigor and domesticity? 2. Why would the possessors of such super technology not be able to simply genetically alter any organisms at will? Could they need some metaphysical or spiritual quality not obtainable through synthetic genetic engineer- ing? 3. Since we are able to obtain limited anecdotal informa- tion about the Visitors, could this mean there is some threshold of information that we can acquire without trig- gering time-paradox effects? 4. Reports of UFO crash retrievals such as the Roswell incident would tend to conflict with the time-travel hypothesis. On the other hand, while the eyewitness reports and the Army's initial press release are fairly con- vincing, there is still no hard, irrefutable evidence avail- able (at least to non-governmental investigators) that the Roswell crash ever occurred. D o I believe the time travel hypothesis? Not necessarily. I haven't got a clue as to answers for the questions listed above. All I have tried to do is construct a theory based on what little we do know of the UFO phenomenon. One fact seems irrefutable, however; whether UFO occu- pants are time travelers, extraterrestrials, or some type of incomprehensible metaphysical/interdimensional entities, they clearly want to limit the amount of information we can glean about them. By overwhelming the \"signal\" with \"noise,\" they have been all too successful in that regard. I don't accept the theories that the visitors are here to conquer us, enslave us, use us for food, etc. These objectives would be simple for any species with the super technology exhibited by our Visitors. So far, they apparently want to accomplish their mission with as little interaction with us as possible. The time-travel scenario is at least a rational explanation for the inconsistencies in the data concerning the UFO phenomenon, the events described by abductees, and the apparent information blackout by our government and the Visitors themselves. Then again, what is rational for our Visitors may be total nonsense to us.

Although not frequently stated, it should also be noted that a number of people are aware of abduction experiences who feel neither a strong need to pursue further information nor any sense of trauma which would require therapeutic relief. These people have privately found ways to cope on their own and have been able to work through any sense of victimization. Everybody copes a little differently; not everyone needs to uncover details to feel okay and move forward. Many of these folks do not get referred for help; we hear from those who are sleepless, confused, hurting, and needing relief. It is important to remind readers of this so that it will not be assumed that all participants in this phenomenon require the following suggestions. We must respect each person's abil- ities for coping and assist each one in finding a comfortable pace in which to deal with these bizarre matters. As researchers we must remember that any eagerness for data is secondary to the necessary adjustment and heal- ing in each human life. If a participant in this phenomenon decides to only have a session once every six months, then their request is upheld with great respect. Any need for more data from the researcher's perspective simply must wait. For some researchers the notion that the \"lab rats\" can call the shots will indeed be frustrating. Let us remember that our fellow humans are asking for help. Their emotion- al needs shall effect our course of action until their satis- faction is met. In the excitement over the fascinating data, this can be easily forgotten. The process of coping can be a long journey with many highs and lows emotionally. The initial clinical picture is descriptive of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder: insomnia, anxiety, phobic or paranoid responses to seemingly harmless environmental cues, hypervigilance, irritability, nightmares, and flashbacks. Many feel that they must be going crazy and are fearful of letting anyone know - let alone have a pro- fessional validate their supposed insanity. Others say they would actually prefer psychiatric diagnosis because then there could be a prescribed treatment and a greater likeli- hood for relief. Assuming for the moment that there are no psychiatric causes for these feelings, these individuals simply need a sensitive, caring, open-minded person with whom to share their \"crazy thoughts\" which have a persistent, nagging quality to them. Unloading these peculiar feelings in an atmosphere of acceptance is essential. Just listen! It is best not to have a theory or any speculative \"explanation\" ready; they must eventually decide for themselves what they believe. Feeding them information from outside of their experiences may color, distort, or confuse their efforts to process, understand, and cope effectively. Many people have told me that they had held-in many of their feelings and unnerving memories for years because they simply did not know whom they could trust not to laugh at them. In a number of families it has become a \"family secret\" that nobody would share with each other until perhaps years later! The final decision for when or if to use hypnotic regres- sion for periods of \"missing time\" related to UFO events must remain with the client; hypnosis is most effective when the abductee is ready and wants to proceed. Often another family member, friend, or even researcher pushes for hypnosis, and it is often too soon and too frightening yet for this professional and personal intrusion. Blocking or denial may occur, misleading others to believe that no expe- rience actually occurred. Greater anxiety may develop if such a premature push creates unexpected conflict or tension within their emotions. T he hypnotherapist needs to assert some professional caution to those who view hypnosis as a \"magic door- way to all answers\" and are overly eager to explore any and all peculiar dreams or potentially unrelated but similar inci- dents in their lives. These sessions could be ripe for con- fabulatory data to occur, especially if there are no clinical symptoms such as anxiety or insomnia to resolve and the individual is simply curious and eager for some kind of answers. The hypnotherapist must help the client understand these cautions and facilitate wise decisions based on the considerations of each case. For example, a stranger called me last week, claiming that he had had an odd dream and wanted to schedule hypnosis with me to find out what it meant. This is clearly when an education is needed regard- ing the need for and uses of hypnosis. The hypnotic sessions which tend to produce the more successful and beneficial results are those which focus either on emotionally charged memory fragments or anxiety producing blocks of memory for specific periods of time. The emotions are bubbling up to the surface in these situa- tions and are usually easier and more beneficial to retrieve along with the specific content connected with the feel- ings. Participants in this bizarre UFO abduction scenario are most bothered by: (1) a sense of unexpected , uninvited, or unwanted intrusion, (2) anxiety from being out of control, (3) feeling helpless and powerless, (4) bewilderment and frustration over the usual lack of explanation provided for MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 297 January 1993"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"the events, and (5) anger over the inability to stop further intrusions. During hypnotherapy there are opportunities for the use of cathartic and abreactive techniques which can safely release a great deal of the emotional tension much in the same manner pressure is released from a pressure cooker. The state of hypnosis can be a powerful tool in enhancing this process. For example, there are points at which the abductee is overwhelmed with feelings of anger or fear. At these moments the hypnotherapist can \"freeze the action,\" stop the progression of events artificially, and directly request the abductee to envision some sort of immo- bilization of the beings —perhaps trapped behind glass, a \"force field,\" or under some type of paralysis where the abductee can at least believe temporarily that the roles have reversed. Now the abductee can safely vent his feelings of anger and confusion onto the magically-restrained aliens, stating feelings, shouting, or cursing the intruders if he so chooses. Although both the hypnotherapist and client know that this is a created, artificial scene, it nevertheless is high- ly effective in releasing pent-up feelings by utilizing the power of suggestion and the vivid quality of the hypnotic state of mind. Similarly, if we were to dream of beating up an old nemesis, we will likely awaken feeling refreshed, smugly content, and energized — as if we had actually gained revenge against an old foe — despite our conscious knowledge that nothing of the sort has actually happened. If direct visual confrontation is too difficult for the client, one can use powerful metaphoric imagery to create symbolic scenarios and significant emotional release. For example, one could be told that all of the strange beings are contained inside of a large leather bag and cannot escape. One can; then take a large club and beat the squishy bag until it is as flat as a pancake or pulverized into small particles that one could simply blow away with a breath of air or suck up into a vacuum cleaner easily. The subject's mind will know what feels right and is satisfying via fantasy. U sually one can reassure and remind the abductee that no deliberate hostility or harm has been imparted, and that he/she is a survivor with many strengths. Most confu- sion or fear does diminish with the acquisition of more information which slowly transforms the unknown into the known which we can begin to sort and process. After hypnotherapy another technique is to actually write a letter to the beings. This provides another safe out- let for expression of suppressed feelings without public display or disclosure. The tone could range from an angry blast to one of sincere inquiry listing many of those nagging questions such as, \"Why me?,\" \"Are you returning again?,\" and \"What do you need me for?\" Although the abductee does not receive answers (usually!), it helps one to process and organize his/her thoughts and release them to paper where they can remain. An ongoing journal is quite helpful for continued pro- After the initial acceptance there often occurs what I call the \"second trauma,\" when the abductee finds himself alone in a world that does not accept the original trauma as a real event cessing and working through a type of grieving. This \"grief,\" I believe, is over the loss of one's former sense of reality and the forced adjustment to a new view of one's entire existence and purpose. Committing these feelings to a letter or journal helps clear the client's mind and for- mulate some organization of the experiential components. The stages of denial, anger, depression, bargaining, and acceptance outlined by Elizabeth Kubler-Ross in her research on death and dying are indeed relevant to what the abductee finds himself working through. A fter an initial and private acceptance of the abduction phenomenon, there often occurs what I shall term the \"second trauma.\" This involves the abductee finding him- self alone in a world that does not accept the idea of the first trauma as a real event. There can be cruel teasing and insensitive jokes springing from the disbelief of best friends, family members, bosses, and coworkers. A terrible sense of aloneness and depression can occur. This can turn into dis- placed anger toward the researcher. No matter how caring the researcher or therapist can be, the client seems to reap greater assistance and comfort from hearing another abductee at this sensitive and lonely point in the process. Unfortunately, in many areas of the country there aje absolutely no support groups. A phone network has pro- duced incredible satisfaction and significant relief as the therapist and researcher work as a team to connect strug- gling newcomers with other participants who have already worked through many phases of the coping process and are able to assume a strong helping role as emotionally supportive persons. The emphasis is not on the swapping of stories, but rather on the ways to move forward and fit this bizarre scenario into an already disrupted daily routine. The integration of these opposing realities is not an easy task, but the best suggestions seem to come from those who have found various ways to cope effectively. The sig- nificant success of such phone calls and letter sharing is an important indication that these traumas are as real as a rape or death. People would not be able to connect so well and gain so much relief if these events were merely delusional or fantasized. Despite vast differences in backgrounds and interests, abduction participants come together emotionally as well as any other diverse group of humans who find themselves sharing a common trauma. Eventually, enough abduction participants may come forth in a given locale to begin a support group in that area. The most important function of such a group is to be able to gather together and feel \"normal\" again, socializing MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 297 January 1993"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"with others in an accepting atmosphere and realizing that others can truly have the same exact fears, frustrations, and confusion and yet be \"normal\" and perhaps even fun people with which to have stimulating conversations and pleasant relaxing evenings. The main caution for such groups concerns that com- mon yet devastating debate over whether the beings have either good or evil intentions. Everybody has a right to his/her feelings and own opinions; there is nothing gained from trying to convince someone that their feelings are wrong or misperceived. This only creates a great deal of hurt and resentment. The same results notoriously occur with religious or political debates; there are no absolute right answers, just strong and very emotional opinions. In my own research I have noted that the same basic components and descriptions repeat without a great deal of variance. An individual's reaction seems more related to his or her personality rather than to something of any appre- ciable difference in the recalled events themselves. For example, if you sent 50 individuals to see the same movie at a theater, you would find a variety of reactions to the exact same stimuli; each person will focus on different aspects, remember different things, and form opinions based on his/her way of perceiving the data in the movie. Each is likely to respond differently in accordance with the range of life experiences already collected and inte- grated into each respective personality. Therefore, I suggest that the differences in the beliefs are largely a product of the individual's perceptual mindset and emotional predisposition rather than an actual vari- ance of any significance in the experience itself. In other words, it seems there is a wider range of personal reactions than actual variance in the reported details of the abduction scenario. Support groups should remain supportive and socially healthy — not forums for heated and hurtful debates. Please give these considerations some careful thought. I look forward to sharing more therapeutic ideas with our readers in future columns. Please feel free to write and share your own suggestions and creative techniques.

Order From: MUFON, 103 Oldtowne Rd., Seguin, TX 78155-4099 On December 26, 1992, Thomas P. Stults (Stelle, IL), State Director for Illinois, quietly passed away after suffering from emphysema for the past few years. Tom and his wife Judy were host chairpersons for the MUFON 1991 International UFO Symposium in Chicago. In spite of his deteriorating health at that time, Tom and Judy were instrumental in conducting a high- ly successful symposium. Mr. Stults joined MUFON in December 1983 and was promoted to State Director in August 1988. Under his guidance and leadership, the membership in Illinois has more than doubled. In addition to his wife, Judith (Judy), Tom leaves three daughters and two grandchildren. The funeral was performed by Toom Funeral Home in Downers Grove, Illinois, on December 29, 1992. The family requested that flowers not be sent, however they have set up a memorial fund in the name of Thomas P. Stults, at the Herscher Bank. Herscher, Illinois 60941, which will be given to three charitable organizations. Speaking for everyone in MUFON that knew Tom personally, we are going to miss his conge- nial personality and enthusiastic approach to Ufology and the Mutual UFO Network. Judy has been an extremely strong lady during Tom's illness and is grateful that his suffering has been termin- ated. Our prayers have been extended to Judy and Tom's family as they endeavor to carry on without their beloved husband and father. MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 297 January 1993"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"Ed Walters, The Model and Tommy Smith ByArtHufford MUFON State Section Director for Escambia/Santa Rosa Counties, Florida Introduction O n June 10, 1990, the Pensacola News Journal ran a story announcing that a UFO model had been found in the attic of Ed Walters' former residence. One week later, ,the newspaper announced that a Gulf Breeze teenager, later identified as Tommy Smith, had helped Walters hoax the UFO photos. On June 19, Charles Flannigan, MUFON State Director for Florida, announced MUFON was reopening the Walters' case to investigate these new allegations. He assigned then State Section Direc- tors, Rex and Carol Salisberry, to assist him in this investi- gation. When the Salisberrys failed to deliver a complete report on the allegations (as outlined by MUFON's Deputy Direc- tor of Investigations, Dan Wright), the MUFON Chief In- vestigator for Escambia and Santa Rosa Counties, Gary Watson, was assigned to the task. Watson completed his in- vestigation and submitted his report on May 23, 1991; his report was 29 pages long with 27 attachments. The follow- ing paragraphs summarize the central facts brought out in Watson's investigation. The Model In late December 1988, Ed Walters moved to a new home to escape the attention of curiosity seekers. The residence he had occupied at 612 Silverthom Road was put up for sale. The home remained vacant for 10 months, until it was purchased by Mr. Robert E. Menzer. In March 1990, Menzer was trying to find a shutoff valve on the water supply to his kitchen, so he could hook up a new ice maker. This search led him into the attic, where he found a UFO model under insulation and next to the water line to the kitchen. On June 4, 1990, a Pensacola News Journal reporter, Craig Myers, interviewed Menzer and asked a number of questions, including: \"Did you find any models of UFOs, anything like that?\" Menzer showed Myers the model, which Myers borrowed and from which he published the story. Conclusions on Model Watson's investigation concluded the model was not constructed before September 1989, at least 8.5 months after Walters had moved out of the home. Furthermore, close examination of the model and Walters' photographs did not show any exact match of markings, height/width ratios, etc. Watson's final conclusion: The Model was built and planted by persons unknown in an attempt to discredit Ed Walters. The following chronological events are significant: • November 11,1987 - May 1,1988: Walters takes his UFO photos. • Late December 1988: Walters moves to a new home. • September 6-7, 1989: Walters designs a custom home for Mr. and Mrs. Lynn C. Thomas. The home is to be built on the corner of Shoreline Drive and Jamestown Drive in Gulf Breeze. The home is to have 1740 sq. ft. of living area, with a 2393 sq. ft. slab. Walters recommends brick exterior for the home and estimates the construction cost based on brick. The Thomases consider using white Sinergy (stucco) in- stead of brick to reduce the cost. The Thomases take a small sketch of the house plan with them back to their home in Michigan. • Mid-September 1989: Walters has completed construc- tion drawings of the house and has had them blueprinted, when the Thomases call to cancel plans to build the home. Instead, they put down $2,000 on another house Walters has already built. Once it is clear that the house will not be built, Walters discards the custom plans. • October/November 1989: The former Walters residence is sold and the Menzers move in. • March 1990: Mr. Menzer discovers the UFO model. The model was made out of plastic foam plates and a strip of blueprint paper. The inside surface of the paper strip sug- gests it was once a part of a plot plan for a home. The following words and numbers were printed within this section of the drawing; the letters in parentheses are added guesses as to what was probably a part of the original drawing.

(Walters is a successful homebuilder in Gulf Breeze.) However, a search of floor plans of homes Walters had built failed to locate one with the same 1740 sq. ft. living area and 2393 sq. ft. slab. Walters then remembered designing a home for a Michigan couple, Mr. and Mrs. Lynn C. Thomas, but it was a home that was never built. Subsequent checks with the Thomases revealed they still had the preliminary sketch of the floor plan, with notations that the living area would be 1740 sq. ft. and slab 2393 sq. ft. A copy of the sketch and a note from Mr. Thomas was included in Watson's reports. Thus, it became apparent that the Thomas house plans discarded in September 1989 were used to construct the model. By using plans designed by Walters, the persons responsible hoped to link Walters to the model, but were undone by the September 1989 design date. Detractors have tried to argue that the model was built from plans for a home Walters built for the Folkers family at 712 Jamestown Drive. However, those plans show a living area of 1696 sq. ft. and a slab of 2178 sq. ft. Not only do these square feet not match up, but neither do any of the floor plan lines match those found within the model. Since no known copies of the detailed Thomas plans exist, we can not make such a direct comparison with the model. Tommy Smith On June 15, 1990, Tommy Smith was interviewed by telephone by Gulf Breeze Mayor, Ed Gray; Gulf Breeze Police Chief, Jerry Brown; Pensacola News Journal re- porter, Craig Myers; and Channel 3 TV reporter, Mark Curtis. The interview and unsworn testimony was tran- scribed by Court Reporter, Chris Morrow. This interview was the basis for the News Journal story published two days later on June 17. In this interview, Smith offers explanations for many of the photographs and events surrounding Ed Walters. He claims Walters talked to him about the stunt and answered Smith's questions on how various photos were taken. However, on closer examination, Tommy Smith's state- ments do not satisfactorily explain anything. He also ap- pears to contradict himself in one important area. When all the evidence was examined, it was concluded that: \"Tommy Smith's statements do not add up!\" The basis for this conclusion is documented in the following paragraphs. \"Ed Said\" Statements Virtually everything Tommy Smith had to say was based on what \"Ed told me.\" Smith states he was not present when any of Ed's published photographs were taken. He states he did witness some UFO hoaxing sessions, but none of the photos from these sessions were ever published. The following are examples of what Smith says Ed told him: 1. The \"blue beam\" photos were made by slowly peeling back the back of the film and exposing it to light. (Photo analysts and film manufacturers all say this is an impossible explanation.) 2. The circle of dead grass found in the school soccer field behind Walters' home was made by Ed turning a trampoline upside down and jumping on it for several hours. (Experts say this would be an impossible method for creating the circle in which grass would not grow for 18 months.) 3. Ed had no idea how the tree limb blocked part of the UFO in photo #1. \"He was just stunned by it.\" (Pho- toanalysts have tried unsuccessfully to duplicate this feat with color Polaroid film, and believe it is impossible without sophisticated equipment.) 4. The Nimslo Camera photos (#25-34 in the book) were taken by holding the camera sideways and photographing an airplane at night. (These photos actually show three rows of horizontal lights with a short vertical light bar on one end. We are unaware of any airplane with a light pattern similar to the Nimslo photos. Secondly, turning the camera side- ways would not fit unless the plane were in a nose dive.) 5. The video tape of the UFO was made by attaching the UFO on the end of a long piece of PVC pipe painted black. A flashlight was shone up through the pipe to illuminate the UFO. (Analysis of the video tape shows no evidence of anything blocking the view of the illuminated base of the UFO, which was also rotating at 7.5 rpm.) I could go on and one with these \"Ed Said\" statements, but space limitations and your interest do not permit. The fact is that most of the 35 pages of this transcripted interview describe things that Ed supposedly said in Smith's presence or in answer to his questions. We also find it hard to believe that Ed would be that trusting of a teenager who was not a close friend or acquaintance to anyone in the Walters family. Tommy Smith's UFO Photographs Tommy Smith had in his possession a series of UFO photographs, supposedly taken on his own camera by Ed Walters. Tommy claims he witnessed Walters take one roll of photos using a double exposure technique. However, Smith claims these photos did not turn out and Ed suppos- edly burned them. Smith claims he left his camera with Ed, who took another set of UFO photos, which Smith had developed at University Mall. When Smith supposedly MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 297 January 1993"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"changed his mind about taking them to the Sentinel newspa- per, Smith claims Ed allowed him to keep the photos and the negatives. Incidentally, Smith's photos have been analyzed by photo analysts, and they find no proof of double expo- sures, suggesting these may also be authentic photos of a UFO. An interesting sidenote is that Smith talks in length during his June 15 interview about how Ed supposedly took double exposures, using a small Kodak Instamatic type of camera. However, with the exception of the 35mm Nimslo camera supplied by MUFON, Walters took all of his UFO photos with Polaroid cameras. The only UFO photos taken on Instamatic 110 film were the six UFO photos in Tommy Smith's possession. Tommy apparently felt it was important to establish an explanation for his UFO photos. Incidentally, neither Tommy Smith, nor any of the debunkers, have ever come up with an explanation of how Walters could take double exposures using the Sun 600 Polaroid cameras, which he used in all of the self-referencing, stereo photos. Tommy Smith Contradiction on the \"Road Shot\" Another damaging piece of evidence against Tommy Smith comes from a possible contradiction in his statements about the \"Road Shot\" (photo #19 in Ed Walters' book). Let me first quote from the transcripts (note: at the time of this interview, Tommy Smith's identity was protected by using the pseudonym, Chris): Mark Curtis: \"Chris (i.e., Tommy Smith), do you know ... probably the most famous shot of all, this is that one out over the road on Sound Side Drive. Do you know how that picture was done?\" Smith: \"Yes, Ed said he had a lot of trouble with that one. He just fabricated it like all the other ones... double expo- sure.\" Curtis: \"Do you know how he illuminated the road- way?\" Smith: \"Illuminated the roadway? Okay, I would have to see the photograph, to be sure.\" Curtis: \"If I can refresh your memory a little bit, it was the one over the road on Sound Side Drive, and not only was the object there, but there was a bright light reflecting onto the middle of the roadway.\" Ed Gray: \"And the light looked like it was emanating from the object that's hovering over the road.\" Smith: \"No, I don't think I could help you there, for sure. Curtis: \"Do you know if Ed had help on that picture, or did he do that one alone?\" Smith: \"I couldn't answer that honestly either.\" Thus, from the above testimony on June 15, 1990, Tommy Smith first acknowledges he is familiar with the \"Road Shot.\" However, as soon as the questioning gets into details, such as the illumination, Smith starts backpedalling and indicates he knows little or nothing at all about this photo. However, in an interview published in the August 9, 1990 Sentinel, Smith seems to be very familiar with this shot. In this article, Smith claims \"Ed told me\" that he had found the perfect place, that \"he said he was gonna go down there, pull his truck off to one side, jerk it back onto the road and head back down there. It (the UFO) was supposed to land in front of him and that was going to be the final encounter.\" For one who knew so little about this photo on June 15, Smith seems to have a lot to say a few weeks later. Was Smith just unable to understand which photo was being discussed on June 15, or had he not done his homework well enough to have an answer ready on Photo 19? You can draw your own conclusion. Why Would Tommy Smith Make This All Up? Many people have asked this question, and lacking a good answer, have assumed Smith must be telling the truth. We have no way to investigate Smith's motives ... only Tommy Smith can answer that, and he is not available for questioning. We know that he did have in his possession photos and negatives showing a UFO similar to Ed Walters' photographs. We know, too, that in December 1987, Ed Walters told MUFON Investigators Charles Flannigan and Don Ware that a young acquaintance had also taken photos of a similar UFO. Walters said this young person would not take his photos to the Sentinel because he was concerned about his father's reaction. Ironically, Walters protected the identity of this young person (Tommy Smith) until Smith made his charges public. We also know that one of Tommy Smith's young friends told Investigator Gary Watson that \"Tommy Smith told him in 1987 that he (Smith) had taken photographs of a UFO.\" We also recognize that all of Smith's statements regard- ing Walters' published photographs are just hearsay (\"Ed told me\"); when those statements do not add up, Smith can always just claim: \"I'm not lying, that is just what Ed told me.\" We know Walters has taken and passed four Poly- graph/PSE tests, administered by three different polygraph operators. If we could just lock up all the players in this drama in a room full of polygraph experts, we could proba- bly get answers to our questions, but that is not to be. (Tommy Smith refuses to face Ed Walters and the prime investigators.) MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 297 January 1993"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"Final Conclusions on the Ed Walters Case Gary Watson's reinvestigation of the Ed Walters case also dealt with some of the other issues surrounding this case, but time and your interest do not permit going any further. Watson's reinvestigation found no basis for reject- ing the original MUFON conclusion ... that Ed Walters is telling the truth. Since Watson's report was published, there have been additional photo analyses done by William Hzyer and Jeff Sainio. Although Hzyer has excellent equipment and exper- tise, he was hampered in his work by never having access to any of the original Walters photos. On the other hand, Jeff Sainio not only had excellent equipment and expertise, but he also had access to the original photos, which Hyzer did not. Although Sainio originally set out to prove Walters' photographs were fake, he soon encountered evidence that Ed Walters could not have generated his photographs with his equipment and the double exposure techniques sug- gested by debunkers. If you missed Sainio's presentation at the 1992 MUFON UFO Symposium, be sure to read his paper in the Symposium Proceedings. It is excellent work and clearly rejects the explanations offered by debunkers and Tommy Smith. Thus, it is still my conclusion, as the current State Section Director for the Walters case, that \"Ed Walters' UFO photographs, and his accompanying story, must still be accepted as the truth.\" CONCLUSION BY MUFON ON THE REOPENING OF THE WALTERS CASE by Walter H. Andrus, Jr., International Director D ue to the importance of the Ed Walters' case (N.W. FL case number 15), the MUFON Board of Direc- tors at their annual corporate meeting on July 12, 1992, in Albuquerque, New Mexico, felt that it was impera- tive that a condensed final report be publ ished in the MUFON UFO Journal on the reopening of the case after the disclo- sure of the model and the public allegations by Tommy Smith in 1990. At the recommendation of Charles D. Flannigan, Flor- ida State Director, to the MUFON International Director, a private meeting was held in Pensacola, FL on July 5, 1990, in which Rex and Carol Salisberry accepted the assignment and responsibility to investigate the validity of the recent news media public allegations which cast serious doubts upon the integrity of Ed Walters. Mr. Salisberry agreed to accept this assignment only on the condition that Walt Andrus would be willing to accept the case as a hoax provided that Salisberry's evidence supported that conclu- sion. After receiving an affirmative reply to this stipulation, it was agreed by Mr. Salisberry and Mr. Flannigan that no public statements would be issued until a final report was submitted to the International Director. Despite the \"gentlemen's agreement\" on the confiden- tiality of the final report, Rex Salisberry released his own negative preliminary report to the Pensacola News-Journal and Gulf Breeze Sentinel within two months. However, he did not submit his actual final report until nearly two years later. After Mr. Salisberry's preliminary report was pub- lished in the Pensacola News-Journal, it was evident that he was attempting to imply that the Walters case was a possible hoax. I made repeated requests to Rex Salisberry over the year to complete and submit his final report. When it became apparent to Mr. Flannigan and myself that Mr. Salisberry might not fulfill his obligation, Charles Flannigan requested that Gary Watson, Chief Investigator for Pensacola-MUFON, conduct an independent and concurrent investigation. Gary submitted his detailed final report promptly to Mr. Andrus at the Chicago MUFON UFO Symposium on July 5, 1991. The length of both Mr. Watson's and Mr. Salisberry's final reports rival a monograph or book and thus could not be published in their entirety in the Journal. Since Rex Salisberry has already distributed his preliminary and final reports to people he thought would be sympathetic to his hoax hypothesis, there are no plans to publish his paper unless he should decide to write a condensed version as Art Hufford has done. We have been publishing articles about the Ed Walters' experiences and photos in the MUFON UFO Journal since January 1988 after my first visit to Gulf Breeze. Dr. Bruce Maccabee first published a major rendition of his evaluation in the MUFON 1988 International UFO Symposium Proceedings with numerous subsequent follow-ups in both the Journal and the 1990 Proceedings. The book The Gulf Breeze Sightings by Ed and Frances Walters is an excellent reference book depicting the events in their lives starting on November 11, 1987, and continuing through May 1, 1988. Jeff Sainio will continue photo analyses on Ed's pictures and share his evaluations in both the Journal and the 1993 Symposium Proceedings. After a full five years, it is imperative that an official statement should be published regarding the authenticity of the Ed Walters' case based upon the investigation of the Mutual UFO Network. No other case in recent UFO history has polemicized the UFO community any more than this one, both vehemently positive and negative. On the one hand there are uninformed people who place the Walters' case in the same category as George Adamski and Edward \"Billy\" Meier, whereas others who have been directly in- volved in the investigation and have the facts and evidence are very comfortable in proclaiming it as one of the strongest MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 297 January 1993"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"are very comfortable in proclaiming it as one of the strongest UFO cases in recent times. I am fully cognizant that there may be one or more members on the MUFON Board of Directors who have serious reservations about the Walters' Gulf Breeze case, thus a statement from the Board is obviously not unanimous. We respect the right of these distinguished members to dissent or \"to agree to disagree.\" To be fair to Journal readers and our members, we have been publishing various viewpoints on this controversial case, provided that they were constructive evaluations and not slanderous. The best talents within the Mutual UFO Network were brought to bear upon the resolution of this project. At the same time, the debunkers and those who thought \"it was too good to be true\" garnered their forces to challenge the integrity and truthfulness of Ed Walters. The latter have failed to achieve their mission. With all respect to Rex Salisberry and his fine past record as an investigator, his final report on the Walters- Gulf Breeze Case was very detailed, but posed more ques- tions than it answered. It is interesting that two different investigators could interview the same people, but render contradictory impressions. May I express the appreciation of MUFON to both Rex Salisberry and Gary Watson for their very comprehensive reports and also to Art Hufford for the condensed narration of Mr. Watson's reports. Numerous still photographs and nearly two hours of videotape segments have been made in the Gulf Breeze area during the past four years of unusual lights behaving in various unique ways which investigators have been unable to identify. Mr. Salisberry does not question these latter events since multiple witnesses were present during each sighting. The issue being addressed is the authenticity of the photographs made by Ed Walters and the truthfulness and integrity of Mr. Walters and his family. First, the reopening of the investigation was performed to determine if the model found in his former home in March 1990 by the current owners was used as a model to hoax his Polaroid photo- graphs made during the period of November 11, 1987 to May 1, 1988; and second, to evaluate the statements made to the press and electronic media by the teenager, Tommy Smith, in which he elaborated upon what Ed Walters was supposed to have told him about how each photo was made. An examination of the paper strip used to construct the paper plate model was a portion of a house plan diagram drawn September 7 or 8, 1989, by Ed Walters for the Lynn Thomas family. The house plan was drawn nearly two years after the first photos Ed made on November 11,1987, therefore this model could not have been the object allegedly used to fake his photos. The recorded testimony of Tommy Smith wherein he related what he claimed Ed had told him about how each photograph was made fell apart under close scrutiny of the facts and obvious contradictions in his own story. In defense of his absurd allegations, Tommy Smith said \"Ed will take his story to the grave.\" If Ed Walters was planning \"the ultimate trick\" as his detractors claim, sharing this with a local teenager (Tommy Smith) would be both utterly absurd and clearly ridiculous. Tommy Smith has refused to confront Ed Walters in the presence of MUFON investigators in an attempt to substantiate his claims. Why Tommy Smith, the son of a respected Gulf Breeze couple, would be motivated to fabricate such a story is unknown. (Tommy called the Mayor of Gulf Breeze, Ed Gray, and the Police Chief, Jerry Brown, since he knew he would find a receptive audience.) Based upon the investigations made by competent in- vestigators and researchers within the Mutual UFO Net- work, the evidence and the accumulated testimony of Ed Walters for his UFO experiences, are still valid. If evidence is ever revealed that is contrary to the MUFON conclusion stated, it will be announced in the Journal. May I personally thank all of the people who have worked so diligently over the past few years on this very significant case. FIRE IN THE SKY A full-length Paramount Pictures film \"Fire in the Sky\" will open in theaters nationwide on Friday, March 12, 1993. It is best known to Ufologists as the Travis Walton abduction case or the paperback book titled \"The Walton Experience.\" The lead actors are Robert Patrick (from Terminator II), D.B. Sweeney, and James Garner (veteran star of motion pictures and televi- sion). Directed by Rob Lieberman, Tracy Torme is the screen writer and one of the co-producers, along with Robert Strauss. The producers are Joe Wizan and Todd Black. Filmed in Oregon in an area that closely resembles the Apache-Sitgreaves National Forest, the motion picture depicts the experiences of Travis Walton and his lumberjack colleagues. Tracy Torme was the co- screen writer for the outstanding CBS-TV miniseries titled \"Intruders\" that was televised on May 17 and 19, 1992. Steve Carducci, a public relations person for Paramount Pictures, is coordinating a plan with MUFON for advance showing of \"Fire in the Sky\" in select theaters across the country for media publicity and MUFON discussion groups. Details will be announced in the February Journal with individual letters mailed to the directors in the appropriate cities in the near future. MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 297 January 1993"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"Dennis Stacy UFO Research in Australia and New Zealand A \"Digital Book\" From Down Under This is an idea whose time has come. Instead of \"wasting\" paper — or more specifically, trees — why not simply \"print\" books directly on computer floppy disks? Unfortu- nately, the execution of the idea falls just a little short of what it could have been, given the immense power of most modern desktop computers nowadays, leaving one slightly frustrated and longing for more. First, the good news. UFO Research consists of some 90.000 words culled from the files of the UFO Research Australia Newsletter, edited by Vladimir Godic of UFO- RA. Too many individual contributors are represented to name them all, but a few of the more recognizable Australian authors would surely include Keith Basterfield, Bill Chalker and Mark Moravec. Pony Godic has collated and edited the material that appears in the final book. It's a fairly complete compendium of local UFO lore and research, too, dating back to aboriginal folklore about \"sky beings\" and a few interesting 19th century cases, before finally arriving in modern times. The more familiar cases, such as the Knowles \"car chase,\" and the disappear- ance of pilot Frederick Valentich, are discussed in depth. Sections are devoted to several photographic cases and the UFO files of the Royal Australian Air Force, along with obligatory topics like entities, abductions, electromagnetic effects, ghost lights, Will'O the Wisps, and so on. All in all, there a total of 804 individual screens, or \"pages.\" The book itself comes on both a 5.25-inch floppy and a 3.5-inch diskette, along with a small, 12-page booklet con- taining color photographs, maps and several b&w drawings. The files are compressed, but putting them on your hard drive is a simple matter of inserting one of the disks in a disk drive and typing \"Install.\" The program automatically cre- ates a directory on your hard drive called \"UFOBOOK.\" After decompression, it occupies a mere 600 kilobytes or so of disk space. From the UFO BOOK directory, merely type UFO, and you're off and running — more or less. To read the book from the beginning, you can scroll through its pages in numerical sequence by hitting the Page Down key on your keyboard. To go back, hit Page Up. Pages can also be printed out at will. To \"thumb\" ahead, the book provides a Search function. Type in the topic you want to find, and the program jumps to that page. And here are where the technical limitations of the program used to put together the digital book start to pop up. First, it helps to know where you're going before you get there, so to speak. In other words, the book should open with a table of contents or subject choices, but it doesn't. Failing that, the Search screen should list a menu of choices or topics, but it doesn't do that, either. Instead, you have to type in the subject you want to search for, and hope the word (or words) occur somewhere in the text. There's a way to outwit the program, but it's not very satisfying. Simply search for anything and the program will scroll a table of contents. You can then use the Pause key to select a screen at a time. I f you see something you like, you can then go back and search for it and jump to that section. The Print function suffers similar limitations. You can print out pages, but only one at a time by using the Print Screen function of your computer. Ideally, you would be able to type in a page spread, say, pages 19-23, and have them all print out at once, or at least consecutively, but you can't. These limitations, while frustrating, are hardly fatal to the cause. Eventually you'll be able to access the informa- tion at will, either by reading the book straight through from the start, or by ultimately learning where it is you want to go. Still, it would have been more useful to have a more powerful program \"engine\" at your disposal. More disappointing, to my surprise, is the fact that the maps, drawing and color photographs are included only in the booklet. I'd also expected them to be included in the digital book as well, as GIF graphic files, so that they, too, could be viewed on screen or printed out at will, but this wasn't the case, and surely represents a missed opportunity. Even if copyright restrictions prevented the reproduction of some material, there must be many UFO charts, diagrams and photos around somewhere that could be scanned in as GIF graphics. Again, the computer technology is readily available, so why not take advantage of it? If you're going to do a digital book, then really do one. That grousing aside, UFO Research in Australia and Nen- Zealand is a step in the right direction. If you want to catch up on current events down under — and save a few precious trees in the process — this digital book is the way to go. UFO Research is published by Dynamo House Pty Ltd, P.O.

IUR is published bimonthly by the J. Allen Hynek Center for UFO Studies, popularly known as CUFOS. Editor Clark, a CUFOS Vice-President, probably needs no intro- duction here. What is amazing is that Jerry can turn out a new 3-volume UFO encyclopedia, with another on the way about anomalies in general, contribute a monthly UFO col- umn to Fate Magazine, and still have time left over to both edit and write for this highly regarded journal. Maybe the man simply doesn't sleep. If so, it doesn't noticeably show. The contents of the IUR, beginning with Clark's typically lengthy editorials, are consistently enter- taining, and the most current issue, NovVDec. 1992, Vol. 17, No. 6, is no exception. This time around, Clark takes on what he calls \"Cryptosnobbery,\" the tendency of some cryptozoologists to defend their own science at ufology's expense, mainly by distancing themselves from the latter. As usual, Clark doesn't run low on personal opinions or a will- ingness to express them in print. Michael D. Swords, a professor of natural sciences at Western Michigan University, Kalamazoo, and the editor of the Journal of UFO Studies, is on hand with a delightful first-person account of a recent three-day visit to the Clarksburg-Harrison County Public Library in Clarksburg, West Virginia, to peruse the personal library, files and cor- respondence of the late Gray Barker. No, the Grays them- selves aren't named after Barker, but they might as well be, given his pervasive influence on the shape of early ufology. Without Barker's They Knew Too Much About Flying Saucers (1956), for example, would we ever have even heard of the infamous Men in Black? I won't spoil your fun by revealing more about Barker's speckled career, but Swords' article alone is worth the price of admission. Dr. Richard F. Haines, a contributing editor, chips in a piece about a CE2 case in the eastern Ural Mountains of the former Soviet Union, and there is a lengthy article by Ole Jonny Braenne reviewing what is now known about the alleged crash of a flying disk on the island of Spitsbergen in the Barents Sea, several hundred miles north of Norway.

Magonia, editor John Rimmer I don't have the history of this persistently provocative journal on hand, but it sprang up sometime in the wake of Jacques Vallee's classic Passport to Magonia (1969), Magonia being an imaginal country of the mind, and remains true to its roots. If there is such a thing as literary ufology, and why not, this is it. Just don't expect to find any bug-eyed aliens and physical spaceships in its pages. Magonia remains committed to the notion that UFOs are mainly the stuff of modem myth, both collective and indi- vidual. The writing, although from a relatively limited stable of authors, is consistently entertaining and generally a cut in caliber above what you might expect from the average \"dry\" UFO journal. With Magonia #44 (October 1992), the layout and overall production quality show substantial improvement over past issues, although still plagued by an inordinate number of typos. Each issue runs to 24 pages, and I think is published four times a year. American sub- scriptions are $10, and should be submitted in US (or UK) notes only, due to the high cost of cashing checks in England. The meat of the latest issue consists of three feature arti- cles by Martin Kottmeyer, Dr. Eddie Bullard (on folklore and abductions), and your own humble reviewer (also on abductions). Kottmeyer, in the first of a three-part series, looks at flying saucers of the Fifties in terms of their per- ceived hostility (and humanity's collective hypochondria). My own article, \"Alien Abortions, Avenging Angels,\" com- pares the number and content of contemporary abduction reports with the number and contents of the abortion expe- rience and its aftermath, and suggests the two might be intimately related. Several pages of book reviews and com- mentary round out the issue. Usually there is an invigorat- ing exchange of letters as well.

Most of the items are short, interesting and to the proverbial point. Elaine Douglass, for example, breaks down the implications of the Roper Report \"abduction poll\" numbers and comes up with the \"factoid\" that 47 abductions take place every hour. I personally doubt the Roper Report numbers are what they purport to be, but they do make for interesting specula- tion. If politics is your bag, vote with a subscription.

Ware, Eastern Regional Director. Unless noted, no sound, vibration or odor was detected. All times are local. Log #920401E: On December 10, 1991 at 4:15 a.m., a lady observed a blimp-shaped object from her bedroom window for 10-15 minutes near Raleigh, NC; investigator, John Patterson. It appeared flat on the bottom and on both ends. It hovered, and it glowed red-orange so that structure could not be seen. When she woke her husband it moved away so he only got a brief sighting. Both had seen a saucer-shaped object about 1963 and again about 1984. Log #920402E: On March 11, 1992 at 3:52 a.m., a police officer near Haines City, FL had a close encounter with a green-glowing object that stopped his engine; inves- tigator, Fearon L. Hicks. The object followed his car, mov- ing from one side to the other; and then it moved in front, nearly filling the windshield. Green light from the object made his blue uniform appear purple. It was about 15 feet across and 3 feet high in the center with a white light on top. He reported the sighting. When he pulled the car to the side of the road, the engine, lights, and radio ceased to function; although the desk sergeant could hear the mike being keyed. A bright white light was shown into the vehi- cle, and he got out with the UFO only 20 feet away. He noticed the air around him had chilled so much he could see his breath fog. Three minutes after sighting the object, it sped away at tree-top level. Within two more minutes, another officer arrived and found him speechless, shaking and crying. Log #921103E: On August 20, 1992 about 10 p.m., several people observed strange lights near Pittsford, NY and called a MUFON investigator, who went to the scene and photographed them; investigator, George K. Hoenig. An object described as a \"stack of dishes\" rotated slowly as it rose and tumbled across the sky. The layers seemed to alternate in color from whitish-gray to pinkish-gray. This object was surrounded by faint, short streaks of light that darted about. The Kodak 1600 film showed the streaks to be brighter than seen by the naked eye because of the film's increased sensitivity to infrared radiation. They appeared red, sometimes changed direction rapidly, and pulsed at up to 420 Hz. George's F-stop of 8 and 1/30-second shutter speed avoided what would have been severe overexposure. This display was observed for over an hour and 15 minutes by the investigator. Log #921201E: On September 30, 1992 at 9:05 p.m., a 36-year-old lady, with 10 years of Army experience and psychological operations training, observed a UFO for 22 minutes moving east between 1-95 and Raeford, NC; inves- tigator, Wayne Laporte. The grayish object was shaped like a rectangle with the comers clipped, and it had six lights on the bottom. She got out of the car and watched. It appeared about 20 times the size of the full moon and was estimated to be about 1500 feet away as it passed overhead. Trailing the object were about 20 round or oval bluish-white lights. Both the object and each detached light had its own vapor mist behind it that stayed the same brightness and length. As it started to pass over her, the air became cold. Log #921202E: On September 30, 1992 at 9:10 p.m., a 45-year-old electrician in Gastonia, NC saw a cigar or oval shaped object with a bluish corona slowly heading 120° at about 2500 feet before it changed direction and rapidly accelerated to the east; investigator, George Fawcett. The object was estimated to be about the size of a house and was observed for about 25 seconds. There was a small disk, both fore and aft, each illuminated by a very intense flood- light from the large object. This incident apparently took place at the same time that a UFO was being observed near Raeford, NC, 120 miles to the east. Log # 921203E: On March 20, 1992 at 7:30 a.m., a fam- ily of six discovered a dark circle standing out boldly against the ice in a pasture on their horse farm, near Dundee, OH; investigators; Ted Spickler and Greg Knight (from West Virginia). Three hours earlier the wife heard the dogs barking, but did not investigate. No UFO was seen. The sheriff was not interested. The sky was 15,000 feet scat- tered, 25,000 feet overcast, and the temperature was 21°F. The circle was 27 to 30 feet in diameter, with a foot-wide light-brown band around the edge. Most of the grass one would have expected in the circle is gone, with no evi- dence of it ever having grown there; yet scattered random- ly throughout the circle are a few clumps of normally healthy grass. The darker color of the soil, compared with the surrounding soil, comes from an irregularly scattered pattern of black paniculate matter finely embedded in the soil. This matter looks like carbon and is being analyzed. About 30 feet north is a slender, jagged, three-foot \"scar\" on the pasture of similar appearance. One foot west of the cir- cle is a curious \"post\" hole about a foot deep with some loose soil at the bottom, but no other soil laying around it. The farmer was surprised at the sudden appearance of these strange things: He noticed his horses refused to go anywhere near the circle for five days after it mysteriously appeared. MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 297 January 1993"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"MUFON FORUM Letters to Mufon UFO Journal ° Armen Victorian I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate MUFON for publishing such a \"factual\" account of the case concerned (\"Confessions of a Crop Circle Spy,\" Nov., 1992), written by a professional \"journalist,\" Mr. James Schnabel, and \"Introduced\" by an experienced Editor, your good self. I should perhaps also add \"Sceptical Enquirer\" (sic) eat your heart out. After previ- ously being accused of working with a number of agen- cies like CIA, KGB, Ml5 and Ml6,1 guess our learned friends have run out of agencies, now they explore their chances with various countries, like Iran, Iraq, Libya, Armenia. There are still several other countries with which they can try their luck. Not forgetting, that for their own benefits, always half of the story about my orchid case is repeatedly published. I guess that is what my crit- ics prefer. I do not intend to ruin my chances of intrigue for the future publications and the publicity they give me. Shall I also add, that I enjoyed reading this article so much that as in previous occasions, I can only ask you to do me a small favour; Could you please publish it again in your next issue? My other colleagues who are asked to respond will no doubt comply with your request. In the meantime, I would continue my work. You may obtain the forthcoming issue of the \"UFO Magazine,\" published by Quest International for a more detailed account of my conversations with Mr. Schnabel. Tapes of these conversations too are also available for sale through Quest International catalogue. I hope MUFON Journal would go from strength to strength by publishing such high calibre satiric materials, and I wish our American colleagues in MUFON all the best in fulfilling this goal. - Armen Victorian Nottingham, England Quest International I would be grateful if you would allow me the oppor- tunity to respond to the James Schnabel article which appeared in Mufon UFO Journal No. 295, November 1992, both in my capacity as editor of \"UFO Magazine,\" the bi-monthly journal of Quest International, and as a Director of our company, Quest Publications International Limited. I will restrict my comments to those matters which concern our company, which sponsored the eleventh annual UK conference of Quest International, and where Mr. Armen Victorian was an invited speaker. Not one single press release pertaining to the confer- ence referred to Mr. Schnabel, or his so-called \"Plan.\" Armen Victorian (a name carried on his passport) has written a number of articles for our journal, \"UFO Magazine.\" I strongly refute the claim by Mr. Schnabel that Mr. Victorian is \"one of the leading lights of Quest.\" He is merely one of many contributors to our magazine and has no official capacity whatsoever within our com- pany or organization. As editor of \"UFO Magazine,\" 1 have published sev- eral articles from Mr. Victorian, some of which have dealt with intelligence and disinformation agencies at work within the UFO field. The fact that Mr. Victorian chooses to use a pseudonym in pursuit of information is a matter for him. That MUFON chose to publicly detail an individual's criminal record in its Journal, is, I believe, very questionable to say the least. As the so-called \"Master of Ceremonies\" at our con- ference, given the title of \"T\" by Mr. Schnabel in his arti- cle (I am not a prison officer, nor have I ever been), I wish to address certain points raised by him: I did receive a tape recording from Mr. Schnabel in the post shortly before our conference. Quite properly and correctly, I handed it to Mr. Victorian on the eve of the conference itself. It was for Mr. Victorian to pass any comment on its contents during delivery of his speech, not we, the organizers. As far as Quest International was concerned, Mr. Schnabel was a young American who had participated in the hoax circle competition in Buckinghamshire, England, on the weekend of July 12-13. We knew that Mr. Victorian was convinced Mr. Schnabel had actively participated in some form of disinformation, and were as keen as anyone else to learn more via our conference. If \"The Plan\" was ultimately designed to ridicule individuals such as Mr. Victorian, or further damage the Crop Circle subject, then the participants achieved some limited success. If it was ultimately designed to illustrate the \"paranoia\" that exists between ufology and the involvement of intelligence agencies, then I beg to differ. \"Paranoia\" is, according to the Oxford dictionary, a \"mental disease, with delusions of fame, grandeur, perse- cution.\" If we take that to its extreme, does MUFON sup- port Mr. Schnabel in his assertion that there is no such thing as intelligence involvement in crop circle studies? I need hardly remind your readers there is ample docu- mentation from the C.I.A. which proves conclusively the agency maintains a healthy interest in the subject. However, Dennis Stacy is quite right to point out in his leader article that \"The events ... don't particularly redound to anyone's credit.\" I wish to stress that the lec- ture given by Mr. Victorian, contained only a brief men- MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 297 January 1993"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"tion of the Schnabel/Irving affair, and was easily over- shadowed by his revelations pertaining to other matters, such as the \"Aviary,\" \"Majestic Twelve\" and other European intelligence affairs. Doubtless, because of Mr. Schnabel's article, Mr. Victorian will respond through these columns. I can inform your readership, that until Mr. Schnabel stood up and announced his presence to all and sundry late at the conference, none of us had a clue as to his even being there. Mr. Schnabel's friends were quite right to tell him he was imagining things when he first arrived. Paranoia? At the outset of question time, I made it clear that peo- ple would be restricted to one question. Mr. Schnabel stood up, I pointed to him, and asked him for his question. And what a question it was... \"Are you, Dr. Victorian, in fact Henry Azadehdel, the convicted criminal?\" One might be forgiven for thinking that was no ques- tion, but a deliberate attempt to incriminate and damage Mr. Victorian's reputation without just cause. It was grossly insensitive to say the least. Mr. Victorian chose to answer is his own manner, and then I moved on to the next questioner. Mr. Schnabel was allowed to remain in the theatre audience, and was further allowed unrestricted access to those people who wished to question him at length about his revelations at the end of conference. Our organization totally rejects the assertion by Mr. Schnabel that the Leeds conference resembled the \"Spanish Inquisition ... the Salem Witch Trials ... the Stalin purges [or] Senator McCarthy's Un-American Activities Committee.\" We take great exception to those scurrilous remarks. It is an insult to our honesty and integrity, and that of our guest speakers, who included Anthony Dodd, a former police officer of 25 years outstanding service; Colin Andrews, one of the world's leading experts on Crop Circle phenomenon; Robert Dean, a MUFON Director; and myself, who first began investigating the UFO sub- ject in 1967. How can one equate Mr. Schnabel's damning criti- cism of our conference with the opinion expressed by MUFON's Robert Dean, who said of it: \"It was one of the most enjoyable conferences I have ever experienced.\" We had an excellent conference, heard and saw many new breakthroughs and developments in the respective fields of Ufology and Crop Circles. No petty-minded gen- eralization centered on the fun and games begun by Schnabel and his associates should deflect from that fact. That Mr. Schnabel has been allowed to attack Mr. Victorian at the expense of Europe's largest independent UFO organization, as well as castigate our other respect- ed speakers within the pages of the MUFON Journal, is nothing short of a disgrace. It does little to enhance inter- national cooperation, demeans Ufology, and highlights the need for MUFON to adopt greater tactful diplomacy when dealing with matters of this kind in the future - like approaching others for their views before publication for instance? - Graham W. Birdsall Editor, UFO Magazine Leeds, England Schnabel Replies Let me first make it clear that although my article poked fun at the readiness of some cereologists to accuse their ideological opponents of espionage, I did not wish to ridicule the notion that governments may take a covert interest in strange phenomena. I am a little doubtful that any government would be too interested in crop circles, since I know how easy they are to make with a plank or garden roller; but on the subject of current government interest in UFOs, I must plead ignorance. As for Birdsall's letter, the antidote to most of it is my article itself, which Birdsall appears not to have read very carefully. For example, he claims that I assert a resem- blance between the Leeds Conference and the Spanish Inquisition, etc. But see in the article how well I qualify (perhaps over qualify) that resemblance. Birdsall implies that Quest issued no press releases pertaining to The Plan. But I spoke to the reporter who wrote the newspaper piece I excerpted in the MUFON arti- cle; the piece, he told me, was based on a press release that had come from Quest, and clearly refers to The Plan (e.g. our attempt to \"recruit\" Victorian, and our \"links\" with \"the military intelligence agencies of several nations\"). Birdsall implies that \"Armen Victorian\" is his green- thumbed colleague's real name, because he holds a pass- port in that name. I have no wish to dig further into Victorian's personal history, but presumably Birdsall knows that Victorian holds two other passports, in two other names, and was prosecuted under the name \"Henry Azadehdel.\" (My friends and I noted that at the Leeds Conference, Birdsall addressed Victorian at one point as \"Henry\".) Birdsall also says that, contrary to a parenthetical remark I made in the article, he is not a prison officer. Two British ufologists told me that he was, and Birdsall's own remarks at the Leeds Conference seemed to confirm that; but if he is not, I offer him my apologies. I suspect, however, that neither I nor anyone else will receive an apology for Birdsall's behavior in promising the British press and the Leeds Conference audience sen- sational revelations of cereological espionage; in permit- ting Victorian to tell his slanderous spy story despite powerful evidence to the contrary which I had already provided him; and in permitting Armen Victorian after- wards to sell the spy story via Quest Publications, despite the evident conversion of Birdsall himself to the view that it was all a hoax. Birdsall has the gall to suggest that MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 297 January 1993"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"notwithstanding my honest efforts to prevent him and others from making fools of themselves, \"The Plan\" was a grandly devious attempt to ridicule the paranoia of cere- ologists. I had no quarrel with Birdsall or any of the other characters in the story (or with their ufological views, many of which I share), and the article would never have been written had he and others not wilfully ignored the evidence I gave them. I suspect that Birdsall (who complains that my article insults his \"honesty and integrity\") also will fail to apolo- gize for the other hoax which he presented that day in Leeds: a 1954 BBC newsreel film of UFOs, whose canis- ter cover sheet, marked RESTRICTED, Birdsall dis- played as evidence for a government cover-up. As Birdsall (and Victorian) knew well, the RESTRICTED stamp had been placed there recently by one of their friends purely as a joke, and as noted last summer in a let- ter to the editor of Quest's UFO Magazine (i.e., Birdsall), the film is freely available at the VISNEWS film library in London. Birdsall seems most disturbed that my article was published in a ufology journal. He invokes international cooperation and ufological solidarity as principles accord- ing to which articles critical of his actions should be cen- sored. But can ufology have any hope of acceptance by orthodox science if it becomes the private playpen of Birdsalls, Victorians, and their like-minded colleagues, with no alternative views allowed? - Jim Schnabel Oxford, England The Editor's Two Cents I'm afraid I must apologize to many of our readers for having opened this particular can of worms in the pages of the Journal! Obviously, what I had in mind was not a running engagement of words with any particular individ- ual or UFO organization. My intention in publishing Schnabel's original article was that it would be read by both sides as a morality tale. On one hand, I had hoped that any would-be hoaxers (of crop circles, UFOs or-other strange phenomena) might realize how hard it is to put the genie back in the bottle once it is let loose; on the other, I had also hoped that those researchers who investi- gate these phenomena might realize the basic perils of paranoid thinking, of the belief that behind every bush and cloud (or within every organization) lurks a govern- ment (or military) intelligence agent, busily engaged in some grand conspiracy to cover-up or confuse this or that particular phenomenon. (My dictionary, incidentally, also defines paranoid as \"exhibiting or characterized by extreme fear or mistrust of others: a paranoid suspicion that the phone might be bugged.\" Interestingly, the next entry in the new American Heritage Dictionary of the English language is \"paranormal.\" My, how the two do go together!) Despite the many side-issues that have now been raised, I would like to refocus the debate on a select few. For starters, no one has yet demonstrated, to my satisfac- tion at least, exactly why crop circles should be the sub- ject of an orchestrated government cover-up. And this will continue to be the case as long as no one knows with certainty what crop circles are. To claim otherwise, i.e., that a government conspiracy definitely is involved, is simply a classic case of putting the cart before the horse. The fundamental question, which won't go away, is this: What is it that the hoaxers are hoaxing? Interview Transcript George Wingfield also had something to say about the Jim Schnabel article which appeared in these pages. Due to a series of miscommunications, however, his response appears in the current issue of the HUFON Report, the regular newsletter of the Houston UFO Network, and because of space considerations will not now be reprinted here. The same issue (January 1993) also contains the transcript of the telephone interview with Schnabel con- ducted by Armen Victorian, which was pulled at the last moment from The Circular, which Wingfield then edited for the Centre for Crop Circle Studies in England, while the latter was on tour in the United States. Readers inter- ested in reading the interview for themselves, along with Wingfield's remarks, are urged to write HUFON for a copy. The single issue cover price is $1.50, so I would recommend enclosing a total of $2 to cover postage & handling. HUFON's address is P.O. Box 942, Bellaire, TX 77402-0942. Right To Know On behalf of Operation Right to Know, I want to respond to criticisms of our planned July 1993 demonstration in Washington voiced in an article by Fund for UFO Research Secretary-Treasurer Fred Whiting in the November 1992 issue of the Journal. In reading Whiting's piece, I found areas where we both agree and disagree. For example, Whiting's proposal for interested per- sons to write letters to their Representatives and/or Senators concerning investigation of the UFO phenome- non has merit. Those opposing UFO secrecy may want to use his sample letter as a basis for their own. Letters should stress the evidence in the Roswell case, the strongest of the crash retrieval cases to date. But it should come as no surprise that we don't share Whiting's view of our planned July 1983 demonstration. I will respond to his arguements point by point: 1. There is no need for a demonstration to have hun- dreds of thousands of attendees to make an impact. Smaller demonstrations can also make a difference, particularly when they involve a subject as exotic and unusual as gov- ernment UFO secrecy. What is important is that we make MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 297 January 1993"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"our views known to those policymakers in Washington with knowledge of the subject that the UFO cover-up will no longer continue with our silent acquiescence. 2. It is true that there is no sizeable active constituency supporting an end to government UFO secrecy. However, there is a sizeable potential constituency, if one takes into account that 48% of the population that believes UFOs exist (according to opinion polls), the tens of thousands of people who have had close encounters over the past 45 years (many of whom have had direct experience with government intimidation and harassment), retired military and intelligence personnel who have come up against the cover-up, and the millions of abductees the Roper Poll indicates may be living in this country. ORTK was established to appeal to this potential con- stituency and to demand an end to the cover-up. We know the public is totally unaware of the existence of a massive UFO cover-up. That is precisely why we want to stage a public demonstration outside the White House. We want to draw attention to an issue which desperately needs to be addressed, but which is getting hardly any public atten- tion. The serious and interested response of passers-by to the earlier demonstration in Washington dispels the notion that such actions will be dismissed as involving a \"bunch of cranks.\" 3. With good preparation and publicity, media cover- age can be generated which will convey to some extent the why, who and what of the cover-up. Violence is not the only way to attract publicity. July is generally a slow news month in Washington and reporters are always look- ing for an unusual or unique story. What could be more unique or unusual than hundreds or thousands of demon- strators protesting government UFO secrecy outside the White House? I would like to add that, contrary to what Whiting has argued, our initial demonstration was not intended to attract a large amount of media coverage. Rather, it was intended to influence the UFO community to overcome its ingrained fear of ridicule and to initiate political action on the UFO/IAC question. Whiting says he is afraid our planned demonstration will alienate those members of Congress and the commit- tee staffers the Fund is quietly approaching to seek Con- gressional UFO hearings. If he is so certain our demonstra- tion will attract no publicity, then why is he worried? Whiting's opposition to public demonstrations and his advocacy of the quiet, behind-the-scenes approach to Congress brings to mind NICAP's similarly subdued atti- tude. Yet their years of effort resulted only in a one-day hearing before a House committee in 1966 which present- ed the government's viewpoint alone and achieved no results. A later 1968 House Symposium merely allowed a presentation of views pro and con which failed to shed any light on what the government knew about UFOs. Without the public pressure of demonstrations and a letter-writing/lobbying campaign to influence members of Congress, the Fund's quiet approach to \"one or more influential committees in the House and the Senate\" is likely to run into the same dead-end that NICAP's efforts did in the 1960's. - Dan Pinchas Operation Right to Know Anderson Axed Continued investigation into the reported 1947 crashes of two alien craft in New Mexico has caused the authors of the newest book on the subject to re-evaluate their posi- tion on one major information source. Don Berliner and Stanton Friedman, authors of Crash at Corona (Paragon House, New York, 1992), no longer have confidence in the testimony of Gerald Anderson, who claims to have stumbled upon a crash site with members of his family. Anderson has admitted falsifying a document, and so his testimony about finding wreckage of a crashed flying saucer near the Plains of San Augustin in western New Mexico and then being escorted out by the U.S. mili- tary, can no longer be seen as sufficiently reliable. The authors regret the need to take this step, but feel it is absolutely necessary if they are to stand behind their book and subsequent research into what continues to be the most important story of the millennium. This does not mean they feel there was no crash at the Plains of San Augustin; there is considerable impressive testimony to such an event. Nor does it mean that everything reported by Gerald Anderson is without value. - Don Berliner and Stanton Friedman Although it strongly suggests it! - Editor Sexism Kudos to Washington, D.C. State Director Elaine Douglass for her bold letter in the December 1992 issue bringing the issue of sexism and discrimination in the Ufological field to the forefront. Yes, indeed, there is discrimination towards female Ufologists, however subtle and indirect it may be, especially in the more technical areas of research. However, a bit of good news out here on the West Coast where, I can proudly boast, women make up a solid percentage of the Executive and Advisory Board of the Los Angeles section, MUFON L.A., and along with their male counterparts have succeeded in tripling membership and multiplying attendance at monthly meetings tenfold!

Bryant Named New Director of Governmental Affairs Larry W. Bryant was born February 26, 1938, in Shenandoah, VA. He is a writer by profession. His formal education consists of one year of post-secondary (at the College of William and Mary, Williamsburg, VA) and there- after mostly self-educated. A career, synopsis of Mr. Bryant provides an insight into his ability to fulfill the position of Director of Governmental Affairs on the MUFON Board of Directors, succeeding Major Donald E. Keyhoe, USMC Ret. A federal employee since May 1958, Larry W. Bryant has seen his official duties progress in parallel with his commitment to serious UFO research. \"This means,\" he says, \"that most of the skills that I develop on the job can be transferred to my private writ- ing/research pursuits - and vice versa. Thus ensues the ultimate symbiosis of public-private knowledge and experi- ence.\" Indeed, his long record of UFO research and social activism began in 1957, upon his association with the National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena. Early on in his NICAP days, he concentrated on docu- menting, analyzing and revealing the methodology, protocols, findings, and political ramifications of official U.S. gov- ernment research into UFO encounters. As a founding member of the pub- lic interest group Citizens Against UFO Secrecy, Bryant has directed the CAUS Washington, D.C., office from his home in Alexandria, VA, since 1978. His con- tribution to the group's newsletter Just Cause, authorship of several CAUS special reports, and his initiation of var- ious CAUS litigation efforts under the U.S. Freedom of Information Act and U.S. Privacy Act, reflect his under- standing of how certain government agencies maintain tight control over their UFO-related policies, practices and records. Despite his role as a harsh critic of governmental action (or inaction) on the UFO-research scene, Bryant acknowl- edges that the government's advantage in having a wide, profound access to hard- core UFO data renders the government's participation \"the only game in town. So, we must find a way (via congressional intervention; via public demonstrations; via a network of 'leak' sources/information?) to compel a 'negotiated settlement' with appropriate federal officials as to what the government knows, and when it knew it, about UFO reality.\" A periodic contributor to the Mutual UFO Network's UFO Journal, he welcomes the chance to strengthen every MUFON member's hand in making the government fully accountable for its past, present and future UFO-related activity. Statement of philosophical position: \"The public has a right to know all about the extent of official Ufology, and the government has a duty to tell. Otherwise, the body politic, now basically excluded from the official UFO-decision- making process, will remain ignorant of that process and can be subjected to mis- and disinformation at its peril.\" Larry may be contacted by writing to 3518 Martha Custis Drive, Alexandria, VA 22302, or by telephone (703) 931-3341.

Fortuitously, on the same night the lunar crescent lies nearby — a stunning sight.

Jupiter (-2.3), brightening and retrograding in Virgo, rises in the E at 10 PM on the 1st, 9 PM on the 15th, and 8 PM on the 28th.

Jupiter stands in the SW at dawn. • Moon Phases: Full moon — February 6 Last quarter-February 13 New moon - February 21 Some years have only three lunar phases in February. • The Stars: At 9 PM the Winter Circle of bright stars is prominent in the southern heavens. Foremost of these luminaries is the bluish-white Dog Star Sirius, which crosses the celes- tial meridian at this time of night (in mid-February). Its only competitors are a trio of planets all possibly (but barely) in view at 9 PM in mid month: Venus is setting in the W; Mars, no dimmer than Sirius, lies high in the S; and Jupiter is near rising in the E. A very early hint that spring isn't far off: Leo the Lion, the spring sky symbol, has already climbed above the E hori- zon by mid evening. Between the Sickle of Leo and the Twin Stars of Gemini, look for a very dim patch. Requiring a clear dark sky without light pollution, the lit- tle blur is resolved in binoculars into a wedge-shaped cluster of stars in Cancer the Crab called the Beehive.
