Second class postage paid at Quincy, IL. 62301 Dear Mr. Connelly, I was most interested to see, in the October, 1974, Skylook, a few com- ments addressed to my article on UFO's and deception, which had pre- viously appeared. Since Mr. Hall has apparently misunderstood the point I was trying to make, I would like to say a few words in clarification. I am not sure how I feel about being re- ferred to as an \"agent provocateur\" or a \"noise generator,\" but I think these epithets are undeserved. My point is that we should con- sider that UFO beings might want to deceive us. Some reasons for this I put forward in my article; there might well be other reasons. That we should be on guard against such de- ception does not imply that we make a complete change in regard to our approach. Mr. Hall says that \"If we make the assumption that we are deliberately being misled, then the only 'counter- strategy' would be to discard what our senses and our science can tell us about UFO's and start substituting pure imagination.\" That this assertion is an exaggeration can easily be seen if I were to suggest that since the Russians continually try to deceive us about their strategic capabilities, we should give up taking satellite pictures and substitute pure imagina- ion. This is clearly absurd. My suggestion about deception is not, as Mr. Hall would suggest, a coun- sel of despair, but rather one of cau- tion. I am simply suggesting that pat- terns we find in looking at UFO data may be contrived. This does not mean that we should throw the data away; there may be important clues in it to what is really happening. As far as this, I agree with John Keel. I think in this context that many researchers might profit from read- ing some of the better case-studies in strategic deception. One I would rec- ommend is Barton Whaley's Code- word Barbarossa (MIT Press, 1973), which deals with how the Germans managed to deceive the Russians into thinking that they were not about to be invaded. I do not believe that I have \"a superior pipeline to truth,\" as Mr. Hall clearly suggests. As my article clearly states, I am only trying \"to give the strategic point of view some airing.\" Indeed, I think it does still deserve some serious consideration.

Len introduced me to many of his UFO colleagues, some of whom provided useful leads, and he took an active part in the investigations. The exten- sive notes I made that week are the primary source of informa- tion used in this report, supple- mented by certain information acquired since then. We had hoped to obtain defini- tive information on three par- ticular cases—the observation of small humanoids under a bridge at Loveland, Ohio (called \"the bridge case\"), the Sym- monds encounter with small be- ings in southern Georgia (Mrs. Symmonds was a resident of Cincinnati), and the Greenhills case. Other incidents had been briefly referred to and although we tried to pin these down, the results were negative. However, in pursuring leads on the three cases outlined above, we came upon another encounter in the Loveland area that had not been previously reported—the extra- ordinary Hunnicutt case at Branch Hill, described in this report. Although the results of these inquiries were indeed interest- ing, we found them not entirely satisfactory for several reasons. They lacked clearcut and de- finitive quality. All of the re- ports, except the Greenhills case, were single-witness en- counters, while the latter in- cluded certain dubious elements that suggested the possibility of a hoax. The stories remained somewhat elusive and fragmen- tary. All in all, the findings did not seem to warrant a formal presentation at that time. The highlights of these cases were summarized by Stringfield in his book, INSIDE SAUCER POST ... J4) BLUE, an account of his own experiences as a UFO researcher; but at the time, no full-length report of our investi- gations was felt necessary. Today the situation is differ- ent. Stringfield's book, for so long the only first-hand source about these cases, has been copied and recopied at second and third hand, and in the pro- cess certain inaccuracies have intruded. Additional informa- tion has been found regarding some of the earlier uncertain- ties. Accordingly, a detailed re- port providing more complete and accurate information seems to be in order. Cases similar to those in 1955 continue to be re- ported in this country and abroad. In the light of these more recent reports, it is appro- priate to look back again on those earlier accounts, and this report is being prepared to make available accurate, first- hand information, in an organ- ized form, to those who share an interest in this particular as- pect of the UFO subject. BRANCH HILL, OHIO- MAY 25, 1955 The Branch Hill encounter was unknown prior to August, 1956, beyond the original partici- pants. It came to light during an interview by this reporter with Loveland Police Chief John K. Fritz on Aug. 31, in a meeting arranged to inquire about an- other incident that had occurred in the summer of 1955, involving a 19-year-old Civil-Defense vol- unteer who had reported seeing a group of foul-smelling \"little men\" under a bridge in Love- land (to be reported in Decem- ber Skylook). When the Loveland bridge case was brought up during our interview, Chief Fritz appeared reluctant to discuss what had happened. In what seemed to be a diversionary tactic, he changed the subject by introduc- ing another humanoid encounter that.had occurred near Love- land several months before the bridge case. He freely provided what details he could recall and showed no hesitation in discuss- ing this report. Fritz could not remember the exact date but thought it had occurred some time in March or April, 1955. He searched his files for the police report on the case but was unable to locate it. (He was looking under the wrong date.) Fritz told me that this was the kind of a report that \"would make your hair stand on end.\" The back of my neck did tingle perceptibly. The police chief recounted how he had been awakened by someone pounding on his front door about 4 a.m. Answering, he was confronted by a some- what shaken man named Robert Hunnicutt, standing in the door- way. \"He looked as if he'd seen a ghost,\" Fritz said. Hunnicutt, a short-order chef in a newly-opened Loveland area restaurant, told the police chief that while he was driving northeast through Branch Hill (in Symmes Township) on the Madeira-Loveland Pike, he had seen a group of \"strange little —4—"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"men\" along side of the road with \"their backs to the bushes.\" Cur- ious, he had stopped the car and gotten out. According to Fritz, the wit- ness claimed that he had seen \"fire coming out of their hands,\" and a \"terrible odor\" permeated the place. When Hunnicutt real- ized he was looking at some- thing quite out of the ordinary he became frightened and, jumping back into his car, had driven directly to the police chief's home. Fritz, who knew Hunnicutt, found it difficult to believe his story \"straight out,\" but he said there was no question in his mind that Hunnicutt was \"scared to death.\" Said Fritz: \"The man had seen something, and there's no argument to that.\" By getting close enough to smell his breath, Fritz was sat- isfied that there was no question of Hunnicutt's having been drinking. He agreed to check the area and told Hunnicutt to go on home. Chief Fritz dressed, got his gun, loaded his camera, and drove to the area indicated by Hunnicutt. He made four or five passes along the road look- ing for signs of something unu- sual but he saw nothing that was out of the ordinary. Alone, with the details of Hunnicutt's strange story fresh in his mind, Fritz acknowledged that he did indeed \"feel peculiar\"; he also felt like he may have been \"the biggest fool in Loveland.\" Asked why he had taken a camera, he said he wanted evi- dence in the form of photo- graphs if he came across any- thing unusual. Asked what he would have done if he had en- countered the strange little beings, he replied that he would have gotten out of the car \"and tried to talk to them, to find out where they come from.\" He added that \"someone has to do it 1 «S? ^BP <Mf*fi*m»*ff*KiK^m* *f» *ff *&*E*K*mf vmfvE ^S» ^1? vD^mt ^M&^l&^Jt* Branch Hill, in Symmes Town- ship. As he topped a small rise and was coming down a slight grade, his car lights fell on what he first thought were three men kneeling down in the grass on the right side of the road, just inside the berm. \"My first impression was that there were three crazy guys praying by the side of the road,\" he told us. He brought his car to a stop \"to see what gives,\" with the car lights illu- minating the scene. It was at this time that he realized they were not three kneeling men: a sense of something quite extra- ordinary suddenly came over him, for the figures before him were not even men. The figures were short, and they stood in a roughly triangu- lar position facing the opposite side of the road; one was for- ward and closer to the road (and to the witness), while the other two stood in flank positions to the rear. The forward figure held his arms a foot or so above his head and it appeared to Hun- nicutt as though he were holding a rod, or a chain, in this upraised position. (The detail of up- raised arms was described by Mrs. Symmonds in the Stockton, Ga., encounter of July 3,1955; it was also described in the Hop- kinsville, Ky.,case.) Sparks, blue-white in color and two or three at a time, were seen jumping back and forth from one hand to the other, just above and below the \"rod.\" It was Hunnicutt's impression that the beings were concentrat- ing on some spot directly across the road, although he did not see anyone, or anything, there. (This was a sparsely settled sec- tion of the Loveland-Madeira Pike, with woods to the west of the road.) Hunnicutt then got out of the left side of his car; at the same sooner of later.\" While Hunnicutt had not re- ported seeing a UFO, Chief Fritz said that there had been a sighting by members of the local Ground Observer Corps earlier that same night. The UFO sighting had been reported in the local newspaper, although Fritz did not have a copy of the press story. This would be an important reference insofar as it would serve to date Hunni- cutt's encounter with the hu- manoids. Fritz was willing to provide the current address of the wit- ness who, at the time of our in- quiries, resided in Avondale. Hunnicutt was contacted imme- diately upon my return from Loveland, and he agreed to meet with the Stringfields and me on the following night. ACCOUNT BY THE WITNESS At the time of our interview on Sept. 1, 1956, Hunnicutt was the maitre d' of a restaurant in downtown Cincinnati. We met him early in the evening, before he was scheduled to go on duty, and spent more than an hour with him going over the details of his strange experience of the previous year. Extensive notes were made and a drawing of the \"little men\" was done by String- field under the careful super- vision of the witness. Hunnicutt was most coopera- tive in responding to our many questions, and he impressed us with the cautious manner in which he reconstructed all those details he could accurately re- call. As far as he could remember, Hunnicutt placed the date in the same period Fritz had men- tioned—March or April, 1955. He had been coming home from work on the night of the inci- dent. It was about 3:30 a.m. Driving north on the Madeira- Loveland Pike, he was in the vicinity of Hopewell Road at —5—"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"time, the forward figure low- ered his arms and, near his feet, seemed to release whatever he had been holding. To the wit- ness, \"it looked as if he tied it around his ankles.\" Then, as Hunnicutt stood by the left side of the car, all three figures simultaneously turned slightly to their left so that they now faced the witness. Motion- less, and with absolutely no sound or change of expression, they stared directly at him. In the car lights, Hunnicutt was able to closely observe a number of details. This most extraordinary trio consisted of three humanoid figures, each of whom stood about three and a half feet high; they were all of a greyish color—approximately the same shade of grey for their heads as for their \"garments.\" \"Fairly ugly,\" were the words Hunnicutt used to describe them. A large, straight mouth, with- out any apparent lip muscles, crossed nearly the entire lower portion of their faces, an effect which reminded the witness of a frog. The nose was indistinct, with no unusual features the witness could discern. The eyes seemed to be more or less nor- mal, except that no eyebrows could be seen. The top of the head was bald and appeared to have rolls of fat running horizontally across the top, rather like the corregated effect of a doll's painted-on hair —except that there was no dif- ference in color. The most remarkable feature was the upper torso: the chest was decidedly lop-sided. On the right side of the figures, the chest swelled out in an unusual- ly large bulge that began under the armpit and extended to the waist, giving them a markedly assymmetrical appearance. The arms seemed to be of uneven length, the right one being long- er than the left, as though to accommodate this unusual fea- ture. (The lopsided torso seems to be unique in humanoid re- ports; no other example has yet been found that matches it.) Hunnicutt saw nothing unu- sual about the hands, although he could not say how many fingers they had. If they wore garments above their waists, they were tight- fitting and the same color grey as the rest of the body. No line of demarcation could be de- tected between a garment and the skin itself. Below the waist, however, there seemed to be a loose-fitting garment of the same grey color, but Hunnicutt was unable to recall any details other than the hips and waist appeared to be \"heavy.\" He could see no feet, but the figures stood in grass that was about six inches high. Hunnicutt's car was parked about 20 feet away from the humanoids. After standing next to the left-hand door for perhaps a minute or a minute and a half, his curiosity overcame any fear he might have felt and he started to walk around the left front of the car toward the trio. As he reached the front fender the three little humanoids simul- taneously moved slightly - for- ward and toward the witness—a \"peculiar\" motion that was quite definite and \"graceful.\" Hunni- cutt had the distinct impres- sion that he should approach no closer—no words were needed. He stood by the front fender for perhaps two or three minutes more, too amazed by this bizarre spectacle to be fright- ened. Hunnicutt said that when he finally left, it was only to get someone else to see these strange figures. As he got back into his car he was suddenly aware of an extremely strong and penetrating odor, which was most noticeable as he drove off. He compared it to a combina- tion of \"fresh-cut alfalfa, with a slight trace of almonds.\" Only as he drove away, past these three weird grotesques, did the frightening implications of what he had seen begin to sink in. Although it was nearly 4 a.m., he drove directly to the home of Loveland Police Chief John K. Fritz. Hunnicutt said that he had an impression he might have in- truded upon some kind of \"operation.\" Asked to explain, he said that when he realized the figures weren't praying, he had a distinct feeling that the for- ward figure was using the im- plement in his hands as a signal to someone, or some thing, on the opposite side of the road, al- though he could not see anything in the woods on that side of the road. Regarding the odor, Hunni- cutt said that several months later (July or August), he was driving along the same road with a girl friend late at night. As he passed the spot where the three humanoids had been seen earlier, both he and.the girl noticed the same strong odor he had smelled on the night of his encounter. He stopped the car, looked around and, seeing nothing unusual, drove on. Hunnicutt also confirmed that there had been a UFO sighting at the Loveland GOC post earlier on the same night that he had seen the \"little men.\" He said an account of this ob- servation had been published in the next edition of the local paper. UFO SIGHTING BY LOVELAND GOC — MAY 24 During the week I visited the Stringfields, Len arranged meet- ings with a number of his asso- ciates in and around Cincinnati, some of whom were helpful in ****************************************** —6—"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"— L— 1 tl&d&jlUI&jB"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"1 assisting us in our inquiries of the events of the previous year. One of these was Frank White- cotton, the chief co-ordinator for Civil Defense in Hamilton Coun- ty and surrounding areas, and head of the Loveland GOC post. Our meeting took place at the Stringfield home on Sunday night, Aug. 26,1956. Whitecotton was an impres- sive man—authoritative, ser- ious, with a craggy face and a shock of white hair. He had a great deal of information re- garding local UFO sightings; his staff at the Loveland GOC post was an active and inter- ested group who had themselves made a number of observations. Whitecotton gave us a very detailed account of one of these: his wife and another woman had been manning the post one eve- ning in the spring of 1955 when several objects were spotted. An official report was made to the filter center at Columbus and jets were scrambled to investi- gate. Whitecotton viewed this particular sighting as important and, because of its official sta- tus, he asked us not to take notes. Not having yet learned of the Hunnicutt case and its associa- tion to the GOC sighting of the same night, the significance of Whitecotton's narrative escaped us, and neither Stringfield nor I tried to reconstruct the details on paper after our guest had left. The passage of time has erased almost all of my recol- lection of Whitecotton's ac- count, except that one of the UFOs, upon buzzing the GOC post, had so frightened Mrs. Whitecotton and her colleague that they fled the tower leaving the door wide open. It wasn't until several years later, on a subsequent visit to Cincinnati, that I had an oppor- tunity to go through the news- paper morgue of the Loveland (Ohio) Herald in search of the press reference to the GOC sighting which both Hunnicutt and Chief Fritz had mentioned. The story had been published in the edition for Thursday, June 2, 1955. It was not until this news ac count was found that a connec tion could be made betweei Whitecotton's report of the Loveland GOC sighting and the news account mentioned by Chief Fritz and Robert Hunni- cutt. This report, unfortunately, lacks any of the dramatic de- tails provided by Whitecotton. It serves, however, the impor- tant purpose of providing the correct date of the Hunnicutt encounter. DISCUSSION Although this report involves only a single witness, there an other points that enhance its credibility. Hunnicutt was straightforward and coopera- tive in answering all our ques- tions about his experience, and in helping Stringfield prepare a sketch, of the humanoids. His manner was quiet and cautious given to understatement in re counting the details; if he was uncertain about a particular point, he said so. Nothing in his presentation suggested that he was elaborating or lying. Internally, nothing in his story was inconsistent with what Chief Fritz had already re- ported. Hunnicutt's reconstruc- tion of the encounter impressed us as a careful recollection of his observation of strange and unfamiliar beings—beings cer- tainly not native to Ohio, or any other part of the world with which we are familiar. Hunnicutt's initial response to the situation is also significant. He responded by reporting it immediately to the chief of police. This would scarcely have been the case, particularly at that hour of the morning, if he had not been quite certain of what he'd seen. Chief Fritz's own account of the incident supports Hunni- cutt's: it was clear that he took the story seriously enough to get dressed and go out to the site to investigate. Finally, the news story about a UFO sighting at the Loveland GOC earlier that night, to which both men referred, lends addi- tional weight to the story. (The relationship — if any — of the UFO sighting to Hunnicutt's en- counter, of course, remains un- certain.) Hunnicutt never sought pub- licity as a result of his encount- er. It came to our attention by accident, and it was Stringfield and myself who sought him out. Once contacted, he asked only that his name not be associated with any published account of the incident. (His request has been ignored by others and, un- fortunately, his name has been part of the published record of the incident for a number of years.) The temptation to dismiss Hunnicutt's story because it is so strange is understandable; but considered along with hun- dreds of other similar reports logged since 1955, it behooves us as serious researchers to re- examine it in the light of more recent information. Similar en- counters continue to be re- ported ; no matter how one may feel about such things happen- ing, the evidence exists in a massive volume of reports. Only by carefully examining these reports, and those who make them, can we find the clues to what it is we are dealing with. Witnesses like Hunnicutt comprise the bulk of our evi- dence: they must be heard and questioned, their reports col- lected, examined critically, and evaluated. —8—"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"Massachusetts couple claims Daylight UFO sighting Editor's Note: Following is the report of an investigation by Dave Webb, MUFON State Director for Massachusetts, of the alleged daylight sighting of a highly re- flective UFO near Keene, N.H. The sighting occurred near the beginning of a flap of reports from that state. The sighting was of short duration and no struc- tural details were noted on the object. The last names of the witnesses have been deleted, since they requested that they not be identified publicly. The Report At approximately 10 a.m. EOT on the morning of Monday, Aug. 12,1974, Bill and Kathy were driving to Kathy's father's house to help paint it. The sky was clear \"without a cloud,\" but the day was already quite hot. They had just arrived at a major four- way highway intersection just south of Keene where S. Main St. and Rts. 9,101 and 12 cross. They were travel- ing east on Rt. 101/9 and were at a stoplight preparing to turn south onto Rt. 12 to go to Swanzey. As they waited for the stoplight to change, some \"kids\" in a \"state truck\" (a pickup) next to them (presumably to their left on the four-lane highway) excitedly pointed to an object in the sky to the ENE. Bill and Kathy looked and saw an elongated brightly reflect- ing metallic, silver object with no obvious wings or other protuberances. Bill said it looked \"like a mirror\" or \"like a sun.\" Although the shape was ill defined because of the reflective glare, the reflecting area seemed to get smaller rather than bigger, as if it were rotat- ing. The UFO was about 45 degrees up in the ENE. The sun was well up in the sky, so their eyes were shielded from its glare by the car's roof. (Sun- rise was at 5:53 a,m EDT, so the sun would have been about 60 degrees up in the east on that day.) When first seen the object was either \"kind a still\" (Kathy) or mov- ing slightly (Bill). Then it rocked back and forth along its long axis several times. Kathy characterized this motion as \"jiggling.\" The UFO moved to the left (north), then back, apparently continuing the jiggling motion. The main impression that the witnesses received during this period of about 1 minute was that the UFO was generally stationary, oscillating \"in place.\" Suddenly the object began acceler- ating, and within 1 second was lost to view in the northeast! It moved away on a straight trajectory. No trail was seen against the clear blue sky. During the initial period, Bill had turned the car onto Rt. 12 heading south. At this point they both got a good look at the UFO through the open window (on the driver's side?) Previously they had been viewing_it through the windshield. Since neither of them wears eyeglasses, the possi- bility of seeing a reflection or distor- tion through glass is eliminated. When the object accelerated, they turned the car around and \"chased it\" down Rt. 101 to the east, but it quickly disappeared in the direction of Beech Hill toward Dublin. Beech Hill is a local landmark, rising 1040 feet high. Both people agreed the object ap- peared to be the size of a nickel held at arm's length. This apparently large diameter may have been overesti- mated due to the reflecting glare. A turboprop aircraft flew over after the object had disappeared. The plane was low because it had just left the Keene airport (Dillant Hopkins Air- port) a bit over a mile to the south of the intersection. Bill thought that the UFO was about the same size or only slightly smaller than the plane was at that altitude (probably only a few thousand feet); Kathy felt it was definitely smaller. However, they both thought the object was quite a bit farther away than the plane. They did not attempt to give any distance or size of the UFO. They heard no sound from the UFO. During the early part of the sighting they had been in the car with the engine running, but after pursuing it they had gotten out of the car. No wind was evident. The Investigation I was informed of this sighting while on another investigation in the Keene area on Sunday, Sept. 2. I ar- rived at the home of a real estate agent and former associate of a NICAP investigating group in Keene at about 6 p.m. to discuss the original investigation which he had been in- volved in. While there, he introduced me to Bill, his 22-year-old son-in-law, and Kathy, his 19-year-old daughter. They had been married about a year. During a general discussion of past local UFO reports with him and Bill, Bill voluntarily related his story to me. I listened, then decided to get details from both him and Kathy. A tape.recording was made of the inter- view. I did not have time to visit the sighting area. Conclusions Like so many areas of New Hamp- shire, Keene is rich in UFO reports. This is the first report which I know of from this immediate area during the recent flap in N.H. Most of the flap reports were from the Laconia/ Manchester areas to the east and north of Keene. It is noteworthy that this sighting happened the night after the police encounter at Sanbornton. It was mentioned that there are power lines on or near Beech Hill, which the UFO may have been over. I did not confirm this. An industrial area lies southwest of the hill, de- noted by \"Drive-In Theater\" on the map. A reservoir, Otter Brook, now lies to the northeast of the hill; it is not labeled on the map but is probably in the flat, open area 2Vz mile NE. The reservoir dam does not generate electricity. The entire area is one of marshes and hills. Negative factors of the report in- clude the fact that the witnesses are untrained, the sighting duration was brief, and no corraborating sightings have been located.

On the night of the incident, Mr. L age 26, was watching the late show on TV in the 65-foot mobile home where he and his wife, age 26, live. About 1:15 a.m. Mr. L was preparing to go to bed when he suddenly heard a strange sound outside—some sort of bum ... bum... bum, as if something had fall- en on the grass. He lifted the curtain in his living room and saw a reddish orange round object hovering over the field to the northeast side of his mobile home. The object was so luminous he could hardly look at it without hurting his eyes. Mr. L went to the bedroom to awaken his wife. While in the bed- room he heard another sound, sort of a bzzzzz. He looked out the bedroom window and saw what appeared to be an occupant, about 15 feet from the bedroom windows. The occupant was about 6 feet tall, stiff looking, of a metallic appearance, and with glow- ing red horizontal bars across its up- per body. The witness could not re- member anything about the occu pant's head. After watching the occupant in- spect the interior of a pre-f ab storage shed near the trailer (nothing was taken), Mr. L and his wife went to the living room area, where they looked out the window and saw three addi- tional occupants. The witnesses re- ferred to the occupants as \"robots\" because of the stiff way the three moved. Mr. and Mrs. L said they were very frightened at this point, and un- sure as to what they should do. As they observed the three occupants, the \"robots\" appeared to examine the shaft and wheel assembly of a mobile home which had not yet been placed on a foundation. v ' The witnesses continued to watch the activities for the next three hours, during which time they saw about 15 occupants together in one line close to the creek. The 15 stood in. a line for more than five minutes, then moved suddenly together as though by command. During the three hours of observa- tion, two freight trains passed. Mr. L described the sighting the next day to his colleagues at work, but he apparently was not believed. The local radio station picked up the story, however, and then Mr. Jean Roy made the first attempt to contact the witnesses for an investigation. He discovered three landing traces with leg imprints, and photographed them. He also interviewed the witnesses on tape. Mr. Ph. Blaquiere and Mr. Wido Hoville also investigated the sighting. At a farm down the street, a dog which reportedly barked habitually at the slightest sound had, on the night the sighting occurred, pulled out of his collar and hidden, completely afraid. An unidentified woman had also reportedly contacted the police regarding the incident, but the police had not responded. The three landing traces found were circles of 17 feet in diameter. The outer 2-foot ring of each circle contained disturbed, flattened grass. Grass in the inner circle, 15 feet in diameter, was normal. There was no indication of any burned area. One of the landing sites was found where the witnesses had reported seeing an object. The other two sites were on the other side of the creek, hidden from the view of the wit- nesses. The landing sites were still visible more than two months after the sight- ing, and the grass at the three landing sites reportedly grew twice as high as grass in the surrounding areas. According to the witnesses, a white substance was found where the robots had been, especially near the pre- fab shed visited by one of the robots. A chemical analysis of this substance is being made through MUFON, but results are not available at this time. On the morning of June 28, three days after the sighting, two men dressed in black reportedly knocked on the door of the witnesses' home. Without showing credentials, they began to ask questions about the sighting. Mr. L cut the questioning short, however, and asked the two to leave. He described them as wearing black suits, black ties, black shoes, and carrying a f ileholder. Only one of the two spoke, the language being French Canadian with no accent. They drove a car of light color, but the witness did not write down the license number. One July 10, about two weeks after the two men had asked questions, the witness observed the two driving in front of the witness' mobile home. Two women were in the car with the two men.

Boyde. while investigating a wave of UFO activity,in August heard rumors of the incident and was able to track down the individuals involved. The 'incident occurred in October of 1965., The witness, who wishes to remain ' anonymous, was returning home frpm work at 9 p.m. when he noticed a strange object in a hay field near his home in Monaca, and stopped his car to observe the object better He described it as being about 45 feet in diameter and about 20 feet high. It was shaped somewhat like an upside down bowl, and seemed to be dull silver in color. There were what appeared to be 3 portholes in the upper part of the object evenly spaced. From these openings, soft lights of varying colors could be seen. In one porthole, there were dark shadows seen moving about; how- ever, no definite form could be de- termined. The object seemed to rest a short distance above the ground on about 8 to 10 beams of light. The witness was sure that they were light sources, since he could see trees through them. After seeing this for a short time, the witness got into his car and went home after his wife with the idea of returning to the scene with her. When they returned, the object was still in the same position. The man decided to get out of the car to obtain a better look. His wife was afraid and asked him not to go. He then closed the car door, at which time the ob- ject made a sound like gushing air and it started to rise. As it gained altitude, the light beams retracted, and the witnesses were able to see the bottom of the craft. The bottom was the same color as the rest of the object, except there was a circle in the center about 10 feet in diameter that was darker than the rest of the craft. The witness returned to the scene the next day to see if he could find u This disc, which measures just over 20 inches in diameter, was found at the site where a UFO was allegedly observed. There is no known direct connection, however, between the disc and the UFO. An analysis of the metal indicates it was made of materials common to the Earth. any signs of the visitor. At the spot where the object had been, he found a metal disc 20 and 1/16 inches in diameter and 1/16 inches thick with a hole in the center and 8 small holes around the plate. The witness took it home and showed it only to his wife and brother-in-law, fearing that others would laugh at his story. The disc remained outside in his backyard for 2 years, and after that remained in a shed up until now. The witness has never claimed that the metal fell from the UFO, only that it was found at the same location after the sighting. Consultants to the WCUFOSG sub- mitted the plate to X Ray diffraction and emission spectroscopy analysis and found it to be a stainless steel — 12— alloy, very smiliar to the 400 series. A quantitative analysis showed that the metal contained 0.4% Cadmium, 8% Chromium, 0.06% Copper, 53% Iron, 0.03% Magnesium, 2% Manganese, 0.2% Molybdenum, 6% Nickel and 0.5% Silicon. Several chemists and metallurgists who worked on the sample feel that the wear marks around the edge look to be caused by cavitation. This oc- curs at a seal area where extremely high pressures exist, and the seal starts to leak. The analysis shows that the materials are all common to Earth. The area where the plate was found is out in the country and no factories were in the area at the time of the find."},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"In Others' Words By Lucius Parish The latest NATIONAL ENQUIRER UFO articles are featured in the Oct. 2 and Oct. 12 issues.

NATIONAL TATTLER for Oct. 13 has an article on the beliefs of Presi- dent Ford and Nelson Rockefeller with respect to UFOs. Both men are labeled as \"believers\" and some feel that this may be a key factor in a forthcoming release of government information on the subject. Perhaps, but this seems to me to be another of those \"don't hold'your breath until it happens\" sort of situations. The Oct. 20 TATTLER has a rehash article on UFO activity in the vicinty of War minster, England. One of the most interesting articles to appear in SAGA in quite some time may be found in the November issue. Psychic Peter Hurkos gives his \"im- pressions\" of various bits of UFO evidence, along with a prophecy about future UFO events. It would be quite intriguing to see more research of this sort done with psychics, possibly getting a \"concensus of opinion\" from several persons. The SAGA article is well worth your time. A rather questionable article on underwater objects appears in the November issue of MALE. Some of the sighting reports seem to be gen- uine, but the names and organizations mentioned are unfamiliar. The Winter issue of PROBE THE UNKNOWN contains a UFO article which is largely rehash, although it does give prominent mention to MUFON members Ted Phillips and Thomas Nicholl. If you don't mind reading about Delphos, Kan., again, it isn't too bad. Some Mexican \"little men\" stories may be found in an article in the No- vember issue of FATE. However, it is not known if these small beings have a UFO connection. Some UFO reports are used in the story and the reader is left to draw his own conclu- sions. Quite intriguing.

If so, per- haps you'd like to read Robin Collyns' DID SPACEMEN COLONISE THE EARTH?. There is a lot of familiar material here, but Collyns does man- age to come up with some new items which haven't been rehashed to death by other writers. For one thing, he speculates that the \"Garden of Eden\" may have been in Australia! Well, whether or not you think that theory has merit, he does give some in- triguing Maori legends which may have \"cosmic\" relevance. Collyns is a native of New Zealand and has ap- parently traveled to many parts of the world gathering data for his book. He quotes from various Soviet writ- ings which have not been readily available to Westerners. The book also includes an interesting photo sec- tion.

THE NEW UFO SIGHTINGS by Glenn McWane & David Graham is largely a round-up of 1972-73 sighting reports, plus chapters on UFOs in history, contactees, monsters and UFOs, Iron Curtain UFO reports, etc. The book also contains interviews with Brad Steiger, John Keel, and Ted Owens. There are also favorable mentions of MUFON and various MUFON members (McWane is also a State-Section Director).

However, the author does add some previously unreported details when he discusses such \"classic\" cases as Mantell, Chiles & Whitted, Zamora, the Coyne case, etc. This book is based on the forthcoming documentary film of the same title by Sandier Institutional Films. The most fascinating portion of the book has to be the photo section. In addi- tion to the 1973 \"eclipse UFO\" and a variety of illustrations, the section contains previously-unreleased photos from NASA files. These show a wide range of \"phe- nomena\" which were photographed on Gemini, Apollo and Skylab mis- sions. One can only hope—as rumor has it—that these are forerunners of things to come.

In the course of 16 chapters, Flindt & Binder lay out, step by step, their reasons for concluding that evolution and natural selection alone cannot possibly account for man's supposed rise from a lower form of life.

Mr. Jorma Viita, who was born in Finland and later moved to Denmark to secure employment, has sent three high quality photographs to the UFO Study Center of Finland. The follow- ing is a translation of his encounter story. \"This all happened on Feb. 15,1974 at about 5 p.m. in Odense, Denmark. The skies were clear with no clouds; the sun was just setting. I was on my way to the local karate club. I had a camera with me, because I was going to take some pictures at the club. \"I took my bicycle and drove to the main highway. At once I saw a saucer- shaped figure passing me from my left At the moment it was impossible to take a picture, because the .UFO was behind the trees. So, I turned around and started chasing the saucer on my bicycle. I drove as fast as I could for about 300 meters. \"I don't know how fast the UFO moved, but the speed of a helicopter came into my mind. Then, I stopped my bike and aimed my camera. I noticed that the saucer had stopped. I shot the first picture, after which I saw the UFO move again. I saw how it slowly turned upside down and speeded up. Then, I shot my sec- ond and third picture. On the third picture you can see the UFO upside down. Now the saucer speeded up and disappeared in a few seconds on the northeastern skies. ; \"My observation time was two to three minutes and the UFO was approximately 300 feet above the ground. Its diameter was 20 to 30 feet and its height was about six feet. It had a cabin construction with black holes on the sides. Its color was silver- grey. On the bottom I saw some sort of reddish hole with smoke around it. I also heard a humming sound. \"My camera was a Agfa Optima 500 Sensor and my film was Ilford FPT 135.

He also notes that there is apparent camera motion which blurs the background, but not the UFO, and that this mo- tion may not correspond with the description of the incident. At this time the authenticity of these photos cannot be deter- mined one way or the other. Interestingly enough, this same witness allegedly had an- other sighting and took addition- al photos of a UFO in June of this year.

Adler, may have been considered by some to be a fictional account of U.S. Air Force handling of UFO sighting reports. However, fiction it was not. A Cinemobile Production, directed by Jud Taylor and starring Glenn Ford, Bradford Dillman, and David Soul, the film was featured by NBC on Oct. 1. The story concerned the tracking of UFO's on radar by the U.S. Air Force and a Marine Corps air facility and the subsequent loss of two Marine Corps jets dispatched to investigate the objects. The two jets were visual- ly-observed to enter a cloud by the crew of a specially equipped radar observation craft (\"Flight 412\") and then simply disappear by moving off the radar scope. Attempts to \"sweep the radar sightings under the rug\" by advising the parties involved that each of their respective radars was malfunctioning were not successful. A little \"Mission Impossible\" tech- nique was employed to whisk the radar observation aircraft (Flight 412) off to an abandoned World War II airfield by a special Air Force in- telligence group for interrogation of their sighting. The holding of the crew members and their interrogation was reminis- cent of the experiences of Air Force pilots back in the 1950's. The crew of Flight 412 was retained until they had agreed that they actually had not viewed UFO's on radar or observed the two jets disappear into the cloud. Officers who did not cooperate were passed up for promotions and re- leased from the U.S.A.F. at the earliest point in their age/rank status.

Burger, occurring in 1951. George recognized many of the similarities to actual cases on file when he was reading Dr. Hynek's book and other books in his preparation for the film. (Incidentally, Dr. J. Allen Hynek commended the producers for this fine film.) The answer to the \"sixty-four thou- sand question\" was that the U.S. Air Force was not asked to approve or \"bless\" the film story, nor have they commented to the producers or writers either \"pro\" or \"con\" as of this writing. A feature of this UFO-inspired film was the first public viewing of a UFO photographed over Catalina Island in color motion pictures. It is anticipated that this movie, \"The Disappearance, of Flight 412,\" will be repeated on NBC in the future for those viewers who missed it the first time.

In making this announcement, MUFON Director Walt Andrus said the move will enable MUFON to pro- vide significant additional services to its members. The combined dues for MUFON membership and SKYLOOK subscrip- tion will be $12 per year. Persons not interested in or selected for MUFON membership may subscribe to SKY- LOOK alone for $10 per year. A por- tion of this $10 subscription price will be used for general MUFON activi- ties, so persons in this category will be designated \"Contributing Sub- scribers.\" Those subscribing or renewing subscriptions prior to Jan. 1 will pay the current subscription price of $5.00 per year. Those subscribing or renewing after Jan. 1 will pay the new rates as outlined above. All cur- rent subscriptions and renewals, in- cluding those for more than one year, will be honored until their expiration dates. The advantages of the new pro- cedure are outlined by Andrus as • follows: \"Since the organization of MUFON in May of 1969, the administrative offices in Quincy, IL., have been oper- ated with volunteers, who also had full time positions in business, indus- try, and education. We have simply outgrown this status as MUFON has emerged as one of the leading scien- tific UFO organizations in the World. We have found it impossible, under the present arrangement, to provide the essential membership services to our fine people who represent MUFON. \"When we say 'membership ser- vices,' this includes correspondence, UFO information to interested peo- ple, processing of membership appli- cations, filing of UFO sighting re- ports and forwarding specific reports to consultants or specialists, occasion- al SKYLOOK subscriptions, prepar- ing public relations 'News Releases' when appropos, and mailing MUFON Symposium Proceedings, just to name some examples. \"The solution to a portion of this problem is to hire a full time secre- tary, who will handle all of the repeti- tive functions and allow the MUFON officers sufficient time to provide the leadership and direction to the or- ganization and to conduct UFO re- search and investigations. This ob- viously will create an additional ad- ministrative expense, since no one has ever been paid by MUFON for their services. The key to our success has been the vast amount of volun- teer service provided throughout the world in the study of this fascinating enigma. \"Another major step will be taken at the same time that MUFON adds the full time secretary to it's staff- that of bringing SKYLOOK into a closer relationship to MUFON, whereby the secretary may also per- form clerical functions for our monthly publication. \"The Board of Directors of MUFON has made the decision to combine the membership dues and SKYLOOK sub- scription as one amount starting Jan. 1, 1975. As you will note, this issue of SKYLOOK has been \"type set\" giving it an even more profes- sional appearance, fitting a magazine of it's stature in the UFO field. Each of the improvements that our readers have observed since Dwight Connelly became the editor, only a few short months ago, is reflected in added costs or added time, or both. Each of these process improvements plus the continually rising cost of paper and printing has increased the cost of publishing SKYLOOK. This cost must also be reflected in MUFON's new dues structure, since SKYLOOK will no longer function financially in- dependent as it has prior to this time. \"Since membership to MUFON is accomplished by the invitation and — 18— recommendation of one of our di- rectors, an arrangement must be made to accommodate those inter- ested people who want to subscribe to SKYLOOK, but who are not active members of MUFON. \"We also want to make provisions whereby our teen-agers may partici- pate in the activities of MUFON, since these fine young people will become our Field Investigators of the future. Eighteen years of age is the minimum for a Field Investi- gator, and 21 years for a Director. Competent young people not meet- ing these age requirements are as- signed to positions titled \"SKYLOOK Reporter,\" \"UFO News CLIPPING Service,\" and in the case of amateur astronomers, \"Astronomy.\" The MUFON Board is also cognizant that these same members under 18 years of age are students and may have financial limitations; therefore they will receive preferential considera- tions with respect to membership dues. ($10.00 annually for such stu- dents) To accommodate SKYLOOK sub- scribers who are not MUFON mem- bers, on who do not wish to be actively involved in MUFON for personal rea- sons, but who have a sincere desire to help support MUFON research into the UFO phenomenon, a restricted I membership position has been es- tablished, titled \"Contributing Sub- scriber.\" A Contributing Subscriber i will be basically subscribing to SKY- LOOK as many of our readers have done in the past; however, they will i not be issued membership identifica- tion cards, since there will be no need I for same.

Friedman, \"The Flying Saucer Physicist,\" has been released for November and December. Friedman, who speaks on \"Flying Saucers Are Real,\" is the only space scientist devoting full time to UFO's. Last year he spoke on 93 campuses in 29 states. Friedman notes that he speaks at special rates for \"piggy- back\" appearances which can be given enroute to those already sched- ,uled.

(MUFON) has grown so rapidly in the past five years that positive financial steps must be taken to fulfill our obligations to our members and to meet goals and objectives that we have established as the purpose of this organization—resolving the UFO phenomenon. \"With the advent of a series of motion pictures and TV documen- taries devoted to UFO's within the next few months, the interest of the general public will increase to new levels never before experienced, creating additional demands upon MUFON in the area of informational services and public awareness pro- grams. \"It is predicted that the U.S. Gov- ernment, through one of it's agencies, will make a positive revelation of the existence of UFO's within a year. This will.open the doors to many areas of research not previously available or receptive. At the same time, MUFON must have a strong viable research organization that can meet it's own goals and objec- tives. We feel confident that the new dues will be helpful in this respect. \"Attaining a tax exempt status under the Internal Revenue Service 501 (c) (3) ruling is another objective that MUFON must achieve in 1975 so that tax deductable gifts may be accepted from donors. \"Even with the increase in dues structure, SKYLOOK is, without a doubt, still the finest monthly UFO publication available anywhere, and at a very competitive price. MUFON challenges our readers to make such a comparison in your evaluation of both SKYLOOK and MUFON. \"After Jan. 1, 1975, all dues should be mailed to MUFON at 40 Christo- pher Court, Quincy, IL., 62301 U.S.A.\" Director's Report by Walt Andrus (Continued from page 3) membc/s may receive an up-date on current and pending UFO motion pic- tures for both theaters and television in a separate article in this issue. Your Director recently met with Sherman Larsen, MUFON State-Sec- tion Director for Cook County in Illi- nois, to discuss the progress of the Center for UFO Studies. Dr. J. Allen Hynek is chairman of the Board of Directors for the Center for UFO Studies, and Sherm is the president and treasurer. As previously announced in SKY- LOOK, your Director was invited to present a slide/lecture in Sacra- mento, Calif., at the California Expo- sition Fair Grounds at 3 p.m. and 8 p.m. on Saturday, Oct. 26, under the sponsorship of the South Sacramento Lions Club and Paul W. Kelley, State- Section Director. Through the fine work of Paul C. Cerny, State Director for Northern California, and Tom Gates, Consultant in Astronomy, your Director addressed an audience at Foothills College in Los Altos Hills, Calif., at 7:30 p.m. on Oct. 25. 1974. He also had the pleasure of participating in a radio talk show via KGO in San — 19— Francisco, an ABC 50,000-watt radio station covering the west coast up to Alaska. On Sunday, Oct. 27, Mrs. Idabel Ep- person, State Director for Southern California, had an \"open house\" meet- ing in Los Angeles where your Di- rector had an opportunity to meet the majority of our MUFON people from the L.A. and surrounding area. A dozen roses to Idabel for being such a gracious hostess, and a personal thanks to all of you who attended, making my visit such an enjoyable and memorable event. Los Angeles is fortunate to have some of the finest UFO research talent in the nation combined in one locality. On Oct. 6, William H. Spaulding, MUFON State Director for Arizona and also Director for GSW-West (Ground Saucer Watch), met with a high percentage of his field investi- gators and consultants in Phoenix to discuss membership affiliation with MUFON. His presentation and a re- view of SKYLOOK by those attending was received favorably. We hope that Bill can soon start appointing State- Section Directors for various Arizona counties to represent both GSW and MUFON."},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"Astronomy Notes By Mark Herbstritt November Sky Mercury—is too close to the Sun for observation, superior conjunction be- ing on the 19th.

In addition, Kathy's father is definitely a UFO buff, and seems to have an in- exhaustible supply of local UFO yams to tell. Kathy and Bill, although seemingly sensible people, have un- avoidably been conditioned to accept UFO reality and might be apt to jump at a UFO explanation for an unusual sighting. The report, however, is unusual. The object seemed to be solid, metal- lic, and silver; the reflecting glare may have obscured the object's fea- tures. The object's rocking motions, and sudden and rapid acceleration are characteristic of the UFO phe- nomenon. The UFO was apparently close to power lines and a reservoir. The sightings occurred during a known flap period. My conclusion is that the report probably happened as stated and that an unknown aerial object was involved.

St. Louis group discusses parapsychology The regular monthly meeting of the UFO Study Group of Greater St. Louis was held Oct. 21 at the Farm & Home Savings and Loan Assn. building, 7801 Forsyth Blvd., Clayton, Mo. John Schroeder described the pur- poses of the parapsychology subcom- mittee of the Group's UFO Research committee. Mr. Schroeder discussed recent activities of the subcommittee, and spoke briefly on several matters of interest to its members—namely, the claims made by and about Uri Geller, and the ideas expounded by Dr. Jacques Vallee—in Passport tt\\ Magonia and more recently, Psychic magazine—on a possible link between UFOs and parapsychology. In an Executive Board meeting, Mr. Schroeder was appointed permanent chairman of the subcommittee on parapsychology. Bill Christian reported that since; September 15, he had received about twenty (20) telephone calls regarding possible UFO observations. Of these, all except three (3) were easily as- cribed to misperceptions or mis- identifications. Results of the September 21 sky- watch near Pacific, Mo., were dis- cussed by Frank Brown.
