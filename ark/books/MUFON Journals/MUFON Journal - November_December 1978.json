FROM THE EDITOR The New Zealand radar-visual UFO sightings reported in this issue appear to be some of the most significant cases in some time. To our knowledge, the December 31 case is the only simultaneous radar-visual-movie film report on record. Apparently some sightings of the planet Venus were mixed in during December to confuse the issue, but the radar and multiple-object reports obviously cannot be explained in astronomical terms and Venus had not risen when the movie film was taken. The glib, long-distance explanations advanced by alleged scientists nowhere near the scene do no credit to science. Clearly these were the knee-jerk reflexes of skeptics who can't be bothered with facts. Journal No. 130 was accidentally labelled \"September 1979\" on the cover; although we are catching up to schedule, we haven't advanced that fast! It was, of course, the September 1978 issue. This issue is labelled \"November-December\" and the next issue will be labelled \"January-February\" in order to bring the cover date in line with the calendar date. However, all subscribers will receive 12 issues for the subscription price as explained in the Director's Message in this issue.

The details have been derived from newspapers and tapes of radio and television interviews with pilots, air traffic controllers and the TV crew, and a personal viewing of the film. As this report is compiled on January 4, 1979, the following is the story which has unfolded so far. Further details will follow as available. It is hoped that investigators in New Zealand itself will be able to document the incidents in more depth.) It was Friday morning December 22 1 when the action began. An Argosy freight plane took off from Blenheim about midnight 21/22 December and headed south, which would take it out to sea and on its way to Christchurch. It was still over land moving toward the coast when the first UFO appeared, the plane's speed at this point being 220 knots. Captain John Handle, 45, and First Officer Keith Heine, 32, saw an object \"giving off an intense'white light, too powerful to be a vehicle's headlamps\", said Captain Handle, \"Besides, it was airborne. Its light was very intense and I could see land features lit up underneath it as it passed.\" Handle and Heine were only mildly curious and did not make a radio report. Soon after, senior radar controller John Cordy, 45; and precision talkdown controller Andy Herd, 25, were awaiting the arrival of an Air New Zealand DC-8 at Wellington airport on the North Island, when they were advised of the sighting of five lights in the Clarence River area on the South Island. Wellington got a radar fix on these lights, and the echoes were said to be very strong. They watched them for a time then called radar controllers at Christchurch airport. Christchurch also picked up the echoes. The targets apparently travelled off the coast and were moving about in a 16 km quadrant over the sea. At 3 a.m. Wellington radar picked up a large echo 48 km southeast of the city. Mr. Cordy said: \"It appeared to hover there for some time. Abruptly it moved at 120 knots to a point 80 km southeast and stayed there at least 30 minutes.\" Meanwhile the five others were still moving around in the same area. Suddenly another showed up inland. About 3:30 a.m. a second Argosy plane took off from Blenheim headed for Christchurch, flying roughly the same course. Mr: Cordy radioed Captain Vern Powell and First Officer Ian Pirie, 21, when they were 2000 m up and climbing to their ceiling of 3200 m. Wellington asked them if they could get a visual sighting of a radar target they had at 20 km starboard of the plane. The crew looked but couldn't see a thing. Within a matter of seconds they were asked to check for a sighting 40 km to port as the radar echo had apparently moved to that position. Pirie spotted a bright white light with an intermittent reddish tinge, which seemed to change hue back and forth noticeably. They approached to within several kilometers as indicated by the plane's weather radar and levelled off at 3200 m remaining on course. As they picked up speed the light remained in the same position relative to them. At times it disappeared into bits of cloud but would then emerge again as bright as before. Mr. Cordy said that these radar targets were at least as big and as solid as the Argosy plane. The crew watched the light for some 10-12 minutes before Australian TV Crew Gets First VFO Film MELBOURNE, Australia,. Dec. 31 (AP>— An Australian television station claimed to- day it has the world's first film footage of an unidentified flying object. A spokesman for the Melbourne station said the UFO was filmed flying over New Zealand yesterday. He said the British Broadcasting Co. and the CBS television network have purchased the footage for an Jinflisclosed amount. CBS said it would show the film Monday fluting its nightly news show. *«An oval-shaped object with three bands around it can be seen clearly. At one stage the film crew saw 25 of these objects/' spokesman George Wilson said here. He said the film showed blobs of light dancing about in front or and alongside the aircraft carrying the camera crew. The film was made at the .direction of sta- tion reporter Quentin Fogarty, who was checking out a UFO report by a New Zea- land Airline pilot, Wilson said. The pilot said Dec. 21 he saw strange objects while flying over Cook Strait, a narrow body of water that separates the two islands of New Zealand. Wilson said flight control at Wellington Airport confirmed that objects other than airplanes had appeared on radar screens at the time the seven-minute sequence was filmed. POST they had to turn 60° to starboard to keep on track. The object then seemed to lag behind and vanished. Wellington radar shortly afterwards lost their target. However, as the plane reached Christchurch its weather radar detected an object streaking across their path. Captain Powell got a view of a bright, flashing white light which shot past at speed. He estimated 24 km in 5 seconds making a speed of 17,000 km/h. The object turned sharp right and disappeared. Christchurch's radar sweep has a blind spot 40 km seaward from the city at that point and they were unable to confirm this object. Meanwhile, the first Argosy plane (continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"(New Zealand, Continued) had taken off from Christchurch and was heading for Auckland at the top of the North Island, on a direct route which took it up the South Island's east coast. It had already passed the second plane when Wellington radar asked Captain Handle to watch for any of the UFOs. At first they saw nothing, then they spotted the five objects still offshore from the Clarence river area. Mr. Cordy said: \"Captain Randle radioed that he was turning around for a better look. He reported, 'Yes, we can see them...they're white tinged with amber...passing 16 km south of us...they're reflecting on the water...definitely not distress flares...estimate 150 meters above the water.'\" The first plane completed an orbit around the objects before it resumed its northerly course. Captain Randle said: \"As we flew on we saw on our own radar what appeared to be three large surface vessels moving down the South Island coast, very close inshore. Then we got a visual sighting on them. Two carried lights the other didn't. One of them appeared to be in shoaling waters. The whole thing was strange because you couldn't consider that stretch of coast safe for any kind of shipping in any circumstances.\" December.30-31, 1978 This was all the activity until Saturday, December 30, when a similar event occurred. A Safeair four-engined turbo-prop Argosy, piloted by Captain Bill Startup, -*vith co-pilot Bob Guard, took off from Wellington at 11:20 p.m. and headed towards Christchurch. On board were a TV crew consisting of reporter Quentin Fogarty, freelance cameraman David Crockett and his wife Ngaire, who were taking the flight to recreate the incident of the previous week for a documentary. The first contact came 10 minutes after takeoff when the plane was some 40 km south of Wellington. Capt. Startup said: \"We saw five or six lights at different angles\", which were visible to their front. They contacted Wellington and asked control if they had any targets, and were advised in the affirmative. From then on the plane and control kept up a mutual conversation. During the 400 km journey along the east coast of the South. Island various lights were seen at different times. The exact sequence and descriptions are very difficult to obtain, from the media reports which tend to confuse details and times, failing to mention directions and elevations almost entirely. However, it is apparent that — (a) At one stage a bright light suddenly appeared off the starboard wing and was filmed. The film, shot from the co- pilot's seat using a 250 mm lens shows a white light which quickly assumes the shape of a sphere. Several times it flattens out somewhat. This light was also apparently picked up by Wellington radar, and on the plane's 40 km radius radar. (b) Wellington control called the plane and informed them that they had a target behind the plane. Mr. Causer of control declared that: \"As the plane turned, I advised him his target now appeared to be in formation with him. The plane's return blip had doubled its size on the screen. This persisted for about five sweeps of the radar then the plane signal suddenly returned to normal. \"Captain Startup said: \"Air Traffic Control told us there was an object about one mile behind us, and I turned the plane around to have a look. We spotted something which kept accelerating to get close to us and would then fall back. I know of no plane which could carry out such a maneuver. We made a two-minute orbit, then continued the run because we didn't want to push our luck.\" The plane landed at Christchurch and Mrs. Crockett left the plane as she was \"frightened\" according to her husband. A local TV reporter Mr. Dennis Grant flew with them in lieu, for the return trip to Blenheim. Capt. Startup relates that: \"As we were climbing out of Christchurch at 3,000 feet I spotted a light travelling parallel to us. We turned 90 degrees and got within 10 miles of it. It overtook us, stayed above us, came in front and then shot away.\" Mr. Grant was quoted as saying that he saw a great spherical light with varying intensity. After gaining height and when at 4,000m, Capt. Startup commented: \"We were at 4,000m and flying over the sea. Suddenly there was this bright, very bright light. It was like a sphere all lit up. It wasn't shining in our face like a searchlight, but the light was reflected on the sea.\" Subsequent Developments On Monday, January 1, 1979, a New Zealand Defence spolesman said that one or two Skyhawk fighter bombers would be \"scrambled\" if the Wellington radar picked up any more positive targets. The spokesman said: \"We do not consider there is a defence threat. But its all very interesting.\" . Wellington airport's chief controller said: \"It's got us guessing. We have all been skeptical about flying saucers, but there must be something up there.\" Wellington radar apparently picked up more mystery blips on their screens early on January 1. One officer said they lasted only seconds, \"But despite this brief appearance and faintness, they registered as something travelling at speed.\" The Australian Air Force asked for a copy of the film, and later the New Zealand Air Force adivsed that an Orion patrol plane crammed with sophisticated radar equipment would circle the area from 8 p.m. to 5 a.m. This it apparently did on the following two nights. The film was immediately released to the UK, U.S.A., Australia, and New Zealand and was viewed personally by me in a 20 minute special on January 2. The actual film taken lasted about 6 minutes, and shows mainly one light which the camerman zooms in and out from, interspersed with which they showed some frozen frame shots, and enlargements of these. The source appears as a whiteish bright light against a dark background. Occasionally the light would pulse and once or twice it faded almost to nothing then came back as bright as ever. My initial impression was that I was viewing an astronomical source at low elevation with the naked eye, with some atmospheric scintillation and looming effects evident. Mr. D. Mabin, the head of the Mt. John observatory, 300 km from the area of sightings, said that the UFOs almost certainly were the planet Venus,"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Eric McNae, Air Traffic Service Controller: \"At one stage our radar controllers had five very strong radar targets (echoes) where nothing should have been — if anything should have been there we would have known about it.\" Capt. John Randle, Argosy co-pilot, on the December 22 Clarence River radar-visual sightings: \"They were close to shore and unusually bright. In one case the light appeared to be lighting up both ground and sea surfaces.\" while in Sydney, Australia, Dr. D. Cole, an atmospheric physicist, said false radar echoes were a natural feature of the ionosphere in summer and said that the light could have been caused by refraction in the pre-dawn sky. Sir Bernard Lovell, British astronomer, was quoted as saying the UFOs were most probably meteors, while Patrick Moore believed they could have been some kind, of reflection, a balloon or an unscheduled aircraft. Elsewhere both the planets Jupiter, visible in the evening sky in the northeast, and the planet Venus, visible in the morning sky in the east, were cited as causes for the observations. Jupiter 2 was said to be the culprit on the film. However, Capt. Startup was adamant that the object filmed was hot a reflection or a shot of Venus, as he said: \"We could see Venus at the same time. At one stage Venus was behind the object, and we could see both at the same time. Then later the UFO was on our starboard side and Venus was on the left-hand side of the aircraft and quite high up.\" Summary . Overall, we have several seperate sequences of events on two completely different occasions but all in the same general area. Visual observations, as well as radar targets were evident, plus a film was taken. Suggestions have been made that the radar images were anomalous propagation effects, that the visual objects were astronomical in origin, and that the film was of Jupiter. There are points for and against these suggestions, and much more detailed investigation needs to be undertaken by someone on the spot. The most essential details so far missing are the azimuth and elevations of both visual and radar targets, and the positions of Venus and Jupiter at the time. LATE NEWS A second film has been taken by a New Zealand film crew from the ground in the early hours of January 3, 1979. ; Appro*. Argosy. H ' This film shows a round, glowing ball with a bright light, which faded and brightened. It was not picked up on radar by the Wellington, Christchurch airports nor by the RNZAF Orion which was patrolling the area. Doubts have therefore been expressed that the film shows little more than the planet Venus. Squadron leader Ray Carran, who was flying the Orion at the time, said that a large Japanese fishing fleet was operating 160 km off the coast and \"Was putting up an awful lot of light-.\" He also stated that he and his crew checked 14 unexplained radar observations, some of which were found upon inspection to be pockets of turbulence.

Vern Powell, Argosy pilot, to Air Traffic Control: \"Something is coming toward us at a tremendous speed on our radar....It has now abruptly veered off.\" The object was visible as a \"flashing white light.\" Capt. Bill Startup, Safcair pilot on flight that filmed UFO: \"We could see Venus at the same time. At one stage Venus was behind the object, and we could see both at the same time.\" December 22, 1978 About midnight of Dec. 21/22--Argosy freighter plane (Capt. Handle & F/O Heine) took off from Blenheim enroute south to Christchurch. While still over land moving toward coast, saw brilliant light illuminating ground beneath. About 1:20 AM--Wellington airport radar (Cordy & Herd) detected 5 objects (also sighted visually and on Christchurch radar) moving around off coast near Clarence River area. About 3:00 AM--Wellington radar detected a \"large echo\" hovering about 48 km southeast of city, then moving abruptly to 80 km southeast (meanwhile, the 5 objects continued moving around off coast and a sixth showed up inland). About 3:30 AM--A second Argosy aircraft (Capt. Powell & F/O Pirie) took off from Blenheim enroute to Christchurch on approximately same course as first. Asked by ground radar to investigate a radar target, they first saw nothing; then the \"blip\" moved to a new position and the crew saw a bright white light tinged with red, also showing on their weather radar. Ground radar showed a \"blip\" as large and solid as that of the aircraft that kept pace with the plane for about 19 km. The plane approached within several kilometers as measured on radar. -- Later near Christchurch, the aircraft weather radar detected an object moving rapidly across their path and Capt. Powell saw a bright, flashing white light shoot past and make a sharp right turn before disappearing. He estimated its speed as 17,000 km/h. The first Argosy, meanwhile, was 6 enroute back up the east coast of South Island and had passed the second aircraft when the crew saw the 5 objects still moving around offshore of the Clarence River area, their light reflecting off the water. The aircraft radar showed what appeared to be 3 large surface vessels close offshore and the crew spotted some lights visually that corresponded; however, the objects were in an area considered unsafe for shipping of any king. December 30-31, 1978 UFO Film from Aircraft 11:20 PM--Safeair Argosy (Capt. Startup & co-pilot Guard) left Wellington enroute to Christchurch carrying a TV crew (Fogarty & Mr. & Mrs. Crockett) to recreate the sightings of the previous week. 11:30 PM--40 km south of Wellington 5 or 6 lights appeared ahead of the aircraft in different locations, confirmed by ground radar. - A bright light appeared off the starboard wing and was filmed through a 250 mm lens; object confirmed by ground and airborne radar. -- Later, an object was detected by ground radar following the aircraft; Capt. Startup turned the plane around to look and saw an object that kept accelerating closer to the plane and then falling back. -- Mrs. Crockett, said by her husband to be \"frightened,\" left the plane in Christchurch. On the return flight, a large spherical light paced the plane, hovering above it, then pulled in front and shot away. Its light was reflected off the sea. January 1,1979 More radar targets of fast-moving objects. A New Zealand Air Force Orion patrol plane, equipped with sophisticated radar, circled the area for the next two nights. January 3,1979 In the early morning, a second film was taken by a New Zealand film crew on the ground. There were no radar targets, and the film probably shows the planet Venus.

The unfortunate witness is Mr. Hideichi Amano (29) who operates a snack bar called \"Juri\" after the name of his baby daughter. On that night, having stationed his mobile unit car on the top of a mountain nearby to get an unobstructed reception of wireless waves, he indulged in communicating with his younger brother in another part of Japan, far in Yamanashi Prefecture, beginning around 8:30 p.m. After finishing his communication with his brother, he chatted with his local ham friends for some time and then wanted to go down the mountain, when he found that the inside of the car suddenly became very bright. He turned around toward the back seat and found the inside of the car illuminated ten times more brighty than the usual fluorescent lamp fixed on the ceiling there. (He had fixed a fluorescent lamp on the ceiling of the back seat of his car, instead of the usual room lamp.) Highly surprised, he stuck his neck out of the side window of his driver's seat and tried to locate the source of the light. Not only he could I not locate the source of the light, but he was flabbergasted to find that the ultra bright light was restricted inside the car only and no light was leaking out of the , car windows. He found at this time that his 2- Hideichi Amano, humanoid witness year-old daughter, Juri, who had been a short while before standing on the driver's seat beside him, was lying there with foam at her mouth. Then he found a strange, round orange-colored light illuminating his stomach area. Mystified, he traced back the light through the windscreen outside of the car and found it originated at a point in the dark night sky. At that very moment, he sensed a metallic object pressed tight to his right temple and having looked sideways with fear, he found a very weird, unearthly creature standing there! It was projecting a metallic pipe-like device from its mouth and pressing its front edge tightly to his temple and communicating something incessantly through it to his brain by strange, voiceless, high-pitched noises, which sounded somewhat like a high- speed play back of a recorded tape. The eerie creature's face was round, with no neck, and depressed in his forehead to form a triangle there. Its ears were rather big and sharp in their upper edges, and he could not locate the nose in its face. Although it had two eyes, they were very small and motionless and appeared to be glowing in bluish white, like two miniature lamps. Its mouth, which was either projecting into a pipe or holding a pipe as mentioned above, was quite ambiguous to him, as it was quite difficult for him to spy the mouth sideways in such position. He was shocked and frightened and wanted to flee from the place, and he tried to start the car, but the engine did not respond properly and he could not put on the headlights either. In the meantime, the strange noise like a crazy \"space message\" continued to flow into his brain. He was terrified and could not move, and sensed that his brain became gradually vaguer and vaguer. After about 4-5 minutes in this state, the figure of the strange creature faded out gradually and the strange round orange light on his stomach also disappeared, and the dazzling bright light inside the car returned to the normal brightness, too. Then, the headlights came to life and suddenly the (Continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"(Japanese Humanoid, Continued) car radio and car stereo began to sound loudly. (Later his watch was found to have stopped at 9:37 p.m.) Realizing that the fearful situation had returned to normal, he tried the engine and having found that it worked, he ran away from the spot at once and descended the mountain road frantically. In retrospect, he remembers that he ran away from the place at full speed, without even caring about the condition of his little daughter until he reached the foothill of the mountain, when his daughter woke up and stood up, saying \"I want water, papa!\" On his way back, he worried about whether he should report this incident to the police or not, as he may not be believed, but he decided to report it and dropped in at the police station. But, as he had expected, they did not believe his story and made fun of him. So, he returned home, arid having handed his daughter, who was already sleeping, to his wife, as she was still keeping the bar (which is open up to 2:00 a.m. every day), and crept into his bed, complaining that he had a very severe headache. The TV crew, who had investigated this affair, obtained Amano's permission to have him hypnotized by a professional hypnotist, by the name of Mr. Akio Moribe, to ascertain the validity of the occurrence and to delve into his memory further. During the first hypnotic session, which was videotaped and shown on a screen, many things hidden in his memory were said to have been recovered. The most sensational thing among them was that he remembered having been asked by the creature to come back again on a certain day to the same spot to meet him again. This part was deleted from the video tape and the exact day was not mentioned in the program, in order to avoid many curious persons flocking to the spot on that day to share the meeting and to spoil the meeting, but the program assured the viewers that if the meeting proved to be successful, it will be shown on TV in the same program. Toward the end of the hypnotic session, another seemingly important fact came to light. Pressed hard for more information by the hypnotist, he 8 Amano's sketch of humanoid creature uttered a word, which could be interpreted to mean \"rosary\", from which the experimenters inferred that although he did not remember it consciously, he was given a glass rosary by the being during the encounter and although it was still kept hidden by him unconsciously somewhere around him, when the day comes when he would meet the being again, if he \"rings\" the rosary, the being would return in front of him. Although this is very interesting information, I doubt its authenticity very much, because the hypnotist's insistence for more information was too severe and I presume that the witness may have been impelled to create such a story unconsciously, and I do not believe that the creature would return again on the designated date, as I am afraid that this may also be an unconscious concoction of the witness's romantic mind. Anyway, the witness said after the hypnotic session that although he did not remember what he said during the session, he saw a \"bracelet\" instead of a \"rosary\" during the half-conscious period after the termination of the hypnotic introgation. So, the TV crew decided that the item he was given was a kind of crystalline bracelet and it was still hidden somewhere around him without his remembering it, but ultimately he would remember it and when he \"rings\" it, or vibrates it on the top of the same mountain on the day designated by the being (I know the date, as he confided to me about it when ultimately I interviewed him in his house, but I would not reveal it now. - JIT), the humanoid would return again to him to reveal further information to him. The crew is planning to attend the meeting secretly and to catch the scene on video to show to the viewers. Although I doubt its success very much, I believe this encounter is one of the most outstanding UFO incidents — in fact, the strangest — in this country. After the above TV show, I met the witness in his house, after repeated long-distance calls to him, and interviewed him with one of our able investigators on November 15, 1978, and many interesting details were revealed in the conversation. Based on such details, this incident appears more authentic to me, but poses more mysteries, and I will discuss the possibilities (at least four hyptheses) with full details of the incident revealed during my interview of him in my follow- up report. I believe this is the most authentic and interesting humanoid encounter case in Japan since two 7- year-bld boy's encounter in Kofu City on February 23, 1975.

The fuss began Friday night October 20 when trooper Gary Williams of the state police went to the home of Mr. Romeo Miller to look at two mysterious lights in the clear, black sky. Eventually 13 witnesses gathered for several hours to marvel at the objects described as, \"brighter than the brightest star.\" As seen through binoculars and a telescope, the objects appeared to change color over a wide range of hues and held their position among the stars. By Saturday the story was out in the Charleston Gazette and that night UFOs were reported from the Huntington area to the west, all around Charleston, and as far east as Morgan county. The Kanawha County sheriffs office alone received over 30 calls from excited residents. An informal group gathered again at Miller's residence along with the photographer for the police, Sydney Boggs. He managed to acquire some black and white pictures with the help of a 500mm telephoto lens and Tri-X film. Meanwhile the police had alerted the flight control supervisor, William Givens, at the Charleston airport. He was.able to find three unidentified returns from a sector near the home of Mr. Miller but at a high altitude. Checks with Air Route Traffic Control and the military failed to turn up an identification for the returns. The Sunday Charleston Gazette carried the dramatic account of UFOs over the state capital as tracked on radar and witnessed visually by many police officers and \"solid citizens of the county.\" That night additional sightings poured in from south of Charleston and two additional photographers had some success in capturing images on film.       i On Monday October 23, newspapers all over the state were carrying UFO articles and the rash of sightings moved north to the Parkersburg area where a repeat of the Charleston experience seemed to engulf many law enforcement officers who reported multicolored lights in the night sky. As if by design the reports moved further north and finished up in the northern panhandle of West Virginia when, again, police officers reported seeing a huge craft the size of a football field Friday night November 3. MUFON Investigation David Bodner, MUFON's investigator in southern West Virginia, drove to Charleston to talk with the personnel at the airport. Bill Givens described in detail his observation of three unidentified returns from Saturday night. A correlation of his account with thosetof the eyewitnesses disclosed such glaring discrepancies that a radar-visual designation for this case had to be ruled out. At no time did the unknown returns behave in a manner beyond the normal performance of helicopters. Although the radar returns remain formally unidentified, they cannot be linked with the many visual reports and should not be considered significant. Mr. Bodner's detailed data on the radar reports is on file and serves to illustrate Philip Klass's \"UFOlogical principle number nine\"; it states: If a sighted UFO is reported to a radar operator, almost invariably an unknown target will be found. (Of course we investigators know not to carry that principle to its debunking extreme, a practice unfortunately hot observed by its originator!) A series of attempts to secure photographs taken by the various photographers for analysis have failed as of the time of writing. The principal Area of W. Virginia \"flap\" showing location of Spencer with respect to Charleston. reason for this difficulty may be the crashing fall of a laughter curtain on Wednesday October 25 when newspapers around the state cited \"authorities\" as having identified the UFO sightings. Robert Brown of the National Radio Astronomy Observ- atory glibly proposed an explanation based upon the rapid change in temperature that had just occurred as a result of a cold front. Oddly, he discounted the extraterrestrial hypothesis because there were radar returns and any alien craft would be able to disguise itself from radar detection!

This exotic case is similar to a West Virginia CE-II that has only now come to light after 5 years. Just after dark on a Monday in October of 1973, Mrs. Mary Rose of Wilcoe and her 11-year-old son Teddy were walking home from a visit to Teddy's grandmother. They recajl seeing the full moon and had approached some power lines when a low flying object with bright lights came up from behind. At first Teddy thought he was seeing a helicopter but the quiet humming noise given off by the thing quickly killed that idea. Mrs. Rose found herself idly comparing the scene with the abstract beauty of an accident involving bright lights. By now the two witnesses were directly under the power lines and the object had positioned itself directly above the wires. They could make out a silver whitish disc about 20 feet in diameter associated with bright spotlights. The colors were reported as red, purple, and greenish blue. Mrs. Rose recalls a feeling of considerable fear as two silver metallic prongs lowered toward them from below the craft. She sensed that the disc was from outer space and had plans to capture them; the lowering prongs were giving off a sensation described as heat-like (or possibly electrostatic). The two witnesses were sufficiently spooked to run 20 yards for the protection of a tool shed. For ten minutes they hid under the shed on the ground. Mrs. Rose buried her face in her arms. During this time the object left and the witnesses took half an hour to compose themselves after the experience. (West Virginia \"Flap\", Continued) report over station WOAY confidently stated that he has been unable to uncover a single shred of evidence to indicate alien visitation and he should know because he is in contact with experts at the astrophysical laboratory in Cambridge. They pointed out that a meteor shower had just occurred which explains everything. Finally the chairman of the physics department at Marshall University in Huntington, West Virginia, declared that the objects could have been the result of optical looming. (We can rule that one out on many grounds including the inadequate temperature inversion reported by the weather bureau in Huntington for Saturday night.) Some of the witnesses have become quite sullen about all of this armchair theorizing by experts and do not wish to say any more about their experiences. Once again ridicule has buried data. One of the photographs taken by Sydney Boggs can be seen in an article covering the West Virginia flap for UFO 10 REPORT magazine. It bears a resemblance to an over-enlarged star trail that would be expected from a time exposure. At the time that MUFON investigator Wayne Laporte wrote the article, it was not yet certain in our minds whether the objects were actually stars. His accurate and cautious report was rather heavily hyped up by the editor of UFO REPORT so that we could read about the \"UFO Siege\" of one of the \"most intense flaps in UFO history\" which this one certainly was not. A principal witness, Romeo Miller, was finally located and he rather hurriedly dismissed the whole affair as being much ado about stars. For 2 weeks after that first Friday night he watched those same objects night after night following the motion of the heavens until it was quite clear in his own mind that his group had in fact been taken in for a while by particularly bright stars on two unusually clear nights. Sydney Boggs recalled the location of the objects which indeed correspond to the brightest stars out at that time: Capella in the constellation Auriga, Vega in the constellation Lyra, and for a while Arcturus in the constellation Bootes. When looking at these stars for a period of time one can see that scintillations of the atmosphere appear to change their color as if different lights were flashing on and off. The West Virginia flap is a fascinating example of just how a group of sober and experienced witnesses can become caught up in a UFO fever watching stars. It is likely that they understand this now and do not wish any further publicity. Miller has no \"debunkers block\" when it comes to UFOs, and in fact apparently really saw a cigar-shaped thing about 10 years ago which brings up the second half of the West Virginia flap; investigation uncovered a few cases that were definitely not stars, or anything else identifiable for that matter! These reports will be discussed in Part 2."},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"UFO RELATED INFORMATION FROM THE FBI FILE - Part 7 By Bruce S. Maccabee MUFON State Director for Maryland (Copyright Bruce S. Maccabee, 1978) In his letter to Col. Rees, dated May 23, 1950, Dr. La Paz 1 reiterated arguments that he had presented as early as December 1948 which led him to believe that the green fireballs were not natural meteors. Briefly, these arguments are the following: (1) the paths of many of the fireballs were apparently horizontal; (2) the fireballs appeared to be travelling at unusually low altitudes (i.e., far below 40 miles above the earth's surface, which is the minimum altitude that is \"normally observed\"); (3) the velocity of green fireballs seemed to be lower than normal; (4) there were usually no noises associated with the fireballs, but \"normal meteorites that penetrate to as low levels. . . are always accompanied by very violent noises\"; (5) the green fireballs had an almost constant brilliance as long as they were seen, unlike normal fireballs that show considerable brightness fluctuations; (6) whereas normal meteors travel on paths that are \"directed towards all points of the compass,\" with the green fireballs \"there is a very pronounced tendency for the paths to come in from the north half of the sky\"; (7) \"The three groups of anomalous greenish luminous phenomena show a curious association with well known meteor showers, although none of these meteor showers normally produce extremely bright green fireballs... This relationship might indicate an attempt to render the green fireballs less conspicuous by causing them to appear only when there is considerable meteoric activity.\" (8) The green color itself was anomalous. It was the color of flame-excited copper salts, \"a color rarely observed in the case of genuine meteors.\" (9) 'The duration estimates of between 2 and 3 seconds reported for the green fireballs are considerably longer than those (0.4-0.5 seconds) for 1. Dr. Lincoln La Paz is an expert on meteorites. the ordinary visual meteors, but shorter than the duration estimates invariably reported in the case of a genuine meteorite fall (5 to 30 seconds or even longer)\"; and (10) \"For none of the green fireballs has a train of sparks or a dust cloud been reported. This contrasts sharply with the behavior noted in case of meteoric fireballs — particularly those that penetrate to very low levels were the green fireball of December 12 (1948) was observed.\" Following this list of differences between the green fireballs and ordinary meteors, Dr. La Paz pointed out that since the list had been made, on December 20, 1948, many more observations had supplied information on the green fireballs. As a result of the new information he wanted to modify only one of his early statements of the differences. In particular, some observations in late 1949 and early 1950 described the fireballs as appearing to fall straight down. Thus he wanted to modify the previously listed reason (1) to include the fact that \"a strictly vertical infall is also very rarely observed in the case of genuine meteor falls.\" Also as a result of the new information, Dr. La Paz wanted to add an eleventh item to his list. The eleventh item concerned the time distribution of green fireballs as compared with meteors and meteorites. \"The graphs of frequency versus local time which accompanies the present report shows that the maximum frequency of sighting of green fireballs (occurring at approximately 2030) coincides in time with neither the frequency maximum for ordinary meteors (occurring at approximately 0300) nor the frequency maximum for meteorite falls (occurring at approximately 1600).\" Not referred to by Dr. La Paz, but shown in his graph, was the time distribution for the objects referred to as \"disk or variation.\" The maximum frequency time for disks was around 1600 (4:00 PM). After listing all these differences between normal meteors/meteorites and green fireballs, Dr. La Paz once more brought up his Russian missile theory (which he had initially stated in early 1949). He pointed out that most of the green fireballs had been seen between 5 PM and 11 PM, \"which extends from about 7AM to 1 PM in the Ural region of the USSR.\" \"Since missiles moving with velocities of the order of those found for the green fireballs for which real path determinations have been possible would travel from the Southern Urals to New Mexico in less than 15 minutes, a possible interpretation of the concentration of sightings referred to... is that the green fireballs result from guided missiles launched from bases in the Urals in the morning hours before cloudiness due to convection or blinding afternoon storms can interfere with non-radar tracking, such as has been used by the Optical Trajectory Section at White Sands Proving Ground.\" Dr. La Paz also mentioned the interesting fact that most of the green fireballs were seen during the four, days, Friday, Saturday, Sunday and Monday, with Saturday and Sunday being the peak days. Dr. La Paz then made his only direct reference to \"disks\" in the following paragraph: It is a curious and fairly well-established fact that there has been a distinct decline in the number of green fireball sightings during the last two months, within which the number of so-called \"flying saucer\" incidents in this region has attained an all-time high. In closing his letter, Dr. La Paz made a series of recommendations for investigations that should be undertaken if the military was sure that none of the green fireballs/disks were U.S. government experimental (Continued on next page) _ _"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"(FBI Files, Continued) devices. Of course, as diligent readers of the FBI file information are aware, the Air Force had no experimental missiles that resembled either green fireballs or flying disks. Apparently the Air Force accepted Dr. La Paz's recommendation and contracted with Land-Air, Inc. to do research which would supplement the Air Force's Project Twinkle, which had begun about a year before. 68 As part of the new effort to obtain data on unconventional aircraft the Air Force sent out another official request for information on September 8,1950. It was entitled \"Reporting of Unconventional Aircraft\" and was signed by Major General C.P. Cabell, Director of Intelligence, USAF. The document began with the following paragraph 69 : The United State Air Force has a continuing requirement for the reporting and technical analysis of observations of unconventional aircraft which might indicate an advance in technological progress of a foreign power. An unconventional aircraft, within the meaning of this directive, is defined as any aircraft or airborne object which by performance, aerodynamic characteristics, or unusual features, does not conform to any presently known aircraft type. The request then listed the manner in which information was to be reported and the types of information required. Basically the reporting method and the desired information were the same as given in the previously issued Intelligence Memorandum Number 4 of February 15, 1949. The request ended with the statement, \"It is desired that no publicity be given this reporting or analysis activity.\" Thus even though the Air Force, often claimed that nothing was \"hidden,\" it is clear that it didn't want its interest in UFO activity openly admitted. About a month later Mr. Ladd wrote a memorandum to update the green fireball situation for the FBI. Dated October 9, 1950, the memorandum read as follows: 70 You wiU recall that on August 23, 1950, I furnished to you a memorandum regarding Project Twinkle set up by the Department of the Air Force, with the assistance of Land-Air, Inc. at Vaughn, New Mexico, for the purpose of obtain- ing data regarding these unusual aerial phenomena which had been seen in the vicinity of sensitive installations in New Mexico. To date the 12 Air Force has not advised us of any new developments in connection with this project. Mr. , Project Engineer of Project Twinkle, has been contacted by the Albuquerque Office and arrangments have been made in order that the Bureau will be advised in the event any information relative to these phenomena indicates any jurisdiction on the part of the Bureau. According to Bureau files, an average of approximately three or four complaints have been received per month from June through September .(note by present author: the FBI referred to UFO reports as \"complaints\" about flying discs, flying saucers, green fireballs, etc.). These complaints were brought to the attention of OSI. A review of Bureau files does not indicate that there has been any increase in the sightings of these phenomena during or as a result of the war in Korea. 2 You will recall the investigation to. obtain information concerning these aerial phenomena is the jurisdiction of the Department of the Air Force. The Department of the Air Force is aware of our jurisdiction in matters relating to espionage, sabotage and internal security, and we have contacted OSI and requested them to. advise us of any developments in connection with these phenomena which would be of interest to us as a result of our jurisdiction. The Bureau has been advised in the past by OSI that many of the sightings reported to them were determined by investigation to have been of weather balloons, falling stars, meteorological phenomena and other air-borne objects.. Bureau liasion determined on the morning of October 9, 1950, from OSI headquarters that investigations of these aerial phenomena are being handled by OSI, Wright Field, Ohio. Their investigation of these phenomena fails to indicate that the sightings involved space ships or missiles from any other planet or country. According to OSI, the complaints received by them liave failed to indicate any definite pattern of activity. OSI further advised they are closely following the investigation of the captioned matters, and they will advise this Bureau of any matters of interest. With regard to the continuing Air Force interest in UFOs, only ten days later Mr. Ladd received a memordum from another agent which read as follows\": The matter of flying saucers was discussed by Special Agent —— with Major General Joseph F. Carroll of OSI on October 16,1950, at which time General Carroll advised that insofar as he has been able to determine the Air Force is not working on any type of \"flying saucer\" or \"flying disk.\" General Carroll stated that the Air Force is working on high altitude rockets and jet aircraft. He stated these experiments may account for some of the reports concerning flying saucers but that the Air Force is not apparently working on anything which is the cause of many flying saucers reports. He stated that the Air Force program for investigating reports concerning flying saucers, etc., has been reinstated at Wright Field and that any pertinent'information of interest coming to his attention will be furnished to the Bureau. Pity the poor Air Force. Despite all public pronouncements about their explanations of UFOs as mundane objects or misidentifications, UFOs would not go away. First the Air Force set up Project Sign and found that most of the reports could be explained, even though there was sufficient reason to continue the study. Then the Air Force ended Project Sign and set up Project Grudge, which was to continue the evaluation of UFO reports. Project Grudge, along with Dr. J. Allen Hynek, concluded that some reports were too bizarre to be explained astronomically, but that most could be explained in some way or another and that therefore probably all reports could be explained. Project Grudge issued a long report in the summer of 1949, and then Grudge was officially \"killed\" and its death was announced publicly in December of 1949, shortly after Major Keyhoe's famous article in True Magazine was published. The Air Force told the FBI in March 1950 that the special project to study flying saucers had been terminated in late 1949 because \"after two years of investigation over three- fourths of the invidents .... proved to be misidentifications . . . ,\" K In May 1950, the FBI received from the Air Force a sort of summary of research on flying saucers (probably a press release) 72 . This document mentioned Ezekiel's \"wheel,\" Sweden's ghost rockets, and the 1947 flap. With regard to the reports since 1947, the document states that: \"The USAF for a long time conducted a thorough investigation of each of hundreds of incidents involved. It found that approximately 75% of the reports could definitely be related to known causes such as meteorological balloons, aircraft, meteors, and other phenomena. A public statement was issued debunking the entire existence of flying disks or saucers. This did little to cut down the flood of reports. It only resulted in convincing a large number of people that the National Military Establishment was trying to cover up 2. Note: On June 25, 1950, the North Korean Armies crossed the 38th parallel into South Korea."},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"our own experiments with new weapons.\" The document then lists the \"popular\" theories: spaceships, atomic powered Soviet missiles, U.S. experiments, natural phenomena, and mass hysteria or other psychological causes. The document ruled out the spaceship explanation \"on reasonable grounds\" by pointing out that the existence of life \"on other planets is extremely tenuous and debatable.\" Moreover, \"The level of technical achievement required to launch piloted or pilotless missiles from one planet to another and return is several orders of magnitude beyond that existing on earth today and probably would have resulted in firm contact prior to this, either through deliberate landings or unscheduled crashes.\" In other words, spaceships are ruled out because if \"they\" do not do what we would expect \"them\" to, then \"they\" do not exist. After throwing out spaceships, the article proceeded to throw out Soviet weapons because the Soviets could not have been that far ahead of \"us\" (e.g., atomic powered planes), and even if they were, there would be no reason to design planes that look different from conventional planes (i.e., atomic powered planes would still have wings and a fuselage). The article also stated that the U.S. Government was not working on any aircraft that even remotely resembled a \"flying saucer.\" Thus this document concluded that \"The continued reporting of aerial phenomena must then be attributed to a mass hysteria caused by the present tenseness in the international situation; the public belief in the ability of science to accomplish miracles; and to statements in the press by \"name\" individuals hinting at the existence of some new weapon.\" (On May 16,1950, Capt. Eddie Rickenbacker made the following public statement:, \"There must be something to them, for too many reliable persons have made reports on them. I am duty bound not to say what I know about them — or what I don't know about them. However, if they do exist, you can rest assured that they are ours.\") This document was probably issued by the Air Force to counteract the publicity given to Rickenbacker's statement because it was received by the FBI only three days later and because it ended with a direct reference to Rickenbacker's statement as follows: \"Such statements of the type attributed to Rickenbacker, often solicited in the most sensational form by news reporters in order to make a good story, make people watch the sky and any object they cannot immediately recognize is called a 'flying object.' This helps to maintain the 'chain reaction' of such reports.\" Pity the poor Air Force. Mass hysteria caused by the \"present tenseness in the international situation,\" referring to the Korean War, was not a sufficient explanation. Mr. Ladd of the FBI pointed out in a memo dated October 9, 1950, that \"A review of Bureau files does not indicate that there has been any increase in sightings of these phenomena during or as a result of the war in Korea.\" In fact, the Air Force files, according to Special Report #14 73 , showed the number of reports per month decreasing from March through May 1950. (The total number of reports for 1950 was 306, as compared with 395 for 1949. Many reports for these two years were \"green fireball\" reports. 73 Pity the poor Air Force. Mass hysteria would not explain the incidents of \"green fireballs and discs\" over the southwestern military installations in 1949 and 1950. Mass hysteria would not have been an acceptable explanation for Dr. La Paz,\" who pointed out the interesting fact that a \"distinct decline in the number of green fireball sightings during the last two months\" was accompanied by an increase in the number of flying saucer sightings to an \"all-time high\" in the southwest. 67 Pity the poor Air Force; UFOs would not go away despite repeated attempts at \"debunking\" them. Every time the Air Force ended a UFO study project it had to start a new one. And, during the periods when there was no special UFO study group, UFO reports were studied by members of the OSI as a \"routine intelligence function\". Thus, at the same time that the Air Force was publicly chastising Capt. Rickenbacker for asserting that \"there must be something to them,\" Col. Doyle Rees, the Commander of the 24th OSI district, was compiling a \"Summary of Observations of Aerial Phenomena in the New Mexico Area\" 67 in which he included reports by observers \"whose reliability is not questioned.\" Many of these reports involved \"flying discs.\" Col. Rees also referred to the setting up of a research program involving the Land-Air Corp. This was part of \"Project Twinkle\" which, according to an FBI memorandum 66 , was set up \"for the purpose of photographing and determining the speed, height and nature of the unusual phenomena referred to as green fireballs and discs.\" (Emphasis by present author.) Pity the poor Air Force; \"unconventional aircraft\" would not go away. Therefore General Cabell issued a document requesting information on such aircraft from all the major intelligence agencies of the U.S. Government. He also requested that \"no publicity be given this reporting or analysis activity\" 69 . Does this sound like a cover-up? Pity the poor Air Force. It was a house divided within itself. One portion of the Air Force (public relations) was trying hard to convince (\"brainwash'?) the public and the other portions of the Air force that \"flying saucers\" didn't exist. Another portion (OSI) was handling day-to-day UFO reports and indicating that there was definitely cause for concern, especially with regard to the incidents in the southwest. This portion of the OSI had more than enough UFO reports to keep it busy. Yet another portion of the Air Force (the top men in the OSI, as compared with the lower level OSI that was handling the green fireball/disc reports from the southwest) was sending requests to government intelligence agencies for more information. From the point of view of the other investigative agencies the Air Force approach to UFOs (flying discs) may have appeared as either an uncoordinated research effort or else as a deliberate attempt to cover up something (otherwise, why state publicly that flying saucers don't exist and imply that the Air Force is not interested in such reports, while stating privately — to other covert intelligence agencies — that the Air Force is in need of all the information it can get on \"unconventional aircraft\".) We all know (continued on next page) 13"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"(FBI Files, Continued) that the \"house divided cannot stand.\" (The Air Force investigation of UFOs finally \"crashed\" in 1969, after a long and \"checkered\" history. The public appearance of the Air Force UFO investigation versus the \"private\" appearance was probably what caused Hoover to write his March 1950 memo asking for the Air Force opinion on flying saucers. A diligent reader of Ruppelt's book will notice that soon after the Grudge report was made public (following Keyhoe's widely-read article in True magazine) late in December 1949, Project Grudge was \"junked\" 74 . This explains the answer that Hoover got from the Air Force (\"The Air Force discountinued their intelligence project \") K . However, as Ruppelt points out, the top men in Air Force Intelligence did not request the end of Project Grudge; it was the lower echelon OSI officers who decided to stop the activities of Project Grudge since \"most UFO reports were trash,\" according to the Grudge Report. When the top AF intelligence officers inquired about the status of Project Grudge they were told that UFO investigative activity was now carried out in normal intelligence channels (i.e., by the OSI) along with other intelligence reports 74 . Air Force Project Reinstituted. Apparently the green fireball/disc situation in the midwest combined with the continuance of good UFO reports from reliable individuals despite a lack of public Air Force interest 75 forced the lower echelons of the Air Force intelligence into rethinking their, positions on the need for UFO investigations, because by October 1950 the special project for the investigation of flying saucers had been \"reinstituted at Wright Field\" 71 . Moreover, the need for continued reporting of UFO incidents had been expressed in September by General Cabell in his document (previously discussed) entitled \"Reporting of Unconventional Aircraft\" 69 . Thus, when Ruppelt arrived at ATIC (Air Technical Intelligence Center) in January 1951, there was a UFO project, although it didn't involve many people. Moreover, the attitude toward UFO reports was generally one of amused tolerance rather than scientific interest. According to Ruppelt the reason for the 14 highly skeptical attitude toward flying saucers was that \"the powers-that-be are anti-flying saucer, and to stay in favor it behooves one to follow suit.\" 76 By comparing the information in the FBI file with that given by Ruppelt I have gained the impression that the \"powers-that-be\" weren't exactly anti- flying saucer because they repeatedly asked for more information. However, the public impression of flying saucer reports that resulted from the negative conclusions of the Sign and Grudge reports made it seem that the \"official\" Air Force attitude, i.e., the attitude of the top generals, etc. (the so-called \"powers-that-be\") was that there was nothing to UFO reports. This public impression also affected the lower echelon of the Air Force intelligence. Therefore, the lower echelon assumed that the \"powers-that-be\" didn't believe in flying saucers and that therefore they (the lower echelon) had better explain all UFO reports. Naturally, the more UFO reports that were \"explained,\" the more it appeared that there was nothing to UFO reports. This self- reinforcing cycle caused the interest in UFO reports to drop to virtually zero, which was the level of interest when Ruppelt arrived at ATIC. UFO Reports for 1950. I have already presented the Kodiak, Alaska radar-visual report and others from Kodiak. These are probably the most interesting of 1950, but there are some others worthy of mention. In June 1950, a Washington, D.C., man reported seeing a silvery object resembling a tilted cigar over Washington at 9:25 AM on the 25th of the month 77 . On the 29th of June, FBI personnel and citizens of Pheonix, Arizona, reported seeing an object at 5:45 PM that was high in the sky. It was picked up on radar, and a plane traveling at 290 m.p.h. was able to circle under the object, which appeared to be at an altitude of about 35,000 ft. From the description, the object may have been a balloon, although it was described as travelling westward in .the absence of wind. It travelled at an estimated average speed of about 50 m.p.h. 78 . On July 18 the Special Agent in Charge (SAC) for Chicago reported that a Chicago man had seen a cigar- shaped object travelling rapidly from the northwest to the southeast at 1:00 AM on the morning of July 1. The informant, who was in a watchman's tower in North Chicago, said that \"the object did not appear like any falling star or meteor he had evem seen.\" The \"front two-thirds of the object had a constant glow about the color of a burning kerosene lamp, and the rear third was dark. . . . The object left a bluish-white trail which was three times the length of the object.... there was no sound discernible.\" The informant knew of no other witnesses. 79 At 9:54 PM, July 4,1950, the SAC for Chicago received a phone call from a meteorologist who worked with United Air Lines. The meteorologist said that about 16 minutes earlier he had seen a large, bright silvery object moving in a north, northwesterly directly at an approximate altitude of 10,000 feet and an approximate speed (if at that altitude) of 700 to 800 m.p.h. The meteorologist advised the Special Agent that the \"object he observed was not a plane nor was it a fireworks display.\"* 1 About the first of September the FBI received a letter from a \"gentleman farmer\" near Toronto, Ontario. The farmer reported that he and his \"houseman\" watched a strange \"hazy object of light\" through thin clouds from about 10:30 to 11:05 PM on July 19, 1950. The object circled in opposite directions at various times after a rapid approach toward his farm. At about 11:05 PM it disappeared in a westerly direction. The farmer closed his letter as follows: \"I am passing this along to you for what it is worth. If you are not interested throw it in the waste paper basket.\" There is no indication that the FBI was interested in this case, but it was not thrown in the wastebasket. 81 In late September the FBI office in Philadelphia reported an incicent which took place on September 26 and which involved police officers. The report read as follows: \"... yesterday evening while two officers of the Philadelphia Police Department were cruising in their scout car they saw through the windshield an object descending slowly to the earth which appeared at first glance to be a parachute. When the officers first noticed the object, it was at tree-top level and was described as"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"being six feet in diameter. It landed in a field nearby and the officers, upon examining it, noted that it gave out a purplish glow which was almost a mist. The officers summoned two other police officers. After looking at the object for some time they attempted to pick it up. The object broke, leaving a slight odorless residue. Over a period of about 25 minutes which the officers spent watching the object it completely disintegrated. The officers further commented that the object was so light that when it hit the field, it did not even bend the weeds or the grass it fell on.\" The FBI letter says that the local OSI office was notified. 82 . On October 13 the FBI received a teletype message from Knoxville, Tennessee, which reported the radar detection of eleven or more objects at. 11:25 PM on October 12. The objects appeared to be travelling across a controlled area of the atomic energy installation at Oak Ridge. The altitudes varied from 1,000 to 5,000 feet, and the densities of the targets were comparable to those made by \"light aircraft to aircraft equal in size to C-47. The apparent speeds were about 100- 125 m.p.h. A fighter plane attempted an intercept but could not detect anything visually or on its radar. 83 A letter reporting an interview with a man who worked for the Chemical and Physical Laboratories of the Winchester Repeating Arms Co. of New Haven, Connecticut, was received by the FBI headquarters in November. The man advised that on October 20 at about 6:15 PM he and his wife and daughter, while in the back yard of their home, saw a golden-orange sphere-like object in the sky directly overhead. The glow given off by the object was steady and the whole sphere glowed with about equal brightness. The object was seen for about 20 seconds while it travelled toward New York City and then changed direction. He lost sight of it when it got so low on the horizon that trees blocked his view. He said the object was about \"ten times the diameter of Venus, which was shining very brightly that night/'The witness further stated that \". . . it was a very clear night and that all the stars in the sky were twinkling as compared to the steadiness of the glow given off by this object.\" He detected no sound. This report was turned over to the OSI. 84 In December the FBI was informed of one visual and two radar sightings of unknown objects over Oak Ridge, Tennessee. The Army attachment protecting Oak Ridge reported contacts for about three hours starting at 4:05 PM on December 14. According to the Army report, which was in the FBI file, \"A group of targets blanketed the radar scopes in the area directly over the government Atomic Energy Commission projects at Oak Ridge, Tennessee. These objects could not be identified from radar image and a perfect fighter interception met with negative results.\" Photographs of the radar screen were made. On December 18th the Army fowarded another report to the FBI. This one concerned a visual sighting by eight witnesses who worked on the Nuclear Energy for Propulsion of Aircraft project (Project NEPA) then at Oak Ridge. The sighting was made from two vehicles travelling to work at about 8:30 AM. Signed statements from the witnesses were obtained by the FBI Special Agent at Knoxville. The Army summary stated: \"A light ... in the shape of a circle, of an intensity much greater than that of a bright moon, giving the impression of form in connection with the light (was seen). The light was white in appearance and did not show any signs of refraction into a band or continuous spectrum. This object was travelling in a northwesterly direction, 15 to 30 degrees elevation above the horizon, and appeared to diminish considerably in size during the 30 seconds of observation (by one of the groups of men). To another group the object appeared only as a bright reflection of the sun from an apparently metal surface. No accurate estimate of the object's size or range could be made from the observation.\" The radar log of the McGhee Tyson Air Force Radar Station which was nearby showed a contact at 8:39 AM lasting until 8:45 AM. \"A fighter interception was attempted with negative results.\" 85 , 86 The third radar contact occurred on December 20 at 12:47 PM. The Army report states, \"small paint in area (Oak Ridge Controlled Area). Very, very slow. Made perfect intercept (with F-82 Fighter aircraft) and orbit surrounding small smoke cloud.\" Assuming the radar set was sufficiently sensitive to detect a cloud of smoke, then it would appear that this UFO was merely the exhaust from some furnace or engine. On the other hand, perhaps there was a solid UFO which vanished between radar sweeps leaving a cloud of smoke (e.g., Heflin case, Aug. 1965.) 8 ' On the fifth of December, Hoover himself took an interest in radar signals picked up at Oak Ridge. In a teletype to the SAC at Knoxville, Tennessee, Hoover wrote, \"Arrangements should be made to obtain all facts concerning possible radar jamming by ionization of particles in atmosphere. Conduct appropriate investigation to determine whether incident occurring northeast of Oliver Springs, Tennessee, could have had any connection with alleged radar jamming.\" There is no reference to an \"incident occurring northeast of Oliver Springs\" in the selection of FBI papers which I now have, so I don't know what this teletype refers to. 88 The final item of interest for 1950 is a teletype message from the SAC at Richmond, Virginia. It reads as follows: \"This office (has been) very confidentially advised by Army intelligence, Richmond, that they have been put on immediate high alert for any data whatsoever concerning flying saucers. CIC (Counter Intelligence Corps) here states background of instructions not available from Air Force Intelligence, who are not aware of reason for alert locally, but any information whatsoever must be telephoned by them immediately to Air Force intelligence. CIC advises data strictly confidential and should not be disseminated.\" 89 I do not know the reason for this \"high alert,\" but further investigation may uncover the reason. Thus ends the UFO history of 1950, as far as the FBI is concerned. The information contained in the FBI file shows that the Air Force interest in UFO reports was picking up again in 1950 despite attempts to downplay the importance of such reports. This increased interest, caused mainly by the improvement in quality of the reports, ultimately resulted in the complete revitalization of Project Grudge in late 1951 under Ruppelt.

Samuel S. Torrey, Jr., 32, a welder, Judy Willinski, and Michael Koczwara were gathered in the Torrey's back yard watching the children play baseball about 8:00 PM. \"As Mr. Torrey lifted his head to follow the flight of a batted ball, he noticed through a gap in the tall pines. . .what looked like a balloon in the distance. As he continued to look the object moved rapidly closer until, in a matter of seconds, it had reached a point that the witness estimated as 200-300 feet from them at an elevation of 15°: Mrs. Willinski had now also noticed the object as it hovered, bobbed and wobbled for about 5 seconds before beginning to move slowly to the observers' left and being lost to view behind the nearest pines. ...\" The three walked quickly to the front of the house to fry to continue the observation, where Michael Koczwara now also saw the object through a gap in the pines. \"Koczwara and Torrey saw the object hover and wobble again for a few seconds before it receded into the distance and was lost to sight below the tree line.\" The total time of appearance of the object was estimated to be about 1 minute. Phone calls to the police and the airport turned up no explanation for the sighting. \"The bobbing at the points of the object's hover were described by Mrs. Willinski as similar to a 'ball on water.' Mr. Torrey noticed wobbling around two axes; that is, he saw both pitch and 16 roll but not apparently at the same time. It was when the object first tilted around its pitch axis at the initial point of observation that Mr. Torrey observed a dome. He also noticed pitch and roll at the second observation point.\" The color was described as silvery-gray, or \"like pewter\" (Mrs. Willinski). After witness interviews and character checks, as well as checks with local authorities for possible explanations, the investigators concluded that the identity of the object was \"unknown\". JMarkR.

In September 1978 a new book, important to ufology, was published by Hwong Publishing Company. Its title is The Etherean Invasion and its author is John de Herrera, widely known in Southern California and elsewhere for his careful, open-minded research of the UFO phenomenon. John is an APRO investigator, but he moves freely among the ranks of other organizations' investigators, sharing information generously and cooperating wholeheartedly in joint research projects. One of the tragedies of UFO research at present is its tendency to sectionalize studies — to differentiate between \"MUFON cases,\" \"APRO cases,\" \"CUFOS cases,\" etc. Our human tools of detection and perception are too limited to permit us to fully understand the UFO problem. Cooperation between organizations and individuals must be the key, with open communication whenever possible. John's book sprang from such cooperation between researchers of differing organizational ties. It tells the full fascinating, and sometimes frightening, story of UFO abductee Brian Scott. It is the first book, to my knowledge, to give full details of the transformation of a human being from obscure witness to evangelistic contactee. The Etherean Invasion is especially remarkable in two ways: 1. It is essentially a researcher's manuscript, combining narrative, documented description, and tape transcripts of the case as it unfolded from beginning to end. There is <no sensationalism in de Herrera's writing. He maintains for the most part the style of an investigator's report. The fantastic nature of the case itself, however, comes through John's objective style, making the book absorbing reading. I know from close association with persons concerned with the investigation that every word is true, even the parts which seem incredible. 2. It is a carefully documented account of the metamorphosis of an ordinary, suspected abductee into a full-blown ultramontane prophet, complete with a direct link between Brian Scott himself and the \"extraterrestrial entity\" which imparts direction to Brian's followers. The Scott case was first investigated by Dr. Alvin Lawson, Dr. W. C. McCall, and Idabel Epperson on behalf of MUFON, with Al Lawson as the primary investigator. Hypnotic regression sessions unfolded a full- fledged abduction experience. Each successive session uncovered more fantastic detail. The case took a frightening turn when poltergeist activity broke out in the Scott home. These manifestations seemed associated with the entities Scott had met aboard the UFO, and indeed the chief entity, known as \"The Host,\" was himself a frequent visitor in the home! At this point, when \"balls of fire\" were seen by different witnesses floating around and inside the Scott residence, Brian began falling into spontaneous trances, allowing the voice of \"The Host\" — and other alien voices — to be transmitted through him. Concurrent with these phenomena, Scott was caught in the act of perpetrating an apparent hoax, and Lawson and McCall, understand- ably, dropped the case. DeHerrera, however, had been interested in the case from the beginning. He continued on with it, taking over as primary investigator. Having had prior experience with \"ball of fire\" manifestations, he was not discouraged by the bizarre turn the Scott case had taken. Within him, he had an instinctive curiosity that spurred him on. Human minds are limited. They cannot, unlike the \"universal geniuses\" of centuries past, comprehend all sciences and all knowledge. Consequently, we have specialists in physical sciences, in psychology, in parapsychology, for instance. Trained scientific minds, however, tend to ignore or scorn what they have not learned. Therefore, our paradox in the Brian Scott case. A trained parapsychologist can see implications of paranormal aspects in UFO cases and tends to ignore a physicist's theory that UFOs are nuts and bolts craft, and so on down the line. But in rare cases, such as de Herrera's, a researcher can extend his knowledge beyond his specialty and apply this new knowledge toward a greater understanding of the UFO phenomenon. When this happens, it generally can be explained thus; that the researcher in his own life has encountered some weird experience, entirely alien to him but which has intrigued him and captured his imagination. John de Herrera from childhood was interested in the \"ball of light\" phenomenon, for among his own relatives were persons who had witnessed these objects. In his book is information about the phenomenon gleaned from many sources. De Herrera has attempted to show correlations between other cases worldwide and Brian Scott's \"balls of light.\" He also attempts explanations for the phenomenon and presents the surprising hypothesis that \"balls of fire\" (continued on next page) 17"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"UFO TECH NOTE IDENTIFICATION OF CRASH SITES By John F. Schuessler On June 30, 1908, at approxi- mately 7 AM, a cataclysmic explosion scarred a vast area of the Tungus taiga in Siberia. Although arguments continue to the present as to whether the explosion was caused by a UFO, black hole, meteor, or some crazy nuclear explosion, the date and time, as well as the location of the incident is well established. Eyewitness testimony is accepted at least for that much. Sometimes, however, the evidence contains missing parts and the situation is less clear. For example, Bob Pratt of the National Enquirer investigated the report of a UFO over Bolivia and northern Argentina. The object was observed by hundreds at 4:15 PM, on May 6,1978, as it traversed a south by southeasterly course, finally turning southwest over Tarija towards the mountains in the border area. An explosion was heard and the object seemed to crash in that remote mountainous part of the country. After an : extensive period of on-the-spot investigation, Mr. Pratt concluded that if a crash site existed it would probably be on the side of Bravo Mountain, a 5- hour horseback ride west of Mecoya. He searched the area from the air arid from the ground and found a huge rockslide, possible evidence of a crash. Even though the rockslide was the only one anywhere throughout those rugged mountains, and was in the approximate line of flight of the cylindrical UFO, it could not be proven that the slide actually occurred on the day of the UFO sighting. More evidence was needed. It is not often that large geographic disturbances appear to coincide with UFO sightings, but when it does happen a space-age tool is now available to the investigator. The Landsat satellite program, supple- mented by Skylab and NASA aircraft data, provides fairly good geographic 18 coverage of the globe. The data is available to anyone willing to pay a nominal fee. The third Landsat was launched into near-polar orbit on March 5,1978, and now orbits bur globe at 570 miles high every 103 minutes. This type of orbit allows surface coverage of the Earth to proceed westward, with a slight overlap, so that the globe will be covered once every 18 days. This permits a systematic study of the Earth's resources and environment. The Landsat is used for remotely sensing features on the Earth's surface, a potential tool for determining whether or not a particular UFO caused a crash site. The Landsat carries two sensor subsystems to view the Earth directly beneath the spacecraft. The systems are the return beam vidicon (RBV) and the multispectral scanner. Details may be found in the August 1978 issue of the Journal of the British Interplanetary Society. It is doubtful that a Landsat pass over a given site would coincide exactly with the UFO sighting time because of the 18 days required by the satellite to cover the globe. However, a set of data may be available that is near the correct date. For instance, if Landsat photos taken days or even weeks to months before May 6, 1978, indicated a large area of rock landslide at the alleged crash site, it would be fairly obvious that the UFO was not the cause. On the other hand, if no rockslide is evident then the two anomalies may really coincide. Further, if the Landsat data were available for the date of the sighting or very soon thereafter, the thermal band sensors could clearly indicate a \"hot\" spot, suggesting that it might be worth digging into the rockslide for a closer look. The process for ordering Landsat photographs is fairly simple. One must (California Report, Continued) are intradimensional .entities themselves! There is some evidence that these entities can change form and shape at will. The book is an intriguing account of the terrifying milieu which can emerge from a seemingly harmless abduction experience. Even to one familiar with the tapes and transcripts of the Scott hypnotic sessions, it is absorbing reading. For those researchers and other interested persons who are not familiar with the Brian Scott case, prepare yourselves for a journey into the Twilight Zone. The book, for all its intelligent preparation, is flawed, however, as de Herrera is the first to admit. His manuscript was rushed into publication over his protests that it needed editing or, indeed, rewriting. He considered his manuscript as a first draft, but the publishers were so excited by the totally new aspect it threw onto the subject of UFOs that they went ahead and typeset it over John's objections. The publishers, to their credit, however, u;ere aware of the popular interest the book will probably create. It is easy to overlook the flaws, however, for they are mere imperfections in construction and not in content. The entire story of Brian Scott is there, together with a great amount of peripheral research related to various psychic aspects of the UFO phenomenon, as displayed in this bizarre case. In summation, read The Etherean Invasion, available at selected bookstores or from the Hwong Publishing Company, 10353 Los Alamitos Blvd., Los Alamitos, California 90720, priced at $2.95.

The January issue of FATE has an article by David Stupple on the highly controversial claims of the late contactee, George Adamski.

After changing editors of the MUFON UFO Journal three times in the past three years, and typesetters an equal number of times, logistical problems have created delays in the publication whereby the month and year on the cover does not reflect the current information contained within its pages. We receive numerous inquiries asking why we are apparently late. Now the people are questioning how we can report in the August 1978 issue (number 129) the Frederick Valentich pilot/aircraft disappearance-in Australia that actually occurred on October 21,1978. It is imperative that a publication of the caliber of the MUFON UFO Journal should be current and make it unnecessary for our staff to apologize for the cover date. Starting with this issue, you will note that it contains the combined monthly identification of November- December 1978, issue number 132. The following issue, number 133, will be designated January-February 1979. We will then resume our monthly edition with March 1979 issue number 134. when we will be current. Other monthly UFO publications have faced the same problem, therefore it is not unique to MUFON. With 20 pages, the Journal is the largest monthly UFO publication in the world. Others vary from 4 to 12. Some people have suggested that we simply skip several issues, which would automatically bring the issues up-to- date. We believe our plan will be received favorably. The plan described here will guarantee that each member and subscriber will receive twelve (12) issue numbers even though two will be combined issues: (1) The subscriber's expiration date now appearing on the Journal cover as part of your address, would be effectively extended two additional months. (2) This would be controlled by the MUFON office by inserting the \"blue renewal application\" in each copy 2 months after the normal expiration date printed on the cover. (3) Presently, we are sending renewal reminders in the last issue of the subscription. In order to encourage people to renew their membership/ subscription, two additional monthly copies are mailed with renewal notices before their address stencils are removed from our file. This policy is especially important for our foreign subscribers due to the slow handling of second class mail. Continuity is thus maintained in their copies even though it may take over a month for them to receive their issue and then renew. (4) By using consecutive issue numbers, subscribers will recognize the continuity of their copies even though we have combined two monthly issues. This is also very important to high school, college, and university libraries that purchase their subscriptions through book and periodical agencies. We could thus explain this plan, if requested, to their satisfaction. We are confident that this method of becoming current will meet the approval of our members and subscribers. May we thank all of you for being so patient in this regard during the past two years. On the humorous side, someone will probably jibe our editor on the fact that issue number 130 was dated \"September 1979\" in error by our typesetter. Seriously, this was not a method of becoming current or predating our publication as some magazines make a practice of doing. Our Continental Coordinator expansion program has now included Australia/New Zealand with the appointment of Keith Basterfield, 3 Park Lake Drive, Wynn Vale, South Australia 5127 as coordinator by Michael Sinclair, International Coordinator. Keith has been one of MUFON's Australian Representatives „ for the past two years and was designated as our official information center for Australia by Richard Hall, formerly our International Co- ordinator. Keith has been one of the Journal's most consistent contributors of published articles for UFO events in Australia. Bill Chalker and Keith supplied the lead story about the missing pilot for the August 1978 issue. The New Zealand visual, radar, photographic sightings occurring near the year's end by pilots and film crews was reported by Keith. Harold Fulton, MUFON Director for New Zealand, supplied an immense number of newspaper clippings from the New Zealand press on the same events and has been an effective MUFON spokesman on the scene. As Continental Coordinator, Mr. Basterfield will not only be our major communication source, but he will be working with Mr. Fulton and the state directors of Australia.
