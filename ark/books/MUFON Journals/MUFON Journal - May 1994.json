Investigation by MUFON Ontario E ditor's note: What follows is sure to be contro- versial. Certainly, the picture it paints is not always a pretty one. Unfortunately, there is much about contemporary \"ufology\" that is not pretty, hoaxes, disinformation and shoddy investigative tech- niques, among others, included. However, hiding our collective heads in the sand is unlikely to make the picture any prettier. It is not our intention to embarrass or castigate any particular group or individual, merely to clear the air, and, as best as possible in these confused times, set the record straight about the so-called Carp Case, let- ting the chips fall where they may. Any mentioned individuals is free to respond at reasonable length. The following investigation first appeared in the premiere issue of the MUFON Ontario Newsletter. Subscriptions, six issues a year, are available for $20 U.S. from MUFON Ontario, 3058 Fifth Line W. #7, Mississauga, Ontario, L5L 5W4, Canada. The primary author is MUFON member Errol Bruce Knapp, working under guidelines established by Tom Theophanus, MUFON's Provincial Assistant Director for Ontario. Mr. Theophanus was an investi- gator with the Canadian UFO Research Network. CUFORN, Toronto, from 1987 to 1992. He and his wife, Lise, have been with MUFON Ontario since then. THE MUFON ONTARIO VERSION This case has had much coverage in the media. Tabloid television shows like \"Unsolved Mysteries,\" \"Sightings\" and \"Encounters\" have given it much air-time, as have cable-TV stations all over North America. Internationally, magazines, newspapers and news- letters have devoted hundreds of pages to it and UFO conferences around the planet have intrigued many thousands of attendees with its seemingly startling de- tails. \"Carp,\" or the Guardian Caper, has achieved status as \"One of the Most Significant Cases in UFO History.\" You've probably heard, seen and read about it your- self. In this and succeeding issues we'll deal with the FACTS of the case. We'll describe the events, as told by the media and as we've experienced them—and we'll try not to appear too judgmental. BEGINNINGS—1989 Tom Theofanous, working with The Canadian UFO Research Network (CUFORN), received a package from someone calling themselves \"Guardian.\" It had no return address. \"The package contained a story about a UFO crash that supposedly happened close to Carlton Place, which is about a half-hour drive from Ottawa,\" Tom said. \"There was also a photo-copied picture of an Alien. \"For the most part, we thought it was a joke. But, CUFORN director Harry Tokarz decided to call Arthur Bray, a well-respected UFO author and researcher who lives in Ottawa, and ask him if he had someone in the Carlton area who could check out the story for us. As luck would have it, Arthur knew a fel- low who was fascinated by the field of ufology, Graham Lightfoot.\" Graham, with what was to become typical thor- oughness, used the somewhat sketchy co-ordinates he got from Arthur Bray to not only pinpoint the \"UFO crash-site\" near Manion Corners, but also locate a number of witnesses. One of those witnesses, Diane Labanek, claimed that on the night of November 4th, 1989, she saw an intense, bright light pass overhead, heading towards a swamp at the far end of the field behind and south of her home. She said she also saw several helicopters earlier that evening using bright lights to scan the area. Another West Carlton resident recalled that that was the weekend when some cattle escaped from a nearby pasture and that it took till late Sunday to round them up. A couple told Graham about the wife being scared by a very bright light shone through their south-facing bathroom window. \"It reached right down our hall- way!\" The wife also mentioned that she vaguely remembered hearing the sound of helicopters at the time. Others talked of \"dogs and cattle being disturbed.\" Many people could think of absolutely nothing unusual happening during the course of the weekend, including a couple who had a telescope set-up. Graham reported those findings to Arthur Bray, along with results of his examination of the field and swamp behind Labanek's home—there were no signs on the ground, anywhere, of the heavy equipment that would be needed to recover a \"crashed craft.\" His report closed with \"although I could find noth- ing conclusive to support or disprove any of the wit- nesses' claims, I shall check back around the area later this summer.\" MAY 1994 NUMBER 313 PAGE 3"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL Robert Oeclislertriglit) video la/tint; Graham Litflnfuot ui Cm p. Ontario, an May 10, 1992. The same Guardian material had been sent to sever- al other investigators, researchers and UFO groups and as the story spread, both the former Provincial Director of MUFON Ontario Clive Nadin. and the current Quebec Director Christian Page, visited the area on separate occasions, and spoke to the \"witness- es.\" They confirmed Graham Lightfoot's initial find- ings and agreed with Tom & Harry at CUFORN that someone was \"trying to put us on—a hoax!\" GUARDIAN RE-SURFACES— 1991 In the middle of October, 1991 CUFORN began receiving more Guardian \"information\" via the mail and all postmarked \"Ottawa.\" An envelope with some documents that mention a \"conspiracy\" between the Chinese and \"Gray Aliens that are planning to take over the world,\" arrived first. Then came a Polaroid photograph of a \"UFO\" flying across an unidentified road. A while later came a black & white picture of a gray-type \"Alien.\" The fourth delivery in the series was a package. It contained the now infamous VHS video tape with a green label on the cassette, with a thumb print and the word GUARDIAN printed on the label. There were also three playing cards in the package, all with hand- written notes on them—an Ace, King and Joker. A photo-copied map showed the \"Gray's landing area,\" along with notes explaining that the flares in the video were used to help the UFO. which can out- maneuver anything on the planet, fly under the radar and know where to land! There were also \"Canadian Department of National Defense documents\" enclosed—which, upon later investigation, proved to be forgeries. These \"docu- ments,\" it is thought, were designed to look like the official documents on UFOs that Canadian UFO author/researcher Stanton Friedman acquired, via The Freedom of Information Act, from the United States Government. The video—a few minutes long—showed two dif- ferent angles of what Guardian alleges was an 'alien craft' on the ground. (See cover.) First, a long shot of bright lights clumped together to the right of the scene and what looked like four red emergency road flares or fires in barrels on the left side of the screen. The second scene showed the same clump of bright lights from approximately the same distance but more to the center without any flares and the sound of a single dog barking in the distance. The third scene was only three frames long and was a close-up of a pair of windshield wipers half-way across a very Earth-bound vehicle! CUFORN pondered what to do with all the Guardian information that arrived in October of '91 and decided, that in view of the season—winter—they would hold off visiting Carlton until after the spring run-off. ENTER OESCHLER At the beginning of March '92, Bob Oeschler (pro- nounced Ex-ler) an American MUFON investigator— who describes himself as a \"former NASA mission PAGE 4 NUMBER 313 MAY 1994"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL specialist\"—called CUFORN from his home in Maryland. Apparently, he too had received a video and docu- ments from Guardian, although when comparisons of the two videos were discussed, his had an additional scene—a somewhat closer one minute shot of the \"alien craft.\" His version also had a couple of minutes worth of the windshield, plus several still shots of the \"Gray Aliens\". The most important difference, however, was that his version of the tape had no audio-track at all— \"it seems it was intentionally removed,\" says Tom Theofanous. Oeschler had shown the tape to Bruce Maccabee and they agreed that what they saw was a UFO and should be investigated further—and that's why Oeschler called Tom at CUFORN. They agreed they would meet in Carlton, Ontario on May 10th 1992. Tom then called and spoke with Graham Lightfoot. for the first time, and Graham agreed to act as guide for the May meeting. It transpired that Graham worked for The O.F.A—The Ontario Federation of Agriculture—and knew the Carlton area and its farm- ers well. THE FIRST VISIT On May 10th, Mother's Day, 1992, Torontonians Tom & Lise Theofanous, Victor Lourenco, Vaughn Killin, Drew Williamson, Harry Tokarz and Wayne St. John met with Oeschler, his son and Graham Lightfoot at the motel the Oeschlers were staying at in West Carlton, near Ottawa. Ontario. They all had breakfast together as Oeschler told many, many fascinating stories. Eventually they ended up in Oeschler's motel room to compare their copies of the Guardian video. \"Oeschler, despite being an expert in video analysis, had a great deal of difficulty connecting my video cam- era up to the TV set in his room so that we could play back the Guardian videos. In retrospect, his combination of technical ineptness and more story telling seemed to be a stalling tactic,\" said Tom. Eventually, the group set off in a convoy of vehicles to examine the area depicted in Guardian's map. They stopped at a spot off Highway 7 near Manion Corners and Graham pointed out the direction from which the 1989 \"UFO\" had come when it \"crashed,\" and where the Labenek's house was in relation to where the group was standing. Oeschler seemed to be stalling once more, shooting video of everything. Finally, they set off again. \"This time Oeschler took the lead, with me follow- ing him and Graham, who's supposed to be our guide, following me!\" Tom says. \"I thought at the time that this was pretty odd. How did Oeschler, who supposed- ly had never been to Canada, let alone this area before, knew his way, using side roads and making the correct turns toward our destination?\" Earlier, Oeschler had asked the Toronto group to check for anomalies on their compasses while they were driving, because the Guardian papers described magnetic changes in certain parts of the area the group was traveling in. \"So. we're driving down a small hill when Oeschler braked suddenly up ahead of us, stopped and came back to our car to tell me that he had found an anom- aly on his two compasses,\" Tom recounts. \"Now, he had both of his laying in the back of his pick-up on the metal floor where they were bouncing around. His son was keeping an eye on them from the cab. \"I told him that the three compasses, which we were holding in the palms of our hands, in our car didn't waver at all. But, he insisted that he'd go back up the hill, by himself, and check again.\" While the rest of the group stood around waiting for Oeschler. Drew Williamson noticed a Stop-sign at the end of a long driveway leading to an abandoned farmhouse with a For-Sale sign on it. Tom continues: \"1 looked through my binoculars at the Stop-sign and saw that it was propped up by rocks. There were other signs around it that read 'Do Not Enter' and 'DND Killing Fields'. The last one had pictographs of tanks, helicopters and weapons on it and appeared to be riddled with bullet-holes.

We found tracks left by cars and what might have been four-wheeled vehicles, leading into the property. We felt that perhaps the field around the old farm house was being used for 'War Games'—or maybe even was the location used for the Guardian video. \"Why? Because the terrain was perfect—lots (200 acres) of open field. I also noticed a dog barking up at the house at the top of the hill.\" said Tom. This would become significant later in identifying the possible location of the Guardian video shoot. \"Eventually, we continued along Corkery Road. But, when I mentioned to Oeschler that we should be interviewing the people in the neighborhood we were passing, who were out sitting in their front gardens or working on their lawns, he insisted that we look for the 'crash' or 'landing' sites.\" Guardian's map described an area about one and a quarter miles square, which consisted of dense, knee- high scrub and wet swampland. The group headed toward it, using a path beneath high-tension power transmission lines that cut across below the southern end of the Labenek's property. Most of them had great difficulty with the rough conditions and became very tired, annoyed by biting mosquitoes and soaked by the swampy ground. They gave up about halfway into the swamp and headed back to the parking lot. T om picks up the story again: \"Bob and his son continued to look for the landing site as the rest of us left the swamp in a couple of different groups. Use, Drew, Wayne and I left first and drove off looking for a drink of cold pop. \"When we got back to the parking lot twenty min- utes later, the second group out had left a note on our windshield saying they'd meet us at a restaurant twen- ty minutes away in Carp. We left a note on the Oeschlers' truck windshield telling them where we'd be. \"The first of our group to arrive at the restaurant ordered their food and twenty minutes later the rest of us arrived and placed our orders. \"Thirty minutes later, as Oeschler and his son were walking through the door, I jokingly said: I bet he'll say he found the spot! \"As he sat down, I asked him what had happened. He smiled and said he'd found the spot. \"I asked how he'd managed to do that when we'd left him at about a mile from his car in a dense swamp PAGE 6 NUMBER 313 MAY 1994"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL halfway to the alleged site and it was getting dark. There simply hadn't been enough time to get there, examine the 'site' and get back out to his truck and drive to the restaurant. He just smiled, but didn't answer.\" After they finished their dinner, Drew, Victor and Vaughn decided to leave for Toronto. Graham suggested that the remainder should go talk to the Labeneks, and he and Harry left ahead of Tom & Lise and the Oeschlers, since Oeschler senior was still eating. The seven of them would meet at the corner by the Labeneks. \"Lise. Wayne and 1 confronted Oeschler out in the parking lot, where the three of us had gone to discuss the day's events privately. \"1 asked him what he was trying to pull here. He responded by asking 'what's wrong with trying to make a buck?' I answered that there was nothing wrong with making money as long as we didn't com- promise our ethics. \"Oeschler came back with: 'No matter what or how good the story is, 50% of the people will believe you, 50% won't. All you have to care about is the 50% that will.' \"It was at that point,\" recalls Tom, \"that I decided to back away from the investigation for a while to see what Oeschler would do.\" They joined the others at Manions Corner by the Labeneks house—Graham had knocked on their door but there was no one home. So, they waited, enjoying a pleasant early summer evening, talking. The Labeneks didn't get home till after 10 p.m., which the group felt was late to do an interview. Graham and Oeschler would come back in the morn- ing and talk to them. Tom finishes up this part of the story: \"1 told Graham about the conversation that I had in the parking lot of the restaurant with Oeschler, after he left the restaurant. Then Lise, Harry, Wayne and 1 left for Toronto, shaking our heads.\" To be continued.

THE ALLEGED CRASH/RETRIEVAL OF THE 11/89 \"ALIEN STARFIGHTER\" Canadian and American Security Agencies are engaged in a conspiracy of silence, to withhold from the world the alien vessel seized in the swamps of Corkery Road, Carp, in 1989. UFO sightings in the Ontario region had intensified in the 1980's, specifically, around nuclear power generat- ing stations. On Nov. 4, 1989 at 20:00 hrs Canadian Defense Dept. radars picked up a globe shaped object traveling at phenomenal speed over Carp, Ontario. The UFO abruptly stopped, and dropped like a stone. Canadian and American Security Agencies were im- mediately notified of the landing. Monitoring satellites traced the movements of the aliens to a triangular area (see aerial map) off Almonte and Corkery Roads. The ship had landed in deep swamp near Corkery Road. Two AH-64 Apaches and a UH-60 Blackhawk headed for the area the following night. The helicopters carried full weapon loads. They were part of a covert American unit that specialized in the recovery of alien craft. Flying low over Ontario pine trees the Apache attack choppers soon spotted a glowing, blue, 20 meter in di- ameter sphere. As targeting lasers locked-on, both gun- ships unleashed their full weapon loads of 8 missiles each. All 16 were exploded in proximity bursts 10 me- ters downwind from the ship. The missiles were carrying VEXXON, a deadly neu- roactive gas which kills on contact. Exposed to air the gas breaks down quickly into inert components. Immediately after having completed their mission the gunships turned around, and headed back across the border. Now the Blackhawk landed, as men exploded from its open doors. In seconds the six man strike team had en- tered the UFO through a 7 meters hatchless. oval portal. No resistance was encountered. At the controls, 3 dead crewman were found. With the ship captured, the US Air Force, Pentagon, and Office of Naval Intelligence were notified. Through the night a special team of technicians had shut-down and disassembled the sphere. Early the next morning Nov. 6, 1989 construction equipment and trucks were brought into the swamp. The UFO parts were transported to a secret facility in Kanata, Ontario. As a cover story the locals were informed that a road was being built through the swamp. No smoke screen was needed for the military activity as Canadian forces regularly train in the Carp region. Officially nothing unusual was reported in the area. MAY 1994 NUMBER 313 PAGE 7"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL Although someone anonymously turned in a 35mm roll of film. It was received by the National Research Council of Canada, in Ottawa. The film contained sev- eral clear shots of an entity holding a light. At this time the photographer is still unidentified. The humanoids were packed in ice and sent to an isola- tion chamber at the Univ. of Ottawa. CIA physiologists performed the autopsies. The reptilian, fetus-headed beings, were listed as CLASS 1 NTE's. (Non Terrestrial Entities) Like others recovered in previous operations, they were muscular, gray-white skinned, humanoids. The ship was partially reassembled at the underground facility in Kanata. Unlike previous recoveries this one is pure military. Built as a \"Starfighter\" it is heavily armed and armored. In design no rivets, bolts, or welds were used in fasten- ing, yet when reconstructed there are no seams. The UFO itself is made up of a matrixed dielectric magne- sium alloy. It is driven by pulsed electromagnetic fields generated by a cold fusion reactor. All offensive capa- bilities utilize independently targeting electronic beam weapons. In the cargo hold were found ordnance racks containing fifty Soviet nuclear warheads. Their pur- pose was revealed by advanced tactical/combat com- puters located in the flight deck. Threatened by recent East-West relations, and the revo- lutionary movements within itself, Red China is prepar- ing for the final ideological war. The aliens have agreed to defend China from the free world's combined military and nuclear forces. At this time China is arming the Middle East with their own nuclear arsenals, in order that they can successfully take on Israel. Unifying the Arabs under one Chinese command was simple, especially with Israel's recent \"iron fist\" attitude toward occupied territories. The Soviet warheads found in the UFO were destined for Syria. CIA operatives in the Middle East have no- ticed huge movements of Chinese \"technicians\" and \"advisors\". China is also supplying the Arabs with bac- teriological agents, Migs, Hind gunships, tanks, and missile launchers. The use of \"Soviet\" instead of \"Chinese\" nukes is part of a disinformation campaign to break up East-West rela- tions after the annihilation of Israel. The Warheads were hijacked from Soviet subs in the Dragon's Triangle. A section of alien controlled Pacific once frequented by Russian subs. After losing some 900 high yield war- heads and 13 vessels, commanders were ordered to steer clear of the area. The most important alien-tech find were the 2 millime- ter, spheroid, brain implants. Surgical inserted through the nasal orifice the individual can be fully monitored and controlled. The CIA and Canadian Govt. have ac- tively supported mind-slave experiments for years. Currently the Univ. of Ottawa is involved in ELF wave mind control programs. A continuation of the CIA psy- chological warfare project known as MKULTRA, started at the Allen Memorial Institute in Montreal. Using ELF signals transmitted at the same wavelength the human brain uses, the researchers could subliminally control the test subject. The alien implants utilize the same principles except that the whole unit is sub-minia- turized and contained in the brain. Fortunately the im- plants can be detected by magnetic resolution scanning technology. All individuals implanted by the aliens are classified as ZOMBIES. The ZOMBIES have been programmed to help over- throw Mankind in the near future. When China finishes with Israel it will invade Europe. At the same time Chinese space-based bacteriological weapons will be launched at the Arctic. The winds will carry the diseases into Russia and North America. In days 100's of mil- lions will be dead, survivors will have to deal with Chinese, aliens, and the ZOMBIES. The aliens want all out war so that human resistance would be minimal, when they invade. They tried this same tactic once before with Nazi Germany. Most of the scientific advances we have today came from German science which was based on alien technology. Had Hitler won the war, the earth would have become a concen- tration camp. In order to depopulate the continents for the aliens. Data aboard the sphere explained why the aliens are so comfortable on our world. They preceded man on the evolutionary scale by millions of years; created with the dinosaurs. Some 675 million years ago an interdi- mensional war destroyed most of their civilization, and forced them to leave the earth. Now they have chosen to reclaim what was once theirs. The alien forces with their Chinese and Arab allies will attack within the next 5 years. Waiting longer than that would make it impossible even for the aliens to reverse the ecological damage inflicted on the Earth by Man.

Volume-wise, some UFOs appear larger inside than out. How can such a thing conceivably be? By Stan Kulikowski II J oel Mesnard (1994), in reporting the few French cases of alien abduction, observes one strange oc- currence near Bray-sur-Seine in 1961 or 1962 (p. 8): \"Michel continued to approach. He slipped under the flat, central part of the object to where he could look through the opening to the interior. The most amaz- ing thing was that the interior of the cylinder was im- mense. Incomparably larger than the cylinder seen from the outside...at least six meters in diameter, which was about four times the diameter of the exterior.\" Mesnard can only marvel at \"what infernal charac- teristic of the universe...at least as far as appearances go [can] contain a larger volume within a smaller vol- ume\"? However, several examples of this \"it's not big outside, but there's so much room inside\" syndrome exist in the UFO literature. And as long as UFO stories include this kind of information, we cannot be too sur- prised that ufology has a bad reputation and that many people dismiss it out of hand. Seemingly, Mesnard wants to treat this observational report as an embarrassment in technical reporting. Fortunately, he is thorough enough to include such re- ports even though he clearly struggles with the infor- mation. Far from being a technical embarrassment, this inside-too-big phenomenon is easy to understand from a mathematical perspective and may tell us something about the physical properties of an alien technology. Of course, it may be a hoax and we can search for the possibilities of social contamination in such reports. But it is not \"an infernal property of the universe.\" Indeed, this is a predictable property which I find of great interest. P erhaps since the time of the semi-mythical Pythagoras and certainly since Plato, we have char- acterized the universe according to geometrical dimen- sions: point, line, plane, and space. There is agreement upon these dimensions since the 5th century BC. As near as I can tell (Boyer and Merzbach, 1991), geometries of higher dimensions did not get started until 1854 when Riemann at the University of Gottingen formulated the \"hypotheses which lie at the foundation of geometry.\" By this, the geometry of Euclid is found to be a small subset of the geometries of Riemann. The foundations for Einstein's relativity of space-time were set here. Hang onto your Newtonian physics, as I will try to de- Flatlander Figure 1 MAY 1994 NUMBER 313 PAGE 9"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL Figure 2 scribe these phenomena with as little mathematics as 1 can. Late in the nineteenth century, a delightful primer in dimensional mechanics was written by Edwin Abbott (1884), called Flatland. In this Victorian romance, two- dimensional creatures (Flatlanders) are described. Generally, they perceive things as lines with angles be- ing seen as darker or lighter shades. By analogy, we 3-D beings perceive objects as 2-D shapes with depth being seen as darker or lighter shades, that is, perspective or binocular stereo vision. These are all learned properties of perception which develop after birth to augment our basic 2-D visual sense system into 3-D-like spatial per- ceptions. We do, after all, perceive depth in a flat tele- vision screen. In Flatland we are given to understand, by analogy, how these 2-D creatures experience the un- usual properties of a 3-D object when they encounter one. For this exercise of trans-dimensional mechanics, imagine how a Flatlander will perceive the movements of a 3-D object, say a simple equilateral pyramid. The Flatlander is capable of seeing only that part of the pyramid that intersects with its plane of perceptual existence. The apparent size of the triangle it sees is thought to be of width equal to one of the sides of in- tersection. If the pyramid moves laterally, the Flatlander would see it merely move in the accustomed manner for its dimension. If the pyramid begins to move in the vertical dimension, however, the Flatlander will per- ceive it to change in size and maybe shape: either grow- ing larger or smaller. Even though the pyramid has a fixed shape, it will appear to the Flatlander to be actively altering its external shape. Eventually it may disappear altogether as the tip of the pyramid pulls up out of the plane of perception, and it may pop into perception at some distant point by lowering back into Flatland: movement from point hither to yon without perceptibly moving through any intervening points. Now, say the curious Flatlander enters the pyramid through some sort of portal. What happens on these thresholds is very peculiar to the 2-D creature. From its plane of existence, it gets physically folded onto a ver- tical wall of the pyramid. It cannot perceive this folding motion since its sense organs cannot perceive the verti- cal, but once its sense organs come onto the new upward wall, it sees a new plane of sensation much larger than it expected. If it dances back and forth over this folded threshold, our Flatlander can verify that the outside re- mains a constant, relatively small size and shape, while its interior is a vast new area. The 3-D object is not ex- pending any energy to change or hide its shape, but the 2-D perception is incapable of understanding what it is seeing. In a similar manner, if our Flatlander wanders around inside a 3-D structure it may find navigation does not follow understandable rules of movement. Since it can- not perceive the vertical folds, it cannot understand its motion through space by planar navigation. In the ex- ample above, the flatlander travels from point A on one plane, then to point B on another, and finally to point C. Its 2-D perception does not register what is happening when it passes through one of the folds, but the PAGE 10 NUMBER 313 MAY 1994"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL Figure 3 c B I A Flatlander will be confused when it returns to A from C according to its navigation. So, far from dismissing Michel's observation as dis- tressing, a very good mathematician can understand them as a trans-dimensional technology. Some of you may recall the study of a geometric curiosity in grade school, called a tesseract. This is the 4-D equivalent of a cube, an equidistant right-angled structure in four di- mensions. Of course, the 3-D projection of this object looks sqewed and odd, but we are assured that in four di- mensions it has 8 equi-volumed spaces. The intersection in 3-D space may appear to be, say, a ten meter maxi- mum distance, but an apparent straightline traversal of the 4-D interior would require 30 meters of travel. Michel's visual estimate of his UFO's internal dimen- sions is within this magnitude of simple geometry. The folds of 3-D space into a 4-D structure would be very interesting to study. In Einsteinian terms, matter warps space to create gravity. Folding a craft into 4-D space ought to create extremely strong gravitational ef- fects on its boundaries. I believe that is essentially what a wormhole is. The center of a black hole produces gravitational forces so strong that the warp of space crumples 3-D. Non-adjacent coordinates come into im- mediate proximity so that intervening positions do not need to be traversed. Stepping into a 4-D tesseract ought to encounter gravity so strong it would disintegrate nor- mal molecular and atomic bonds. What 1 have been discussing here is a 4-D architec- ture. A static structure which must take tremendous quantities of energy to fabricate. Most readers are prob- ably familiar with the notion that 4-D involves time, a dynamic process. Our senses perceive 4-D movement of time to be a fairly constant process over which we have no control. We are all time travelers, but we cannot alter our course. The physics of matter seem to agree with this constancy, at least down to the atomic level of organi- zation. The best clocks are based upon the atomic state oscillations of hydrogen. We are discovering that time becomes less constant at quantum levels under physi- cally extreme conditions. In reading this discussion of 4-D properties in some UFO reports, I should give a warning before we jump to the conclusion: \"Aha, at least some UFOs are time trav- elers.\" (Davenport, 1992) Maybe they are, but we are not gaining anything in explanatory power by such a hy- pothesis. H.G. Wells (1895) started this notion that time travel is somehow quite simple if we can master the ba- sic phenomena. After all. moving something a few min- utes in time, but to stay in the same 3-D coordinates does not seem like much. Only time is being traversed, not space. In George Pal's movie version of The Time Machine, actor Rod Taylor simply pushes the lever, the device disappears, and sometime later it reappears when the temporal motive force is discontinued. It seems to stay in the same place. Unfortunately, H.G. Wells did not understand trans-dimensional mechanics very well. The foundations of relativity are based on the fact that there are no absolute measures of dimension. Everything has to be measured relative to something else. There is no universal constant (yet discovered at least) that is ab- solute. Hence, any movement in time is going to also in- volve a movement in space. Quite a large movement in space. Nothing sits absolutely still. The notion of time travel increases the technological requirements over mere interstellar travel. Consider me sitting here in Pensacola typing this message. At the equator, the planet's surface is spinning around its axis about 636 kilometers a second. At lati- tude 30 degrees for Pensacola, the circular motion is around 551 meters per second. If I were to time travel, even for one second, I would need to displace my spatial coordinates more than 5 football fields just to keep an apparently constant position. To put this another way.

A nd the speed of the Earth's rotation is relatively leisurely in cosmic terms. We have to also factor in the speed of the Earth's movement around the sun (39.6 km per sec) and the movement of the sun around galac- tic centra] (220 km per sec) and, of course, the move- ment of our galaxy away from the big bang (well, no one really seems to know how fast or in what direction our galaxy is moving. I have seen estimates ranging from 14 to 3000 km per sec). Can you imagine the computer which has to add or subtract these speeds de- pending on what part of the rotations we are in at a given instant? To talk about controlled time travel in large units (like Earth years) we are necessarily includ- ing spatial movements on the order of light years. SET! scientists generally discount UFOs on the basis of energy requirements needed to traverse interstellar distances in relativistic spacetime (Drake and Sobel, 1992). They refer to this as the interstellar quarantine. The energy requirements are so large that civilizations will stay around their native stars rather than travel be- tween them. The notion of time travel increases this energy expenditure by orders of magnitude. Perhaps Steven Hawking will calculate this out for us some- time. I n the meantime, we should consider where Michel and others might have gotten the notion of 4-D structure (bigger inside than out) if these reports are based on so- cial contamination (conscious fraud or subconscious Tesseract 8 3D Spaces imagery) rather than actual alien technology. The dates \"1961 or 1962\" given in the report (Mesnard, 1994) are a bit suggestive. As I mentioned in the introduction of this note, the notion of dimensions beyond 3-D does not seem to appear in history until 1854. But on the night that John Kennedy was assassinated (22 Nov 1963), the BBC began broadcasting a television program which features a properly constructed 4-D vehicle (\"An Unearthly Child,\" Dr Who). The TARDIS is bigger in- side than out, and this is mentioned often in the series. Dr Who became one of the most successful fantasy pro- grams ever broadcast, being discontinued in 1989 after 27 years of production. Michel's report of seeing a 4-D craft was not made until 1978 and then he was recalling back 17 years to \"1961 or 1962.\" Or 1963 maybe? The opportunity for social contamination certainly is avail- able after November, 1963 which is the earliest popular portrayal of a 4-D structure that I know of. But not the only one. How long have illusionists been pulling the rabbit out of the hat? Something-out-of- the-hat and similar illusions are based on the surprise of drawing large objects out of small spaces. This is basi- cally a property of 4-D containers—you could put a lot in them. It would not surprise me if out-of-the-hat illu- sions began appearing after Riemann's famous lecture at the University of Gottingen. Whether this inside-too-big phenomenon is actual alien technology or deliberate fraud or a subconscious psychological trick of perception, it is nevertheless based on good mathematics and related to the funda- mental physics of our universe. That makes it interesting to me at least.

By David B. Clemens I n a relatively remote area of Southern Colorado lies the spectacular Sangre de Cristo mountain range, whose jagged 14,000-foot peaks thrust skyward from 7,000-foot valleys in roughly a north/south straight- edge. Recently declared a National Wilderness Area, the range holds more mysteries than just the rumors of Conquistador gold buried deep in seemingly bottomless caves at near the 12,000-foot level. Long before white man ever came to the San Luis Valley, which is bordered by the Sangre de Cristos to the east, Indians spoke of the \"sky people\" in \"flying bas- kets\" and of being led to safe underground caverns by the \"ant people\" during seismic upheavals. The valley, which reputedly has never seen conflict in the history of the world, is still considered sacred by numerous Indian tribes. Accounts of local individuals boarding strange craft and communicating with humanoid beings predate the Betty and Barney Hill case by many years. The first doc- umented case of an animal mutilation, \"Snippy\" the horse (actual name: Lady), occurred in the San Luis Valley in 1967. During the famous 1967-1975 flap period, UFO ac- tivity was so intense that during certain periods one could go out virtually any night and see strange lights in the sky. A crash/retrieval case dating from this time period has recently surfaced. In 1969, a family of four was con- ducting archeological site surveys for a major university on the border of the Great Sand Dunes National Monument when they observed an apparently disabled cylindrical object being chased by a military jet fighter. The fighter rode the object into the dunes while it fran- tically tried to get out from under the jet before crashing. At one point, the object passed directly overhead of the family at a altitude of approximately 400 to 500 feet in broad daylight. The object was later retrieved in a covert military operation. After complaining vigorously to many different agencies, the mother of the family was visited by a succession of U.S. Navy officers. This story was independently verified by Monument employees. A rash of cattle mutilations occurred from 1975 to 1982, although sightings of objects and lights seemed to subside during this period. During late 1992, cattle mutilations and UFO sight- ings returned with a vengeance. In the year ending December 1993. over 40 suspected mutilations occurred in the counties surrounding the Sangre de Cristo range. On April 29, 1993, the author encountered an hours-old cattle mutilation outside Chama, Colorado. The mutila- tion, which happened within 200 yards of the ranch house, had the classical smooth incisions at the cored-out rectum and removed udder. Electromagnetic surveys from 30 hertz through the ionizing range yielded no anomalous readings. Tissue samples analyzed by pathol- ogist Dr. John Altshuler of Denver indicated the inci- sions had been made with high heat other than by a laser. During the recent wave, objects and lights have been seen by day and night, often observed by multiple highly qualified witnesses. Some highlights: • November, 1992. Small glimmering lights seen on consecutive nights on southern Baca ranch. Woman feels compelled to drive to border of Boca ranch and loses two hours of time. • December, 1992. Rancher and others see laser-like ovals streak south and hover over Baca ranch area. Two women see bell-shaped object against mountains during daytime. • February, 1993. Bright white lights are seen de- scending below ridge of Sangres and then streaking north along top of range. Witness at Crestone camp- ground has car illuminated from above by spotlight beams that \"try and get him out of car.\" Two women see a bell-shaped object pass over their car while traveling south on Highway 17 nearMosca in daytime. • March, 1993. Two objects seen traveling down entire western side of the San Luis Valley. Military jets seen tracing objects' path on afterburner eight minutes later. • April, 1993. Four witnesses observe school bus-sized object near Monte Vista. • May, 1993. A research colleague of the author's and his girlfriend observe a 30-40 foot boomerang/wedge- shaped object at dusk descending in a figure-eight mo- tion. • November/December, 1993. Twelve witnesses (two are trained military observers) see bright bluish/white object streak south and descend in the La Garita area. Witnesses directly under object's path feel their houses vibrate like a \"silent sonic boom\" and feel \"pressure change.\" The following night seven apparently silent he- licopters are videotaped through night vision equip- MAY 1994 NUMBER 313 PAGE 13"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL ment dropping flares and surrounding a nearly hovering solid anomalous object in the same area. N aturally a hypothesis has been formulated that long- term anomaly areas such as the San Luis Valley are some type of \"doorway\" or \"portal,\" whether dimen- sional, electromagnetic, gravitational or a combination of the three. Certainly the Indians believed this. Is there any support for this hypothesis? Some researchers claim that there is a correlation between anomaly areas and anomalies found on U.S. Geological Survey magnetic and gravity maps. These researchers claim that one can go to anomaly areas indicated on these maps and the lo- cals will report the standard variety of mutilation/UFO/paranormal/government activity. The Sangre de Cristo area has extreme magnetic and gravi- tational variations according to these maps. Additionally, recent research at known anomaly areas such as Pine Bush, New York and Lucky Point, Indiana have indicated that there are bizarre and anomalous fluctuations in the earth's magnetic field at certain times. These fluctuations are sometimes accompanied by strong ground vibrations which can be detected without instruments and often are followed by lights/sightings. The magnetic variations can only be detected with so- phisticated equipment such as proton magnetometers and Hall effect/flux gate magnetometers that are con- nected to ocilliscopes. During sightings of the Zapata ranch ground lights in the San Luis Valley, a researcher noted ground vibrations strong enough to shake utility poles, which is identical to reports from Lucky Point, Indiana. These vibrations have nothing to do with seismic stresses or activities. The power company that maintains high tension lines that run through the Lucky Point area have no explana- tion for the vibrations that shake their poles in the area. As one might have surmised, the government is heav- ily involved in the events occurring in the Southern Colorado area. Researchers have been followed, phones tapped, photographs have disappeared, military con- voys have been seen going into deserted canyons and then disappearing. A colleague's family member awoke one night to see two silent helicopters hovering 30 feet from the house connected to each other by a red beam of light. Jet fighters or helicopters almost always follow the exact path that a UFO takes within 24 hours of the sighting. Some believe that they are monitoring/erasing electromagnetic signatures of the craft. As many re- searchers know, UFOs can leave residual magnetic fields in defiance of our understanding of physical laws. It is clear that the government or some quasifaction thereof understands the phenomena at a very high level. It is also clear that they are using a whole range of covert technologies such as silent helicopters. Ranchers and sheriffs who have been involved with mutilations do not talk about aliens and UFOs but rather unmarked, silent military helicopters associated with the incidents. A former deputy has said that he observed the U.S. military using silent helicopters in Viet Nam. If this is true, it suggests that the government is able to keep some technologies secret for over three decades. Recently there have been reports from individuals who have said that they served in ultra-secret military units that used silent black helicopters to mutilate cattle. Supposedly, the government can detect things in and un- der the ground by analyzing the tissues of the cattle. The events in Southern Colorado serve to quietly mock our accepted understanding of the nature of real- ity, who the \"government\" really is and what their in- tentions are.

An abductee wonders if abduction research — and some abductees — may not have wandered off the path. By Roberta Puhalski T his past February marked six years of my \"per- sonal\" involvement with what I'll term the Abductee Movement. Every movement has its unique development expressed and defined by stages that can be observed. Over the years I have witnessed this movement come full circle. Early in the movement, abductees, fueled by frustra- tion, fear or desperation, worked up enough courage to seek out professional help. I am using the word \"ab- ductee\" as this is a term with which we are familiar. I am in no way stating that, in fact, they have been abducted. Abductees were caught up in a life of passivity, waiting for the next uninvited experience. They descended upon the offices of therapists and researchers, anyone who would offer a sympathetic ear. Endlessly, in the style of \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner,\" they would recant their tales. Abductees were relieved to learn that their stories were being given serious consideration. Researchers and investigators were bound to the role of arm chair observers, while attempting to focus in on and ascertain the real significance of these experiences, wisely withholding judgment as data continued to flow in from all sources, including sightings, crop circles, and cattle mutilations. Many articles were published, lectures delivered, and books written on this subject and the in- terpretations of same. In a twinkling of an eye, the books and movies gave abductees a public platform, a type of legitimacy. They enjoyed their new role, and the attention it afforded them was not a bad thing in itself, as it did change the way they viewed themselves. At the same time many self-help groups formed, fa- cilitated by either researchers or abductees themselves. I facilitated such groups for three years. At these meet- ings abductees and contactees could let their hair down without fear of recrimination. This was a place where the exchange of information took place, as well as net- working. Week after week I heard people complain of how their personal relationships were deteriorating, or of an inability to concentrate on their job, or of loss thereof. For many these experiences kept them from being able to focus in on anything else. Researcher and author. Kenneth Ring, as well as some others, became aware of behavioral and psychological correlations among U.F.O. experiencers. Was there such a thing as an Abductee/Contactee personality type? Researchers wouldn't have to twist my arm to get me to believe this! I observed this myself during these meetings. While watching everyone interact, many things became painfully clear. While abductees came together as strangers, they soon discovered that they shared similar childhood experiences, attitudes and memories. Their childhoods generally were marked with dissociation and \"multiple parallel consciousness.\" Many of them re- ported childhood abuse. I often wondered whether ab- ductees suffered this abuse because they danced to the tune of a different drummer. There are even more in- sidious theories floating around questioning the possi- bility of intentional psychological manipulation. So far, none of the more complex issues have been satisfactorily addressed. I was very impressed with Victoria Alexander's comments in the MUFON UFO Journal (November 1993) article entitled \"New Protocol for Abduction Research.\" She questions how these is- sues can be addressed with the present chaotic atmos- phere in this field. H ow did this ever happen? During the last year that I facilitated the self-help groups, I noticed a shift in the emphasis of purpose. Instead of the usual group therapy type atmosphere of caring and sharing, New Age material slowly filtered its way into these meetings. Initially there were books on metaphysics and esoteric information. Then emerged the crystals and healing techniques. Next there were books claiming to be trance- channelled messages from the stars. Within months peo- ple were aligning with one alien group or another, and arguing with each other! Some wore pins and badges honoring their favorite group of aliens. It became in- creasingly difficult for an abductee to participate without accepting New Age doctrine or taking sides. This ab- surdity, when witnessed at conventions, concerned and embarrassed me. So, I refrained from holding meetings and instead followed writing pursuits. While attending local MUFON state meetings and conventions, I became influenced by John Keel's ob- servations, books, and delightful sense of humor. I think of him, particularly, during late night excursions to lo- cations of \"high strangeness,\" in desolate areas, while chasing shadowy figures and strange anomalous lights. Is this some cruel cosmic joke, perpetrated by travel- weary aliens? Yet, abductions continue to be reported, on an ever in- creasing frequency. The Truth about abductions is, that we are no closer scientifically to really knowing the truth! Perhaps we do need a new approach. If research suggests that abductees might possess a particular psy- chological profile, there must be other correlations of a Continued on Page 17 MAY 1994 NUMBER 313 PAGE 15"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL NEW YORK CROP FORMATION INVESTIGATION A four-circle crop formation with pathways near Columbia Center, New York is found puzzling. By Jim Cormia I t began with a small, one-column front page article that appeared in the Herkimer Evening Telegram on Monday, July 26, 1993. The article stated that a North Carolina truck driver had observed round, cylin- drical-shaped objects near Robinson Road just off Rt. 28. He would not identify himself. Then on Thursday, July 29, 1993 the same newspaper ran a full-blown front page article including a large roadside photo of the crop formation. That's how it began. It ended with well over a thousand curious onlookers, extensive media coverage locally and nationally (CNN), and an on- slaught of paranormal phenomenona investigators all \"doing their thing\"! The landowner at the time the formation was first seen and for several weeks thereafter was Helen Pyc, who has since completed the sale of the land, located in Herkimer County, near Columbia Center, New York. The crop formation was located about one-quarter mile South of the Pyc farm, just off the West side of Route 28. The medium was \"short oats\" (Avena sativa). The oats were flattened very close (matted) to the ground and there was no apparent intertwined or braiding effect, nor was there any spiraling effect noted in any of the four circles. All the oats were bent at or just above the ground and all were creased at the bending point. The formation consisted of four circles with four intercon- necting pathways. The diameter of the smallest circle (circle #1) was 20 feet, 5 inches. The diameter of circle #2 was 45 ft. Circle #3's diameter was 43 ft., 5 in., and the largest circle (#4) was 88 feet. All four circles were slightly elliptical in the general direction of magnetic North to South. Circles number 1, 2, and 3 were laid down in a clockwise direction. Circle #4 was laid down in a counterclockwise direction. Pathway \"A\" protruded halfway into circle #2 as did pathway \"D\" into circle #3. All other pathways terminated at the very outer edge of the circle they were connecting. Pathway \"C\" con- tained three parallel lines created by two rows of stand- ing goldenrod. All compass, EMF, and gieger counter readings were normal and no anomalous sounds were heard or recorded by tape recorders, either in or outside of the formation. Circles #2, 3 & 4 formed an isosceles triangle with base angles of 41 degrees and a vertex angle of 96 degrees. Circles #1, 2 & 4 formed a scalene triangle with the vertex angle being obtuse at 114 de- grees with base angles of 23 and 43 degrees. The NY State Police, East Herkimer Station, very thoroughly investigated the crop formation as property damage purposely perpetrated by pranksters. They made no arrests nor did they turn up any evidence that would suggest a prank or hoax. Four experienced farmers who have seen numerous forms of lodging all agreed this for- mation was definitely not the result of wind. Two inde- pendent groups, the Central NY Questers (an indepen- dent investigative group from the Syracuse, NY area), myself and Keith Conroy (MUFON) all searched the im- mediate area for any indication of hoaxing and found nothing. On August 7th, 1993 I met Ron Taylor and Mark Briggs (CNYQ) at the site to obtain oat samples in ac- cordance to protocols established by experienced crop circle investigators and Dr. W.C. Levengood, a bio- physicist in Michigan. Two sets of samples were taken from each location. Each set consisted of 6 stalks, the second set to be used as a \"back up\" and/or for further analysis. Two sets of samples were taken from the cen- ter, midway between the center and the outer perimeter, and just inside the outer perimeter of each circle. Two sets of samples were taken from the center of each path- way. Two sets of \"control\" samples (12 stalks per set) were taken from the oatfield 60 ft. and 180 ft. West NW of circle #4. On August llth, 1993 I shipped 17 crop formation samples and 2 control samples to Dr. Levengood for analysis. T he test results of Lab Report #19 are consistent with the extreme variability in the levels of the various factors studied. This variability seems to be consistent with formations in oats, unlike wheat, which is not as chaotic in its measurement levels. Node Bending: All samples showed greater degrees of bending of the fifth node on the stalk, the only node with significant bending when compared to the two controls. Although there are no clear patterns evident, it appears that a different distribution of energies occurred in Circles #1, #2, and #4 than in other locations. Node Swelling: The 4th and 5th nodes of the forma- tion stalks were actually split and in some cases holes were blown right through the tissue. Dr. Levengood has termed these holes \"expulsion cavities.\" Some of these \"expulsion cavities\" were so severe that the inter- nal cytoplasm was blown right through onto the surface of the plant. No splitting occurred in any of the controls. Seed Germination and Development Factor (Df): This is a combined measurement of the speed of germi- nation of the seeds and the rate of growth after germi- nation. There was no pattern seen in this formation; however, it was interesting that most of the formation samples had their growth suppressed when compared to the controls. When I returned to the site on Sept. 18th, PAGE 16 NUMBER 313 MAY 1994"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL 1993 I found the seeds on the stalks within the formation were already germinating while those in the standing crop were not. The seedlings within the formation were from 3 to 8 inches in length and when observed from a distance the entire formation shown a bright green in contrast to the grey unharvested oatfield. Alpha Change: This is a measurement of the electri- cal conductivity of the thin bract tissue that surrounds the seed. The large changes measured in this formation (particularly samples IB and 2B) are by themselves enough to indicate the impact of an external energy on the plants which are not consistent with mechanical flattening of the crop. This is the first formation in which negative alpha values have appeared, indicating lower amplitudes of electrical conductivity than what was measured in the controls. This seems to indicate a different pattern of heating ihan formations with positive values, i.e., an extended time period during which the energy was applied and/or a higher intensity applied within the same time frame. The ''t-test\": This is a culmination of data results de- rived from standard mathematical analysis to determine the degree of statistical significance of data when sam- ples are compared with controls. Note: The alpha values are obtained by an automated system, i.e., no observa- tions or measurements are made by Dr. Levengood un- til after the test run, at which time the results from the recorder chart are entered into the computer for analyses. Any t-test reading over 2 is statistically significant. A value of 3 means that the odds that these readings are due to random chance is less than one in ten thousand. Out of 17 t-test results, six were determined \"not sig- nificant,\" with the remaining 11 averaging a value of 3.88! This all but eliminates the chance that these read- ings were \"coincidental.\" D r. Levengood has generously given his time and expertise analyzing samples from over 80 crop for- mations. I thank him for sharing his test results and wish him much success in his ongoing search for the \"answer\"! Ron Taylor (CNYQ) was a tremendous help because he provided me with a multitude of information about crop formation investigative techniques, along with informing me of people to contact, plus his will- ingness to share any recent information that he had ac- quired. Everyone's motto should be like Ron's, that is, \"Hey. we're all in this together, right?\" Because of the many UFO sightings prior to and fol- lowing the appearance of this crop formation, one can probably guess who I feel is responsible for altering this normally \"peaceful\" oatfield. The bottom line is that, as humanly possible and with all the investigative results considered, my own \"call\" is that the Columbia Center, NY crop formation is genuine and not man- made.

Some people have told me they could pick abductees out of a group, that we possess a certain type of \"look.\" Abductees are being told that their DNA has been and is continuing to be altered. Is this true? With our new un- derstanding of genetic engineering, we may be able to verify these claims. We must establish new criteria by which we may increase the credibility of our investiga- tions. As far as we abductees are concerned, it is time for us to find our way out of this labyrinth for a \"reality check.\" Let us not be angry with those who question our space dramas. Let us critique our own behavior and ex- periences. At conventions and gatherings people ob- serve our behavior and judge us based on that. Before going too far out on a limb, we must regain and maintain our sense of reality. Once people view us as nuts or charlatans it will be very difficult to regain their respect or interest in helping us. It would serve our best interest to publicly tone down our proselytism of New Age material and return our attention to the real issues.

In reality, the two were amateur bird- watchers and water color artists in their sixties, Doug Bower and David Chorley. who claimed to have single- handedly created the crop circle phenomenon by carving out some 250 increasingly elaborate formations over the years, beginning in the summer of 1978. Their initial claim, which appeared, with photos, in the pages of the British tabloid Today in early September, 1991 was greeted with both scorn and deri- sion by the English crop circle community. Still, noted cereologist Pat Delgado who, with co-author Colin Andrews, had written the best-selling crop circle book of all times. Circular Evidence, had been publicly embar- rassed by one of their creations, pronouncing as genuine a so-called \"pictogram\" they had created the day before near Sevenoaks for Today reporter Graham Brough and others. Within a year, virtually every leading cereologist in the field would be similarly caught out. However, a daylight demonstration for the press arranged by Brough went badly for the two later that same week. By all accounts, and almost all published photographs, the half-finished formation was a poor, ragged affair compared to the \"real thing\" with which everyone was now familiar, or at least thought they were. Ultimately, it came down to a matter of belief— one either believed Doug & Dave or one didn't, for they had little to offer in the way of real evidence other than their own anecdotal testimony and a few plans or diagrams. Admittedly, their claims seemed preposterous on the surface. Circles were not only popping up all over south- ern England, but as far abroad as New Zealand, Japan. Canada and the United States. Certainly Doug & Dave couldn't conceivably be responsible for the worldwide outbreak of crop circles. Nor could they account, even by their own calculations, for the more than 2000 circles now reported. Things went from bad to worse in a proverbial hurry. Initially ridiculed as mere braggarts or publicity-seekers, Doug & Dave were soon being villified as active agents of a disinformation campaign aimed directly at the crop circle phenomenon, possibly orchestrated by—take your pick—the Vatican, the CIA, or some other shadowy or- ganization capable of carrying off a grand conspiracy on a global scale. Doug & Dave seemed somewhat shocked and of- fended by the reception they received and almost im- mediately announced their \"retirement.\" Innocent or otherwise, however, their confession had a consider- able impact. When I visited England the following summer, most prominent cereologists were much more cautious in their public pronouncements as to which circles were \"real\"' and which ones weren't. No one ap- peared willing to go on record but in the most general terms. In private, over a pint or two, most conceded that the phenomenon was now riddled—or \"discred- ited,\" if you prefer—with widespread human hoaxing. Indeed, shortly before my arrival, the Cereologist, the Guardian newspaper and a German magazine spon- sored a crop circle-making contest with several con- siderable cash prizes for the winners. Over a dozen teams competed in the overnight contest, a three-man team no one had ever heard of before finishing first. Jim Schnabel, an American graduate student and writer working alone, came in second. Doug and Dave were conspicuous only by their absence, further fueling claims that their vaunted prowess was more publicity stunt than anything else. All in all, though, those cereolo- gists to whom I talked who had actually been at the conference had come away generally, if begrudgingly, impressed with the quality of the product on display. Humans, it turned out, could do a fairly good job in the fields of England by night, after all. A fter a second summer vacation spent stalking crop circles my own doubts were growing, too. Accordingly, in the November. 1992 issue of the Journal, I published an article by Schnabel with the title of \"Confessions of a Crop Circle Spy.\" A year later Schnabel would go into even greater detail about his own hoaxing activities with his first book. Round in Circles. To say I was unprepared for the emotional in- tensity of the response to the publication of Schnabel's original article would be a major understatement. Irate faxes and phone calls flew back and forth across the Atlantic; one prominent cereologist even threatened to join a libel suit against MUFON and the Journal. If anything, the reaction to Schnabel's unrepentant con- fession of hoaxing was even more vehement than the public reaction to Doug & Dave's had been. Schnabel— and by extension myself—was accused of all sorts of in- tellectual and scientific perfidy. What the offended parties seemed to object to most was their own growing inner realization of just how PAGE 18 NUMBER 313 MAY 1994"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL All but the most stubbborn and devout should come away from a reading of Cropc/rc/e Apocalypse with the suspicious feeling that we've all been royally had. easy it was to hoax a circle, even one of the large, com- plex pictograms. Moreover, if the self-appointed \"ex- perts\" couldn't tell the difference between the genuine article and a human hoax at a glance, who among us could? In very real ways their authority and expertise— upon which speaking invitations, book contracts and media appearances depended—was being slowly but surely eroded, if not undercut altogether. Thus, perhaps, the ulterior motives so easily and readily attributed to the Dougs, Daves and Jims was now causing chaos in their chosen field. Frankly, I don't expect to see all that much of a philo- sophical sea change among English (and no doubt some North American) cereologists as a consequence of John Macnish's recently self-published Cropcircle Apocalypse, although the author's motives in writing same would appear to be above reproach. The fact of the matter is that Macnish, a former BBC reporter before he created his own independent video production com- pany, Circlevision, was also once a believer, having produced the pro-mystery video, \"Cropcircle Communique,\" distributed in this country by Linda Moulton Howe Productions. But Macnish also main- tained his reporter's instincts and was determined, ulti- mately, to get to the bottom of the picture. Were crop cir- cles paranormal in nature or not? Were Doug & Dave merely blowing smoke or trying, albeit in their own bumbling way, to set the record straight? Whatever else it does—and it goes without saying that those who don't want to be convinced won't be— Apocalypse ties up any number of loose ends, beginning with Doug & Dave's non-appearance at the crop circle making contest: they had previously entered into an agreement with Macnish to go underground and remain silent for a year, documenting at least part of their claims in the process. Using infrared and night-vision equip- ment, Macnish was able to work with and document the activities of other known and confessed hoaxers as well, Schnabel included. All but the most stubborn and devout should come away from a reading of Apocalypse with the suspicious feeling that we've all been royally had, Steven Greer's CSETI program and most major cereol- ogists included. During a 1992 nightwatch atop Woodborough Hill near Alton Barnes, Wiltshire, for instance, CSETI members reported the sighting of a \"structured craft,\" which Macnish clearly associates with a helium balloon \"UFO\" launched by known pranksters. What about the thousands of crop circles reported in the UK alone? Curiously, as it turns out, cereologists counted a \"quintuplet\" or \"Celtic cross\" (a central circle surrounded by a ring with four satellite circles) as five circles; Doug & Dave counted same as a single forma- tion. In other words, the numbers were vastly inflated to begin with. Nor did Doug & Dave ever claim to have created each and every crop circle around the world. As early as 1986, at Cheesefoot Head, they had carved out in giant letters \"WE ARE NOT ALONE\" in response to their growing competitors. Later they began signing their own artwork with their trademark initials, \"DD,\" but these, too, were promptly interpreted by the para- normalists in terms of the actions of a \"higher intelli- gence.\" How offended should we be by the actions of Doug & Dave and other confessed hoaxers? Not very is my guess. After all, we contributed directly to the prob- lem. If cereologisls hadn't constantly kept interpreting the circles in terms of ever increasing complexity and in- telligence, who's to say the game wouldn't have run its natural course long ago? Doug & Dave, at least, were having a lark. Who wouldn't be encouraged, wak- ing up to the morning paper, to find their art interpreted as UFO tracks, the goddess Gaia, unknown earth ener- gies and/or God only knows what else? C ereologists ultimately fell into two fundamentally separate camps: those who were bewildered by the phenomenon on its face, and those who said to them- selves, however secretly, I wonder if I can do that? Those who tried creating their own circles—crudely at first, but perfecting their technique by repeated prac- tice—could only have been encouraged by the public's response, especially when their handiwork was judged genuine and displayed on TV or video. Doug & Dave thought the game had gone on too long, that the gullible parties had profited too much on what, when all was said and done, was their own artwork. To their dismay, they also discovered that they had lost any copyright, making them Pound-foolish if penny wise. It's not too late for the rest of us to profit, however, even at the cost of a few cherished notions. Unfortunately, Apocalypse will see little circulation in this country, along with Crop Circles: A Mystery Solved by Jenny Randies and Paul Fuller, and Schnabel's Round in Circles. Anyone who's seriously interested in the crop circle literature should seek out all three before jumping to any rash conclusions about the \"paranor- mal\" nature of the phenomenon. The Randies and Fuller book, a paperback update of their 1990 hardback of the same name, holds out the hope that there may be something to Terence Meaden's meteorological hypothesis after all—Meaden has pro- posed that simple circles, at least, and some UFOs may be attributable to an electrically charged \"plasma vor- tex.\" The update isn't complete enough, however, and there's the gnawing feeling that the authors are trying to have their scones and eat them, too, although they hardly subscribe to the paranormal theory. MAY 1994 NUMBER 313 PAGE 19"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL Schnabel's book, by far the best written and enter- taining of all three, has just been released as a Penguin paperback. The author is under a cloud of suspicion in some circles, but, given recent developments and reve- lations, such as Macnish's, it's increasingly hard to see why. To its detriment. Apocalypse has been amateurishly published. Errors of spelling and grammar abound on al- most every page, detracting from what is otherwise a sterling investigation, faults that will no doubt be held against it by its more determined critics and skeptics. At the same time, taken in context with the other two books and Doug & Dave's original confession, it's hard to see how any objective observer, having read Cropcircle Apocalypse, will ever look at another crop circle in quite the same light again. MUEQN.EQRUM Letters to Mufon UFO Journal SCIENTIFIC CREDIBILITY In response to the letter in the March issue by Dr. Stuart Appelle in which he suggests that this Journal should strive to be more scientifically credible, scientific credibility is fine where appropriate. But science is not the be-all and end-all of existence as some, including too many scientists, seem to believe. Science simply does not apply to all areas of interest or importance. All facts are not scientific facts. Whether or not our government is withholding information about UFOs is a fact, but not a scientific fact. One does not expect lawyers, artists, politicians, school teachers, or detectives to be scientif- ically credible, although science may be useful to these persons. The scientific method, at least in the narrow sense, is simply not applicable to all fields of investiga- tion. Science is hardly geared to handle disinformation, for instance. When one does not have a very good feel for the territory, one is not in a position to make hard and fast judgments about what kind of information is rele- vant or useful. When one is dealing with another intel- ligence, and an alien one at that, as seems likely, or at least possible, in the field of ufology, the scientific method does not spring to mind as the most appropriate approach. Scientific credibility has high standards, indeed. If a person were to restrict himself only to scientifically credible evidence upon which to make decisions about everything in his life, he would certainly not get very far. Why should this burden be placed upon ufology? Obviously not all evidence or information is of equal quality, but who is qualified to accept or reject any of it? Ufology has not progressed to the point where scientific credibility can be used as a criterion any more than it can be used as a criterion for judging the acceptability of tes- timony by a witness in a trial. Scientific credibility has a nice sound, but too often it seems that it is, like beauty, in the mind of the beholder. It seems that too often it is just a substitute for the term political correctness. The arbiters of scientific credibil- ity believe that they know what is and is not possible, what is and is not good evidence. But this can be para- doxical. Science is supposed to be concerned with new discoveries. But who, pray tell, is qualified to judge what new discoveries are possible? What it all comes down to is a matter of good sense, integrity, and perhaps most of all, open-mindedness. Unfortunately, these qual- ities are in short supply in humanity in general. Ufology needs to consider every possible clue avail- able. And I, for one, think that the Journal is in good hands and is doing a wonderful job of a difficult task, and I would like to take this opportunity to say how much I appreciate it. — Michael S. LaMoreaux Ann Arbor, MI MUFON 1994 ANNUAL AWARD Congratulations must first be extended to the 792 people who voted for their favorite candidate from the 4731 ballots enclosed in the February 1994 issue of the MUFON UFO Journal. Obviously, a ballot inserted with the Journal at 17% response was far more effec- tive than a volunteer postcard vote that yielded only 3%. A decision had previously been made to discontinue this prestigious recognition if a significant voting response was not forthcom- ing. 17% is certainly an improvement over the 3% postcard vote. Two-time awardee, Budd Hopkins, was again the recipient of MUFON's annual award of an engraved plaque and a monetary award of $500, having received 214 votes. Three other candidates, receiving over 100 votes, were Stanton T. Friedman (155), Linda M. Howe (132) and Leonard Stringfield (113). Linda M. Howe is a previous winner of this recognition by her colleagues. It is a distinct pleasure to honor Budd Hopkins for the third time through a vote by his friends in Ufology.

This gleaming planet skirts half a degree above the Beehive Cluster on the 19th. Jupiter (-2.3), in Virgo, while not as bright as Venus, never- theless dominates the southern sky at dusk. The big planet pro- ceeds westward during the night. Bright Planets (Morning Sky): Mars (1.2), in Aries, rises in the NE about 3 AM but remains low in the E through the dawn hours. Jupiter sets in the W about 2:30 AM in mid-June. Saturn (1.0), in Aquarius, rises in the E about 12:30 AM in mid-month. The ringed world lies in the SE at dawn. It begins retrograde or westward motion on June 24. After 7 years of great viewing, the angle of Saturn's rings is closing. SETI Update II: After Congress cut off NASA's funds last fall for its search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI), the former manager of the project, the SETI Institute in California, has turned to private donors and is proceeding to raise the $7.3 million needed to restore part of the old effort. Now appropriately tagged Project Phoenix (after the mythical bird reborn from its own ashes), the resurrected search hopes to transfer the SETI detector on the 1,000-foot Arecibo, Puerto Rico, radio antenna to the 210-foot Parkes Radio Observatory \"dish\" in Australia sometime next year. The receiver will then scan so- lar-type stars for signs of artificial radio signals. (See Oct. 1992 and Feb. 1994 Night Sky.)

The stellar trio is composed of Vega, Deneb, and Altair. Each star in turn occupies its own constellation—respec- tively, Lyra the Harp, Cygnus the Swan, and Aquila the Eagle. Squarely on the meridian at 11 PM is a semicircle of 7 stars, Corona Borealis, the legendary crown offered to Princess Ariadne by Bacchus. Just to the E of it lies a 4-sided wedge of faint stars called the Keystone of Hercules. Look for a very dim fuzzy \"star\" along the right side of the wedge. This faint object is the Hercules Cluster—not one star but a ball of thousands of stars packed into a vast globular cluster. Telescopes of increasing size resolve the spot into more and more stars. The Hercules Cluster is 21,000 light-years away. Scorpius, the little arachnid that stung mighty Orion on the foot causing his death, has begun its summer sojourn across the southern horizon. The creature's heart is marked by red- dish Antares, and its curling tail is rather easily seen. May 20-22 — Tampa UFO Convention, Holiday Inn, Tampa, FL International Airport.

WESTERN MICHIGAN UFO SIGHTINGS The western Michigan UFO flap that started on the night of Monday, March 7, 1994. with visual sightings being confirmed that night by the National Weather Service radar in Muskegon, Michigan, plus over 125 eyewitnesses reporting during a two-week period, will be reported in an upcoming feature article in the Journal. Shirley Coyne and her Michigan investigative team have been inundated with sighting reports requiring in- terviews, thus delaying a final report. Walt Andrus interviewed, by telephone, a pilot who was over Lake Michigan, while enroute from Chicago Midway Airport to Grand Rapids, Michigan, when he and the co-pilot observed a converging white ball of light approaching their airfreighter on the night of March 7th. When they inquired about \"traffic\" near their air- craft, Chicago Airways Traffic Control advised that no other objects were being \"pamied\" on their radar scopes in the immediate vicinity. After observing the white light that was about 30 degrees above them for ten min- utes, it abruptly changed direction and flew straight north over Lake Michigan, disappearing rapidly. A sec- ond traffic control operator later told the two pilots, \"that unusual objects were being reported over western Michigan that evening.\" , MJ-12 AND THE GOVERNMENT: A Report on Government Involvement in the UFO Crash Retrievals (113 pages) by Grant Cameron and T.
