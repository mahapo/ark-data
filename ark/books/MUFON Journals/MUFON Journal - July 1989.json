FROM THE EDITOR Few articles have generated so much heat or controversy in recent memory as that by,Dr. Kenneth Ring, \"Towards an Imag- inal Interpretation of UFO Abductions,\" which appeared in the May issue of the Journal. My own interpretation is that few commentators paid close enough attention to what Mr. Ring defined as \"imaginal.\" Instead, the word was immediately trans- lated as meaning \"imaginary\" or non-real, which is far removed from his original point. A few questioned the reality of a \"third, imaginal kingdom\" as a legitimate physical realm. Fair and good. On the other hand, how do they so glibly explain the presence, seemingly in violation of physical laws as we know them, of so many varied extraterres- trial life forms on our planet? If we are willing to violate the con- straints of Einsteinian space and time with so much ease, then why are we so eager to prohibit similar violations between the possibly outmoded distinctions of mind and matter? A space- traveling species, after all, will have inevitably learned as much about the one as the other. In fact, as Arthur C. Clarke once mused, \"future technology will appear as magic.\" I suggest that we cannot have our cake and eat it. If we are willing to admit the existence of envoys of an extraterrestrial civil- ization, advanced as that implies, then why the reluctance to grant them equal technological prowess in realms other than interstellar travel?

Time was, seemingly not so long ago, when it appeared that a single simple act of Congress, the new, improved Freedom of Information Act, or FOIA, now popularly referred to as \"foya,\" would change the face of ufology (and by minor extension, the world) almost overnight. Here was the one tool, the final screw driver, we believed, that would force the Air Force, Navy, Marines and even Coast Guard (not to mention the CIA, NSA and a host of other official secretive acronyms) to reluctantly regurgitate that which we had been maintaining for years, if not decades: namely that They-Knew-All-About-UFOs-All-Along. What an orgy of anticipatory glee we exulted in! What shudders of delight we suffered in stifled silence, awaiting the moment when The New York Times, or even a lesser entity like \"60 Minutes,\" would finally inter- rupt our TV dinners to announce what the chosen few had known all along: that the government or their co-conspirators were a bunch of col- lusive scoundrels who had hidden the Truth from the collective American people. And better yet, that only twelve disciples, the precise numerical make-up of the mystical, majesterial MJ-12, all devout followers of the secular president of these United States, knew such things could be, and kept it from us for our own social and mental health safety. (Am I the only one who has noticed it, or isn't it odd that the number 12 conspicu- ously associates with a certain Naza- rene carpenter of days past? And does my addled memory fail, or wasn't another same mythical dozen at one time supposed to be the total number of people in the world who reputedly understood Einstein's general theory of relativity? Hmmm.) MUFON UFO Journal, No. 255, July 1989 DOST WOJttI; EVERYTHING IS GOING TO BE ALL RIGHT LOUIS Faith Endures Over the decades, faith endured that the meek grass roots would pre- vail yet, never mind that as someone pointed out a couple of years back, that if UFOs u>ere real, then they were obviously too important to be left to the likes of amateur civilian ufologists like me and thee. Faith endured. Our faith seemed vindicated when the CIA, the Defense Intelligence Agency, and a veritable alphabet soup of various military intelligence head- quarters suddenly coughed up reams of badly Xeroxed official documents, proving beyond skeptical doubt that their files were as clogged with UFO reports as they were with job perfor- mance reviews and mindless, anal- retentive regulations. And this at a time, remember, when the snide, crit- ical cynics of the Sixties, a scant decade before, had suggested that \"military\" and \"intelligence\" were non- sequiturs, did not compute. Yet this abrupt and profuse paper revelation arose like a Phoenix, the result of a freedom of information act, which itself was the by-product of a presi- dential fuax pas of the first water. As quickly and profoundly as faith was substantiated, however, so was faith as severely abused. The lower echelons of the intelligence hierarchy, yea, even up into the CIA, duly dis- closed and made public their pre- viously hidden UFO documents on the order, in fact, of thousands of pages of same. Yet the National Security Agency, the shadowiest of all, the all-seeing eye atop the pyramid of secrecy, the guardian of the keys, bolstered by billions of \"black budget\" dollars, summarily refused. A refusal, incidentally, that was upheld in Fed- eral Court, confirming the conspiracy of covert government collusion. In short, faith among the faithful was surreptitiously (and promptly) restored. Interestingly, the in camera petition that achieved this reversal of FOIA naivete consists of precisely 24 pages, or twice the magical number twelve. Aside from the ubiquitous devious conspiractor, apparently our govern- ment is also comprised of the odd occult numerologist, though I leave the implications and the working out of that to others. Volunteers? In the meantime, faith has been sorely tried and tested. Some of our most precious and \"official\" UFO FOIA documents have had severe aspersions cast on their origins and authenticity. Readers of the last issue of this Journal, for example, should be exceedingly familiar by now with the blatant admission of hoax in regard to the famous Ellsworth AFB UFO landing, which allegedly resulted in the \"melted gun\" episode. How many other documents are similarly tainted? How many are not? Who, for that matter, is now \"sinless\" enough among us to cast the first stone? MJ-12 Even the maze of MJ-12 itself, 3"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"regardless of original intentions, is now so overgrown with weeds and overlain with obfuscation, deliberate or simply accidental, that the majority of us will be unto eternity in figuring it out. The FOIA itself, which once promised to deliver us from ignor- ance, has instead only led us deeper into the wilderness. Enlightened infor- mation should point the way out of the morass; instead, the adoption of one belief system over another remains the only viable option for some, primarily because the printed page can no longer be counted on to represent what it purports to. The foundation for establishing validity has fallen away from our very feet, even as our efforts and intentions have increased (dare I say twelvefold?) in that direction over the last decade or two. Why the present state of affairs, then, why the sorry miasma of mis- understanding in the one realm of ufology, if any, that should be whole- somely bereft of duplicity and decep- tion? Those inclined to turn to the ubiquity of government involvement may do so at this point, though I would still ask as well, where is the evidence for that? And if the evidence is printed, then how do you propose to prive its legitimacy? Where all doc- uments are suspect, is it any longer prudent to take any at face value, even those issuing from supposedy official government and library files? To continue the litany of questions, how accurate is the study of typefa- ces and document age? How effective is the security, even within govern- ment agencies, that is supposed to protect the virginity of original docu- ments? We have already seen in the long-running argument over the valid- ity of the MJ-12 papers, particularly in regard to the single-sheet \"Cutler memo,\" how lax such security sup- posedly is. Civilian Hoaxes Nor is this whole arena a problem that appertains only to UFOs. In recent years alone, at least two signif- icant \"civilian\" cases in widely separ- ated parts of the country have resulted in hoaxes, headlines, murder and sui- cide.

You look at those paintings and carvings of those Babylo- nians and Egyptians and what-not, and what have you got? You've got a fine- looking people with straight noses and the brisk trade presently growing up around UFO documents, is the absence of any legal statutes specifically aimed at the faking of UFO documents. How can it be against the law to pro- duce that which is denied in the first place? Perhaps a lawyer will be able to enlighten us as to the possible sta- tus of such cases. In the meantime, it's more a case of who, in official- dom, really cares? The world seems to spin just fine, with or without MJ- 12 being proved one way or the other. And it seems likely to go on spinning so, regardless of the \"final\" outcome of MJ-12, if such a remote prospect is itself any longer feasible. I bring these points up for several MUFON UFO Journal, No. 255, July 1989"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"GOVERNMENT ADMITS UFO WRONGDOING WASHINGTON - U. S. Governmcm officials admitted uxlay thai (hey have been withholding UFO information about Unidcniificd Hying Saucers from (he American public, including the existence of a su|icr secret, high-level agency, MJ-12, and the recovery of at least one flying saucer, along wilh three dead alien bodies, from the New Mexico desert in the late 1940's. The aliens, a lop security source said, hail from a planet roughly earth size, circling Zcla Rcticuli. approximately 13 light years distance. In the summer of 1952, five years after the crash of the scout ship, a diplomatic corps established contact through high-ranking military officers with the Truman administration. Both the crash and subsequent government contact were kept secret from the public until today, when a Bush administration spokesperson admitted the decades-long deception before a packed While House press conference. In a prepared printed release. President Bush said he had 'been outside the MJ-12 loop, but was relieved to see the rumors and the UFO thing finally cleared up, after (my) predecessor nearly gave the game away.* Apparently, the Reticulans had threatened to go public after Reagan intimations of an imminent extraterrestrial invasion which would draw the two major Superpowers together in a common defense. Their presence was not made known earlier. Bush said, because of then Cold War concerns that widespread global panic might break out, as had occurred on a smaller local scale following the Orson Welles' 1939 'War of the Worlds* radio broadcast At that time, normally reserved New Englanders ran riot in the streets, mugging at least three Munchkin extras on the set of The Wizard of the Oz.\" The Bush announcement was seen as a purely political ploy by some, intended to upstage a similar statement expected later in the day from Secretary General Gorbachev in Moscow. Gorbachev was expected to announce that the Soviets had also recovered two crashed flying disccs in the 1950's, which, due to their unidentifiable nature, were assumed to be 'advanced instruments of Western intervention.\" Gorbachev is also expected to admit that the UFOs, thought to be products of American technology, were instrumental in Kruschev's withdrawal of nuclear missiles from Cuba, within 90 miles of U.S. shores. The Secretary is already being quoted by some sources as saying, \"without the UFOs, World War III might have easily broken out in 1962. As it was, civilization was saved.\" American officials also admitted that much of the technology that gave the U.S. such a commanding lead during the 1950's and 60's was, in fact, derived from the fallen flying saucers. A Pentagon press officer said that UFO-derived technlogical breakthroughs included so-called Stealth technology and no-run nylon stockings. The Reticulans are said to average between 3 and 4-feet tall, and to have gray, dolphin- like skin, with large heads and wide, staring black eyes. They were said to have first visited Earth because \"it was there.\" A surviving Reticulan, rumored to beheld in a safe house somewhere in Nevada, was also quoted by the Pentagon official as saying Earth \"was a nice place to visit, but il wouldn't want to live here.\" The aliens are thought to like Steven Speilberg movies and strawberry ice cream, not necessarily in that order. The same official assured the press that \"they mean us no harm, and would simply like to return home. They're sorry if they caused any undue trouble. Because of what the Reticulans refer to as a 'Prime Directive,' they regret that they are unable to open active trade negotiations at this time, though they admit they have something that would make crack seem like a Sunday picnic.* Walter Andrus. Jr., international director of the Seguin, Texas, Mutual UFO Network, said, \"I guess this puts us out of business. My, what a long strange trip it's been.\" He said the organization's journal would cease publication with the next issue, a full disclosure of governmcnt- UFO tomfoolery. \"You read it here first,\" he said. Andrus said he will probably donate his back reasons, aside from the obvious ones referenced above. In another way, they show why it was so easy for the Fund for UFO Research to raise $16,000, literally overnight in terms of the slow response time normal to ufology, for Stanton Friedman's exten- sive investigation into the provenance of the MJ-12 papers. Would such an amount have been remotely feasible if we didn't share a collective faith in the ultimate reality of the printed word? How else explain this lust for a literary trail of paper, when equally significant research proposals go want- ing, floundering on the poverty of the field as a whole? Interestingly, one of the prime financial backers of the pro- ject is Whitley Strieber, who is on public record in two popular books as being at least suspicious of the abso- MUFON UFO Journal, No. 255, July 1989 lute physicalify of the phenomenon. Will he think his money well spent if Friedman turns up confirming docu- ments that, like the UFO itself, are here one day and gone tomorrow? I don't criticize Mr. Strieber for spend- ing his money how he will, mind, nor for wanting, like the rest of us, to find out as much as we feasibly can. I only question what we can feasibly find out, given the present climate, about the originality of any document. Com- puter analysis, remember, was sup- posed to ultimately solve the problem of whether a particular photograph was mundane (a hoax) or magnificent (proof of extraterrestrial visitation). But even its foremost adherents, including Bruce Maccabee, among others, admit its virtual, built-in limita- tions. These inherent reservations still have the upper hand in determining authenticity, as is evidenced by the Gulf Breeze case. Has there ever been a similar series of UFO sight- ings, aside from the widely-accepted- as-hoax Billy Meier episode, with so many photographs of so various orig- ins as Gulf Breeze can claim? But where is the absolute, incontrovertible proof, computerized or otherwise? In the end, one simply decides to believe Gulf Breeze or not, based on prior perceptions and experiences. Again, it goes without saying that there are still legions of followers unfurling the flag of faith in the wake of Adamski and Meier. Ultimately, the real concern is not over the presence or even absence of evidence, though that is the way it's argued on the sur- face; ultimately, the dilemma is what evidence means. Without a consen- sus agreement as to the nature of evidence itself, hbw can we hope to ever agree on what it implies or does not imply? We all search for certainty. But as Mr. Strieber's two books convincingly demonstrate, even the certainty of experience is not necessarily sufficient to convince the one who had the orig- inal experience, let alone the rest of us who must treat with such expe- riences second-hand, as best we can. Two Dubious Documents Having rambled in generalities too long already, I'll close with two recent samples of more dubious documents, the significance of which are up to the individual to assess. The first comes from a former editor of the Journal, Richard Hall, who is employed by Congressional Information Service, a private publishing concern in Bethesda, MD, and so in a position to know whereof he speaks. Partially repro- duced here as Figure 1, the document purports to be two pages from the official Congressiona/ Record for Tues- day, March 8, 1955. Hall received the document from one Miguel, last name not known to me, who is a \"Pleidean Preceptor\" in Reno, Nevada, and who in turn received it from a Lew Tery. Chances are, given the cost of a postage stamp, you may well receive a copy of same soon yourself. The trouble, of 5"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"course, is that it's an outright fake, according to Hall, who was able to immediately check his company's re- cords. First, the 78th Congress met from 1943 to 1944, and not 1955, as indicated by the \"document,\" and secondly there is no biographical record of a Senator Edward Wertham ever having served in the Senate. So who is Lew Tery, and why is he hav- ing the fictitious Senator Wertham (R. Wyo.) say all those nice things about flying saucers and the Alien Exclusion Bill, anyhow? The second document, partially reproduced as figure 2, happens to be \"authentic.\" I know, because I wrote it myself, and it came about in this way. I recently acquired a new IBM compatible computer and Hewlett- Packard Series II laser printer. Unfor- tunately, Hewlett-Packard, in its cor- porate wisdom, saw fit to produce and market what, off the shelf, consti- tutes the world's most expensive typewriter. For the kind of fancy fonts most of us associate with laser print- ing, software or hardware add-ons are required. After several weeks of being constrained by the built-in Courier, I finally acquired a Bitstream font generator, and I'm afraid my enthusi- asm got the better of me. Now armed with the sort of officious typestyles The maze of MJ-12 itself is now so overgrown with weeds and overlain with obfuscation, deliberate or simply accidental, that the majority of us will be unto eternity in figuring it out. that render the most puerile print-out in laser-sharp legality, I sat down at the keyboard. Instead of doing something serious, as I should have, I indulged in a bit of literary foreplay. The result is what, superficially at least, appears to be an official press release. Given expe- rience and a little more knowledge of what I was about, no doubt I could have doctored up the spurious press release another considerable degree or two. As it was, I was momentarily impressed enough with my efforts that I eventually churned out two pages of this sort of stuff. I was even more impressed when I ran the final product through the laser. In fact, I was so impressed, that without really thinking, I immediately ran off 20 copies and mailed them out to various correspondents, more or less helter-skelter. Had not Hall's let- ter with its Congressional \"Record\" arrived the same week, I would prob- ably still be mailing out copies and thinking myself quite the clever one. After all, I assumed anyone reading my \"press release\" would immediately cognize from its contents that it was completely a tongue-in-cheek affair. But what if each one of them sent it on in turn to 20 of their correspond- ents? Inevitably, given ufology's inces- tuous insularity, I'd be sure to receive an out-of-context copy of my own hoax, no doubt accompanied by a concerned cover letter, wondering why in Heaven's name Dan Rather hadn't picked up on the earthshaking news. Before that scenario does unfold, unlikely as it may seem, it's time to go public with a confession. It's time Lew Tery, and perhaps others, went public as well. In the meantime, don't believe everything you read. Remember: There are an awful lot of new generation computers and laser printers floating around out there somewhere. Inevita- bly someone will want to play with one. Kudos For Kenneth Ring By Harold A. Cahn, Ph.D. Dr. Cahn is a MUFON consul- tant in psychophysiology and the author of \"Speculations on the UFO Experience\" and \"Methodo- logical Postulates for Science and the Paranormal,\" articles which have appeared in various sympo- sia collections. He is presently a biomedical consultant in Phoenix, Arizona. Kenneth Ring, psychologist and MUFON consultant, surely deserves our kudos for his insightful and can- did piece on an imaginal interpreta- tion of (mostly) UFO abduction expe- riences. As little as a decade ago such 6 work would not be accepted in most literature in the field. That it is a lead article in the MUFON UFO Journal rightfully reflects earned honor for the author. Ring deserves credit because he: 1) hypothesized that UFO encounter experiences are best understood as of a reality between perceptual and fan- tasmal called imaginal, 2) proposed that ufologists manufacture folklore, and 3) identified some pertinent fea- tures of imaginal reality. I think each of these things is worth doing for ultimately humanistic reasons. Over about forty years of being an anomalist, but not ufologist per se, I observed a shift in attitude of research- ers toward all varieties of anomalous experience. In a panel discussion in an Aerial Phenomenon Research Organ- ization (APRO) UFO symposium in Tucson, Arizona, I suggested that ufologists should study the UFO experience, not the ostensible UFO phenomenon. This is required if we are to gain real insight into the huma- nistic significance of these nonpluss- ing events. Neither James nor Coral Lorenzen, hosts of the conference and well known champions of the extraterrestrial hypothesis (ETH), re- ceived my ideas with enthusiasm, but the National Enquirer (the unofficial MUFON UFO Journal, No. 255, July 1989"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"journal of folklore in the making: Ring) adopted them for their shock value. In my forthcoming book (The M/ay of Doers/iip) I propose that anomal- ous experiences of all types (including UFO visitations) are literally manufac- tured in the brain-biocomputer. Now readers find my ideas intriguing and even possibly true! Dr. Ring has an idea, so my experience tells me, whose time has come. By endorsing his effort, hopefully I encourage further explorations of the UFO experience as a basis for generating folklore.* Such mythology is a necessary ingredient for a kind of cognition which is uniquely human. Without it people are just reproducing, metabol- izing, homeostasis-maintaining reactive machines. I call it the cognition of doership. To do it one must hold mythic beliefs. This is why study of UFO encounter experiences is criti- cally important. Ring hints that ufologists labor under the delusion that they conduct scientific studies of the UFO pheno- menon when what they really do is generate content for folklore. Even dedicated debunkers like Phillip Klass unwittingly play an important role in this activity. Nowadays, to generate folklore there must be: 1) anomalous content, such as \"little people\" of var- ious cultures, enigmatic, i.e., physi- cally undetectable, energy, men in black or angelic/demonic entities, whose very existence is always pend- ing proof, 2) non-definitive, reason- placating arguments for or against the mythos under consideration, and 3) simulated scientific analysis. These requirements are admirably met by UFO research just as it was for the investigation of trance medi- ums in yesteryear. To see this, review the history of research on psionic/ra- dionic devices like Hieronymus mach- ines or orgone boxes. Such investiga- tions resolve no questions and, curious- ly enough to the uninitiated, employ subtle dodges to avoid serious testing * The major myths, religious dogmas beyond mere ethical systems, fairy tales and local folk- lore are generic examples of mythoses. My view is that they are essential for manufactur- ing experience other than that required just to react adaptively to stimuli. As far as I can tell such cognition is uniquely human. MUFON UFO Journal, No. 255, July 1989 when it is actually possible to do so. In this context consider the loss of photographs and other documenta- tion, or misplacement of physical trace materials, which so often plague these researches. Mainline scientists are frustrated by the simulation of scientific methodology by ufologists, parapsychologists and even thanatol- ogists, without recognizing that these people perhaps unknowingly do exact- ly what they intend to do: generate and maintain the mystique of their particular brand of folklore in the making. Losers in this game are naive scientists like myself who, for years, unsuccessfully combed the literature for hard evidence of even the exist- ence of anomalous phenomena. For pointing this out to UFO aficionados such as readers of the MUFON UFO Journal, Ring is to'be congratulated. As a mythic taxonomist Ring found certain invariant characteristics of UFO abduction and other anomalous visitation experiences. These include: 1) stereotypy of abduction accounts, 2) features of some encounters that \"invade\" perceptual reality, and 3) UFO experiences, as well as others, that are neither objective perceptions nor pure fantasies, but partake of an alternate reality which he (after Henry Corbin) calls imaginal. I found the same characteristics prevalent in other genera of anomalous experience (from extrasensory perception to \"miracu- lous\" curing) and concluded that the same psychophysiological mechanisms are involved in their manufacture in the brain-biocomputer. The intended point is well taken: anomalous experience is experientially real and must be taken seriously. I argued so in 1972 in a Psychical Research Foundation (founded by that extraordinary trance medium Eileen Garrett) symposium on science and psi phenomena. Some partici- pants understood why I suggested a change in thrust of psychical research from the nature of paranormal phen- omena \"out there\" in an ostensible independently existing reality called the physical world to inquiries into the psychophysiology of psychic exper- iencing \"in here.\" I gradually came to understand, as I think does Ring, that by demonstrating how we, as expe- rients, generate precognitions or other types of anomalous experience, we can better understand how human beings, perhaps uniquely, create doer- ship in contrast to mechanical reac- torship. This is the real purpose of investigating UFO mythology in pro- gress. To paraphrase a (probably apocry- phal) dictum of physicist Freeman Dyson, Ring's ideas may be crazy but we wonder if they are crazy enough to meet the requirements of the awe- some task of elucidating the mecha- nism of generation of anomalous experience. I personally do not think so. It becomes incumbent on me to justify this point by showing how Ring's approach can be improved to be more fruitful for analyzing anomal- ous experience — the ultimate crea- tion process. The crippling fundamental error made by almost all investigators is to presume, quite without proof, that experience, anomalous or ordinary, is of some independently existing reality. Under this assumption Ring was led to the unfruitful conclusion that imag- inal reality is another domain, not under natural law, whose ontological status is equivalent to that of both perceptual and fantasmal reality. This is true if by realm is meant mode of experiencing. But if not, we are left with the aching question of whether UFOs, for example, are as real as automobiles or the IRS. I wrestled with this problem for years before deciding to adopt the belief that expe- rience is not of any independently existing reality, but that it is manufac- tured in the brain-biocomputer in what I now call the creation process. No wonder Ring's three realities (per- ceptual, imaginal and fantasmal) are ontologically equal: they are all pro- ducts of the same (and only) creation process! By adopting this belief, which also can't be proved, we can shed the lim- itations of the conventional approach to: 1) one-pointedly pursue the psy- chophysiology of the creation pro- cess, 2) create a tool I call waking introspection for doing this, and 3) recognize that the notion that the scientific method is a superior way to obtain knowledge of the nature of Continued on page 9"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"ET or MT? A Response To Kenneth Ring White is a well known author, editor and agent in several areas of what might be called \"New Age\" concerns. Kenneth Ring says the extraterres- trial hypothesis (ETH) is absurd and must be rejected (\"Toward an Imagi- nal Interpretation of 'UFO Abductions' ,\" MUFON Journal, May 1989). In- stead, he urges the ufological research community to adopt a view based on the imaginal realm — a term roughly synonymous with metaphysical and with J. Allen Hynek's coinage, meta- terrestrial (MT). Ring's presentation of the imaginal realm and the bridge he and his colleagues are building from folklore and mythology to ufol- ogy is most welcome. His perspective on the UFO experience is refreshing because he offers the possibility of deepening our theoretical understand- ing. But it is also, I regret to say, somewhat flawed because it contains an example of the simplistic reduc- tionism which Ring himself deplores. There is no need to throw out the ETH. It stands as the foremost con- tender for explaining a good many UFO cases — but not all. Some cases have details and aspects, sum- marized by Ring, which defy explana- tion in ET terms, as conventionally conceived. (Jacques Vallee and John Keel make similar critiques in their recent books, respectively, Dimen- sions and Disneyland of the Cods.) Well and good. However, there is a problem: theoreticians, including Ring, want a single, unifying explanation for all UFO cases when there may be none. In my view, the UFO expe- rience consists of several discrete phenomena, each of which has a clear, consistent explanation for a certain body of cases, but which can- not and should not be stretched to 8 By John White try to explain every case. \"Critters\" For example, Trevor James Con- stable presents a plausible, coherent case for what he calls \"critters\" or space animals. An article of mine forthcoming in UFO summarizes it, proposing that Constable's research can explain many well-observed UFO cases. However, I point out — as does Constable — that many other cases are not explicable in terms of critters, and some of those cases may involve ET spacecraft. What is needed in the UFO research community is greater discrimination of the data and a willingness to rec- ognize multiple solutions. Ring's imag- inal interpretation, which I feel is an important step toward greater under- standing of the situation, nevertheless seems to throw out the baby with the bathwater. The imaginal realm — recognized by many traditions, such as shama- nism, esoteric psychology, sacred tra- ditions, foklore and mythology, and psychical research — is said to be ontologically real, with inhabitants capable of penetrating into the 3-D space-time framework we call the physical world. Conversely, we humans are capa- ble of penetrating the membrane of physical reality and entering the imag- inal world. Thus far in human history, the means of \"crossing the bar\" have been psychological, involving manipu- lation of states of consciousness. But it is not inconceivable that such transworld passages might be effected by technological means. \"Beam me up, Scotty\" and \"Warp speed, Mr. Sulu?\" become more feasible daily, and judging by some reports of com- petent researchers — which I've gathered in my Psychic Warfare — Fact or Fiction? (Aquarian Press, 1988; distributed in the U.S. by Ste- rling Publishing Co., New York) — advanced military research by the Soviet Union may have a handle on hyperspace already. Project such a capability a mere 200 years into the human future, comparable to the difference between human technology in 1789 and today. What would be we capable of in 2189? It staggers the imagination. Now attribute such a capability to an extraterrestrial species advanced be- yond us by thousands of years and — voila! — all the characteristics of the imaginal world become technologically accessible and reproducible. Logically speaking, space travel implies hypers- pace travel because astrophysical dis- tances seem too great even for beings whose lifespans are naturally or artifi- cally extended far beyond a human's. So it may be that extraterrestrials — in the physical, flesh-and-blood sense — are involved in UFO abduc- tions, operating from the physical realm via the imaginal/astral/hyper- space realm. And their unwillingness to give us proof of their presence can be understood in part by James Deardorffs presentation of the extra- terrestrial embargo hypothesis. However, following the logic of my own argument, I must acknowledge that metaterrestrials or denizens of the imaginal realm may also be involved in UFO abductions. Again, it's not an either-or situation. It could be both-and. Yet even here, I must disagree with Ring on one point. He would have us believe that MT abductions, expe- rienced as physically real, actually occur in the imaginal realm. Well, yes and no. If we humans can go to the imaginal, the imaginal can also come MUFON UFO Journal, No. 255, July 1989"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"to us. Why is it any more sensible to say that everything occurs in the imaginal than everything occurs in the physical? Again, it may not be a sim- ple either-or situation. Physical effects may have physical causes as well as imaginal ones. I'll be the first to grant that many of the experiences reported by abductees have precisely the dream- like qualities which are characteristic of the imaginal realm and which, logi- cally speaking, most likely occurred there. But that doesn't rule out physi- cal experience or physical causes. For example, many abductees report that at the outset of the experience, their abductors shone a beam of light at them from a hand-held device or from a craft. I refer to such technol- ogy as a \"kundalini gun\" because the reported effects of being zapped with the lightbeam include many of the classic psychophysiological effects re- ported by people undergoing the spir- itual phenomenon known as \"awaken- ing the kundalini.\" Fairy Wand I won't go into detail about kunda- lini here; readers are referred to my Kundalini, Evolution and Enlighten- ment (Doubleday, 1979; to be reprinted in 1990 by Paragon House, New York.) My point is: abductees report being physically encountered and phy- sically immobilized by the lightbeam — akin in folklore to being touched by a \"fairy wand\" — which overpow- ers their nervous system and renders it utterly under control by the abduc- tors. At that point, I conjecture, the imaginal aspect becomes predominant because the abductors eject the abduc- tee's astral or imaginal body from the physical by technical means and then proceed with the usual puzzling, sometimes bizarre effects which abduc- tees report, including missing time. That excursion into the imaginal realm would not rule out the possibil- ity of the abductors taking skin sam- ples, inserting needles, implanting BB- like djevices, etc., while in the physical realm. In fact, Whitley Strieber told me recently that he now has four cases in which brain-implanted devi- ces have been verified by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Such MRI MUFON UFO Journal, No. 255, July 1989 Just as the skeptics of paranormal phenomena try to reduce all mind to matter, UFO researchers must be careful not to commit the same error in reverse by reducing all matter to mind. scans would be good evidence of a physical dimension to UFO abduc- tions, but would not invalidate Ring's case if he would modify it to a softer \"both-and\" from his hard \"either-or\" stance. The thrust of UFO research is into the metaphysical or the metaterres- trial. But just as the skeptics of paranormal phenomena try to reduce all mind to matter, UFO researchers must be careful not to commit the same error in reverse by reducing all matter to mind. Ring has done just that, to the detriment of an otherwise excellent presentation which legitim- izes paranormal phenomena, includ- ing ufology, to the psychological com- munity. I hope to see the \"strong\" form of his hypothesis revised to a \"weak\" one which would, in my judgment, strengthen it and save it from over- simplifying the complex. Those abduc- tors may be ETs, presenting them- selves in a manner which allows both the literal and the imaginal aspects to operate. And, to indicate even more emphat- ically the complexity of the situation, there may be more than one species of ET, which is what many contactees report being told by their purported contacts. Judging from David Webb and Ted Bloecher's humanoid catalog, Earth may be one of the major cross- roads of local space. Different ETs could have different technologies, agen- das, missions, motivations, values sys- tems, etc., just as denizens of the imaginal realm may range from fairies, ghosts and astral tricksters to dakinis, devas and archangels. If reality is multileveled, we must give each level its due in seeking to explain phenomena. In physics, both Newtonian and quantum theories serve a purpose. In psychology, both behav- iorism and freudian theory legitimately operate within the larger perspective of transpersonal psychology. Let us not prematurely rule out the possibil- ity of multiple explanations, each of which authentically solves part but not all of the UFO puzzle. KUDOS, continued reality is as much of a mythos as is, for example, the notion of revelation from God. To do this became my vocation* In closing, let me recommend that we consider all experience, especially anomalous experience, in the con- structivistic framework that it is manufactured independently of any reality \"out there\" so we can get on with the more important task of ana- lyzing the psychophysiology of ex- perience-making, instead of quibbling about the reality of UFO encounters, ghosts or the lost land of Atlantis. Toward accomplishing this Ring has made a giant step. * Vocation is that which one does in contrast to mechanical reactions. In my sunset years my activity is directed to analysis of the neuropsy- chophysiology of manufacturing anomalous experience and studying how this is related to doership. That is really what my book is about. Lawrence Fawcett and Barry J. Greenwood INTENT THE GOVERNMENTCOVERUP OF THE UFO EXPERIENCE What does the government know about UFOs and why won't it tell us?

Ratsch, MUFON member in Dundalk, Maryland has been moni- toring the radio broadcasts from the space shuttle Discovery through WA3NAN, the club station of the Goddard Amateur Radio Club at Greenbelt, MD, transmitting on 147.450 MHZ. At 6:35 a.m. EST on March 14, 1989, he heard this statement, \"we have a problem — we have a fire.\" (This might have been the first clue to the resultant electrical problem that was subsequently repaired.) The most interesting transmission occurred seven minutes later at 6:42 a.m. EST, when one of the astronauts purportedly made this transmission: \"Houston (from) Discovery, we still have the alien spacecraft under obser- vance.\" Don Ratsch immediately called Walt Andrus and played the tape recording over the telephone. (The above was published in the April 1989 issue number 252 of the MUFON UFO Journal.) With the original tape recording in hand, Vincent DiPretro, Robert L. Oechsler and others launched an investigation into the authenticity of the voice recording, since it could be of very significant importance, if true. This was potential evidence that our astronauts may have sighted and con- firmed the presence of alien space- craft over an extended period of time during this flight. The readers of the Journal were promised a follow-up after the original \"News Release\" was published in April. The importance of such a possibility for UFO research was the motivation to spur many of our MUFON people to respond imme- diately.

Bunda L. Dean, FOIA Coordinator, Public Services Branch, Office of Pub- lic Affairs, NASA, Lyndon B.

The moment that the news broke concerning this sensitive trans- mission, James E. Oberg, now employ- ed by Rockwell at the Space Center, was making telephone and personal contacts seeking information from knowledgeable people. The probing direction of his questions implied that he was looking for logical alternatives, so he could prepare a statement explaining away the event. Was the NASA response above the conclusion reached after his inquiry? (Mr. Oberg has been a subscriber to the MUFON Journal since 1976). Robert L. \"Bob\" Oechsler, State Section Director in Maryland, con- ducts a UFO radio program each Sunday evening on a Baltimore, MD radio station. He made arrangements to interview John Blaha, the pilot of Discovery, by telephone, immediately after the Press Conference concluded in Houston, for his upcoming Sunday evening program.

Mr. Blaha readily discussed the various radio communication channels available aboard Discovery and their uses. When Bob shrewdly turned the interview around to ask the \"dynamite questions\" on the \"alien spacecraft,\" the tone of John Blaha's responses changed to one of belligerence. Blaha denied any knowledge of the transmission \"we have a fire,\" although they did have a power loss 90 min- utes into the mission. He emphatically denied that he made the statement concerning the \"alien spacecraft\" or \"we have a fire\" and claimed to have no personal knowledge of these trans- missions. The long and informative interview was terminated very shortly thereafter, when Mr. Blaha apparently realized that he had been cleverly \"put-on-the-spot.\" Philip Mantle, MUFON Representa- tive for England, became very intrigued with the Discovery communications when it was published in newspapers and tabloids in the United Kingdom immediately after the news broke in UFO circles. To my knowledge only the Weekly World News (May 2, 1989) published the event in the 12 U.S.A. and they quoted the Daily Star in London, England as their source. In its usual outrageous fashion the Weekly World News embellished the story until it became pure fiction. In order to delve into the story deeper, Mr. Mantle wrote a letter to Michael L. Coats, Commander STS- 29 (Discovery), quoting the news story published in England, and ques- tioning its authenticity. He received a reply from Mr. Coats (NASA Hous- ton stationery) dated May 30, 1989 stating the following: \"Thank you for your letter. Believe me, you cannot believe everything you read in maga- zines or newspapers.

They are manufactured to sell magazines and newspapers. \"I have read several stories about how we used the 'code word FIRE' to mean aliens. We never used the word 'fire' at all — 'fire' means fire, which is much more alarming than aliens ever would be. If we did see any aliens, the whole world hear about it imme- diately. We are just as curious about the possibility of other life as anyone, so why would we try to be secretive? \"Again, you will never hear an actual recording of us mentioning 'aliens,' or 'fire' or whatever, because we never did. However we did have two U.S. Marines on the crew; per- haps that caused the confusion.\" Signed: Michael L. Coats, Commander STS-29. Voice Analysis As we mentioned in the April 1989 Journal, voiceprint analysis was being arranged and started on the \"alien spacecraft\" tape. Bob Oechsler con- tacted Vincent DiPietro in Glendale, MD who in turn contracted with a professional firm — Voice Identifica- tion, Inc. (VII) in Somerville, NJ to perform the analysis. In addition to the long tape recorded interview of John Blaha by Bob Oechsler, copies of TV interviews with each of the astronauts (audio tapes) were pro- vided to VII for comparison purposes to the voice on the \"target tape.\" A follow-up report would not be com- plete without the status of the voice- print analysis performed by VII. In the report letter to Mr. Vincent DiPietro, dated April 19, 1989,1 am quoting: \"At your request we have begun an analysis of a recording you sent us identified as Target tape — Event 3- 14-89.' You have asked me to do a voiceprint analysis in which we com- pare the voice on this tape with known voice samples of five shuttle crewmen. The known samples are contained on two tape recordings identified as 'Control tape interview by NBC 3-17-89' and 'Shuttle Crew STS29.' \"A voiceprint analysis is comprised of an aural (listening) portion and spectographic portion. In order to arrive at a decision that carries the highest degree of certainty, we need to have twenty or more words that are common to each recording and whose spectrograms show distinct similarities for an identification or dis- tinct differences for an elimination. In addition, the aural examination should support the spectographic analysis.

Dr. Bagian's sam- ples yielded three or four words that showed some limited similarities to the questioned voice, but even this may be due to coincidence.

Alexanderson President After reading the letter on the voiceprint analysis from Voice Identi- fication, Inc. (VII) to Vincent DePie- tro, it is readily apparent that there is insufficient evidence to link one of the five crew members of Discovery to the \"alien spacecraft\" tape. Had we been able to do so, plans were already formulated between the Fund for UFO Research and the Mutual UFO Network to issue a press release announcing this incredible news. On the other hand, gifts and dona- tions to the Fund for UFO Research financed the professional analysis per- formed by VII, for which we are indebted. Both MUFON and FUFOR are prepared to financially support significant research projects in the future. If new evidence is forthcoming on the Discovery tape, the analysis will be resumed and expanded. On the positive side, this is a terrific example of how UFO researchers can unite and work as a team to solve a problem. Two Florida Reports By Carol and Rex Salisberry Both Salisberrys are MUFON research specialists and field inves- tigators. CHRONOLOGICAL NARRATIVE: 0338 am, 8 Feb. 1989. Jeff Thompson was awakened by his dogs (adult female white labrador and her pup) barking in the attached garage of his home on Standford Road, Gulf Breeze, Florida. The adult dog had a frantic tone to her bark and was scratching on the door between the garage and the house which Jeff termed as unus- ual for her. He let the dogs into the house, although he normally would have let them out of the other door from the garage into the fenced back yard. Jeff at first thought that they were barking at a prowler but then noticed the dog was \"hyper\" and acted differently than when someone might walk by the house. The dog went to the front door to be let out which indicated to Jeff that whatever had aroused her was in front of the house. MUFON UFO Journal, No. 255, July 1989 When he opened the door, the dog exited and moved a few feet to the right, still barking. Jeff watched the dog and then looked up to see a small object, bathed in a dim white light, which was descending to a land- ing about 60 feet away in a vacant lot. (The distance was later measured to be 82 feet.) Jeff felt that the dog knew exactly where the object was although it probably could not have seen it out of the two small windows in the gar- age door. Jeff called the dog back into the house and shouted for his family to get up to see the object at 0340 am. Jeff had difficulty in rousing Tammy, but his son Miguel awoke immediately and went to look out of the front door, where he could see the lighted object on the ground between two small trees. He noted that the object now displayed green \"point\" lights as well as the main white light. He also noted that six or seven other dogs in the neighborhood were also barking. Jeff said that he had wanted to have Tammy see the object (as con- firmation) since the other time that he had reported the sighting of a UFO he had not felt that he had been believed. This time he insisted that Tammy get up and come to the door to witness the sighting, which she did. She reports seeing a glowing-white light close to the ground which looked strange to her and mused that it might be a UFO. She watched for a very short period of time (a minute or so) and then went back to bed since she was getting cold. Jeff wanted Miguel to get a better look at the object, so he lifted him up to shoulder height while they were standing a few feet to the right of their front door. At this point the object, which had appeared to have only static white and green lights before, lighted up with numerous other lights of white, two shades of green and reddish/orange colors. They blinked very rapidly in what appeared to Jeff to be a programmed pattern. Jeff then went back into the house 13"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"with Miguel to dress and get a flash- light. While dressing Jeff told Tammy that \"he was going out to bring the object into the house.\" Jeff took the flashlight and went back outside after instructing Miguel to lock the door and to remain inside with the dog. Miguel and the dog then watched from the front room window as Jeff proceeded along a sort of wide path across the vacant lot nearest his house. He walked a sort of arcing path to the right toward the object and shined the flashlight around the area to check for any other strange \"things\" that might be around. He related that he \"sensed\" that there might be other objects on the ground as well as in the air in that immediate vicinity. He stopped at the south edge of a wide ditch which separates the two vacant lots and then directed the beam of the flashlight toward the object on the ground about 25-30 feet away (it was later measured to be 34 feet). Jeff then heard a \"sizzling\" noise from the direction of the object. He dropped to his knees and slipped slightly down the slope of the side of the ditch. He observed the white light to brighten then disappear. Miguel watched the above from his window vantage point. All of the time that Jeff proceeded toward the object the blinking and changing of the colors of the lights continued at a rapid rate. When Jeff shined the flashlight on the object, Miguel saw the white dome light turn to bright, then dim and then back to solid bright followed by a brilliant white flash which appeared to move about \"an inch to the left\" and then disappeared. (Miguej later clarified that the inch movement would be as if at arms length which would mean that the object would have moved about 30 inches to the left.) He stated that he had a \"blueshadow\" in his vision for several seconds after the flash. Jeff searched the area with the flashlight where the object had been resting, and finding nothing, he return- ed to the house at 0352 am. The barking of the dogs in the neighbor- hood ceased at the same time. Tammy and Miguel went back to sleep in about a half hour, but Jeff stayed awake for the remainder of the night 14 and only went back to sleep after the children had departed for school. None of the three could recall any unusual sleep patterns prior to the incident that night; bedtime at the usual hour, etc. Miguel is 12 years of age. Detailed Description When Jeff first saw the object des- cending it appeared as a dim white glow, although he could see the out- line of two disc-like structures with the smaller above the larger. Its height when first seen was about two- thirds the height of the telephone pole (about 20-25 feet). It was descending slowly on a straight path which made about a 75-degree angle with the ground. Jeff saw no oscillation or motion from the straight line path. The vertical axis of the object was along the flight path such that it would need to make a 15-degree \"nose over\" to come to a level land- ing on the ground. Both Jeff and Miguel were unsure whether the object actually touched the ground or not. When a reenactment of shining the flashlight on the object was made, Jeff indicated that it would have been hovering about three inches above the ground. This estimation also showed the object to have been about 20 inches tall. Jeff was amazed at the straight path and steady slow des- cending flight of the object since the wind was blowing very hard. On the approach path described by Jeff, power lines and tree obstructions on any descent angle were much less than about 75 degrees. A detailed drawing will be provided later as there was insufficient time to take all of the necessary measurements during the first two visits. Jeff describes the object as having about a three-foot diameter on the lower disc and a ten inch diameter on the upper one. The discs appeared to be about eight inches apart and con- nected by a dull colored structure which was unlighted. Miguel could not see the connecting structure which was visible to Jeff when he approached to a closer range. A clear dome was on top of the upper disc. Neither Jeff nor Miguel could provide estimates of the dome nor the thickness of the discs. Based on the drawings pro- vided by Miguel and Jeff it appears that the upper disc might have a thickness of about four inches and the lower one about eight inches. Miguel's drawing shows the lower disc to be about a foot thick but his view was from an elevated position causing him to be looking partially down upon the object. The clear dome appears from the drawings to be a hemisphere of about four inches in diameter. Jeff stated that the object glowed predominantly a dim white prior to landing. After landing, green, white and reddish/orange \"point\" lights then appeared. The clear dome on top alternately changed from a bright to dim white light. Jeff noticed that each time that the light in the dome changed to bright a \"black piece\" within the dome seemed to move with a twisting movement from the upper left to the lower right. This was not apparent when the light changed to dim. None of the lights seemed to have a directed beam nature (like a flashlight) nor were the ground or other objects, such as trees, illumi- nated by the lights. At about the time that Jeff lifted Miguel for a better view, the colored lights started changing very rapidly on both the upper and lower discs. There were up to eight lights on the upper disc which would change rapidly from white to green and green to white, with no apparent pattern of repetition. At first a block of lights would change together but later indi- vidual lights would change independ- ently. There appeared to be 15 or more lights on the lower disc (under- standably the lights on the far side of the disc would be blocked from view). Two of these were reddish/orange and blinked on and off but did not change color. The others on the lower disc would change rapidly from light to dark to light green with an occasional change to white. Jeff believes the changing of the lights was a pre- programmed pattern which would have continued had he not interfered by shining the flashlight at the object. Jeff relates that his intention was to capture the object and to bring it into the house. While he was approaching it, he sensed the presence of other \"things\" in the area, both on the MUFON UFO Journal, No. 255, July 1989"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"ground and in the air. He continually scanned the ground with the flashlight and the sky but saw nothing else. Although the street light directly across the street from the landing site was missing, some illumination was provided by a street light farther to the south and from a light on the side of a house across the street. AREAS FOR FURTHER INVES- TIGATION: More loose ends need to be tied up on this sighting. A neigh- borhood check was completed and no other witnesses were found. Jeff related that sometime during the winter of 1986-87 he was driving a truck south toward West Palm Beach when he seemed to have lost from an hour to an hour and a half of time. This was also evidenced by his recol- lection of driving the same mile and a half stretch of road twice. Jeff also relates to having episodes of profuse sweating and agitation dur- ing his sleep. On one occasion around Halloween time 1988 he awoke in a sweat with a deep sense of fear in the bedroom where he and Tammy were sleeping. He saw two or three \"people-like\" apparitions which had a look like the \"vapor one can see coming off of gasoline.\" He awoke Tammy who could see nothing, but both heard the clanking of coins in a change bucket on the floor as if someone had kicked it. Jeff indicated that he had had similar experiences while living in his parents' home in Cincinnati, Ohio between the years 1957-1975. His son Miguel seems to be having similar experien- ces now when visiting in the grand- parental home and sleeping in the same room occupied earlier by his father. Tammy recalls that during the Halloween incident Jeff was terrified and spoke of lights flashing. Jeff has a scar on his right hand and has no recollection as to the cir- cumstances of the wound. Miguel claims to have had an approximate six-inch shallow cut on his right shin that he has no recollection of receiving. Miguel claims to have had two dreams involving UFOs or aliens. The first was before his father's appear- ence on TV last year. He dreamed of standing on the ground and observing two UFOs on the ground before him. One seemed larger than \"two houses MUFON UFO Journal, No. 255, July 1989 put together\" and the second was much smaller. The larger one appeared to have a domed city on its top. The two UFOs rose slowly off the ground and then moved away at high speed. His second dream was the night after his father's appearance on TV. This dream was similar to some of the stories related during the TV program, being examined by aliens, etc. Summation No contradictions have emerged so far in the investigation to indicate a hoax. Although it is probable that Jeff and Miguel have discussed the hap- pening between themselves, informa- tion taken from them individually indicates good correlation. Variances in their accounts are attributable to their geographically different viewing locations, e.g. Miguell could not see the connecting structure between two discs which was visible to Jeff, and Miguel could see more lights on the lower disc than Jeff. It is indeterminate whether Jeff was awakened by his dogs' barking or by an outside influence. He believes the former. It is also indeterminate as to what aroused the dogs in the first place. Did they see the UFO maneuvering outside of the small windows in the garage door, did they hear some high frequency sound emanating from the object, or \"what\"? The geographic layout of the area permits the events to have happened as Jeff describes them. For example, had he described a shallower approach angle the object could probably not have missed hitting the power lines or pole. To have landed a three-foot diameter object in that confined area would have required a precise gui- dance system either self-contained or provided by an external source. This is particularly true in consideration of the high wind velocities that night. The possibility of time loss should be investigated more fully. If Jeff's account is correct, something moved him and his truck backwards at least a mile and a half over the route that he had already passed. Jeffs dreams and other experiences with \"entities\" in his room should also be investi- gated more fully. Miguel's dreams don't seem to have much significance in themselves, but should be investigated more fully along with his experiences in the Cin- cinnati house. Interview notes of two investigators involved in this case are available to whomever might conduct any contin- uing investigation. NOTE: Jeff is scheduled to enter the West Florida Regional Hospital on Monday 13 February for back surgery. The length of his stay in the hospital is indefinite. PENSACOLA REPORT The witnesses to this case wish to remain anonymous. Their full names and addresses are indicated on Form One which should be removed if this report is reproduced for wider dis- semination. They shall be referred to here by the pseudonyms of Maxie and Jane. Maxie had attended a UFO work- shop which was conducted by Mr. Donald Ware (MUFON State Direc- tor for Florida) in Gulf Breeze, FL on 29 April 1989. After the workshop Maxie spoke to Mr. Ware about a UFO sighting which she had heard about. He referred her to the Gulf Breeze Chamber of Commerce Fair (held the same day) where Pensacola MUFON had a booth. Maxie con- tacted the investigators at the booth who were subsequently assigned to the case by Mr. Charles Flannigan, Pensacola MUFON Director. It is interesting that the event which Maxie had related to Mr. Ware occurred seven years ago to another person, but in the process of investigation several other events, including this one, surfaced. An appointment was made to meet with Maxie in her home on 3 May 1989. Sighting Maxie's Account. Maxie and Jane were driving home to the Interarity Point area of Pensacola on the night of 8 March 1989 at about 10:30 pm CST. Maxie was driving, with Jane in the passenger side of the front seat. Shortly after they passed the intersec- tion of Blue Angel Parkway, while 15"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"driving west on New Gulf Beach Highway, they saw a bright white light back in the trees to the left side of the road. At first Maxie thought that it might be a helicopter with a search light but she could hear no sound from it. The light appeared to be in among the trees or to their side, so that trees were between the object and the ladies. It seemed to follow along with them at the same speed as they drove along. Their view of it varied as the density of the trees varied. As they approached a turn right past the cement plant, they lost sight of it. As they rounded the turn they could see it hovering over the road ahead of them as if waiting. Maxie stopped the car and both ladies got out for a better view. Maxie instinc- tively started toward it but was blocked by the open car door. She could see that it was an oval-shaped object which was about 18-20 feet across and about ten feet high. It had a red blinking light on the top, two rows of flashing red, yellow and green lights in two parallel bands around the center, and a bright white light across the whole bottom. The two rows of lights also appeared to be flashing in a random sequence which appeared like they were rotating. Maxie estimated that the object was about 100 yards ahead of them and about house height above the road. The white light from the bottom reflected onto the road and adjacent grass areas. They watched it for about one minute until Maxie's hus- band, who was following in a separate car, caught up with them and stopped. At that point the object went straight up and vanished. No sound, odor or vibration was noticed to be coming from the object. Maxie's husband claimed that he had not seen the UFO although it was difficult for her to understand how he could have missed it. They all then got back into their respective cars and started on home. About two miles further on, Maxie again saw the object for a few seconds to the left side of the road. She stopped the car, but the object departed straight up \"super fast\" and disappeared. The ladies discussed the event on the rest of the drive home but not much thereafter between the 16 time of the sighting and the time of the interview. Maxie's health has remained unchanged during and after the sighting. Jane's Account Jane was riding home with Maxie in her car at about 10:30 pm CST on 8 March 1989. They were driving west on New Gulf Beach Highway and Maxie's husband was following in a second car. Just after they passed the intersection with Blue Angel Parkway, both ladies noticed a bright white light through the trees to the left side of the road. Jane could not make an estimate of the distance from them or the altitude of the light, although she felt that it was higher than the trees. It seemed to follow along with them at the same speed and led them by about 200 feet. Jane described the light as the whi- test that she had ever seen and it had a bluish tinge to it. \"It was almost binding.\" She also noted two rows of colored lights above the white light which was in the bottom. The two rows of yellow and green lights were about two feet apart and seemed to be rotating in a clockwise direction. She did not believe that the object was rotating or that the lights were changing color in a prescribed pattern resembling motion. She was not sure but she believed both rings of lights were rotating in the same clockwise direction and at the same rate. Both ladies lost sight of the object for a few seconds but as they rounded the curve just past the cement plant, they saw it again hover- ing over the road ahead of them. Jane described it as \"sitthere as if waiting for them.\" Maxie stopped the car and both ladies got out for a bet- ter view. Jane could not estimate the distance from their location to the object. She describes the object as being almost round but slightly flat- tened on the top and the bottom. She ting believed it to be about two to three times the width of the road in diameter and slightly less in height. It hovered over the road about 25-30 feet above the surface. The white light seemed to glow for about ten feet below the object but did not illuminate the ground or surrounding trees. She heard no sound nor felt any heat or vibration from it. They watched the object in fascina- tion for about a minute when it moved to their left slightly, started toward them and suddenly disap- peared. Maxie's husband had caught up to them by this time but claimed that he had not seen the object. Jane could not understand how this could be possible and thought that he may have just not wanted to admit to see- ing it. Investigation ACTIVITY LOG: The investigators had made an appointment with Maxie to meet in her home on 3 May with two other witnesses of a different case and learned of this sighting in the process. The information on all of Maxie's sightings was taken from a single Form One. A second appoint- ment was made with Maxie and Jane to interview Jane in person and to visit the scene where the sighting took place. Because of an emergency, Jane had to leave before being inter- viewed, so the bulk of her information was obtained by telephone. Both ladies have been contacted several times since by telephone. NATURAL PHENOMENA CHECK: It has been difficult to obtain an offi- cial weather report for that date so far in the past. Weather does not seem to be a significant factor in this sighting anyhow. Both ladies reported that the night was free of precipitation and there was no low cloudiness. MAN-MADE OBJECT CHECK: Navy Operations was contacted on 14 May but declined to research the informa- tion on local flying activity for the time in question. The official who was contacted made a considerable effort to explain the sighting as a helicopter flight which would routinely traverse that area. He rapidly changed the subject when asked to explain why there was no sound associated with the sighting if it had been a helicopter. THE INTERVIEWS: Maxie is a housewife who is not employed out- side of the home. She has a high school education plus other courses and workshops which she has taken over the years. She has done a lot of reading on UFO phenomena and has MUFON UFO Journal, No. 255, July 1989 /\"T"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"seen the TV coverage of the Gulf Breeze happenings and some of the network presentations on UFOs. Maxie desires anonymity because both she and her husband fear that he might lose his job if their names are made public. Maxie seems to be an honest, believable person, although perhaps somewhat susceptible to sug- gestion. She would eagerly accept future contact with UFOs and \"alien beings.\" She continues to see noctur- nal lights with the latest sighting on 1 June. Jane was previously married and is now living alone nearby to Maxie's home. She is 31 years old and works as a Receptionist at a Medical Center. Her father was a career airline pilot, who, with his first-officer, had com- piled a large book of UFO sightings which they and others had expe- rienced. She is unsure of the disposi- tion of the book since her father's death but has been encouraged to try to locate it. If successful she has ten- tatively agreed to share the contents with the MUFON investigators. She also relates of having a three hour period of missing time which hap- pened about seven years ago. It occurred at about mid-day at a shop- ping center. Her shoes, new and of good quality, looked worn out after- ward. They were scuffed and scratched on the tops which seemed strange to her. Jane has done some reading of Ruth Montgomery and similar authors. She expresses an eagerness to have closer contact with UFOs and \"aliens.\" Her health has remained good before, during and after the sighting. Evaluation Unknown, significant CE-1. The investigators drove to the scene of this sighting with Maxie and found the terrain details as they were described by both witnesses. Maxie located the spot where she had stopped her car and the investigators paced off the distance to where she believed the UFO had been hovering over the road. The distance was about 165 yards. There are minor discrepancies between the two accounts which can be attributed to observational differ- ences. Maxie thought the object to be down in the trees at almost car top MUFON UFO Journal, No. 255, July 1989 height as it paced them along the road, while Jane perceived it to be higher above the trees. Both agreed that it hovered about 25-30 feet above the road, but Jane saw it to be about twice as wide as Maxie's estimate. Maxie saw the brilliant white light as illuminating the roadway while Jane believed that the light shone only about ten feet below the object. Jane observed the object to move toward them before it vanished, whereas Maxie saw it depart straight up. The similarities of the two descriptions are compelling and supportive of each other. There has been considerable UFO activity in the area of this sighting in late April and throughout May. On 26 April at 12:15 am, a male witness experienced static on his car FM radio and the headlights went out within 200 yards of the spot where the UFO hovered over the road. He has since reported seeing three or four other cars which were stalled in the same location. On 1 May at 8:45 pm, a 70-year-old lady saw a bright white light in her backyard which was less than 20 feet from where she was standing in her kitchen. On 15 May at 8:50 pm, an anonymous witness report- ed seeing a large white light moving from east to west about 200 yards to the north of Old Gulf Beach Highway in the vicinity of the Coast Guard Station. It was about 200 feet in the air. When two aircraft started circling the area the light disappeared. Maxie continues to have frequent sightings of distant lights which seem to her to be UFOs. Her latest sighting on 1 June was also witnessed by her husband and a third person. The investigators will maintain contact with Maxie to follow up on any additional significant happenings. Jane has had an extremely hectic time of late and has not been able to complete her Form One or schedule additional interviews. The investiga- tors will maintain contact with her in efforts to learn more of her missing time episode and other indications of possible \"alien\" contact. It is also hoped that her father's lost scrap book can be located. MUFON MUFON NC Meeting Over 30 investigators and research- ers of the worldwide Mutual UFO Network, Inc. (MUFON) met in Lin- colnton, NC Sunday to celebrate the 42nd anniversary of UFOs and their occupants (UFOnauts), which occurs on June 24. It was on this day in 1947 when the UFO began with the sight- ing of nine unknown flying objects by private pilot Kenneth Arnold over Mount Rainier in Washington State. Many UFO exhibits were on hand with displays of a North Carolina map with over 829 pins on it — indicating UFO sightings in the Tar Heel State for the past 50 years compiled by Field Investigator Danny Barger of Lincolnton. UFO photographs, clippings, sketch- es, and architectural drawings of a UFO Museum, a tourist attraction proposal, and a research center by investigator George D. Fawcett of Lincolnton were also on display. A large number of books, publica- tions and video films were on display to buy, sell or trade for members and guests of the North Carolina unit of the Mutual UFO Network, interna- tional headquarters, Seguin, Texas. The scientific organization (now 20 years old) publishes a monthly MUFON UFO Journal and holds an annual MUFON symposium, alternating from state to state. A steering committee was appointed to head the reorganization of the MUFON - NC group. Members of the committee are chairman George D. Fawcett of Lincolnton, Mrs. Jayne Ware of Winston Salern, Robert H. Hair of Eden, Ralph Jones of Lexing- ton, Sam Martin of Salisbury, Danny Barger of Lincolnton, George Lund of Charlotte and Henry Morton of Wades- boro. The program consisted of eyewit- ness reports, mystery photos from New Mexico, a video film with Budd Hopkins entitled \"UFO Abductions,\" and the results of a field investigation in Medulla, Florida involving two UFO occupants that involved a long Continued on page 22 17"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"Daylight Close Encounter By Stan Gordon During 1988, a wave of UFO sight- ings persisted throughout Pennsylva- nia, as a continuation of activity that actually began in August of 1987. Of the many close encounter incidents reported, one case stands out since it was a close range daylight sighting with associated physical effects. The sighting occurred on September 2, 1988, in a rural area of Cambria County, near the town of Ebensburg. The witness, a retired steel worker (name on file with MUFON/PASU) was sitting on a bench by his pond enjoying the good weather at 3 pm. He noticed an object that came out of the sky from the North, and began to move in his direction. Details Observed The object proceeded to hover about 50 feet in front of the witness, and was no more than 30 feet above the ground. It first stayed in position for about 45 seconds, then rapidly moved back into the sky once again towards the North. About one minute later, the object returned to the same spot, where it hovered again for about l l / 2 minutes before it once again moved back toward the North, and was not observed again. The object itself, was described as spherical in shape, about 15 to 20 feet in diame- ter, with the upper section silver in color, while the bottom underbelly was orange-red. In the center of the object was a glass-like amber colored window. With- in the window could be seen two lights, one yellow, the other green, which flashed alternately and in a synchronized pattern. At one point when the object rotated, a fin-like protuberance was seen on one side. The object was completely silent, but its movements were described by the witness as \"moving quick like a humming bird.\" About 10 seconds before the object departed, a white 18 mist similar in form to a cumulus cloud, was emitted from the bottom section of the object. No smell was detected. It was also noted as the object hovered, that the silver top section reflected sunlight on the near- by trees. Physical Effects The object had been hovering over a grassy field where the grass had grown to be about four feet tall. After it departed, at the location that the incident took place, it was noted that there was about a 12-foot circular area of grass, that was laid down in a swirled, counter-clockwise pattern. Other effects also occurred. Just before the object appeared, a nearby goose became upset, hollered, and ran into the pond. The witness who wears a hearing aid, had put in a new battery about two hours prior to the sighting, but it went dead after the object departed. The battery is normally active for four to five days after replacement. Also parked close to the sighting location was a new jeep and an older farm tractor. It was discovered that the batteries of both vehicles were dead after the sighting. Noise Night Before At about 4 am before this incident occurred, the daughter of the witness was awakened by her dog that was apparently quite disturbed. She then heard a loud sound, like air exhaust- ing, but saw nothing, and had never heard a sound like that in the area before. The entire sighting was observed for well over three minutes, giving the witness the time to have a detailed sighting of what appears to be a legit- imate UFO observation.

Taylor, an aero- nautical engineer, was airport man- ager at Longview, Washington on the third and was in charge of an air show that afternoon. At 10:40 a.m. Taylor and a number of personnel already at the airport spotted the first of three UFOs to pass over the area. Among the over 150 persons present were police officers, city officials, a number of Longview's leading citi- zens, and many experienced pilots. All of the witnesses, many using binoculars, agreed that the craft was shaped like a discus. It seemed to have a metallic luster and appeared to be one-third of the moon's diameter. About nine minutes later a second discus appeared over the area, and a third craft at 11:25 a.m. Other sight- ings were reported around the area on the same day. *** THIRTY FIVE YEARS AGO — July 1954: After a year's visit with scientific centers in California, Frank Halstead, in charge of the University of Minnesota observatory, stated that: \"Aircraft of some sort have visited the Earth from outer space. The best scientific minds in the world agree that some planet out there is sending these things to look us over.\" In a full page article on UFOs in Die Weltwoche, Zurich, Switzerland, on the ninth, Dr. Carl Gustav Jung, the famous 83-year-old Swiss psy- chologist, jumped into the UFO con- troversy with both feet. Jung was asked, \"Do you think that if it were found that we were being investigated by non-human intelligent beings, the fact could be accepted without harm- ful results to our present conception of the universe...?\" In answer Jung said, \"If the origin of UFOs should prove to be extra-terrestrial, then intelligent interplanetary relations MUFON UFO Journal, No. 255, July 1989 would be a proven fact. What this would mean to humanity cannot be foreseen ... The reins of power would be taken from our hands, and we would have to say, as an old medicine- man once said to me, with tears in his eyes: 'We have no more dreams.' \"Our spiritual progress would be hopelessly anticipated, and consequent- ly paralyzed. Of course our science and technology would immediately have to go into the attic: that the construction of these machines requires a scientific knowledge far superior to our own admits of no two opinions ... To be sure it would put an end to war — just as the Pax Britannica brought an end to tribal warfare in Africa. We would roll up the Iron Curtain and use it for scrap metal, along with millions of tons of guns, warships, and ammunition. That in itself would not be so bad ...\" *** THIRTY YEARS AGO - July 1959: The pilot of a Pan American airliner outbound from San Francisco, California on the llth, reported sight- ing a \"gargantuan\" UFO which buzzed the passenger plane at \"inconceiva- ble\" speed before disappearing. Four other trans-Pacific airliner pilots report- ed sighting the same type object. Capt. George D. Wilson, 43, a 19- year flying veteran, made the first radio report of the sighting about 1,000 miles east of Honolulu, Hawaii, at 6:02 a.m., PDT. He said the object appeared as \"one intensely bright light followed by four smaller lights.\" Wilson, cruising at 20,000 feet, said the object \"first appeared about 1,000 feet above us and to our left. My co- pilot and flight engineer stared open- mouthed as the light came toward us at an extremely high rate of speed. \"For at least ten seconds it main- tained its course which was on an opposite heading to us, and had it been another aircraft it would have passed well to our left. Suddenly the object made a sharp right turn at a speed inconceivable to any vehicle we know and the light suddenly disap- peared. The smaller lights were evenly spaced and were either a part of the UFO or this was an example of darned good formation flying.\" Wil- son, visibly shaken when he landed in Honolulu, said he had never seen anything like this in his 19 years of fly- ing. He added he never believed such foreign objects existed. \"I'm a believer now,\" he said. Other pilots reporting similar sightings included two Pan American pilots, one Canadian Pacific, and one Slick Airways. On the following day, Mrs. Freder- ick Moreland, Blenheim, New Zea- land, had a close encounter with a UFO. Here is her story: \"At 5:30 a.m., I went across the paddock to milk the cows ... and I noticed I was bathed in a green light and that all the paddock was green, too. My first thought was — I shouldn't be here — and I made a dive for the trees where I stood and watched. A disc-shaped craft with two indented green lights in the bottom descended. The air became very warm. Two rows of jets around the middle shot out orange-colored flames. The craft was about 20-30 feet in diameter and hovered at about roof top height. \"The jets stopped and a light was switched on in what appeared to be a glass dome or roof, which glowed. The bottom appeared to be of a grayish metal color. There was a faint hum in the air as it hovered. There were two occupants in it, dressed in fairly close-fitting suits of shiny mate- rial. Opaque helmets rose from their shoulders. I could not see their faces. One of the men stood up and put two hands in front of him as if leaning over to look downwards. He then sat down and, after a minute or two, the jets started again, and, tilting slightly 19"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"at first, the craft shot up vertically at great speed and disappeared into the clouds. When it did this it made a soft but high-pitched sound.\" *** TWENTY-FIVE YEARS AGO — July 1964: Five young boys said they saw what appeared to be a spaceman and his vehicle on the 16th in a field about two miles from their home in Conklin, New York. The boys said they were walking in the field and saw the spaceman 50 to 75 yards away, according to the mother of one of them. The boys insisted they were telling the truth and broke into tears of protest when told they would be punished if they were fibbing. Mrs. Edmond Travis said she first learned of the experience when three of the boys came running into her house shortly after 12:30 p.m., seeking a jar of water. \"They said they were taking some water over to the spaceman,\" she said. \"They said they couldn't understand what he said but that it sounded like he needed water.\" An adult was sent after the two other boys, who were found walking home from the field. At first they denied having seen a spaceman, but later admitted they had, Mrs. Travis said. They said they hadn't seen the being at first because they were afraid their grandfather, who had picked them up, would not believe them and would \"give them a licking\" for fib- bing. The children were seperated and questioned individually. Each gave the same story. They said the space- man was about the size of a little boy, had a human-looking face and wore a black suit with black helmet. The being was wearing a plastic or glass lens over his eyes and was making a peculiar noise that the boys described as sounding like a child's kazoo. The spaceman walked toward a vehicle, part of which was obscured by foliage, that was \"shiny like a car bumper.\" The being then stepped up on top of the vehicle, the children said, whereupon they asked him if he needed help or water. Then the spaceman seemed to fall backwards from the top of the vehicle, the child- ren told Mrs. Travis. The youngsters then left the field and ran toward 20 home. An observer who visited the field later noticed matted foliage where the boys said the vehicle was. There were also three depressions around the matted area, as though whatever had crushed the foliage was sup- ported by columns or legs. The youngsters involved in the incident ranged from ages five to 10-years-old. *** FIFTEEN YEARS AGO - July 1974: Two highly respected police officers were astonished when they spotted a UFO on the ninth. The strange encounter occurred at 1 a.m. in a Kingston, New York park as Officers James Wallace and Richard Ramsell, both 26 and rated as \"extreme- ly reliable men\" by their chief, were in their car on a routine patrol. \"What the hell is that thing up there?\" Ram- sell exclaimed as he drove their patrol car into the park. They could see an object hovering silently about 200 feet above a softball field. Wallace and Ramsell could barely see the outline of a football-shaped craft about 30-40 feet in diameter. There was a row of alternating red and green lights around it and a hazy white light glowing directly in the center beneath it. Ramsell edged the car forward, then jammed on the brakes as the vehicle began moving toward them. Wallace got out to take a better look. The mysterious craft glided noise- lessly forward and the puzzled patrol- man now knew without a doubt that it wasn't a plane. When the vehicle was less than 500 feet away, Ramsell turned on his spotlight. He directed it toward the craft, but the beam didn't quite reach far enough. Wallace jump- ed back into the car just as a beam of brilliant white light shot out from the bottom of the vehicle and bathed the entire cruiser in light. Before the startled officer could move, the craft turned off the bright light and raced across the sky at a fantastic speed. Three teenage girls fled in terror to a nearby home when \"a huge metal object with flashing lights\" hovered above their heads at Catherine Field, Camden, NSW, Australia, on the 26th. Gabrielle Martin, 14, said she and her two girl friends spotted \"a huge egg-shaped object, as large as a house. It was all lit up with about 40- 50 lights all around it, and appeared to be made of shiny steel. The craft which made a high screeching noise stopped about 40-50 feet above us, then all of a sudden it swooped down to 30 feet. By this time we were screaming our heads off with fear and started to race across the paddock towards Mr. Nunan's home.\" The vehicle was described as being \"steel- colored,\" and covered the ground with a 50-foot circle of shimmering light as it swept over the paddock. An officer of the RAAF base at Penrith confirmed that a UFO had been tracked on radar near Catherine Field the same night. *** TEN YEARS AGO - July 1979: The quiet evening in Islampur (West Dinajpur), India, was suddenly shat- tered on the 10th when a fiery UFO screamed out of the sky to hover over a school — sucking off its metal roof and showering people inside with sparks. Villagers watched in wide- eyed terror as the ball of fire hung over the town for two minutes, filling the air with a foul odor. The myste- rious magnetic power of the object even tore a copper bracelet off the wrist of a woman and sent it flying. Then, just as suddenly as the destruc- tive fireball had come, it shot out of sight. \"We have dozens of eyewit- nesses who saw the UFO,\" said the local police chief, S.C. Adasthy. Local shopkeeper, Debendra Ghosh, 28, says the UFO's approach was preceeded by a \"terrible rumbling noise\" in the distance. \"I looked out- side and to my horror saw a ball of fire whizzing toward us from the nor- theast. It was showering sparks. As the ball came near the school build- ing, it suddenly changed direction and came lower. It hovered over the school — and the metal sheets ripped off the roof as if drawn by a magnet. Sparks rained down on the school and the ground below. Then the object, still emitting flames, shot off toward the southwest and disap- peared.\" Working inside the school were Continued on page 21 MUFON UFO Journal, No. 255, July 1989"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"Letters to the Editor ... Dear Editor, In regards to Dr. Ring's article on an imaginal interpretation of UFO abductions in the May issue, I'll get to the point. The idea of an imaginal world is absurd. There just isn't any room in hyperspace for it. Thus we should not start seeking archetypal aliens in the imaginal world, for in truth we may be the inhabitants of such an imaginal world being studied by real aliens to find out why we keep intruding on their world. If these aliens were to conform to our mythos, why aren't many of them giants like the Gods of old who swoop from the heavens and abduct our young women and keep them for a while in their sky castles? We see what we want to see and believe what we want to believe with the UFO/alien phenomena. It must be that the idea of real extraterres- trials (and there is plenty of room for them in normal space) is somehow threatening to those who want to prove the alien is a product of the great and mysterious collective uncon- scious. Personally, imaginal aliens don't interest me, but real ETs would have a tremendous impact on our culture. My experience with the phenomena just doesn't fit the imaginal model. I would like to affirm that which Ring negates: Real ETs exist and inhabit the galaxy as we do. Contrary to the good Doctor's opinion, it is logical and is based on sound scientific speculation. As for fairies, demons, goblins, and angels — they still retain their original archetypal form — and exist where they have always existed — in the mind of Man. And then there are those MIBs from a parallel universe which parallel the mythos of the boo- gey man. Welcome to the imaginal world of Ufology, Doctor. — William Hamilton Lancaster, CA MUFON UFO Journal, No. 255, July 1989 Dear Editor, I am very skeptical of the \"extrater- restrial\" origin hypothesis for the pot- assium chloride samples in \"Pennsyl- vania Law Officer Reports CE2 Incident\" by Stan Gordon in the May issue of the MUFON UFO Journal. Potassium chloride is a common min- eral that is used in fertilizer (as Mr. Gordon states) and road salt. It would not be unusual to find this mineral in Australia or Pennsylvania. Mr. Gordon argues that pure potas- sium chloride is not used to salt roads. This is true, however, road salt is not pure sodium chloride either and may contain substantial amounts of potassium chloride, clays, and other minerals. The 40 mile/hour winds could have easily blown the salt onto the car from neighboring fields or roads. Since the incident occurred in December, salt was probably abund- ant on the roads. It will be nearly impossible to \"prove\" the extraterres- trial origin of the potassium chloride, although researchers could try look- ing for unusual trace elements or specifically identifying the clays. — Kevin R. Henke Grand Forks, ND LOOKING BACK, continued three carpenters. One, 18-year-old Sunin Bhowmick, recalled: \"All of a sudden there was this terrible noise above us, and the iron sheets on the roof started flying off and collapsing on us. At first we hid under some benches, but then decided to make a dash for safety. I fell over one of the metal sheets — and was amazed to find that it was very hot. The air was filled with a burning smell, like gun- powder. The odor was so strong that I nearly became sick,\" Bhowmick said. Fire Chief S.K. Sen said the school was \"a shambles\" when he arrived 15 minutes later. \"More than 80 sheets of corrugated iron had been torn from the roof. Some were found more than half a mile away,\" he said. \"They had been twisted out of shape by the force that wrenched them from the bolts holding them on the roof. Some were still hot. \"Iron grills in the school kitchen's oven were twisted, and the school walls were cracked. Dozens of people surrounded us as we arrived, all tell- ing the same incredible story of a UFO like a fireball that had torn through the village like a tornado.\" Housewife Sishubala Gain, 50, said her whole body started to tremble unexplainably when the UFO roared down on the town. \"I was wearing a copper bracelet around my left wrist — and suddenly it was torn off,\" she said. \"I found it later, broken and lying a few feet away.\" DAYLIGHT, continued reported by its residents during the 1988 year. While a number of close encounters have been investigated, two reported landings were claimed by observers.

SUPPORT UFO RESEARCH MUTUAL UFO NETWORK SEGUIN TEXAS 78155 The Night Sky By Walter N. Webb MUFON Astronomy Consultant July 1989 Bright Planets (Evening Sky): Venus (magnitude -3.9) continues to lie very low in the WNW, setting only V/ 2 hours after the Sun in mid-July. The brightest planet approaches the much dimmer Mars and passes only l / 2 ° above it on the 12th. Venus then approaches and passes one degree above the star Regulus on the 23rd. A very young crescent Moon is quite close to Venus on the Fourth of July. Mars, staying at 1.8 magnitude, moves from Cancer into Leo and is difficult to see very low in the WNW. Look for it in the vicinity of Venus. The faint ruddy object will be impossible to find by month's end when it sets only an hour after sunset. The lunar crescent is not far to the upper left of Mars on the 5th. Saturn, at zero magnitude in Sagittarius, is opposite the Sun on July 2 and therefore rises in the ESE about sunset and remains visible all night low in the southern sky. Bright Planets (Morning Sky): Jupiter (magnitude -2.0) moves from Taurus into Gemini. The bright plane- tary giant rises in the NE about 4 AM daylight time on July 1 and about 2:30 on the 31st. On the 2nd Jupiter lies less than a degree to the left of dimmer orange Mercury and 5° below the crescent Moon on the 29th. Saturn is very low in the WSW at dawn. Meteor Showers: The July Aquarid meteors peak on the morning of the 28th. A fat crescent Moon may reduce the maximum of 20 per hour visible before dawn. Some members of the shower can be seen for about a month starting in mid- July. They produce relatively slow (25 miles per second) long streaks from the southern sky. During the last week of July, the first of the swifter (37 miles per second) Perseids joins the Aquarids but originates from a north- erly direction. Moon Phases: New moon — July 3 First quarter — July 10 Full moon — July 18 Last quarter — July 25 The Stars: € O 22 The summer constellations are well established now. At 11 PM the Summer Triangle approaches the zenith. One of the Triangle stars is the third brightest in northern latitudes — brilliant white Vega. The second brightest in our area is orange Arcturus visible in the western sky. West of Vega is the four-sided Keystone of Hercules introduced last month. Look for a \"fuzzy star\" along the west (or right) side of the Keys- tone. Moderate-sized amateur telescopes begin to resolve this spot of light into the multitude of stars known as the Hercules Globular Cluster. Light from this snowball of stars takes some 20,000 years to reach us on Earth! Low in the south the teapot-shaped centaur Sagittarius aims his arrow at the reddish heart of the scorpion, the star Antares. Scorpius is easy to spot, with curved claws to the west, Antares behind the head, and a long stinger-tipped tail curling upward in the south.

New Officers At a reorganizational meeting of MUFON - North Carolina, Henry Morton State Director relinquished this post and appointed George D. Fawcett, Assistant State Director to succeed him as State Director for North Carolina. Mr. Fawcett joined MUFON in 1971 as a State Section Director in Tennessee and later that year served in the same capacity for North Carolina. He became the first State Director for North Carolina in 1974. Robert H. Hair of Eden, NC was selected to become the new Assistant State Director and repres- ented North Carolina at the Annual MUFON State Directors meeting in Las Vegas. Thomas P. Stults, State Director for Illinois, made several organiza- tional reassignments and new appoint- ments to strengthen the Illinois inves- tigative team. William A. Leone, State Section Director, is now respon- sible for Kane and DuPage Counties. Due to the population density of Cook County (Chicago) and the immense responsibility, Cook County was assigned two State Section Direc- tors with Madison Street in Chicago as the dividing line. Jerry Lafferty, Jr. of Burbank is covering Southern Cook County and Benjamin D. Granito, living in Chicago, directs Northern Cook County. Mr. Stults appointed Forest Crawford of Col- linsville as State Section Director for Madison and Jersey Counties. Each of the above gentlemen took and passed the MUFON Field investiga- tors examination before being assigned their new duties. Paul Russell of Pekin was made the State Section Director for Tazewell, Woodford, Mar- shall, Stark, Peoria and Fulton Coun- ties and John Rinaldo, residing in Cherry Valley, has responsibility for Winnebago County in Illinois.
