He recalled the incident as follows. On January 12, at about 10:20 AM CST, he was working at his desk in his office. There is a large win- dow facing north northwestward through which he can see the southern shore of Gulf Breeze about a mile away across the Santa Rosa Sound. As he happened to glance out the window he noticed a shiny object sta- tionary in the sky west northwest of him. After looking at it for several seconds he realized that it wasn't an or- dinary aircraft. The center appeared to be a somewhat spherical or oval shape, or like a short vertical cylinder with spherical caps at the top and bottom which had, at the left and right, a collection of much smaller, similarly- shaped objects. It looked like a UFO he had seen once before in November, 1993. He had, on two occasions in November, seen and videotaped a UFO that he saw through the window. On another occasion he video- taped one which he saw at Pensacola Beach. This time he was determined to get a good photo- graph. His Canon camera with a Soligor Autozoom 70- 220 mm (f/3.5) lens was in his office and loaded with Konica XG100 film. He grabbed the camera and walked quickly onto his deck where he pointed it toward the UFO. He twisted the barrel of the lens to the infinity fo- cus position and zoomed in on the UFO. Then he de- cided he should take a wide field of view photo first, so he slid the barrel back toward a shorter focal length. He always operates his camera on automatic exposure so he didn't have to make any shutter speed or f/stop set- tings. (The film exposure adjustment on the camera — the ISO or ASA setting — assures that the camera will automatically select a combination of shutter time and f/stop which will produce a good picture under the light- ing conditions of a particular scene.) As he was viewing the UFO through the lens and preparing to take the first photo he heard the noise of a jet. He looked to the north and saw a jet that appeared to be approaching the UFO from the northeast. He waited until the jet entered the field of view of the lens and then took the first photo. After the first picture he quickly \"zoomed'' to the maximum focal length setting on the lens while holding the focus at infinity. At first he couldn't see the UFO in the field of view because he moved the camera as he zoomed. It took several sec- onds, perhaps four or five, for him to relocate the UFO and steady the camera. Just before he pushed the shutter button he noticed the jet was again within the field of view, approaching the UFO. He took the second picture. The jet appeared to bank somewhat and head west or southwest, past the UFO. Ed also saw that there were two other jets flying in the same direction but higher up in the clouds. They passed the UFO and continued in their southwestward track and then made a large turn to the west and north and swung around until again they were heading toward the UFO. The planes were not traveling at an extremely high rate of speed. Rather, said Ed, they seemed to be traveling quite slowly. Ed said he stood in awe. expecting to see the real Star Wars begin any second if the jets attacked the UFO. T he UFO wasn't moving and so Ed delayed taking more pictures until a plane and the UFO were again within the field of view of the camera. But this didn't happen. Instead, the UFO zipped off at such a high speed Ed could not be sure of where it went, although it seemed to him to travel to the east. (A high speed de- parture has been reported numerous times by witnesses over the years. Sometimes the disappearance would be so fast as to make it seem that the UFO had \"disinte- grated.\" High speed departure has been documented by \"Martin Allen\" in a video made in March, 1993, and again by Ed Walters on November 28, 1993.) It ap- peared to Ed that the UFO did not move during the whole period of time that he saw it until its sudden dis- appearance. The total sighting lasted several (2-3) minutes. The jets continued southeastward and passed over Pensacola Beach perhaps several hundred feet to the west of Ed's location. Then they turned again toward the north or northeast and departed, flying in a loose eche- lon. Ed said that they had what appeared to be numerous rockets under the wings and that the lead jet, which ap- pears in the pictures, had red-tipped wings. The bodies of the jets were dark grey. (I wondered whether or not someone else might have at least noticed the jets. Ed pointed out that jets fly around a lot and people tend to ignore them.) AFTER THE SIGHTING Soon afterward Ed took some more pictures to use up the roll and then had them developed at a \"one hour\" type of photoshop. He saw that he had the plane to the right of the UFO in the first picture and, to his great sur- prise, in the second photo the plane blocked from view the right side of the UFO. He then called Don Ware, a retired Air Force officer, to find out about the jets. Don JUNE 1994 NUMBER 314 PAGE 3"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL Plioic No I UI'O (left) wiihappwaUimg F15 (right). told him that Eglin AFB might send up several jets if they detected a \"bogey\" on radar. Don then suggested that the airplanes could be F-15's, based on Ed's de- scription of aircraft with swept-back wings and double vertical stabilizer fins at the rear. Photos and drawings in Jane's All the World's Aircraft ( 1992 edition) suggest that that the airplane in the photos could be an F-15 Eagle 'air superiority\" fighter jet (built by McDonnell Douglas; overall length, 64 ft.) or an F-18 Hornet (built by McDonnell Douglas; overall length, 56 ft.). Experiments were carried out with plastic models to determine whether or not the shapes of the various types of aircraft, as seen in perspective, would match the shape in the photo. These experiments showed that the F-15 made the best match. (Note: other aircraft that have been suggested include the F-4 and the F-16. However, these do not have the double vertical stabilizer fins at the rear. All the fighter aircraft that have been suggested as appearing in the photos have lengths in the rather narrow range of 55 - 65 ft. and hence calculations of distance to the airplane, which play an important role in the following analysis, can be based on any one of them. This analysis assumes the plane was an F-15.) Don Ware said he was told by some Eglin personnel that when F-15's carry camera pods on the tips of the wings, the tips look orange colored. This was confirmed by Bob Reid, also a retired air force officer, in a con- versation with other Eglin AFB personnel. The second photo does not show the wingtips well enough to either prove or disprove that they are orange-tipped, although there does seem to be a spot on the leading edge of the wingtip that is a bit brighter than the rest of the image of the wing. Ed reported seeing white objects under the wings which he assumed were missiles. Missiles are not obvious under the wing of the airplane in the second photo, perhaps because of shadowing by the wing and because of the distance to the aircraft. However there are two faint, whitish \"blob\" images under the wing that might be missiles or some other devices. I tried to estimate the distance to the jet and hence to the UFO. since the jet appears in front of the UFO in the second photo. Without actually seeing the photo I ini- tially assumed about 60 ft. as the effective length in perspective. I also assumed a 220 mm Effective Focal Length (EFL) for the lens, even though I knew that the actual EFL was a bit smaller. From Ed's measurement of the image size on the photo I estimated the distance at about 2 miles. Ed was surprised at the result of the cal- culation and stated repeatedly that he thought the UFO was closer, possibly only a about a mile away over the Santa Rosa Sound. Subsequent analysis, reported here, caused me to revise my initial distance estimate down- ward to about 1 1/2 miles. Based on the sighting direc- tion recorded in the photo and the distance estimate it appears that the UFO was nearly over the southwestern shore of Gulf Breeze. PHOTOGRAPHIC ANALYSIS (Note: The following calculations have been done with 1% accuracy or better. However, they are based on lengths and angles that are not known precisely. Consequently, azimuth angles aie given to the closest de- gree, lengths to the nearest toot and distances to the nearest 100 feet. The calculations are presented under the assumption that this event really happened. A dis- cussion of the hoax hypothesis, which was rejected after due consideration, follows the technical discussion. Some readers may wish to skip ahead to that section.) Photo 1 shows the UFO and the jet approaching from the right and heading to the left. The angular size of the jet was calculated from the ratio of length of the image on the negative (0.49 mm) to the measured lens focal length for photo 1 (about 91 mm): (0.49 mm/91 mm=) 0.0054 rad (rad = \"radians\") or about 0.31° (.0174 rad = 1 degree). The actual length of an F-15 from the front (nose) to the rear edge of the vertical fins is about 60 ft. (18.3 m). If the \"projected length\" of the jet (the size as it appears in the perspective view) were known, then one could use this length with the angular size to calculate the actual distance from the camera. Unfortunately the exact direction that the jet was flying relative to the sighting line is not known so an exact projected length cannot be determined. However, it is possible to make a reasonable guess based on information provided by the second photo and an assumption about the direction that the jet would have been flying. The second photo shows that the jet got very close to the UFO. The analysis of the aircraft image in photo 2 (see below) suggests that the aircraft was about 8,300 ft. (2.5 km) from the camera at that time. (NOTE: the fol- lowing calculations are based on a distance of 8,300 ft. to the jet in photo 2. The reason for this estimate of dis- PAGE4 NUMBER 314 |UNE 1994"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL PllOltt /Vc. 2.

It\" the actual distance were greater or less than this, then the calculated sizes, etc. in the following will scale proportionally.) In order to carry out useful calculations 1 have assumed that the UFO was only a few hundred feet farther away than the jet (from the camera) in photo 2. I have further assumed that the pilot did not fly exactly toward the UFO. but rather in a straight line from the location in photo I to the location shown in photo 2, which is slightly south of the UFO. F inally. I have assumed that the UFO did not move during the time between the photos. (This assump- tion is consistent with Ed's statement that it didn't seem to move at all until the very end of the sighting.) I have used the second and third assumptions along with the 9° angle between the direction to the UFO (300° a/imuth) and the jet (309° azimuth) and along with the estimated distance of the jet in the second photo (8,300 ft.) to calculate the distance of the jet in photo I. Entering these quantities into trigonometric relationship between sides and angles of the triangle made by the camera, the jet and the UFO, 1 find that the jet was traveling almost due south toward the UFO and was about 9.000 ft. (1 .1 mi, 2.1 km) from the camera. At that point it was also about 1.500 ft. high and about 1,600 ft. (490 m) from the (stationary) UFO. T he UFO image looks somewhat like a fat plus sign. However, there are slight \"bumps\" in the outline of the horizontal portion which could be consistent with the shapes which I refer to as \"outboard fuel tanks\" that are seen more clearly in the second photo. The top and bottom of the vertically oriented center portion may have a circular shape, similar to that shown in photo 2. If so, this would be consistent with Ed's description. Unfortunately, the edges of the image are not sharp enough for me to be certain of the shape. The angular length of the horizontal section is about Lufo = 0.0034 rad (0.2°), the angular height of the vertical center sec- tion is about Hufo = 0.0022 rad (0.13°) and the angular height of the side \"wings\" is about 0.0011 rad (0.063°). Unfortunately there is no way of determining how far away the UFO was in photo I from the evidence in that photo alone. However, we know from photo 2 that it was farther away than the jet which (see analysis be- low) is estimated to have been about 8,300 ft. away. How closely would the jet have approached to the ob- ject? I do not know this. However, the assumption used previously, that the jet flew toward the UFO, suggests that the jet approached to within a few hundred feet. In other words, using the jet distance as 8,300 ft. from the camera in photo 2, the UFO distance may well have been about 8.500 ft. away in both photos. At this dis- tance the angular sizes measured from the film and camera correspond to a length of about (0.0034 x 8,500 = ) 29 ft. (9 m) and a height at the center of about (0.0022 x 8,500 =) 19 ft. (6m). The height of the horizontal sec- tions at either side of the central section are estimated at about half the height of the central section. For other as- sumed distances (any reasonable distance greater than 8.400 ft.) the calculated size of the UFO will be larger or smaller in proportion to the distance. The angular ele- vation of the jet is slightly greater than that of the UFO: 0.165 rad (about 9.5°) vsO.152 rad (about 8.7°). At the above estimated distance of 9.000 ft. the plane was about (9,000 sin(9.5°) =) 1,500 ft. (450 m) high. The UFO altitude, assuming it was 8,500 ft. away, was about 1,300 ft. (390 m) high. Again, if the distances were dif- ferent then the heights were proportionally different. At the bottom of the first photo is the Santa Rosa Sound and the shoreline at the southwest end of the Gulf Breeze Peninsula. The photo shows a rather dense morning haze which diminishes in concentration with in- creasing elevation. The UFO seems to have glints from the upper portions of the curved surfaces, consistent with illumination from the sun which was about 35 de- grees above the horizon and not quite due south of the UFO. THE SECOND PHOTO The second photo was taken with the lens set at full zoom. The photo shows the blue sky background with weak haze at the bottom of the picture which decreases with increasing elevation in a manner that is consistent with the haze shown in the first photo. The second photo also shows a most amazing coincidence: the plane image overlaps the UFO image. (Recall that Ed saw the plane entering the field of view just before he took the second photo. He did not know where the plane would appear in the photo until after it was developed.) The oblique view of the plane shows that it was turned somewhat toward the camera. In other words, the JUNE 1994 NUMBER 314 PAGES"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL PROJECTED LENGTH 38 feet I TO CAMERA 60 ft. (18 m) long centerline of the jet was not 90° to the sighting direction. By comparison of the image of the F- 15 with a scale drawing in Jane's I determined that the (acute) angle between the centerline of the plane and the line of sight was about 40°, which means that the ap- parent length along the center of the fuselage, as seen in perspective of the photo, was only about 60 sin 40° = 38 ft. (11.5 m). The length of the image of the fuselage (centerline of the jet) on the negative is 0.98 mm. During experiments in 1990 (related to the analysis of UFO photos taken on Jan. 8, 1990) I determined that the Effective Focal Length was about 214 mm. Combining the image size with the EFL yields the angular size, (0.98 mm/214 mm =) 0.0046 rad (0.26°). Dividing the projected length of the aircraft by this angle gives a distance of about 38 ft./0.0046 = 8,260 ft. or about 8,300 ft. (2.5 km) or about 1.6 miles. A consequence of the previous assumption that the UFO didn't move be- tween photos is that the angular elevation of the jet in the second photo is the same as the elevation of the UFO in the first photo, 0.152 rad (8.7°). Thus the altitude of the jet was about (8,300 sin(8.7) =) 1,300 ft. (400 m). Obviously the UFO was farther away than the air- plane, although I do not know the actual distance. Therefore, I have arbitrarily assumed a distance of 200 ft. which makes the UFO distance about 8,500 ft. The approximate vertical angular size of the visible portion of the central part of the UFO, as seen below the front of the airplane fuselage, is about 0.0018 radians. At a dis- tance of 8,500 ft. this angle corresponds to a height of about 15 ft. (4.7 m). This is smaller than the total height of the central portion calculated from the image in photo 1 for the same distance, about 19 ft., because the airplane blocked the view of the top part of the central portion of PAGE 6 NUMBER 314 JUNE 1994"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"MLJFON UFO JOURNAL the UFO in photo 2. The jet blocked the view of part of the right half of the UFO. leaving a little more than half of it visible. The part which is visible appears to have a horizontal row of shiny features which I have called \"outboard fuel tanks\" (\"OFT\") for lack of a better term. The length of the visible part of this row of OFT is 0.002 rad which corresponds to about 17 ft. (5 m) at that distance. This is a bit more than half of the 29 ft. esti- mated total length as calculated from photo I. The an- gular height of the \"'OFT is about 0.001 rad, or about 8.5 ft. at the assumed distance. This is smaller than the height of the horizontal sections at the left and right of the center part as calculated from photo 1 (about 9.5 ft). The difference is probably a result of the diffuseness of the edges of the images and their small size (especially in photo 1) which makes it difficult to decide just where the edge of an image really is. The width of an OFT would be about 4 to 5 ft. These calculations establish that the UFO size estimates from the two photos are consistent and support the assumption that the UFO did not move between photos. The OFT appear to have bright oval sun glints on their upper surfaces. They also have lesser glints below the main glints indicating that they have \"non-simple\" shapes (not simply spheres, cylinders, ellipsoids, etc.) The upper and lower portions of the sphere surface also seems to have faint glints indicative of complex surfaces not resolved by the photography. The upper glint, which is almost completely blocked by the airplane, seems to be whiter and brighter than the lower glint. P art of the fuzziness of the outline of the jet could be attributed to jet motion. Unfortunately there is no way of knowing exactly how fast the jet was going. However, a rough estimate can be made by combining the (estimated!) distance that the jet moved between photos with the estimated time between the photos. The angular distance between the sighting line to the nose of the jet (309°) and sighting line to the center of the UFO (300°) is about 0.154 radians or about 9°. Using the trigonometric method referred to before along with the distance to the jet in photo 2, 8,300 ft., 1 have estimated that the jet was about 1.600 ft. from the UFO in photo I. Thus it traveled this far during the time between the pho- tos. If the time between the photos were 5 seconds then the speed was about 320 ft./sec. (220 mph); if the time were 4 seconds, the speed was about 400 ft./sec. (270 mph); if the time were 3 seconds the speed was about 533 ft./sec. (36().mph). Ed said that he lost the UFO in the field of view of the lens immediately after he zoomed and then had to reacquire it. This suggests that 3 seconds is probably a lower bound to the time, which means that the actual speed was probably not greater than about 360 mph. These low estimated speeds are consistent with Ed's claim that the jet was traveling quite slowly compared to the speeds of military jets that he often sees in the area. Clearly the plane was not breaking the \"sound barrier\" (about 1,100 ft/sec, at sea level). Could this speed account for some image fuzziness? In order to determine this it is necessary to know the shutter speed. At my suggestion, on January 13 Ed went outside, pointed his camera at the sky and looked at the \"light meter\" in his camera. He mentioned that the sky was considerably clearer on the 13th than at the time of the UFO photos the previous day when the sky near the horizon appeared almost white. He determined that for both of the focal length settings that he used, the camera operated at f/8 or f/6.7 at 1/250 sec. when look- ing at the blue sky. Subsequent tests in April showed that the camera adjusts both the shutter time and the f/stop as the light level changes. Furthermore, it is sensitive to haze. A hazy white sky with little or no overcast, simi- lar to the conditions on January 12, is brighter than a clear blue sky. Tests done on days when the sky was very hazy near the horizon, as it was on January 12. yielded camera settings ranging from 1/350 at f/9.5 to 1/500 at f/l 1 and 1/750 at f/13, depending upon the di- rection the camera was pointing. (These exposure set- tings are all for ISO 100 film.) Based on these mea- surements I expect that the shutter time when the UFO photos were taken was 1/350 or 1/500 of a second. If the camera shutter closed in 1/350 sec. and the plane traveled at, say. 400 ft./sec. (270 mph), then the plane would have moved about 1.1 ft., or about 1.9% of its length while the shutter was open. If the camera op- erated at 1/500 sec. or less and the plane traveled at 500 ft./sec. it would move only about 1 ft. or about 1.7% of its length. The distance the plane moved would be foreshortened by the perspective view to about (sin 40° = ) 0.64 of the actual distance, just as the length of the airplane itself was foreshortened. These percent- ages are so small as to be barely distinguishable from or- dinary edge blur. However, a photoanalysis technique known as \"two dimensional Fast Fourier Transform\" (2-D FFT). utilized by photoanalyst Jeff Sainio, has found a small but no- ticeable difference between the spatial frequency spec- trum of the edge of the fuselage (parallel to the direction of motion and hence not smeared by motion) and the spectrum of the trailing edge of the rear wing edges (perpendicular to the motion direction and hence smeared by motion). (The spectrum of the fuselage has more high frequencies than in the spectrum of the edge of the wing.) Hence I conclude that the aircraft was not traveling at a high rate of speed and, in fact, was proba- bly moving at a speed of less than 400 mph. The same 2- D FFT shows that the UFO was not moving. TRUE UFO OR HOAX? Certainly the UFO does not look like a natural object or a usual sort of man-made object in the sky. Hence one might suggest that if it is not a TRue UFO (TRUFO — an unnatural, non-man-made object, possibly a space- JUNE 1994 NUMBER 314 PAGE?"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL ship), then it was either an unusual man-made object or that the sighting is an outright hoax. The unusual man- made object that most nearly resembles the UFO is a cluster of balloons, or \"cluster balloon.\" A cluster bal- loon consists of a large cylindrical balloon with spheri- cal caps at the center of a collection of several (as many as a dozen?) considerably smaller round balloons. These smaller balloons would, presumably, account for the presence of the \"OFT\" around the large central portion of the UFO. However, this identification contradicts Ed's de- scription of how the UFO departed (\"instantaneously\"). Even if a collection of large balloons were to explode all at the same time (unlikely), they would not fall so quickly as to seem to just disappear. Ed would have seen them falling downward. Furthermore, balloons have buoyancy and they are driven by the wind. They do not remain stationary unless they are perfectly counter- balanced against ascension or are tethered. For a balloon to hover at a fixed location in the presence of even a gentle breeze would require a tether, in this case a tether more than 1,000 ft. long. No indications of tethers or of filling apertures (usually on the bottom of a balloon) or of ropes, etc., to tie the balloons together are seen in ei- ther photo. Clusters of large balloons, such as this would be, typically are used to carry instruments to high alti- tudes. They do not remain at an altitude lower than 2,000 ft. Finally, comparison with photos of balloon clusters shows that this object does not resemble a clus- ter of balloons. Therefore, for numerous reasons I reject the cluster balloon hypothesis. The UFO resembles nei- ther a blimp nor a helicopter, and neither of these can de- part instantaneously, so I reject them as well. The UFO does not resemble any fixed wing aircraft nor does it re- semble a hovercraft. Therefore the \"unusual man-made object\" must be rejected. A typical hoax hypothesis assumes that a couple of models were hung from a suspending frame using thin thread and these were photographed against the background scene. An alternate suggestion which re- quires more sophisticated photographic techniques is that these are double exposure photos or photos of re- flections of models in plate glass. These latter sugges- tions must be rejected since portions of the images, and especially of the bottom of the jet in photo 2, are darker than the background sky. In a double exposure or re- flection on glass each point on the image must be at least as bright as the background. Still more complicated photographic methods such as the masked double exposure (use a mask to block the background in the area of the UFO model image) or compound image rephotography (make two complete photos, one of the background and one of a model, cut out the model image and paste it on the background photo and photograph the combination) are rejected for reasons of difficulty and for the lack of any evidence in the photos that these techniques were'used (mistakes in using these methods tend to be obvious). Similarly, \"high-tech\" methods using computer image creation/combining is ruled out by the difficulty as com- pared with the minima] skills of the photographer. (Note: the last three are Hollywood-level techniques which re- quire experts.) The first hoax method, hanging models from strings, is the only one that is compatible with the equipment and technical capability of Mr. Walters. I discuss this method in the following paragraphs, although I should point out that the discovery that the image of the jet was smeared slightly by motion makes it difficult to imagine how Mr. Walters could have hung a stationary model UFO next to a moving model jet. I should also mention that in order to obtain satisfactory photographs using this technique the typical hoaxer would take a series of pic- tures and select the best ones. However, these two pho- tos of Ed's were sandwiched in a roll between other non-UFO photos. There are no \"model UFO test photos'' on the roll of film. I f these are small models they must obey the angular size \"rule\" that the angular size of the jet in photo 1 is about 0.0054 rad which means that the size of the hy- pothetical model airplane must be 0.054 ft. = 0.64\" for each 10 ft. of distance, e.g., 0.64\" if 10 ft. away. 1.28\" if 20 ft. away, etc. Hence at a reasonable hoax distance, say 30 ft., the actual size of the model airplane (and of the UFO) must be about 2 inches. As the assumed distance to the models increases the sizes of the models in- creases. The models could be suspended by a horizontal bar attached to a vertical bar that is stuck into the ground, for example. In order to decrease the likeli- hood that a suspending thread would be visible in the photos the hoaxer would want to have the models as far from the camera as possible. However, as the distance to the models is increased the height and length of the horizontal bar must in- crease since it must stay out of the picture (photo 1) which has a field of view of about 14° from the horizon (at the shoreline across Santa Rosa Sound, which ap- pears near the bottom of the photo) to the top of the pic- ture and about 11 ° from the center of the photo to either the left or right side. Thus at 30 ft. the horizontal sus- pending bar would have to be more than 7.5 ft. above the camera altitude, which itself was about 13 ft. above the ground level. The vertical bar (or bars) supporting the horizontal bar would have to be more than 6 ft. to the left or right of the center of the field of view for the sus- pension system to be out of the picture. This makes it difficult to imagine that large distances and models were used. Also, 140 or so feet beyond the location where Ed was standing is the shore of the Santa Rosa Sound. A distance of 150 ft., for example, would put the models over the water. PAGES NUMBER 314 JUNE 1994"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL A t my request Ed carried out two experiments to de- termine what typical objects would look like if suspended from a framework. He used a variety of small objects suspended from a horizontal bar that was attached to a vertical pole that was about 30 ft. away. In one experiment he used clear monofilament fishline to suspend the objects (2\" long pipe fittings!). The monofil- ament was easily detected as a faint dark line against the pale blue sky even when the focal length was 91 mm (not \"zoomed in''). In the second experiment he sup- ported the objects from a framework 30 ft. away using pale blue thread in an attempt to match the sky color background. This thread appeared as obvious white lines above the suspended objects in the 91 mm and 214 mm focal length photos. One problem with using a suspending thread became immediately obvious: unless the thread color and brightness matches the sky color and brightness at each point along its length it will be detected. This would not be a problem if the sky color and brightness were ex- actly the same at all points alongside the suspension. However, the fact is that the sky brightness and color change with altitude, i e., there is a vertical color/bright- ness gradient ( i.e., the amount of change per change in height). Hence, to remain undetected, any vertical sus- pension must match not only the color and brightness at any point but also the color and brightness gradient. Another problem with the \"hiding the suspension\" scenario is that the sunlight on the suspension can create a sort of glint or variation in brightness (reflected sun- light) along its length. This problem would appear if a horizontal thread were used to overcome the problem created by the vertical color/brightness gradient of the background sky. In this case one could pick a thread to match the color/brightness of the sky at one angular el- evation and stretch this thread across the field of view of the camera at that chosen elevation. (The thread would have to be more than 12 ft. long if the models were 30 ft. away, and proportionally longer or shorter as the dis- tance is changed, e.g. 24 ft. at 60 ft. distance.) For this clever hypothetical method to work it would also be necessary that the sky color and brightness re- main uniform across the whole field of view and that the apparent brightness of the thread be constant across the whole field of view (i.e., that the brightness and color of the thread match the sky across the whole field of view). Unfortunately that isn't likely. In Ed's photo 1 the sky brightness varies considerably in the vertical direction and also somewhat in the horizontal direction. Ed's experimental photos were taken from the same location as the UFO photos and in the same direction. Hence they showed the nearby framework and the hang- ing models as well as the distant beach and houses that appear in his first UFO photos. These photos were all analyzed by Mr. Sainio who made an important dis- covery—the quality of the focus of the edges of the objects hanging at 30 ft. was different from the quality of focus of the distant beach. In particular, using a 2-D FFT technique discussed above he determined that he could tell whether objects were nearby (tens of feet) or far away (hundreds to thousands of feet) by the distribution of \"spatial frequencies\" in the edges of the images. Hence Mr. Sainio found that he could determine whether or not Ed's first photo was created by photographing nearby models. He discovered that the degree of focus of the UFO and F15 is similar to that of the beach, indi- cating that the UFO and F15 were distant objects. CONCLUSION Hence for this reason and the other reasons I have listed I reject the suspended model hypothesis. Since the dou- ble exposure and glass reflection hypotheses have al- ready been rejected, and since the UFO cannot be a cluster of balloons, I conclude that the UFO is unex- plainable as conventional phenomena. These pictures prove two things: (1) UFOs are real and (2) the military knows it! © 1994 Bruce Maccabee Photo No. 3: Enlargement of UFO.

I'which forced me to rethink my conventional no- tion of reality. From that time forward I've studied the UFO phenomenon with increasing seriousness, and with a particular interest in the way the subject has been treated by scientists, mental health professionals and the media. Thirty years is a long stretch, and in that time I have seen massive changes. This once lightly regarded phenomenon has slowly but inexorably moved toward the mainstream of public awareness. With some hesitation I'm using a military metaphor here to deal with this profound social issue—the war we researchers have been waging to force the UFO phe- nomenon into serious public and scientific consideration. And this is the war we've finally begun to win. Back in the 60's and 70's, what little media or scientific attention there was was usually of the silly-season, why-bother- with-this-foolishness variety. Physicist Edward Condon's outrageous misreading of the data his own committee had assembled marked the high point of the media's attention to the UFO phenomenon. After Condon's grandiose dismissal of the evidence, if UFOs were dis- cussed at all, they were most often thought of as a weird psycho-social phenomenon, particularly by the mental health community. If, as George Bernard Shaw once sagely remarked, bad publicity is a contradiction in terms, its corollary implies that no notice at all may be the only truly bad publicity. Unfortunately, in the '60's and 70's there was little consistent mainstream attention to the phenomenon, good or bad. But through the 80's and into the 90's that has been changing drastically. Press attention has become the norm. Now, instead of UFO researchers having to plead with the media for a speedy squint at the accumulating evidence, it is the aging squad of self-designated de- bunkers who have to beg for press coverage. Philip Klass, for one, appears irate at his diminished circum- stances. In his ever rarer media appearances, he bares his hatred for UFO witnesses ever more nakedly, until, as one viewer recently remarked, he has become on the TV screen a perfect blend of form and content. It must be galling to be viewed by strangers as an embittered crank, a dinosaur in the evolution of public awareness. By contrast, my own personal experience of public and scientific interest in, specifically, the UFO abduction phenomenon, has been thoroughly gratifying. If GBS is right and bad publicity is a contradiction in terms, it mat- ters less than one might think if the increasing volume of mainstream attention is always supportive of the UFO evidence. A case in point involves Carl Sagan's recent article on the abduction phenomenon in Parade maga- zine. Despite the generally negative conclusions of his piece, the fact remains that a distinguished scientist with a wide popular following was more or less re- quired by public curiosity to address the abduction issue, and, in the interest of fairness, to include at least some of the evidence in support of its reality. When prominent, mainstream figures are forced to deal with the subject with some degree of respect, abandoning their earlier portrayal of UFO abductions as a loony idea of the hol- low-earth variety, then a major beachhead has been es- tablished for the practice of scientific objectivity. And when the theories these skeptical scientists offer to dis- credit the UFO phenomenon are as weak as those Dr. Sagan presented, a large segment of the public will end up by reading the piece as an argument for UFO reality. T he beginning of this basic change in public and me- dia attitude can be dated to the spring of 1987 when three major publishers—Atlantic Monthly Press, Random House and Morrow—published books on the UFO abduction phenomenon. The nearly simultaneous appearance of Whitley Strieber's Communion, with it's compelling cover illustration of a staring alien head, Gary Kinder's Light Years, and my own Intruders ac- complished together what no single one of these books could have done alone: forced the abduction issue by the sheer weight of numbers into public consciousness. To my astonishment I found sources like The New York Times, 20/20, and the Washington Post treating my book, Intruders, seriously and respectfully. Important later books like Dr. David Jacobs' Secret Life and Ray Fowler's The Watchers built further upon the public's in- terest, and since then the momentum has never slack- ened. In the past year 1 have been interviewed many times by the mainstream media. Some of the resulting articles and edited TV appearances have been very supportive, some have been mixed, with attempts at fairness and ob- jectivity, and some, of course have been negative; only one has been unbelievably sloppy, inaccurate, and de- liberately destructive. But with that one exception, all have brought at least some valuable, positive informa- tion about the UFO abduction phenomenon into the public domain. I cite the following examples, not for rea- sons of personal vanity—many other researchers have been as frequently interviewed as I—but to demon- strate the breadth of media interest in the subject. Over the past months I've been interviewed by Paris Match, PAGE 10 NUMBER 314 JUNE 1994"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL The four witnesses were so naively unaware of the \"shoot the victim\" mentality of the debunkers that I decided to maintain confidentiality for them, whether they asked for it or not. the New York Times and the German newsmagazine Focus; by correspondent Susan Spencer for 48 Hours, and by the BBC; and on two occasions for different ar- ticles by Time magazine, as well as by less obviously mainstream publications such as Psychology Today and Omni. And on an even more personal note, as I prepare a long, thoroughly documented book on the subject, pub- lic curiosity about the Linda Cortile case has been fanned by extensive coverage in, among other places, the mainstream British newspaper The Independent, in Omni, and, in a more marginal publication, Fate maga- zine. Shaw is right; despite some predictable swipes taken by authors woefully unaware of the extent of the evidence in the Cortile case, these articles have included enough information to whet the average reader's ap- petite for more about this extraordinary series of events. The response of the mental health community to the idea that UFO abductions are real, event-level experi- ences has been equally gratifying. Over ninety-five thousand psychiatrists and psychologists have received copies of the Roper Survey of Unusual Personal Experiences, a booklet detailing what might be called the UFO abduction syndrome. Over one thousand, two hun- dred of these—more than one in a hundred—have sent the publisher requests for further information about ab- duction workshops, lectures and so on. Dr. David Jacobs, psychotherapist John Carpenter, Dr. John Mack and I have addressed a number of these subsequent work- shops and I have also accompanied Dr. Mack on \"Grand Rounds\" at Cambridge hospital. I've spoken to other gatherings of mental health professionals, their numbers by now probably approaching one thousand individuals. Thirty, twenty, even ten years ago this kind of wide- spread professional interest would have been unthink- able. The level of serious scientific discussion of the UFO abduction phenomenon, at the Temple University and M.I.T. conferences, for example, has been increasingly profound and rewarding. As the \"invisible college\" of concerned scientists and medical practioners has in- creased its membership, the sophistication of data gath- ering and analysis has also grown perceptibly. In this re- gard, it is of major significance that Dr. John Mack of the Harvard Medical school has just published a serious book on his work with UFO abductees. Though not yet prepared to go as far as he. other credentialed profes- sionals are now willing to admit publicly that an extra- ordinary phenomenon such as UFO abductions demands an extraordinary investigation. Ignoring the evidence is no longer intellectually respectable. The news that we researchers are beginning to win the war is unfortunately tarnished by some bad news: we are slowly losing one important battle. In a kind of last- ditch stand, the dwindling band of self-annointed de- bunkers has intensified its campaign to intimidate wit- nesses, to create an a priori climate of ridicule and dis- paragement for anyone who dares to come forward to describe personal UFO encounters—particularly ab- duction experiences. In the world of criminal law, the in- timidation of witnesses is a felony; in the court of pub- lic opinion there is no such stricture. It is perfectly legal for someone like Philip Klass to describe nervous, trau- matized men. women and children, victims of UFO ab- ductions, as ''little nobodies, people seeking celebrity status.\" In a stunning bit of unconscious self-description, Klass assured The New York Times that otherwise these \"little nobodies\" would never get to appear on Oprah Winfrey's show. His attack, cruel and self-revealing though it was, was nevertheless effective. As a direct re- sult, I was contacted by four different abductees who had read the article and now had second thoughts about coming out publicly to help John Mack describe the abduction experience and its traumatic sequelae. O ver the years, the hundreds of people I've dealt with who recalled UFO abduction experiences have come from virtually every socio-economic and educa- tional level. A NASA scientist, nearly a dozen police of- ficers, six psychiatrists, many doctors, lawyers, busi- nessmen, military officers and so on, from various lay- ers of society have declined to come forward to de- scribe their experiences publicly. A first-hand account by any one of these people would lend great credence to the mass of anonymous eyewitness reports, but each has too much to lose by doing so in the present climate of wit- ness intimidation. My own experience in this area is deeply cautionary. When three virtually unknown individuals on the fringe of UFO research decided to attack me by savaging the central witness in a case I was investigating—Linda \"Cortile\"—they not only revealed her name but also published highly personal material she had once lent to them. She had made the mistake of believing them when they said they intended to help her through their \"special skills and expertise.\" Subsequently they ques- tioned her husband's colleagues at work and the door- men in her apartment building, again using the fam- ily's real name and detailing Linda's UFO account. The inevitable effect of these unwarranted intrusions and violations of their promises of confidentiality was to subject her, her husband and sons to ridicule, and even to endanger her husband's livelihood. In a recent conversation with UFO Magazine pub- lisher Vicki Cooper. I realized that she—and conse- quently the public—did not know that it was I who made the decision to withhold the names of four other key witnesses in this case. These four were so naively JUNE 1994 NUMBER 314 PAGE 11"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL unaware of the \"shoot the victim\" mentality of the de- bunkers that I decided to maintain confidentiality for them, whether they asked for it or not. (Four more wit- nesses specifically asked me to withhold their names. One shudders at the thought of the names and phone numbers of any of these eight innocents falling into the hands of such unethical \"investigators.\") Over the years it has been my general policy to rec- ommend witness anonymity, so I have never tried to per- suade any abductee to \"come out\" publicly, despite the potential importance of such firsthand testimony. Science, the public and serious media sources have thereby been denied essential evidence about the UFO abduction phenomenon. What can we do to reverse the tide of battle and begin to create a climate more congenial to scientific research? Clearly, the issue is one of ethics. The problem is how to force the fanatics on the other side to give up the tactic of intimidation which has served them so well. One way to help bring this about is to refuse—absolutely— to deal with anyone on the (thankfully) short list of character assassins who regularly practice this im- morality. No researcher, witness or abductee should ever agree to participate in any media presentation which includes any of these people. They should be completely frozen out of serious discourse, period. They are a block to research and a hindrance to any dialogue of value. I have amicable relations with many civilized and eth- ical people on the skeptical side. Carl Sagan coming im- mediately to mind. There are other good people whom we must cultivate in order to establish a climate where genuine dialogue and the objective study of the evi- dence can flourish. Science can only be damaged by the present level of McCarthyite intimidation. Our side is clearly winning the war. The public and the mainstream media know that the UFO phenomenon is here to stay. Our job. now. is finding ways to end this one destructive battle. 1 look forward to a time when no witness, no abductee should ever hesitate to give testi- mony because of the fear for her reputation, for his ca- reer, for their children—just because a group of bullies do not want us to hear the truth. John Carpenter c ir ° \"Phobias and Resolutions\" A phobia is defined as a marked and persistent fear that is excessive or unreasonable, cued by the pres- ence or anticipation of a specific object or situation. The person recognizes that the fear is excessive or un- reasonable, and the resulting avoidance, anxiety, or dis- tress interferes significantly with the individual's normal routine. Resolution of specific phobias comes from dealing with the specific source of the fear by working through the feelings and desensitizing the perception of the source. This may be accomplished therapeuti- cally through imagery, hypnosis, or actual exposure to the source of phobic fear. The research and therapy involving UFO encounters and alleged abductions frequently include many inter- esting and often unique types of phobias. One of the most common fearful reactions in response to a UFO en- counter is the deliberate avoidance of a particular stretch of road or a specific area such as small city park or a cer- tain farm pasture. Many people find themselves dri- ving unusual routes way out of their way in order to cir- cumvent the feared area. The interesting aspect about this is that they often do not know what they are avoid- ing or why. One woman that 1 worked with told me that because she was missing mysteriously for two hours when she was eight years old, she cannot drive beyond a five-mile radius from her home as an adult unless she has very clear written directions and at least one detailed map with her at all times on the front seat of the car. Many others will drive ridiculous and illogical routes in order to avoid a certain area sometimes without con- scious awareness that they are doing so. Another common reaction is to objects which re- mind the participants of the entities themselves. One ex- periencer related how her daughter had been phobic at a . young age of certain pictures which had hung in her room—cartoon drawings from the 1960's in which gangs of dogs wearing big dark sunglasses are playing cards, shooting pool, or gambling at tables. The reaction was so intense that the pictures had to be removed from her room. It was those \"big dark sunglasses\" which re- minded her of the visitors who came at night—as learned in a hypnosis session almost twenty years later. Budd Hopkins tells of a lampshade which caused fear in one of his subjects because the light created a triangular design reminiscent of the triangular-shaped head of the little gray beings. But the subject did not make this connection at a conscious level—only at an emotional and subconscious level of awareness initially. One of my more interesting cases involving this type of psychological response is that of Cindy Doraty (daughter of Judy Doraty, a case publicized by Linda Howe) who at the age of four developed a dread fear of her own dolls because she thought \"they moved around at night.\" The next day she asked her grandmother to take her dolls to the railroad tracks behind their home and let the train run over all of them. That is clearly a hostile response which goes well beyond just throwing them out with the trash! Thirty years later she still had the phobia and had not even let her own daughter have any dolls. While we were working on her recollections related to her abduction experiences, we stumbled across a point in time in which a particular chair aboard the craft caused her to flash back to the age of four when she PAGE 12 NUMBER 314 JUNE 1994"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL first had seen that memorable high-back swivel chak and had been playing in it. She remembered being led by a taller gray \"female\" to a room full of \"odd-looking chil- dren.\" They reminded her of cancer patients because many appeared sickly with very little or no hair at all. When one little child attempted to smile at her—as if it did not know how, Cindy had a sudden and unexpected emo- tional response. \"That's my doll!\" she cried, bursting into tears. The queer little smile of the hybrid child was very similar to the painted-on \"toothy\" grin of dolls in those days. As a four-year old Cindy had been unable to process these confusing images of the hybrid children and needed to avoid dolls which were reminiscent of the troubling alien images of the hybrid children. This then generalized to all dolls until her unprocessed confusion was only recently resolved. Through hypnosis she was able to learn that the hybrid children were not scary, hurtful, or unfriendly. To her surprise she found herself feeling a \"sisterly bond\" with the one that smiled. Because of the new positive feelings, she had a desire to find and purchase some of those dolls after her session. S ome phobias are quite unique. A 20-year old man ex- pressed a peculiar fear of \"falling up\" if he were outside in an open area. He preferred hanging on to a fence or car door \"to feel safe.\" Although unfamiliar with UFO materials, his first session revealed a life full of classic abduction scenarios, including the reporting of unpublished data of which he could not have known. Another woman admitted she had a puzzling fear of becoming pregnant. Both she and her husband are fun- loving people who adore children. Since she had no physical fears of the pregnancy or birthing process, this phobia seemed out of place. The woman knew nothing about UFO research but was encouraged by a friend to tell me about a strange and vivid dream in which she was lying on a table surrounded by \"bug people\" in a round room. They took something from her but would not let her see it. Under hypnosis I tried to lead her and suggest \"wrong responses\" to her, but she could not be influenced. She described a classic table exam with the little gray beings removing a fetus and showing it to her. She became very upset when they told her telepathically that it was hers and that she could not keep it. Thus, her phobia was actually not of becoming pregnant, but, rather that if she became pregnant, she would dread not being able to keep the baby. After working through her sadness and anger, she was able to comprehend her fears and move forward with her husband toward be- ginning their family by trying very hard to become pregnant. Skeptics say that a strong belief alone can cure a phobia just as easily without dealing with the original source. After conferring with Dr. John Mack and other psychiatric professionals, it is agreed that such beliefs can bring temporary or superficial relief, but that a phobia is not likely to be truly resolved unless one has dealt di- rectly with its original painful source. And in these cas- es the existence of UFO encounters serve as the reality for each subject's pain, confusion and eventual relief.

While they are all informative in one way or another, they are not always enjoyable to read. \"The Alien Jigsaw\" by Katharina Wilson, Introduction by Budd Hopkins, is a shining exception. I found myself ea- ger to read about her next experience, hoping to get another piece to the puzzle of her life. Katharina knew very little about UFO's and alien ab- ductions when she first came to realize the meaning of the strange goings on throughout her life. She came to know that experiences like hers were happening to many other people. She wondered how many others might be having these interactions and were asleep to the memories or. worse still, afraid to share or ask for help out of fear of ridicule. Because of her deep conviction to the truth she wanted as many people as possible to know about the aliens' activities. The only story she knew well enough to tell was her own, so she began speaking publicly and wrote a book about her visitations. Several times during the writing of \"The Alien Jigsaw\" she debated whether to ex- clude some parts because of their personal nature. Luckily she did not. She felt that presenting all details and accounts was more important than her reputation or pride. I com- mend her for her courage and conviction. Katharina, a meticulous diary scribe since age twenty three, is easily able to reconstruct the pattern of events that indicate a lifetime of interaction with other-worldly be- ings. She writes them in such a way that you do not have to wait until the last chapter to understand the sto- ry. Each of her journal entries is preceded by the events she now knows to be significant relative to the alien en- counter. The verbatim journal entry then shows her mem- ories, thoughts and feelings at the time of the experience. She then examines these memories as the lucid adult she has become. She explains how each occurrence changed her and how she now feels about them. The book is written as if each journal entry was a whole story and yet, at the same time, a part of a larger story. An alien sto- ry. One that shows an alien influence interwoven into just about every person, place and thing in Katharina's life. Her family is not exempt from alien rendezvous and many times she reports going on board with or seeing her husband, friends, mother or father during an on board vis- it. She tells of many experiences that deal with hybrid or alien babies in nursery-like settings and has had the full range of genetic interbreeding experiments run on her. S ome of these experiences are very positive and emo- tionally fulfilling, others are hard for Katharinn to un- derstand given her intense love of all animals. This love of animals has been tested many limes by the aliens sometimes by asking her to choose between animals and people. She feels these challenges are tests, perhaps so the aliens can better understand our emotional re- sponses. Occasionally she is given free run of the ship and finds herself strangely familiar with its layout. Some of the aliens she encounters are emotional, compas- sionate creatures and others are cold and even cruel. Many of the fifteen different aliens described work to- gether (the good, the bad and the ugly). Several of these types are described here for the first time in print. She also reports the prescence of what appears to be U.S. mil- itary personnel working with the aliens. Her accounts also include what she calls \"teaching dreams\" wherein she was instructed and trained or shown what may be the future. As one moves through these experiences with Katharina you can sense the growth of her understand- ing and consciousness. 1 have been lucky enough to meet Katharina and found a person very diffferent than the one at the beginning of the book. She is confident and kind, eloquent and strong. There is a peace about her. The power of her conviction is evident in her actions PAGE 16 NUMBER 314 JUNE 1994"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL and words and I respect this greatly. As always these ex- periences, good, bad or neutral, are transformative. When you read her book you will find that she is not fighting a war—she is fighting a sleep. A sleep that we all must awaken from whether we.are having face to face alien experiences or not. She poetically expresses her deepest feelings about this limited view of reality in the \"Epilogue\" with a verse called \"The Painting\". This book is enjoyable for the casual reader wanting to know more about the alien abduction/contact phe- nomenon and the avid researcher with a hunger for de- tails. I think \"The Alien Jigsaw\" is one of the best books written by an experiencer about alien experiences. This book should be considered a \"must have\" for the re- searcher because it contains details about a wide variety of aliens and their business, many of which have never been published. The chapter that details the different types of beings tilled \"The Guys\" is worth the purchase price alone. Looking through the lens of Katharina's experiences one can get a clearer view of the large and complex picture of human-alien interaction.

MS 39705 Hard Cover, 160 pages. $19.95 Reviewed by Marc Davenport U ntil an idle conversation with relatives triggered panial memories of encounters with \"chalky-col- ored creatures,\" Leah Haley's life was as conservative and mainstream as it could be. Her Southern Baptist family had certainly not prepared her for \"alien abduc- tions.\" Neither had her master's degree in education, nor her experiences as a CPA and as a university instructor. The partial memories were so compelling that Leah was unable to function in her oh-so-normal environ- ment. She went to see John Carpenter, MUFON's Director of Abduction Research, hoping to be diag- nosed as insane, so that she could be treated and cured and continue her life as before. Carpenter hypnotically regressed her 14 times during the next 18 months. He found no evidence of mental ill- ness (although Leah did exhibit post-traumatic stress disorder, which results from real experiences). Leah re- membered being laken aboard UFOs as a child and as an adult. Memories recovered under hypnosis implied that her ova may have been used to produce some of the hy- brid fetuses 'she was shown in a bright room she de- scribed as a \"baby greenhouse.\" They also indicated that she had been abducted several times by human be- ings in military-style uniforms who used brutal methods in an apparent attempt to extract information from her about the chalky-colored creatures. On one of these occasions—and this is something that makes this case unique—Leah had apparently been ab- ducted and was aboard a UFO when it was shot out of the sky and crash-landed on a beach. Leah resisted the idea that her experiences could be real. She argued that she must not have been hypnotized and that she must be insane, regardless of what her counselor said. Like hundreds of other abductees, she was not ready to let go of her old paradigm. But events that happened while she was fully conscious conspired against her assertions. She had conscious memories of being in a beam of light and of being interrogated by military types. Her house was broken into, she was fol- lowed, and she caught someone who worked for a NASA subcontractor snooping around her car. She was invited to photograph a space shuttle, only to discover later that guards around it had orders to shoot to kill. She began to receive enigmatic telepathic communications from an unknown source. She found physical evidence that verified her encounters were real. And so on. Lost Was the Key is the clearest and most credible of all contact accounts. Its precise, easy-to-read language and absorbing, page-turning story takes the reader through the processes of discovery, denial, acceptance, the shattering of personal reality, investigation of every facet of the abduction experience, and reflection on how the author's experiences changed her. The author uses no unnecessary words, but simply tells her story. And throughout the book, she steadfastly refuses to jump to unwarranted conclusions, always qualifying, always questioning, always considering all the possi- bilities. As John Carpenter states in his introduction: \"...her own careful documentation and tireless inves- tigative efforts reflect a determination to find the truth objectively with several clever and bold attempts to verify information retrieved from hypnotic regressions.\" Leah Haley's astonishing courage moved me and I heard the ring of truth in her words. And her meticulous documentation of her unique experiences has since proved invaluable in my own research. I recommend this book as an absolute must for anyone interested in UFOs and abduction phenomena. Marc Davenport is the author of Visitors From Time: The Secret of the UFOs and the editor of CONTACT FORUM. He currently devotes all his time to investi- gating and writing and lecturing about UFO and ab- duction phenomena. Davenport and Haley have just announced that they are about to be married. JUNE 1994 NUMBER 314 PAGE I 7"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL Letters to Mufon UFO Journal ROSWELL In regards to the Journal's review of our The Truth about the UFO Crash at Roswell. I think there are a cou- ple of points that demand clarification. First, the testi- mony suggesting that one of the beings survived the crash is all second hand. Frankie Rowe provided some of it, based on what her father, Roswell fire fighter Dan Dwyer told her. Ruben Anaya provided other testimony that he said came from then New Mexico Lieutenant Governor Joseph Montoya. Barbara Dugger said that her grandmother, Inez Wilcox, wife of sheriff George Wilcox, said that Inez told her one of the \"little men\" had survived. There have been some other hints as well, but we have yet to find any solid first-hand corroboration of the story. We included these testimonies in the book because that was what the witnesses were saying. We felt an obligation to report, accurately, all that we had been told. But the point is, the testimony about a sur- vivor is second hand without the necessary corrobora- tion. That point should not be overlooked. Second, there is a point that may not be very clear. The press release issued by Walter Haul on July 8 was not a mistake or a military SNAFU. It was part of the carefully constructed cover that was an outgrowth of the events of the weekend. According to Frank Joyce, he had interviewed Mac Brazel on the radio on July 6, be- fore Major Jesse Marcel and Captain Sheridan Cavitt ac- companied him out to the debris field. That interview was broadcast, to the best of Joyce's memory, on Sunday afternoon. The military, having found the impact site the day be- fore, and having silenced the military participants as well as the civilian witnesses there, were probably sitting around congratulating themselves on having contained the story when the next thing they know, a story about strange debris is broadcast on KGFL Radio. Suddenly the story is no longer buried. Now they must do some- thing to contain that information. The press release, then, was designed to stop the spread of the rumors begun on Sunday. If it is analyzed carefully for how it is worded, that becomes clear. According to the release, the object has been recov- ered. It is on its way to Fort Worth. The rancher isn't identified, but Marcel is, but he's unavailable because he is on his way to Fort Worth, too. No exact location is provided, but they do mention a site 75 miles northwest of Roswell. So, we have a news story telling the public that a saucer has been recovered and its on its way to an- other location. There is nothing to see, for those who want to drive 75 miles northwest of Roswell to search. It seems that this is misdirection. The important find was much closer to Roswell, had already been removed, and now that rumors were spreading through Roswell, a newspaper story in the afternoon paper claimed that the \"real\" site was 75 miles from Roswell. Then, three hours later, word is released in Fort Worth that what was found was nothing more than a weather balloon with a radar target. Art McQuiddy, editor of the Roswell Morning Dispatch, said that by the next morning, July 9, the story was dead. No time for the curious to drive out to search for the site, especially on a Tuesday night. Besides, the press release said that it was already re- covered so there was nothing to see. The press release and then the discussion at Fort Worth effectively killed the story for more than thirty years. According to some of the witnesses, that was the whole purpose. It was designed to put an end to the ru- mors, and it must be admitted that the stories of July 8 and 9 did exactly that. When Roswell was mentioned at all, it was suggested that it was nothing more than a misidentified balloon. (For the purists, it must be men- tioned that Frank Edwards, in Flying Saucers — Serious Business, did mention Roswell but he provided nothing that would enable anyone to investigate.) The question that must be asked is if we want to be- lieve that there were military officers so bright that they could conceive the cover story. Were they bright enough to have planned this thing that well? We know that the balloon explanation worked to hide the Roswell story. That is what we're saying. The military officers on the scene were that smart. The conclusion then, is that the news release was made on purpose to divert attention and then kill the story. You are absolutely correct that there are some in- consistencies in some of the testimony and I believe, as you said, that much of it can be attributed to old mem- ories. Others are between first-hand memories and sec- ond-hand stories. In those cases we side with the first- hand sources. However, I believe we have an obligation to report all the data, not just that which we believe. Otherwise we would not have reported, for example, that Dr. W. Curry Holden's wife and daughter hadn't heard the story from him. Given the situation and the circum- stances, I believe that Holden told me the truth, not to mention that his story was corroborated by others in- cluding Dr. C. Bertram Schultz and Dr. W. Frankforter. There are gaps in what we know, certain bits of data to which we have no access. If we had all the answers, then some of these problems would quickly be elimi- nated. There is still work to be done because there are questions that we still have, too. But, if we eliminate the stories that have plagued this case from the beginning, the idea of a crash on the Plains of San Agustin, the tale told by Gerald Anderson, and the hoax of MJ-12, the picture of what happened outside of Roswell becomes clearer. But these minor problems do not explain the large body of eyewitness testimonies about the impact site, the PAGE 18 NUMBER 314 JUNE 1994"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL craft and the bodies. It must be remembered the story about the impact site is told by several witnesses inde- pendently. There is no evidence that they have been in communication with one another. But they do tell, ba- sically, the same story, providing us with the same basic location and same basic shape of the craft. These first- hand witnesses include Jim Ragsdale, Albert Duran, Lewis Rickett, \"Steve MacKenzie,\" Edwin Easley, John McBoyle. W. Curry Holden, and a couple of others who don't want their names associated with this. There are others who saw something happening, the military cor- don or the craft coming down, including E.L. Pyles, William Woody, C. Bertram Schultz, the Franciscan nuns, and the archaeological team. The one thing that we all must do is concentrate on the big picture. Sometimes we become so busy stepping on the ants that we overlook the elephants. —Kevin D. Handle we're afraid to be labeled \"crazy.\" We know that every open door of opportunity in our life can slam shut if the people we work with find out about us. Many of us may never build up enough courage to come forward to anyone with our experiences. Countless abductees live day after day in loneliness and isolation. Still, the pain of isolation seldom equals the fear of telling someone who's likely to reject you for it. When you think of all the effort and risk each expe- riencer has to go through in order to find self-confi- dence and credibility, it's a shame so many people choose to focus on the negative, destructive miscon- ceptions about the experience. Maybe they've forgotten, every abduction account they hear is not just a story, it is the very real facts of someone's life. No wonder there are so many ET encounter experiencers staying quietly hidden. And that's a shame, because we have so much to give to the world. —Michelle La Vigne Nashua, NH FALSE MEMORIES With all the recent talk about \"false memory syndrome\" and therapists using hypnosis to make people believe something happened to them that really didn't, I feel it is important to let people know that this doesn't seem to apply to the world of alien abductions. A fact that many people aren't aware of, and one seldom addressed in the media, is that just about all abduction experiencers remember things about their ET encounters before any hypnosis or regression. Quite a few are never regressed at all, but still have recall of ab- duction episodes. These events can date back to a time in their life before they ever understood such a thing as \"ETs\" even existed. Most of us have memories that go back to early childhood, events we remember long before we sought out help. Memories from childhood are often less stress- ful or dramatic than adult memories so they are rarely addressed in the media. Because of this, it's far less likely these memories are coining from outside influ- ences such as books or TV. It's been suggested that people are being led lo be- lieve they are experiencing encounters with ETs and then allowed to fantasize the details, which they do to please their doctor or to get his attention. The idea that someone will make up alien abduction stories for this reason doesn't really hold water when you think of the incredible stress involved in coming forward with ac- counts of abduction. It's important for people to realize that because of the confusion and trauma associated with first discovering you are interacting with aliens, few want to believe this is happening to them. People having encounters with ETs don't just wake up one day and say, \"Wow, I've been abducted by aliens. Cool! Now I can get on Oprah.\" We go through months, often years, of self doubt and fear. We fight the desire to find help because JUNE 1994     NUMBER 314 MUFON I would like to respond to issues raised in MUFON's April Journal. Both Mr. Jeffrey's and Mr. Brethwaite's \"Call to Anns\" could have dramatic implications for the future of UFOlogy and Anomalies Research. While both authors make important points regarding the level- headed scientific investigation of UFOs and related phe- nomena, I feel the need to voice my own concerns. First, American UFOlogy is constantly being fac- tionalized by the search for the \"case of the century.\" From Lazar's tales of reverse-engineering alien tech- nologies, to the supposed \"authentic\" MJ-12 documents offered as proof of an all-powerful government con- spiracy. From the controversial Ed Walters UFO photos to the Linda Cortile \"High-Rise Abduction\" case. These \"cases of the century\" have resulted in angry mud-sling- ing and the resignations of certain researchers from their respective organizations. The Roswell, New Mexico crash is a case in point. While I am the first to admit that something of extreme in- terest happened out in the desert during that Summer of '47,1 am concerned about the increased rallying behind this case. I have signed the declaration included with Mr. Jeffrey's article and will be sending it lo MUFON's Seguin headquarters, yet I cannot shake the feeling, that somehow we are being \"set up.\" It has become all too clear that certain agencies of the government and military are bent on manipulation of UFOIogy's belief in UFOs (read Extraterrestrials). UFOIogy's penchant for disin- formation proliferation has also been demonstrated (wit- ness Bill Moore's Las Vegas Symposium revelations). How can we be sure that any information released on the Roswell Affair is \"the truth\"? Those involved in the Cover-Up Paper Chase have failed to note a most salient point. If this supposed grand cover-up exists would they PAGE 19"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL really leave a paper trail?'Don't these conspirators have paper shredders? Any information released by a \"cover- up\" is most probably, at least partially, fictitious. As Oliver North said, cloak the truth between two lies and convince your audience that that is the Truth. In this way your audience is always ignorant of the whole truth. Finding that kernel of truth is still a worthy cause and I will cease my criticism of these Paper Chasers. My point, as regards the push to find Roswell's kernel of truth, is that we must not anxiously await our govern- ment to tell us of this supposed Truth. The \"truth\" behind Roswell may have been so deeply buried long ago that whatever explanation our government gives could simply be one agency's best guess. Or worse, another agency's further disinformation. Worse still, it could end up as an- other Condon Committee; the GAO or another inves- tigative body announcing to America and the world that it was just a weather balloon. As before, this would con- vince the skeptics (and perhaps a good deal of the popu- lace) that this is not a subject worthy of scientific inves- tigation. But this would, of course, not deter the believers who will continue to cry Cover-Up and whose belief will only be reinforced by such government assertions. For these reasons I caution MUFON members to pro- ceed in the fight to uncover the Truth and not to look to Roswell as the quintessential case which will \"set the record straight\" as to the origins of UFO phenomena. T he second issue I wish to address are certain sug- gestions made by Mr. Brethwaite. I respect his po- sitions on the problems of speculation and the need to im- prove the public's perception of UFOlogy. We do need to better allocate our resources with respect to investi- gation and publicity but I am alarmed at some of his sug- gestions. The proposed \"minimum education require- ment,\" as regards the MUFON political hierarchy, and the suggested increase of membership fees to $50.00 (!) could be viewed as a trend towards elitism. I am not ac- cusing Mr. Brethwaite of such elitism. I simply wish to point out that by executing such changes MUFON could be ostracizing the very members it depends upon for sup- port. How many members would MUFON lose by dou- bling the membership fee? And while MUFON strives to attain greater mainstream academic acceptance it could be perpetuating one of the most dangerous and insidious aspects of the UFO phenomena: its affronting of the very scientific institutions that ignore it. Dr. Jacques Vallee and other researchers have noted the phenomena's \"social deconstruction\" aspect which creates an antag- onism between the witnesses and investigators. Vallee has voiced his fears that Science's refusal to investigate this phenomena could create a cultural backlash, from ex- periencers and believers alike, which could conceiv- ably topple those same \"rational\" institutions. So while elevating the required education levels could raise cer- tain institutions' opinions of MUFON, it could also fur- ther exclude those people who already distrust these academic institutions for their lack of acceptance con- cerning UFO & Paranormal Experiences. Perhaps there is another option regarding the gener- ation of funds to support investigation and publicity. Perhaps it is time for MUFON to publish a special newsstand edition available to the general public. This would generate both money and publicity. Editing to- gether some of the most informative past & present Journal articles into newsstand editions would require lit- tle effort and could be done on a quarterly basis. If suc- cessful, perhaps the periodicity could increase to a bi- monthly schedule. I hope you will consider these points and not take them as an attack against MUFON or the Journal. In fact the May 1994 issue is one of the best I can remember reading in quite a while. The sober chronology of events regarding the Guardian Affair was long overdue. Mr. Kulikowski's UFO volume speculations were especially intriguing. High Strangeness reports are always appreciated (es- pecially by subscribers of The Excluded Middle and Crash Collusion magazines). Roberta Puhalski's article on Abduction Support Groups was excellent, though I would urge tolerance and investigation of New Age claims rather than patent dis- missal. Speculation can be healthy, while \"belief is the death of intelligence.\" Also, Mr. LaMoreaux's letter regarding Scientific Credibility was appropriate, yet we mustn't forget that science has its place and need not remain the \"cold and unfeeling\" institution that some see it as.

NATIONAL UFO INFORMATION WEEK Virginia M. Tilly, Director of Public Education, has an- nounced that the National UFO Information Week has been scheduled for August 13 through 21, 1994, which includes two weekends. Now is the time to start prepar- ing exhibits, information literature handouts, closed cir- cuit TV of UFO videotapes, and specifically making reservations at local shopping malls and libraries. This is an ideal event to educate the public to the UFO phe- nomenon and its implications to the scientific future of the world. FIELD INVESTIGATOR'S MANUAL OUT OF PRINT The third edition of the MUFON Field Investigator's Manual is temporarily out-of-print. It has been removed from the MUFON Publications List. Work is progress- ing very well on publishing an expanded version to be identified as the fourth edition in the near future. Please do not delay conducting Field Investigator training classes due to the absence of the fourth edition. Some sections or chapters of the present manual are only be- ing updated, whereas new sections on abduction inves- tigations, animal mutilations, crop circles, and poly- graph will be new. Explicit instructions on completing Form 1 and Form 2 will also be new. An expanded section on interviewing witnesses by Dan Wright will be an asset to the new manual. The availability date and price will be announced in the Journal. Please do not back order the new manual, since it will be doubled in size, and the price has not been determined from the printer. We are excited about the fourth edition, since it will be a state-of-the art pub- lication.

ROSWELL DECLARATION 1994 The response to the Roswell Declaration supporting the request for an Executive Order declassifying any U.S. Government information regarding the existence of UFOs or extraterrestrial intelligence, mailed to the MU- FON headquarters office, has exceeded all of our ex- pectations. Many of our members have reproduced the declaration that appeared in the April 1994 issue of the MUFON UFO Journal and solicited their friends and colleagues to support this very important program. The J. Allen Hynek Center for UFO Studies (CUFOS) also reproduced the Roswell Declaration in their March/April 1994 issue of IUR International UFO Reporter. This entire program has been the brainchild of Kent Jeffrey (Fairfax, CA) with the cooperation of MUFON, CUFOS. and FUFOR. Mr. Jeffrey is to be congratu- lated for this ambitious undertaking to capitalize upon the current interest in the Roswell Case via books, arti- cles, videotapes, and motion pictures. He has also pro- vided significant financial support to other aspects of this program in his own very modest manner. It is amazing what one person can do in Ufology when they apply their minds, hearts, and determination to a specific pro- ject. Mr. Jeffrey is promoting a similar program in Europe through the Mutual UFO Network - Central European Section (MUFON-CES). CENTRAL REGIONAL DIRECTOR ELECTION Three very qualified candidates were nominated for the vacancy on the MUFON Board of Directors for Central Regional Director. They were Walter L. \"Barney\" Garner, Jr., State Director for Louisiana; William E. \"Bill\" Jones, Ohio State Director, and John C. \"Jack\" Kasher, Nebraska State Director. A ballot was enclosed in the April 1994 issue of the Journal for all of the members encompassing the central states in the U. S.A. John C. Kasher, Ph.D. was elected by his constituents to this prestigious position by popular vote. In addition to his duties of supervising and assisting the state di- rectors, evaluating UFO sighting reports, just to name a few; he will serve as the host moderator with Jerold \"Ron\" Johnson, Deputy Director of Investigations, at the State/Provincial Directors Meeting in Austin, TX on July 8, 1994, from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. A special thanks is extended to Barney Garner and Bill Jones for agreeing to be candidates and also to George R. Coyne, the retiring Central Regional Director. ASSISTANT TO INTERNATIONAL DIRECTOR It is a distinct pleasure to announce that MUFON's Corporate Secretary, Thomas P. Deuley, has become a part-time employee of the MUFON headquarters of- fice, with the additional title of Assistant to the Director. The MUFON Board of Directors approved the hiring of Mr. Deuley at their annual meeting in 1993. A very knowledgeable man, skilled in many appropriate fields. Tom will make it possible for MUFON to accomplish projects and programs that were on the drawing board, but in need of someone with his talent and expertise. Mr. Deuley will be an asset to MUFON as we continue to grow worldwide. t MUFON 1994 SYMPOSIUM The theme for the MUFON 1994 International UFO Symposium \"UFOLOGY: A Historical Perspective,'' commemorating MUFON's 25th anniversary and sym- posia.
