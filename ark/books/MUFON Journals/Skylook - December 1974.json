Pere Redon and Sr.' Joan Crexells. PART I The Witness \"My name is Maximiliano Iglesias Sanchez. I am 21 years old. I am from Salamanca. A truckdriver. I work here, in Lagunilla, in the service of Sr. Aquilino Garrido Bernal, with this vehicle. I am dedicated to the trans- port of materials wherever he orders me. I normally go, quite frequently, all throughout this district. I go, quite often, into that sector where these ships appeared to me.\" (translator's note; the word ships is used instead of spacecraft or UFO's as we would use). Thus the witness presented him- self to newspaper reporter Don Angel Gil, who interviewed him for the \"La Gaceta Regional\" (Regional Gazette) of Salamanca. Sr. Gil describes the young man to us as \"of normal physical appearance. Blond. With expression totally nor- mal. And from his form of relating the events seems to have a normal mind and an order of ideas and of ex- pression without confusion nor con- tradictions, keeping in mind t.at he has undergone an official investiga- tion under the direction of the Civil Guard and has told the story a great number of times.\" Angel Gomez Escorial, special en- voy of the magazine from Madrid \"White and Black,\" commented in this respect: \"Maxi Iglesias does not seem very imaginative. If he is lying, he does it to perfection. Our impres- sion is that he is a stable individual.\" Later, Maxi explains to the news- paperman that this summer he will go into the military aviation service and that \"I do not know what I am going to do when this military service ends. Perhaps I will go into the Armed Police.\" In respect to his employer's opinion, Sr. Garrido says: \"He is a very hard working young man, very serious and incapable of lying.\" Finally, it is interesting to point out that the young man attended primary and secondary school in Salamanca and that at the age of fourteen began to work as a mechanic. Maxi told our correspondent in Bejar, Sr. Vicente Rico .Gil, that he does not read any- thing about science fiction or similar things and that he likes very much to read about the life of animals. The Sources The first news of the case was writ- ten in \"The Regional Gazette\" of Sal- amanca, through an article by Don Angel Gil which was published on March 29. The newspaperman appar- ently became aware of the observa- tion thanks to an interview made a few days after the events occurred by an announcer of Radio Bejar, of which we possess a recording on cas- sette. Throughout the 30th and 31st of March the entire Spanish press was echoing the observations of Maxi Iglesias, when the mini wave of 1974 came to full climax. Finally, it is worth citing the article which ap- peared in \"White and Black\" of Madrid with the date of April 6. Our correspondent in Bejar, Sr. Vicente Rico Gil, interviewed the witness on May 21, that is to say two months after the events took place. Of this interview, we possess an ex- tensive recording on cassette which together with the broadcast tape from Radio Bejar have constituted the fundamental pillars for the edit- ing of this work. (Sr. Vicente Rico Gil collaborated with our associate, Albert. Adell, in the investigation of the case of the Pantano Gabriel Galan, the dam which is found rela- tively near the place of the events which now concern us. First Observation Between 9:30 and 10:00 p.m. of March 20, 1974, Maximiliano Iglesias arrived in his truck at Pineda, in ful- fillment of his job. Once this was completed, Maxi went to visit his sweetheart, who resides in this vil- lage. About 2:15 or 2:30 a.m. in the early morning of the 21st, after having passed by the village of Horcajo on his return to Lagunilla, Maxi ob- served a white and very strong light on the highway some 700 to 600 meters away. In the beginning he thought it involved another truck or car. He switched his headlights to high beam and back several times so that the other vehicle would pass with its lights down but, it was not thus: \"The very bright light which almost was blinding me\" did not decrease (or diminish). Maxi continued forward until he was obliged to stop on the edge of the road, since he was driving off the pavement because of that light which prevented him from seeing the road. (It is necessary to point out that the young man used the brakes on the truck, meanwhile the diesel motor continued to run). Before continuing, he again switched his headlight beams up and down two or three times. On this oc- casion the light lowered its intensity, remaining like about that of a house of the country, that is to say with a weak intensity. Then he went on down the road until reaching about 200 —3—"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"meters from the light. Then he again signaled with his high beams and it was at this mo- ment when he realized that there was Something strange was on the highway something very strange resting on the highway: \"I was surprised,\" he says. Almost instantaneously, all the lights of the truck went out as well as the motor of the same. The area was illuminated only by the weak luminousity which the ship was emit- ting. The UFO There was a metallic structure of platinum or steel, solid, of smooth edges and without rivets nor open- ings (doors, windows . . .). It must have been about ten to twelve meters (30 to 36 feet) in diameter and was resting on the pavement on three round feet one half meter high. (Maxi stated that the object stuck out on each side of the road, which was about seven to eight meters wide). The UFO was giving off a weak light, but the light was uniform on all its surfaces; it was a light \"like I had never seen before,\" so that it was dif- ficult for him to explain its nature. To the right, and at about fifteen or seventeen meters altitude, another ship was seen, stationary and with a light even weaker. (On the recording by our correspondent, Maxi says that this second object was dark). The Two Beings Suddenly, from the right of the ship on the ground appeared (\"I don't know whether they were there already or if they came out from somewhere\") two beings, which stopped in front of the UFO at the center of the road. Those \"persons\" moved together, although not synchronized, and they began to motion to each other with their arms (\"like the tourists do\"). Then they looked at him, and one of them pointed to him. Shortly after- ward, one of the beings turned half- way around toward the ship and dis- appeared suddenly to the right, from where they had appeared at the begin- ning. The other one remained watch- ing him. In a short time, the former one re- appeared from the same place and went to join his companion. They looked at each other and again re- turned toward the ship, disappearing to the right of the UFO. A few sec- onds later the object raised up slowly, giving off something like a hum, which could not be heard when it was stationary. What were these persons like? Ac- cording to the description from Maxi, they must have been about 1.9 or 2 meters (6 feet) high. They were wear- ing suits similar to coveralls, close fitting, without creases, which cov- ered the entire body; the cloth was brilliant like the ship and similar to rubber (\"like-the frogmen\"). Their walking was perfectly normal: \"They walked with naturalness,\" stated the witness. Their arms and legs were like ours, in proportion. They did not appear to be robots. This article was published in the September issue of STEN- DEK magazine, and MUFON and SKYLOOK were given per- mission to use it through Sr. Redon, the MUFON Represen- tative for Spain. The complete translation was done by Dr. Willard P. Armstrong from the Spanish version, and it was ob- tained for MUFON by Joseph M. Brill, International Coordinator, for publication in SKYLOOK. In regard to the face—let us re- member that they \"looked\" at him and that they \"looked at each other\"— Maxi states that he could not see either at this time nor on the second observation, no matter how much he tried, how they looked at him. This detail worried him a great deal. On this occasion the witness excused himself by the fact that he was about 200 meters (600 feet) from the beings and that it had all occurred at night. Conclusion (for the first observation) The ship had climbed up very slow- ly in an oblique line to the right, until it was located parallel to the other motionless ship, with a distance be- tween the two of one or two meters. In this operation the ship did not change its luminousity. At this moment, Maxi says to our correspondent that \"although I was afraid, I thought that they were let- ting me pass and I passed by, since they had not done anothing to me when they were close.\" So he started the truck and everything ran again, engine and lights, and he passed by. However, at about 150 or 200 meters beyond the place of the observation, Maxi stopped the vehicle in order to see what the two objects were doing. He put out the lights and climbed down, being able to determine how the illuminated ship again landed on the same site. Then \"I was really afraid and I got out of there as fast as possible, since I told myself: I am getting out of here, because I don't want any trouble.\" He arrived at his house in Lagunilla and went to bed without eating any food. Reactions in the Village On the following morning Maxi explained his adventure. During the meal he related to various neighbors of the town what had happened, but no one believed him at all. However, in the afternoon, the son of his em- ployer went to see him and told him that he believed him, since the night before the television station had given the news about the case in Seville, the one about the commercial travel- ler, Mr. Sanchez. Second Observation In the afternoon of that same day, March 21, Maxi again went to Pineda to take a load of construction ma- terials, hurrying with the unloading so that he would not be getting back home very late. As soon as the un- loading was finished, and as was his custom, the young man went to visit his sweetheart. In a long conversation he explained to her what had hap- pened just a few hours before. Then she insisted that he should remain, and not return to Lagunilla, since it was beginning to be late and she was afraid to have him go out again that night. The other members of the family said the same thing. But Maxi, not listening to their ad- vice, began the trip back a few min- utes after 11 p.m. that night. (This is a fact of interest, since in this way it has been relatively easy to calculate the exact hour at which the events which we are relating occurred.) It was approximately 11:15 p.m. when he arrived at the point of the —4—"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"previous observation of the very bright light. And the phenomena was repeated. This made him think, \"Here they are again.\" But, since on the former occasion they had not done anything to him, he continued on his way until being stopped at about 200 meters from the bright light. Three ships resting on the ground On this occasion the light was pro- duced by three ships resting on the ground. The point where he was stopped is exactly the same as on the other night, since he knows very well this highway and remembers it through some details; therefore he deduced that the UFO's were located exactly on the same spot. As was pointed out, Maxi stopped the truck, and similarly to the former occasion, all the lights of the truck and the engine went out (with a back- fire, let us remember that), so that it was all dark, a thing which permitted him to observe perfectly everything that would develop moments later in the zone illuminated by the three ships. These were on the ground, one of them on the asphalt and the other two to the right of the witness, in a straight line to the side of the road and in the field. The separation be- tween could be determined at about eight or nine meters and giving the sensation that the three were located in the same plane. The light—from each one .of them— was quite weak; no differences in intensity being distinguished between them, all being illuminated equally. As on the previous night, there ap- peared suddenly four persons, nor was he able this time either to deter- mine if they came out through some aperture or if they were already there. The four beings went to the center of the road, that is in front of the ship resting on the asphalt. The four looked toward him \"atten- tively\"; meanwhile it seemed as if they were talking to each other by means of gestures. Moreover, they pointed toward where he was lo- cated, and in a few moments they began to move in his direction. The walking was normal: they placed their feet on the ground and advanced at a normal pace. Maxi, \"somewhat upset\" on per- ceiving this maneuver, opened the right hand door of the cab and began to run along the highway, being able to perceive how the four beings also had begun to race after him. Conse- quently he chose to go off across country. The initial distance which separated them was about 200 meters (the distance between the ship and Maxi), but in spite of his efforts the advantage gradually decreased, a detail which he determined from time to time by looking back to see if they were following him. At the end of two kilometers or a litUe more, Maxi saw on his right a ditch for drainage or irrigation. Ex- hausted as he was he did not hesitate longer and threw himself headlong so as to throw them off the trail, since now the four beings were dangerously close: \"they almost laid a hand on me\" were his words. Although he did not know the purpose of the ditch, Maxi supposed that it was intended to conduct irrigation water, since he was now covered from head to foot with mud. From this hiding place he was able to follow closely the movements of the four individuals. Thus, Maxi ob- served that the four were \"close to- gether in an attitude of search, cir- cling around his vicinity at a distance of some 14 or 15 meters. In spite of their proximity they did not manage to spot him, since he tried to crouch down and not make any movement which might reveal his presence. Although the night was dark and from time to time it was drizzling, he could distinguish the figures in the vicinity without making out details of the same, in spite of having them so close. At one moment he was able to observe how the four \"persons\" spread out, surely with the intention of covering more ground for the search; then they came back to- gether. (In the interview with our correspondent he says: \"They sep- arated, took several turns around, and when I again stuck out my head they were not there. I waited a little while and ...\"). Then they went away off to the left. In a short time, and since they seemed to have gone away, Maxi de- cided to leave the hiding place. He crossed the highway and walked toward the right, until-he arrived at about 1500 meters from Horcajo, making out the lights of the village. The young man did not dare to call any of the neighbors, since it was too late and because they never would believe him if he made them accom- pany him and the UFO's would have disappeared by that time. Immediately he sat down, remain- ing in this position for some ten min- utes. Meanwhile he smoked a cigar- ette in order to calm himself. Then he cautiously returned to the place where the truck was located in the belief that the zone would be de- serted. However, it was not thus: the three ships were still there; of the four beings not a trace was seen. Immediately he went toward the 1974 MUFON UFO SYMPOSIUM PROCEEDINGS \"MUFON—A Positive Ap- proach to the UFO Enigma\" by Walter H. Andrus, Jr. \"UFO's—An Issue Whose Time Has Almost Come\" By.

So that before climbing into the cab, he took a turn around the truck just in case and looked in to see if there was something or someone in- side. But everything was normal. Once inside he attempted to start the vehicle going without success, since on turning the key the engine did not start. Then he closed the door producing the consequent sound; almost simul- taneously the four individuals sud- denly appeared in the center of the highway as at first. They again mo- tioned to each other with their arms and looked at each other. Immediate- ly they went off to the right of the ship resting on the asphalt where they disappeared. And after a few seconds the ship began to move, climbing slowly with- out the illumination changing inten- sity. It climbed and moved sideways away from the center of the road, locating itself exactly over the other two which were in the field at an altitude of about 15 or 17 meters. On this occasion also was heard a hum- ming sound, which stopped when the UFO stopped moving. The impression which Maxi got from all of this was that they were leaving the road open to him as on the preceding night. He again at- tempted to start the truck, succeeding on the first attempt and turning on the lights as easily as in a normal situation. \"And I buzzed out of there.\" However, just as before, Maxi stopped his truck about 200 meters after passing them with the intention of seeing what would happen there- after. He put on the brakes, turned out the lights, climbed down and \"in spite of all that had happened to me, I headed toward them.\" Leaving the highway he took a path toward the three objects, since the one which had left the way open to him again had landed. Then he was able to ob- serve how the four beings were doing something in the gutter. The witness approached silently, lo- cating himself behind some bushes at a distance of about 8 or 9 meters from them. He tried to look closely at the nearest ship so as to be able to spy out some opening in it through which the beings must have been coming out and going in. But he was not able to distinguish any openings since all of it was compact and with smooth, walls. Those beings were working on the highway From his hiding place he saw how those beings were working on the embankment of the highway. For this, two tools were being used: one in the form of a capital T and the other was similar to an enormous horseshoe. In the first place they would push into the ground the one that had the form of a T, grasping it by the shaft, until it reached a depth of about 8 or 9 centimeters (about 3 inches). Then they would draw it out and push into the hole the ends of the one similar to a horseshoe. They did not remove either earth or roots. He could see the process on two occasions: \"They would take them out and they would push them in; I saw this done twice,\" he said. In spite of having the best possible conditions for being able to capture some trace of their faces, Maxi stated that no matter how much he tried he could see nothing. Appar- ently, the head was covered with the same .material which made up the rest of the garment. However, as we have already pointed out in the first observation, Maxi was intrigued by this detail. In this regard he tells us: Question: \"Did all four work with the tools?\" Answer: \"Not all of them. One would hold the tool which was like a T inverted, and another the one which was like a horseshoe; meanwhile the other two were standing there watch- ing, or at least in that attitude since they were looking to see. They had to see because they were looking.\" Maxi remained in this observing position for less than three minutes, \"which for me was a long time.\" Then he decided to retire since now fear was superior to curiosity. At no time did the beings turn towards where he was located, which perhaps indicates that they did not perceive his pres- ence in spite of the proximity. The beings were not talking nor emitting any sound. He returned to the truck, started off without difficulty and headed for Lagunilla, where he arrived visibly changed by the experience he had gone through. On the following day he explained to his employer what had happened. The latter advised him to report this to the Civil Guard, and he went there accompanied by the son of his boss. At the branch station in Lagunilla he told his story in complete detail. The officer in charge contacted head- quarters at Bejar. After three days a lieutenant from the latter station ar- rived and questioned Maxi. Then, both went to the place of the events, where they found some strange tracks. The Tracks On the highway, at the point where one of the ships had landed, they dis- covered a straight line as if the as- phalt had been scored by a very hard object. On the embankment nearby there were two scratches, produced surely by the two tools mentioned pre- viously. No matter how much they searched they could not find anything more. However, after a few days there ar- rived in Lagunilla two persons from Madrid. They said they were mem- bers of a UFO group and that they were equipped with several pieces of, apparatus. With a Geiger counter they went to the place of the events, recording radioactivity in a zone of 200 meters round about. On the other side they discovered three circles of about 12 meters (39 feet) in diameter in which the grass was knocked down; no traces of the landing gear feet were found, since the ground was very hard (during the second observation, however, the witness stated that it was drizzling). For his part, Maxi declared that on the morning following the chase he found that the battery of the truck was discharged. The electrician of the village recharged it without no- ticing anything unusual. Perhaps the young man left some light burning —6—"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"during the entire night. Two Other Observations At 12:45 a.m. on Saturday, March 30, when Maxi Iglesias was in Pineda at the house of his sweetheart, Anun- cia Merino, both of them heard a strange noise. On going out to see what it was, they observed in the sky two large spotlights at about 800 or 900 meters altitude. (In the recording by our correspondent, Maxi states that it involved two ships). The spot- lights, of a very intense white light, were flying over the zone. Sweetheart, uncle also see object The fourth and final observation by our man took place in the company of two persons: his sweetheart Anun- cia and the uncle of the latter, Don Nicolas. The events occurred on a Monday at the beginning of May when Maxi went to Salamanca to be ex- amined so as to obtain a first class driver's permit. It must have been approximately 6:30 in the morning, and they had al- ready passed Valdefuentes going toward Guijuelo when Anuncia saw in the sky a strong white light which disappeared after a few seconds so rapidly that she had no time to alert her travelling companions. Several kilometers later, when there were only four or five kilometers yet to go to the main highway which would lead them to Salamanca, suddenly they saw a very strong light which was coming toward them at a very high speed. Anuncia burst into tears since it appeared that the light was going to crash into them. It was a ball of white light, brilliant and blinding, which prevented one from looking directly at it. When it was some hundreds of meters from the vehicle, the light changed its di- rection, passing over the car and be- ing lost from sight behind them. Since at this precise moment the auto was climbing up a small hill, they believed that on getting to the top they would be able to observe where the light in question was going. But when they looked, it had already disappeared, not even a trace of it being perceived. The witness reaffirms his belief that they did not see any shape. The impression that the three witnesses felt was very strong, since they de- layed several minutes to calm them- selves before continuing their trip to Salamanca. Conclusions As the reader will have been able to observe, this story suffers from some obscure points ... This is due to the fact that the witness Maxi Iglesias went off to military service shortly after the interview with our correspondent Sr. Vincente Rico Gil. With this in mind, on receiving his cassette recording, we sent to him a complete questionnaire with the pur- pose of clarifying doubtful aspects. Unfortunately, the young man al- ready was at camp, a fact which has made it difficult to complete this article. In spite of this when we re- ceive new facts we will duly inform our readers. In regard to the material at our command, we will point out several interesting details which require comment. The first and most important is to make reference to the little or no fear experienced by Maxi throughout the two principal observations. Above all we must remark that to no one— and less to a young man of 21 years is it pleasant to confess that he had been afraid. And this will be more serious in a Latin country. However, paying close attention to the first interview carried out—the one by the announcer from Radio Bejar—we discover how at the end of this one Maxi confesses without ambiguities: \"There is no need to go on about bravery: before, I did not know what fear was, but now indeed I know what it is.\" In the same way, Maxi's tone of voice is more secure in the interview with Sr. Gil—made two months after the events—then in the one with the radio announcer, made a very few days afterward. Very tightly linked with the fore- going stands out Maxi's boldness on daring two times, and when theoretic- ally the danger had .passed, to stop and climb down from the vehicle in order to see what was gping on. And this boldness was very much related to the profession of the witness: a truck driver. Another interesting aspect and one which is evidence in favor of the truthfulness of the story, consists of his evident preoccupation with not having seen their faces. Throughout both recordings Maxi stands his, ground on this in an insistant tone. On the other hand this is clarified when reference is made to \"They are looking to see; they have to be seeing because they are looking.\" Maxi might have been able to explain that the beings had no faces, although without making reference so insist- ently to the specific detail. Very similar is the problem of the sudden appearances and disappear- ances of the beings on entering and leaving the ship. Let us recall that the first thing that Maxi did when he was spying on the four persons was to look closely at the body of the UFO so as to discover any type of opening that might explain this incongruity. Finally, among the aspects not too clear are the following: he did not say. anything to his family about what happened;, how is it possible that three tracks should exist in the field if only two ships landed in it; as well as details referring to the beings, the ships, the tracks, the investigation conducted by the Civil Guard. We do not wish to end this article without again giving thanks to Sr. Vicente Rico Gil for his investigation work on the site. A REVISED COSMOLOGY By Merrill B. Taylor How can UFOs make sharp, right angle turns, or instantaneous stops and reversals? How can they fly at speeds of 3-4,000 m.p.h., and yet fail to create sonic booms? This booklet presents a revised cosmology in which these \"im- possible\" phenomena might not be impossible. Physics says that these phenom- ena cannot happen. But they do happen, • as attested by many thousands of observers. RE- VISED COSMOLOGY explains how they CAN HAPPEN! Price $3.00, postage paid from: 1309 Broadway Dept.

I came to the edge of a sparse forest, and saw a Citroen type car approaching in front of me. When it was approximately twenty meters away it suddenly stopped making the humming sound of a car. I was a bit surprised, because I thought the driver had switched off the motor. The car went on silently for a few meters and then it parked on the side of the road. \"I was only a few meters away when I saw two persons getting out of the car: a man, who was the driver, This is the first photo allegedly taken of the \"goldish thing\" by Mr. Jorma Viita on June 22,1974, at Odense, Denmark. and a woman. Suddenly she said something and pointed her finger towards the sky. I looked up in the di- rection where she was pointing. \"Then I saw a goldish thing coming from behind my back. I stopped my bike at once. I had a camera holder around my neck and my camera was loaded with film. I took the first pic- ture of the UFO when it made a gen- tle curve. I waited for a moment and then took the second picture, but at this moment the UFO was already MUFON international coordinator Joe Brill has attempted to contact two of the three additional witnesses in this case—the German couple living in France —hot has been unable to do so because of strikes in France which have affected postal and telephone services.

It seemed to me .that the UFO was shrinking, but in reality it was speeding up. I walked over to the other witnesses and asked them if they had seen the same thing. A third person had also come out of this car. \"I noticed that the car had French plates on it. I asked them if they spoke any Danish and the driver ans- wered that he could speak Swedish. The man and the woman were Ger- mans who were living in Paris, France. The third person was a young Japanese boy. He was spending his summer holidays in Europe. They all agreed that they had seen the same UFO. \"The woman seriously panicked. She said she felt dizzy and ready to vomit. The others were all right. \"The driver told me that the motor had suddenly stopped running. The Japanese boy had a cassette tape re- corder on the back seat and it too stopped. We discussed the matter for a long time and came to the conclu- sion that the UFO had probably caused both the failures. \"The Japanese boy told me that late at night one day in August of 1973 a UFO flew over the city of Toyama. There had been at least 400 witnesses. There had also been car failures and electricity problems. The Germans, as well as the Japanese boy, had no time to stay in Denmark, although I would have wanted them to testify for me.

I don't know why I have been given the honor of seeing these UFO's so often. I don't know how I could prove these things. I have heard that persons like me have been interviewed under hypnosis. I am ready to accept this challenge. \"The UFO we saw looked like a round craft. However, the pictures show it as a flat one. We all had dif- ferent opinions about the shape. The German estimated its flying altitude to be 600 meters, the Japanese boy's estimate was 400 meters and the woman thought the UFO was only 60 meters above the ground. My own estimate was anywhere from 200 to 250 meters. \"The color of the UFO was goldish yellow, but a strong sphere of green could be seen surrounding its bottom. We could also see some sort of win- dows, but we never saw the whole of its bottom. \"The time between my two shots was about two seconds. Our observa- tion time was a little less than a min- ute.

Yes!; and direc- tor of the UFO computer program at the University of Colorado, was inter- viewed on St. Louis KMOX radio the evening of Sept. 27. On the question of predicting fu- ture waves of UFO reports, Saunders suggested the next one should occur around December of 1977, at about 60 degrees ease longitude—possibly around Moscow or Persia. He ex- plained that extrapolation of this sort is made possible by examining the approximately 5-year cycle of such waves over the past 30 years (be- ginning in 1947). Asked for his opinion of the nature and origin of UFOs' Dr. Saunders replied: \"... I don't think UFOs are any one thing. I think that some of them, per- haps, are visiting us from a great dis- tance; some of them, perhaps, are visiting us from a very short distance, but in a direction that we haven't been thinking of... \". . . We're accustomed to thinking in ordinary three dimensional space . . . but if we were to think for a mo- ment of four or five dimensional space, then something could be com- ing from a very short distance in that fourth or fifth dimension . . . that's another kind of possibility.. .\"I Frozen bodies from saucer al950'shoax Through the dubious efforts of a retired University of Southern Flor- ida instructor, the old, old undocu- mented and discredited story of a crashed UFO, the finding of 12 bodies, and the \"deep-freezing'' of those ; bodies by the Air Force has been pub- . licized again. Robert Carr, who apparently was attempting to generate interest in a symposium Nov. 1-3 in Tampa, Fla., told the story on radio talk shows in California and Florida. The story was apparently first widely publicized in the early 1950's in a book by Frank Skully, who seem- ingly was taken in by a hoax. Skully lived to regret his involvement with the story, but Carr has apparently found that it still creates a certain amount of interest. Many listeners to Carr's radio talk shows got the impression that the case was a current one, rather than one which supposedly took place in 1948. The press accounts concerning Carr's speculations have varied a great deal, disagreeing on whether the alleged case took place in Cali- fornia's Mojave Desert or near Aztec, N.M.; whether the space vehicle crash-landed or made a soft landing; and even whether there were two vehicles or only one. A quick check of responsible UFO groups indicates that not one .takes the case seriously, despite the fact that Carr has publicly claimed a long- time affiliation with NICAP. NICAP did not even bother to note the alleged case in its highly detailed and infor- mative \"The UFO Evidence\" (1964), edited by Richard Hall.

He was referring to his elk hunting trip Friday which turned into a bi- zarre experience for him. Higdon was hunting south of Raw- lins on the north boundary of the na- tional forest about 4 p.m. Friday when his \"experience\" began to unfold. \"I walked down over this hill and saw five elk,\" Higdon said. \"I raised my rifle and fired, but the bullet only went about 50 feet and dropped. I looked over to my right and there in the shadow was this sort of man standing there.\" Higdon said the \"man\" was about six-foot-two and weighed 180 pounds. He was dressed in a black suit and black shoes and wore a belt with a star in the middle and a yellow em- blem. He was quite bowlegged and had a slanted head. His forehead and facial features were similar to hu- mans but he had no chin. His hair was thin and stood straight up on his head, Higdon said. \"He asked me if I was hungry and I said yes,\" Higdon said, \"So he tossed me some pills and I took one. I don't know why I did it — I never take pills of any kind unless a doctor pre- scribes them, not even aspirin.\" Higdon said the \"man\" then pointed what resembled a long finger at him and the next thing he knew he was in a seven by seven foot cubicle with two \"men\" and the five elk. \"He asked me if I wanted to go with him and I said 'yes', Higdon said. \"I told my wife a long time ago, when these stories about UFO's and strange creatures were coming out, that if I ever got a chance, I would talk with them or go with them.\" Higdon said the \"men\" placed a hel- met on him with a strap around his neck. Six wires were sticking out from it on three sides, Higdon said. The \"men\" then told him they were going \"home\" which was 163,000 miles away. \"In no time we arrived at this tall tower similar to a rotating restaurant like the Seattle Space Needle,\" Hig- don said. \"The lights there were so intense and hurt my eyes a lot and the \"men\" said our sun affects them in the same way.\" Higdon noted that the \"men\" were never in the sunlight but always in the shade. Because the light was so intense on his eyes, Higdon said the \"men\" said they would take him home. \"The next thing I remember is talk- ing to Roy Fleming on the radio,\" he said. Fleming is manager of the Mad- dox Well Service and Higdon is em- ployed by AM Well Service of River- ton. \"My truck was about three miles from where I parked it,\" Higdon said. \"It's only a two-wheel drive and was in a mud hole where no one without a four-wheel drive would attempt to go-\"  . After Higdon was rescued by the Carbon County Sheriff's officers, he was taken to Carbon County Memor- ial Hospital for observation. \"My doctor said there were no bruises on me and I wasn't bleeding anywhere, but I'm still suffering from headaches and a backache,\" Higdon said. Higdon's wife said she and two friends went looking for her husband when he failed to return home on time and as they approached the area they saw a bright red, white and green light resembling a large star. Mrs. Higdon said it was too high for a heli- copter but too low for an airplane. Higdon said he does not drink and does not take drugs of any kind. — 10— The investigation: By R. Leo Sprinkle, Ph.D. On Tuesday, Oct. 29,1974,1 received two telephone calls: from Rick Ken- yon, art teacher in the public schools of Rawlins, Wyoming; and from Rob- ert Nantkes, vocational rehabilitation counselor of Riverton, Wyoming. Each man is known to me personally, and each is a person of high intelli- gence and integrity. The telephone calls dealt with the same topic: the UFO experience of Carl Higdon, as reported to Sue Tay- lor of the Rawlins Daily Times (Vol. LXXXVII, No. 204), Tuesday, Oct. 29, 1974. (See article preceding this re- port. ) According to the newspaper article, Carl Higdon (an oil driller for the AM Well Service of Riverton, Wyo- ming) had been hunting elk on the north edge of the Medicine Bow Na- tional Forest (40 miles south of Raw- lins) at 4:00 p.m., Friday, Oct. 25. Then, approximately at 6:30 p.m.,"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"a puzzle to investigators he called on the radio of the pickup truck which he had been driving. By talking with his boss, Roy Fleming, Carl was able to give directions about the approximate location of the pick- up truck. He said that it was parked approximately three miles from where he parked it initially; it was in a \"mud hole\" where no one would drive a two-wheel-drive vehicle. A rescue party (Sheriff Ogburn, Deputy Sheriff Ed Tierney, Roy Flem- ing, Bob Rosacker, Dave Martin, Harold Schurtz) drove several four- wheel-drive pickup trucks into the area. With difficulty, they found Carl and the truck (approximately at 11:40 p.m., Friday, Oct. 25). The truck was towed out by the four-wheel-drive trucks. Mrs. Margery Higdon, Carl's wife, was with Mr. and Mrs. Don James; they were waiting about two or three miles from the area where Carl was located. During the rescue operation, they observed a flashing light for about 20 minutes—changing from red to green to white, in a pulsing pat- tern, and moving in an arc which was described as \"three feet,\" at arm's length. When Carl was found, he was de- scribed as dazed and confused; he had difficulty in talking and recognizing his wife. He said he was taken to Car- bon County Memorial Hospital, ap- proximately at 2:00 a.m., Saturday, Oct..26, for observation, and released around 10:00 a.m., Monday, Oct. 28. During his hospitalization, Carl said that the physician, Dr. Tongca, had X-rays taken. Carl was told that the films were OK. (However, he had been hospitalized for \"TB\" at one time in Kimball, Nebraska. Chest X-rays in 1958, and 1970, had indicated there were scar tissues on his lungs, according to a Kimball physician.) During his recent hospitalization, a nurse, Ms.. Ella Petterson, told Carl Jhat he was \"OK,\" and his blood was \"OK\"—in fact, it was \"super,\" \"very jrich.\" i Carl is hopeful that information can be obtained from medical personnel which will support these statements. However, the Sheriff has made some public statements which raise ques- tions about his acceptance of the report. Kenyon said he had interviewed Carl Higdon and obtained the basic description of his experience, plus some drawings of the \"man.\" Carl had agreed to other interviews, plus the use of hypnotic techniques, for the purpose of obtaining further informa- tion about his experience. On Saturday, Nov. 2, Nantkes and I met with Kenyon, who had arranged an afternoon appointment with Carl Higdon at his home. From approxi- mately 1:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m., we talked with Mr. and Mrs. Higdon, their children, and several relatives about their reactions to the events of Oct. 25. The pendulum technique and other hypnotic procedures were uti- lized to obtain more information from Carl about his UFO experience. Then, on Sunday, Nov. 17,1974, Ken- yon and I talked with Carl Higdon, his wife and children, from 11:30 a.m. to 1:00 p.m., including an hour of hyp- notic procedures. Also present for a short period was Mrs. Marilyn James, who described her reactions to the experience of observing a flashing green-red-white light over the area where Carl was waiting for the res- cue party. During the interviews, photographs were taken of the map area (Section 5,87 West, T14 North) where Carl had been elk hunting. Also, photographs were taken of the bullet which Carl had retrieved and placed in his can- teen pouch. He was willing to release the bullet, so that Dr. Walker, APRO Consultant, might examine it. How- ever, he asked that it be returned after the examination. Carl indicated that he was willing to have his name associated with the UFO report; however, he wishes that his address be omitted from any pub- lication of the report. He believes that most people accept his story, but he wishes to prevent any \"crank\" calls. My impression of Carl Higdon is that he is a man of integrity, with average education, but a keen sense of curiosity about the world around him; he is an outdoors man and seems to have developed good skills of estimating size and distance. Although the sighting of a single UFO witness often is difficult to evaluate,, the indirect evidence sup 1 ports the tentative conclusion that Carl Higdon is reporting sincerely the events which he experienced. Hope- fully, further statements from other persons can be obtained to support the basic statement. 1973 MIDWEST UFO SYMPOSIUM PROCEEDINGS \"MUFON—A Dynamic Scien- tific Organization\" presented by Walter H.

Dains Arrived at Carbondale, Pa., approx- imately 10:30 a.m. Nov. 11, 1974. Checked in with acting Police Chief Dottle. He explained to me that three teenage boys had reported seeing a object fall from the southern sky and land in a sump pond just at the edge of town. The object was estimated to be in 7 to 8 feet of water and about 20 feet off the north shore. The pond in which the object landed has a very loose bottom, thus recov- ery had to be done with extreme care. Chief Dottle said that the police tried to recover the object Sunday morning with a net attached to a pole. It was at this time that the light went out. This led to the assumption that the object had been covered with silt. Officer Mark Terella, who made the attempt to recover the object, stated that he believed the object to be about two feet in diameter. He said he also had the impression that the object was attached to something larger. I asked Chief Dottle if we could use SCUBA Divers. He said, \"No, its too dangerous and I won't take the re- sponsibility for having someone hurt or killed!\" I then asked if we could drain the pond. He said he would check with the owner and he was sure there would be no problem. After ob- taining permission, I was escorted to the scene. Upon arrival at the scene I was very impressed with the professional- ism the CAP (Civil Air Patrol) showed. They had set up an entry point and sealed off the rest of the area as best they could. After enter- ing the area we proceeded to take Geiger counter readings and magne- tometer readings, all with negative results. I also took water samples. By this time the press and specta- tors had started to come in. We man- aged to interview Bernard Gillott, age 17, of 123—42nd St., Carbondale. He was one of the first to observe the glow in the water, which he described as an amber color with a bright white center. We then found Jim Brano of 117 Spring St., Carbondale. He was one of the original two who were first on the scene. Jim. was summoned by the three boys who saw the object fall. He estimated that 15 minutes had elapsed from the time the boys saw the object fall to the time he was called. He described the glow as a light yellow with a diameter of about 5 feet. The light seemed to pulsate. Jim said that it took about 5 minutes to complete a cycle. Very bright to very dim. He left about 7:30 p.m. and re- turned at 11:30 p.m. Jim said that dur- ing that time the light appeared to have moved from the position which he first observed it. The crowd had now become very intense. We were able to locate Jerome Gillott, Jr., who took photos of the light. He gave us the time, F stops, etc., which he used while photographing the light. This will be sent when we obtain the photos. Now the newsmen and spectators were all over. We were unable to lo- cate another witness at this time. At approximately 12:30 p.m. the Carbon- dale Fire Co. started pumping pro- cedures. A backhoe was also used to dig a dranage canal at the south end of the pond. Operations were terminated by 2:30 p.m. when Chief Dottle decided to use a SCUBA diver for recovery. The diver, Mark Stamey, from Auburn, N.Y., recovered a railroad lantern which was in the on position and very dim. Officer Terella, who made the first attempt of recovery on Sunday, stated (in strict confidence) that the lantern wasn't what he had in the net. At 3:30 p.m. the other investigators and myself had a conference. We went over the day's events. I learned 'from Matt Graeber, of UFORIC, that John Lloyd, age 14, and his brother Bill were two of the original three witnesses who saw the object falling. According to Matt, John Lloyd de- scribed the object as having a trail- ing edge which looked like a sparkler. The front of the object appeared to be a yellowish red with no definite out- line. John didn't see the object hit the water. When asked about any odor in the air, he said, \"Yes, like a gas stove.\" I plan on interviewing John and his brother this week. I also hope to talk to Bob Gillette, the third witness. When these interviews are complete I will forward same. There have been other reports that the lighted area was bubbling when the police arrived and that one of the officers shot at it. We are unable to confirm this.

As mentioned in a previous column, most of these really aren't worth the time it takes to read them. The exceptions are, of course, such v publications as ENQUIRER and TATTLER. The Oct. 22 issue Of ENQUIRER told of August UFO sightings in New Hampshire and included transcripts of tape recordings by policemen as they were viewing the UFOs. In the Nov. 12 issue, ENQUIRER featured some September sightings from var- ious Oregon towns. The Oct. 27 issue of INSIDER con- tained two articles of interest. One consisted largely of excerpts from Raymond Fowler's recent book; the other told of shoot-outs with UFOs and quoted N.C. researcher George Fawcett. TATTLER presented an article on the Falkville, Ala., \"occupant\" photo in its Nov. 24 issue. There is now speculation that the incident involv- ing police chief Jeff Greenhaw may have been a hoax. This issue of TATTLER also gives a few brief comments on UFOs by Margaret Mead, as a sort of follow-up to her recent article on the subject in REDBOOK. The December issue of SAGA con- tains an excerpt from Charles Ber- . litz's recent book, THE BERMUDA TRIANGLE. Although a great deal of the mystery surrounding the \"Tri- angle\" area may well have been \"manufactured,\" it is hard to deny that some very odd things apparently do take place there at times. The Ber- litz book will be reviewed in a future column. The February issue of MALE is scheduled to contain an article about the many UFOs allegedly seen over the years at the small town of Cal- vert, Texas. The Winter issue of SAGA UFO REPORT should also be available on the newsstands by the time.this col- umn appears. R. Michael Rasmussen, editor of THE UFO REPORTER, has recently compiled a ufo bibliography which may be obtained from him (at P.O. Box 2656, La Mesa, CA 92041) for $1.00. This is a 21-page listing of various books on the UFO subject, giving brief details of each book's contents. This is not an all-inclusive list, of course, but if you have friends who want to know what is available in the way of UFO literature, this would be a very good publication for them to examine. It is also interesting to check through the bibliography and determine just how much of the liter- ature you have actually read. Dr. Frank Salisbury's long-awaited book, THE UTAH UFO DISPLAY, is now available from The Devin- Adair Company, 1 Park Ave., Old Greenwich, Conn. 06870. The price is $7.95. The book deals largely with sightings of UFOs which have oc- curred since 1956 in the Uintah Basin area of Utah, the author's home state. Thanks to the research efforts of Joseph Junior Hicks of Roosevelt, Utah, Dr. Salisbury was able to in- vestigate the activity in the Uintah Basin and interview some of the many UFO witnesses. The sighting data are most interesting and contain some familiar descriptions. Dr. Salisbury's comments and spec- ulations as to the nature of UFOs and their possible motivations are also of interest, although it seemed to me that he was a bit ambivalent at times. He also has some of his facts a bit mixed up and seems to display an uri- familiarity with much of the previous UFO literature. While I am all in favor of scientists (Dr. Salisbury is a biologist at the State University of Utah) writing books on UFOs, I feel that they—of all people—owe it to their readers to present the facts re- sponsibly. Nevertheless, I did find the book well worth' reading. THE UTAH UFO DISPLAY contains photos, drawings of the UFOs de- scribed in the text, and various tables containing details of all the reports in Mr. Hicks' files, astronomical data, etc. There is also a foreword by Dr. J. Allen Hynek. I admit to haying mixed feelings about a new book of Jacques Bergier and the editors of INFO JOURNAL. The title, EXTRATERRESTRIAL INTERVENTION: THE EVIDENCE, is somewhat misleading, although it may be appropriate. The majority of the book's material comes from arti- cles in various issues of INFO JOUR- NAL, with a few new contributions by Bergier. The INFO data are excellent and certainly well worth your atten- tion. From UFOs in colonial New England to a half-million-year old \"sparkplug,\" this collection of articles on various mysteries will hold your interest. The book is divided into four sec- tions—\"Vanished Civilizations\"; \"Ex- traterrestrial Beings Among us\"; \"Strange Creatures\"; and, \"Fortean Phenomena.\" Perhaps the most an- noying part of the book is Bergier's marked anti-UFO bias, as well as his penchant for telling his readers to have an open mind, while he displays a closed one. Even so, the INFO info from Paul & Ron Willis is well worth the price. The book is available from Henry Regnery Co., 180 North Michi- gan Avenue, Chicago, IL 60601 for $7.95. . In closing, it is sad to note the death, on Oct. 14, of Otto Binder. His last book (co-authored with Max H. Flindt), MANKIND-CHILD OF THE STARS, was reviewed in last month's column. While I did not always agree with the subject matter of some of Otto's many articles, I did respect and admire him as a writer and re- searcher. His many friends will miss him. — 13—"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"r 8atafon Kecskemet HUNGARY eoofon The map of the encounters over Romania and Hun- gary includes 1.

The article was titled FLYING SAUCERS OVER BIHOR and was printed in the Aug. 20, 1968, issue of this publication. The calcu- lations were made by the UFO Circle of Bucharest to whom I am indebted for this work. The Romanian pilot, Captain Ben- jamin Gabrian, and his crew of a IL-18 commercial aircraft of the TAROM Romanian Airline have ob- served an unidentified flying object in flight and have related the follow- ing: \"The date was Aug. 19, 1968. We were flying at an altitude of 7,600 meters (24,934 feet) over the Oradea plain, just this side (Romanian side) of the Hungarian border. All at once, only one kilometer (Vz mile) to our right side, at about 300 meters above our plane, we sighted an oval-shaped object that was travelling at a high rate of speed in the opposite direction to the direction to which we were fly- ing. \"It was emitting an extremely By Joe Brill bright greenish light. The only thing I could think to do—more by virtue of professional reflexes—was to look at the dial of my wristwatch. It was exactly 8:21 p.m. (20:21 hrs.). I con- tinued to observe this luminous ob- ject for several seconds, until after a sudden increase in its velocity it van- ished out of sight to the west.\" Replying to a question, Captain Gabrian specified that the oval ob- ject remained in sight \"for about 10 to 15 seconds, sufficient, however, to determine with my crew, Alexandru Niculescu and M. Constantinescu, its approximate size. It was, as far as we could estimate, 2.5 to 3 meters in diameter as seen from our plane. \"We called in on the radio to the Vienna airport, from where we had taken off, to report our observation. We inquired if there were any other aircraft flying in our vicinity, which we might encounter on our flight path. The answer was 'No, not within a range of 400 kilometers (248 miles).' \"I thought that it might have been a meteorite. Yet, meteorites follow on falling in approximately vertical lines, while the object we observed traveled along in a perfect horizontal line. Then, there was that dazzling greenish light, emanating from it in flight which left no doubt about the existence on board that cosmic space- ship (if I may be permitted to call it that) of an artificial light source, re- sembling that emitted by a voltaic arc. \"A few minutes after our communi- cation with the airport in Vienna, the airport at Budapest informed us that the crew of a plane belonging to the Hungarian MALEV Airline company reported that, only two and a half minutes after our observation of this UFO, a strange object had passed nearby to their plane and that the ob- ject was coming from the east and heading west.\" Considering the distance between Oradea and the point where the ob- ject was observed for a second time its speed could be calculated at 14,000 kilometers (8,694 miles) per hour.

John Miller took the steel sphere to Lantana, Fla., for an investigation by the National Enquirer newspaper to determine its origin, since it definite- ly appeared to be foreign space debris. After the Olie Wagner family had not heard anything from the National En- quirer they demanded that the sphere be returned to them since it had fallen on their property. About a week later, Steve Kenney returned the ball to Mr. Wagner, since the National En- quirer had apparently completed its identification as to its origin. On Oct. .23, 1974, Lt. William G. Baker, U.S.A.F. from Wright-Patter- son AFB, Dayton, Ohio, arrived at the Olie Wagner home with written in- structions to pick up the steel sphere so that it might be returned to the country of origin. Lt. Baker gave Olie Wagner a copy of a 1967. treaty which commits the United States to return such items that fall on our soil to the country of origin. Olie Wagner re- fused to give up the .steel ball until he consulted his. attorney, Paul Thei- sen, who recommended that he com- ply with the Air Force instructions and the treaty. Don Jenkins, MUFON Field Investi- gator in Tarzana, Calif., and an aero- space engineer employed by Rocket- dyne, suggested the following pos- sible applications of the steel sphere when he compared it to similar uses by the United States: \"It would seem probable that the sphere recovered was a high pressure propellant tank, probably fuel of an amine type. I suggest smelling a sample of unsymmetrical dimethyl hydrazine (UDMH) or hydrazine to see if the odor is similar to that smelled after recovery. The second possibility is that it was the oxidizer tank, possibly redfuming nitric acid or nitrogen tetraoxide. A third case might be a pressure bottle, but that wouldn't smell unless some propel- lant blew back into the system. The tank also seems Russian, judging from the crude weld seam and lack of vendor tag or part number.\" Jenkins supplied a copy of a cross- sectional view of a typical pressure tank used on our space probes. The Lowell sphere is identical to these drawings. Spickler saw four of these U.S.A. spheres on display at the space museum of the Smithsonian Institute in Washington, D.C. recently, and is satisfied that they are the same as the Lowell sphere. The National Enquirer found out that NORAD had predicted a debris fall on Ohio from a Russian satellite. From a source available to MUFON the satellite decay prediction was NORAD's Catalog Number: 7389, Sat- ellite: 74459A, Source: USSR (Rus- sia), Name: COSMOS 669 Payload, and the estimated decay date was Sept. 7, 1974. Actually this particular satellite No. 7389 decayed on August 8,1974, per the same MUFON source. Sept. 7, 1974 was the actual decay date of two other Russian satellites, Catalog Numbers 7423 and 7397. These two were identified as 74-068A and 74- 032A; the first being COSMOS 674 Payload and the second COSMOS 654 Debris. Since it was a daytime re- entry, it is unlikely that it would have been reported by anyone in the air or from the ground except for the sonic boom which was reported in the im- mediate area. Only the Russians could be reasonably certain whether the steel ball (pressure tank) was from COSMOS 674 or COSMOS 654. Andrus comments, \"When one con- siders the number of people who vol- unteered their time, efforts and per- sonal expenses to identify this pres- sure tank, and the reasonable scien- tific techniques applied, we can be very proud of every MUFON mem- ber involved from the east to the west coast. Commendations and congratu- lations to each of you for a job well done, including those of you who must remain anonymous.\" (Continued} craft of the U.S.S.R. which at an alti- tude of 80,000 meters '262,467 feet) has achieved a speed of 7,850 kil- ometers (4,875 miles) per hour under ultra special conditions. This per- formance was achieved under condi- tions of a low density of the atmos- phere as well as the craft having been constructed of temperature proof alloys and making use of a huge tractive power. In the Oradea case the phenomena was successively observed by two separate airline crews belonging to two different airline companies, ex- cluding the possibility of a misobser- vation; and also excluded is the pre- sumption that the crews had hallu- cinatory states or they would not have been competent enough to esti- mate the cross country flight peri- meters. According to the study undertaken by the UFO Circle of Bucharest the UFO observed over the Oradea plain was coming'from a direction opposite to that of the plane, i.e. about SEE- NWW, decreasing its own speed on meeting the Romanian aircraft, and then changing direction to directly west, instantaneously increasing its velocity. If the velocity decrease on en- countering another flying object raises problems of intentionality and if the change of direction according to a perfect broken line and the in- stantaneous acceleration raise enig- matic problems within Newtonian physics, then the scientific implica- tions are major ones. In addition to an intelligent hand in the directing of UFO's, one remarks an irrational (at least to us) piloting skill. -15-"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"PSI releases photo of UFO passage Researchers at Project Starlight International's (P.S.I.'s) scientific data detection, monitoring, and sig- nalling site in the hill country 15-20 miles northwest of Austin, Texas, have reportedly taken a photograph of the passage of an unidentified fly- ing object over their research site at 8:55 p.m., Wednesday, Oct. 2. The photo shows the strange sine- wave path often reported in UFO ob- servations. (However, P.S.I. Research Director Ray Stanford cautions that this particular effect might, conceiv- ably, be due to atmospheric insta- bility.) But, most importantly, it clearly records two high speed, 90 degree turns made by the yellow- white object. Analysis of the photo by P.S.I, pro- fessional staff members Stanford and Samuel H. Young (formerly LOOK photo editor) yields the evaluation that no known man-made satellite or aircraft could have performed the maneuvers recorded. If, as seemingly atmospheric ef- fects on the object's light apparently confirm, the object was moving out- side the Earth's denser atmosphere, the angular velocity (visually esti- mated at 3 degrees per second) dur- ing its two 90 degree (right angle) turns suggest those turns may have been made in excess of 10,000 miles per hour. There were seven known witnesses to the passage of the Oct. 2 UFO over the research site. The photo was re- corded in Tri-X film via a 300 milli- meter (focal length) telephoto lens using 35 mm film. While the sky was exposed on film perhaps 10 seconds, the UFO's pas- sage before its light instantly cut off was exposed only an estimated 2 to 4 seconds, during which the entire path and two turns were made. The cam- era was stabilized on a heavy-duty tripod. The UFO was filmed near the zenith, approaching from southwest. \"The photo demonstrates,\" the pro- ject director said, \"That UFO's are not so illusive and as difficult to get data on as some people have ima- gined. We only regret not having had a sensitive magnetometer and other instruments set up to obtain other hard data. That must wait a while until our P.S.I, lab is complete. \"For now, the fact that such ob- jects, whatever their origin, can make 90 degree turns at high speeds, coupled with other data collected over the years, should cause scien- tists worldwide to at least probe the aspects, technological and physical, of such objects and events. It is in the interest of reporting our research results to laymen and scientists, alike, that we release this first photograph- ic result of a full year's,observation, detection, and recording efforts at the P.S.I, site.\" (Technical note: Distortion of star trails in UFO tracking photo is due to motion of camera after UFO light ceased (upper left) before camera shutter was closed.)

Ann Slate reveals that low-level un- identified flying objects reportedly seen for almost 10 years on the Yak- ima Indian Reservation, Wash., have been monitored recently by scientific instruments and photographed. - Bill Vogel, staff fire control officer stationed at the reservation, in 1971 first called the sightings to the atten- tion of Dr. J. Allen Hynek, astronomer and director of The Center for UFO Studies. Hynek asked electronic engineer David Akers to check into the re- ported UFO activity. Akers, equipped with instruments from Precision Monitoring Systems, San Diego, de- signed to obtain magnetic, spectro- graphic and photographic data, be- gan an investigation. Akers' efforts became \"the most scientifically-monitored UFO stake- out in the history of saucer investi- gation,\" reports writer Slate. \"And it's still going on. For almost a decade, one rectangular section of some 2,800 square miles . . . has been a hot-bed of reported continued UFO ac- tivity. Only no one talked about it until recently.\" For his initial field study, Akers set up six portable observation points manned from sunrise to sunset. He was not to be disappointed. At 4:15 a.m. on the first night of his stake-out, he sighted one luminous, round light. His investigative report states: \"It was joined by another similar light at 0437. They were at an eleva- tion of 10-20 degrees and well below the ridge of the hills . . . The objects were apparently round, with a red- dish-orange glow . . . The light flick- ered noticeably . . . They appeared to move independently, circling and changing places in relation to one another —\" On almost every evening of his observations, Akers had observed UFOs: red lights which sweep back and forth over the terrain ahead of them using an amber beam as if searching for something; luminous orange balls hovering and blinking near the base of hills; intense white lights moving so fast they gave the impression of a white streak before stopping and darting in another di- rection. Akers has also studied data re- corded by fire control officer Vogel. One particularly dramatic incident reportedly happened to the 11-year-old son of a woman who runs one of the reservation's cigarette stores. \"The boy had walked to the mail- box to get the afternoon mail,\" Slate states, \"when an object he described as 'big as a large airplane, gray in color, silent and shaped like a plate' came over him. Terrified, he ran for his minibike and headed ... to his grandmother's house for safety. As he looked back... the huge craft was fol- lowing at a low altitude. The boy stopped his bike and ran into the heavy brush at the side of the road in an effort to hide. The vehicle moved slowly over the brush for a time as if searching for him. Then it shot away.\" Following the incident, the boy was very nervous and tense, and spoke of the object for the next several days. In his report, Akers summarizes his findings: \". . . genuine UFO activity has been and is still taking place on a more or less regular basis in the Toppenish area (of the Yakima Res- ervation). Dr. Hynek comments: \"The investi- gation served to establish the reality of the phenomena but increased the frustration by not being able to do a proper job.\" To accomplish the \"proper job\" to which Hynek refers would require at least one full-time specialist to be stationed permanently in the area with additional equipment. Akers has only been able to spend limited time on the project. UFO sightings are continuing, mak- ing additional research extremely promising. One of the most recent is documented in official Police Depart- ment Report No. 930-74, which lists the subject as \"Possible U.F.O.\" \"This ... sighting by three persons,\" writes Slate, \"concerns a mass of lights which not only .moved erratic- ally up, down and forward, but which followed their car along a reservation ridge. If the auto sped up, so did the multi-colored lights, oscillating in a circle around a darkened nucleus .body. Then ... the UFO moved away. This occurred in August of 1974.\" COPYRIGHT 1974 SKYIOOK, MUFON merger delayed The previously announced merger of SKYLOOK and MUFON, which was to have been effective Jan. 1,1975, has been delayed indefinitely. Commenting on the delay, SKY- LOOK Publisher Dwight Connelly said, \"Plans made some weeks ago have just not jelled, for a number of reasons. One reason is the fact that MUFON's impending reorganization is still in the process of being worked out, making MUFON's future de- cision-making structure an unknown at this time. It is difficult to make concrete plans and commitments until the reorganization is complete. \"A second factor is the expected in- crease in the workload at MUFON headquarters as a result of expected TV publicity and possible governmen- tal announcement concerning the UFO phenomenon. The new MUFON office secretary has simply not had time to adjust yet,, and it would not be fair to MUFON members or SKY- LOOK readers to add the many duties involved in publishing the magazine onto an inexperienced person.\" Connelly announces that the sub- scription price for SKYLOOK will increase to $8.00 per year, beginning Jan. 1, rather than the previously an- nounced $10.00 per year. — 17—"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"Director's Message By Walt Andrus It is with extreme pride that we announce the appoint- ment of Leonard H. Stringfield to the MUFON Board of Directors position of Director for Public Relations. Len, who resides with his wife, Dell, and fourteen-year-old daughter, Camille, at 4412 Grove Avenue, Cincinnati, Ohio 45227, telephone AC 513 271-4248 (home) and AC 513 762-6965 (business), has been serving since 1971 as State Section Direction for Hamilton, Clermont, Warren, and Butler counties and will continue in this dual role. Len is probably best known as Director of Civilian Research, Interplanetary Flying Objects, which he founded on March 10,1954, and its bulletin, the C.R.I.F.O.'s NEWSLETTER, changing its name to C.R.I.F.O. ORBIT on July 1, 1955. (Your Director is very proud to possess copies of this publication, starting with Volume I, No. I, on April 7,1954.) In October, 1957, Leonard published his book titled \"Inside Saucer Post. .. 3^0 Blue\" that he dedicated to his first two daughters, Colette and Denise. He simply .ex- plains the book as \"CRIFO views the status quo: a Sum- mary Report by Leonard H. Stringfield.\" It is interesting to note that Ted Bloecher had suggested that the title of Len's book should be \"The Midnight Oil,\" which was typical of Leonard's UFO work during that era. Professionally, Len is Director of Public Relations and Marketing for DuBois Chemical in Cincinnati. With seventeen years of professional P.R. experience and over twenty years in the UFO field, Len is without a doubt the finest choice that MUFON could make for this important position to spearhead our public awareness program at this crucial point in UFO history..

(This column is directed towards articles appearing in the September, 1974, edition of SKYLOOK.) Yanco Case The Yanca case, purporting to de- scribe contact with comic-strip-like, blond-haired space people, naturally raises more questions than it an- swers. Most of all, it demonstrates the need for well-qualified psychia- trists and psychologists in UFO in- vestigation. One wonders how these beings can have a \"similarity . . . truly astonish- ing\" to the spacemen described by the Hills unless something has been lost (or distorted) in the translation. The little details conforming to other occupant cases (drawing off electri- cal energy, silvery suits, humming conversation, levitation, interest in physiology ... ) raise this immediate question: How much, or how little, was Yanca familiar with UFO liter- ature and lore? - Casitas Dam Photo The 1974 photograph of the UFO emerging from the lake, once again, leads us to questions about the wit- ness; not intended to be cynical, necessarily, but important to thor- ough investigation. Why did Mr. Kin- sey take along binoculars and camera on a casual visit to a dam on a cloudy, drizzly day? And why infra-red film, which is not used in normal photog- raphy? Was this a fresh roll of film, and the first picture taken on it? No mention is made of photographing the dam or other scenery. Top-shaped UFOs I find reports of \"top-shaped\" UFOs intriguing, and one of the many cross- cultural problems of UFO investiga- tion that I hope Joe Brill and his colleagues can help to elucidate. The November 8, 1973 top-shaped UFO seen by pilots over Bolivia was ap- proached within about 2000 meters by the Air Force pilot. On May 5, 1958, a pilot over San Carlos, Uruguay, saw a UFO \"shaped like a child's top approach and hover about 2000 meters away, but the pilot was able to close in to about 700 meters before the UFO shot away (see The UFO Evidence, p. 120). The question is, what shape-is a child's top in Bolivia and Uruguay? Even in the U.S. there is some varia- tion, but the classic top is conical on the bottom and rounded on the upper surface. Some are flatter and more disc-like than others, and some have more pronounced rims or flanges than others. Roger Shepard's array of UFO shapes appearing on page 229 of the 1968 Congressional \"Symposium on Unidentified Flying Objects\" in- cludes several . distinctly different forms that could be described as \"top-like.\" This general configuration, of course, and its relationship to ro- tating or spinning UFOs, may be more than coincidental. —20-"}]
