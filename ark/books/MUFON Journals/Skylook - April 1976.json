Schroth St. Louis/Mass Media John F. Schuessler UFO Propulsion Norma E. Short Editor-Publisher Emeritus Len Stringfield Commentary Editor's Column It has come to our attention that Dr. J. Allen Hynek of the Center for UFO Studies has stated to the press that the editor of Skylook has a \"per- sonal vendetta\" going against him. Not true. It is a fact, of course, that Skylook has pointed out what we feel are some of the unfortun- ate activities and attitudes on the part of Dr. Hynek and the Center. Dr. Hynek apparently feels he should be beyond such criti- cism, although he has not been reluctant to criticize others-- often unfairly and without ap- parent purpose. Actually, Dr. Hynek has been getting a great deal of criti- cism in recent months, both privately and publicly, most of it far more severe than any- thing Skylook has printed. The May issue of OFFICIAL UFO is one example. For two years this editor has tried to be a moderate as more and more MUFON members be- came increasingly 'critical of Dr. Hynek and his definition of cooperation. Some of these MUFON people, including two members of the Board of Direc- tors, have resigned, at least partly because of their objec- tion to MUFON's continued close association with Dr. Hynek. Other members have been just as critical, but have remained in the organization thus far. Dr. Hynek's claim to fame is that he is currently the best- known name in ufology. In our opinion he does not deserve this fame--which has come to him primarily as a result of Air Force publicity—since he has actually done far less with far less expertise than a great many others. We have yet to see, for ex- ample, a detailed report of any case he has investigated \"sci- entifically,\" and he has obvi- ously mishandled some he has been involved with (such as Pascagoula). As an administra- tor of the Center, he is a walking organizational and pub- lic relations disaster. No, there is no vendetta. Dr. Hynek, not we, is his own worst enemy. He is, somehow, managing to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory.

God is the only one who could save . us from IT. With ITS intense heat and light, IT can do whatever. IT wants to.\" When Mona Stafford tells you she and two other local women saw and perhaps came under the power of an unidentified flying object (UFO) early last month, it's difficult not to' believe her. Her voice still trembles when she talks' about the incident, and the swollen dark area a- round her eyes gives evidence she hasn't been sleeping too well recently. The day that was to end in a night of horror for Mona and her two friends was January 6. It was Mrs. Stafford's birth- day and Louise Smith and Elaine Thomas wanted to treat her to a night out at the Redwood Res- taurant near Stanford. \"I don't get out much,\" re- marked Mrs. Stafford. \"These two girls just wanted to do something nice for me.!' The trio of Casey Countians dined at the Redwood and left the restaurant at 11:15 .that evening, Mona recalls. They drove through Stanford past the city cemetery and then the drive-in theatre and into the open countryside. The three ladies were not too far out of Stanford when they saw something that ap- peared to be fire coming down from the sky. Mona, who was sitting up front between her two friends, Th>> sketch was drawn by Mrs. Stafford. told the driver, Louise, to drive faster toward the falling object. \"It was several hundred .feet ahead\" and I thought it might be an airplane crashing,\" said Mona. • • •-'•• As they neared the area where they had seen the fire, Mona says an object as big as a house and shaped like a blimp or football started coming down the road toward them. She said the object had red lights all the-, way around it, and the lights were rotating.. \"It had a light on top that was bluish-white and more brilliant than anything I've ever ; seen,\" noted Mona; • .The object came across the road to the right of the. auto the ladies were .riding in, made a half circle .and : came \"in be- hind the car, Mrs; Stafford re- marked .'••'-- . ' ' '• ;• She said they turned to look at the object but the intensity of the lights gave all of them headaches. ' ••\"• '•' .. All .of a sudden, the trio realized that , they were no longer in control of the auto- mobile. They felt like some- thing was pulling back on the car. ' . . The speedometer on Louise Smith's car showed they were traveling at 85 mph/. .but how could that be...she didn't even have her foot on the accelera- tor, Mrs. Stafford said. \"It felt like We were cross- ing those grooves they have in the road to slow you down when you're approaching a stop sign,\" Mona recalled. Then, all of a sudden, the women found themselves- in Hus- tonville. However, they were shocked because none of them could remember traveling the area between the two towns. \"It was like something had picked us up in Stanford and set us down in Hustonville,\" Mona remarked. Mrs. Stafford\"says that when they arrived back in Liberty at Louise Smith's house, they saw it was 1:25 a.m. It had taken the women more than two 'hours, to travel to Liberty from Stan- ford, normally a 45-minute trip. Another strange thing the ;women noticed was that two of Page 3"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"them, Louise and Elaine, had burns on the backs of their necks. \"It resembled a real bad sunburn,\" Mona recalled. The women' got their neigh- bors out of bed to see the burns and to tell them about what they had seen. The neigh- bors advised them to separate and draw what they had seen. Mrs. Stafford's drawing showed a blimp-shaped object with the row of lights around it. In addition to many red lights, she said there was also one yellow light that was flashing. : \"I think that was a window because it was dimmer than all the other lights,\" she explained. The women . reported their sighting to. ..Kentucky state troopers and to the armed ser-\" vices, but for Mrs. Stafford the ordeal did not end with that. \"I don't feel -like the same person,\" noted Mona. \"This has just taken my mind over. I was. worried about all kinds- of other problems before, but this is something I just have to get a better understanding of.\" Mrs. Stafford, who says she can see the object now as plain as she did on that terror- filled night in Lincoln County, has been living with her par- ents since the incident occur- red. .  • Although she has a household of her own and a young son, she says she can't bear the thought of staying alone on nights her son might be away. Her mother, . Mrs. Ed Witt, has shared in some of the agony her daughter, who appears to be in her mid-thirties, has been experiencing. \"The first twc weeks after it happened were just terrible; it's just impos- sible to explain the fear that she showed,\" Mrs. Witt noted. Mrs. Stafford thinks she may have seen two UFOs since the incident in Lincoln County. \"My son said they were airplanes, but he couldn't explain why the lights on them went off after we started looking at them,\" she remarked. \"My ears seemed to open up Page 4 Minnesota more after the night...and it seems like I can hear things... a whirling sound I didn't hear before. It seems like I can almost hear it when it's a- round.\" The. Casey housewife, who claims she .can tell the differ- ence between the objects and a star, feels they have a way of hiding from a person who has never seen one. \"I'believe what they do is get up high enough to blend in with the .stars and come down when they want to,\" she ; said. \"I look for it now, but I don't want to see it unless it's at a distance. I might have a heart attack if- it came upon me again.\" Additional.Detail Although details are sketchy at this point, it is reported that at least one of the women experienced an unusual men- strual flow. Such an effect has been re- ported in the recent Fargo, ND, abduc- tion case on Aug. 26, 1975, (March SKY- LOOK) and in the Bethal, NM, case on Jan. 6, 1976 (same night as this case), reported in this issue of SKYLOOK. CIA photo expert dies . Harry Woo, a photoanalysis expert who testified to the Robertson Panel concerning the Navy analysis of the 1950 Mon- tana and 1952 Utah movie films of UFOs, died March 19 at the age of 65.

Woman Location: near Bethal, MM. Date: Jan. 6,1976. Type: close*encounter, possible physio- logical effects. Witness: Mrs. Janet Stewart, primary witness; partial corroboration by Mary\" Root. EDITOR'S NOTE-Following is the edited transcript of a tape recording made by Mrs. Janet Stewart of Bethal, MN, at the request of Mr. Harry Kirch- man, a field investigator for IUFOR (International UFO Registry) in Bethel. It was provided by IUFOR Director William Hauak through Joe Brill. My name is Janet Stewart. I am 29 years old, married to Kenneth Stewart, and the mother of three children, ages 11, 3 and 2. On Jan. 6, 1976, a Tues- day night, I was headed for my astrology class in Moundview. I was stopping in Cedar, a few miles away from my home to pick up a.girlfriend, a classmate of mine whose name is Mary Root. I left the house a little after 7:20 p.m., which is a little late for me, and headed down east Bethel Blvd. towards Mary's house. ~ Well, as -I came around the last curve on east Bethel Blvd. and was heading south I saw ahead of me, on the horizon, above the trees, three lights which made up one air vehicle, which at the time' I assumed to be an airplane. There' was a central red light, and on each side of this was a smaller green light. I did think the lighting arrange- ment was a little strange, but I assumed it was just my view of it that made it appear that way. Getting closer At the time I first saw it, I thought it was -going to travel across in front of me on the horizon. I thought it was moving from west to east at the time, but within just a few minutes, well, seconds really, I realized that it was getting"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"reports possible U FO effects larger and therefore deducted it was coming closer towards me. As I reached the stop sign at the end of east Bethel Blvd. and paused there, it was becom- ing quite a lot larger and now I really could see that it was not an airplane-. I assumed now that very possibly it was a helicopter. 'I paused at the stop sign and watched it for a minute and then I went ahead onto County Road' 15, still headed south. : Now'it\" began to grow much, much larger; rapidly it was coming closer to.me and I could see that the green lights on either side of the red light were blinking very, very fast-- much, much faster than any air- plane lights I'd ever seen. I still thought it could be a helicopter, possibly, and I'was now near the first curve on County Road 15, which is a very sharp 25 mile-an-hour- curve to the right; As I neared this curve, I could see that the object was beginning to drop down, sprt of slung down'into a lower posi- tion, ' and as .1 came into the curve, I was at the center of the curve when the thing ac- tually zeroed in over my hood and windshield at a bit of an angle. It instantaneously was going in the same direction as my car., even though it.had been moving in the opposite direc- tion.  ,. Now, I realized that it was not a helicopter. That NO WAY was it a helicopter. I did not have the radio on. I was wait- ing for my tapes to warm up. I usually play eight-track tapes, and they were cold because it was such a terribly cold night. It was minus fifteen degrees with a windchill factor of minus fifty degrees. In fact, I almost, stayed home because it was so cold, but I did have'iriy heater fan going: full blast and of course all my. windows were rolled up. : '*'-.- But I did-not have the radio on nor .any tapes .playing at that time.and I did not hear a sound,' even- though it was so close that I'm .sure it wasn't more than 25 feet above me, -and it may have-been as low as fif- teen feet above me. Somewhere between fifteen'to twenty feet. In that range I'm sure. The large red central light didn't blink at all; It was just a solid red light. The green lights on either side of it were blinking.There was one on each side of it that were blinking very, very fast that I didn't look at them as much as, of course, I. looked -at the whole thing. ,But I -kept .my eyes ^mainly on . the central light because it was easier on the eyes than these, blinking lights. . ..-..' ' •--• . • •• I was hunched . down -. *• • -. the seat. I was hanging, o: to the steering wheel with .my. chin pressed in towards the steering wheel so I -_..'d look' up, be- cause it was--it appcaccd right above the windshield, . and so I could get a better view of it I sort of sat in this hunched or hunched down-position\". It stayed' with me in that position all the .way.; around this curve and into the next curve, which is a left hand curve; and.then the .road curved again, to the 'left. It stayed with me around that curve\"also. Then, the.road straightens but for a time before -going ; into the next right hand curve-and it stayed with-me , along- this straight area of road, and - as I moved towards or came into the right hand curve it moved over the top of my car so that the roof of my car obscured: my view. • , ••' .- - All in all, it was with me very, .very close to a mile. I slowed to a stop as I,was.going very .slowly anyway. I'm sure I couldn't -have been .going more than twenty or .twenty-five miles-an hour, because .1 was intent upon watching the thing and-therefore I.didn't have a whole-lot of time to watch the road. I kind of varied, back and forth between - the two constantly,, the whole time it was above me. But- I .slowed to a stop and I tried to peer out the back window, .which was so thickly frosted that I couldn't see out of it at all. I really couldn't see any of the craft itself. All I ; could see were these lights. The lights didn't' give off a lot of light. The light was pretty well contained.. It just didn't give off light. I tried very hard to see if there was any- thing at all of the craft I could see behind the lights, but I can't really say I was successful. \" \"•' \"' A chrome ring? ; I'm quite' sure that I 'saw what was probably a chrome ring maybe at the bottom of one of the green lights. The one on the left hand side. Measurement wise, from green light to green light,\"' it would have been--it was larger than the car, that is, my car-from end to-end. I would say -it was probably be- tween sixteen and eighteen feet. That's'approxiamte, but it was, I am sure'as large and probably larger than my : cafv-'-- I thought I could see, at one point, a dome^shape behind the central fed' 1 light.- -I'm not sure, though, because sometimes lights will-give off kind of a black glare\" and that could have been what--it was .'-'So r really can't say : I saw -'anything of the craft itself, only these lights, but it definitely be-i haved in a way that no helicop- ter or airplane would behave. I tried to look out-the'side Page 5"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"windows. They were frosted too and I didn't have any luck there. I didn't have the pres- ence of mind to get out of the car and look to see where it had gone. Anyhow, I just.sort of gave up and started to drive on again into the right hand curve, and as I did this, a car coming from the opposite direc- tion came out from around this curve and I sort of helplessly watched it go by, thinking, gee,. I should stop them and ask them if they had seen it too. But, I couldn't figure out how to do that and then, of course, they were gone. So then I continued on. to Mary Root's home, a girlfriend of mine, who . attends classes with me and I stop and pick her up on the way. I drove as quickly as I could to her place and ran up to the door. I was very excited. On the way to the car I told her what had happened and what I had seen. She was also excited then and wanted to go back to the curve and see if we could see any- thing. So, as long as I had company, we decided that was what we would do and we went ahead and went back to the curve. Once there, we even got out of the car -and looked around, but didn't see anything at all. So.we turned around and went back out again past her place and up to highway 65, where we turned south, headed for Mound- view, where the classes are held. A red light We had ; just barely gotten going south on highway 65 when Mary noticed off to our left- hand side, the east side of the highway, just above the trees, there was a solitary, red light which she said was moving with us. I thought this was a little too much and I told her it must be a tower light. She said no, that she was very observant and that she had never seen a tower light in that place—and she drove on this highway all the Page 6 time. Well, she kept an eye on it while I was driving, so I only 'got a couple-of -glances' at it;< But she kept a very close eye on it and it stayed in the same position. In her view, she was looking out the window past me;. It stayed with us for two miles. . Now at- the -end of two miles it rose up in the air a bit and began to move, farther to the east. We could tell this because it was growing smaller. Mary wanted me to turn • ; off on an eastbound side\" road to fol- low it, and we just made a quick decision and did that and we swung off onto this east- bound road which was flanked on both sides heavily with trees. We did keep it in view most of the time. A few times''the trees blocked our view, but never for any length of time. We followed the road down as it was only a few miles long. It was a dirt road. We followed it down to where it dead ended, where a T, a tar road ^ tees a- cross it. On the other side'of the tar road, there's a field partially open and surrounded by trees. We stopped at the tar road and apparently the red light stopped 'there too, over that.field, at the edge of the trees. It stayed, there. It just stood there. Hovered there. It didn't blink.. It didn't go-up or down. It didn't go sideways, It didn't do anything : spectac- ular at all. We just stopped there and watched it. I lit a cigarette and we stayed there while I smoked the cigarette. So, it would probably have been between five and ten minutes. We even blinked our lights on and off, -but we couldn't -get any response out of this red light. So after a short time we turned and went back out to highway 65 and continued on to Moundview. As soon as we got there, ' I called my husband and told him what I had seen and I was grateful that he believed me. Anyway, , we had our class and we, of course, on the way home that night kept our eyes peeled. We didn't see anything at all. , .. The following day (Jan. 7) I ,; began having,, menstrual cramps,, which I 'thought was a little\" strange since I had only been over my last period for • six days.. I assumed it must be ovulation cramps coming a bit early and I didn't pay any at- tention, to. it. - But then, the next day, (Jan. 8), which would have been for^ ty-eight hours after the sight- ing, I came down with a full pledged period.. I just could not believe it because I have a pretty .tight. 28 to, 32-day cycle. I adhere to my schedule quite predictably. I didn't relate it to the sighting at all. That never even, crossed .ny mind. • But, I was complaining to my girlfriend, Mary Root, the same girl who had been with me that night, and low and be- hold she had had the same prob- lem.' She takes birth control pills,: so she was really amazed to say the least. Neither one of us related it to the sight- ing at all. We just complained in the usual manner, and never considered the thought, that the sighting had anything to do with it. - I was also having some eye problems, but I thought it was the dry air and the lack of humidity and the cold, and so I didn't relate that to the sighting either. The four.th day after the sighting (Jan. 10) I woke up in the \" morning , with • the realization that my • eyes were burning, even though ; they were closed and there was - matter running out of them. I got up and looked in the mirror and they were quite bloodshot. I used Visine. By about noon it. began to go away. . - . It wasn't .terribly uncomfor- table that day, but the follow- ing •• day' (Jan. 11) it was VERY uncomfortable. I woke up and the matter had collected around my eyelashes. It was .• running out of my eyes. J My eyes were like two little tail lights. I was. afraid and I cried. I thought I was going blind. I"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"Couldn't imagine what had hap- pened to my eyes, and still I did not relate it to the sight- ing, in any.way. I just couldn't imagine what was happening to my eyes. I used a lot of Visine and some of the kid's old pink- eye drops. I had to keep my hands over my eyes all morning. I couldn't keep my eyes open for even a few minutes at a time, even a few seconds at a time. . I was planning on going to the doctor that afternoon, but by about noon they did begin to clear up considerably. By shortly after noon my eyes were in much, much better condition, although still bloodshot. But as far as the discomfort, that was mostly gone. I had doctored them a lot. I used a lot of eye drops and kept them closed. So I didn't . go to the doctor. The sixth day after the sighting my eyes were returning to .normal. .. . EDITOR'S NOTE: Another close encounter case was reported the same'.day at Anoka, MN, 10-12 miles southwest of this case, involving one witness. .It was reported to the Center for UFO Studies; no additional informa- tion is available. . Another case, similar in some respects, was reported on the same night near Stanford, KY (see story elsewhere in this issue). Boyd to specialize in unexplained physics Veteran UFO investigator Robert D. Boyd of 121 Huron Rd. Mobile, AL., has informed. Sky- look that he has begun an ef- fort, \"to,specialize on the an- omalous . characteristics of UF.Os.\" . Boyd, who points out that UFOs frequently demonstrate abilities contrary to our know- ^ledge .of physical laws, feels that a concentrated effort should be made to study these apparent contradictions. He invites.specific informa- tion concerning this topic, and urges other researchers inter- ested in this area of UFO re- search to contact him. Travis Walton case Walton explains controversies EDITOR'S NOTE: The following account by Travis Walton of his experiences sur- rounding the investigation of his UFO encounter is being printed in order to give, in his own words, his version of the facts. While this account was written prior to Walton's receipt of SKYLOOK's later and more complete articles on the case, we feel Mr. Walton should have the opportunity to \"tell it like it is\" from his viewpoint. By Travis Walton I'm sure you realize that erroneous heresay and incom- plete newspaper articles are not a good source of informa- tion to judge anything by, but you did do a very unbiased ar- ticle with what information you had to go on. In your article on the Walton case in Skylook you said in conclusion, '.'If additional in- formation on this case becomes available it will be printed in Skylook.\" I would like for this\"^ letter to be used in Sky- look, and if it is, I would ask that it be printed in its en- tirety as I don't : want to be quoted out of context.. When I was returned on Nov. 10th, I was in a serious emo- tional state. At that time and for weeks -afterwards I didn't want. to. tell anyone about my experience except those close to me. I avoided the public and the media for several days. During my silence a lot of mis- information was printed. I feel much better about it all now and I would like to set the record straight. I have not read a newspaper yet, not even one, that printed exactly what I have said. The stories al- ways garble the facts and mis- quote everypne. None of the newspapers referred, to in your article actually, ever iater- viewed me. However, I don't doubt that you quoted.the news- papers correctly. I have never met or talked with Bill Spaulding .in my en- tire life, and to' my knowledge, Spaulding has never interviewed any of the crewmembers who wit- Travis Walton (photo by Michael Rogers) nessed the incident. Although much quoted in your article, Spaulding only visited the ab- duction site and talked, to my brother, <Duane, in way of in- vestigation. The real investi- gation .was carried on by the Aerial Phenomena Research Or- ganization (APRO) who conducted numerous medical, psychiatric, and hypnotic tests, as well as polygraph examinations. When I was' returned, my brother contacted 1 Spaulding whom he had met at the site. Duane asked him to arrange a complete medical, examination for. me as he was naturally con- cerned about my physical condi- tion . Spaulding directed . him to a Dr. Lester Steward . in Phoenix. As it turned out Ste- ward, was not, an M.D.,.-,as indi- cated by Spaulding,.and was un- successful in trying to get a doctor on the telephone. Duane took me back home after being there less than thirty minutes. \"Dr.\" Steward claims: a number of degrees from a university that when checked into..-by APRO, .turned out to .be. :l a, small unac- credited cprrespondence,school. Mr. Steward, .who.also claimed to be an ^,'expert .on hallucino- genic drugs, later .made allega- tions that my experience, was the result,.of L.S.D. .He didn' L t explain how. my supposed \"hallu- cination\" . .was. . snared.. by six other men.\" My blood tests that day were run., through the Mari- Poge 7"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"copa County medical examiners drug screen and revealed no trace of any drug. Mr. Steward made no examin- .ations or tests on me of any kind. I'm sure this man's little run-down Westward Ho Hotel is not Ground Saucer Watch headquarters. This was my only contact with any GSW representative. It is under- standable why I did not cooper- ate with them. APRO quickly produced two reputable M.D.s that day and continued a thor- ough investigation from then on. Bill Spaulding became neg- ative only at this point, which he refers to as noncooperation. After it was clear that he couldn't handle the case, Bill Spaulding numerous times re- ferred vaguely to \"holes\" in the story and some \"questions\" and \"other factors\" that caused him to .have \"doubts.\" Never once did he specifically state what these discrepancies were. Possibly Spaulding's ego was more at stake to him than the factuality of the case. Without consulting us, Spaulding arranged for a meet- ing with Dr. J. Allen Hynek, which was associated with GSW, which we had lost faith in by that time. Neither my brother nor myself knew enough of the UFO subject at that time to recognize Dr. Hynek as one of the foremost scientists in the field. Since then I've had direct correspondence with Hynek and have scheduled a meeting with him- The media has accused me of refusing a lie-detector test that was ordered by police. I personally requested that poly- graph-test from' Sheriff Marlin Gillespie with his promise that the media would be kept away and that it would be held in private. The day of the test the reporters were again camped on my doorstep and I was in no emotional condition to be in- terviewed at that time. As I was preparing to leave for the Department of Public Safety headquarters we discovered there were numerous television and newspaper reporters inter- Page 8 viewing the OPS examiner in the. room arranged for my test. Since .the sheriff . failed' ;to keep his word in the matter, I did not take 1 it. that day. : • , I was advised shortly there- after by APRO psychiatrists, that to have taken a polygraph test that soon would have given inconclusive results at best. The psychiatrists .said a poly- graph measures stress, not lies; therefore, to get a valid result I should wait until any reaction registered- would not be the result of emotion-packed memories.. This was borne out by the inconclusive results of the test on Allen Dalis, the crew- man who was so agitated after witnessing the incident. APRO will have Dalis retested soon. When I was calm enough, APRO arranged for- me to take, a poly- graph test from Ezell Polygraph Institute, .who does all the lie detector work for Pinal-County Sheriff's Office. The results of my test were positive. -Undersheriff.Kenneth CopIan said that I and the rest of the crew saw the NBC special, \"The UFO Incident,\" as to infer that we had made everything up be- cause of similarities in the two incidents. I did not have a TV and did not see the show. I know that v at least a couple of the others didn't see it either. (There is no such person a= Deputy Sheriff Ken Nolan as quoted by the Arizona Republic in your article.) I never said I thought I was hit over the head, I .simply described being struck by the beam as feeling like a physi- cal blow. I do riot consider myself or my family to be UFO buffs. We haven't had an overt interest in the subject or ever bought any UFO publications. My brother Duane saw a UFO about 12 years ago and we have talked about the subject on a few oc- casions since then. I myself have never had a UFO experience before this. I suppose many people' that live an outdoor' life have seen a few things in the sky they can't explain. .This doesn't make them freaks on the sub- ject. Dr. R. Leo Sprinkle told me that 15 million Americans have seen something unidenti- fied\" in the sky. Sheriff Marlin Gillespie has himself reported seeing 2 of 3 UFO's over the years, including one close en- counter. He does not, however, consider himself a UFO buff. My older brother, Duane, ,has acted as father to. our family in recent years. His expression of confidence of my return and his saying that \"I was having \"the experience of a lifetime\" was only designed to bolster my mother's confidence. My mother believed this .and the accounts of the. crewmen whom she knew. She was terribly upset by my disappearance and had to be se- dated. .This explains Duane's criticism of the investigator who said he doubted the chan- ces of my return after so much time. Due to Duane's involve- ment , - he was suspected of con- spiring with me to -' perpetrate a hoax. He took and passed a lie detector test concerning this from the same firm as I did. ; . Duane's fierce protection of me from-reporters who didn't seem to care about my condition drew much hostility from .the local media. Duane told the reporters I was . in a. Tucson hospital to get them off our backs. I.never was- -in.Tucson. All the tests were performed in Phoenix and the results are available from the 'Aerial Phe- nomena Research Organization in Tucson. My experience aboard the UFO has been just as garbled by newspapers as everything else, but I won't take the space at this time to cover all that. APRO has all the facts of the sighting 'and the \" account of my abduction experience. Anyonb can obtain this information by- reading the APRO Bulletin or calling their headquarters in Tucson.

There, were, no,- abrupt, maneuvers. Visibility was 15 miles. The object left bright white, rapidly dissipating steaks in its wake which were totally dissimilar to normal aircraft contrails. MUFON In- vestigator Raymond E.- Fowler concludes that natural, phenome- na v (such, as balloon- spider webs)' and • man-made'• objects (such as aircraft or balloons) do not fit the descriptions and conditions, •; and classifies the sighting as being in the \"un- known\" -category. Michael Rogers, one of the witnesses in the Travis Walton case, has sent SKY- LOOK a color photo of a painting he did of the UFO encounter (cover photo), as well as his comments concerning the case. Contact between Rogers and SKYLOOK was established through the cooperation of Jim Lorenzen, internation- al director of APRO. Following are Rogers'comments: \"Working from the composite descriptions of all of us, I have painted a detailed scene of what we'all saw that Nov. 5 when Travis was hit by the beam emitted from the UFO. \"The reason I did the paint-- ing is because .so many people, say we don't know what we''saw, or say we were tricked.

Local Evaluation: Significant Investigated by: J. J. Magrans, state section director of New Castle County, Delaware, from referral by Ted Bloecher. The sighting The main witness, with her 8-year-old son sitting next to her, was driving east on Dela- ware Av. at approximately 2030- 2100 hour. As she approached the intersection of Chapel Street'and slowed down for the traffic light which was red, she noticed bright illumination through her windshield. This illumination (white flourescent light) appeared to be coming from the left hand side, so she looked through her driver's window and saw \"a huge circular object.\" At this point she .stopped the car. She was the first car arriving at the intersection, but other cars were behind her and they also stopped at the light. The object was of huge di- mensions, 'by the witness's ac- count: it entirely covered the nearby lot, which is a used car sales lot. The object was grey, having a metallic look, and.. 1 was smooth. A 'dome- was visible on top which was not illuminated.• • • .The bottom of- the object had lights (white flourescent in color), not so bright as to hurt the eyes, which seemed to be -shining down' on the witness. The two extreme lights at the left and right of the object were bigger than the others. The witness did not .count the number of lights, but for the sake of illustration a set num- Poge 10 ber was indicated in the draw- ing. There was also a band revolv- ing around the base of the ob- ject which had many straight lines !<forming some kind of a lighted .design. The witness said her first thought was that \"this was some kind of govern- ment project advertizing some- thing, but I couldn't under- stand what the design moving around the disk was .saying, if anything.\" The bottom center around which the design was re- volving protruded out, and the bottom of the protrusion was flat. Part of the design was blocked out of view because of this protrusion.• The witness said she was \"really amazed arid curious\" as she viewed \"this big strange object,\" but \"then I began to get scared, as I had never seen anything like this before.\" . . The object was in a slanted position, and the entire object spinned clockwise and gave off a high pitched humming sound. There was no wind .created by the object. It was very close to the light poles, electric poles and building, hovering over them and appearing as if it wanted to land there. • Everyone watches While the witness had been watching the object, the traf- fic light turned green, but she did not move and neither did anybody else stopped at the traffic light. It was about this time that she noticed the guy in the car to her right roll his window down, laugh; and say, \"Hey, that up there is a flying saucer!\" 'She also noticed the driver of a car behind and to her right get out of the car, lean on his car and stare at the ob- ject. At some point during all this she also rolled her window down and looked at the object. She did not keep count on how many times the traffic light changed and no one at the intersection moved, but it was several times. She stayed there, for approximately 5 minutes. The witness does not remember j whether there were any parked '_ cars on the lot; if there were \\\\ any, it was not many. Her son started to get scared and she was afraid that the ob- ject might get tangled up with the electric lines or hit one of the light poles, -so she de- cided to leave. She turned left at the intersection and drove two blocks on Chapel Street. When she drove on, the other cars followed.

At this point, .she turned into the Newark Shopping Center and got out of the car. She approached a lady walking out of the Acme Supermarket and told her, \"Look, look up in the sky,\" and as they both looked, the object was disappearing very quickly straight up in the ,,\" sky above them. As the object ascended, no exhaust was visi- . ble. There was ho visible emi- - sion coming out of the bottom of the object. • The witness . . - It is my impression that the main witness is a trustworthy, reliable person and that she saw what she, described. She did not read UFO literature be- fore, the sighting and paid.only minor attention to articles in newspapers. She does . not want her name used in any way what- soever with this matter. I did not interview the boy ^because of his age, but he did mention that he saw a.big object with lights, and he got scared be- cause it was going to fall on them. 'Additional witness check The sighting area was checked for additional witnesses by a door-to-door canvass, but none was found. Nearly all of the potential witnesses were very helpful, easygoing and talked to me carefree. The occupant of the house next to the used car sales lot was the only one that gave me the impression that he was hiding something. When I asked him about the sighting he. quickly answered, \"We saw no- thing, goodnight.\" His son (around 11 years old) started saying something about an ob- ject and • lights going off and on but his father just looked at him and 'repeated that they had seen nothing. I explained to him what MUFON is and that \"anything he said would be treated confidentially. He re- peated again, \"We saw nothing.\" Natural phenomena check' Due to the nature of the ob- ject described, , all'natural phenomena.' were discounted .as a possible cause for the sight- ing. ..\"'.''< Man-made object check The only obj ect which could remotely be the cause of this sighting would be a balloon or a blimp. The balloon can be disregarded due to the quick ascension and disappearance of the UFO. The wind speed for that night was 10 m.p.h. Al- though the direction coincides with that of the UFO, the speed of the wind can't account,for the fast disappearance of the object. The blimp,can be eliminated rfhen one asks such .questions, as: -what would a blimp be doing so close to the ground, on top of a busy intersection almost colliding . with a building, street -lights and power lines?' Why wouldn't the witness have been able to identify the ob- ject as a blimp? Any-conven- tional object, that- size, so close to the ground would crer- ate a lot of wind commotion and noise. The object in question made only a high-pitched hum and created - no wind distur- bance . : • .' Other possibilities The hallucination possibil- ity can be discounted. The witness and her .son saw it and, according to them, other people also saw it and.,^acknowledge their seeing it by their ac- tions and remarks. A hoax-does not seem possible because of the number of people that would have had to have been fooled under the circumstances ...-.The object was just .too huge and the area just too .busy. No psychic phenomena to my know- ledge could have caused this sighting. - . Man claims UFO controlled auto By Richard Hall MUFON International Coordinator Some UFO witnesses have reported that they have lost control of their cars, seemingly overpowered by a superior force, while being paced or approached by a UFO. The following report, excerpted from the transcript of a tape-recorded inter- view by the Tasmanian U.F.O. Investiga- tion Centre, describes a similar occur- rance near Bridgewater, north of Hobart, in July, 1974. The witness, whose name is on record, prefers to remain anonymous. Q. Could you tell us now what it-looked like? A. Well, there was no actual definite shape; it seemed to be oval, definitely didn't appear to have wings, it had a front top light—a red one, and this larger bottom light...We went along the highway and turned off. It hovered as we turned and seemed to keep pace with us. . Q. There was no noise? A. There seemed to be no noise, no. It was so queer it was perfectly silent. (Des- cribes the UFO speeding up when they, speeded up and slowing when they - slowed. As they passed onto the main road near Campania, where there were a few houses, the UFO remained higher and at a greater dis- tance, and when they left \"civ- ilization\" again it once again descended below hilltop height and resumed pacing the car). After it came down again I felt as if I was in its power, as if it was definitely going to take over the controls of the car; it was hard to steer/ We did wander right over to the right side of the road where .the ob- ject was; to pull -it back onto the right side of the road was quite an effort. I can remember that after it disappeared that my arms ached around the shoul- ders, so I was making quite ah effort to keep the car where it should be.... . Q. Did the car slow at all? A. No, seemed as if the. car wasn't in my power.

These amateur astron- omers , a -maj ority of whom are qualified observers with preci- sion instruments, typically Page 12 make no money from their con- tributions, but engage in as- tronomical study for sheer love of the work. This is not to take anything away from professional astron- omers. ' But there -is no great difference' between the QUALITY of -work put out by a paid pro- fessional-astronomer- and a good amateur. Most'professional as- tronomers are only too glad.to admit to this : fact. .••-.•• - So to our \"amateur\" ufolo- gists.\" The very word \"ufolo- gist\" brings up .'another seman- tical snag. What is a ufolo- gist?' • It is one who studies ufology--the classification of UFOs. One \"could say that the first ufologists HAD to.be ama- teurs. Since ufology has been in existence Mess than twenty- five years,•it has not yet be- come a science. Too little is known about. UFOs to even prop- erly classify them and class- ification is the heart of any science. ' . • ; Likewise;• almost nothing is known of the facts behind their existence--what they are, their purpose and motives, how they are propelled. A prolonged- study into the literature leaves any researcher, scien- tist and non-scientist alike, agape with their seemingly in- finite complexity; It must be admitted by ANYONE' who studies • UFOs that ufology is not -yet a\" science, and therefore'a ufologist is not a scientist; per se. The only answer to 'this problem lies iii determining who is'competent to study UFOs. At present this research requires two things: 1. detailed doc- umentation, without.prejudice, of ; whatever facts are available from 1 individual sightings, and 2. generous individual • dona- tion of timei energy and re-_ sources without hope of compen- sation. -'Let us hope that this second requirement will change before very longi -But until'money , grants become 'available to fund research projects, a ufologist must willingly pay his own way. Referring back to the two requirements for a ufologist, 1. an ability\" to perform com- petent research and 2. a will- ingness to give of his/her own resources---where does anyone get the idea that only scien- tists can fill these demands? Are only scientist per se CA- PABLE of being ufolgoists? Why are non-scientists referred to as \"amateurs\"? \" When I was taking- graduate training in the field' of social casework/ an established and respected profession, one ' of the first things taught us was the definition of 'a \"profes- sion.\" A profession possesses two elements: 1. it provides a- needful 1 and trained service to society arid 2. the members should give that service with financial reward being second- ary in their minds. - ; -~ ' ; ' '.'-,- If you review the require- ments for a \"profession\" and for a \"ufologist,\" you -will note that they are almost iden-j tical. Therefore, a competent ufologist scientist and non- scientist alike—is' to -all in- tents and purposes a profes- sional. • It all comes down to whether each individual researcher is competent to study UFOs.

And vice versa. Let's face it. In ufology there are no real \"profession- als\" because of the tenuous nature of the subject. There are no \"amateurs\" either, be- cause .\"amateur\" is in semanti- cal, opposition to \"profession- al.\" There are only those per- sons who can competently give, of themselves..

When the time comes, that sufficient knowledge is availa- ble as to the. nature .of UFOs, and they can be properly class- ified and studied, only then will ufology be. a science. The distinction of \"amateur\" as op- posed to \"scientist\" as used at present simply does not apply. In Southern. California, the mainstream of UFO research since 1955 has been handled by a comparatively small group of dedicated persons. The nucleus group composed.the Los Angeles NICAP Subcommittee from 1959 through 1971. It included a bio-physicist, three engineers, a public relations person, a bookkeeper, a social worker and a secretary. . We worked together fruitfully and in harmony for twelve years. . Since 1972, when it transferred k its resources to MUFON, - the group has . grown man/fold, pulling -in scientists in varied- disciplines and other researchers of widely disparate skills.

Perhaps I am, but while others line up to sing the praises of various \"authorities\" in. the UFO field, I am finding, more to complain about. . No better example of my dissatisfaction could be found .than the recent book by J. Al- len Hynek and Jacques Vallee, THE EDGE OF REALITY. I respect the credentials of .the authors ,and I find • their DATA of con- 'siderable interest, but their theories and conclusions (such as they are) are a different matter. . Both Vallee and - Hynek feel that the extraterrestrial hy- pothesis is inadequate to ex- plain UFO activity. Vallee summarizes his view by saying: \"We know that there is an un- known phenomenon being mani- fested. It appears to center on a technological device, a machine that is capable of transporting occupants. The behavior is not consistent either with what you would ex- pect from space -visitors, or with what we know about phy- sics.\" •'• To my way of thinking, Vallee is ACTUALLY saying, in effect, \"They don't play by our rules, -therefore they can't be space visitors.\" Vallee also finds no purpose, in the celestial peregrinations of the UFOs. I would suggest that if one finds no logic or purpose in the ac- tivities' of the UFOs, the fault might well lie within the ob- server, rather than that which is being observed. To presume that we know' what extraterres- trials SHOULD do and how they SHOULD act is nothing more than a combination of profound ego- tism and naivete. I do not suggest that all (continued on page 16) By Richard H. Hall International Coordinator Despite its unusual format-- fragmentary transcripts of taped discussions--this is an absorbing and highly readable book. It is at once loosely organized, yet coherent; casual and informal, yet. penetrating. Although it is a potporri of personal anecdotes and experi- ences, illustrative UFO sight- ings, analytical discussion, and free-wheeling brainstorm- ing, its focus is clear: by all familiar measures UFOs are \"real,\" but that reality seems to skirt the edges of accepted science and to 'Suggest the need for revision of scientific con- cepts. Reasonable men may disagree on exactly what reforms are needed, but the notion serves as a springboard for interest- ing speculation and the exer- cise is mind-expanding. The book probes the question of where we now stand: what is the evidence and what will it take to explain it? No doubt there is a good consensus on the first part of the question; however, the second part is likely to be more controversial and it is clear that there is no simple answer. The answer, if there is one, is involved with complex interactions of science, politics, sociology, psychology, and possible para- psychology. My gripes with the book are minor factual ones only. It is a good and thought-provoking survey well worth the attention of all serious students of UFOs for its discussions of the cen- tral questions. An incidental benefit is the insight gained into the atti- tudes and thought patterns .of the authors, who have played important roles in the effort to have UFOs studied scientifi- cally.  •\"'••. (end of review) By Dwight Connelly Editor-Publisher THE EDGE OF REALITY is a book which is honest, if egotisti- cal. It is a valuable book in the sense'that it enables both fans and- detractors of Dr. Hynek and Dr. Vallee to know where these gentlemen stand— and where they fall. It is an interesting book for the same reason. It is a re- freshing book because of its off-the-cuff format. It is a disturbing book because it shows the rather primitive state of UFO research. The total impression one is left with after reading the conversations between Hynek and Vallee, which make up the bulk of this book, is that the two \"experts\" do not seem to know as much as they should. In other words, their conversa- tions are no more brilliant and their \"facts\" are no more ac- curate than other novices who have studied UFO literature and guessed at its meaning. Perhaps ,., it is difficult to live up to reputations in a field where there are really no experts--where amateurs know as much as scientists with Ph.D.'s. At any rate, the two authors certainly come off as being quite human in their ex- pertise, though one_gets the impression from reading the book that they see themselves as more God-like. One problem the two authors face is that they bill, .them- selves as .scientists, yet do not possess UFO credentials which are any more scientific than those of anyone else. Moreover; the very topic of converea'tion—the edge of real- ity—tends .to pull them from known science into unknown areas. They are challenged more than enough in the former; they are on treacherously thin ice in the latter. Still, if one does not at- (continued on page 16) Page 15"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"EDGE OF REALITY review by Parish (continued from page, 15) UFOs are spaceships; if, I kfiew what UFOs are, •!• would not be writing these\"words. But, I do think it is a grave error to reject a POSSIBILITY merely be- cause elements of that possi- bility .do not fit one's pre- conceived notions. Much more could be said about, the errors and numerous.: examples.of fuzzy thinking to' be found in THE EDGE-'OF. REALITY, but space does not permit a full accounting. Suffice it to say, the UFO or- ganizations come in for-.their lumps, while the Center for UFO Studies is touted as a \"scien- tific\" body which, is willing to .\"cooperate\" with all groups and publications. We., have already seen? the.extent, of .the Center's \"cooperation\", and it leaves a great deal.to be desired. \". Overall, Vallee comes off much' better than' Hyriek in this series of transcribed conver-. ; sations with Dr. Arthur C. Has- tings. Vallee seems to recog- .hize the danger of \"scientific Recognition\" for the UFO sub- ject and he also points up the inadequacies of computer tech- niques. When Hynek comments on Charles Fort's writings, for instance, it is obvious that he does not have' the faintest clue as to what Fort was \"all a- bout.\" ' . . Both^men.. seem , to favor a _\"paralle,L world\" concept to ex- plain UFOs. While this certain- ly cannot.be ruled .put, they would do well to 'remember a quotation from ,another recent book on the ,subject: \"...if one wishes to .postulate worlds other than physical (astral or etheric), one can,easily satis- fy and explain virtually all the reported antics of the UFO. But how do you establish that the .hypothesis is true? Unless you ; have ••an operational method of: .doing so, \"it is not SCI- ENCE.\" That, quote?

For example, .the following ex- change . (p. 258-59), which is moderated, by Arthur C. Hastr ings, a researcher in parapsy- chology: . . Psychic Projection . . Hynek: Now, as part of our hypotheses when we're examining the panoply of hypotheses, .\"we should take into account : the paranormal phenomena that are being written about and appar- ently being experienced. Should those psychic claims be true, it opens up another can of worms. Then the problem essen- tially is solved; that explains why UFOs can make right angle turns, that explains why they can be dematerialized,., .why sometimes they are .not .detected by our infrared equipment. ,A11 that. But that's dangerous ter- ritory to tread. . - Vallee: Why does it explain all that?. . ..-.:. .Hynek: Well, because psychic projections aren't picked up on radarsi that I know of. . Vallee: . That's right, as far as-we know they aren't, but UFOs are. Hynek: Some are, some not— there are many times when UFOs aren't picked up. Vallee: .There are ways of making an airplane invisible to radar.   • Hynek: Yes, well, I'm not sure that there are, that's one of the things that they're -cer- tainly trying very hard to do. But if they, had that, then all planes, or. all military planes, would be fixed up so they, couldn't be picked up on 1 radar. .Hastings: Invisibility is one of the occult, abilities. Vallee: I understand what you're saying, Allen, but it's not clear to- me that it ex- plains it. I mean when you say it explains everything, I don't agree with it. . . Hynek: It certainly would .explain the apparent violation of the laws of physics, because psychic projection doesn't have to obey Newton's law of gravi- tation, it doesh''t have to obey F=ma. To that extent it would get around it. Vallee: ' It has to obey F-ma if it has mass. ' : Hynek: Psychic projection probably doesn't have mass. Vallee: Then it doesn't ex- plain the 800 cases of traces left on the ground by UFOs that Ted Phillips has collected. You said in the beginning that those are the things that any theory must explain, right? If it doesn't explain it, why would it be a good theory? Hynek: All right/ why do poltergeists move something and yet don't appear on radar? Do they, the poltergeists, have that physical reality? And yet they have physical effects! In other words,, we have a phenome- non here that undoubtedly has physical effects but also has the attributes of the psychic world. In addition to such \"brain- storming\" sessions, the book also features a few actual cases. One of the more inter- esting is entitled, \"The Night an Occupant Was Shot.\" This particular case apparently took place in North Dakota (the book says only \"in the northern plains\") a number of years ago. This case is, by the way, still .very much \"open\" and an addi- tional attempt has been made within the past year to.obtain more details (this is not men- tioned in the book). The other cases are pretty well known, such as the sight- ing ; by the Rev. Gill in New Guinea in 1959. . One of the more controver- sial, ill-considered> and inac- curate sections of the book is made up of attacks on the \"pri- vate\" UFO groups, such as APRO, MUFON,. and NICAP (excluding, naturally, the Center for UFO Studies).

We know that the publicized 73-74 \"French wave\" was very probably not a wave at all, and only a result of such mass-media on French people during this period, when 39 broadcasts on UFOs were transmitted by the French ra- dio. Therefore, the UFO wave of 73-74 in France and Europe (Germany, Spain, Italy, Ruman- ia, England, etc) is not com- parable in quality and volume with the famous French wave of 1954: low-level events are num- erous, but humanoid cases are very rare. I have seriously studied this period of four months (from December, 1973, to March, 1974) and found a total of 183 UFOs events in France only. This work is the -result of an in- depth study,\" hour by hour, day after day, and month after month of the French cases, and I can say that very strange things have hovered at low al- titude in the French skies, be- ing seen by several witnesses in numerous events, and defin- itively cannot be identified by 'Mr. Menzel or the late Dr. Con- don. I have in fact identified a great number of \"UFOs\" (mainly misinterpretations of the moon crescent, the planet Venus, and sounding balloons), but these 183 cases are remaining after all these studies...

The real numbers of UFOs seen dur- ing these periods of darkness are exceeding the theoretical numbers expected for these same periods. The hypothesis of equivalence of all the hours of day ,or night for a UFO to be seen cannot be the right one Page 17"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"(the hypothesis of \"equiproba- bility\" is often applied in statistics).

The conclusion is very sim- ple: during periods of lower luminosities—such as night.and night without moon--the number of UFOs observed is greater than the number of UFOs that can .be expected from . a., theor- etical point of view, the lower the luminosity, the higher the number of UFOs seen. Because the UFOs are not shy—I presume --we.must, admit the following hypothesis: 1) the UFOs are often very luminous by themselves 2) the UFOs are of a physi- 62 cal nature , These two simple logical ex- planations are of unusual im- portance, as anybody will ack- nowledge...! hope such little remarks will perhaps help us to go out of the, \"parapsychology wave,\" which is nowadays a dead end of Ufology. Thanks to such men as the late Dr. McDonald. and Mr. McCampbell, we can hope that the physical hypothesis of UFOs will be the hypothesis of the XXI century, if not of the end of our own XX century. Ph.D. dissertation studies McDonald Paul McCarthy has written a Ph.D. dissertation which takes a detailed look at James E. Mc- Donald's 1966 UFO activities, making the case that the scien- tific .process is a political process. Chapters of the thesis in- clude one on the University of Colorado Project; one on the 1968 Congressional Symposium, essentially arguing that McDon- ald masterminded it; one on the office of Naval .Research ''Con- troversy in which Phil Klass attempted to discredit McDonald and claim that he misspent Navy Page 18 funds; and one on the AAAS Sym- posium in Boston showing how Sagan § Page, for their own; questionable motives, pushed through a panel discussion over the objections and severe op- position of Menzel and Condon. The-study portrays McDonald as a \"revolutionary\" scientist forced to adopt \"extreme\" tac- tics (in opposition to the other-extreme tactics of UFO debunkers) in order -to pursue the UFO problem. The study so far has only been circulated privately—Richard Hall. EDGE OF REALITY review By Connelly (continued from page 16) to attack the groups he claims to want to work with is, to coin a phrase, beyond reality. It is especially surprising that he should falsely accuse these .groups of the very things which CUFOS is undeniably guil- ty of: such as failing to pro- duce \"scientific\" papers. Vallee, for his part,- shows inexcusable ignorance concern- ing the \"bulletins\", of. these. UFO groups, charging that \"if you buy the typical bulletin of one of these groups, you will have a two-page . editorial that says Mr. Such-and-Such has re- signed; Mrs. So-and-So's knees aren't getting any better (club news); So-and-So gave a lecture and it was enthusiastically re- ported in the MORNING STAR REG- ISTER: and, we're making great progress. That's about it.\" Here at Skylook we receive all the major \"bulletins\" and most of the minor ones—foreign and domestic—and, whatever their demerits, none fits Val- lee 's strange perceptions. Even this aspect of the book .is interesting,, however, since it too indicates where these two \"names\" are—in terms of their perceptions of other UFO researchers and groups. In general, the Hynek-Vallee Rule applies: the farther the re- searcher, group, or publication is from the U.S., the more ac- ceptable the researcher, group, or publication becomes—with the exception of CUFOS, of course. Although the book is a so- bering letdown, even a sobering letdown can be worthwhile and interesting. I highly recom- mend the book.

The San Antonio, Texas, oc- cupant case (5/3/75) bears such a striking resemblance to the Ririe, Idaho, (11/2/67) occu- pant encounter in so many features of appearance that it invites detailed comparison. In both cases disc-like UFOs with transparent \"bubble\" domes approched vehicles, stopped and hovered above them. Each had two occupants with large ears and hairless heads (eyes and other features differ), one of whom looked directly at the witness while the other looked away. ' Both UFOs seemed to have \"control panels.\" The Idaho case is reported, with detailed sketch, in UFOs: A NEW LOOK CNICAP, 1969) along with two other cases • in which two occupants were seen inside a clear dome. The four cases contain many features in com- mon, including brilliant lights (green, red, and orange) either around the rim or like a. beam from the underside, 'and Vehi- cle-like UFOs that hovered at low altitude, turned and til- ted. In the recent Texas case a strong odor like burning wires or metal was noted; in Blenheim, N. Z. (7/13/59) an odor like pepper filled the air. The summary of separate in- vestigations of the Travis Wal- ton abduction story is useful and informative. Some points worth consideration have been made by GSW, NICAP, and APRO, but can we say that all the facts are in and , investigation is complete? It seems to me that some people are committing the same sin often attributed to scien- tists—leaping to conclusions and failing to resolve discrep- ancies or gather all the infor- mation before passing judgment. There is no excuse for us not to suspend judgment (whether or not scientists practice what Page 20 By Richard Hall S*n 5/3/75- they preach) in complex cases of this kind. Some clarification is needed of the Waltons 1 pre-existing attitudes toward the knowledge of UFOs and of the NICAP claim that Travis tried to force him- self on a talk show host. On the other hand,. APRO's psycho- logical testing yielded strong positive results, and several witnesses attest to the basic circumstances of the encounter. I agree that skepticism toward spectacular UFO cases is far healthier than gullibility, but a negative form of skepticism that prejudges a report may be just as selfdeluding as gulli- ble belief. We should be far more willing to keep a case open indefinite- ly, arid feel less compulsion to come up with a final \"yes\" or \"no\" answer simply for or- ganizational image reasons. The best image is cautious, careful open-mindedness and painstaking investigation. Schuessler's resignation Deputy Director John Schuesr- sler's candid resignation statement touches on many cri- tical points as well as frus- trations of UFO investigation. It needs to be said openly that serious friction .exists between a number of important MUFON personnel and Dr. Hynek's Cen- ter for UFO Studies (CUFOS). I, too, have some reservations about CUFOS -but I continue to approve of MUFON's policy of full cooperation. Whatever we may think of Hynek or CUFOS, the Center is a rallying point for scientists who treat UFOs seriously. We badly need the resources of science to properly study UFOs. Politics makes -strange bedfel- lows ; we need them and they need us. Mare tact and diplom- acy on both sides would help, for the sake of our common goals. stronomy Notes By Mark R.
