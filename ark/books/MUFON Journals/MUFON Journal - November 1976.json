FROM THE EDITOR The International UFOlogy Conference, described on page 12 of this issue, may be one of the most important UFO meet- ings ever. Judging from, the speaker's lineup, nearly all the major research- ers in the field will be in attend- ance, not to ment- ion scores of pro- fessional ufolog- ists in the audi- ence. But even more important will be the many behind-the- scenes meetings of foreign ufologists and government lead- ers. Hopefully real progress can be made in the areas of in- formation exchange and a new, world- wide effort to solve the UFO problem. The Mexican gov- ernment's interest in the UFO phenom- enon has reached a peak with the inaug- uration of President Portillo. Many of the government's off- icial agencies are helping to insure the success of the Con^- ference. All this leads me to hope that Mexico, which is a member of the UN Out- er Space Committee, will take the lead in bringing the UFO pro- blem to the floor of the United Nations.

It is ex- tremely rare to have the op- portunity to evaluate photographic data on purported occupants. During the Flap of 1973 there were dozens of reports of \"creatures\" connected directly to the observation of the UFO phenomenon. One such picture from the 1973 sightings was forwarded to GSW for analysis, by Walt Andrus - Director of MUFON. Com- puterized evaluation techniques have been utilized by our organization on 600 + UFO photographs. If an \"object\" can be analyzed, then obviously, an image of a human-like creature can be tested for its authenticity. The Falkville, Alabama oc- cupant photographs were subr jected to .the following computer- aid . evaluations: edge enhan- cement, color cbntouring, pixel distortion analysis, and digitizing. Edge Enhancement - The total series of pictures, were subjected to edge enhancement to gain details.of the \"creature 's\" edges ; and surface condition. By enhan- ceihg or detailing the edges it helped to alleviate some of the reflections of light that was boun- cing wildly off the aluminum colored suit arid ; obscuring the details. \";•>/• ;/•.: ; : The edging also detailed the surface of the suit (skin) by can- celing the reflections and facets of light. This enabled the technicians Police Chief G r e. e n h a uj y s h o a s his,posit ion rel- ative to that o'f'' . t h e ' c rve a t u r e (X). to observe surface details and identify random pieces of aluminum foil or wrap ; laced on the suit. Reference should be made to the Analysis Explanation Sheet which 'details all the ^various modes of; evaluation/testing utilized on these photographs. , Color Contouring - All the pic- tures were submitted to the coloring technique to test the . irnagef or its true grey v alue (den- sity),; which blends contdnously both in intensity (level) and; spatiality (area). This technique gives the photographic analyzer hard data on the light source and its direction to the ^subject being photographed and the actual den- sity of the image, this method of testing is also utilized to evaluate background data by revealing anamalous densities, barely visible to the human eye. The entire set of photographs were scanned utilizing the digital densitometer and the areas of in- terest were recorded for com- parison between pictures. Pixel Distortion Analysis - Pixel (picture cell) analysis was per- formed to evaluate , the ap- . proximate distance of the image from, the camera/witness. The edges of the image are outlined with a special computer program, then these same edges (areas) are magnified and the individual \\squares of pixels are measured for their relative straightness or lack of the same. Reference should be made to Figure 4 depic- ting pixel distance information. The general rule for distance, measured from the pixels data is simple; :'if-.the' pixels are! straight the image is;close, conversely if the pixels are wavy this denotes a distance factor.

Various modes of digitizing add picture clarity and resolution to the original, therefore, lighten dark areas, highlight shadows and finite por- tions on the film, and increase the overall contrast of the film. Digitizing added details to each image to enable -accurate measurements of image size, height, width, position, etc. This was accomplished on a video micrometer that measures dimensions in .001\" units. Conclusions - It is the concensus of the photographic analyzers that the photographs in question should not be considered strong evidence of an extra-terrestrial entity. The following data is sup- plied to quantify the same: A) The outer garment of the alledged creature is a hot suit, manufactured from fire retardent materials, including asbestus and other non-combustible/non con- ducting fibres, then coated with an aluminum covering. B) A flash attachment Was utilized during the exposure, which highlighted upon the wrinkled surface and reflected brilliantly, thus masking some ob- vious details of manufacture. C) Digital densitometry revealed certain areas of lover reflectivity, not • attributed to shadows or reflection. Further analysis revealed that these in- consistancies are attributed to 'patches' of aluminum foil, spar- sely positioned on the overall suit. Possibly placed on the 'suit' to mask known manufacturing signs, ie, buttons, zippers, in- signias,etc. D) The anatomical features depicted within the pictures are considered normal (human-like) including; the length of the arms, the position of the features, and their relative sizes. The ballooning effect of the legs and feet is due to the manufacture of the suit and not that of the body in- side the garment. E) Picture factoring, calculated without the benefit of the known reference points, revealed that the entity was between 5 feet 6 in- ches and 6 feet tall 1 . F) Void of the actual camera data, the photograph was takne at a relatively close distance. Com- puted at less than twelve feet (camera to object distance) At best, these pictures represent a humorous attempt at hoaxing a space creature, which GSW believes was initiated by the tremendous media coverage in the southern states, during the Flap of 1973.

NEW AUSTRALIAN CASE UNDER INVESTIGATION By Richard Hall MUFON International Coordinator A strange case currently under investigation in New South Wales was reported to me by Bill Chalker in a letter dated June 1, 1976. On March 22, 1976, at 5:45 AM in Nemingha, N.S.W., a Murrundi couple and a utility truck driver were parked opposite the Nemingha Hotel' when they noticed a small white car with the headlights on approaching. A bright light \"from above\" descen- ded over the car; greenish-yellow light from the object covered the car. At this moment; the car became enveloped in a thick ball of white haze and the headlights went out. \"The car was now well on its wrong side of the road,\" Chalker said. \"After about 2 minutes the haze seemed to dissipate and finally a woman got out of the car and proceeded to wipe the win- dscreen with a yellow cloth. The windscreen seemed to be covered with a white substance.\" A few minutes later the woman was about to get back in the car when the lights came back on suddenly. \"She appeared to be somewhat surprised, and then threw away the cloth, which then 'burst into flames.' \" The witnesses saw the car proceed very slowly toward Nundle, totally covered by a thick white substance \"not unlike white paint,\" except for the cleared win- dscreen. \"This rather bizarre case has no obvious explanation at the moment,\" Chalker reported, \"and I intend to investigate it in detail. The time of the year (here) is late summer.\""},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"TheSkynetLog: Circling Ships By Ann Druffel and Morrey Allen On the evening of September 5, 1976 a puzzling incident involving four witnesses occurred in the Los Angeles Basin area. In Canoga Park and Reseda, two com- munities lying twenty and twenty-, four miles respectively northwest to the Civic Center, separate pairs of citizens excitedly reported two whirling discs in the sky. The ob- jects, seen in a stormy sky, were exchanging or \"interlocking\" rays of light as they rapidly cir- cled each other. . .. . On September 6th, Mary Ann Ryman called SKYNET #3 (Druf- fel); having been referred by the local police. She stated that she and her mother-in-law, Tess Ryman, had been watching TV at 6:50 p.m. the previous evening in their home in a residential area of Canoga Park. Seeing the first flashes of an approaching elec- trical storm, Tess Ryman stepped out onto the patio. The lightning was some miles away, in the nor- th. She then noticed two softly glowing balls of light above her and at first \"thought they were clouds\". She changed her opinion rapidly, however, as they moved silently in rapid circles over the ; backyard. Tess Ryman called her daughter-in-law and for twenty minutes the two startled women watched the lights repeatedly sweep in precise maneuvers above their heads. Both witnesses had the impression the lights were at very low altitude and were -amanating from solid objects. The lights were the color of GE light bulbs, with a touch of blue, and glowed softly \"like a moon behind clouds\". They were equal in size and were viewed against a heavy, gray layer of rain clouds. An on-the-spot investigation was conducted on behalf of MUFON and CUFOS (by Druffel) on September 7th. Both witnesses seemed stable and reliable and did not seem to tend toward em- bellishment. Some discrepancies in the two accounts were easily accounted for if one considers that Tess Ryman's eyesight is not as sharp as her daughter-in-law's. But the general appearance of the lights, their maneuvers, and the duration of sighting coincided in both accounts. Mary Ann Ryman stated that clearly defined rays, of unequal length, shot out from the perimeter of each object. Ap- parent size of the objects plus rays was about one and one-half inches at arm's length. These rays extended, on the average, about one and one-half times the diameter of the objects. They reminded her somewhat of \"rays of the sun\", though much less in- tense. Tess Ryman did not see the rays, but viewed the edges of the objects as indefinite, \"like the jaggedy edges of a cloud\". Tess Ryman was frightened by the persistent circling of the ob- •, jects, fearing that \"one of them might drop\". Mary Ann Ryman, who had read some literature on UFOs, theorized that the lights were \"UFOs\" or \"ships\" which were surveying the neighborhood. She was frankly fascinated by them. Mary Ann Ryman described three precise \"maneuvers\" per- formed by the objects. Maneuver A (See Sketch 1) was the tight cir- cles, exact and almost acrobatic, which the objects executed over and over in the same area of sky above their yard. Each circle was of nine to ten seconds duration. The center of the circle was measured at fifty-five degrees above the southern horizon. The diameter of the circles was about seventy degrees. During these cir- cular motions, the objects stayed an exact distance from each other, moving clockwise. The true diameter of their circles, as measured by Mary Ann Ryman, was about two-hundred and fifty feet, assuming that the witnesses' estimate of the objects' altitude was correct. They were fairly cer- tain that the objects were slightly above a telephone pole at one cor- ner of the yard (estimated height forty feet). The objects did not rotate on their own axes, though Mary Ann Ryman spoke of each \"ship\" having a front and a back. The witnesses stated that the objects would complete about eight perfect circles, then go into the second \"maneuver\". (See Sketch 2) During this, they made a crisscross motion into the circle, moving toward each other and passing less than a diameter's length away. While passing each other, the rays \"interlocked\" briefly. (See Sketch 4) Then the objects would exchange places with each other on the perimeter of the circle, continuing on for eight more circles before coming together again. Maneuver B took approximately five seconds. In Maneuver C, the objects left"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"SKETCH 1 MANEUVER \"A\" Round aspect, when overhead and in southern sky Oval, or \"banking\" effect, in : eastern and western positions.

(See Sketch 3) This maneuver took about thirty secon- ds and was performed only about one-fourth the number of times Maneuver B was performed. The interlocking of the rays seemed to impress Mary Ann Ryman deeply. She stated the rays definitely overlapped each time the objects passed closely. During these periods, the area between the objects brightened considerably. She suggested that during interlocking, the objects might have been communicating in an \"exchange\" or \"talking time\". After watching the objects per- form for a full twenty minutes, the special interest in \"double UFOs\", which are generally described as two spherical objects joined by a link or bar. But it was puzzling why no one else in the neighborhood had reported the ob- jects. Mary Ann Ryman inquired of her neighbors, but none of them had been outside at the beginning of the lightning storm. The storm was a most violent one, resulting from freak meteorological conditions. In in- tensity, it rivaled none in this area during the past thirty years. On the same evening, Sep- tember 5th, at about 6:45 p.m., a young, frightened man, Mr. R.J., had called SKYNET #3 (Druffel) to report that two glowing balls were over his Reseda residence, whirling around each other and \"exchanging flashes between them\". Since the sighting was still in progress at the time of the overhead\". The investigator had been outside watching the ap- proaching storm and had noted two searchlights in the area from which R.J. was calling. Everything about the lights R.J. was reporting compared favorably to searchlights, except that occasionally the beams of the searchlights were visible to the in- vestigator but were evidently not visible to R.J. When the rain came a few minutes later, the lights disap- peared, both by R.J.'s ob- servation and the investigator's as well. When the rain passed some time later, a number of lights reappeared, again noted by R.J. and again plainly identifiable from the investigator's position. Exchanging notes on the two cases, the writers came to the conclusion that Tess and Mary Ann Ryman must have been Sketch of the. glowing, objects women saw bolts of lightning flashing near their home. At this, the two objects \"sped off together toward the south\". A few seconds later, rain started to fall. It seemed as though the objects \"were keeping ahead of the storm\". This seemed to be a sighting of unusual interest, especially since the investigator (Druffel) has a 8 police-referred call, R.J. was referred immediately to SKYNET #68 (Allen) whose home lay three miles east from where R.J. was calling. R.J's grandmother was also witnessing the objects. Allen, also a MUFON in- vestigator, talked to R.J. by phone, and gained a detailed description of the \"two white discs of light maneuvering seeing the same searchlights which had frightened R.J. When this was discussed with Mary Ann Ryman, however, she firmly stated they could not have been searchlights on clouds. She reiterated the facts of the clearcut rays, the precise and long-lasting maneuvers, and the unwavering appearance of the lights which seemed to be emanating from"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"solid objects. Unusual meteorological con- ditions continued in the Los Angeles area for several more days. Three more reports of \"UFOs\", attributable to sear- chlights on clouds were received by SKYNET. During this period Mary Ann Ryman called Allen. She was watching searchlights playing on the underside of clouds, with the beams not visible. She had never noticed this before and could now understand why MUFON had labeled her first report as searchlights, because the effect was very similar. \"But,\" she continued, this is not what I saw on September 5th.\" During subsequent interviews, the witness stuck to her original statements. She pointed out that the most notable difference bet- ween her September 5th sighting and the searchlights viewed a few days later was that the sear- chlights flitted about in erratic manner on the uneven bottom sur- face of the cloud layer, whereas the September 5th objects maneuvered smoothly. Also there was the matter of the visual ap- pearance of the objects. At his home, with sketches and word-pictures at hand, in- vestigator Allen made up a color drawing. When it was shown to Mary Ann Ryman she exclaimed, \"That's it! That's what I saw!\" (See Allen's drawing, ac- companying this report) At this interview, the elder Mrs. Ryman was not available, haying suf- fered a painful injury, so we do not have her confirmation. The drawing shows the object as a disc, and in a second aspect as an ellipse in its \"banking\" position. Mary Ann Ryman had also noted that the elliptical form was adopted as the two objects sped off to the south just before the rains came. The most striking part of the drawing are the numerous, definite flowing rays which streak out against a dull gray sky. So we are left with a puzzle, two cases, with a confirmed ex- planation which fits most of the facts. But not all of them. What were the interlocking \"rays\" seen by Mary Ann Ryman? What were the \"ex- change of flashes\" reported by R.J? Sven assuming that the heavy, low cloud layer was unusually homogeneous in makeup, could searchlights give the appearance of precisely- moving solid objects which never strayed from definite paths? Would two searchlight operators \"play\" at meaneuvers with their searchlight beams over a small area of sky for twenty full minutes? It was not feasible to try to track down the searchlight ud- vertising companies involved, due to the fact that a number of sear- chlights were in operation over the area that night. Can these cases be explained simply as misidentifications? We know that the human eye has a tendency to add detail to unknown objects, especially if the observer is experiencing strong emotion. Thus R.J.'s frightened eyes could .have seen \"flashes\" when the two searchlight's edges came together. Mary Ann Ryman, in her elation, might likewise have added detail. Why she saw definite rays which \"interlocked\" remains the question here. This case probably reinforces our knowledge that witnesses, even those which seem most stable and reliable, cannot always be relied upon. We present this, not as a documented UFO report, but as an exple of how cases can seem to be what they are not, and of the vulnerability of human nature.

Ireland) This sighting, widely report- ed in the press, required much detailed investigation. The phe- nomena appeared on Highway C.D. 44, between Andelot and Blancheville, the chief witnesses of which were Andre and Dominique Sarnie and Patrick Pingwak. The event happened at about 12:15 a.m. on Saturday, August 16, 1975. - The following is the testi- mony of witness Andre Sarnie: My son Dominique, at this time doing military service in Toiil, was on leave. During the night, he awoke me, telling me to get up and go with him to witness something apparently unbe- ievable. He explained to me that when he was driving be- tween Andelot and Blanche- ville, accompanied by a friend , who also lived in Andelot, they were \"buzzed\" by a UFO which approached their car twice. He described the object as being roundish in shape, having a diameter of about 30 meters with a hemispheric section un- derneath. The object was bright and red/orange in color. Domi- nique's friend, Patrick Ping- wak, had a camera and he took a snapshot using flash. The object then immediately ap- proached the car very quickly. Panicking, my son made a rapid reverse turn back for about 500 meters to be nearer Andelot. My son's friend got 10 out of the car and took a second photograph. The object again approached the car at a terri- fying speed. Dominique made for Andelot fast!! Then he decided to find another witness to this phenomena. That is why he came for me. At first I was incredulous and not very con- vinced,, but, faced ..with the alarm of my son, I finally decided to go to the spot, by way of route R.N. 65. It was then that something happened at the crossroads at Cirey-Les- Morielles: I saw in front of me a hemispherical object, close to the ground and glowing red/ orange. It was over a small wood and was oscillating slight- ly. I drove onto route C.D. 137 to stop about 400 meters from route R.N. 65, so that I might observe the phenomena without leaving the car; engine kicking over and headlights out. At this time, two cars passed along the road in which the drivers must also have seen the phenomena but did not slow down. Some time later a second object appeared, identical to the for- mer. It came towards us from behind the car. However, I can state that at that moment we were no longer looking behind us —• all our attention was directed tow'ards the object which had come upon us. It is possible that this was the same object which we had seen over the small wood and that it had moved at a fantastic speed. Indeed, when on route C.D. 137 * I was facing north, whereas at \\ the first sighting on route R.N. .j 65 I was facing west in the direction of Chaumont. I also became afraid, realizing that I was witnessing an extraordi- nary event. I wheeled the car on the road and raced towards Chantereines. On arriving here, I stopped, in the street. The object had stopped at the end of the road but at any moment it might come into the vilalge. Feeling my blood freeze and fearing for my safety, I decided to make for Andelot by route C.D. 44. It must have been between 1 o'clock and 1:30 a.m. The object remained at the altitude of approximate-./ 30 meters, barely visible ir .he darkness. Convinced: that it would no longer follow 1 cross- ed the village away trom the object. After about 2 kilo- 1 meters, between Chantereines ; and Blancheville, the object jr appeared again in the middle of the road behind my car. At Blancheville, the object resum- ed the same position as at Chantereines, remaining at the entrance to the village., After a moment it disappeared.\" Testimony of Dominique Sarnie: \"It was around 11:30 p.m. as I was near the village of An- delot, going towards Boulogne in my father's car and ac-"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"companied by my friend, Pat- rick Pingwak. At about 100 meters from Andelot, on the left hand side of the road, I noticed a dim white light which grew rapidly in intensity. For several moments this light fol- lowed us for about 50 meters. I then stopped the car to get my camera. It is always in the car and always contains a roll of filni; The djbect was just above us and we could only make out the 'under-carriage'. It re- sembled an orange-colored semi-circle and emitted a very strong and vivid light which, however, 'did not light up the surrounding countryside. My friend wound down the window of the car and took the first photograph. In a flash, the ob- ject shot towards us at a fan- tastic speed. I threw the car into reverse and revved madly back from about 500 meters. The object followed us and we could make it out clearly. The top part emitted a dim white light. The lower part remained orange. I took the road to my right. Patrick again took a photograph of the object which was still above us. Again, in a flash, the object approached us. The 'under-carriage' was per- fectly clear but the rest of the object remained blurred.\" Lake Objects Reported In Scandinavia e y Richard Han MUFON 103,-OLDTOWNE Ro. • SEGUING TX 78155 Phone: 512-379-9216 (MUFON headquarters and Walt Andrus' home)... re. Professor Bertil Soderquist, MUFON Representative in Sweden, has reported several incidents of mysterious objects in lakes, but with no apparent UFO association. The most UFO-like occurred in March 1974 on Lake Jalka, northern Sweden (about 67.0 deg N; 19.9 deg E). Mr. R.R: was driving on the road between Gallivare and Porjus in the early morning. The weather was cloudy and chilly. As he approached the small lake (about 2.5 km by 300 m), he saw'a strange mist over the ice-free lake. On closer approach, he saw that the mist surrounded a mysterious object (see sketch) resting on the water. The object was about 15-20 m long, 5 m in height, and had a superstructure end- ing in a point. The contour was darkish. The witness hurried away, driven by a sudden fear. Oh August 10,1974, at 10:00 AM, Mr. & Mrs. K.C. were driving from their home in Holter; Norway (about 20 km north of Oslo) toward the town of Hamar. When they reached the southern end of Lake Mjosa, their attention was drawn to an object in the lake. What appeared to be a peri- scope was protruding about half a meter above the surface, about 50-70 meters from the shore. The \"periscope\" was apparently aimed toward the shore, where the road and a railroad pass very close to the lakeshore. Nine hours later, a local earthquake was registered in precisely this area. Lake Object In Lake Siljan, Dalarna Pro- vince (central Sweden), April 30, 1976, three witnesses saw a pointed object tearing a chan- nel through the ice between 5:15 and 5:30 pm. The object, estimated to be moving 90 km/hr, cut a channel 1 km long and 3-4 meters wide through the 20 cm thick ice. Ice-floes and water cascaded around it as it forced its way through the ice. The object was dark (2 witnesses) or gray (1 witness) and about 10 meters long."},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"International UFOIogy Conference To Be Held in Acapulco The fflailn A u di to rium , inhere the International UFOIogy Confer- ence u; x 11 be held in April.

Bar- row's article updating the film, \"UFO,\" is particularly interest- ing.    .-•.-. A couple of corrections: In the August column, I started that publisher Ray Palmer was combining his two magazines, SEARCH and FLYING SAU- CERS, into one bi-monthly publication, SEARCH. The name is correct, but the publi- cation schedule will be quarter- ly, rather than bi-monthly. The subscription rates are $5.00 per year. And, in the October column, I said a panel discus- sion on UFO's would be pub- lished in the December issue of PLAYBOY. Actually, this is now slated for the February issue, so perhaps this will reach you in time for you to obtain a copy, if you wish. If you have not yet obtained a copy of ASTRONOMY maga- zine's reprint, THE ZETA IN- CIDENT by Terence Dickin- son, here's a chance to do so at a savings. Stanton Friedman is selling copies at $2.50 each, postpaid. If your order is for five or more copies, they're only $2.00 each. Stan also offers additional discounts for pur- chases of more than 25 copies. This is an excellent publication and I regard it as \"must\" reading. Order from: UFORI — P.O. Box 502 — Union City, CA 94587. It may or may not do any good to write to your Congress- man about the UFO subject in general, but it will definitely benefit you if you'll write him and ask for copies of two Con- gressional Research Service booklets, EXTRATERRES- TRIAL INTELLIGENCE AND UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS: A SELECTED, ANNOTATED BIBLIOGRA- PHY (#76-35 SP - 45 pages) and THE UFO ENIGMA (#76-52 SP - 124 pages). Both publi- cations are well-written and certainly worth a 13c stamp and a few minutes of your time to acquest them. A reminder that James M. McCampbell V book, UFO- LOGY, is now available in a paperback edition, selling for $4.95.

Most of us know — roughly at least — what is alleged to have occurred in that Southwestern desert town on that particular day. Patrolman Lonnie Zamora said he saw a flame-spewing object which landed in a gulley, disgorged two humanoid occupants in white clothing, and then (with occupants again aboard) took off into the sky. It left behind burned brush, \"footprints\" (of both occupants and machine) and, Ray Stanford says, sam- ples of an exotic metal alloy which -presumably was not manufactured on this planet. As Stanford recounts the events following the incident, they un- fold like clues in a cosmic detective story. The metallic samples, allegedly confirmed as non-terrestrial by a NASA sci- entist, are lost or destroyed in testing. It all makes for fas- cinating reading and I found the book thoroughly intriguing, but other researchers whom Stanford names in the book are unhappy with his \"highly per- sonalized version of 'objective truth',\" to quote Richard Hall. This leaves Ye Olde Reviewer up the proverbial stump, won- dering just what the heck is the truth about the Socorro case?

The object, which appeared to be traveling on top of the water, suddenly ascend- ed. When the mate signaled it with the steamer's light, it appeared to respond with its own light. Then the object changed course, rose higher, and flew off on a course of 160 degrees. The surprised Third Mate sent for the Captain, who also sighted the object through binoculars. The Captain also sighted a second object, which approached the ship and flew away in the same fashion. They later sighted a third object in the distance. Some part of this third sighting was shared by three other members of the crew. The object was about 10 meters in diameter and about 2 meters thick, in the Captain's estimate. It had one blue light and three red lights on the underside and there were many port holes encircling the dome- shaped upper part. Inside the port holes there was a yel- lowish-white light, and the middle of the underside ap- peared whitish. Steersman Yoshio Kotani, 30 years old, a deckhand, and a salon boy were the other witnesses."},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"Pentagon Pantry: Is The Cupboard Bare ? By Richard Hall At the request of some friends, I have decided to prepare these comments about Ray Stanford's 1976 book on the 1964 Socorro, N.M. landing case. So far I have had mixed emotions about doing so, not wanting to dignify some of the allegations made by making a formal response, but not want- ing the lack of a response to suggest acceptance of Stan- ford's account. However, copies of the book were sent to many MUFON people and other active UFQ researchers, some of whom have insufficient back- ground to evaluate it. The Journal now seems to be an appropriate forum for plac- ing my objections on record. In a nutshell, I consider Stanford's account of NICAP's part in the Socorro investigation — and particularly his unfounded claims of a secret, positive analysis report on the alleged \"metal scrapings on the rock\" — to be both a highly distorted and a highly subjective version of what transpired. After reviewing the NICAP files and personal records, and checking with others present at NICAP in 1964, I wrote to Stanford July 21, 1976 chal- lenging him to produce (1) a copy of the tape, or even a transcript of it, which he claims to have made surreptitiously while riding in the car with Walt Webb and me to NASA Goddard Space Flight Center to have the same analyzed; (2) copies of the notes or phone memos made of the alleged phone conversations with the two NASA scientists, upon which he claims to have based his \"verbatim\" quotes. Having received no response, I sent him a reminder on December 13, 1976 of what had been re- quested. From Stanford's failure to produce these documents, I can only conclude either that he doesn't have them or that they would fail to support the most fundamentally important claims in his book. The surrep- titious taping of supposed col- leagues speaks for itself, and is indicative of the near paranoic suspicion upon which most of the argumentation in the book rests. Before going into more de- tail, these other points need to be made: • In a telephone conversation with Stanford July 12, 1975, I asked him whether he had tape-recorded his telephone conversations with the NASA scientists, which would end all controversy. He replied: \"No... If I had told them I was taping them they may not have talked so freely.\" If he, implicitly, so mistrusted Walt Webb and me that he saw overriding reasons to deceive us, why would he not tape the absolutely vital phone conversations that, he claims, prove a cover-up? Instead, he told me, his quotes of them were based on notes made immediately afterwards. • Why did Stanford wait 12 years (six years after I had left NICAP) to make a public issue of the Socorro case and my handling of it? If he believed then what he now professes to believe, why didn't he vigorous- ly protest at the time and force the issue with NICAP? And if he had evidence that he didn't trust NICAP to publish, why didn't he resign and publish it elsewhere? For all I knew until 1975, Stanford reluctantly ac- cepted the NASA analysis re- port despite his obvious desire at the time to believe that he had the conclusive physical proof of UFOs. • When Stanford first phoned me on June 20, 1975, he talked about a book he was writing on the Socorro case discussing the physical evidence. He did not say that the book would be highly critical of me and reach conclusions contradicting those of NICAP, nor did he offer me any opportunity to comment on the allegations that would be made. I volunteered that I had received a letter from Dr. James E. McDonald concerning a report of \"fused sand\" having been gathered at the landin.c site and analyzed by a chen^t. Stanford asked for a copy ot the letter, and I sent it on June 24th. In the book (p. 73) he refers to this letter as having 15"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"been obtained \"from the late Dr. James McDonald.\" Why he didn't credit me as the source — and owner — of the letter I don't know, but I suspect it was because to do so would show me as openly co- operating and concerned about the truth of the Socorrd case. This would tend to contradict his thesis that Richard Hall was more concerned with buttering up scientists than in seeking the truth. • Stanford apparently is off by a week in dating the trip to Goddard as July 31 (p. 120). Walter Webb wrote me July 12, 1976 that his diary shows for July 23, 1964: \"Met Ray Stan- ford at NICAP\"; and for July 24: \"To Goddard Space Flight Center...\" NASA ANALYSIS Stanford's claim that I was told the preliminary analysis pointed toward an .extrater- restrial source is the single most important — indeed, critical — claim bearing on my culpability (or stupidity). If I am called to testify before a Congressional committee investigating an al- leged cover-up of the Socorro case (Stanford's apparent goal), I will testify to what I am quite confident is the truth: Neither Dr. Frankel nor anyone else at NASA ever suggested to me that they were leaning toward an extraterrestrial interpreta- tion. In fact, when Dr. Frankel talked to me about tentative findings of a zinc-iron alloy, he said to me that the results suggested a zinc pail! No quan- titative analysis had been con- ducted at this point, so that Stanford's claims of significant findings at this time make no sense at all — except in terms 16 of what he wanted to believe. A major myth purveyed by Stanford is the impression he leaves that I more or less twisted his arm to have the analysis done by Dr. Frankel at the NASA facility and that he was just going along with my decision. (\"Hall, apparently, was sure that the metallurgist... was the man to do the job.\" p. 116 \"I felt the decision to take it to Goddard was a judicious one, trusting Richard Hall's judgment.\" p. 117). As the record of our correspondence clearly shows, the judgment was Stanford's. Several options were open to him and I repeatedly asked him which he preferred. We had initially suggested the Smith- sonian Laboratories in Cam- bridge, Mass., where Walt Webb had indicated the analy- sis could be done under his direct supervision. On May 5, 1964, Stanford wrote me that he might be able to have the analysis done locally at Phoe- nix, Arizona. I replied May 8th: \"If you can persuade compe- tent local scientists to analyze the remaining metal samples, and have assurance that a public report would be avail- able, that would probably be the best arrangement.\" For reasons of his own, Stanford chose to have the analysis done at Goddard and he did so with the foreknow* ledge that (as I had told him in my letter of June 25, 1964) \"He (Frankel) stated he had done analysis of alleged UFO arti- facts for the government...\" When Stanford quotes from this letter (p. 117) to establish how he \"had just been per- suaded\" to have the analysis done at Goddard, he omits this sentence about Frankel's prior connection with governmental UFO analyses. By selective quoting, Stan- ford leaves the false impression that I led him down the primrose path. When he states (p. 151) that I told him in 1975 of \"later\" discovering that Frankel had worked closely with the FBI, this is a grossly misleading distortion of what I said; I was simply reminding him of what we both knew at the time. He uses this distortion in conjunction with the claim that I said I \"could believe\" there had been a cover-up in- volving Frankel to suggest that I now recognized the error of my ways. All I said was that I did not rule out that possibility entirely, but that is a far cry from \"believing\" that it hap- pened, which I do not. Stanford (p. 151-152) charac- terizes my published report on the analysis as \"highly dis- torted\" and accuses me of \"intellectual dishonesty\" in the way it was reported. I published the results of the one and only analysis report ever given to me by the NASA scientists, and that analysis concluded exactly what I said it did. The reader may wish to compare the intel- lectual honesty of that with Stanford's treatment of salient facts in the instances cited above. His entire case rests on two apparently undocumented and unverifiable alleged phone calls that only he can witness. In addition, no one else involved in the Socorro investigation re- members the startling (and presumably unforgettable) pos- itive NASA analysis report that"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"only Stanford remembers. In 1964, NICAP's position that UFOs appeared to be extraterrestrial was well- known, and I was the officer responsible for all NICAP pub- licity at the time as Acting Director. To have been instru- mental in proving the case with physical evidence would have been a feather in my cap; undoubtedly I would have gone down in history as leader ofthr organization and personal par- ticipant in the historical event that gave the world this proof. If I had been toK by Frankel what Stanford claims I was told, I would have had every reason to spread the spectacu- lar news to mv NICAP col- leagues. No one. at NICAP (in- cluding Major Donald E. Key- hoe, Don Berliner, and Walt Webb) recalls any such news. The Socorro Symbol Not much space will be taken commenting on Stanford's cur- ious reasoning about the \"in- signia\" or symbol, about which he again accuses me of mis- leading everyone. As I told Stanford on the phone, his presentation on this subject is \"a total red herring.\" There is no doubt whatsoever about the authenticity of the symbol that has been published, and in his zeal to find conspiracy and cover-up Stanford ignores ab- solute proof that exists both in Air Force and private files. Stanford never offered at the time, and still does not offer, any compelling evidence to the contrary. Instead, he seizes on distorted information from second- and third-hand sources and values that equally with first-hand and documented in- formation. His entire treatment of the symbol is, to me, re- vealing evidence of the way his mind works in fanning the flames of conspiracy, no matter how faint the burning ember or how overwhelming the prepon- derance of evidence to the contrary. It is ironic that Stanford hints at more cover-up (p. 42) by reporting that Capt. Holder suggested to Zamora that he not discuss the symbol publicly. Holder's reason for this should appeal to Stanford: \"Holder said he reasoned that if the symbol were kept from public knowledge and subsequent rec- ords of the same symbol on an object should reach the auth- orities, then the government investigators would know that they were dealing with authen- tic reports.\" Stanford probably has for- gotten a letter dated May 3, 1964 that he sent to me at NICAP, since it was hand- written on notebook paper:and he may not have retained a copy. In it he suggested: \"I advise not letting out the real (as told in tape by Mike Martinez) description of symbol on UFO, so if person(s) claim UFO 'contact' with or on side we can suspect a hoax, while anyone giving the real (& unpublished) description would tend to authenticate himself. Do you see my reasoning?\" If what's sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander, then we have documented .evidence of Ray Stanford suggesting a UFO cover-up. (We ignored this ad- vice since our interest was in publishing the facts about what Zamora had seen). Unless it is another error by Stanford, this letter clearly implies that he considered the alternative sym- bol to be a hoax in 1964. On May 5, 1964, I wrote to Stan- ford and concluded the letter with this sentence: \"By the way, I offer you the real red marking (symbol) on the UFO obtained from Zamora on the telephone \" Stanford never disputed in 1964 what came to be the accepted symbol, so his effort to do so 12 years later is highly suspect. Ray Stanford: Psychic/Scientists In order to understand how Stanford's persuasively written account of the Socorro case might be bent and twisted by his biases, one must know something about Stanford. He is best known today, as he presents himself in the book as the scientific \"brains\" behind Project Starlight International (PSI), near Austin, Texas, with sophisticated equipment de- signed to track and record UFOs. This facet of his seeming dual personality explains why I trusted Stanford to investigate Socorro on behalf of NICAP in 1964. I was aware at the time of his flirtations with well-known \"contactees\" and his subse- quent disowning of them, and even of his alleged psychic contact and visual sighting, with other witnesses, of a UFO in November 1954. That did not involve any claimed face-to-face or verbal contact. What I did not know at the time, and not until reported to me by Walt Webb in 1976, was that Stan- ford himself was a full-fledged \"contactee.\" In Robert J. Crib- ble's Flying Saucer Review for September 1956, Stanford had an article entitled \"Is It Not 17"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"Time?\" In it he asserted that George Adamski was among \"those sincere and steadfast ones who have met our visitors face to face,\" and that stories like Adamski's \"have stood the test of time.\" He went on to say, \"The readers of the Review know that I personally was privileged to have a contact with these people on November 6, 1954... Most of you, however, do not know that since that time I have been granted other contacts with these more evolved visitors from other planets. These con- tacts have given me (and others who have been contacted) a greater insight than I had ever dreamed possible. We have learned many things which have surprised even us. We know that these visitors can and will contact those who are ready — those with receptive minds. Never underestimate their abil- ity to contact!\" Stanford has never shared with us what allegedly trans- pired during these contacts, nor what \"surprising\" things he learned. A veiled reference to these mid-1950's experiences appears in the Socorro book (p. 152-153), totally glossing over his claim at the time of having been singled out for contact because of his \"receptive mind.\" Instead, he refers to these alleged experiences as \"a couple of close-range sight- ings.\" Does he now renounce his former claims of privileged contact with spacemen? If he does, to what does he attribute them? Self-delusion? In 1975 Stanford took out an ad in the National Enquirer offering to sell tape cassettes of \"voices\" obtained by him 18 through \"a meditation-induced unconscious state\" from people calling themselves \"Brothers.\" (Adamski and other \"con- tactees\" claimed to be con- tacted by \"Space Brothers.\") Stanford apparently passion- ately desires to obtain objective proof of these subjective ex- periences, hence his commit- ment to the Socorro sample being \"metallic\" even before any analysis was done and his ultra-scientific UFO tracking station. Conclusions In the Socorro book Stanford presents conspiracy theories based on his presupposition that he, in fact, had metallic traces of a UFO. NASA's failure to confirm this could only be explained by a cover- up. It is apparent to me that, far from \"verbatim\" quotes, Stanford has paraphrased re- marks out of context, and taken serious liberties in doing so. His psychic and \"contactee\" back- ground and his conspiratorial turn of mind give me little confidence that he, alone, has succeeded in uncovering truth where others have failed. In- stead, I see in his writings example after example of \"reading into\" events that which he is already prone to believe. He shows every evi- dence of what I prefer to call \"systematic self-delusion\" ra- ther than malicious intent. The Socorro case is a strong one, and not all the facts have come out yet about analyses done on other samples obtained at the site or full testimony from other witnesses. Despite its good summary of the basic facts of the case, however, this book introduces false issues and serves more to confuse than to enlighten. My views and beliefs are amply documented in the UFO literature. I would have pre- ferred that the NASA analysis show an unknown metal indi- cating an extraterrestrial source. But to the best of my knowledge, that is not what sci- entific analysis of Ray Stan- ford's Socorro sample showed. (Con tinued from page 20) slinging (IN CAPITAL LET- TERS) emanates from a highly biased source, convinced in advance that any report of \"spacemen\" has to be a hoax, and must be filtered accord- ingly. APRO's response has already cast the allegedly sup- pressed polygraph test in a different light. The case is too complex to review here, but a careful reappraisal excluding polemics and concentrating on critical points of evidence seems to be needed. * * * I would like to thank Glenn Welker, Fred Merritt, and Bar- bara Mathey for contributions of cancelled foreign stamps to exchange for U.S. postage.

Starting in late August of 1896, the catalog, dubbed \"HumCat\" by Ted and Dave, has all reports identified by year, case number, date, time, location, an alpha type classification, a brief description, the investigators name if known, and the source of the report. This is without a doubt one of the most comprehensive humanoid catalogs com- piled to date. Ted and Dave are to be congratulated for a superb research achievement in this specialized field. Credit must be also given to Lex Mebane who assited Ted in the finished product. MUFON and the JOURNAL extend our appreciation for \"a job well done\". We also want to express our thanks to the large number of UFO researchers worldwide who provided case information for this magnificent endeavor. November 5, 6, and 7th marked the dates for the \"National Research and Investigation Conference\" sponsored by the British UFO Research and In- vestigation Conference\" sponsored by the British UFO Research Association (BUFORA), held at the Birmingham Centre Hotel in Birmingham, England. They were assisted by members of the UFO Studies Information Service (UFOSIS) and the Northern UFO Net- work (NUFON). The international scope of this UFO COnference was reflected in the choice of the featured evening speaker, Mr. Ted Bloecher, representing the United States, but in particular as MUFON's State Director for New York and Co-Chairman of MUFON's Humanoid Study Group. Ted titled his presentation \"The Humanoids - An Analysis of UFO Occupant Cases\". A tape recorded presentation by Dr. J. Allen Hynek on \"Current UFO Resear- ch\" followed Ted's lecture. Many of our JOURNAL readers will remember the outstanding illustrated lecture that Mr. Bloecher gave at the \"1975 MUFON UFO Symposium\" in Des Moines, Iowa. Other fine speakers giving papers on diverse UFO subjects were Peter Roger- son - \"INTCAT - An International Catalogue of Type I UFO Reports\"; Jack Webber - \"The Alphabet of UFO Reports\"; Bernard Delair (MUFON's Representative for England) - \"UFO Waves and Their Prediction\"; Anthony Pace - \"The Vehicle Interference Ef- fect\"; Robert Digby - \"They Shoot UFO's - Don't They 0 \"; Tim O'Brien - \"A Unified Extra-Terrestrial Hypothesis in Explanation of the UFO Phenomenon\"; Roy Dutton - \"An Objective Analysis of the UFO Phenomenon\"; Mark Stenhoff - \"A Projected Study of Fluid Vortex Rings and Plasma Phenomena as Ex- planatory Hypothesis for the UFO\"; and Ian Grant - \"The UFO Problem - Solved\". hi addition to the formal papers that were presented, Group Sessions were held on the following research techniques with leaders as indicated: \"Investigation Procedure and Techniques\", Robert Digby, Steve Gamble and John Shaw; \"Data Processing, Cataloging and Case Documentation\", Jenny Randies; and \"Instrumental Detection of the UFO Phenomenon\", Charles Lockwood and Anthony Pace. The success of this con- ference must be attributed to the con- ference organizers—Miss Jenny Ran- dies (NUFON), Mr. Philip Rogers (UFOSIS) and Mr. Roger Stanway (BUFORA) for their fine planning and motivation. Ted Bloecher's written report on his visit to England includes not only the people he met at the BUFORA Con- ference, but personal visits with many folks that are well known on the UFO scene such as Julian Hennessey in Belgravia; Charles Bowen, Editor of the Flying Saucer Review; Eileen Buckle, Gordon Creighton, John Lade and Brian Winder, FSR Staff Members; Bernard Delair, Director of Contact UK; and John Rimmer and Peter Rogerson, Editors of MUFOB (The Merseyside UFO Bulletin). Ted's evaluation of BUFORA Con- ference may be summed up in the following manner: \"I found the con- ference similar in nearly all respects to the best of the MUFON Symposia of recent years; the degree of interest and involvement was high, and the par- ticipants serious about efforts to im- prove investigate and research techniques\". According to Ted, among the most interesting and valuable documents made available at the Con- ference for the benefit of BUFORA in- vestigators was the just released \"UFO INVESTIGATION - A HANDBOOK FOR UFO INVESTIGATORS\"- a production on a scale that rivals MUFON's \"FIELD INVESTIGATOR'S MANUAL\". A copy of MUFON's manual was mailed to Bernard Delair as an aid in producing their handbook. November 1976 ushered in a new monthly publication to the UFO field-the INTERNATIONAL UFO REPORTER with Dr. J. Allen Hynek as Editor-in-chief and Allan Hendry, Managing Editor. Even though IUR is operated as a separate corporation, it will be the communications media for the Center for UFO Studies. In the first edition (8 pages), Dr. Hynek sets forth the purposes and philosophy of this new publication in an article tided \"Estimate of the Situation\". When the Center for UFO Studies was organized in 1974, MUFON was the only major UFO organization to pledge it's support and has demonstrated that cooperation for the past two years. We are very cognizant that the IUR will be in direct competition to THE MUFON UFO JOURNAL. However, we welcome that 19"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"competition, because the ultimate benefits will be accrued by UFO resear- chers in having available not only higher caliber publications for the readers, but an opportunity to share their investigative and research ac- complishments via published papers. The professional caliber staff members of THE MUFON UFO JOURNAL welcome the INTERNATIONAL UFO REPORTER to the UFO scene, because we recognize that both publications can fill a specific and distinct need. The JOURNAL (formerly SKYLOOK) has established itself as one of the leading UFO publications in the world today, therefore we are going to be trying even harder to maintain and justify that prestigious reputation. Recently, George Eberhart, a graduate student at the University of Chicago conducted a survey to assess the level of activity of workers in the UFO field and document the kind and types of sources utilized. Four hundred eighty-four questionnaires were sent out to active researchers in May and 33 per cent of them responded. The survey disclosed two items of major interest to MUFON members; (1) The most popular UFO Journals turned out to be APRO Bulletin, Flying Saucer Review, and SKYLOOK and (2) James Mc- Campbell's book \"UFOLOGY\" ranked in the top five for UFO books con- sidered absolutely basic for any library. Dr. Hynek's \"UFO Experience\" held a significant lead. We have just complied with a request by \"The Institute of Scientific In- formation of the U.S.S.R. Academy of Sciences\" for a specimen copy of SKYLOOK to be studied with the view of reviewing it in their published AB- STRACTS JOURNAL. Issues No. 103 and 105 of THE MUFON UFO JOUR- NAL were submitted. Widespread publicity would occur if the review was published. Their goal is to supply their readers with maximum information about the latest achievements in science and technology. It is gratifying to know that SKYLOOK came to the attention of this scientific body. RECAPPING AND COMMENTING By Richard Hall (MUFON International Coordinator) (Comments in this month's column are based, in part, on articles appearing in the July 1976 MUFON UFO Journal) As everybody realizes by now, MUFON has had serious tran- sition problems following Dwight Connelly's resignation as editor and Dennis Hauck assuming double duty editing Official UFO and MUFON UFO Journal. Some printing problems contributed to delays, and I can envision Director Walt Andrus chewing on ulcer pills. Happily, the worst seems to be past and Dennis is rapidly catching up. However, one thing is obvious: MUFON spec- ialists, State Directors, and others, are failing to produce articles and summary reports for publication. MUFON and the Journal cannot succeed without better cooperation from active mem- bers who use the information they obtain for private research purposes. MUFON encourages such use, but the users have a strong .responsibility to share that information. This means taking time to write up sig- nificant cases, summary re- ports, and newsnotes in manu- script form (typed, double- spaced) and submit it to the Editor. One manuscript of four or five pages from each of you once a month would make all the difference in the world to the Journal. If you can't write (and I've never heard of anyone who thought he or she couldn't write), at least send newspaper clippings and news of any UFO related programs or activities in your area. * * * Reading the latest polemic about the Travis Walton case, by Phil Klass, I can only repeat that it is an outstanding ex- ample of how not to go about UFO investigations. The \"com- mitted\" positions and ax-grind- ing continue to shed more heat than light on the situation. At this point, no one has proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the case is either (a) genuine or (b) a hoax. In fact, as I've said before, there is no reason why we should rush to an \"either- or\" judgment. Klass' mud- (Continued on page 18) IMark R.
