FROM THE EDITOR Since we live in an unblushing, self-serving and self- advertising society, I hope Journal readers will not take too much offense at the sound of my own horn. The occasion is the publication of my modest booklet, The Marfa Lights: A Viewer's Guide. As you will know if you read my earlier article on the sub- ject in the Journal (Nov., 1987), the Marfa Lights of west Texas are but a local example of a generic global phenomenon known as \"ghost lights,\" normally spherical balls of light that dance or hover near the ground, and which may serve as-the impetus for some UFO sightings. The booklet is designed to replace the one presently sold in the visitors' center of the University of Texas McDonald Observatory, atop nearby Mt. Locke. An anecdotal and historical survey of what is and is not known about the Marfa Lights, the 14-page Viewer's Guide includes instructions for finding the Lights, three pages of Recommended Reading for armchair enthusiasts, original art and design, and three exclusive photographs, two of automobile headlights, which are routinely mistaken for the Lights, and at least one (by James Crocker of Dallas), which appears to be authentic. The Guide can be ordered directly from (me) the author, or (me) the publisher, at Box 12434, San Antonio, Texas, 78212. The cost, including pos- tage and handling, is $3. Your copy will arrive in a plain, brown wrapper.

In March of 1989, Hastings mailed out the following cover article, accompanied by num- erous additional enclosures, to forty-three individuals, from An- drus to Zechel, including the edi- tor of this journal. The reasons for making it public should be obvious upon reading. Unfortunately, space constraints make it impossible for us to reproduce all of the enclo- sures referenced. However, Wil- liam Moore has been apprised of publication, and offered space in these pages in which to respond. Facts First, it has been established that \"Falcon,\" one of the principle sources of the MJ-12 material, is Richard C. Doty, formerly attached to District 17 Air Force Office of Special Investiga- tions (AFOSI) at Kirtland Air Force Base, Albuquerque, New Mexico. Sgt. Doty retired from the U.S. Air Force on October 1, 1988. How do I know that Doty is \"Fal- con\"? During a recent telephone con- versation, Linda Moulton Howe told me that when Sgt. Doty invited her to his office at Kirtland AFB in early April 1983, and showed her a pur- portedly authentic U.S. Government document on UFOs, he identified himself as code-name \"Falcon\" and stated that it was Bill Moore who had given him that name. Also, in early December 1988, a ranking member of the production team responsible for the \"UFO Cover Up? — Live\" television documentary confirmed that Doty is \"Falcon.\" This same individual also identified the second MJ-12 source who appeared on the program, \"Condor\", as Robert Collins who was, until recently, a MUFON UFO Journal, No. 254, June 1989 By Robert Hastings Captain in the U.S. Air Force. Like Doty, he was stationed at KAFB when he left the service late last year. Both Doty and Collins deny any involvement in the MJ-12 affair. How- ever, Linda Howe has issued a sworn affidavit, agreeing to testify under penalty of perjury, relating to the events during the course of her meet- ing with Richard \"Falcon\" Doty at KAFB in 1983 (Enclosures A and B). Thus far, Doty has not issued a sworn affidavit, or agreed to testify under penalty of perjury, to reenforce his denial that the events of his meet- ing with Howe occurred as she had described them. For the moment, I will not identify the \"UFO Cover Up? — Live\" source who identified Doty as \"Falcon\" and Collins as \"Condor\". I do, however, encourage others to independently attempt to secure confirmation of the statements that he has already made. At least two producers connected with the documentary know the facts. Questions Now that \"Falcon\" and \"Condor\" have been identified, it seems prudent to examine the past activities of Richard Doty and Bob Collins to see whether those activities tend to add to, or detract from, the credibility of the MJ-12 scenario that they have so vigorously promoted within the ufo- logical community. That is, do their actions reflect a genuine attempt to release authentic above top secret information to the public or, on the other hand, suggest a disinformation campaign designed to confuse and mislead? Let's begin with Doty. Sgt. Richard Charles Doty first received wides- pread attention after he wrote the now well-known AFOSI Complaint Form relating to UFO sightings near Kirtland AFB in 1980 (Enclosure C). This document, typed and signed by Doty, takes on new significance in the light of an incident known as the \"Weitzel Hoax\". Briefly summarized, this odd tale unfolded as follows: In 1981, the Aerial Phenomena Research Organization received an anonymous letter from an individual who claimed to be a USAF airman assigned to the 1550th Aircrew Training and Testing Wing at Kirtland AFB (Enclosure D). The writer further claimed to have had a rather dramatic UFO sighting, together with a Craig Weitzel and others. The letter relates that Weitzel reported the sighting to a \"Mr. Dody\" (sic) at Kirtland AFB OSI. Researcher Benton Jamison located and contacted Weitzel in 1985 (Enclo- sure E). Weitzel stated that he did indeed report a UFO sighting to Sgt. Richard Doty in 1980, but that the actual incident in no way resembled the CEIII experience described in the anonymous letter. Weitzel also denies that he was subsequently contacted by a mysterious individual who demand- ed that he turn over any photographs that he might have taken of the UFO, as the letter claims. So, it would appear that the writer of the anonymous letter, whomever he was, took a real event and greatly embellished it for some reason. And why is this letter so significant as regards questions about Sgt. Rich- ard Doty's credibility as a source for allegedly secret government docu- ments? Simply because careful analy- sis of the anonymous letter reveals that it was almost certainly typed on the same typewriter used by Doty to complete the 1980 OSI Complaint Form. Enclosure F is a report by research- er Brad Sparks which addresses type- face irregularities and stylistic traits that are identical in both the ano- nymous airman's letter and Sgt. Doty's report. Actually, Sparks' typeface analy- sis is incomplete. Ip addition to the irregular \"u\" that he identifies, it can 3"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"be seen that the letters \"gh\", as in the word \"sighting\", are jammed together in identical fashion in both the letter and the report. Lower case \"o\" is also jammed against various letters that follow it in both the \"Weitzel\" letter and Doty's Complaint Form. A professionally-conducted analysis of these flaws should be able to determine, with a reasonable degree of certainty, whether the \"anonymous airman\" used Doty's typewriter to compose his over- blown tale. If this fact can be estab- lished then two obvious questions arise: 1) How and why did the unidentified airman from the 1550th Aircrew Train- ing and Testing Wing gain access to Sgt. Doty's typewriter at OSI? 2) On the other hand, did Doty himself type the letter and, therefore, attempt to perpetrate a hoax for some as yet unknown reason? Because it has been established that Richard Doty is \"Falcon\", a chief source for the MJ-12 material, it now seems imperative to thoroughly inves- tigate this incident to resolve these unanswered questions. The second question, in particular, is of obvious importance. Perhaps the Fund for UFO Research, which has recently solicited contributions to further investi- gate the MJ-12 affair, would consider funding an expert typographical anal- ysis of both the anonymous letter and Doty's Complaint Form to determine whether or not there is a link between the two. Even more disturbing than the implications of the \"Weitzel Hoax\" is an incident that raises the strongest doubts about Richard Doty's credibil- ity as a source of information and documents relating to the U.S. Govern- ment's involvement with UFOs. Informa- tion about this incident comes from Dr. Bruce Maccabee and links Doty to the so-called Ellsworth AFB hoax. According to Maccabee, Bill Moore has acknowledged that Richard Doty confessed to forging the document that describes the alleged events con- nected with the Ellsworth case (Enclo- sure G). Doty apparently claims that the UFO incident there actually occur- red, just as described in the docu- ment, and that he only wanted to bring it to public attention. He, there- fore, proceeded to type the \"doc- ument\" himself, incorporating the 4 \"facts\" that he claimed to know to be true, and. then released the bogus report to various researchers. Enclo- sure H is an expose written by Bob Pratt, and published in the January 1984 issue of the MUFON Journal, describing his investigation of this hoax. If it can be established, beyond any doubt, that Richard Doty forged the Ellsworth AFB document, what would that say about his credibility as a chief source for the MJ-12 material, under the guise of \"Falcon\"? More Questions In addition to the serious questions raised by the \"Weitzel\" letter and the Ellsworth AFB hoax, there also exist fundamental discrepancies between information provided by \"Falcon\" and the \"facts\" contained in the so-called Eisenhower briefing paper. The Briefing Document (Enclosure I) was purportedly written by alleged MJ-12 member Admiral Roscoe Hil- lenkoetter, in November 1952, for presentation to then President elect Dwight D. Eisenhower. Among other things, it states that two UFOs had crashed, one in July 1947, near Ros- well, New Mexico; the other in December 1950, on the Texas-Mexico border. Linda Howe states, however, that when Sgt. Doty invited her to his office at Kirtland AFB OSI, in April 1983, he provided her with informa- tion that contradicts this version of events. Howe states that Doty con- firmed the existence of a secret government group called MJ-12 and then opened a desk drawer and pro- duced a document entitled \"Briefing Paper for the President of the United States.\" (Not the Eisenhower document.) Howe states that she was allowed to look through the alleged \"Briefing Paper\" but told not to take notes. She states that part of the document was a catalog of crashed UFO cases, including one near Aztec, New Mex- ico in 1948 (or '49). Now, if the Eisenhower briefing paper is genuine and was indeed presented to Ike in November 1952, why was no mention of the Aztec crash contained in it? Is it plausible that the soon-to-be president would be let in on a secret of paramount importance — that of alien visitation — but not given this important information? Why would he be told about two UFO crashes but not about a third? Why would the Aztec crash, if it did occur, be any less significant than the other two cases mentioned in the briefing paper? In short, if the briefing paper that Sgt. Doty showed to Linda Howe was genuine, what does that say about the accuracy (and authenticity) of the Eisenhower document? If, on the other hand, the former was bogus and was meant to mislead Howe for some reason, what does that say about Richard \"Falcon\" Doty's relia- bility as a source for MJ-12 material as a whole? At the risk of being redundant, may I again point out that Linda Howe has sworn out an affidavit indicating a wil- lingness to testify, under penalty of perjury, as to the truthfulness of her statements relating to her meeting with \"Falcon\" at Kirtland OSI. About Robert \"Bob\" Collins, I know very little. I have established that at the time of his departure from the U.S. Air force, he was assigned to the Plasma Physics group at Sandia National Laboratories, located at Kir- tland AFB. Linda Howe states that in November 1987, Collins was \"franti- cally\" trying to get her to meet with him in Albuquerque. At that meeting, also attended by John Lear, Collins showed the two some MJ-12 docu- ments, primarily relating to a live alien allegedly held captive by the U.S. Government. According to Howe, Collins stated that he had worked \"behind the scenes\" with Bill Moore for years. Moore Questions So, how does Mr. Moore fit into the MJ-12 jigsaw puzzle? On the face of it, he appears to be just a UFO researcher who has been approached by questionable government sources. I have information, however, that raises doubts about his public image as merely a \"civilian\" researcher. Indeed, it appears as if he may be working (or have worked) for one of the U.S. intelligence agencies. I base this statement on the following informa- tion: In December 1985, I read an article by Barry Greenwood about an alleged- MUFON UFO Journal, No. 254, June 1989"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Quest Research Enclosure F 1723 HASTE ST..

Doty, 8 Sep 80 (C) \"Frequency Jamming,\" Alleged AFOSI Complaint Form, ca. 14 Aug 80 After extensive analysis of photocopies of the above-cited three documents (A, B and C), it is my conclusion that they probably were composed and/or typed by the same person using the same typewriter. Document B presumably is a genuine document, having been officially released in 1962 by the U.S. Air Force under the terms of the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S. Code 552). Therefore, the author of Document B, AFOSI Special Agent Richard C. Doty, or some associate or subordinate of Doty's who makes official records in his name, probably is the author of Documents A and C. The evidence for the identity of authorship is that each of the three documents (A, B and C) displays the following peculiar electromechanical and stylistic traits in common: 1. Misalignment of lower case letter \"u\" so that it is shifted slightly below the level of the rest of the letters in every line of type in each of Documents A, B and C. The amount of misalignment is on the order of 0.1 millimeter. In light of points 2 and 3 below, this is indicative of an electromechanical fault probably characteristic of one specific typewriter. 2. Absence of any other systematic or frequent letter misalignments or peculiarities in each of Documents A, B and C. 3. Use of Esquire 10 (Pica) Typestyle in each of Docu- ments A, B and C. A. Unusual personal stylistic trait where the numerals for tine and the abbreviations \"hrs.\" or \"AM\" are joined without a space in between. These appear in Document A: \"10;45AM\" (sic) \"2210hrs.\" Document B: \"2350hrs.\" \"0020hrs.\" Document C: \"2215hrs.\" \"2216hrs.\" This analyst has reviewed tens of thousands of pages of U.S. 'Air Force records Including several thousand pages of AFOSI (Air Force Office of Special Investigations) records, which in tarn Included several hundred pages of AFOSI documents from Doty's District 17 Office. Not a single instance of such a stylistic trait is recalled. 5. Stylistic trait of blacking out or penning in corrections to misspellings and typographical errors. Examples appear only in Documents A and B (2 and 5 instances, respectively) as Document C apparently was short enough and sufficiently accurate in typography as to not need such corrections.  / Brad Sparks Director MUFON UFO Journal, No. 254, June 1989"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Enclosure H MUFON UFO JOURNAL NUMBER 191 JANUARY 1984 FowvkdlK? .OFFICIAL PUBLICATION OF MUTUAL UFO MKTWOMC, MC., $150 '..• 3.

The article was based on information provided by researcher Lee Graham. In March 1986, I met with Mr. Graham at his home, in the hope that he would elaborate on the infor- mation contained in Greenwood's arti- cle. I found Graham to be open, hon- est, and sincere. While I do not agree with many of his conclusions regard- ing MJ-12, I know that he is definitely not the \"kook\" or \"space cadet\" that some have branded him. On the con- trary, his statements to me that even- ing were logical and down-to-earth. I simply disagree with some of his premises. As we talked, Lee provided me with copies of some of the \"docu- ments\" that have come to be asso- ciated with the MJ-12 affair, including the \"Project Snowbird\" paper and the \"Project Aquarius\" TWX. When I asked who had given him the docu- ments, he would only say that the person worked for the government, as an intelligence operative or infor- mation conduit. Over the next fifteen months I called Graham several times, to ask whether there had been any devel- opments regarding the MJ-12 matter. Perhaps the most noteworthy event during that period was the visit to Graham by two agents from the Defense Investigative Service (DIS). The agents were apparently sent to find out why Graham, who holds a \"Q\" security clearance, was in pos- session of allegedly secret govern- ment documents that had not been properly declassified. In early June 1987, I called Lee again. This was shortly before Bill Moore's press conference in Burbank, during which he intended to unveil the \"Eisenhower briefing paper\" and other MJ-12 material. During this call, without any prompting from me, Graham revealed that the person who had given him the documents was in fact Bill Moore. I was puzzled. Gra- ham had previously said, on several occasions, that he had gotten the documents from an individual who worked for the U.S. Government, presumably in an intelligence capac- ity. As far as I knew, Bill Moore did not work for the government in any capacity. MUFON UFO Journal, No. 254, June 1989 I asked Graham to explain this dis- crepancy. He unhesitatingly replied that when Moore first approached him with the documents, he (Moore) showed him some kind of government ID card, with Bill Moore's picture on it but an alias typed beneath it. According to Graham, Moore indi- cated that he was working for the U.S. Government for the purpose of releasing sensitive UFO-related doc- uments to the public. I began to take notes. So incredu- lous was I about all of this that I asked Lee to repeat his statements, which he did. I then asked him which agency Moore claimed to work for. He responded that Bill Moore's ID badge was identical to the badges shown him by the DIS agents. When I skeptically retorted, \"You mean to tell me that Moore's badge looked like the DIS badges?\" he replied, \"No, it was identical to them.\" Graham went on to state that Moore claimed that he (Moore) had been \"flagged\" in U.S. intelligence agencies' computer files so that other operatives would not stumble over and inadvertently expose his opera- tions. Lee went on to say that he had once been introduced to Moore's \"superior\" whom Moore would only identify as \"Richard\". At the conclusion of this rather baf- fling phone conversation with Gra- ham, I specifically asked him whether there was anything that we had dis- cussed that I should not repeat. He answered, \"No\", and indicated that he would send me materials relating to his investigation by the DIS, Bill Moore's first approach to him, and other, related matters. A week later, I received the items that Graham had promised and found that references to Moore, by name, had been cen- sored by Lee. By this time, however, I had already spoken to Barry Green- wood, Peter Gersten, Bob Todd, and others about the details of Moore's approach to Graham. Apparently word got back to Moore about these con- versations because I later heard that he had vehemently denied that he was a government operative and claimed that he was only playing a \"joke\" on a gullible Lee Graham. The \"government ID\", according to Moore, was a laminated MUFON card. Enclosure J is a letter, dated May 8, 1986, that Graham sent to the DIS in which he discusses Moore's first approach to him. Graham mentions that when he was interviewed by the two DIS agents, he told them about Moore and his ID card. Graham then goes on to ask why Moore had not been interrogated about his posses- sion of allegedly secret government documents, copies of which he had given to Graham. (One might also ask why Moore had not been questi- oned about his impersonating a govern- ment agent, if in fact his ID card was bogus as he now claims.) Enclosure K is a second letter from Graham to the DIS, dated October 19, 1986, exactly seven months after Lee was interviewed by the two DIS agents. In it, Graham again mentions that Moore has not been interrogated by the DIS over this lengthy period. He concludes that it is because Moore does indeed work for the U.S. Government, just as he had been told by Moore himself. Graham has a point. If Moore was only \"joking\" when he showed Lee the bogus ID card (an ID that looked so authentic that Graham calls it \"identical\" to a DIS badge) one would think that Moore would have been questioned by the DIS about this potentially serious matter. If Moore was impersonating a government intel- ligence operative as he disseminated \"documents\", then surely some intel- ligence agency would be interested in pursuing the matter. And yet, accord- ing to Lee Graham, seven months after he had told the DIS about Moore and his badge, no one had apparently approached Moore about this incident. Why? One might reasonably postulate that this apparent lack of follow-up by the DIS suggests that Moore does (or did) work for the U.S. Government, just as he claimed to Lee Graham. If this turns out to be true, however, given the highly questionable track record of one of Moore's chief sour- ces, \"Falcon,\" one must ask whether it is information, or disinformation, that he has been disseminating. In this regard, one might also ask why did Moore not immediately disasso- ciate himself from Richard Doty once he had discovered that Doty had 7"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"forged the Ellsworth AFB document? Instead, Moore later presented Richard \"Falcon\" Doty on national television as a reliable intelligence source of information about UFOs. Why? Another serious issue involving Bill Moore that needs to be resolved con- cerns the so-called \"Project Aquarius\" document (Enclosure L). This paper contains the first reference to \"MJ- 12\" to be widely circulated within the ufological community. On the face of it, the Project Aqua- rius document is a teletype message, sent by AFOSI Headquarters to Kir- tland AFB OSI, dealing with analyses of UFO photographs and films taken by Dr. Paul Bennewitz. However, AFOSI HQ denies that it sent the mes- sage and calls it a forgery. It now appears that, in this case, AFOSI is telling the truth. In a letter to attorney Peter Gersten, dated April 4, 1983, Dick Hall states that Bill Moore privately admitted that it was he who did a \"cut and paste job\" and then \"retyped\" the docu- ment (Enclosure M). If this is true, why would Moore do such a thing? If a genuine message was sent to Kir- tland AFB OSI, dealing with Benne- witz' photos, MJ-12, and the rest, why didn't Moore disseminate it in its original form? Wouldn't the \"retyped\" version of it, if discovered to be such, raise doubts about the credibility of the information contained in it? If Moore did \"retype\" the docu- ment, can he now produce the origi- nal to substantiate the accuracy of the information contained in \"his\" version? If so, it will be interesting to see whether the \"original\" document will be confirmed as authentic by AFOSI Headquarters. I should point out that I possess additional information about the Pro- ject Aquarius document that I intend to withhold until Moore has produced (or failed to produce) the \"original.\" Response to Moore's Open Letter Just as I was concluding this mis- sive, I received a copy of Bill Moore's open letter to those who would ques- tion his activities. In response to his criticisms and pleas, I would like to make the following points: First, Moore states that he is not a \"forger,\" a \"hoaxer,\" a \"fabricator,\" 8 or a \"counterfeiter.\" Whether he is any of those things, I will leave to others to decide. I would ask, how- ever, if he could suggest an approp- riate word to describe his actions when he did a cut/paste/retype job on the Aquarius document? If Moore believed that he was \"the only one on the right track,\" as Doty flattered him, then that's his problem. If, how- ever, he has engaged in the altering of government documents before releas- ing them to an unsuspecting public, then that becomes a problem for all of us. The credibility of any docu- ment, even when released via the Freedom of Information Act, will come into question in the minds of many once it has been learned that a \"lead- ing ufologist\" has tampered with this or that document. And yet, Moore has the absolute nerve to rail against those who would question his \"methods\". Second, Moore feigns self-righteous indignation when he denies that he is \"some sort of government agent.\" But clearly, he has only himself to blame for this \"rumor\". // the ID badge that he showed Lee Graham was fake, and if he was lying when he claimed to be an intelligence operative, does he now have any right to bemoan the fact that his escapade has finally come to light? I, for one, do not believe for an instant Moore's lami- nated MLJFON card story. That explan- ation smacks of the ridiculous \"red herring\" about there being two Richard Dotys that Moore offered up when the \"Falcon\"/Doty connection was first suggested publicly by Barry Green- wood in 1987. While I am sure that there are plenty of Richard Dotys in this world, only one is the MJ-12 source \"Falcon.\" Third, Moore calls efforts by research- ers to learn the identities of his MJ-12 sources \"inappropriate\" and states that for \"obvious reasons\" his response to these inquiries will be \"no com- ment.\" This posture, of course, also conveniently shields from scrutiny the fact that his \"primary\" source for the MJ-12 material, Richard Doty, has apparently acknowledged forging the Ellsworth AFB document — a fact that Moore himself knew at least as early as March 1988. In view of this revelation, the attempt by Moore to project the appearance that he is merely protecting a confidential govern- ment source rings hollow. Indeed, it seems likely that his desire to avoid embarrassment and well-deserved re- criminations is a chief motive for his \"no comment\" stance. Summary So, what does the MJ-12 affair add up to? I agree with Bill Moore: it would be premature at this time to draw conclusions. It would not, how- ever, be premature to carefully con- sider the following facts: • 1) A handful of \"documents\" have mysteriously surfaced relating to an allegedly ultra-secret UFO policy group, code-name \"MJ-12\". No govern- ment agency will confirm the papers' authenticity and the National Archives has noted several discrepancies about one of them, the so-called \"Cutler memo\" (Enclosures N and O). • 2) Another of the documents, the \"Project Aquarius\" message, has been discovered to be fake, in the sense that it has been altered by Bill Moore before being released to the public. As I write, there is no publicly available evidence that the original document Moore \"retyped\" was itself authentic. • 3) The primary source for orally- transmitted MJ-12 material, code-name \"Falcon,\" has been determined to be Richard C. Doty. According to Dr. Bruce Maccabee, Bill Moore has acknowledged that Doty confessed to forging the Ellsworth AFB document. Further, Doty's typewriter at Kirtland AFB OSI has been implicated in the \"Weitzel\" hoax, and he has provided information to Linda Howe that con- tradicts the \"facts\" contained in the Eisenhower briefing paper. • 4) The primary researcher involved in the MJ-12 affair, Bill Moore, has, by his own account, faked a govern- ment ID card and passed himself off as an intelligence operative to at least one individual for a period of over two years. Whether Moore showed Lee Graham a laminated MUFON card, as he now claims, or a genuine government badge of some type remains open to question. At the beginning of this letter, I asked whether the actions of those involved with the MJ-12 affair tended to suggest a genuine release of MUFON UFO Journal, No. 254, June 1989"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"8 Hay 1986 Freedom of Information Act Request (5 U.S.C. 55 2 ) Enclosure J Defense Investigative Service 1900 Half St. . S.W. Washington, D.C. 2032^-1700 Dear Sirs: This is a follow-up letter to my request (see enclosure A), which you responded to with reply (see enclosure B). When I received a cony of the document (see enclosure B2). I made a request to my se- curity office (see enclosure C) seeking to authenticate or repudiate the claims made in this document. I did this, becuase I do not have a Top Secret clearance and was, therefore, concerned if a breach of security may have been made. My security office made no request to me to surrender the document (see enclosure B2) making the assumption that it had been released and that I could share same with any- one. The document (see enclosure B2) had been given to me to (in turn) give a second copy (also Drovided by the source and as yet not reproduced by me) to researcher John Andrews for authenticating. Mr. John Andrews of the Tester Corporation is a fellow aircraft buff and expert on the histories of the development of the CIA/USAF Lockheed U-2 (see enclosure D), the CIA/ USAF Lockheed A-12/SR-71/D-21 aircraft (see enclosure E) and the alleged USAF/Lockheed F-19 stealth fighter which I have recently become most interested in (see enclosure F). Following the request of my security office to you (seeiletter C), to invetigate the document (see enclosure B2), my neighbors, my landlady, and my fellow emcloyees began telling me, that you (the Defense Investigative Service) had approached them asking various questions about me and HOST SPECIFICALLY about my interest in investigating the UFO phenomena, i. e. , in authenticating the document (see enclosure B2). It was this investigation (without yet informing me), that led me to make the request that I did (see enclosure A). Upon giving the copy (given to me) of the document (see enclosure B2) to John Andrews, I was informed by him, that this document had to have been released, and that it was the intention of its source (through me) to disseminate same among the members of the Aerospace community in whieh I work, and this I did as so indicated to me. Indeed, the source of the document (see enclosure B2) had indicated to me that he had been a re- proached by AFOSI for that very purpose, i. e., to disseminate information to the Public in order to convince them that the UFO phenomena was real and of extrater- restrial origin. Uron disseminating this document among my fellow employees, some individuals became concerned, resulting in the memo (see enclosure C). tf 4 t-  + - »+-? <>•*.? On the 19th of March 1986 I was interviewed by two agents (Aler4hBB*i«nd James Kirk) representing the Defense Investgative Service (see enclosure H). In the course of this interview, Mr. Kirk stated that this document (see enclosure B2) had been sanitized for release and that I was free to share same with anyone or make POIA requests as to its authenticity (see enclosure I) and the agency of ito origin. I asked if there were agencies within our Government who approach individuals (researchers) like myself for the excress purpose of \"leaking\" such documentation and was told... \"Yes, the Office of Air Force Investigations is one of them!\" I was asked who gave me the document (see enclosure B2) and I gave his name and address. I also reported to Mr. Kirk, that the individual who gave ne the document (see enclosure B2) had an identification card, Just like the one HE and Mr. Naval presented ne with, to identify themselves as being agents of the Defense Investigative Service. It is to be noted, that this individual HAS HOT been arrested, nor even interrogated for having this document (see enclosure B2). I MUST, therefore presume that this document is GENUINE and has been released! My security office has identified (to me) agents Alex Naval and James Kirk as being with the Defense Investigative Service. Having been told that this document (see enclosure B2) had been sanitized for release, I shared this information with the source (who nrovided me the cony of same) and he affirmed that the document HAD, indeed been released. Prior to having been given the sanitized copy of this oage (see enclosure B2) of this document, I was shown the same page, which had HP censoring at all! I MUST, therefore, presume that this document (see enclosure B2) in its entirety, has been declassified for release to the American nubile.

Howard Umv Dear Peter: To supplement Bruce Maccabee's letter of March 31 » which he showed us at an Exec Committee meeting this past Saturday, there are a few things you should know. (1) The AFOSI document is not authentic in the sense of not being an original; Moore has retyped it and done a cut and paste job, as he acknowledged in answer to my direct questioning when he attended our meeting three weeks ago. Larry Bryant spotted that it was not an appropriate typeface for AFOSI. (2) U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey was long ago absorbed into the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) — popularly known as \"Noah\"-- something- like 10 years ago. I personally checked this in the Government Manual. Most importantly, the change- over occurred many years before this AFOSI document was generated, which may or may not be significant. It is possible that the AFOSI person responding to someone's request fpr information was not aware of this and was referring- to outmoded file material. (3) And this is strictly between you and me, when Moore saw the document and request you had referred to us, he badmouthed you, the whole idea of FOIA requests, and every other UFO researcher except — of course — him and Stan Friedman. He stated that you had violated an agreement with him and compromised a source knowledgable about \"Project Aquarius\" that he had lined up. More and more (and Moore) I am seeing parallels between Moore and, your friend and mine, Todd Zechel, i.e., someone who wants all the action to himself and resents anyone else intruding on his territory. Bruce, apparently, is very taken by Moore , but others of us have our suspicions. I think Bruce lacks some perspective on all this, and I am trusting you to keep peace in the family by not confronting him about it. If you have any questions about this, my work number is (301) 65^-1550, 7:30-4:15 eve^r work day except Thursday when I work at home; home number (301) 779-8683.

I hope that those who are truly committed to finding the answer to this question will now renew their efforts. Hard questions must be put to Moore. Evasive answers and self-serving pronouncements from him should no longer be tolerated. I trust that those who have acted in good faith, including Jaime Shandera and Stanton Friedman, will be among his toughest questioners. Postscript In the above article I mistakenly referred to Lee Graham's security clearance as type \"Q\". Mr. Graham has asked that I include a clarification on this point. His status is actually that of an aerojet corporation clear- ance of some kind, and I regret the error. Mr. Graham also expressed the opinion that I \"misrepresented some of the things\" that he communicated to me. I have reviewed the portion of my article that deals with Mr. Graham's statements to me, and I consider my account of them to be fair and accu- rate. While I am certain that neither he nor I could reconstruct, word for word, our conversations after this lapse of time, I nevertheless stand by my portrayal of our talks. As I have already indicated, I con- sider Mr. Graham to be an honest and sincere individual. I accept the fact that his recollections of our communications may differ from mine on some points. The Pelley Time-Lapse UFO Encounter By Walter N. Webb Webb, a MUFON consultant in astronomy, is the author of the Journal's monthly \"Night Sky\" column. I received a letter on January 13, 1989, from an Arley Alabama, man who claimed to have suffered physi- cally and emotionally from a child- hood UFO encounter in Whiting, New Jersey. Daniel L. Pelley asked: \"Do you know of anyone, besides myself, who wants to get even with these beings? It's been 31 (30) years since my expe- rience but over the years my faith and trust in them slowly eroded to hate ... I want to take them out ... My experience has cost me dearly in terms of my health and emotions. But I do want to get even somehow.\" The only specifics Mr. Pelley men- tioned were a six-hour time lapse and a symbol that he recalled from his experience. But he offered more details if I were interested. (Later I learned that he had heard about me through his mother-in-law's \"science magazine.\" It was an article on UFO abduction cases. The story may have been the one in the Janua- ry/February 1989 Body, Mind & Spirit — \"New Evidence for UFO's.\") Mr. Pelley's initial letter prompted an exchange of correspondence about his experience over the next few months in which the witness filled out MUFON forms and kindly answered MUFON UFO Journal, No. 254, June 1989 my many questions. What follows is a tentative report on his 1959 encoun- ter, using his verbatim comments whenever possible. Daniel Pelley is 37 years old, mar- ried and disabled with three crushed discs in his lower back, the result of a fall at work (he was a printer) and an earlier injury received in an automo- bile accident. His Social Security dis- ability was granted in 1986. At pres- ent both he and his wife are unemployed. I furnished the witness with the name of the Alabama MUFON State Director, Scott A. Caldwell of Hunts- ville. Dan wished to continue the inquiry into his experience through a local investigator. The Encounter The time frame of the UFO episode was determined with the help of Daniel's mother. She said the year was 1959 (not 1958) and the sighting occurred around mid-June, the approx- imate interval since the school year ended. He was eight years old and liv- ing in the rural Whiting area of cen- tral New Jersey near the vast military complex of McGuire Air Force Base, Fort Dix, and the Lakehurst Naval Air Station. His father, in fact, was \"a Chief Master Sergeant and a weapons specialist in ground-to-air and air-to- air weapons\" at McGuire. In Mr. Pelley's initial narrative below, bracketed comments are occasionally inserted. These represent either my own remarks or further clarifications by the witness which I have paraph- rased or quoted directly. Dan described what happened on that sunny, warm day in June 1959: \"My family and I had recently moved off base (McGuire Air Force Base) to a rural setting out in the country. 1 had grown accustomed to aircraft and dirigibles from the Naval Air Station and had seen many fly overhead. However, one day my mother packed me a sandwich and drink as I pre- pared to go on one of my usual hiking trips out into the woods. It was about 11:30 when I left the house and headed deep into the pine forest. \"Around noon I came out of the dense pines into a clearing that was a perfect circle. (He estimated that the site was approximately one-quarter of a mile from his house. The clearing appeared to be about 60 feet in diameter and grassy with very small plants within. Nothing unusual about the grass, or whether the ground had been disturbed in any way, could be recalled. The surrounding forest \"was very dense around the circle, the average size of the trees I would estimate at 35 to 40 feet.\") I walked to the center and sat down. The sun felt warm and I decided to eat my lunch there. \"As I ate, I noticed the trees around the circle had been scraped and the bark gone or hanging. Also limbs had been broken. A couple of 11"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"trees were leaning outward as if they had been pushed over. (The bent trees were scattered around the peri- meter of the clearing. They were smaller than the forest trees, \"six-inch diameter and perhaps 20 feet tall.\" All damage to the trees occurred on the side facing the clearing, and the bark was scraped off at about the 10-to-15- foot level above the ground.) \"My first thought was there was a bear around that had done this. I grew apprehensive and hurried to fin- ish my lunch. Then as I stood up a giant shadow fell upon me. The entire circle was darkened and several feet out into the wooded area was also dark. I noticed beyond the shadow the trees were still sunlit and bright. \"I looked up and saw a grayish cir- cular object perhaps 300 feet over- head. My first thought was a Navy blimp was overhead but I heard no motors and except for a humming sound, similar to a very high pitch electrical motor but not very loud, was all I heard. \"My first thought of the object after that was a garbage can lid. I was amused but a little frightened. My instinct said run but my legs wouldn't move. (When queried about his immo- bility, Dan said: \"I can't say for sure [the] exact reasons but [am] inclined to believe it was fear.\") I felt para- lyzed and then watched as the object came down to about 100 feet over- head. I could see the finer detail of the craft (bottom side only) and then felt like I was full of electricity. I could even see the sparks in my eyes and then nothing. (The witness's sketch depicts the underside of a metallic disc with a dark gray \"vented or ribbed\" outer ring about three feet wide. This ring \"was lined with raised and lower(ed) sections approximately six inches wide interconnected as high-low-high-low, etc.\" Inside the ring was a larger recessed darker area, and in the cen- ter a smaller circle bisected by a dou- ble wave or S-shaped line. Dan believes this was \"a door or opening.\" He recalls no rotation or internal motion associated with the object. The UFO appeared to be larger than a house and about the same diameter as the clearing — 60 feet. Indeed, Dan feels that the clearing was pro- 12 duced by the UFO. \"Being both the same size,\" he explains, \"I am inclined to believe so and since no trees, even smaller ones, were in the circle, something kept them from growing there. It's as though they had used the same site over, repeatedly, for a lengthy amount of time.\") \"The next thing I became aware of I was back at the edge of the woods near my house and I heard my mother calling me home. It was about 6:00 p.m. and I had missed supper. She was angry and worried that I had become lost. I tried to tell her and Dad about the round blimp in the woods but they laughed it off.\" (Although he believes he consciously observed the UFO for about a min- ute, Dan implies an ensuing time lapse of around six hours! His only recollection during this interval of missing time is a rectilinear symbol (on what he believes was a, door) which I compared with a sheet of symbols reported by other UFO abductees. A few were similar but not close enough to match. These sym- bols are being kept confidential by a limited number of abduction investiga- tors in case duplicates turn up in other episodes.) Subsequent Events The witness reported a number of long-term physiological aftereffects and other events which he believes are linked with his UFO experience. The sorts of symptoms/phenomena cited by Dan Pelley frequently are des- cribed by percipients following UFO close encounters (of all kinds), espe- cially CE-IVs. Pelley recounted these postencoun- ter occurrences in chronological order: \"A month later I saw a ghost or what I thought was a ghost in my room. I never forgot the face. It was looking at me, very close, examining me. It had large eyes and pale skin but it didn't appear alien or what you see on television. It was more human looking than a monster. It still scared me silly and I got up and ran into a wall. I told my parents a man was in my room and he was going to kidnap me. Of course it was only a bad dream, or so they said. (It is difficult to say whether the 8- year-old experienced a dream recall of a suppressed UFO abduction, a true apparition, or a hypnagogic or hypnopompic hallucination. All have been reported at various times in the wake of UFO encounters — pheno- mena perhaps triggered by the buried or repressed memories, with their associated stress, surrounding the initial episode.) \"Three months after the incident I broke out in a very severe case of psoriasis. It has persisted to this day. \"One year later (age 9) my eyesight grew bad. No one in my family has or had eye problems. No glasses or pso- riasis. One optometrist told me my eyes had been burned by a bright light, like watching a solar eclipse. (The witness explains further: \"My eyesight is 140 in my left and 160 in my right. I wear glasses but the con- dition has not worsened since 1960. I was told by a doctor on base that my eyes had been burned and scar tissue had caused the eyes to become ellip- tical rather than round. I have no solid evidence to attribute my eyes and skin problems to the UFO but seeing as both of these problems came about shortly after my encoun- ter, I'm inclined to believe so.\") (Similar sentiments are echoed by Kathy Kasten in a recent issue of UFO. 1 She states: \"I know that medi- cal conditions I've had —dissimilar to anything in my family's medical his- tory — are connected to my contact experiences. At age nine, I contracted a condition called 'mastoids' and pso- riasis. The rash appeared first on my upper chest, then on the upper inside thighs and the right leg ...\" For addi- tional information on UFO afteref- fects, see Bullard. 2 ) Dan continued: \"In my teen years I became aware of ESP abilities and an increasing desire to learn everything about science and history. I felt like a computer, storing knowledge for some later date. (Bullard comments: \"Witnesses whose ESP ability blossoms after an abduction represent just one possibil- ity for change, while some individuals alter in broader aspects of their per- sonalities and lifestyles ... The com- monest way abductees improve is by developing a hunger for knowledge, usually in subjects without previous attraction and often in difficult or eso- MUFON UFO Journal, No. 254, June 1989"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"teric fields like physics and philosophy or occult and spiritual matters ...\" 3 ) \"1 would often go out at night and gaze at the stars and wondered when they would come and get me and take me home. I felt alien ... (In) 1969, (at) age 18, (I became) convinced I was abducted. \"As the years passed I continued my studies, astronomy, physics, biology, ESP, etc., but my feelings for them grew distant. I lost interest in them and gradually it turned to contempt. They never came back and I was left here. However, I still feel that one day they will come back for me and now I want to punish them for putting me through what I've experienced. \"I will add, however, that the encoun- ter possibly boosted my ESP and my understanding of the sciences and the construction of, I believe, of even the universe. Pretty good boast from a nobody, but I have many names and dates to back what I say. Still, this is lit- tle consolation for the physical suffering and the emotional trauma I was put through. So basically you could say I hate their guts!\" UFO abductees often report subse- quent sightings or abductions. Bullard finds such additional sightings the most common postabduction aftereffect of all.\" Dan said he had seen \"four other unknowns.\" He briefly summarized them as follows: • May 1971, Highway 17/92, several miles south of De Land, Florida, at about 7:30 a.m. a round ball, metallic, reflecting the morning sun, hovering 50 feet over the road, approximately 80 feet across, observed % mile away, remained for several seconds, then shot straight up at incredible speed, and disappeared. • February 1973, Northglenn, Colo- rado, 11 p.m., from east to west a ball of light, same size as a bright star, zig- zagged at a very high rate of speed. Too fast for any plane and angles too sharp. Sister also observed. • August 1977. As above but location was Brighton, Colorado, and object moved from west to east. Time 9:00 p.m. Sister and ex-wife observed too. • June 1978. Brighton, Colorado. 4 p.m., cigar-shaped, very large, at high altitude, brought to attention by daugh- ter who told me of an airplane in the sky that had no wings. Moved from MUFON UFO Journal, No. 254, June 1989 south to north very slow. Evaluation Until now, Dan Pelley says that only his wife and parents were told of his 1959 experience. He has never returned to the site and doubts that he could find it again. It is impossible to evaluate the 1959 report fully for a number of reasons — the 30-year elapsed time since the encounter, my inability to visit both the actual site in New Jersey and the wit- ness in Alabama, and the lack of sup- porting witnesses. Therefore, no back- ground character checks were made nor psychological tests administered to the witness. Mr. Pelley has not yet attempted hypnotic regression in order to explore his six-hour time lapse. \"I will admit,\" he says, \"the thought of being regressed in hypnosis back to that experience is frightening. Perhaps I will find the cour- age to try one day.\" Besides possibly uncovering details of an abduction scenario, hypnosis might prove beneficial in relieving some of the anxiety and stress undoubtedly con- nected with the experience. It is possi- ble that at least some of the witness's health problems might have underlying psychosomatic causes associated with the 30-year-old incident. Dan Pelley demonstrates some clas- sic postabduction aftereffects — a time lapse, dream recall/apparition/bedroom hallucination, physiological and psycho- somatic ailments, psychic sensitivity, increased learning, and further UFO sightings. This type of UFO encounter, involv- ing a child witness and a UFO descent in an isolated wooded site followed by a memory/time lapse, is very similar to other cases which I am aware of. Such reports are not at all uncommon. I checked my files for other UFO sightings in New Jersey during the summer of 1959. Although no other reports turned up, a UFO wave was in progress in areas ranging from the Pacific to the Americas. Australia, New Zealand, New Guinea, South America, and the U.S. all reported many close- encounter events involving low-level hovering, landings, and physical traces. Two sample physical-trace cases from the U.S.: • In July 1959 a Jane Lew, West Vir- ginia, couple were awakened by barking dogs and heard a high-pitched sound growing louder until it seemed over their house. Both individuals became paralyzed. The husband managed to crawl to the window and saw a glow outside. At the approach of a truck, the strange noise suddenly decreased rapidly and faded away. Next morning he dis- covered a 25-foot oval area where the grass had withered. 5 • On September 7, 1959, a Walling- ford, Kentucky, rural postal carrier observed a 30-to-40-foot, bluish-gray, glowing, oval object hovering above trees beyond his house about 2:30 a.m. Almost immediately, the object rose with a burst of flame to about 500 feet then shot away horizontally to the east. A black smoke ring was left in the air above the trees. Six days later the wit- ness and neighbors found a 12-to-13- foot diameter ring of burned grass in a field at the spot where the UFO had hovered. 6 In conclusion, about all that can be said is that the Pelley encounter paral- lels many of the elements reported in other CE-IVs. Taking into account the limited investigation, which did not include a face-to-face interview or visit to the site, and other factors (no supporting witnesses, age of the wit- ness at the time of the sighting, the 30-year age of the sighting itself), I believe the 1959 episode should be classified as a tentative unknown. I also give it a Paranet/Hynek Strange- ness/Probability Rating of S5/P3 (High- ly strange, suggesting intelligent gui- dance/somewhat credible or indetermi- nate).

On December 12, 1987, fiery objects streaked over the central United States, observed by thousands of people over a 14 state area. Accord- ing to North American Aerospace Defense Command, the display was caused by an orbiting Soviet rocket casing which had re-entered Earths atmosphere. In a corridor running northwest to southeast from Montana to Florida, the glowing objects were seen by airliner crews at altitudes exceeding 30,000 feet. Most observers reporting to the National UFO Report- ing Center estimated, the altitude of the objects to be quite high. During the same time frame of the reported high altitude sightings, however, sev- eral witnesses reported close encoun- ter experiences and very low altitude flights of wingless vehicles. If the des- criptions given by these witnesses are accurate, then I think it would be safe to assume that several large UFOs accompanied the burning space debris as it entered our atmosphere. As the fiery objects passed over- head at approximately 8:50 PM (CST), objects moving at very low altitude were first reported by witnesses locat- ed five miles west of Eudora, Kansas. Two \"huge\" oblong objects — each surrounded by a haze of light — passed directly overhead, traveling southeast into the state of Missouri. Lights or lighted openings extended the full length of the objects and they were visible for about three minutes, moving very slowly. Shortly thereafter a 34-year-old male witness living on the shore of the Lake of the Ozarks, Missouri (near the city of Climax Springs), had just loaded his fireplace with wood and walked out the first floor of his house to get more fire- wood. Ten other members of his fam- ily were on the second floor. He was standing in the driveway, 14 looking out across the lake, when something told him to turn around. As he turned he looked up into the sky, just as a cloud of mist came over the tops of the trees. The mist was so thick it engulfed the top limbs of the trees. When the \"cloud\" reached a point almost overhead he could see three oblong objects as big as jet air- liners about 300 feet off the ground. Suddenly the objects stopped. The man could hear no sound, but as the cloud of mist thinned he could see a row of lighted openings extending along the length of the three objects. Describing his experience, the wit- ness, who I shall refer to as J.E., said: \"They were shrouded inside a mist, and my body wasn't able to move. I was not able to move. My body could not move. I wanted to scream for my girl friend, my sister-in-law, my mother, my brother, and the seven children who were in the house, to come look, too. I tried to scream. The object stood there and hovered about 300 feet from me. I'm talking about three craft the size of a large jet airliner at a minimum. No wings or tails. Cigar- shape, in formation side by side. When the craft ceased to move the cloud began to thin. As the cloud thinned I could see lights: I could see the shape of the craft. They appeared to be a dark green. They each had at least 30 windows at a minimum, iden- tical to the rows of windows on an airliner. I saw faces looking out the windows at me, pointing at me with their fingers. They stood there and looked at me and cocked their heads and pointed like I was an exhibition in a zoo. \"The light from inside the craft was so bright, shining out the windows, that I could tell ... their heads were human-shaped. I could tell there were eyes in the heads; I could tell that the eyes were large. There were no visual appearances of hair or ears from what I could see. They definitely had a human-shaped body. When the objects stopped over me, the closest one to me raised up so that the next one could lower down, in stairstep fashion, then the third one lowered down, so that the people, creatures, or whatever, could see me plainly. They stared at me like I was a zebra in a zoo, like a lion in a cage, an insect in a jar. They were undoubt- edly carrying on a conversation because of the way the heads were pointing and looking at each other. I could tell these 'things' were talking about the fact that I was standing down there on the ground. \"The minute, and I mean the very instant those craft started to move away my body started to move and that's when I started screaming. 'God, everybody, come out here right now,' and I'm screaming like a mad man, 'Come out and see this right now.' I was so hysterical. Everybody ran out immediately and they all saw them, too. I had no idea how long I was out in the driveway. I estimated 10 or 15 minutes.\" As the three objects moved out over the lake and disappeared from view, J.E. and his brother drove to the top of a nearby hill hoping to see the craft again. The brother became frightened and returned to the house. J.E. explains what happened after his brother left: \"I'm standing on top of my truck with my binoculars look- ing for them to come back. People were passing and saying, 'You saw it, too.' I said, 'Yes, I saw it, too.' An elderly couple, who live on the lake with me, saw the craft cross Highway 7 near Climax Springs. They pulled their truck off the road and got out, each holding a camera. They told me they were unable to remove the lens caps off their cameras.\" Cigar Shapes According to J.E. all three of the MUFON UFO Journal, No. 254, June 1989"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"\\ craft were cigar-shaped. On the back they had pods that resembled jet engine pods on the back of a 727 air- liner, except that they had a green glob of light that was mounted to the top of these pods. Out of the back of the pods were lights that were identi- cal to the headlights of a car in a fog. \"They were shrouded in a cloud of mist,\" J.E. said. \"They stopped so close to me that 1 could see no seams, no rivets, no plates. The skin of these vehicles was totally smooth, with a flat texture. The third one was virtually touching the tops of the trees (when it lowered itself). I was so scared ... I have never in my life experienced anything like this. My whole attitude just got a whole re- arrangement, because I know I'm not nuts. I was stone sober and I don't do drugs. I know what I saw.\" J.E. is a corporate salesman and is highly respected in his community. At about 9:03 PM and 70 miles nor- theast of Climax Springs, two adults, in seperate vehicles, were driving west on Highway 50, 10 miles east of Lynn, Missouri. In the distance they observed a pair of \"big\" white lights moving about 50 to 100 MPH at very low altitude. As the lights got closer, the two witnesses could see that they were part of an oblong vehicle of some kind. Mr. T.H., 34, gave the following description of what he saw: \"It was moving slow and was never more than 100 feet off the ground. It crossed Highway 50 and was about 200 feet from the roadway on the south side. Suddenly it stopped, and we watched the thing hover about 100 feet off the ground. Then it lowered itself real easy into the woods. We stopped and watched it for a little while but decided not to walk over and look at it. There was no sound. We decided it was time to get back into the car and go on about our business. A man in a white pickup truck had also stopped and he was still there as we were leaving.\" T.H. estimated the object to be as long as two large military helicopters put together lengthwise. Other less spectacular reports of low level flights were received from Missouri that night. Two adult wit- nesses in St. Louis reported seeing three \"missile-shaped\" objects with a surface like stainless steel move across the sky. In Chesterfield, a suburb of St. Louis, Mr. T.B. reported that he and several friends watched three oblong objects in the sky for five to six minutes. They looked like \"slender Goodyear blimps.\" Shortly after the reported landing near Lynn, another close encounter occurred about 200 miles to the north in Iowa. Mr. M.L., 24, who has a farm at Oskaloosa, was out in a field just west of his house riding a three- wheeler at 9:15 PM, when an object with lights came over the top of the trees and stopped right over him. At that point the lights on the object went out. \"I was at a dead stop,\" M.L. said. \"I shined my wheat light up into the air, about 50 to 60 feet, and the beam from the light hit Calendar of UFO Conferences for 1989 June 29 & 30, July 1 — 10th Rocky Mountain Conference on UFO Investigation, Uni- versity of Wyoming, Laramie, Wyoming.

It was shiny and reflected off the bottom of it. It was like stainless steel of some kind. It was just a big shiny object, at least 80 to 100 feet long and 40 to 60 feet wide. I didn't hear any motor noise at all. It sat there for a minute then it took off to the southeast of my place. \"When it took off it didn't have any lights on. Then when it got off quite a ways the lights came on. There were three lights down one side of it and it had bright streaks shooting out the back end of it.\" M.L. raced back to his house hop- ing that his wife would be able to see it. When he arrived his young son and his wife were standing outside. They had seen the lights as they went by the house. \"The next day some friends were telling me that they had seen in the papers that the object was a Soviet satellite that was supposed to be on fire,\" M.T. explained. \"Wha- tever this was it was not on fire.

In 1949 the success of Communism in China raised the frightening pros- pect of a hostile Sino-Soviet military colossus, and when the Russians exploded their own A-bomb in August that year it meant that America could no longer even count on a technolog- ical advantage. To meet the challenge many super- secret deliberations were convened, and one of the first decisions was the Air Force Science Advisory Board authorizing the \"Air Defense Systems Engineering Committee\" to be headed by Air Force scientist Dr. George Valley. However, as many new committees and projects came under considera- tion, a serious difficulty arose. This difficulty had to do with policy. The policy problem originated with the brilliant Dr. Robert Openheimer who was chairman of the important General Advisory Committee which made him the top man in America's nuclear weapon development and research program. Oppenheimer either served on, or acted as a consultant to, every committee and project of consequence. The first hint of trouble was when Air Force Chief of Staff General Hoyt Vandenberg snubbed Oppenheimer by selecting Dr. Vannevar Bush to study the evidence of the Russian detonation. Moreover, when scientists Ivan Gettigh and Louis Ridenour sug- gested a special strategic nuclear weapon study, General Vandenberg and Air Force Secretary Thomas Finletter issued direct orders to bar Oppenheimer from any role and also to forbid the GAC chief access to classified Air Force documents. These examples of animosity were due to Oppenheimer's attitude toward some- thing the Air Force High Command wanted very badly. 16 By Lor en Gross Super Bomb When Russia became a nuclear power, some American physicists sug- gested that America could regain mil- itary supremacy by building a hydro- gen bomb. Theoretical work on a super-bomb had been conducted in a leisurely fashion since the end of World War II and although little had been done it was felt the principle was feasible. Shortly after learning of the Russian nuclear test, President Truman phoned Oppenheimer to ask what he believed should be the appropriate response. Oppenheimer merely replied: \"Keep your shirt on.\" When Dr. Edward Teller was told about Oppenheimer's air of uncon- cern, he was outraged and imme- diately launched a personal campaign to win support for a high priority H- bomb project. A passionate anti- Communist, Teller's view was that America had to deal with Russia from a position of superiority — not parity. Other influential persons rallied to Teller like Dr. Luis Alvarez and Dr. David Griggs, as did General Jimmy Doolittle, retired but still a high level consultant to the Air Force. The Air Force High Command agreed totally with these men. The dominant Air Force view, strongly held by men like Generals Vandenberg and Le May, and Secretary Finletter, was that all resources should be reserved for strategic bombardment and if a big bomb could be built, the bigger the bomb the better. Oppenheimer opposed the \"super\" on two grounds, one ethical and one practical. His ethical reason was that the proposed H-bomb would be so incredibly destructive it would far exceed any rational military justifica- tion, so its use would be immoral. His practical reason was that it would be simple and cheap just to boost the power of conventional fission bombs to a 500 kiloton size which would be adequate for strategic purposes and thereby permit much of the nation's limited resources to be allocated to a tactical defense of Western Europe and to the development of an air defense network for North America. This would also allow all three military services to take part in the nuclear weapon program. With the foregoing in mind, one can understand why Oppenheimer and those who shared his ideas were not very popular people with the Air Force's strategic theorists. (Oppen- heimer also did not endear himself to the Air Force by his opposition to the nuclear-powered bomber project which was finally cancelled as being a tech- nological flop in 1960 after a billion dollars had been wasted.) Because it appeared America had demobilized too quickly after World War II in view of the international situation, President Truman requested a review and an assessment of the nation's military and foreign policies, which in large part included discus- sions about Russia becoming a nuclear power and the proposal to develop the hydrogen weapon. Five months later, while such studies were being carried out, the Korean War started which gave tremendous impetus to hawks like Teller who felt sterner measures were needed, for apparently the Communists were choosing a \"hot\" war in spite of America's fission bomb arsenal. Foo Fighters Late in 1950 a \"Long Range Objec- tive Panel\" was appointed to study military tactics, strategy, and the rela- tionship of nuclear weapons to foreign policy. Oppenheimer managed to chair this group but he was balanced by the selection of two pro-Teller people, Dr. Alvarez and Dr. Griggs. Dr. Alvarez had a strong bond to the MUFON UFO Journal, No. 254, June 1989"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"strategic bombing generals. During the Second World War he did work on the Manhattan project at Los Alamos and also found time to invent his \"Long Eagle\" bombing radar at M.I.T.'s Radiation Laboratory. Dr. Griggs had strong ties too, helping establish the RAND Corporation in 1947 in order to bring systematic and analytical thinking to bear on Air Force tactics and strategy, and during the latter months of World War II headed a special investigation, with Dr. Alvarez and Dr. H. P. Robertson, into a strange phenomenon annoying Air Force air strikes on Germany and Japan, a phenomenon dubbed the \"foo fighters.\" The expression \"foo fighter\" brings up the subject of UFOs. Many of the names in this essay show up in UFO literature for good reason. Back in 1949 when Dr. George Valley of M.I.T. was concerned with Air Defense Systems, he authored a summation of project SIGN (con- ducted by Dr. James B. Conant who shared Dr. Oppenheimer's position on the H-bomb). This project had col- lected data on reports of unidentified aerial intruders in America's airspace, the so-called \"flying saucers.\" SIGN was surprisingly inconclusive in regards to a possible novel Russian aircraft, and even entertained, believe it or not, an extraterrestrial solution. The aerial mystery received inten- sive official scrutiny when the \"green fireballs\" appeared over highly sensi- tive atomic installations in New Mex- ico during the Winter of 1948-49. Dr. Joseph Kaplan of the U.S. Air Force Scientific Advisory Board took charge of a special inquiry beginning on Feb- ruary 16, 1949. He pondered the mys- tery for months, trying all the time to get more data; meanwhile Russia exploded its bomb. General C.P. Cabell of AFOIN, Washington, D.C. who had requested Dr. Kaplan to investigate the \"fireballs,\" wanted answers, but Kaplan put him off and asked to confer with Dr. Teller and Dr. George Gamow (another pro- strategic bombing advocate). Events are murky but the fireball problem was shunted aside by calling it a pos- sible geomagnetic phenomenon, and the flying saucer project, GRUDGE, was killed off almost immediately after MUFON UFO Journal, No. 254, June 1989 General Vandenberg's air sampling aircraft detected traces of the Russian nuclear explosion. UFO reports were still being forwarded to Wright Field, but they were not being investigated or verified. General Cabell was evi- dently kept in the dark about this until the Ft. Monmouth incident of September 20, .1951 when he person- ally took an interest in the New Jer- sey case in order to assist a Mr. Johnson and a Mr. Brewster of Republic Aviation who were standing in for a \"group of top U.S. Industrial- ists and scientists\" which was, evi- dently, a \"project LINCOLN.\" Much is still highly classified and therefore not available to elucidate us, but it is evident that the flying saucer question in 1949-52 had some effect on the intense, top secret, debates about whether or not to launch a major acceleration of the arms race. What we do know is that the \"Long Range Objective Panel\" did authorize a narrowly focused effort, which was to analyze proposed means to develop an air defense network for the continental United States called project LINCOLN. While we do not know who voted for LINCOLN on the LROP, or how they felt about it, it's possible it was Oppenheimer's idea. Dr. Griggs became alarmed in 1951 when he heard rumors that prospec- tive members of project LINCOLN were being told that for the sake of world peace the Air Defense Com- mand should be strengthened and the Strategic Air Command sacrificed, done away with to demonstrate the lack of aggressive intentions of the United States. Dr. Griggs blamed this on what he called the \"ZORC cabal,\" a group composed of Drs. Zacharias, Oppenheimer, Rabi, and C.C. Laurit- sen, which was suppositively engaged in \"nefarious anti-Air Force schemes.\" The climax of the \"Teller-Oppenheim- er\" battle was reached in March 1953 when the newly elected president, Dwight Eisenhower, was forced to make a decision whether to approve a big expansion of the Air Defense Command which the Air Force top brass feared would be done at the expense of the Strategic Air Command. It should be clear to the reader at this point that the Air Force had a very good reason to be anti-UFO besides the ones usually assigned that service branch by students of the aerial phenomenon. Apparently the stubborn ability of the UFOs to remain unexplained gave aid and comfort to the Oppenheimer crowd. The timing of the \"Robertson Panel\" may not have been accidental, con- vened as it was just before Eisenhow- er's decision.

The media and people in general tend to reject extremes and seek to form a middle-ground consensus. We reject the extreme of Strieber's asser- tion that these adventures \"really\" happened, but we also reject the other extreme which suggests that Strieber is consciously making the whole thing up to sell books, merely an extension of his earlier horror fic- tion writing. One effect of Communion's impact in the general market is that UFO writing is no longer confined to the believe-everything UFO magazines at one extreme and the disbelieve-every- thing debunkers at the other. We now find \"abductions\" in a major \"mainstream\" magazine such as Psy- cho/ogy Today. And that magazine sees the phenomenon from a consen- sus-seeking middle position as arising from \"the dark interior world of the human psyche.\" One even gets the impression that Strieber himself suspects something of the sort, as if there were thoughts and ideas in some remote part of his brain that he is unable to acknowl- edge. Particularly so in his latest book, Transformation, where he says the \"visitors\" who \"abducted\" him \"took me on a fabulous and terrible journey through my fears ... They 18 By Robert Wanderer also compelled me to face my guilts, my rages, my sorrows, all that I have burried in myself (p. 11). Superficially, the new book may seem to be little more than an exten- sion of the previous one. In Commun- ion we were given incident after inci- dent which left us questioning Strieber's memory, his ability to distinguish real- ity from imagination, and his overall credibility. For example, he said in Communion that he had claimed for years that he had been present at the University of Texas during Charles Whitman's shooting spree from the tower in 1966, but now admitted \"I wasn't there\" (p. 121). In the new book he reports he conducted \"an extensive investigation\" and decided that he must have been there after all because a friend confirmed he was standing where Strieber now \"remem- bers\" seeing him (p.93). We find other suggestive points all through the book. He declares \"my childhood was full of alien-abduction fears\" (p. 107). He concludes that his earlier writings of horror fiction reflect- ed an \"attempt to cope with an enormous, hidden, and frightful real- ity\" (p.125). Perhaps most exotic of all is his concern that the Chernobyl nuclear disaster in Russia indicated \"that the moon was going to explode\" (p.65). But there's more here than this parade of strange incidents. I confess I was deeply touched by his decision to confront his fears by taking a walk in the dark woods around his house late at night. In Chapter 11 he repeatedly tries to go on that walk, but gives up in fear very time. Finally in chapter 15 he succeeds, and I admired how he overcame his deep fears. How can we reconcile the power of his walk in the woods with the book's seeming lack of credibility? I wrote Dr. Donald Klein, Strieber's psychia- trist who was quoted extensively in the first book and to some degree in this one. Are Strieber's experiences \"true\"? \"I did not ever believe that Mr. Strieber's experiences were objectively true,\" Dr. Klein replied, \"but that he was suffering from some very atypical state of mind and, as I indicated (in Communion), perhaps temporal lobe epilepsy might account for this.\" Dr. Klein added that while the tests for temporal lobe epilepsy on Strieber were \"negative,\" the tests available for that condition are \"rather poor\" and therefore apparently not as signif- icant as Strieber believes. For me, Dr. Klein's answer trans- formed Transformation. What had been an unsettling mishmash of hard- to-accept material on how Strieber thinks and acts, now made sense. Understandably, Strieber does not — in fact, probably cannot — conclude that some anomaly in his brain has such an effect on him. I now see Transformation as the saga of a man who sincerely believes that \"visitors\" have \"abducted\" him, but nevertheless achieves a tremend- ous affirmation of himself by defying his tormentors and walking in the dark of the woods. I see the trans- formed Transformation as a powerful description of the inner life of a troubled man, as pioneering in its way as The Invisible Man was for reveal- ing the life of a black man in segrega- tion, or The Three Faces of Eve was for showing the life of a multiple per- sonality. Even though I believe the possibility that \"abductions\" are objec- tively real is extremely remote, I now find Strieber a sympathetic, even heroic, figure.

(Some lessons from the ninth century abductions in France).\" Since these early accounts of \"cloud-ships\" from another realm featured prominently (and controversially) in the author's Passport To Magonia, Vallee has taken the opportunity to cite the orig- inal Latin source, St. Agobard's De Grandine et Tonitruis (\"About Hail and Thunder\"), a rational polemic which sought to defuse popular pea- sant myths and superstitions regard- ing the weather and \"tempestaires,\" who were a sort of meteorological sorcerer, or middleman between events above and below. Three men and a woman who were said to have fallen from one of these cloud-ships were brought before the archbishop by a pelt-hungry mob who would have probably stoned them to death but for Abogard's intervention. Here, alas, history haunts and taunts us with one of her typical fail- ures to provide a complete account of events. Were the four would-be vic- tims among the first known abduc- tees, or were they perhaps \"collabor- ators,\" or simply victims of mistaken identity or folklore? As far as the analogy holds, little has changed for those in chains but the threat of being stoned to death. Even so, the incident leads Vallee to propose the skeptical Abogard as the patron saint of abduc- tees for having saved their lives.

It was at a high altitude. Observers over an 800-mile stretch from Key West, Flor- ida to St. Simon's Island, Georgia, reported the fiery ball. The flaming object took between five to 10 min- utes to cross the sky, moving in a horizontal flight path. Ten members of an Air Force detachment that wit- nessed the passage said: \"after the object reached its zenith it slowly began a graduated auger-shaped ('Z'- shaped) descent.\" The Air Force investigating officer who filed the offi- cial report with Project GRUDGE, remarked: \"It is the opinion of this officer that this object was not a meteor due to its erratic course.\" This opinion was not conveyed to the news media which, in their stories on the incident, suggested that a meteor was responsible. *** THIRTY FIVE YEARS AGO - June 1954: Gary J. Vargo was work- ing in his yard in Utica, Michigan (date unknown), when he heard a B- 29 bomber going overhead. As he watched the aircraft he spotted a V- formation of ten silvery, disc-shaped craft following it. The discs then completely circled the bomber, chang- ing position in formation. At one point several of the discs sped westward in the direction of two Piper Cub air- craft, then returned to the B-29. Mr. Vargo and his mother watched the discs for about 20 minutes as the veh- icles maneuvered in formation, reflect- ing sunlight. On the eighth, Lt. Col. John O'Mara, Deputy Commander of Intel- ligence, Wright Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio, stated: \"An average of 20 700 UFO sightings are reported to the Air Force each week; Over 1000 of the nations leading scientist are working on governmental UFO pro- jects; Dr. Clyde Tombaugh and Dr. Lincoln LaPaz are heading a project in White Sands, New Mexico, where scientists are tracking two artificial satellites circling our planet.\" Lt. Harry B. Roe, Jr., an Ohio National Guard pilot, had a UFO encounter between Columbus and Dayton, Ohio on the 23rd. He pursued a bright object but it evaded his air- craft. Then he reported to the tower controller at Vandalia airport: \"I'm being chased by a white light. I'll cir- cle the tower so you can see it.\" As the F-51 flew over the airport, Traffic Controller George Barnes focused his binoculars on the brilliant object but the glow hid the shape behind it. Dropping his flaps, Lt. Roe \"chopped\" his throttle to slow down quickly. But the strange object matched every move, with perfect precision. Then as Barnes watched from the tower, the glowing object abruptly abandoned the chase. In a sharp turn it passed the F-51 and swiftly vanished toward the southwest. Just after sunset on the 29th, near Seven Islands, Quebec, Canada, a BOAC Stratocruiser — bound from New York to London with 51 pas- sengers — was followed for 18 min- utes (about 80 miles of airpath) by one large vehicle and six smaller craft that flew curious \"formations\" about it. The pilot of the Stratocruiser was Capt. James Howard, a highly respect- ed BOAC flight officer. About 20 wit- nesses, including both passengers and crew, gave statements as to the unprecedented nature of the objects. All of the objects were dark and the smaller craft formed geometric forma- tions as they shifted positions from time to time. Just before an F-86 interceptor arrived from Goose Air Force Base at Howard's request, First Officer Boyd and Navigator George Allen said the small craft seemed to merge into the larger vehicle. Then the large vehicle moved out of sight in a matter of seconds to the northwest. *** THIRTY YEARS AGO - June 1959: Structured wingless vehicles, bathed in a shaft of blue light and carrying \"illuminated occupants\" were observed near the Boianai Anglican Mission at Papua, New Guinea on the 26th and 27th. Witnesses included Father William Booth \"Bill\" Gill who wrote a very lengthy, detailed report of UFO activity over areas inland from Port Moresby. At 6:45 p.m. on the 26th, 38 persons gathered to watch a large disc-shaped craft with four legs hover overhead. On top of the vehicle four humanlike figures, their bodies surrounded by some kind of illumination, seemed to be \"doing something on deck.\" At various times one or all of the figures would disap- pear below, only to reappear soon after. At 7:30 p.m. the craft was lost from view. At 6 p.m. the next day the craft and their occupants returned. Again the beings appeared to be working on something. This time Gi)l and a dozen other witnesses waved and shouted to the occupants. They waved back. By 7:45 p.m. the vehicle had left the area. An Australian UFO organization investigated the Boianai activity and concluded that, \"The Boianai sightings do not prove ipso facto that the UFOs are non-terrestrial spaceships; they indicate a strong likelihood that they are such.\" *** TWENTY FIVE YEARS AGO — JUNE 1964: Charles Englebrecht, 18, was watching television in his home in Dale, Indiana, at 8:55 P.M. on the 14th when he saw a light pass by the kitchen window. As he went to inves- tigate, the television set and house lights went out. Outside, the witness saw an orange object as large as a basketball resting on the ground in the back yard. As he attempted a closer approach, Englebrecht said he felt something pressing him back; he froze in his tracks and felt a tingling MUFON UFO Journal, No. 254, June 1989"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"sensation. Calling his parents, Charles saw the object take off and move to the west over the barn roof. The wit- ness and his parents noticed a strong \"sulfurous\" smell around the area where the object had landed. There were other things out of order in the yard. A power lawn mower had apparently rolled about 10 feet from its normal place toward the landing site. Cans that were on a table had fallen off in the same direc- tion. A hoe was located 50 feet away from its stand against the house. It, too, was near the landing site. A water trough had been overturned. There was also a small burned area with three indentations forming a tri- angle and measuring nearly an inch in depth and diameter. Also, all of the cherry trees and garden plants around the landing area died after the sighting. On the 29th, businessman Beauford E. Parham was driving between Car- nesville and Lavonia, Georgia when he spotted a very bright light in the sky coming directly toward his car. \"The car's engine seemed like it was about to stop — maybe like some- thing a magnet would do. The next instance it was directly in front of my headlights spinning like a giant toy top. It made a hissing sound like a million snakes. The top part of the craft was moving in a clockwise direc- tion and the bottom part in a counter- clockwise direction.\" The vehicle, \"big enough to hold a man,\" was amber- colored, about six feet tall and eight feet wide. A tower-like projection with a dark band was seen at the top. Vane-like configuratioins were also observed. Small portholes dotted the bottom, through which flames could be detected. Disappearing in a flash, the craft reappeared a second time. \"It stayed directly in front of my headlights for at least a mile, never touching the car but spinning just in front of my head- lights,\" said Parham. Although he was traveling at 65 m.p.h., the vehicle kept an estimated five feet in front of the automobile and only one or two feet above the road. The top part of the craft was tilted toward the wit- ness. Parham said he followed in a near trance-like state and that the object gave off terrific heat that burned his arm. \"When the vehicle MUFON UFO Journal, No. 254, June 1989 left it suddenly went up over the top of my car, leaving a strong odor like embalming fluid and a very gaseous vapor which left an oily substance all over my car. I drove on to Lavonia and by this time my arm was really burning. I don't mind telling you I was mighty frightened. It left me so shaken I could hardly continue driving.\" Near Turnerville, Georgia — about 25 miles northwest of Lavonia — a group of people who saw the craft the same night, described it as Parham did and said it came close to the ground. Parham said he was told that two days after his experience a woman sustained third degree burns from a similar craft, near the same location, that burned into a sack of groceries in her car. On the 30th, D.E. Welford said a huge, spinning object — shaped like a toy top — about the size of an auto- mobile and giving off an offensive odor, came into sight as he traveled U.S. 29 near the South Carolina border. Welford said a geiger counter check of his car later showed signs of radioactivity. *** TWENTY YEARS AGO - June 1969: Robin Peck was traveling in his automobile from King's Lynn, Eng- land, to his home in Docking shortly after midnight on the 19th. He was passing through Bircham Newton at 12:25 when his headlights started to flicker. Then both his lights and engine ceased to function. Peck got out and looked under the hood. He felt something like \"static electricity\" and said his hair stood on end. Look- ing up, he saw an inverted mushroom- shaped object bigger than a house hovering at an altitude of 100-150 feet over some trees on a farm. \"There was an orange glow around it and there was very heavy static electricity in the air,\" said Peck. \"It was like standing under a powerful radar transmitter. There was some- thing there but I can't understand what it was. It was a terrifying expe- rience.\" The blue craft hovered for about a minute, then took off and disappeared rapidly. Peck's car func- tioned normally after the vehicle left the area. During the sighting Peck's lu- minous wrist watch glowed with greatly increased power — the light from the watch seemed to stream out toward him. After the encounter the watch no longer was luminous. *** TEN YEARS AGO - June 1979: In a mind-boggling close encounter, an illiterate Brazilian night watchman was abducted by dwarf-like beings — and held over two hours while they examined him on board their extra- terrestrial craft. Under hypnosis, Anto- nio Ferreira, 21, told exactly the same story he'd told when he first revealed the abduction. Antonio was working as a night watchman at a construc- tion site near Mirassol, Brazil, when he saw \"a strange craft\" descending about 60 yards away. \"I came face to face with three dwarf-like beings, each about three feet tall. One carried a small box which beamed a red type of light at me, and I felt paralyzed,\" said Antonio. \"The beings were dressed in a type of jump suit, shiny white, which covered their entire bodies, even their heads. Antonio remembers being raised into the air by an unseen force and moved into a tiny, oval-shaped vehi- cle. The inside of the gray metallic craft was filled with a red light and contained small gray benches and a button-covered panel. \"There was a low rumbling sound and a chill ran up my spine,\" he recalled. \"We entered a larger vehicle and I was taken to a very large room. There were between 10 and 12 beings present. Some of them were brown and others were green. Their heads were very large in relation to their bodies. Their eyes and mouths were very large and their ears were large and pointed. I had never heard their language before. They made me sit down. The next thing I knew I was back at the con- struction site. It was 5:30 in the morn- ing. I ran home.\" Police investigator Jose Zanvello Neto went to the site where Antonio told him the craft had landed. \"There was a circular area completely devoid of the dust, dirt and sawdust which marks the rest of the site.

Webb MUFON Astronomy Consultant June 1989 Bright Planets (Evening Sky): Venus (magnitude -3.9) remains very low in the WNW after sunset, setting about 9:45 daylight time in midmonth. The thin crescent Moon passes 2° above the brilliant planet on June 4. Mars, dimming further to 1.8 magnitude, moves from Gemini into Cancer and stands in the western sky about 16° to the upper left of Venus in mid- June. The reddish world sets about 10:45 in midmonth. The lunar crescent lies 3° above the fading planet on the 6th. After taking preliminary pictures of its Martian target moon, the orbiting Soviet Phobos 2 craft failed to reestablish contact, dooming the rest of the mission. Three planets and an asteroid team up within a small region above the \"teapot\" of Sagittarius. Still brightening Saturn (magnitude 0.1) passes only 18 minutes of arc below the telescopic planet Neptune (magnitude 7.9) on the 24th — the second of a triple conjunction between the pair this year. About 8° to the west lie Uranus (5.6 magnitude) and, 3° NE of the latter, Vesta (5.3 magnitude), the brightest and third largest (334 miles in diame- ter) of the minor planets or asteroids. Uranus and Vesta are opposite the Sun on the 24th and 25th-26th, respectively, making them theoretically vis- ible with the unaided eye. Still, it is advisable to use binoculars to spot the two objects. On June 24 Uranus is located at R.A. 18h 15m, Dec. -23° 40' (1989 coordinates); on the 25th Vesta can be found at 18h 20m and -21° 09' (2000 coordinates). Saturn rises in the ESE about an hour after sunset. Bright Planets (Morning Sky): Jupiter (magnitude -1.9) moves into the morning sky on June 9 but does not emerge from the solar glare until month's end when it rises in the ENE about 4AM. (Look for Mercury a few degrees to the upper right of Jup- iter.) Saturn is low in the SW at dawn. Moon Phases: New moon — June 3 First quarter — June 11 Full moon — June 19 Last quarter — June 26 ^.^ C~j The Stars: The celestial meridian at 11 PM divides the night sky into springtime stars in the west (Leo, Bootes, Virgo) and summer stars in the east. The Summer Triangle is now fully visible above the eastern horizon. Hercules, with his little four-sided \"Keystone\"; Ophiuchus the Serpent Bearer, shaped like a large tent; Scorpius, with its reddish heart star Antares; and Sagittarius the Archer all occupy the eastern half of the sky. Straddling the meridian in the south is the upside-down crown of Ariadne, Corona Borealis, and lower down a distorted rectangle, Libra the Scales, on which nearby Virgo weighs the fate of mortals. To the north the Big Dipper starts its downward arc in the NW, and the hard-to-see sprawling outline of Draco the Dragon coils overhead between the Big and Little Dippers and Hercules.

He doesn't drink and has never been involved with drugs. As far as I am concerned Antonio was taken aboard a space- craft by extraterrestrial beings.\" Dr. Walter Buhler, physician and longtime Ufologist participated in the investiga- tion and concluded: \"The facts speak for themselves. He was truly kid- napped by extraterrestrial beings.\" Antonio was given medical and psy- chological exams at a local hospital by Dr. Luiz Fernando, who said: \"The story that Antonio told could not have come from his imagination.\" MUFON UFO Journal, No. 254, June 1989 MUFON 1989 International UFO Symposium Aladdin Hotel and Casino - Las Vegas, Nevada June 30, July 1 and 2,1989 - Speaking Program - Saturday, July 1,1989 9:00 - 9:05 a.m. Welcome to Las Vegas, John Lear, Co-Host Chairman and State Director for Nevada Introduction of Hal Starr, Co-Host Chairman, M.C. and State Direc- tor for Arizona 9:05 - 9:10 a.m. Greetings from the International Director, Walter H.
