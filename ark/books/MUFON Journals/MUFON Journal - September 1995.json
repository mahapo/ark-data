The following day, July 8, 1947, pieces of the wreckage were flown to 8th Air Force headquarters at Carswell Field, Fort Worth, Texas, where Brigadier General Roger Ramey declared them to be those of an ordinary weather balloon. Schiff's interest in the matter had actually begun a year or two earlier. As early as March of 1993, according to Fred Whiting (MUFON Journal, March 1994, p. 12). Schiff had written then Secretary of Defense Les Aspin. asking for a written report and a briefing by Pentagon of- ficials as to what had actually happened. Silence ensued. A second request, eventually responded to, struck the congressman as a runaround. In October of 1993, Schiff finally took the matter up with Charles Bowhser, Comptroller General of the GAO, which the House Government Operations Committee, of which Schiff is a member, oversees. While blessed with prodigious prowess when it comes to determining how government works, that is, how your tax dollars are spent, the GAO is just what it's name im- plies, an accounting office, as opposed, say, to a policing agency with unlimited powers. In effect, it investigates the government's handling of its own documents, which, in turn, reflect government expenditures and behavior. The GAO was not investigating the incident itself, nor was it supposed to. Meanwhile, the Air Force initiated its own supposed Roswell study, releasing the results in September of 1994. Uncharacteristically, what should have been an intra-gov- ernment report released first to the GAO and Congressman Schiff, was instead made public at a routine weekly briefing for the press. The Air Force admitted to a white lie. According to Colonel Weaver, the report's au- thor, the weather balloon story first put forth in Fort Worth had been intended to conceal another type of highly-classified balloon array known collectively as Project Mogul, designed to detect Soviet A-bomb tests. That report has been criticized for sins of both commis- sion and omission. At any rate, the GAO report has finally been released, and MUFON reprints it here as a public ser- vice. The following copy was found on the Internet, specifically the World Wide Web home page of the Federation of American Scientists.

On July 28, 1995, the office of Congressman Schiff is- sued the following press release: Schiff Receives, Releases'Roswell Report (missing documents leave unanswered questions) Washington: Congressman Steve Schiff today released the General Accounting Office (GAO) report detailing re- sults of a records audit related to events surrounding a crash in 1947, near Roswell, New Mexico, and the mili- tary response. The 20 [-] page report is the result of constituent in- formation requests to Congressman Schiff and the diffi- culty he had getting answers from the Department of Defense in the now 48-year-old controversy. Schiff said important documents, which may have shed more light on what happened at Roswell, are miss- ing. \"The GAO report states that the outgoing messages from Roswell Army Air Field (RAAF) for this period of time were destroyed without proper authority.\" Schiff pointed out that these messages would have shown how military officials in Roswell were explaining to their su- periors exactly what happened. \"It is my understanding that these outgoing messages were permanent records, which should never have been destroyed. The GAO could not identify who destroyed the messages, or why.\" But Schiff pointed out that the GAO estimates that the messages were destroyed over 40 years ago, making further inquiry about their destruction impractical. Documents revealed by the report include an FBI tele- type and reference in a newsletter style internal forum at RAAF that refer to a \"radar tracking device\" — a refer- ence to a weather balloon. Even though the weather bal- loon story has since been discredited by the US Air Force, Schiff suggested that the authors of those communications may have been repeating what they were told, rather than consciously adding to what some believe is a \"cover up.\" \"At least this effort caused the Air Force to acknowl- edge that the crashed vehicle was no weather balloon,\" Schiff said. \"That explanation never fit the fact of high military security used at the time.\" The Air Force in September, 1994 claimed that the crashed vehicle was a then-classified device to detect evidence of possible Soviet nuclear testing. Schiff also praised the efforts of the GAO, describing their work as \"professional, conscientious and thorough.\" A two [-] page letter discussing a related investigation into \"Majestic 12\" was also delivered. Schiff will be available to the media Saturday, July 29th, from 10:00 AM to 2:00 PM at 2404 Rayburn HOB in Washington, DC and by telephone.

Schiff House of Representatives Dear Mr. Schiff: On July 8, 1947, the Roswell Army Air Field (RAAF) public information office in Roswell, New Mexico, reported the crash and recovery of a \"flying disc.\" Army Air Forces personnel from the RA AFs 509th Bomb Group were credited with the recovery. The following day, the press reported that the Commanding General of the U.S. Eighth Air Force, Fort Worth, Texas, announced that RAAF personnel had recovered a crashed radar-tracking (weather) balloon, not a \"flying disc.\" After nearly 50 years, speculation continues on what crashed at Roswell. Some observers believe that the object was of extraterrestrial origin. In the July 1994 Report of Air Force Research Regarding the Roswell Incident, the Air Force did not dispute that something happened near Roswell, but reported that the most likely source of the wreckage was from a balloon-launched classified government project designed to determine the state of Soviet nuclear weapons research. The debate on what crashed at Roswell continues. Concerned that the Department of Defense (DOD) may not have provided you with all available information on the crash, you asked us to determine the requirements for reporting air accidents similar to the crash near Roswell and identify any government records concerning the Roswell crash. We conducted an extensive search for government records related to the crash near Roswell. We examined a wide range of classified and unclassified documents dating from July 1947 through the 1950s. These records came from numerous organizations in New Mexico and elsewhere throughout DOD as well as the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), and the National Security Council. The full scope and methodology of our work are detailed at the end of this report. RESULTS IN BRIEF In 1947, Army regulations required that air accident reports be maintained permanently. We identified four air accidents reported by the Army Air Forces in New Mexico during July 1947. All of the accidents involved military aircraft and occurred after July 8, 1947-the date the RAAF public information office first reported the crash and recovery of a \"flying disc\" near Roswell. The Navy reported no air accidents in New Mexico during July 1947. Air Force officials told us that according to record- keeping requirements in effect during July 1947, there was no requirement to prepare a report on the crash of a weather balloon. In our search for records concerning the Roswell crash, we learned that some government records covering RAAF activities had been destroyed and others had not. For example, RAAF administrative records (from Mar. 1945 through Dec. 1949) and RAAF outgoing messages (from Oct. 1946 through Dec. 1949) were destroyed. The document disposition form does not indicate what organization or person destroyed the records and when or under what authority the records were destroyed. Our search for government records concerning the Roswell crash yielded two records originating in 1947~a July 1947 history report by the combined 509th Bomb Group and RAAF and an FBI teletype message dated July 8, 1947. The 509th- RAAF report noted the recovery of a \"flying disc\" that was later determined by military officials to be a radar- SEPTEMBER 1995    NUMBER 329     PAGES"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL tracking balloon. The FBI message stated that the military had reported that an object resembling a high-altitude • weather balloon with a radar reflector had been recovered near Roswell. The other government records we reviewed, including those previously withheld from the public because of security classification, and the Air Force's analysis of unidentified flying object/ sightings from 1946 to 1953 (Project Blue Book Special Report No. 14), did not mention the crash or the recovery of an airborne object near Roswell in July 1947. Similarly, executive branch agencies' responses to our letters of inquiry produced no other government records on the Roswell crash. 1 According to Air Force regulation, an unidentified flying object is an airborne object that by performance, aerodynamic characteristics, or unusual features, does not conform to known aircraft or missiles, or does not correspond to Air Force definitions of familiar or known objects or unidentified aircraft. REPORTING AIR ACCIDENTS According to press accounts from July 1947, Army Air Forces personnel from RAAF were involved in the recovery of an airborne object near Roswell. Therefore, if an air accident report was prepared, it should have been prepared in accordance with Army regulations. According to an Army records management official, in 1947 Army regulations required that air accident reports be maintained permanently. An Air Force official said there was no similar requirement to report a weather balloon crash. According to an Air Force official who has worked in the records management field since the mid-1940s, air accident reports prepared in July 1947 under Army regulations should have been transferred to Air Force custody in September 1947, when the Air Force was established as a separate service. The Air Force Safety Agency is responsible for maintaining reports of air accidents. We examined its microfilm records to determine whether any air accidents had been reported in New Mexico during July 1947. We identified four air accidents during this time period.2 All of the accidents involved military fighter or cargo aircraft and occurred after July 8,1947— the date the RAAF public information office first reported the crash and recovery of a \"flying disc\" near Roswell. According to the Army Air Forces' Report of Major Accident, these four accidents occurred at or near the towns of Hobbs, Albuquerque, Carrizozo, and Alamogordo, New Mexico. Only one of the four accidents resulted in a fatality. The pilot died when the aircraft crashed during an attempted take-off. 2 These records do not include information regarding mishaps of air Vehicles belonging to civilian or other government agencies. These records also do not include mishaps involving unmanned air vehicles such as remotely piloted aircraft, low-speed cruise missiles, and most balloons. SEARCH FOR RECORDS In searching for government records on the Roswell crash, we were particularly interested in identifying and reviewing records of military units assigned to RAAF in 1947~to include the 509th Bomb Group, the 1st Air Transport Unit, the 427th Army Air Force Base Unit, and the 1395th Military Police Company (Aviation). Document disposition forms obtained from the National Personnel Records Center in St. Louis, Missouri, indicate that in 1953, the Walker Air Force Base (formerly RAAF) records officer transferred to the Army's Kansas City records depository the histories of units stationed at Walker Air Force Base. These histories included the 509th Bomb Group and RAAF for February 1947 through October 1947; the 1st Air Transport Unit for July 1946 through June 1947; and the 427th Army Air Force Base Unit for January 1946 to February 1947. We could not locate any documentation indicating that records of the 1395th Military Police Company (Aviation) were ever retired to the National Personnel Records Center or its predecessor depositories. The July 1947 history for the 509th Bomb Group and RAAF stated that the RAAF public information office \"was kept quite busy ... answering inquiries on the 'flying disc,' which was reported to be in [the] possession of the 509th Bomb Group. The object turned out to be a radar tracking balloon.\" By his signature, the RAAFs commanding officer certified that the report represented a complete and accurate account of RAAF activities in July 1947. (Excerpts from the report are contained in app. I.) In addition to unit history reports, we also searched for other government records on the Roswell crash. In this regard, the Chief Archivist for the National Personnel Records Center provided us with documentation indicating that (1) RAAF records such as finance and accounting, supplies, buildings and grounds, and other general administrative matters from March 1945 through December 1949 and (2) RAAF outgoing messages from October 1946 through December 1949 were destroyed. According to this official, the document disposition form did not properly indicate the authority under which the disposal action was taken. The Center's Chief Archivist stated that from his personal experience, many of the Air Force organizational records covering this time period were destroyed without entering a citation for the governing disposition authority. Our review of records control forms showing the destruction of other records-including outgoing RAAF messages for 1950-supports the Chief Archivist's viewpoint. PAGE 6     NUMBER 329    SEPTEMBER 1995"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL During our review of records at FBI headquarters, we found a July 8.1947, teletype message from the FBI office in Dallas, Texas, to FBI headquarters and the FBI office in Cincinnati, Ohio. An FBI spokesperson confirmed the authenticity of the message. According to the message, an Eighth Air Force headquarters official had telephonically informed the FBI's Dallas office of the recovery near Roswell of a hexagonal-shaped disc suspended from a large balloon by cable. The message further stated that the disc and balloon were being sent to Wright Field (now Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio) for examination. According to the Eighth Air Force official, the recovered object resembled a high-altitude weather balloon with a radar reflector. The message stated that no further investigation by the FBI was being conducted. (A copy of the teletype message appears in app. II.) To follow up on the July 8th message, we reviewed microfilm abstracts of the FBI Dallas and Cincinnati office activities for July 1947. An abstract prepared by the FBI Dallas office on July 12,1947, summarized the particulars of the July 8th message. There was no mention in the Cincinnati office abstracts of the crash or recovery of an airborne object near Roswell. Because the FBI message reported that debris from the Roswell crash was being transported to Wright Field for examination, we attempted to determine whether military regulations existed for handling such debris. We were unable to locate any applicable regulation. As a final step, we reviewed Air Materiel Command (Wright Field) records from 1947 to 1950 for evidence of command personnel involvement in this matter. We found no records mentioning the Roswell crash or the examination by Air Materiel Command personnel of any debris recovered from the crash. QUERIES TO FEDERAL AGENCIES REGARDING RECORDS ON THE CRASH We sent letters to several federal agencies asking for any government records they might have concerning the Roswell crash. In this regard, we contacted DOD, the National Security Council, the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, the CIA, the FBI, and the Department of Energy. The National Security Council, the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, and the Department of Energy responded that they had no government records relating to the Roswell crash. (Copies of their responses appear in app. HI, IV, and V.) The FBI, DOD, and the CIA provided the following information. FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION The FBI informed us that all FBI data regarding the crash near Roswell had been processed under Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests previously received by the Bureau. We reviewed the FBI's FOIA material and identified the July 8, 1947, FBI teletype message discussing the recovery near Roswell of a high-altitude weather balloon with a radar reflector. (A copy of the FBI's response appears in app. VI.) DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE DOD informed us that the U.S. Air Force report of July 1994, entitled Report of Air Force Research Regarding the Roswell Incident, represents the extent of DOD records or information concerning the Roswell crash. The Air Force report concluded that there was no dispute that something happened near Roswell in July 1947 and that all available official materials indicated the most likely source of the wreckage recovered was one of the project MOGUL balloon trains. At the time of the Roswell crash, project MOGUL was a highly classified U.S. effort to determine the state of Soviet nuclear weapons research using balloons that carried radar reflectors and acoustic sensors. (A copy of DOD's response appears in app. VII.) CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY In March 1995, the CIA's Executive Director responded to our letter of inquiry by stating that earlier searches by the CIA for records on unidentified flying objects produced no information pertaining to the Roswell crash. The Executive Director added, however, that it was unclear whether the CIA had ever conducted a search for records specifically relating to Roswell. In the absence of such assurance, the Executive Director instructed CIA personnel to conduct a comprehensive records search for information relating to Roswell. On May 30,1995, the CIA's Executive Director informed us that a search against the term \"Roswell, New Mexico,\" in all CIA databases produced no CIA documents related to the crash. (A copy of CIA's response appears in app. VIII.) AGENCY COMMENTS A draft of this report was provided to DOD for comment. DOD offered no comments or suggested changes to the report. The Chief Archivist, National Personnel Records Center offered several comments clarifying matters dealing with records management. These comments have been incorporated into the final report where appropriate. SEPTEMBER 1995    NUMBER 329     PAGE 7"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL The CIA, the Department of Energy, the FBI, the National Security Council, and the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy also received excerpts from the report discussing the activities of their respective agencies. They had no substantive comments and made no suggested changes to the report. SCOPE AND METHODOLOGY To determine the requirements for reporting air accidents in 1947, we interviewed military service records management officials, reviewed military record-keeping regulations in effect during this time period, and examined Army Air Forces and Navy air accident reports. We also sought to identify any government records related to the Roswell crash. In this regard, we visited and reviewed records at the locations listed in table 1.

PACES NUMBER 3Z9 SEPTEMBER 1995"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL Our search of government records was complicated by the fact that some records we wanted to review were missing and there was not always an explanation. Further, the records management regulations for the retention and disposition of records were unclear or changing during the period we reviewed.

This growing new trend is a concern to a number of re- searchers and health area professionals who work with abductees. M any abductees who once reported tremendous fear of being taken repeatedly from their bed- rooms and cars by non-human entities are now reporting being told by these entities that it was for their own good; that their fear was unwarranted and was simply a product of the abductee's lack of under- standing. In many cases, abductees who accept this ex- planation are also led to believe that technological ad- vancement equals spiritual advancement. There is no logical reasoning for this, as spiritual advancement may run parallel to technological advancement, the two may not proceed along together at the same pace, or they may not run along together at all. We cannot assume that where we find one we will find the other. I believe the reasoning put forth by these abductees to justify abduction is faulty. I am a hypnotherapist in Santa Barbara, California, working with abductees. I became personally involved in this situation when I watched two members of our support group change their stories from one meeting to the next. These were abductees who had been terrorized and abused for years and had only hatred for their abductors. Suddenly, their stories changed and they both, independently of each other, began saying that recently they were shown that everything that had been done to them was for their own good and facilitated their spiritual growth. With regards to this, Dr. Karla Turner, in a paper she presented to the MUFON 1994 International UFO Symposium, said the following: \"It is odd, however, that such growth seems to come to abductees only after they are aware of their experiences. If indeed this growth is produced by the aliens, then it should have been there long before the abductees were conscious of their en- counters, since in almost every reported case there is evidence of alien involvement since early childhood. The psychic increase and growth of perceptive abilities indicate a different genesis — an internal evolution of consciousness — stemming from our need to know what is and has been done to us and what we can -do to meet the situation in a more empowered state. Survivors of great catastrophes such as hurricanes, earthquakes, and war may be crushed by the impact of these events ... or they may find a new resilience, rising to the occasion and reacting with abilities they didn't know they possessed. Given the vast intrusive activities of the abduction sce- nario, our species may well feel such a threat or stress that a mutational or evolutionary leap is occurring today ... If this is indeed the case, then any spiritual growth is the abductee's own doing at a deep level of conscious- ness and is not coming from an abducting entity. There can be a number of reasons why an abductee changes his mind. One that has been put forth a number of times is what is termed the Stockholm Syndrome, aka the Hostage Syndrome, where a person who has been kidnapped or captured eventually comes to sympathize with and even grow fond of his captors. With some ab- ductees, I believe that this may be occurring. However, I think we are seeing something else happening with this attitude change that goes beyond the easy answer of the Stockholm Syndrome. Because I was disturbed by the attitude change of the abductees I knew and of many others I had been hearing about, I wrote a letter in February to a group of ab- ductees who were reachable through computer online services. I also posted my letter to a number of bul- letin boards on the Internet and asked that abductees please respond with their thoughts and feelings about the situation. I'd like to mention a few of the points I made in my letter and then share with all of you some of the responses I received from people. In my letter, I stated that by the very meaning of the word, abduction implies being taken against one's will with no say in the matter. It can include experiencing painful physical procedures, being lied to and given screen memories, being mentally terrorized, and being paralyzed, manipulated and controlled. There is nothing spiritual about any of these things and yet the abductors say they are highly advanced spiritual beings. It is very interesting that these non-human entities seem to have learned two ways to control human beings — through fear and through acceptance. Obviously we are seeing some abductees who are still being controlled and ma- nipulated through fear, but we are also seeing abductees being controlled and manipulated through their accep- tance of these entities as spiritual beings. By accepting these beings as highly spiritual, the abductee gives up seeking to end his abduction experiences and instead starts to welcome them. Instead of abductees coming into a sense of their own power as spiritual beings who do not need to give up their free will to anyone, what we PAGE 10 NUMBER 329 SEPTEMBER 1995"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL are now seeing is a group of submissive, controlled ab- ductees who are passively letting the abductors do as they want with them in the name of spiritual progress. In my opinion, anything that keeps a person from learning the truth and from taking responsibility for his own growth and awakening as a spiritual being is completely unspiritual. Anything that allows the person his free will, responsibility for his own spiritual progress and aids in the process of discovering his true unbounded spiritual nature is truly spiritual. I don't think it is diffi- cult to see into which category the abductors fall. I be- lieve that we have spiritual entities in our midst, beings who are assisting humans with their evolution, but I'm quite sure that these spiritual beings are not the same as those who are responsible for the abductions. In my letter I also stated that the entire hybrid sce- nario could be a fantastic cover for an agenda that is completely different than we are being shown. As Dr. Karla Turner has stated in radio interviews, it is almost as though abductees are shown the same movies, as a cover for other motives completely unknown to us, or possibly they are using the hybrid scenario to study our emotions. Things should not be taken at face value when we know we are dealing with entities who can im- plant thoughts into our heads, manipulate our minds with screen memories and virtual reality scenes, and who pass themselves off as wonderful spiritual beings. We presently have no way to know the truth about what is really happening. I 'd like to quote part of a letter I received from an ab- ductee, Irene Rea in Oregon. She writes, \"One of the most frightening aspects of this phenomenon is the ab- ductor's ability to manipulate the abductee's percep- tions. I'm frightened by the current trend that many ab- ductees seem to be going through in assigning the ab- ductors benign motives in the spiritual growth of the ab- ductees and planetary healing. In my experience, the ab- ductors have manipulated my reality over and over. In one very telling instance, my partner and I were ab- ducted together. He thought he was being wooed by a gorgeous and astoundingly remarkable woman. My view of his experience was that he was on a table, strapped to medical gear, and staring into the eyes of a typical 'grey.' I find it even more abusive to be told by my fellow abductees that the reason I'm experiencing these negative experiences is because I'm somehow spiritually unadvanced. As a two-decade veteran of the New Age, I have heard this kind of spiritual elitism from the devout followers of alleged spiritual leaders who were, in fact, promoting their own agendas of power and greed.\" Another letter from an abductee, Dana Buyers of Los Angeles, California: \"We are nothing more to these beings than a crop to be harvested. They terrorized me, hurt me and nearly ruined my health. An abuser is an abuser. I don't care what planet they come from or how intelligent they claim to be. So when I get the impulse from them to start thinking that they aren't so bad after all and are just pursuing some noble purpose that we can't understand, I show them in my mind all that they have done to me and I say 'get real,' there is no way that I'm ever going to change my mind. These aliens are dangerous, don't ever believe them.\" And a letter from abductee Amy Hebert of Carrollton, Texas: \"As a facilitator of an abductee support group, I have observed abductees' reactions change from deep contempt and anger toward their abductors to acceptance and complete surrender. Some abductees express years and years of anger and confusion, then suddenly an- nounce they don't think the aliens are really so bad after all and may actually represent some type of spiritual ex- perience. These reactions seem quite surprising, con- sidering the levels of anger and humiliation the ab- ductee expressed only a week before. Could these new feelings be due to the resolution of the individual's long term hatred and resentment toward the abductors? Or, could this be yet another example of alien manipulation? According to Dr. Karla Turner, aliens have been known to lie to abductees for their own purposes and all ab- ductions take place in an alien-controlled environment. These alien-human hate-love relationships seem to re- flect alien control more than any spiritually fulfilling promise for humankind. After all, kidnapping and forc- ing someone to be a guinea pig can hardly be considered spiritual.\" I want to give one last letter I received from a man who is in training as a body-centered psychotherapist, Mark Richards of Boston, Massachusetts. He writes, \"It's of little doubt that the internal confusion and pain resulting from one or more abduction experiences results in some form of compensation. Just as 'screen memory' tends to re-shape the horrific experience into more palat- able images, it's possible that this same re-shaping oc- curs at many other levels, notwithstanding the body's cellular memory. Given the infinite variety and creativ- ity of the whole mind, how is it that hypnotic recollec- tions of the victims, often including deeply felt sensory experiences, have such striking parallels? Could it be that a 'cult' of some type is forming and having influ- ence upon the story? ... Culture and historical factors may strongly influence what comes forth. Here in our technological, educated and motive culture, when some- thing doesn't make sense in our head, we switch to \"faith,\" to a spirituality of some sort. Once this switch occurs, we have a \"cult,\" and in the case of abductees as a group, a 'cult'-ure built around technological un- knowns. Perhaps all semblance of reason is not lost, just put on hold for a while as the body (collective and individual) tries to make some sense out of stuff that cannot possibly find correlation. This trend among the abductee community has not been so named, perhaps out of the same denial which seems to be increasingly preva- lent in the various stories ... stories that have begun to SEPTEMBER 1995 NUMBER 329 PAGE 11"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL shift in character and substance. Now abduction is no longer a horrible violation but a necessary component of a great plan. Now the aliens who are beaming into our bedrooms are no longer uninvited violators of the human story, but welcome harbingers of our 'salvation.' The parallels between various religious mythological systems and the growing abductee community are striking. They spring from the same set of unknowns, growing in the fertile ground of fear and imagination, a set of ideas con- cerning the history, purpose and future of the human race.\". W ith all the confusion that surrounds the abduction phenomenon and all the various ways of looking at the phenomenon itself, it is impossible for anyone to say with certainty, that they know what is true. People need to analyze why they believe what they believe and not allow themselves to accept a belief just be- cause it fits nicely into their world picture. I know that it takes strength and courage to put aside a glowing, pos- itive picture and admit that you really just don't know for sure. But the only way we are going to come up with any answers is if people question what they are being told and shown. Don't accept someone else's explana- tions (whether it be that of another abductee, a channeled source, or a non-human entity).

Pflock T hose who contend the \"Roswell incident\" debris discovered in late spring or early summer 1947 by New Mexico rancher W. W. (\"Mac\") Brazel was the wreckage of an extraterrestrial spacecraft offer up a mixed bag of \"evidence\" in their attempts to discount the more mundane, and in my considered opinion, correct, explanation that the junk was the remains of a huge balloon-borne instrumentation array launched from nearby Alamogordo Army Air Base by a scientific and technical team from New York University (NYU) sup- porting the Army Air Forces' top secret Project Mogul. For example, they cite Roswell Army Air Field in- telligence officer Major Jesse A. Marcel's claim that he was familiar with all American airborne vehicles and equipment and most such foreign devices, even the special radar targets being flown by the NYU group. The fact is, however, he wasn't. [1] They also point out that a matter of days before the Roswell story hit the head- lines, a farmer living near Circleville, Ohio, discovered a weather balloon \"covered with aluminum foil\" and sporting a \"kite-like appendage\" somewhere on his back forty, assert he immediately identified it for what it was, and note he suggested such a gadget might ex- plain the flying saucer sightings that at the time had the nation in an uproar. [2] They go on to suggest the Circleville story inspired the Army's weather balloon cover story for Roswell and the substitution of battered radar targets and weathered (very) neoprene balloon fragments for the real extraterrestrial debris to back it up.[3] The Circleville event may have suggested the cover story ginned up to protect Mogul, but only because most if not all of the Mogul-Roswell wreckage shown to and photographed by the press was battered radar targets and weathered (very) neoprene balloon fragments. While it seems likely portions of the debris which might have given rise to difficult media questions and possible ex- posure of Mogul were kept under wraps (e.g., a sonobuoy more usually deployed at sea than in the skies of New Mexico), nothing was switched, nor, given the time available and other inescapable facts, could it have been. [4] Champions of debris Roswellans extraterrestrialis further aver that the fact the Circleville weather device quickly was identified for what it was all but proves Roswell could not have involved something similar, if considerably more extensive. [5] But this is not neces- sarily so. Recently, during a visit to the National Archives to do research on other UFO cases, I chanced upon docu- ments which revealed that pesky radar targets were giv- ing Air Force and other authorities flying saucer fits more than three years after Roswell. These memoranda are located on roll 90 of the Project Blue Book micro- film, which contains UFO and UFO-related reports from district offices of the Air Force Office of Special Investigations (OSI) during the period 1949-1967. On January 9, 1951, the assistant executive for special investigations in the Office of the Inspector General of the Air Force forwarded a memorandum from the com- mander of OSI District 4, Boiling Air Force Base, Washington, D.C., to the director of special investiga- tions in the headquarters of the Military Air Transport Service (MATS), Andrews Air Force Base, Maryland.

Gillette was \"Radar Targets — Corner Reflectors.\" It read: \"1. It has been determined that the Air Weather Service, USAF [a MATS component] has, in connection with their [sic] studies of winds aloft, launched Corner Reflectors (Radar Targets). These targets do not bear any stamps, tags, or other data which would serve to identify it [sic] for what it [sic] is. Consequently, on a number of occasions, persons who have found these targets or have sighted them in flight have reported them to military OSI, Police, and FBI authorities as 'flying saucers,' or as some other type of unconventional aircraft. \"2. The Air Weather Service does not desire the return of these targets once they have been launched and served their purpose [,] inasmuch as they are of no intrinsic value. \"3. Recently, one such target was sighted and recov- ered on a farm in Eastern Maryland. A report was re- ceived that a 'flying saucer' or 'disk' had been ob- served in flight and it had landed in this particular lo- cality. Two (2) OSI Agents, FBI Agents and a Maryland State Trooper expended 1 1/2 days in locating the object and interviewing the individual who had sighted the object. This time and expense would undoubtedly have been unnecessary had the target born [sic] a simple stamp to the effect that it was a weather target and that if found it could be retained by the finder. The targets themselves are susceptible to such stamps or markings [,] and it is urged that consideration be given to com- municating directly with the Air Weather Service in connection with this suggestion.\" Colonel Gillette's recommendation was bucked to the chief of the Air Weather Service at Andrews Air Force Base on January 15, 1951. On January 22, 1951, Captain Kenneth M. Fulcher, assistant adjutant general of the Air Weather Service, sent this memo back up his chain of command to the commander of MATS: \"1. All AWS [Air Weather Service] units which use Corner Reflectors (Radar Targets) will be instructed to indicate on the target that it is a weather target and may be retained by the finder. \"2. The Signal Corps [the army component then—and in 1947—responsible for procuring radar targets for both Army and Air Force] will be requested to have sim- ilar information stamped on the radar targets by the manufacturer in the future.\" Four days later, Col. Julius A. Kolb, MATS deputy in- spector general, forwarded a copy of Capt. Fulcher's memo to the director of special investigations in the Air Force inspector general's office. It is safe to as- sume that soon thereafter OSI agents everywhere breathed sighs of relief. But then, publication of The Roswell Incident was still 30 years in the future. END NOTES 1. See Todd.

T he question of how much influence an expectation has upon an investigation and subsequent hypnotic regressions is one worth discussing. Critics have ex- pressed the following concerns: (1) When an alleged ab- ductee expects that an abduction occurred, he/she will produce one with the assistance of a suggestive hypnotic trance; (2) When a hypnotherapist expects that an ab- duction occurred, he/she will subtlely encourage the production of an abduction account; (3) The type of scenario and details produced are directly related to what the abductee and hypnotherapist already believe and expect; (4) An abductee will subconsciously pro- duce what he/she believes that the hypnotherapist ex- pects to hear; or (5) Just going to a hypnotherapist who believes in UFOs and works with abductees creates the expectation that one will find that he/she is also an ab- ductee. All of these statements are important points, which — if not analyzed — would naturally cast much doubt upon the reliability of hypnosis and the reality of abductions. CASE #1: Thirty-three-year-old female had resisted the idea of hypnosis for 10 years after her mother had had a session following a UFO sighting which involved both of them. She never knew what her mother had re- called but was a harsh skeptic, often doubting her mother's objectivity and sanity, as well as avoiding books on UFOs. Her curiosity about the hours of \"miss- ing time\" finally drove her to hypnosis to find the sen- sible, logical answers. Working with a different hypno- tist who knew no details of her mother's case, she was shocked, amazed, and humbled to uncover a detailed scenario, shared with her mother, and unknowingly matching at least 23 various aspects of her mother's separate session 10 years earlier. This was certainly not what she had expected! CASE #2: An anxious, thirty-two-year-old married woman approached a hypnotherapist to find a logical so- lution to the 90 minutes she and her mother lost on a fa- miliar route some 20 years earlier. When their shared amnesia had ended simultaneously, they and their car were lost on a different route that they had not seen before. Under hypnosis she is terrified and stunned to re- call an abduction of her mother and herself by little gray men aboard a silver disk. Mother had absolutely no interest in any session until she heard that her daughter had \"learned something.\" The 63-year-old woman tear- fully remembered twice as much detail in her regression, matching her daughter's abduction scenario perfectly. Both were amazed — neither had expected nor wanted these results, but the matching correlations were com- forting arid a form of verification for each of their un- expected but matching accounts. CASE #3: A twenty-seven-year-old female ap- proached a UFO hypnotherapist with excitement, having read books on UFO abductions and clearly remembering a joint sighting with her husband and possible missing time while crossing Nevada at night. Both she and her husband expected that they might have had an abduc- tion. But her hypnosis session only produced a vivid re- living of the UFO sighting and nothing further. This was not what she had expected. Without knowing her re- sults, her husband underwent his own hypnotic session and also recalled exactly what she had — a vivid sight- ing but no abduction. Despite their initial expectations, neither produced an abduction scenario but did nicely match the details of a UFO sighting. CASE #4: A thirty-six-year-old married female ap- proached a UFO researcher determined to get rid of a nagging notion that she might have had a close UFO en- counter twenty years earlier. She did not want any ab- duction experience whatsoever and had not read any books either. The hypnotherapist also doubted that she could have had an encounter and did not expect anything to surface. Despite .both of their doubts and expectations, a two-hour detailed abduction account unfolded under hypnosis much to their surprise. In fact, a friend who had been with her later recalled — without knowing any of these results — a matching story of alien abduction in a hypnosis session with another hypnotherapist 1000 miles away. And he had had no idea of what to expect — nor did that hypnotherapist. CASE #5: A psychologist from Virginia called me be- tween therapy sessions on a busy Wednesday in 1992 to beg for help on a probable case of abduction he had ac- cidentally been uncovering without either he or his client realizing what they were dealing with at all. She had been plagued by nightmares and feelings regarding intrusions by little men into her home and \"fantasies\" of exams in unusual round rooms, etc. He had tried to fit her into a category of Multiple Personality Disorders but knew this was not correct because she was essentially \"normal\" if it were not for these nightmares, feelings of anxiety, and other strange ideas. She also made no con- nections with UFOs or aliens at all and was equally puzzled. But he had just read about UFO abduction scenarios for the first time ever in the \"Unusual Personal Experiences\" booklet from the Roper Organization's study which had been mailed to 100,000 mental health professionals for reactions. He was stunned to see how all of her symptoms fit right into this phenomenon — and how she actually improved by processing her feel- ings with this knowledge and understanding. Neither ex- pected these results nor had known anything about UFO abductions. CASE #6: In a case from El Paso, Texas, a hyp- notherapist trainer was informed by one of his students about the use of hypnosis with alleged UFO abduc- PAGE14 NUMBER 329 SEPTEMBER 1995"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL tions. He listened politely but really knew nothing about it. However, a month or so later, as he was attempting to help a female client with traditional techniques of hyp- notherapy for weight loss, she suddenly broke into emo- tional memories of lying on a table and undergoing an examination by little gray men. This burst of emotion and surprising details astounded him. He immediately referred her to the UFO support network where she was helped by a psychiatrist associated with MUFON. Neither she nor the hypnotherapist had expected that re- action under hypnosis! I n several other cases UFO experiences deliberately went to hypnotherapists who knew nothing about UFO research or what had already been recalled in their first sessions with established UFO hypnotists. These abductees wanted to see if the absence of knowl- edge or any preconceived expectation on the part of the hypnotist would make a difference in how a session progressed. In all of these cases the details of further ab- ductions flowed forth with the same emotions, details, and sincerity — despite the bewilderment and amaze- ment coming from the unsuspecting therapists. To combat the \"pleasing the therapist\" syndrome, the use of deliberate suggestion to attempt to \"trick\" the client into logical answers — which the client believes the hypnotherapist desires to hear — has been used by many therapists to test suggestibility and expectations. The results reported by many researchers are that hardly any subject has been led away from the reporting of the experience that he/she believes has happened. They produce bizarre responses that do not fit what the hyp- notist has suggested but do fit the research data col- lected on UFO abductions. These examples are but a few of many accounts that seem to indicate that expectation has little or no obvious influence on the process of seeking the truth. Carpenter's e-mail address is starmanjc@aol.com MACK - Continued from Page 13 Mack had become a cause celebre at Harvard after the 1994 publication of his best-selling book, \"Abduction.\" In countless television and newspaper in- terviews, he was inevitably dubbed \"the Harvard pro- fessor who believes in UFOs,\" causing considerable anguish to many of his colleagues. The Medical School committee's preliminary report, drafted earlier this year, chastised Mack for \"affirming the delusions\" of his many patients who claim to have been abducted by aliens. The committee also found Mack to be \"in violation of the standards of conduct ex- pected of a member of the faculty of Harvard University.\" Mack, who has taught at Harvard for more than three decades, was a controversial figure even before he began his UFO research five years ago. Alternately described as a restless crusader or an intellectual butterfly, he has plunged himself into the anti-nuclear movement, medi- ation efforts in the Mideast and US-Soviet diplomacy, as well as a variety of alternative therapies, including \"holotropic breathwork\" and est. Mack served on the est board and introduced founder Werner Erhard to Harvard, \"which went over like a lead balloon,\" according to one colleague. Much of Mack's UFO investigations take place at his Cambridge-based Program For Extraordinary Experience Research (PEER). Many of his colleagues first learned of his UFO interests when he co-sponsored a national conference on alien abduction held at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1992. While most of his colleagues privately scoff at the abductees' tales, they do credit Mack with many important contri- butions to psychoanalysis during his 35-year career. Furthermore, many viewed the Medical School's re- view committee as an unacceptable intrusion into Mack's research. \"I would defend to the death John's right to indulge in kooky stuff, in the name of academic freedom,\" said one psychiatrist. The committee, whose proceedings were kept secret, met 25 times between summer 1994 and late spring of this year. Mack appeared several times before the group, as did a handful of his patients and several Harvard psychiatrists, who criticized his abductee research. In the early weeks of the committee's proceedings, Mack and his first lawyer, Carl Sapers of Hill and Barlow, cooperated with the review board, turning over interview tapes and urging patients to tell their stories to the Harvard panel. \"Initially, their approach was, 'What can you do to help us understand this research,'\" said Peter Faust, an abduction \"experiencer\" who testified be- fore the committee. \"Then it became clear that Harvard had another agenda.\" Mack later changed lawyers, engaging first Daniel Sheehan of the far-left Christic^Institute, and then MacLeish, who specializes in mental-health related lit- igation. In an interview earlier this year, a wistful Mack noted that the Harvard investigation \"has been expensive in all senses of the word.\" In documents unrelated to the Harvard inquiry, Mack disclosed that he has already paid $30,000 in legal fees and expects to be billed for $100,000 more. Although Mack derives considerable income from family trust funds, his Harvard salary is $12,000 a year, which is not unusual for a clinician with limited teaching duties.

Dalton, Barnes and Noble, and Bookstop. What began as an attempt to turn her journal entries about her abduction experiences into a coherent narrative has become something of a commercial \"sleeper,\" no pun intended. After Katharina and I had spoken a few times on the phone, we decided to do an interview together for \"The MUFON UFO Journal\" to sort of bring readers up to date on what has been going on with her since the pub- lication of The Alien Jigsaw in 1993. She has continued to have a steady stream of experiences and to gain new insight into the phenomenon from an experiencer's per- spective. \"The Alien Jigsaw covers the first 32 years of my life,\" Wilson said, \"and ends in December of 1992. 1 documented thirty abduction experiences in 1993, and my journal shows fourteen experiences for 1994. I re- sisted documenting my experiences that year because I was trying to force the Beings to interact with me on my terms. I was angry and frustrated with them for using me so long for psychological and physical 'experiments.' I tried to stay angry with them, and my not writing as of- ten was a form of passive resistance.\" Wilson said that some of the fourteen experiences from last year were intended to demonstrate to her that \"other dimensions really exist\" and that \"some people actually exist in more than one dimension and in more than one time.\" As of July of this year, Wilson reported that her ex- periences had changed in tone and character. \"For example,\" Wilson said, \"I'm not being used as much in a psychological and physical sense, although those types of experiences occasionally do occur. I seem to be learning to teleport myself and to use my thoughts to 'move myself through other spaces.' \" The abduction experience often carries with it a deep sense of responsibility. \"Like many abductees,\" Wilson said, \"I feel a great weight upon me, as if I am preparing for an important event to take place. I also feel as if I am, in part, re- sponsible for something very important. I want to make it very clear that I do not feel special because of my ex- periences. Quite the contrary. I feel an enormous burden because of these experiences, and rather than feeling I've been 'chosen,' I feel as if it is my duty or my assignment to help educate people about this phenomenon.\" That burdensome sense of responsibility also in- cludes receiving frightening visions of the earth's future and mankind's own powerlessness in the face of global nuclear and environmental disaster. \"In early 1995,\" Wilson said, \"I had a vision of nu- clear war that I documented in an unpublished paper ti- tled 'Curious Correlations.' The vision showed that China will attack both Russia and the United States with nuclear weapons. They will be carried by red (high performance) jets belonging to the Chinese military. Nuclear weapons and oil are going to be the main 'tools' of this war. \"How do I feel about visions such as these?\" Wilson continued. \"First, I have no idea why I'm receiving in- formation such as this, unless I am supposed to share it with others. It does me no personal good to have to live with this knowledge, if that is indeed what it is. Second, I don't want anything like this to occur, and my life isn't so boring that I would create something like this to make it more interesting. As to the 'reality' of these visions, I can only describe them as being absolutely 'powerful.' When you are seeing these events unfold be- PAGE 16 NUMBER 329 SEPTEMBER 1995"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL fore you, at that moment, you have no choice but to be- lieve them.\" Wilson said that she had also received numerous vi- sions of a personal nature and that many of those had come to pass. \"However,\" she went on, \"I have no idea if these new visions will actually occur. I realize this information can really stretch the imagination, but one possible ex- planation for these 'visions' is: If we exist in other di- mensions, what we are seeing may be real. Perhaps the information is 'spilling over' to those people who exist simultaneously in different dimensions.\" Wilson denies that she is psychic or gifted with any- thing beyond what she calls \"intuition.\" She even points out that during the late 1980's, she participated in a PSI experiment for an Operant Behavior Psychology class and scored only slightly above chance. One of the major themes of The Alien Jigsaw is Wilson's determined rebellion against the authority of \"The Typical Abduction Scenario\" as laid out by major abduction researchers like Budd Hopkins and David Jacobs, who claim that those elements that don't fit into commonly repeated patterns don't deserve inclusion in the literature. \"I still feel very strongly about this,\" Wilson said. \"I agree that a lot of aliens are engaging in what is be- coming known as the alien-human hybridization pro- gram. I also take every moment I can to thank Budd Hopkins for his dedication and courage. The information he published in Missing Time and Intruders has helped thousands of people. A lot of .us would not be here today without his help. \"We are both many other things,\" Wilson continued, \"but on a very basic level, Budd is a researcher and I'm an abductee. When you've experienced teaching dreams, visions, alien theatrics, and shades of govern- ment involvement, you need to know that you are not alone. I've had many, many people tell me 'thank you' for writing about these types of experiences. I know first-hand how important that information is. For me, it has put the abduction phenomenon in an entirely new light. As I stated recently at the MUFON Symposium, 'The hybridization program is very real, but it is only the tip of the iceberg.' This phenomenon is so large that no one researcher is going to be able to view the whole process. It is going to take a lot of different researchers, each with a different focus, to pull all of this information together. One of the few healthy things about the ab- duction phenomenon is that we're not all focusing on one aspect of it.\" Wilson will admit, however, to having experienced some of the elements of the standard abduction sce- nario along with some of her other more individuated experiences. \"I've had sightings of unusually shaped aerial craft,\" Wilson said, \"UFOs if you will. I've also experienced missing time, the sudden appearance of unusual scars, feelings of paralysis, detecting a presence in my room at night and during the day, floating or flying without knowing why or how, and medical examinations in- volving skin scrapings, hair clippings, and gynecologi- cal exams. I've also experienced alien surgical proce- dures such as laparascopic procedures (possible removal of ova), a heart operation, the insertion of rods in my joints, and the insertion of memory stimulating de- vices.\" So, having blended the \"individual\" experience with a healthy dose of the \"communal\" or the \"shared\" ex- perience, Katharina Wilson is equipped to speak to us from both \"typical\" and \"atypical\" perspectives. What she doesn't have in common with other abductees is equally as important as what she does have in com- mon. At one point during the interview, I asked her if she had received any visions about the future of mankind in the long run. \"I was given a vision of 'humanity,' \" she replied. \" 'Humanity' was standing in line inside a mall at a burger joint, content with their minimum wage jobs. They weren't striving for anything more in life. They weren't trying to educate themselves. They weren't try- ing to make a positive difference. They were satisfied. A short pudgy female Being with dark skin and 'funny looking glasses' was standing next to me. She was tele- pathically tuning into my thoughts and feelings. I said to her, 'I can't believe they're satisfied with this. Eating an- imals and existing to work . . . it's unacceptable.' The pudgy female telepathically replied matter-of-factly, 'They are receptacles.' \" \"With these three words,\" Wilson continued, \"her thoughts poured into my mind. In an instant she told me that what I was calling 'unacceptable' was all that these peoples' souls were capable of experiencing. I also felt her say something about their future; that their future and my future would be very different. I wasn't a part of them—I wasn't connected to 'humanity.' \" It is just that very sense of separateness that makes the day-to-day battle of experiencers like Katharina Wilson so vitally important to study and ultimately to under- stand, that makes her struggle and the struggle of others who are both \"like\" and \"unlike\" her so crucial to our troubled evolution and perhaps our very survival. If there is a basic message underlying the abduction phe- nomenon, it may be that whatever originates the expe- rience has chosen to bypass the general masses and concentrate instead on sending it to a very tiny but sta- tistically verifiable minority. And it is a minority that needs people like Katharina Wilson very much. Sean Casteel is a freelance writer with an interest in UFOs and a frequent contributor to these pages.

Box 577, Jefferson Valley NY 10535 — or Stacy — P.O. Box 12434, San Antonio TX 78212; ISSN 1076-4028] Reviewed by George W. Earley P olitical pamphleteering and little 'literary' maga- zines have been with us since colonial times. Anyone with money and talent could produce one, even when talent ran a poor second to money. But it has only been within the past two decades that such new technologies as inexpensive photocopying and computer word processing have joined with in- creasing citizen dissatisfaction with conventional printed media to produce a veritable tidal wave of small spe- cialty publications. The Anomalist, two issues of which are in print with the third due towards the end of 1995, is one of the more recent additions to that wave. The name derives from the word anomaly, which my dictionary defines as: \"Deviation from the normal or common order, form, or rule . . .\" The magazine there- fore encompasses not only ufology but, as editors Stacy and Huyghe put it, \"a whole host of astronomical, bio- logical, psychological, physical, geophysical, linguistic, religious, and archaeological phenomena.\" Readers of this journal, for whom ufology may be the only scientifically incorrect interest in their lives, may therefore be disappointed that only three articles in the first two issues deal with their topic. These are: \"Alien Dreamtime\" by Robert Baker, \"Cargo of the Gods?\" by Paul Rydeen and Huyghe's interview with Mario Pazzaglini on \"Alien Writing.\" Pazzaglini, a clinical psychologist in private prac- tice, became interested in images and symbols in the hippy-fied 60's. About a decade ago, he began studying alleged 'alien writing' and some samples of it illustrate the text of Huyghe's interview with him. For his samples, he has drawn on such ufological contactee/abductee sources as Adamski, Andreasson and Williamson plus such researchers as Budd Hopkins. But, says Pazzaglini, these 'writings' appear to be a consistent part of human history going back to the pre- Christian middle east and also appear in native American tradition. I do find it curious that he makes no mention of the late Richard Shaver's allegedly alien-dictated Mantong alphabet — but then conventional ufologists dismiss Shaver as a nut and accept the view that the so- called \"Shaver Mystery\" was largely invented by sci-fi writer-editor Ray Palmer and therefore deserves to be ig- nored. But should they? Are ufologists here guilty of CSICOPian thinking? /•\" Pazzaglini cautions that he cannot be not sure if the writing truly represents alien contact or if it is generated THE ANOMALIST: 2 • Was the First Kigfoot a Hoax? ' Allen Dreamtime • The Origins of Humanity in Siberia? ' Organ Theft m Guatemala • Mvth. Mutes and More \"purely within ourselves ...\" What we need, of course, is a copy of the alien equivalent of USA Today, a sou- venir no abductee has yet brought back. However, I still believe others should follow Pazzaglini's lead; after all, no studies, no answers. In trying to link South Pacific cargo cults with ufol- ogy, Paul Rydeen, in my estimation, is attempting to spin gold out of straw. The cargo cults, as Rydeen shows, were a logical [to the native minds] outgrowth of the impact of a superior technological culture on an inferior one. The natives benefitted from what European's colonizers, and later the military, brought. When they left, the natives tried [and are still trying] to bring them back by recreating, as best they can, such major symbols of that technology as aircraft and buildings. But to believe that some saucer groups, in their yearn- ings for saucer-riding demigods who will bring [im- pose?] a Golden Age of peace and plenty, are the \"heirs\" of cargo cult thinking is twaddle. At best, the contactees are recycling, and poorly at that, ideas drawn from scores of contact tales spun by science fiction writers over many decades. If ufologists had greater familiarity with 30's and 40's sci-fi, they'd be less likely to be PAGE 18 NUMBER 329 SEPTEMBER 1995"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL taken in by many of today's saucerian speculations, Rydeen's included. The truly controversial piece, where ufologists are concerned, is Robert Baker's highly skeptical assessment of the abductee scene. Baker is a professor emeritus [U. Kentucky] of psychology, a CSICOP Fellow and a \"staunch skeptic of the UFO abduction phenomenon,\" credentials likely to result in instant knee-jerk rejection of his long and heavily referenced article. Baker rejects the alien abduction scenario and bluntly states that \"The argument made by alien abduction pro- ponents that no current medical or psychiatric explana- tion can account [for] these stories is flatly untrue.\" As his article runs nearly 40 pages, plus over 3 pages of ref- erences, any attempt to summarize it would be inade- quate so I shall merely note that he invokes medically well-established and long-known sleep disorder condi- tions as the likely explanation for alien abduction claims/beliefs. Ufologists of course reject Baker's conclusions as flatly as he scants their claims of pervasive abduction- ism. But in the absence of proof [remember Hynek's dic- tum that extraordinary claims require extraordinary proof] I rather think Baker currently has the better of the argument. Cannot the UFO community, which often boasts of the numbers of MD's, psychiatrists and psy- chologists in its ranks, take its best evidence to the medical community and ask for their evaluation of all aspects of the alien abduction issue? If not, why not? Until that happens, 'little' magazines like The Anomalist will perform a useful function by providing a forum for the reasoned discussion of seemingly un- reasonable ideas including such non-ufological ones as: the 'Mars' Face, strange 'voices' heard over telephone wires, spontaneous human combustion, remote viewing and a new locale for the origin of the human race. Huyghe and Stacy, whose writings in Omni should be familiar to this journal's readers, have made an aus- picious beginning. They deserve commendation for the overall quality of the eclectic mix of anomalous mater- ial their new magazine provides the curious reader. George W.

I^is unknown what restrictions, if any, will be applied to Mack's future work. Neither Mack nor MacLeish was available for com- ment. In the past Mack has said he hoped the conflict with Harvard could be resolved quietly and amicably. Now, \"he's very relieved,\" a friend reported. \"He feels he and the dean had a useful exchange.\" The committee primarily concerned itself with the procedural details of Mack's work, according to two doctors who worked on the effort. \"One of the issues be- fore the committee was whether John was doing clinical care or research,\" one doctor said. \"If he was doing re- search on human subjects, he needed formal permission. He said it was clinical work.\" Committee chairman Relman said the board examined Mack's \"professional behavior as an academic psychiatrist and whether he was dealing with his patients in a suitable academic way.\" Contrary to published reports, Relman said the com- mittee never considered revoking Mack's tenure at Harvard. \"Harvard University isn't going to take ac- tion against someone who takes unorthodox views, and with whom it may disagree. John Mack may win the Nobel Prize and go down in history as the modern Galileo.\" 1995 UFO SYMPOSIUM PROCEEDINGS The MUFON 1995 International UFO Symposium Proceedings are now available by mail from MUFON in Seguin, Texas.

I knew Bill Vogel in the last year of his life and visited him at the Yakima Indian Reservation, where I listened to him for three days about paranormal events on the Reservation. At the same time, Dr. J. Allen Hynek was interested in doing work there, and we discussed events on the \"Res\" several times by phone. Sadly, both are no longer with us, and we are fortunate to learn from Greg Long what has been happening. (Access to the Reservation is very severely restricted by the Yakima Tribe.) But beyond this, I find that Long's report gives us a very serious clue to what may be truly going on with UFOs, Bigfoot, balls of light, poltergeists, and other phenomena, which may all be closely related. I find this very encouraging since my own experiences in in- vestigating UFO, Bigfoot, poltergeist and other para- normal events over the last 20 years, much of it in Washington and Oregon, jibe very closely with what Long reports. I, and others, have photographed objects around camp sites that were alive, but which we could not see. Some of us have encountered odd tracks in snow that started from nowhere, and terminated into nowhere. Other tracks started as animal tracks and mor- phed into human tracks. And the reverse. Some hu- manoid tracks (large and barefoot) changed into dog tracks. In sleeping near such places, dreams merged easily into reality. UFOs were reported seen near Bigfoot sightings, sometimes with Bigfoot entering them, sometimes leav- ing, sometimes just standing, watching the UFO. Families that would see UFOs would also see Bigfoot creatures, find balls of light wandering through their homes (cold, when grabbed), have a manic tearing and scratching at closed closet doors, which, when opened, had nothing inside, and no damage. In one event, wait- ing for an almost routine nightly Bigfoot contact at a home in Ohio, a group of us heard at exactly 9 pm, the usual time, the sound of a cat being torn into pieces, alive, and a thud against the back door. We opened the door — and found absolutely nothing, not a drop of blood. The list can go on — UFOs that morph into cars near Area 51, giant grey bees that chase investigators' cars off the road into the ditch, weird glowing balls of light that \"escort\" investigators' cars off the site, ab- ductions from the Rachel motel that go \"sideways\" to the exam room, instead of \"up.\" (Sideways as in through the mountain to the base, perhaps?) Where does this all lead? Given the diversity of UFO descriptions, with relatively few, such as the Iran UFOs, possibly some Gulf Breeze UFOs, and some Mexico City UFOs, being consistantly the same, it is highly possible in my view that each UFO seen could be di- rectly related to the viewer, and may be a mental force that may feed off the viewer's energy and thoughts. These UFOs then may change to animals, humans, balls of light, unseen entities in homes, Bigfoot creatures, lake monsters, columns of mist in crop circles fields (the few that are not faked), \"Mothman\" type entities, and a wide variety of paranormal phenomena such as what Greg Long describes. Thus, in a fair portion (but not all) of such cases, what we encounter may be part of ourselves, unrecog- nized, or something that changes shape and even style, to watch us, harass us, educate us, and mainly, to relate to us in a variety of forms. Such phenomena also could be from possible dead relatives, persons who once lived in certain homes or areas, or roving, mischievous, non- physical entities who enjoy upsetting us, and who are ba- sically saying: \"Look at me, I am here. I exist.\" This finding, this theory, does not mean that we need to abandon all studies of UFOs as craft, nor studies of aliens as real beings. It simply points out that in perhaps 50% of all cases, the combined phemonena may be psy- chically related, or related to alleged spirits who observe and interact with us. How else can we have a UFO that changes to a dog which changes to a Bigfoot which changes to a ball of light, which changes to an owl that becomes a fox when shot at, which becomes a different type of UFO, which becomes a knock on the walls with nobody there, which becomes something weird swimming in the lake, which becomes an odd guy wearing all black who is not Johnny Cash? Ideas to consider in research. — Erik Beckjord Curator, UFO Museum Los Angeles CONFERENCE ACCOUNT James Clarkson's account of our \"close encounter\" at the recent MUFON conference in Seattle provides insights into his competence as a \"criminal investigator.\" Clarkson \"forgot\" to inform readers that the official conference program gave only the following constraints: \"No videotaping or flash-cameras are permitted in the conference room.\" (Emphasis added.) During one ses- sion the first day, I did take several non-flash photos, and later Clarkson informed me that all photos were banned so I took no more. He did not mention any ban on audio recorders.

SEPTEMBER 1995 NUMBER 329 PAGE 21"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL Walter N.Webb October 1995 Bright Planets (Evening Sky): Venus (magnitude -3.9) requires a clear, unobstructed horizon in order to view it comfortably during evening twilight. The bright planet lies quite low in the WSW, setting only half an hour after the Sun in mid-October and nearly an hour after at month's end. Lining up beyond Venus in the SW are two more planets, first Mars (1.4) and then higher still, Jupiter (-1.9). Mars (don't confuse the red planet with nearby reddish Antares) moves from Libra into Ophiuchus this month. The ruddy world is closing on Jupiter and Antares. It sets in the WSW about 1-2 hours after sunset (midmonth). Jupiter, in Ophiuchus, sets about 8:30. The crescent Moon joins the gathering from October 25 through 27. Saturn (0.8), in Aquarius, can be seen in the SE at dusk, then moving westward in the S as the night progresses. The gas gi- ant's ring system appears thin and only slightly tilted, its N side being exposed to the Sun. Bright Planets (Morning Sky): Mercury is farthest W of the Sun on the 20th for its best morning appearance of the year. During the last half of October, this normally hard-to-see planet will be high enough above the E horizon to glimpse, especially with the help of binoculars. On the 22nd use the nearby crescent Moon to lo- cate Mercury 5° to the lower left. Saturn sets in the W about 4 AM in mid-October. Moon Phases: First quarter—October 1 Full moon—October 8 Last quarter^—October 16 New moon—October 24 First quarter—October 30 O C Penumbral Lunar Eclipse: On the 8th the full moon slips into the dim outer shadow of the Earth for early risers in Hawaii and Alaska—the former at 3:58 AM and the latter at 5:58. But the Moon either sets or the Sun rises before mid-eclipse when the slightly darkened Moon becomes really noticeable. Meteor Shower: The Orionids achieve their maximum on the morning of October 22, without any Moon interference. So about 20 to 25 meteors per hour should be counted prior to dawn. These meteors are swift and faint for the most part, but also display some bright, train-leaving fireballs—objects that leave behind glowing wakes persisting in the sky for a few seconds. The Stars: While the prominent Summer Triangle and Great Square of Pegasus ride high across the southern heavens, a region of in- conspicuous autumn star patterns known together as \"The Sea\" comes into view. Found in the S and SE during mide- vening hours, these include such mythological creatures of the ocean as Capricornus the Sea Goat (diaper-shaped), Piscis Austrinus the Southern Fish (Fomalhaut is its bright star), Aquarius the Water Bearer. Cetus the Sea Monster, and Pisces the Fish (V-shaped pattern between Cetus and Pegasus). September 7-10 — Thirteenth Brazilian UFO Congress to be held in Curitiba, P.R., Brazil.

In August 1987, the num- ber of pages was increased to 24 without an increase in the subscription price, although this was planned as a step to improve the quality of our magazine. The cover stock went from a light-weight yellow page to a heavier blue stock and in August 1989 a radical improvement was made to a high quality white glazed cover that you see today. This was accomplished without an increase in price to subscribers, but by the continuous growth of memberships, which has now leveled off at 5200 this summer. During the past year paper costs have skyrocketed and the U.S. Postal Service has raised mailing costs on both domestic and foreign copies. We are also paying the editor substantially more for his editorial services than we did in 1986, as well as other employees in- volved in the monthly mailing process. The Board of Directors authorized the member service \"Reader's Classifieds\" advertisements in the Journal starting with the August 1992 issue and limited it to one page only. Even though the checks for the ads are made payable to MUFON and are mailed to Dennis Stacy, these funds are paid to Mr. Stacy as additional compensation for his editorial services. The MUFON Board refrained from giving Dennis an annual raise this year, but did ap- prove an increase in the Reader's Classified cost for ads based upon greater circulation and value received. Anyone connected with the publishing business will recognize that the MUFON headquarters office has per- formed a monumental task over the past nine and one- half years by holding the annual membership fee to the existing levels. Where else can you find such a fantastic bargain? Economics dictate that a revision must take place. A study committee, composed of the MUFON Executive Committee, will make a proposal to the MU- FON Board of Directors in the near future recom- mending a revised rate structure for membership/sub- scription. In the meantime, a few economy measures will be taken in the headquarters office related to new mem- berships and the number of renewal notices enclosed within the Journal. We encourage members to renew when they receive the first notice for renewal and not wait for the dreaded \"Expired\" warning, since the latter will be discontinued. We pride ourselves for having published the finest monthly UFO magazine in the world and expect to continue to do so with your tinued support. FORUM - Continued from Page 20 many hours to transcribe. But I had my audio recorder in hand in case he reported any important new develop- ments in the Roswell case. After Clarkson violated the conference ban by having a flash photo taken of my dozing, he shook my arm causing me to drop my tape recorder and when I picked it up its red light was on. I departed the conference hall, expecting Clarkson would follow so he could listen to the tape to examine the hard evidence. But he opted not to do so. Clarkson falsely alleges that I \"attended the Seattle Symposium on behalf of [my] CSICOP brethern and their silent Federal partners.\" If Clarkson had bothered to ask, I would have told him that I was there as a mem- ber of the press to gather information for use in my Skeptics UFO Newsletter (SUN), and I had no plans to write anything for CSICOP. Furthermore, that all of my travel expenses were being paid out of my own pocket. How ironic that MUFON, whose members accuse others of \"cover-up,\" attempts to muzzle members of the Press by denying them the right to tape record a speaker's remarks at MUFON's public conferences. CSICOP does not impose such constraints. Nor does the Defense Dept., the CIA, or any other government agency, to my knowledge. —Philip J.

FIELD INVESTIGATOR'S EXAM Many of you have vigorously studied the Field Investigator's Manual, attended field investigator's train- ing classes in your home locale and have taken the one- hundred multiple question exam. After following the in- structions to send the exam answer sheet to Shirley (Coyne) Tafoya in Flushing, MI, you have been eagerly awaiting a reply for several months from Shirley, to no avail. This is a serious problem, because like your- selves, I have not been receiving a confirmation report from Shirley on the exam grades in order to process members to the status of \"Field Investigator.\" This fail- ure to complete the grading loop is not only personally discouraging but very disappointing. This matter was on the agenda at MUFON's Annual Board of Directors' Meeting in Seattle, WA on July 9th. Until a new Director of Field Investigator Training is elected, all answer sheets for the field investigator's examination should be sent to Walt Andrus in Seguin, TX for grading. If you made a copy of your answer sheet, please send it to Walt. If not, please review the exam again and make a new answer sheet which you may submit or request a blank answer sheet from MU- FON in Seguin. Please be sure that your name and ad- dress is on the answer sheet. It is imperative that proper recognition be given to the people who have passed the exam so they may exercise this knowledge in UFO cases under investigation. May I express my apologies for these unwarranted delays. One of our directors vol- unteered to grade the tests as a result of our annual board meeting. NEW OFFICER Helmut Lammer, M.S. (Buck/Mur) has been appointed the Representative for Austria and a Research Specialist in Geophysics at the recommendation of Illobrand von Ludwiger, Director for MUFON-CES. Herr Lammer joined MUFON in January 1992 and was a speaker at O    o the BUFORA 8th International UFO Congress in Sheffield, England. Texas State Director Ellen R. Stuart selected Gayle Nesom, M.A. (Houston) to become her Assistant State Director for Southeast Texas, replacing Andy Abercrombie. Bill and Linda Murphy, Co-State Directors for Michigan, promoted hypnotherapist David E. Toth, Ph.D., (Holt) to State Section Director for Ingham, Eaton, Clinton, and Jackson Counties. NEW CONSULTANTS AND RESEARCH SPECIALISTS New Consultants joining MUFON this month were Thomas W. Martin, Ph.D. (San Diego, CA) in Clinical Therapy; David H. Robinson, Ph.D. (Vista, CA) in Mathematics; and Robert E. Cason. Ph.D. and J.D. (El Paso, TX) in English. Five new Research Specialists volunteered their expertise. They were Joseph J. Poveromo, M.S. (Brooklyn, NY) in Electrical Engineering and Physics: Lora L. Seaboldt, M.S. (Great Falls, MT) in Library Science; Victor C. Connor. M.S. (Normal. IL) in Electrical and Computer Engineering; Bob Canino, M.A. (Liverpool, NY) in Philosophy; and James R. Murray, M.S. (Tullahoma, TN)in Biology. COALITION REORGANIZED FOR SECOND YEAR The Mutual UFO Network (MUFON) joined with the Center for UFO Studies (CUFOS) and the Fund for UFO Research (FUFOR) last year in a coalition to solicit research proposals. The members of the coalition coun- cil met quarterly in Las Vegas. NV to pass judgment on proposals submitted and then funded worthy projects with monetary grants. The objective of all three groups was, and still is, to move the study of UFOs more to- ward science using the general protocols of the scientific method. Regretfully, the monetary benefactor behind the coali- tion became impatient with the scientific method, even though several important projects were completed or nearing completion. Due to a serious disagreement in management philosophy the coalition is no longer being funded by the Bigelow Foundation. We commend and thank Mr. Bigelow for his philanthropy during the first year of operation of the G-F-M Coalition. It was a no- table and enlightening experiment. The united front and scientific goals of the coalition will be continued but un- der more modest financial arrangements. We are presently negotiating with other philanthropists who are interested in resolving the UFO enigma in a scientific manner. Continued on Page 23 PAGE 24 NUMBER 329 SEPTEMBER 1995"}]
