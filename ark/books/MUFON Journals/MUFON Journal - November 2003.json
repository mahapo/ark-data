Budinger Analytical Chemist Frontier Analysis, Ltd. I t was dark in Delphos, KS, at 7 PM on Nov. 2, 1971. There was a full moon domi- nating the clear sky. The air was cool with a gentle westerly breeze. Sixteen-year-old Ron Johnson, ac- companied by his dog, Snowball, was about 250 feet from the house tending to the sheep. Ron's parents (Durel and Erma) were in the house, and his mother had just called him in to dinner. . Such was the stage for the one of the most extraordinary events in the history of ufology.' Immediately after the dinner call, Ron heard a sound like \"an old washing ma- chine which vibrates.\" He emerged from a shed and observed a mushroom-shaped object approximately eight feet in diam- eter with a mass of multicolored (blue, red, orange) light covering its entire sur- face. The glow bothered Ron's eyes when he looked directly at it. The object, about 25 yards away, was hovering two to five feet off the ground, and seemed to be depositing a shimmer- ing material. It remained for several min- utes, then the glow at the base of the object brightened and enlarged, and the object departed, accompanied by a high- pitched sound similar to a jet aircraft. At this point Ron was blinded for sev- eral minutes. On regaining his sight he saw the object departing to the south. Frightened, he went to get his parents, and when they came outside, all three witnessed the departing object in the sky. At this time it was half the apparent diam- eter of the full moon and the color of an arc-welder. The light was brighter than an auto headlight at 100 feet. The witnesses returned to the site where the UFO hovered and saw \"a glow- ing ring on the ground\" and lumines- cence on nearby trees. Ron's parents, Erma and Durel Johnson, touched the ring and noted the soil was not warm, and felt as if it had been crystallized. They also experienced a numbing ef- fect to their hands. Erma rubbed her hand against her leg, and it also became numb. The numb area in her leg has persisted until recent times (as of 1998). She also noted an unfamiliar odor. She returned to the house for a Polaroid camera. She had one picture left, and took a photo of the ring, reportedly with no flash, using film with an ASA rating of 75 [a very slow film]. Other witnesses arriving a day later reported a light-colored and doughnut/ horseshoe-shaped ring area about eight feet across. The ring itself was about one foot wide, and it was dry. The soil out- side the ring and in the middle, however, was muddy, due to recent rains. A high concentration of a white sub- stance was observed in all of the ring soil, but was not present in the surrounding soil. A foul odor was also reported by some investigators^ The investigation The first UFO investigator, Ted Phillips, arrived at the scene 32 days later on Dec. 4,1971. He reported the ring was still there, \"perfectly outlined in the unmelted snow.\" The soil underneath was dry to a depth of at least one foot, and was light brown in color; furthermore, it would not permit water to pass though the surface. However, the snow from the surround- ing area was melting, and that soil was black and moist. Additionally, a high concentration of white substance was observed in all of the ring soil, but not present in the surrounding soil. Phillips took numerous samples, inside of the ring, within the ring, along the re- ported exit path of the object, and out- side these areas as controls. He also took several photos and made numerous mea- surements. Phillips' next visit to the site was Jan. 11,1972, and this was followed by a num- ber of other visits over the years. On a visit 31/2 years later, Phillips noted that nothing grew on the ring. During each of his visits he sought to locate anything which would indicate a hoax, and found nothing, and the reputa- tion of the Johnson family indicated no likelihood of a hoax.. In addition to the reports by the wit- nesses and the physical aspects of the ring itself, there were also indications of animal rections to the sighting and the site. Previous soil analyses Most of the past analyses done on the ring soil focused on physical proper- ties, applied physical forces, and elemen- tal analysis. Unusual hydrophobic effects were noted. Compared to control soils it was noted that the ring soils contained a higher acid content, more soluble salts, and higher calcium content. They also produced less seed growth and were coated with an organic material. A second unusual material with white, crystal-like fibers was noted to be embed- ded in the ring soils. Very limited progress had been made into the molecular characterization of the white fibers and the other release materi- als. 2 ' 3 To my knowledge, none of the ana- lytical data were examined by an analyti- cal chemist with specialization in the iden- tifications of unknowns and an in-depth knowledge and experience in correlating data .from numerous, different tests to define the substance. It would appear that as each different test was done, the investigator arrived at a different opinion. A few conclusions were erroneous. It is reminiscent of the proverbial six blind men from Indostan who each attempted to describe an el- ephant based on the area of the animal he touched. Some effort had been made to eluci- date the molecular composition of the re- lease material. But, as noted above, a detailed compositional identification had not been achieved. In my viewpoint, both skill and experience were needed in data acquisition and interpretation of el- emental analysis, and especially molecu- lar spectroscopy, to put the puzzle to- gether. The specific key was a spectroscopist experienced in infrared and nuclear mag- netic resonance techniques. I hoped to apply the skills and experience of analyti- cal problem solving gathered over three decades to the solution of this problem. I did not have to start entirely from the beginning. Erol Faruk had done some very revealing initial analyses in the 1970s. Faruk developed his.analytical approach based on his experience as an organic chemist. He analyzed these materials us- ing 1970's technology, which has ad- vanced dramatically in the past 25 years. November 2003 MUFON UFO Journal Page 3"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Although computerization, new tech- niques, and instrumentation have ad- vanced the field of analytical sciences to previously unachievable heights, Faruk's work was outstanding and provided pre- liminary observations and conjectures re- garding unknown residues extracted from the ring soils. 4 ' 5 This was a definite asset in determin- ing the analytical approach to use in this analysis. Although my approach to the analysis, as an analytical chemist, is dif- ferent, there is nothing to contradict Faruk's initial observations. Samples I began communicating with Ted Phillips in 1998 regarding additional analy- sis on the Delphos ring soils. The prob- lem was to find existing samples. At a local Ohio MUFON meeting I related the quest to John Timmerman of CUFOS. After a search, he did manage to locate ring and control soil samples on Thanks- giving Day, 1998, and I received these on Dec. 7. Documentation and sample labeling existed, attesting to their authenticity, and they were encased in their original tightly closed Kodak film containers with black tops and showing no signs of tampering. The labeling on the soil samples left no doubt that they were sampled by Ted Phillips, the principal investigator, on Jan. 11,1972, which was two months after the event. Furthermore, they were in a box in which torn up pieces of a 1971 edition of a Missouri road map, Phillips' home state, was used for packing. Additionally, Phillips remembered sampling them. 6 Six Delphos soil samples were re- ceived. Their identifications follow: •Ring Sample A-2, Surface to 'A inch (15.1 g) •Ring Sample C-3, Surface to Vi inch (15.9 g) •Ring Sample D-3 Surface to 'A inch (14.0 g) •Control Sample Center Surface to 1/2 inch (23.1 g) •Control Sample A-9, Surface to '/2 inch (21.4g) •Control Sample C-8, Surface to '/2 inch (23.7 g) Analytical procedure The ring soils and control soils were analyzed using a battery of tests which included most of the analytical \"alpha- bet.\" The tests were used to examine the samples \"as received,\" as well as aque- ous and organic solvent extracts. These include the following: EDX (En- ergy Dispersive X-ray) elemental analy- sis; %C, %H, %N; XPS (X-ray Photoelec- tron Spectroscopy); XRD (X-ray Diffrac- tion); FT-IR (Fourier Transform - Infra- Verification of Ron Johnson's report The \"Wolf Girl\" of Delphos One of the incidents which debunkers have used to discredit the main witness in the Delphos case, Ron Johnson, is his statement that he had later seen a strange \"wolf-girl\" with wild blond hair, wearing a torn cloth coat, who escaped him by running away on all fours when he got close. But not reported by the debunkers is the fact that two and a half years after the Delphos UFO incident at least four people had observed what they also de- scribed as a \"wolf girl.\" In July, 1974, witnesses reported see- ing what appeared to be a female child of about ten or twelve years old, with mat- ted blonde hair running through a wooded area on the northwest edge of Delphos. She was dressed in tattered red clothing. One witness who encountered the girl during a search for her reported that the girl did not speak, but growled at him be- fore running off. Children had reported seeing the girl eating out of cat and dog dishes. Another witness reported that the strange \"wolf-girl,\" again described as having wild blond hair and wearing a torn cloth coat, escaped him by running away on all fours when he got close. About 7:30 AM on July 22, Mrs. Joe Stout saw the child on a vacant and over- grown lot sitting on a picnic table only five or six feet away. Mrs. Stout said she could not be sure if it was a boy or a girl, but assumed it was a girl because the child was wearing a red dress. The girl reportedly made an odd gur- gling sound when Mrs. Stout tried to get closer, and then jumped down from the picnic table and disappeared through a small hole in a nearby wall. Mrs. Stout said the child was definitely human and not deformed, although it ran on all fours. She estimated that the child, who had a curved scar from her right eye to her mouth, was only the size of a six- year-old. Mrs. Stout said she saw the child again around 4 PM and about 8:30 PM the same day. During a later night search of the area, Mrs. Stout was reportedly scratched on the shoulder, and a teenage neighbor, Kevin Marsh, was reportedly scratched on the throat from behind. Both said they got only a glimpse of what appeared to be a small assailant. Other residents of the area had re- ported chasing the girl through milo fields, but a posse organized by Ottawa County Sheriff Leonard Simpson found no trace of the girl, nor any evidence that she had been in the area. The girl was later reported by a resi- dent to be inside a shed, but officers and about 35 residents surrounding the shed found no trace of her. Although Sheriff Simpson acknowl- edged that people had seen something, he suggested that the reports could have been caused by cats and dogs running loose in the area. He pointed out that no children had been reported missing any- where in Kansas, and closed the case. Even so, parents of young children told The Wichita Eagle that they were keeping their children indoors or within sight. Sheriff Simpson said that most people who thought they saw something had changed their story by the next day when asked to give statements, but the Stouts, Marsh, and teenager Doug Kaiser con- tinued to insist that they had seen a little girl. Mrs. Stout said objects in a shed, in- cluding dolls from a collection that had been stored in barrels along with some clothing, had been moved during the night, although she didn't see or hear anyone near the shed. And when she had first seen the child she had noticed that someone had lined the dolls up on the picnic table and cov- ered them with pieces of cloth. There were no additional reports of the wolf girl (\"Search For 'Wolf Girl' Unsuccess- ful,\" Kansas City Times, 29 July, 1974. \"Delphos Folks divided By Reports of Wild Girl,\" Wichita Eagle, 3} July, 1974.) red) analysis; SEM/EDX (Scanning Elec- tron Mocroscopy/Energy Dispersive X- ray); headspace GC/MS (Gas Chromatog- raphy/Mass Spectroscopy); 'H NMR (Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance); 1C (Ion Chromatography); UV (Ultravio- let Spectroscopy). A few of the above tests had been done by other laborato- ries in the past. They were repeated in order to: 1.) obtain the data from state-of-the- art instrumentation; 2.) to compare to the previous data. A few instruments used in this study were not available when past analyses were done.

I concur with Faruk in that the substances were deposited in an aqueous solution. A humic substance coats the soil's surface, imparting the hydrophobic \"ef- fect\" which was noted 30 years ago. The white fibrous-appearing material that has eluded identification by investigators in the past is definitely identified as calcium oxalate. Non-volatile ring soil compo- nents calculate to approximately 2-3 wt.%. The following table lists these compo- nents and provides a rough estimate of their amounts. Found Ring Soil Substances (Non-Volatiles) Wt. % •Humic Substance 85 ±10 (Probably low molecular weight Fulvic Acid) •Calcium Oxalate  5 ±2 •Calcium Carbonate  —1 •Phosphate  <0.1 •Sulfate  <0.1 •Sulfide and/or Mercaptan <0.01 Conclusions 1.) The soils analyzed were sampled two months after the event, and 27 years have passed since the samples were col- lected, so it is unknown if any changes have occurred to the samples over this period of time. However, I believe that there is no evi- dence for extensive degradation, because past analytical test results from the ring soils compare closely to those tests that were repeated in this current analysis. The ring soils also retain the same hydro- phobicity as reported in the past. 2.) The humic substance specifically appears to be fulvic acid. It has proper- ties resembling a mull-type humus which occurs under conditions of high biologi- cal activities, such as under grass veg- etation and soils under cultivation. This material coats the soil surface, initially imparting a hydrophobic effect. Upon water addition to the ring soil, fol- lowed by agitation, it solubulizes, and the soil readily loses its apparent hydropho- bic effect. 3.) Both calcium oxalate and oxalic acid are known skin and eye irritants and would account for the physical effects suffered by the witnesses. It is suspected that the calcium oxalate found in the ring Jjly ORIGINAL POSITION V | OF FALLEN FLIGHT PATH ^r hi SHED The object and apparent flight path, as reconstructed by Phillips. soil was deposited as free oxalic acid and combined with calcium in the ground. 4.) The source of the chemilumines- cence (glow) still remains speculative. Faruk reports that he isolated a compound which he deduced was the source of this effect. The present study, did not detect this material. It may well have deterio- rated over time. If indeed present, it probably was in very minor amounts, i.e. not a major com- ponent of the release. My experience with compounds which impart color to materi- als, and materials that cause chemilumi- nescence, is that they usually need only to be present at a few ppm to be visually apparent. I can also offer this speculation. Hu- mic substances in the presence of oxalate derivatives and a suitable catalyst, e.g. hydrogen peroxide, may possibly cause the chemiluminescence effect. Hydrogen peroxide would have decomposed within hours of the event. 5.) The presence of sulfide/mercaptan could explain any obnoxious odor which purportedly emanated from the ring soils. 6.) The analysis shows the ring soil was not exposed to a physical effect, such as high temperature, which substantiates the statement of the principal witness. 7.) The analysis neither proves nor rules out a UFO source of the release. The above natural products have many useful properties. Specifically, humates are known for their chelation/bonding to metals and organics. They are used in fertilizer and for removal of toxic metals and organic pollutants. It is natural to assume \"other\" intelli- gent life forms would also use them. One speculation is they are perhaps waste products of a biological process. 8.) A speculation is offered by a col- league, Dr. J. Robert Mooney. This is based on the presence of the high con- centration (5%) of oxalic acid, which is a natural product in the soil, but such a high concentration would not be expected from the usual plant source. Exhaust from a low-temperature ion- ization or combustion engine (whose fuel source was elemental carbon) could leave a high concentration of the acid along with other lower molecular weight acids. Of course the major components from such an engine would be expected to be carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide. These would be lost as gases. The acids would concentrate in the soil beneath the exhaust. Use of elemen- tal carbon, as a fuel, seems very reason- able, as it is safely transportable and con- tains a high energy density. 9.) Finally, others have countered that the release represents the products of \"well seasoned barnyard soil.\" If this were the case, there should be much higher concentrations of such elements as nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium. Also, there should be evidence of sig- nificant amounts of other components, such as urea, uric acid, and ammonium components, which are typical of animal waste and its decomposition products, and these are not detected. Only the fulvic acid predominates. [Editor's Note: Debunker Phil Klass had suggested that the ring was from a circular stock feeder. Mrs. Johnson and the previous owner of the farm state that there has never been a feeder in that area.] Recommendations This analysis should serve as a base for analysis of similar events that may November 2003 MUFON UFO Journal PageS"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"occur in the future, or perhaps have al- ready occurred. Most notably, spectro- scopic analysis is needed. I am aware of two past events which would be worthy of a similar analytical approach. One such event occurred in Trans-en-Provence, France, on Jan. 8, 1981. Some of the analytical data from the soils suggest molecular compounds similar to Delphos could be present there. The other event occurred in Oregon in an area noted for high UFO activity. Beginning in the mid-1990's recurring white rings have been appearing in a plowed field. The white material has been identified as calcium oxalate. 9 It is recommended that future ring sites be carefully assayed for oxalic acid and other low molecular weight acetic type components. The following procedure is suggested. Perform an acid extraction, followed by ion chromatography. Quantitatively, this would yield very accurate amounts of the acids. Acids should then be examined by isotope mass spectrometry to deter- mine the carbon-14 level. Natural product sources of these ac- ids will give the expected values of 15.3 disintegrations/min/gm. A higher level of carbon-14 indicates the source was nonterrestrial. Lower levels indicate the source is not of recent biological origin or is not terrestrial.

Event Location: Puyallup, WA Date Occurred: June 8,2003 Dates Investigated: June 17,2003 WUFODCase: I..2-600-WA Background On Sunday, June 8, 2003 in the late afternoon (5 PM) a married couple was enjoying a pleasant sunny afternoon in their back yard at their home in Puyallup, WA (about 40 miles south of downtown Seattle). The husband was painting their hot tub, and his wife was bird watching using binoculars. She was watching a hawk through her binoculars when she noticed a silvery ob- ject that appeared to be hovering. The object appeared to have a shiny metallic center with a white haze around it. The wife told her husband about the sighting and he looked through the binoculars to view the object. It took the husband about 30 seconds to find the object with binoculars, and the object was too small to see with the naked eye. The husband ran upstairs to grab another set of binoculars, and his wife was unable to again find the object with her binoculars. Once the husband returned, it took him about 30 seconds to find the object. He said that it continued to hover and then began moving northward. He said that it then sped off rapidly and disappeared from his field of view in about 4 or 5 sec- onds. The total time of the sighting was estimated at about 10 minutes. He also stated that it was difficult to steady the binoculars enough to keep the object in view. The witnesses thought that this object was unusual because it hovered, began moving, and then moved rapidly. Initially they thought that it could be a balloon, but ruled that out when it be- gan moving rapidly. They also thought that it could be a very bright star, but knew that stars were not visible during the day. (The only celestial object visible during the day besides the moon is the planet Venus. However, I have eliminated Ve- nus as a cause of the sighting. See de- tails in the results section below.) For these reasons the witnesses thought this object to be quite unusual and reported the sighting to the MUFON report database. I obtained permission from the West- ern Washington MUFON director (Kathleen Anderson) to investigate the report. Radar data The first task was to collect data. I immediately put in a request for radar data to the local Federal Aviation Administra- tion (FAA) office. I requested all radar data from 4:45 pm to 5:15 pm within 30 miles of the witness's home in Puyallup, WA. (The FAA recycles radar tapes ev- ery two weeks, so requests have to be made immediately.) I only requested \"pri- mary\" and not transponder returns. Meteorological data I next collected all pertinent meteoro- logical data for the time period of the sighting, including surface reports, up- per air reports, and reports from a wind profiler which is located at the National Weather Service Office in Sandpoint, WA. The profiler is located a few miles north of downtown Seattle. Wind profilers mea- sure winds in the lower part of the atmo- sphere at various levels. This profiler uses Doppler and acoustical technology to measure temperatures and winds. I also checked into the times of all weather balloon launches. Other sightings I checked other UFO reporting data- bases to see if there were other UFO sightings in the area. This investigation showed that no other sightings were re- ported in the immediate area. According to the National UFO Re- porting Center (NUFORC) web site, a video camera picked up some anomalous objects at 7:30 AM on June 9,2003, near Vancouver, B.C. Canada. NUFORC thought that this sighting was due to birds in a distance. Also on the next day several rapidly moving disk-shaped objects were sighted in the Kansas City area. (One sighting was in Lenexa, KS, at 12:35 PM and the other at Lee's Summit, MO, at 11:30 AM.) Another daytime sighting was made in Avondale, AZ, on June 9,2003, at 19:30 local time. The characteristics of this sighting are very similar to the sighting in Page 6 MUFON UFO Journal November 2003"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"Puyallup. The object moved towards the northeast, was silver in color, and was very distant. Celestial objects checked To ascertain the position and bright- ness of the planets on the date of the sighting, I checked the night sky section of the May MUFON Journal. (The posi- tions and brightness of celestial objects for June were listed in the May issue of the Journal.) I contacted the witnesses and made an appointment for Sunday, June 15. This was exactly one week after the sighting. I interviewed both witnesses, took some photos, and made some angular measure- ments with a pocket transit. GPS reading A global positioning system (GPS) reading was taken to determine the lati- tude and longitude of the location where the sighting was made. I also verified the time period of the sighting and elevation and azimuth readings of the initial and final points of observation. I used a pocket transit mounted on a tripod to obtain these readings. The witness was confident in the an- gular measurements because he had a point of reference for each reading (e.g. edge of roof of neighbor's house). Both witnesses were very cooperative and reliable. The initial report entered in the MUFON database provided most of the details. I only had to have each wit- ness clarify a few details. Maps compiled Maps were compiled based upon the data collected above. Plots of the radar echoes were made for the time period of the sighting. A map'showing the only known balloon launch in the area was made. Balloon launchings checked The National Weather Service per- formed a routine balloon launch at 5 PM P.D.T. Balloons are launched twice a day at 5 AM P.D.T and 5 PM P.D.T. Balloons are launched at fixed locations through- out the world at 0000 and 1200 Greenwich Meridian Time. This is the same time that the witnesses saw the object. However, that balloon was launched at Quillayute, WA, 117 miles to the west- northwest of where the witnesses ob- served the object. Therefore we can rule out this weather balloon as a cause of the sighting. A check was made with the local air pollution agency to see if any balloons were launched in the Seattle area on June 8, 2003. I learned that the agency no longer launches balloons and relies in- stead on the wind profiler to obtain tem- perature and wind readings in the lower atmosphere. - Could other types of balloons cause this type of sighting? Hot air balloons are quite doubtful because one would see \"flashing\" when bursts of hot air are pe- riodically made to keep the balloon buoy- ant. On the basis of the wind direction aloft one could eliminate balloons from this sighting. Both the local wind profiler and upper air sounding show that winds aloft shifted from the southwest at the surface to the west or northwest at about 3000 feet. The witness initially saw the object at an elevation of 57 degrees (based on the transit reading). Even if the object were only one mile away the altitude would have been nearly 4,500 feet, which would mean that the object should be traveling towards the southeast if it was a balloon. (The distance of the object was likely much farther than one mile.) However, the witnesses stated that the object hovered for a time and then moved towards the north. For this reason the sighting could not have been a balloon. Blimps would be another possibility, but the shape and aerial movements noted by the witnesses would rule this out. The planet Venus is sometimes visible during the day. (It could possibly be sighted through binoculars if it was bright.) However, a check of the \"Night Sky\" section of the MUFON Journal shows that Venus rose at 4 AM in June, 2003. Therefore the planet would have ei- ther been setting at that time or would be near the western horizon. The planet would have not been in the field of view of the witnesses. The movement of the object would also rule out Venus. Autokinesis? Sometimes a process called \"autoki- nesis\" can make an object appear to have movement when stared at over time. This is described in the MUFON Field Investigator's Manual. However, the wit- nesses saw the object as stationary, and then noted movement after several min- utes. This is likely not autokinesis be- cause an object will appear to \"jump\" and move around intermittently. A conventional aircraft? Could the object have been a conven- tional aircraft seen at a large distance (thus the appearance of hovering)? The witnesses both stated that no aircraft were in the area during the 10-minute time period when they saw the object. The object under the 7X magnification of binoculars was still only the size of a small star. The fact that the object was not visible to the human eye probably explains why no one else saw the object in the area. A look at the radar data shows several echoes in the area where-and when the witnesses saw the object. However, the only radar echo in the field of view of the sighting, at the time of the sighting, and in the direction of the sighting was 23 miles from the witnesses (horizontal). When you consider the large angle of elevation (57 degrees), the object would have been 42 miles away from the wit- nesses. (Of course this would be assum- ing that the radar echo was the object.) Whatever caused this radar return only produced one echo. Therefore no esti- mate of velocity could be made. However, if the object was actually hovering, as described by the witnesses, radar may not pick it up, depending upon how the moving target indicator (MTI) was adjusted on the radar. The MTI is used to eliminate \"radar clutter\" and there- fore results in the radar only picking up moving targets. Also radar will not pick up all objects. The radar beam is set from ground to in- finity. However, this does not mean that radar will pick up all moving targets from the ground through the upper atmo- sphere. My experience has shown that FAA radar picks up aircraft flying at cer- tain altitudes (probably altitudes close to the center of the beam). The altitude of the center of the beam will vary depending upon how close the target is to the radar. At farther targets, radar will pick up higher-fly ing aircraft, while at closer targets lower-flying aircraft will be picked up. The witness location was about 50 miles to the southeast of the Fort Lawton radar antenna. (Data from the FAA Fort Lawton radar were used in this analysis.) When reviewing the radar data, I did notice one anomaly. The anomaly in- volved radar possibly indicating a rap- idly moving target. The radar showed that an object was moving towards the south at 2,100 mph. Radar can be a reli- able tool for estimating speeds of objects, but in the absence of eyewitnesses the reliability decreases. The cause of this \"runner echo\" is likely due to the fact that an object was out of the field of view of the radar and was a more distant object. The radar would have painted the object at an erro- neous position (too close) on the next turn of the antenna. This anomaly is dis- cussed in the MUFON Field Investigator s Manual. This object would have been out of the field of view of the witnesses. The November 2003 MUFON UFO Journal"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"witnesses' field of view was restricted to the right of the 60-degree arrow due to a neighbor's house. In other words the witnesses could only see from about east- northeast to north from their location. Calculating speed We can make some deductions about the speed of the object at various dis- tances because we know that the object traversed 32 degrees of arc in about 10 minutes. (The movement wasn't con- stant, but we can still use an average movement.) Distance (Miles) 1 5 10 15 20 23 42 Average speed (M PH) 3 17 34 50 67 77 141 Speeds at distances of 23 and 42 miles were used respectively because 23 miles was the horizontal distance to the radar echo, and 42 miles was the distance to the echo considering the elevation angle of 57 degrees. Based on the above table, if this ob- ject was an aircraft, it would have likely been at least 25 miles from the witnesses per speed estimate. (Of course this would only apply to light aircraft or helicopters.) Based on the silvery appearance, it is quite unlikely that the aircraft was a heli- copter or light aircraft. Most helicopters and light aircraft are color painted. Many military and commercial jets are silver in appearance, especially at large distances. (This could be due to the sun reflecting off of the wings.) However, in this case, due to the average slow speed, it is highly unlikely that this craft was a commercial or military jet. Conventional aircraft can also be ruled out based on the appearance, shape, ini- tial hovering, eventual slow speeds, and the ultimate rapid acceleration reported by the witnesses. Calculating altitude We can also make some deductions about the altitude of the object based on the elevation angle. Distance (Miles) Altitude (Feet) (at 57 Degree Elevation) 1  4,428 5  22,140 10  44,282 15  66,422 20  88,563 23  101,848 42  185,984 If we look at both tables above, we can almost eliminate light aircraft and he- licopters as the cause of this sighting. We established that the craft would have to be at least 25 miles from the witnesses to have been flying at the speed of a light aircraft. However, at 25 miles the craft would have been at an altitude of over 100,000 feet. I doubt seriously if Cessna or Beechcraft airplanes can fly over 100,000 feet. Determining distance Can we make any deductions about how far the craft was from the observers? Obviously if we had more witnesses at other locations we could do location es- timations through triangulation. We don't have that data in this case. We know that the object was not vis- ible to the naked eye. So it was either very small, very far away, or a combina- tion of both. The effects of weather We can look at weather observations for the day. Most weather stations in the area were reporting horizontal visibilities of 10 statute miles with no obstructions to visibility (e.g. haze, smoke, etc). The region had been under a hot spell for a few days before the sighting and some smog had resulted. However, on the day of the sighting the winds had shifted onshore, and at- mospheric mixing was adequate to dis- perse the smog. Also, these weather stations are auto- mated, and therefore visibility is taken with an instrument and not the human eye. Ten miles could mean 10+miles. On a clear day Mount Rainier is frequently visible from downtown Seattle. Mount Rainier is located close to 50 miles from downtown Seattle. The question then arises as to whether the observers could see an object more than 10 miles away, even with 7-power binoculars? I believe that the answer is yes, because they were looking up at 57 degrees initially, and 22 degrees above the horizon when the object was last sighted. Visibility is generally better when you look up at a steeper angle of the atmo- sphere because you are looking through less of the lower atmosphere. To ascertain whether the object was a conventional aircraft I asked the wit- nesses if they saw any contrails, heard any noise, or noticed any conventional aircraft in the area. The answer was no to all questions. A check of the humidity and tempera- ture profile from the atmospheric sound- ing showed that the humidity was too low at levels where contrails could form (be- low temperatures of -40 degrees Centi- grade). This can be interpreted such that contrails could have formed, but would have quickly evaporated in the dry air. Therefore, on this day the witnesses would have noticed at most a small con- trail behind the object if it were a conven- tional aircraft flying at high altitude (at or above 30,000 feet). The contrail would have rapidly disappeared due to unfavor- able conditions. Conclusions After considering all of the possibili- ties for this sighting, such as balloons, blimps, bright celestial bodies, atmo- spheric phenomena, and conventional aircraft, we can methodically eliminate each possibility. The weakest aspects of this sighting are that only two witnesses were in- volved, the witnesses were at the same location, the object was distant, and the object was very small. The reason other witnesses did not see the object is because it was not vis- ible to the human eye, and would not have been spotted at all had not one of the witnesses been bird watching through binoculars. Based on the above I classify this sighting as unidentified. If more data were available, the object was closer, or the object was larger, then a conventional explanation would be possible.

Vernon, IL, and involved three adult witnesses and one child. According to the principal witness, he and his wife and daughter, along with their friend, were attending July 4 festivi- ties at the park, at the southern end of the North Marcum Recreation Area. The witnesses were looking up in the direction of the lake dam to the south, along with an about 200 other people, an- ticipating the final sky dive jump of the day. As their attention was focused on the approaching plane used by the skydivers, they noticed two luminous white objects in the same general portion of the sky which seemed to be traveling together. They were round to elliptical in shape, and their apparent size was estimated to be similar to a golf ball at arm's length. Actual size was estimated to be 11 -30 feet. The objects reportedly moved in a straight line from the south/southwest to the north/northwest (and directly over- head) at a constant rate of speed that was estimated to be 500 mph The altitude of the objects was estimated to be 10,000 feet. No sound was heard, and the objects left no trails. The witnesses agreed that the objects were radiating an intense white light, rather than simply reflecting sunlight. The objects disappeared behind the trees on the northern horizon. Sight- ing duration was estimated to be 2-3 min- utes. Despite all the other people that were present, the witnesses stated that no one else seemed to have seen the objects, since the witnesses said they received strange looks from those immediately around them when they asked. Weather conditions included clear, sunny skies and wind speed averaging 9.5 mph out of the southwest. This roughly corresponds with the direction of the mystery objects. Area sheriffs' offices stated that no calls were received. A later effort to find park rangers«was also unproductive. Af- ter circling the entire lake, including ev- ery campsite, for more than two hours, a single park ranger was never found. An unsuccessful attempt was also made to contact the skydiving group that made the jump that day. Therefore, the report must stand on the sole testimony of the witness and his family. -•<£ Two North Dakota youths encounter landed UFO UFOs Are With Us—Take My Word by Leo Dworshak, 2003, Dorrance Pub- lishing, 701 Smithfield St., Third Floor, Pittsburgh, PA 15222 (1-800-788-7654), 6x9 soft cover, 71 pages, $8.00 + $3.99 S&H.

Reviewed by Dwight Connelly As the title suggests, this is an ac- count which relies on taking the word of the author that the events occurred, since no other evidence is presented. Given the topic of the book-contact with extra- terrestrials-this hardly meets the criteria for solid documentation. The only other witness to the contacts was Dworshak's younger brother, Mike, who died in the Korean War. As the au- thor points out, \"It is quite a thing that a person faces, being certain inside, yet un- able to prove it.\" Despite the lack of cor- roborating witnesses, this account some- how has the ring of truth. The author, now retired and 83 years old, reports that his first encounter with the entities occurred as a 12-year-old in 1932, not far from his farm home near Kill- deer, ND, while with his brother, who was only seven years old. This first sighting was of a strange object which was \"a huge, round thing, as big as our barn at least,\" in a valley about half a mile away. It was flattened somewhat, and \"rotating in a complicated way\" with \"flashing colored lights\" on an outer shell, \"like a band or belt that went completely around it at the widest point, and was turning one way.\" The inner shell, however, \"seemed to be standing still, or perhaps turning the other way. The colored lights came only from the rotating shell or belt.\" The ob- ject appeared to be totally silent, and there was no sign of smoke or exhaust. The two youngsters decided to move closer, but encountered what seemed to be an invisible force field which stopped them. As they observed the object, a seamless door opened, and individuals exited the object, looked at the sky, and reentered the object. The two youngsters were afraid of problems with their parents if they stayed longer, so they reluctantly left. They returned several times during the next few days, but did not see the object, and there was no sign that it had been there. However, two weeks after the first sighting, the youngsters saw the object move into the valley and land in the same area as before. Once again Leo and Mike were stopped by the invisible force field as they attempted to move closer. Six \"men\" emerged from the object, dressed in a different type of uniform than before. They seemed to be reaching down and taking something from the ground. Once again, the boys had to leave for home, despite their eagerness to stay and watch. The two brothers told their parents what they had seen, but received only indifferent responses. They also told a man who ran a grain elevator, since they considered him \"a man of the world\" who was always patient with them. He said he believed them, and that he had seen some sort of object flying through the air one rime. The boys were encouraged that at least someone believed them. Their ef- forts to interest playmates, however, were rebuffed. They felt that one reason for this was that they were Catholic German- Americans, which was not popular after the war with Germany. Determined to not only see the object again, but to also meet the crew and look inside, the boys again made almost daily trips to the site. Their persistence was rewarded when they again saw the object come in for a landing, this time only about 800 feet away. They waved and yelled, but were ignored by the \"men.\" The force field was still there, and the boys observed that it also worked against a jackrabbit, which bounced off of it. The object began to shake the ground, there was a slight hum, the outer shell began to rotate, and the object took off, retracting \"four prongs, which were maybe 4 feet by 8 feet.\" Colored lights flashed out, and when the object was about 10 or 15 feet above the ground, it simply vanished. Toward the end of August the boys again witnessed the object landing, but this time they were within a couple of hun- dred feet of it, and this time they could feel the force field surrounding them. They could not move their bodies, except November 2003 MUFON UFO Journal Page 9"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"to talk and breathe, and were \"scared and not scared.\" The author explains: \"Strangely, we felt we had somehow made them our friends, though we had never gotten closer than the length of a football field, and were still shook up and a bit nervous about them.\" After awhile, Leo told Mike that they needed to go home or they would be in trouble. Suddenly the force field disappeared, as though the \"men\" had heard the conver- sation. Three days later the brothers returned, get- ting within 30 or 40 feet of the object and the \"men\" before encoun- tering the force field. \"Discounting their clothing,\" says the au- thor, \"they looked very much like someone you might see walking in Bismarck,\" but all six of the occupants \"were all about the same build and the same size, between five and six feet tall, and all wore a similar light cover- all or jumpsuit,\" with no buttons, and shoes that were not separate from their trousers. The author notes that \"none of them looked very burly.\" Mike started jumping up and down to get the attention of the \"men,\" who then looked over at the two youngsters. Sud- denly the force field was again surround- ing Leo and Mike, but eventually the ob- ject took off, and the force field disap- peared. On their next trip to the site, the broth- ers again encountered the force field, but the \"men\" did raise their hands to ac- knowledge the youngsters. \"We felt they were definitely interested in us in a friendly way,\" says the author. But the \"men\" seemed very busy, \"coming and going from the ship with small parcels and odd gadgets we couldn't quite see. There could have been dozens of them inside, but we never saw more than six of them outside at one time.\" After the work seemed to die down, one of the \"men\" came over to within 10- 12 feet of the youngsters. \"He looked directly at us,\" says the author, \"and smiled in a peaceful and friendly way, rais- ing his hand with the open palm toward us.\" He then turned and entered the object. At home that evening, the author says he felt that \"the men from the spaceship were affecting me and Mike in some way I could not quite put my finger on.\" When the boys again told their mother about their experiences, she was much more open, saying, \"You've got me pretty well convinced that you are not just com- ing home with wild stories anymore. It has gone way beyond that point, because you have learned too many things. You talk about too many different things.\" On their next encounter they were able to walk up to the object without encountering the force field. The \"men\" were outside, apparently doing exer- cises, and \"made us feel welcome.\" The author says the \"men\" \"were so ordi- nary looking in one way, and so exotic in another....Their com- plexion was very light beige, resembling a good tan. Their eyes were blue with a dark .pupil....Their hands and feet were shaped like ours.\" Their uniforms \"were neatly pressed, but did not have badges or other insignia that might show rank, like our soldiers did... .Their smile was like ours, probably more gentle and relaxed than ours, maybe a more gentle smile than I have ever seen.\" Up close, the boys could see that the object was light blue \"that blended smoothly into the color of the sky.\" Mike, very excited, started talking to the men in a mixture of German and En- glish. A \"man\" came out of the object and said in German, \"I can speak your language.\" Then he said in English, \"We speak all the languages of all people on your planet.\" The \"man\" explained that \"we are from another galaxy. We have traveled to your planet for over 5,000 years. We are from a place far beyond your world by millions of years in time. We continue traveling to your planet because it is part of our responsbility.\" He said the boys should return home and rest \"because your minds are not big enough to learn everything as quickly as you would like. Remember, you must be- lieve what you have seen and understand what you have learned, and try to under- stand that we are not here to hurt any- one.\" The author says, \"I was now certain that they were far older than anyone we had ever met before....I also knew they deeply respected our Earth.. ..I was now fairly convinced that these travelers from the spaceship could definitely read our minds.\" On their next visit the boys noted that the object did not reflect light, but \"seemed to absorb the light around it and produce its own subtle light of any color or pattern of shades they wished, like the chameleon....One moment it would blend into the sunset, matching every color and pattern. Then it would go like oily water and abruptly change to a polished mirror or a dark, non-reflective surface like a hillside.\" Upon the arrival of the youngsters, one of the \"men\" said, \"These boys would like to touch our ship. Make sure it is well grounded, for we probably have developed some electricity in our trav- els.\" The author says the object was \"so smooth, and exchanged no heat with my hand. It was neither warm nor cold, and was definitely smoother than glass or polished metal, which will stick to your hand. It was like trying to press one mag- net against the same pole of another, like I was not really touching anything at all... .The ship was made in such a way, or of such a material, that once it rose sev- eral hundred feet in the air, it looked just like the sky... .1 remembered the times we watched the ship departing from the val- ley, how it rose in the air and then disap- peared. Had it flown off so quickly that we couldn't follow its movements, or had they just floated there and watched our behavior?\" Once again apparently reading the thoughts of the two boys, one of the \"men\" said they could enter the object, but would first have to \"go through a pro- cess\" to kill germs upon entering and leav- ing the object, which would involve the boys removing their clothing. By this time the boys felt very relaxed around the men. \"I am certain that hatred and violence are not a part of their be- havior,\" says the author. \"It does not seem to exist with them....They seemed to realize that our world was in trouble.. ..and gave us the impression that the people of our planet had somehow brought these troubles on themselves, and would have to solve these problems through their own efforts. They gave us the indication that man would soon bring terrible wars and suffering upon himself.\" He adds, \"It was mighty grim stuff for a couple of farm kids hoping for a look in- side a spaceship. As the years since have gone by, everything they told us has hap- pened, though sometimes with strange and .unexpected twists.\" Once inside the object, the boys dis- covered what appeared to be the main Page 10 MUFON UFO Journal November 2003"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"compartment, a food preparation area, fully automatic toilet facilities, sleeping compartments with unusual beds, and a lab or workshop area. \"Their meals and cooking are impos- sible to explain, although they were very nice about trying to explain it to us,\" says the author. In the main compartment were chairs which were individually adjustable, which puzzled the boys, since all the \"men\" seemed to be the same size and shape. More interesting to Mike was the abil- ity of the chairs to move under a person, no matter where that person chose to sit down. \"Mike had a great time trying to outwit the chairs,\" says the author, \"much to the great amusement of our friendly hosts.\" There was also what appeared to be a movie screen, about four feet by five feet, which \"was showing pictures of a place or process we could not fathom.\" Opposite the screen, along the wall, was a machine which was continuously operating. \"I would assume, at the present time, we would describe them as computers, although they explained that these machines were a magnetic sensor,\" says the author. \"Remember, this took place back in the year 1932.\" The boys were shown a magnetic la- ser beam which could stop a bird in mid- air or a rabbit jumping, holding the'ani- mals motionless for as long as they de- sired, without harming the animals. \"One of the reasons for their great in- telligence is their ability to use twelve senses,\" explains the author. \"I do not know why the number twelve figured into so many things they explained to us. All I can do is relate knowledge I sometimes do not fully understand.\" He explains that he \"learned that ours is one of 12 galaxies that are, in some way, tied together,...and they told us that twelve people from their galaxy live full time on our planet Earth. These people live among us, but we cannot tell that they are different from us. We were also in- formed that these twelve people have of-, ten offered to help pur world, and were rejected every time.\" Dworshak adds, \"It is important for us to understand that they said the Earth is their responsibility, rather than mankind. We only occupy a place they are trying to take care of... .They are connected with an advanced civilization or supreme be- ing that somehow exists beyond the twelve galaxies.\" The youngsters did not see the object or the visitors the rest of 1932, but the author says he saw it off and on later, \"and even saw it land several times....I did not make any more personal contact with the visitors. They never appeared during the winter when there were no in- sects or live plants.\" In August, 1936, however, he saw the object land near Dunn Center, ND, and was allowed to enter and talk with them. In 1938 he again saw the object land, this time near Watford City, ND, and again talked with the occupants. \"Each visit with them was like going home to a family that loved me,\" says the author. It was about 9:30 PM on Sept. 15,1939, when he saw them again, this time be- tween Sidney, MT, and Watford City, ND. The occupants were the same \"men\" as before, and one of them said, \"You have changed quite a bit since 1932.\" The author says he replied that they had not changed at all in the past seven years. \"We are several thousand years ahead of your time,\" answered one of the occupants. \"We are germ free, and our life expectancy is quite different from yours. At this time it would be impos- sible for us to explain to you how we have, accomplished all this in our lives.\" When the author left the object, about 11:30 PM, the occupants provided shadowless light all the way back to his auto. The author entered the Navy in 1941, and brother Mike, five years younger, enlisted in the Army for the last two years of the war. After the author's discharge from the Navy, he moved back to Kill- deer, occasionally spotting the object, but making no contact with the occupants. In 1946 he moved to Bozeman, MN, work- ing as a salesman. It was not until 1950 that he again saw the object land, this time between Norris and Sappington Junction, MN. This was the same year that Mike, who had made the military his career, was killed in Ko- rea. However, the object had landed far from the road, and the author did not make contact. In 1962, accompanied by his three daughters and two of their friends, he saw the object land. \"I was convinced this was the same spaceship I had seen back in 1932,\" says the author. \"I thought this might be the opportunity I, had longed for over the years-a chance to show the ship to the girls, so that others could con- firm my sighting.\" But it was not to be. \"It was very hard to contain my disappointment when I saw they were all frightened by the ship,\" says the author, \"there was no way to con- vince them no one would hurt us. We watched the ship for only about half an hour... .The girls had never seen anything like this before, and I hope they will never forget the experience. I am sure they have talked about it many times since.\" On Oct. 21,1963, the author again saw the object, and was welcomed by two of the occupants as he approached it. They entered the object and talked. One of the occupants said, \"Your science and tech- nology have advanced enough to pose a threat to our ships, as well as to the entire planet.\" Dworshak explains that \"man on Earth, in the last three years, had tried to learn how to detect and capture one of their ships.\" One of the \"men\" said, \"Although we have been seriously provoked, we will not treat man as he treats us, making un- provoked attacks which threaten our lives. If your military leaders continue their efforts to damage our ships, we will be forced to defend ourselves.\" The \"man\" explained, \"Our actions to protect and defend ourselves are .gov- erned by a simple principle: Anything that is thrown at us will be thrown back to its source. We are telling you this because, if it should ever happen, and I believe that one day it will, we want you to know we will do no more than protect our- selves.\" After more \"talking like old friends,\" the author left for a long walk to his car, with light again provided by the occu- pants. It was chilly, yet he felt a warmth as he walked. When he reached his car, he was surprised to find it running and the heater operating. Looking back on his experience with the entities over the years, Dworshak says, \"Think what an individual sacrifice these men make by leaving behind the benefits and conveniences of their world to spend years of their lives analyzing grasshoppers on our world. These great men willingly took the time to speak to two grubby little farm kids in North Da- kota, and changed our lives forever.\" There is, of course, much additional material in this book, including back- ground details and thought-provoking insights and discussions by the author.

On Sept. 25,2003, at 10:20 PM, I was walk- ing my dogs, and they started to pace and hide behind me, much like they do when there is a storm with lightning and thunder. Then almost exactly as it hap- pened before, the area above me turned pitch black. \"I mean it was as if the sky had been painted over. The area was huge from my vantage point, and there were no stars, no clouds, and no light of any kind. I could see a defined edge, but the shape changed from oblong to kidney shape and then to a distorted sphere of some kind. \"There was no noise of any kind, and the black shape moved at a pretty slow pace. It covered very little area in the five or so minutes that I could see it. I was determined to get a picture of it and I walked over to my car and grabbed the binocular/digital camera I bought myself a few weeks ago to snap pictures of the birds around my yard. \"I started snapping like mad and took at least 50 exposures. None of them ended up looking like anything except a shot of BLACK and nothing else. \"But tonight I saw it again, and this time it hung there in the sky for a good while. The creepy part of the whole thing was that last time I only saw it for a few moments, maybe half a minute, but this time not only did I see it on approach to where it stopped, but I saw it leave as well. \"It just picked up speed and within a few seconds it had risen into the night sky and I could see stars taking the place of the object as it rose, and then it was gone out of sight.

I found that George and I had many things in common. We had both fought in Vietnam, love antique cars, live near water, and have a passion for UFOs. When my wife and I arrived at his home I was impressed by his well kept home, two Corvettes, and an El Dorado Cadillac. He has a million gallon pond stocked with a wonderful assortment of huge fish. His VHS camera was filming UFOs fly- ing above a farm beyond his pond some 265 yards away. The UFOs are generally flying above the trees, and there were no wires to hang models from, eliminating most kinds of deceptions. He essentially was getting UFO move- ment while we were there. The RCA video camera was operating by itself with auto- matic focus and F settings. Additionally, the UFOs appeared to move so quickly that they would need to be shot out of a cannon. They were barely visible at 1/16 of a second, indicating they were probably moving at least a thousand miles an hour. My digital video camera did not record the UFOs. My wife and I did not see the UFOs, but when I drove to an open field behind the farm I had the feeling that the field had some type of activity, and UFOs were seen on the video. Reviewing some of the videos, it is apparent these craft have mastered a new form of propulsion that seems to have magnetic power properties. They make no noise and do not seem to disturb the trees or landscape. The craft appear to create a wave formation. Some of his video shots indicate that the UFOs are entering and leaving the field. Frankly they appear to go into the ground without slowing down. The vid- eos also appear to show the UFOs leav- ing the area at high speed. There could be some kind of artifacts within the cameras, but this seems very doubtful since four different camcorders have recorded the UFOs. Birds, planes, and insects are generally easy to identify in the videos. So what is going on? George speculated, \"The objects are there moving at very high speeds. They have the ability to penetrate a dirt field or barns. They almost seem to be operating in a different dimension, they seem out of phase or frequency with our reality.\" In the video you can hear us talking as a UFO flies over the silo. We did not see it. The large number of the UFOs filmed would indicate that it is unlikely these objects are coming from other star systems. They seem to coexist with us in a different dimension. As you read this column, radio, televi- sion, telephone, and radar, signals are passing through your home. Unless you have the proper equipment you cannot see, measure, or feel them. It is possible that a dimension, otherworld, frequency or other reality ex- ists that so far we are unable to measure and occasionally, we see evidnce that this is the case. We have hundreds of reports each month of UFOs, strange beings who can walk through walls, cattle mutilations, crop circles, and other astonishing hap- penings. George has agreed to share his amaz- ing data with us. I would appeal to scien- tists from nearby Ohio State University or Bowling Green University to study this phenomenon, getting the facts before they form biases. Here is a situation where mankind can actually observe UFOs on a reoccurring and repeatable basis, so often considered necessary for research by scientists. The huge fish George is raising in his pond are worth the trip, and it appears there is an amazing new otherworld in George Ritter's backyard. He suggests, \"Please don't forget to ask your readers to get involved and use those camcorders that are gathering dust. If just one person in each state could spend a few hours a week, there would be no question on what is flying around in our air space.\" Thanks to George Ritter.

Yang Liwei, a 38-year-old fighter pilot, was launched into space from China's northwest launch pad aboard the Shenzhou V or \"Divine Vessel.\" The rocket carrying Yang lifted off on Oct. 14, 2003, making China the third nation to launch an astronaut, after the USSR and the US. He touched down 21 hours later. The Shenzhou is based on the three- seat Russian Soyuz, with extensive modi- fications. The state-run China Central Television (CCTV) canceled plans to show the launch live, suggesting that Chinese leaders might be worried about the pos- sible political impact if anything went wrong. China used to broadcast satellite launches, but stopped after a rocket ex- ploded following liftoff in 1995, killing six people on the ground. The astronaut launch annoucement was made after it was determined the lift off was success- ful. Massachusetts boomerang NANTUCKET-On Sept. 30,2003, at 9 PM, a boomerang-shaped craft flew east above the buildings at around 500 feet altitude, according to two witnesses who described it as \"slow moving\" and mak- ing no noise. One witness reports, \"I could see the outline and small lights around it, not very bright and dark in color. I saw this thing moving along.\" Thanks to Peter Daven- port, UFOCenter Active light in New York MOOERS - A bright illuminated cir- cular object was observed moving at rapid speed on Sept. 30, 2003, at 7:50 PM. It was flashing off and on, hovering above a big open field. When a light was shined on it, it followed the light and it made rapid 360-degree turns. When the police were called, they had already observed it. When the person observing it went in to call someone else, it disappeared. Thanks to Peter Daven- port. New Jersey windowed object CAPE MAY - On Sept. 25, 2003, at 12:15 PM, three people saw a hovering sphere with windows or holes in a sym- metrical pattern all over the sphere. There were 37 holes that were larger in the cen- ter of the object. The windows got smaller as they went away from the center, and the outline of a sphere was visible. Both the center vertical and center horizontal rows each contained seven holes or windows that emanated white light. The window hole in the center of the intersection had the brightest light. Emanating from each end of the rows were bright rays that gradually dimmed as they departed away from the craft. The other holes had light, but were dimmer than the two center rows. The vertical three center rows of seven windows were brightly lit. There was one row of five window holes on each side of these, and one row of three holes on each side of those. The horizontal rows were of identical descrip- tion.

He states, \"The front part of the tri- angle had four rod-shaped glowing fluo- rescent lights in a wedge shape with two on the back corners, and the center looked transparent as it passed in 15 seconds without a sound. \"I held my hand up at arm's length and the object was slightly larger than my hand and was massive in size. It was flying at low altitude, and when it reached the storm to my right, it flew above the storm out of my view.\" Thanks to Peter Davenport, UFOCenter Splitting lights in Florida WAPAKONETA - It was a clear night on Oct. 5, 2003, with the moon shining brightly, and a couple was driving at 6:30 PM in the hometown of Neil Armstrong, the first man to walk on the moon! They noticed a bright light traveling east in a downward slope that was strobing white, red, and slightly blue lights. Suddenly it slowed way down and split into two small strobing lights. The two lights moved in an opposite direction and then split again into four strobing lights, again moving opposite of each other. They almost seemed to dance in the night sky, according to the witnesses, while some planes flew in from the north.

There were three slightly orange distinct lights at the corners, and the others were soft yellow. \"It took about ten seconds to cross the middle two thirds of the sky we could see,\" says the witness. \"There were no loud droning noises detected, as you would expect from a chopper or fighter jet.

The security officer noticed three lights over the mid- section of the runway about 100 feet off the ground in a triangle shape, and as big as a football field. The witness states, \"While approach- ing the runway, the lights started to fade out. I then called over the radio and other 'Residential' Securities who were in the area confirmed the lights.

The triangle didn't move at all, but when he went to get the video camera, it disappeared. Asimov's generation arks Isaac Asimov advocated the idea of \"generation arks,\" which are enclosed ar- tificial planets that travel through space on long interstellar voyages. Equipped with homeostatic ecologies, Asimov's arks could carry passengers from star to star over hundreds of years. The original colonists who set off on journeys aboard the arks would likely not see the voyage through to the end. How- ever, future generations, born within the ark's delicate enclosed biospheres, could eventually finish the journey initiated by their ancestors. In fact, the story of Noah's Ark may be based on one of these arks traveling from one planet to another. NASA de- signed an enclosed ark that has never been built. New York flying triangle CATSKJLL&COXSACKIE EXITS - Ed Tou writes, \"I was driving on the New York State Thruway and observed a tri- angular-shaped craft with red lights on Saturday, Sept. 27, at 8:30 PM. It hovered over the northbound side of the thruway. \"All cars immediately speeded up to 80-85 mph to get a better view, so I know others witnessed the craft. The object ap- proached from the north and was trian- gular in shape with three red lights at each point. \"It approached the lane I was in and hovered overhead about 40 feet up. The body of the object was gray/metallic, and I had a clear sense this craft was otherworldly. \"This is a second sighting for me,\" says the witness. \"Five of us previously witnessed a UFO in 1995, and reported it to the local police, who shrugged it off. The UFO was the size of two large air- planes but in a shape like a stealth bomber. \"The body was gray with many lights. It hovered over us and made absolutely no sound. We stood in awe and the ob- ject darted to the right and then a sharp left. Within seconds it was just a dot of light in the sky and then it vanished.\" Thanks to Ed Tou. Florida object zooms away WEST PALM BEACH - \"While driv- ing north on A1A towards Palm Beach on Sept. 18, 2003, at 1:30 PM,\" says the witness, \"I noticed a craft that at first re : sembled a commercial airliner. I saw it move slowly westward towards PBIA, and assumed it must be a plane. \"Then all of a sudden it dropped around 500 feet straight down. I reached over to get my digital camera on the seat and kept my eyes on it at all times. Just as I was getting ready to take a picture of it, the craft shot off towards the west at in- credible speed. \"Two hours later, we headed south to Lake Worth Pier to see the waves from hurricane Isabelle and noticed the same craft in the southeastern sky at around 3,000 feet that gradually faded away. The strangest thing about both encounters was the fact that it seemed to know it had been noticed and sped away both times before I could get my camera ready. \"The craft was roughly the size of a commercial airliner in length, and was obviously metallic. It had no wings and had a smooth cigar shape.\" Thanks to Peter Davenport, UFOCenter. Twin sighting in Australia QUEENSLAND - On Sept. 9,2003, at 8:40 p.m., a woman named Louise said she had seen a UFO on her way home from shopping while driving on the Brisbane Valley highway in Borallon, near Lowood, Queensland. Louise said the object was enormous. It had a black base and covered the entire road. It was a box-shaped UFO with a searchlight in front and red lights down the sides.\" A week later, Louise's twin sister, Tracy, rang her to say, 'Sis, you're not going to believe this, but I saw a UFO on my way home from work.\" Tracy's sight- ing on Sept 16, 2003, also took place at about the same time of day, 8:30 p.m., and also over the Borallon area near Lowood.

It looked like a bright star with a hard, almost diamond-like brilliant center sur- rounded by a softer glow of the same color. \"In addition, at the risk of sounding absolutely bonkers, the reason why I got so frightened was I felt like it would have come right down to me, if I hadn't gotten out of the way.\" Thanks to UFOCenter.

Thomas (Eddie) Bullard, while not a hands-on invest! gator of specific abductions, is perhaps the best-known statistical analyst of the ab- duction phenomenon., and his 1987 two-volume study, UFO Abductions: The Mea- sure of a Mystery, is consid- ered the best objective analy- sis of the subject. This study, financed by the Fund for UFO Research, looked at nearly 300 cases, 103 of which were considered the most valuable because they provided both \"extensive information and reliable investigation,\" Bullard explains. \"They got more than they expected, but it was pretty well re- ceived.\" A second study, in 1995, The Sympa- thetic Ear: Investigators as Variables in UFO Abduction Reports, involved a sur- vey of 13 abduction investigators about the content of their personal collection of reports, with responses based on an overall sample of some 1,700 cases. Both studies, which Bullard discussed at the 1999 MUFON Symposium, indi- cated that \"abduction reports bear exten- sive similarities to one another, no matter who investigates, how abductees recall the encounter, in what year the encoun- ter takes place, or in what country the encounter originates,\" says Bullard. He adds, \"Enough differences creep in to suggest that nationality, media, or cultural concerns shape the story to some extent, but most of these apparent influ- ences seem to nibble around the edges and leave the core story untouched.\" He cautions, however, that the two studies \"need to be extended and re- peated if they are to have more than a superficial significance, and even if valid, this sort of evidence is not even in the same ballpark with genuine artifacts or a videotape of aliens caught in the act-two types of evidence that should not be at all out of the question if the phenomenon is in fact physical.\" A staff member at the Indiana Univer- sity library, Bullard received the B.A. at the University of North Carolina, and the masters and Ph.D. degrees from Indiana University. His doctoral dissertation was Bullard titled Mysteries in the Eyes of the Be- holder (1982), and dealt with the UFO phenomenon from the point of view of folklore. He has also compiled The Airship File (1982, 1990), an extensive collection of news- paper clippings which deal with the \"airship\" sightings re- ported around the turn of the century. Bullard does not find the air- ship sightings compelling, not- ing, \"One conclusion I feel cer- tain about is the absence of anything unknown during the airship waves. Here is a cau- tionary tale to show that people can believe they saw something out of the ordinary, when in fact they saw only Venus or fire balloons.\" Abductions, however, are a different matter, and he has taken issue with de- bunkers of the abduction phenomenon \"whose approaches are seldom empiri- cally based, and which suffer from a host of factual, logical, and methodological problems.\" He notes that \"critics are disappointed by reports that change little over a period of 30 years, since they expect to see re- flections of cultural influence at every turn.\" Bullard, speaking as an expert on folk- lore and myths, says, \"A first step in un- derstanding UFOs must be disentangle- ment of the myth from the evidence,\" not- ing that the word myth is misused by de- bunkers and skeptics when applied to UFOs. He elaborates on this in his chapter on \"UFOs: Lost in the Myths/' in the book UFOs and Abductions: Challenging the Borders of Knowledge (edited by David M. Jacobs, University of Kansas Press, 2000). His own view is that \"the evidence I have seen—the consistencies, physical evidence, multiple-witness cases-leave me with no choice but an objective event for the answer. Like J. Allen Hynek, I can- not dismiss the residuum of detailed, well- observed, well-investigated reports that continue to stand despite all efforts to explain them.\" He adds, \"The explanation of extrater- restrial activity serves the evidence well enough in most cases, so I have to give this explanation serious consideration.\" But Bullard emphasizes that \"ques- tions of the ultimate nature and purpose of these visitations hold only secondary interest to me as long as the answers rely on speculation, rather than'evidence, for their substance. Piling one mystery on top of another just doesn't appeal to me, and I prefer the less imaginative course of following the evidence where it leads, with only short excursions beyond it.\" This cautious, conservative approach has served Bullard well as a member of the board of directors of the J. Allen Hynek Center for UFO Studies, as well as bolstering his reputation as a respected researcher, author, academic, and speaker. He continues to work on abductions, and is especially interested in the 1983 case ofNobel Prize winner Dr. Kary Mullis, who reportedly encountered a talking raccoon and experienced missing time and teleportation (see the April, 2003, is- sue of the Journal). \"This has to be more than sleep pa- ralysis,\" says Bullard.

Although we were not close friends, as our views on UFOs were poles apart, I had known Graham and his brother Mark for 25 years, and had great admi- ration for what he had achieved. I know that his loss will be keenly felt by many. Graham and Mark first came to my at- tention when they set up the Yorkshire UFO Society in the heady days of the mid-1970s when UFO enthusiasm was at its peak in Britain. Their patch was on the opposite side of the Pennine Hills from my own (Lancashire, my home, and York- shire, that of the Birdsalls, were enemies in the war of the roses, and that friendly rivalry persists centuries later). During those days they researched many fascinating cases, and I have cited some in my books, well aware of the debt owed for the great effort put in by Gra- ham whilst investigating these matters swiftly and on the spot. Graham's approach to UFOs was very traditional, but equally dynamic. He sensed that they were alien in origin and championed with great skill the fight against what was perceived to be gov- .ernment cover-up of their existence. As you probably know, I take a rather more restrained line on these issues, see- ing UFOs as mostly misperceptions, but with some fascinating unsolved cases not so explained. Whilst I would never elimi- nate the ETH as an option, I have not been powerfully persuaded that it is nec- essarily the most likely to be true. As for the government attitude, whilst I am certain that the powers-that-be re- main intrigued by this phenomenon and have studied it in some detail, I suspect the cover-up to be born more out of bu- reaucratic ineptitude and ignorance of the truth than from certainty about the na- ture of UFOs or secreted hard evidence. This fundamental difference of opin- ion meant that Graham and I were never likely to work closely together, but I was well aware from the start that he believed what he thought with great sincerity and I had no problem whatsoever with that. I am not so foolish as to think his opin- ions must be nonsense and mine obvi- ous truth. Nobody can be sure what is going on in the UFO world, and I : was more than happy to agree to disagree, al- lowing us to get on reasonably well, and certainly in an amicable manner. Which is no mean feat, given that many UFOlogists seem able to fall out with me at some stage with relative ease! The fact that Graham remained civil is certainly a testament to his character. When he started the now annual con- ferences in his home city of Leeds, the now widely distributed UFO Magazine was not yet around. YUFOS produced its own low budget journal known as Quest, which in the late 70s and early 80s still displayed many of the features you will find today-just with no glossy pages, photos, or sales in all major newsagents. That Quest turned into UFO Maga- zine is at least in part because of Graham's extraordinary determination, marketing skills, and belief in what he was doing (plus, of course, the hard work of brother Mark and others in his group). Whatever personal reservations I have had about the content of some issues of UFO Magazine, I have always had huge admiration for the way it has been put together and the remarkable success it has been. This has sent the message of UFOlogy far and wide in ways few researchers can ever claim to have achieved. For years now Graham has been a spokesperson for UFOlogy, representing the UK with pride at conferences the world over, and consulted by the media on a daily basis. I lectured at several of those early con- ferences in Leeds until around 1983, be- ing very happy to support the fledgling group and magazine, quite often because Graham or Mark were hard to turn down when they asked so politely. Eventually they stopped asking, as they were able to attract much bigger names in UFOlogy from overseas-and I guess our differing views became more obvious. I doubt the audiences that were by now swarming to Leeds in huge num- bers wanted to hear my more downbeat thinking on UFOs! The Birdsalls knew exactly what they had come to hear, and were very adept at providing it. Nobody knew how to market UFOlogy better. Another factor in our distancing was the infamous Cracoe Fell case (see The UFOs that Never Were, London House, 2000). Lights were photographed beside a Yorkshire cliff face and given wide me- dia exposure. YUFOS adopted the case and turned it into a major investigation. The problem was that there existed conflicting evi- dence that suggested to some UFOlogists, notably at the British UFO Research Association, where I was then Director of Investigations, that this was not a UFO. In fact it was a complex opti- cal reflection off the cliff face. BUFORA (and myself personally) adopted that position, and for a time Gra- ham was, shall we say, peeved at me. However, some time later YUFOS came to accept that this was probably the answer, and I think he forgave my transgression. We never had a serious row over what was, after all, just a difference of opinion over the interpretation of evidence. I wish that this could be true of more people in UFOlogy when they fall out over how to resolve a case. I still recall those early Leeds confer- ences with a happy smile, and have the \"award certificate\" that Graham pleasantly embarrassed me by presenting. It hangs on my office wall as a joyful reminder of those days and of his larger than life smile. UFOlogy in Britain has lost a great character in Graham Birdsall, and his fam- ily, with whom I know he was close, have been in my thoughts. Although I am sure that, thanks to those around him, UFO Magazine will go on, since it has always been very much a team effort, the trag- edy at the helm of this publication, so soon after Gordon Creighton, as.editor of the timeless Flying Saucer Review, also passed away, was a \"double whammy\" as they say in the UK. Whilst Gordon Creighton was of a ripe old age, Graham's passing inevitably hits (Continued on Page 17) Page 16 MUFON UFO Journal November 2003"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"Scientists think that 25 percent of Sun-like stars have planets About 5 percent of relatively nearby Sun-like stars are known to harbor plan- ets. But researchers typically find more extrasolar worlds the longer and harder they examine a star. So most astronomers assume the number is higher. A new set of calculations estimates that at least 25 percent of all Sun-like stars in our galaxy have planets around them. \"We are not saying that 25 percent of stars have planets; we are saying that at least 25 percent of Sun-like stars have planets,\" says Charles Lineweaver of the University of New South Wales in Sydney. \"It could be the case that close to 100 percent of stars have planets. This means that there are at least 100 billion stars with planets in our galaxy.\" And with roughly 400 billion stars thought to populate the Milky Way, the number of planets could be higher, he said. Lineweaver and colleague Daniel Grether took into account how lengthy monitoring and improved techniques have found planets around the handful of stars that are monitored. They also considered that stars with highly active surfaces can make planet detection more difficult, and the fact that any smaller planets, akin to the rocky worlds in our solar system, are not yet detectable at all. \"If the Sun were one of the stars be- View from Britain...

The UK has had a number of them of late, including Ken Phillips (my mentor at BUFORA and a highly underrated in- fluence on the UK scene) and Stuart Smith, who collapsed and died whilst at- tending a conference along with many of us in Vienna. I know that the Ameri- can UFO scene has had similar losses. Perhaps UFOlogy requires such dedi- cation and committment of its proponents that it saps the strength if you have the guts and determination to stay the pace for long enough. Graham Birdsall had these qualities in abundance, but has also left a legacy that British UFOlogy will not soon forget. ing monitored, we still would not have detected any planets around it,\" Lineweaver points out. Previous similar estimates have put the figure as high as 15 percent. A paper on the new calculations will be published in December in the Astrophysical Journal.

Upon looking as it flew over, she no- ticed another aircraft gliding across the sky at what appeared to be a lower alti- tude and slower speed than the normal commercial traffic. She described this craft as being highly unusual, appearing as if two cylinders were side by side, but connected with some sort of middle structure that she had difficulty seeing clearly from her vantage point. The cylinders were described as being longer than the center section, about l\"tol 1/4\" at arm's length. She watched for about 20 seconds, when a burst of light emanated from the craft, appearing to her like something huge floodlights would cause, but brighter (reflection of sunlight?). The bril- liance of this flash seemed to be about the size of a quarter at arm's length. The unusual craft continued on until it left the area. Please note that this mem- ber/observer has provided reliable data to our Georgia Hqs. over the past few years and IS NOT prone to hasty observation or excitement. More plainly stated, she has a reliable eagle eye and a calm focus that would have made her an excellent aircraft ob- server back when that technique was a vital part of our national defense. We are currently making arrangements for FI John Pander of Suwanee, GA, to work with Ms. Linda in an attempt to iden- tify what she observed. The first laser-powered aircraft. NASA tests first laser-powered plane Ever since the dawn of powered flight, it has been necessary for all aircraft to carry onboard fuel-whether in the form of batteries, fuel, solar cells, or even a human \"engine\"-in order to stay aloft. But a team of researchers from NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center in Hunts- ville, AL; NASA's Dryden Flight Research Center at Edwards, CA; and the Univer- sity of Alabama in Huntsville is trying to change that. They have now chalked up a major accomplishment and a \"first.\" The team has developed and demonstrated a small- scale aircraft that flies solely by means of propulsive power delivered by an invis- ible, ground-based laser. The laser tracks the aircraft in flight, directing its energy beam at specially de- signed photovoltaic cells carried onboard to power the plane's propeller. \"The craft could keep flying as long as the energy source, in this case the la- ser beam, is uninterrupted,\" said Robert Burdine, Marshall's laser project manager for the test. \"This is the first time that we know of that a plane has been powered only by the energy of laser light. It really is a groundbreaking development for avia- tion.\" The plane, with its five-foot wingspan, weighs only 11 ounces, and is con- structed from balsa wood and carbon fi- ber tubing, and is covered with Mylar film, a cellophane-like material. A special panel of photovoltaic cells, selected and tested by team participants at the University of Alabama in Hunts- ville, is designed to efficiently convert the energy from the laser wavelength into electricity to power a small electric motor that spins the propeller. The lightweight, low-speed plane was flown indoors at Marshall to prevent wind and weather from affecting the tests.

Friedman Attacks on Barney Barnett I seem to be spending an awful lot of time this year rebutting baseless ahti- Roswell and anti-MJ-12 attacks: I started the year with a 9000-word review of Kevin Randle's book Case MJ-12. concluding that none of his objections to the MJ- 12documents stand up. It is on my website: http://www.v-j- enterprises.com/ sfhome.html. I finished my MUFON 2003 Symposium paper, \"Critiquing the Roswell Critics,\" in early April, and shortly thereafter, two more base- Stanton Friedman less attacks on Roswell were made in cover stories in Popular Mechanics and Skeptic Maga- zine. I responded to these in an article in UFO Magazine in the August/Septem- ber issue. Now the Spring, 2003, issue of Inter- national UFO Reporter (p. 15 et seq) has published yet another splendid example of UFO debunkery. Surprisingly, the co- authors are Kevin Randle and Karl Pflock. Both have written science fiction, both have been strongly anti-MJ-12 in the past, and both have also been strongly anti the Plains of San Augustin crash as de- scribed by Barney Barnett and others in, for example, Don Berliner's and my Crash at Corona: The Definitive Stua\\' of the Roswell Incident. Both presented opposition statements in the Canadian TV Documentary (2002) \"Stanton T. Friedman IS Real.\" But Randle has been convinced that there was a crash on the Brazel ranch, judging by his many books, while Pflock insists in his 2001 book, Roswell: Incon- venient Facts and the Will to Believe, that no UFO ever crashed in New Mexico. Strangely the article almost implies that Randle is moving away from the no- tion of an alien spacecraft near Corona. \"It was just a field littered with odd, not easily identified debris, much of it metal- lic... nothing to suggest a craft from an- other world.\" Clearly, manufactured material not yet duplicated here on earth, but it is not from another world?? Their joint effort is entitled \"Barney Barnett's Crashed Saucer: Where did it come from?\" They seemed to have started from a conclusion that there was no crash in the Plains, 'and worked backwards, stressing the absence of evidence that they would accept (such as an alien body, a piece of the saucer, footage of the vehicle with identifiable military people, etc). They seem to want to make a report of a crashed UFO a criminal matter, in which case it cannot be accepted without evi- dence beyond a reasonable doubt. But there is no crime involved, and the stan- dard by any reasonable person should be \"a preponderance of the evidence.\" They admit that a small number of the people had heard from Barney about the crash long before the 1980 publication of The Roswell Incident. Then they say that since there was a small scattering of articles about crashed saucers in various men's magazines, Time, and Frank Scully's book, Behind the Fly- ing Saucers, in the early 1950s, that Barney must have used one or more of these as models for his made up story. He probably read them at the local bar- bershop! Barney was essentially bald for most of his life, but why mention that? They don't directly call Barney a hoaxer or a liar, but surely imply these insults. One section is headed \"A Shaggy Sau- cer Story\"!! Basis provided for Barney's character to be so assaulted? NONE. They say Barney \"leaked\" the story to Vern and Jean Maltais, his wife Ruth's niece, Alice Knight, his boss James Fleck Danley, and, much later, his neighbor, Mr. Harold Baca. They, of course, don't mention that Alice Knight signed a sworn statement saying she had heard the story in late 1947, well before all the supposed sources had been published. Leaked is a totally inappropriate word. One thing missing from this article is a clear context of Barney's relationship to these people. Barney and Ruth Barnett had no children of their own. They were especially close to Alice, who had a baby in the summer of 1947. The Maltais were also sort of substi- tute children. Ruth even notes in her di- ary, which they significantly misrepresent, how much she was looking forward to a visit from Alice and hearing about the new baby. The Maltais are mentioned as well. These were personal at-home or office dis- closures with people who were totally trusted. They weren't just casual ac- quaintances, and there were no comments in newspapers, books, etc. Randle and Pflock seem disturbed by the fact that Barney's boss (Fleck Danley), in Bill Moore's first conversa- tion with him, did not recall the exact date and location (he said \"I will have to think on that\" ) until a second and third visit .... More than 30 years later. And they expect instant recall?? Barney had been dead since 1969. Fleck Danley, with whom I had also spo- ken (as well as with his wife Beth, Alice, the Maltais, Mr. Baca , and military of- ficer William Leed-other recipients of comments from Barney), made clear that Barney had told the experience of com- ing across a crashed craft and strange bodies very shortly (same day) after it happened, long before any of the articles had appeared. Fleck's initial response was disbelief until he realized that he (unlike Randle and Pflock) had never had any reason to disbelieve anything Barney said/They both worked for the US Government's Soil Conservation Service. Barney, a civil engineer, was a WWI army veteran. His work required the con- fidence of the ranchers with whom he dealt on a daily basis. A reputation as a practical joker or teller of tall tales would have destroyed that trust. I had located Mr. Baca, who owned a store in Socorro, by placing a letter seek- ing contact with those who had known Barney, in the Socorro Defensor Chief- tain newspaper. Barney had been suffering from can- cer and was very weak. He had fallen in the bathroom late one night in the 1960s, and Ruth had called Harold to ask for help in getting Barney up from the floor. Harold asked Barney where he thought he got his cancer. Barney said possibly from exposure to the strange bodies next to the saucer that he had seen out in the Plains. Without any reference to Barney's medical records, Randle and Pflock sug- gest that it was probably from exposure to mustard gas in World W W 1,30 years Page 18 MUFON UFO Journal November 2003"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"earlier than the crash! Incredible medical diagnostics. NOT. A dying man continues with a made up story which he tells to a much younger neighbor for no gain, no benefit?? William Leed heard Bill Moore and me on a Toronto radio program. He called in, we got his number, I followed up, and have met with him twice since, besides several phone conversations. Bill, now retired, told me that he had an interest in many strange phenomena, and that his boss in the military, a colo- nel, was talking with him in the 1960s about UFOs and said, \"Here is a guy who actually touched one, and here is his ad- dress (in Socorro).\" When Bill was in Arizona on military business, he made a special side trip to Socorro, MM. Barney wouldn't say any- thing about the crash until Bill showed him his military credentials. He told his story and noted that he had been interro- gated by military people at least three times. This was in the early 1960s. Barnett's name hadn't come up in the radio program. How did the colonel know details about somebody who had such a low profile unless he had heard them within official channels? Any reason to think he would lie to a subordinate? Leed is now retired, and was a very successful businessman operat- ing a steel company. Would Barney have asked for credentials if he had made up the story? Randle and Pflock mention that I heard from Vern and Jean Maltais in Bemidji, MN, but not that it was at the end of my lecture at Bemidji State College (now University), and that they had left and then came back in to talk to me pri- vately at my table of papers. It wasn't at a meeting of a local wild eyed group. Vem worked for the US gov- ernment at the Veterans Administration. Again a very unlikely liar. Randle and Pflock also do not note that the testimony of 27 different Roswell witnesses, including Vern, is on a video, \"Recollections of Roswell\"(105 Minutes, $ 15 including S and H, from UFORI, FOB 958,Houlton, ME 04730-0958). Of course Randle and Pflock don't mention that the local postmistress of Datil had told of a crash in the Plains, with a flat bed truck carrying it through town late at night. They don't mention rancher Marvin Ake noting that he had heard of a UFO crash in the Plains. They make no mention of the out- standing research by Victor Golubic and retired teacher Art Campbell, who both have spent loads of time interviewing people in the Plains, and conclude that there was probably a saucer crash out there. They don't mention archeologist Robert Drake's noting that a PhD friend, Roscoe Wilmuth, told him that he had read of a crash in the Plains while work- ing at the Los Alamos documents library in the 1940s. They also don't mention that others in Socorro who knew Barney thought he was very much a straight arrow. Randle and Pflock belittle Ruth's di- ary, almost implying that Alice might have faked it, since Alice supposedly had ear- lier insisted she knew of no diary. But they say the diary places Barney in the SCS office in Socorro on July 3: \"He couldn't have been out in the Plains to view the remains of an alien ship and its crew.\" What the diary says is, \"Barney was in office most of the day.\" It is clear from the more than 40 diary entries mention- ing Barney's trips to the high country, the plains, near Datil, etc, that he could easily have gone out to the plains and then returned to the office after being chased away by the military. It is not that long a trip. On July 2 it says, \"Barney went to the high country near Datil.\" On July 4 \"Barney wasn't feeling very well\".... guess the mustard gas got to him. I was certainly not surprised by Randle's attacks, since he has been at- tacking the Plains case (I can't find a rea- son) from the start. In one of his many creative notions, he first claimed that Barney must have been near Corona, because it was in his SCS district, and then lied to Ruth be- cause he couldn't tell her the truth. The fact is that the Corona site is NOT in Barney's district, and there is no evi- dence whatsoever of his lying to Ruth. It is of course much farther to the Corona site than to the Plains. In the absence of any reason for re- jecting the firsthand testimony of Alice Knight, Vern and Jean Maltais, Harold Baca, Robert Drake, William Leed ,etc, and the secondhand testimony of Barney, it logically follows that on the balance of probability, Barney was telling the truth. It is a logical and rational and sensible conclusion. I will leave the question of the motivation for the attacks made in the article open. Perhaps one reason might be that Frank Kaufrnann had claimed the Barnett story was just a diversion, and Randle had believed him. To his credit, he and Pflock now note that Kaufrnann has been thoroughly discredited. Stan Friedman fsphys@rogers.com The lights emanating from the UFO as it split into two, as recorded by Al Hajer. The blur at the lower left is the Batelco tower light. Strange lights videotaped in Bahrain Various individuals in the Persian Gulf island nation of Bahrain, home base for numerous U.S. military units, have reported seeing an unidentified flying object emitting strange lights for about a minute at around 11 pm on Oct. 17. Bahraini Mohammed Jaffer Al Hajer was sitting with six of his friends outside his home in Qurrayah village near Budaiya when they noticed the UFO in the distant skies. Al Hajer \"caught\" the strange object on his digital video camera as the lights appeared twice—once when the UFO emitted a bright yellow light, and the second time when it split into two before disappearing. \"We first noticed the strange light appear to the left of the Batelco tower in the village,\" he said. \"We saw it again just above the tower when I reached for my camera and began to video tape it.\" Al Hajer videotaped the object for about 40 seconds before it disappeared. The pictures were not clear because of the high speed of the object and the low camera resolution, according to Al Hajer. People in Manama also reported see- ing the UFO at the same time, and placed it between Manama and Muharraq, in the same vicinity as Al Hajer claimed. Sources at Bahrain International Airport tower said the radars there did not regis- ter any abnormal activity during that time.

I prefer not to call them \"My top 10 UFO cases\" for that very reason. Over the years my research has been primarily devoted to the 1947 Roswell incident, underground bases, Area 51, and the Great Pyramids ofGiza. In reality there Balthaser are probably hun- dreds of cases that could be listed, and I discovered early on in my research that it's impossible for me to investigate or research all phases of this subject, but I can still have an interest in them, even though I might not personally be re- searching them. The list of my ten favorite UFO cases is not in any order as far as importance to me, but rather ten of the cases that I per- sonally feel are worth further investiga- tion or research, based on the informa- tion already known. I cannot tell you that all cases are fac- tual either, and until validated informa- tion is brought forward to prove or dis- prove them satisfactorily, I will continue to have an interest in these and others.

The United States Air Force has unsuccessfully given four excuses over the past 55 years to explain what actually happened. Most major afternoon newspapers west of Chicago reported the crash on July 8,1947, stating, \"RAAF Captures Fly- ing Saucer On Ranch in Roswell Region.\" The next day, July 9, 1947, Gen. Ramey 's weather balloon cover story was in major newspapers east of Chicago. Hundreds of firsthand witnesses have been interviewed since 1978 when the Editor's Note: Mr. Balthaser's favor- ite cases, and his descriptions of them, do not necessarily reflect the choices or opinions of the editor or MUFON staff. investigation again started. New Mexico Congressman Steven Schiff had the GAO (General Accounting Office) investigate the Roswell Incident, only to have the United States Air Force issue a 1995 re- port stating it was a Mogul balloon. In 1997 the Air Force issued their fourth excuse, stating the bodies found were anthropomorphic crash test dum- mies. The dummies, however, were not used until 1953, six years after the Roswell Incident happened. The debunkers, skeptics, and non-be- lievers have failed miserably in satisfac- torily explaining what actually happened near Roswell, NM, in 1947. 1964 Socorro NM: Known as the Lonnie Zamora case. Zamora was a po- liceman for the city of Socorro who on April 24, 1964, during a high-speed ve- hicle chase, was deviated from the chase by the sight of a blue flame under an ob- ject in the distance. His first thought when approaching was that it was an overturned vehicle with two people nearby. Within several hun- dred feet of where Zamora stopped his police car, he saw a white, egg-shaped object standing on four legs with a bright polished metal surface. Within moments of being spotted by one of the beings outside the craft, he heard the slamming of a thick metallic door and a low frequency roar which eventually rose to a higher pitch. The craft began rising with a bright blue and orange flame visible underneath the craft. Later inspection of the site revealed impressions in the ground where the craft had landed. Project Blue Book classified the case as an \"unknown.\" Debunkers have theorized that it was a hot air balloon, but the flame on hot air balloons must go upwards, not down- ward, to heat the balloon envelope for lift. Area 51 : Known by many other names, such as Dreamland, the box, the dark side of the moon, and the ranch, Area 51 is a secret military base located 85 miles north- west of Las Vegas, NV. It has been in existence since the 1950s, but only re- cently has the government and military About the author Dennis Balthaser, a MUFON Field In- vestigator, served.for three years (1959- 62) with the Army. After some 33 years in civil engineering, Dennis retired from the Texas Department of Transportation in 1996 and moved to Roswell, NM, to pur- sue his avocation: ufology. Nine months later he assumed the du- ties of International UFO Museum and Research Center (IUFOMRC) Operations Manager, served on the Board of Direc- tors, and became the UFO Investigator for the Museum as a full time volunteer.

What transpires there is some of the highest security work in the United States, some of which includes testing of new type air- craft, radioactive research, etc. It has been reported that extraterres- trial craft and possibly alien bodies are housed at this installation in an area known as S-4. Reports of 22 levels below ground have also been noted. Security is some of the highest in the country with signs at the perimeter of the base that warn trespassers that, \"the use of deadly force is authorized.\" I don't want our military development secrets re- vealed to our adversaries, but if alien craft or bodies are kept there, I am interested in that for the future of our children and grandchildren. Fire in the Sky: Travis Walton's Nov. 5, 1975, abduction experience has been recorded both in book form and big screen movie. Riding with other loggers in the mountains of northeastern Arizona, an unusually bright light was observed just off the road. Walton got out of the truck to view it closer and as he walked toward the light, he was blasted with a bolt of unknown energy. The other logger's fled the scene in fear, but eventually returned to the site. Walton was not to be found.

Our nearest planet neigh- bor lies near the lunar crescent on the 25th and is also to the upper left of tiny Mercury for the first half of the month. Mars, moving into Pisces, fades from -0.4 to 0.2 magnitude during December. The red planet appears in the SSE at twi- light, advances westward, and sets in the W about midnight. It is near the quarter Moon on the 1st, 29th, and 30th. Late in the month Europe's Mars Ex- press spacecraft arrives at its destination following its launch last June. It is sched- uled to land a little surface lab called Beagle 2 on Mars. Jupiter (-2.1), in Leo, rises in the E about 11 PM in midmonth and then moves westward in the southern sky. Saturn, still retrograding in Gemini, rises in the NE about 6:30 on Dec. 1 and about 4:15 on the 31 st when it is exactly opposite the Sun. At opposition the ringed giant planet shines at -0.5 magnitude, is visible all night, and is closer to Earth than it will be for more than the next quarter century. Saturn lies near the gibbous Moon on the 10th. Bright Planets (Morning Sky): Jupiter stands in the SSW sky at dawn. The gas giant can be seen near the quarter Moon on December 16. Saturn sets in the NW near sunrise (toward the end of the month at opposi- tion). Meteor Shower: Unfortunately, this year a bright gib- bous Moon washes out many of the Geminid meteors when they reach their peak on the night of Dec. 13-14.

Look for the Great Hunter Orion in the SE, his shoulders marked by reddish Betelgeuse and bluish-white Bellatrix, his belt by three stars in a row, and his legs by Saiph and bright Rigel. Astride the celestial meridian high in the N can be found one of the most popu- lar deep sky objects in the heavens, the Double Cluster of Perseus. Look for two patches of light close together between the \"M\" shape of Queen Cassiopeia and the fishhook shape of Perseus the Champion. Then focus on the twin spots with binoculars or a telescope. The spots resolve into hundreds of stars, many of them a few thousand times the diameter of our Sun. Another outstanding star cluster is the Pleiades or \"Seven Sisters\" located in the S in the shoulder of the Bull Taurus (whose right eye is marked by the orange star Aldebaran). In a dark sky, you should see at least six of the stars arranged in a dipper shape. Optical aid will reveal many more stars in this little cluster. Nov. 8, 2003-Maj.

Walton finally reap- peared, disoriented, to a world of disbe- lievers and interrogations that would change his life forever. Great Pyramids of Giza: I was asked to join the Advisory Board of the Great Pyramids of Giza Research Association. Many of us believe that the pyramids of Giza are much older than we've been told, primarily due to the fact that the deterio- ration of the Sphinx was probably done by water rather than wind and sand ero- sion. Since there hasn't been a large quan- tity of water in that region for over 15,000 years, it would mean that the pyramids of Giza are pre-Egyptian. If that's the case, and the Pyramids were not built by Egyp- tians, who built them? Some theorize that perhaps there was \"ET\" involvement, due to the technology required to construct the only remaining structures of the Seven Wonders of the World. Barney and Betty Hill Abduction: One of the best-documented abduction cases on record. While traveling from Canada to their home in Portsmouth, NH, at about 10:15 PM on Sept. 19, 1961, the couple noticed a light in the sky below the moon that kept getting closer to them. As it got closer, Barney was able to see occupants standing inside the craft. Because of the time required to make the trip (two hours longer than normal), both Barney and Betty believed that they had been abducted and given medical ex- aminations. Betty claimed to have been shown a star map with information that mainstream science didn't know about until years later. 1952 Washington, D.C. Incident: Over a ten-day period, Washington, D.C., was \"invaded\" by UFOs witnessed by radar controllers, pilots, and crews of both com- mercial and military aircraft, as well as ground observers. The craft detected on radar screens would hover in one position at times and also dart up and down. F-94 interceptors were called in, but by that time the targets were gone. Maj. Gen. John A. Samford, Air Force director of intelligence, announced at the Penta- gon on July 29, 1952, that the radar and visual sightings over the Washington, D.C., area \"were due to mirage effects cre- ated by a double temperature inversion.\" (Continued on Page 22) Page 21"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"Ten favorite cases...

Phoenix\" Lights: Seen by thousands of witnesses on the ground, many with cameras and video equipment, oh March 13,1997. Described as very large (the size of a Boeing 747), reported to have had the sound of rushing wind, V-shaped with large lights on the leading edge. The lights were seen in the states of Nevada and Arizona over a three-hour period as they crossed those states. The Luke AFB Public Affairs office an- nounced two months later that their in- vestigation had revealed that the lights were flares dropped from A-10 aircraft over the Gila Bend Firing Range. The na- tional news media didn't report anything until June 18,1997, when USA Today had an article ten weeks after the event. Kenneth Arnold Sighting: On June 24, 1947, two weeks before the Roswell Inci- dent, pilot Kenneth Arnold reported see- ing nine shiny objects traveling at an es- timated speed of 1,300-1,600 mph while flying his aircraft between Mt. Rainer and Mt. Adams in the state of Washington. Coining the term \"flying saucer\" is credited to reporter William C. Bequette, who at the time worked in the newsroom of the Pendleton East Oregonian. Arnold had described the movement of the craft as similar to a saucer being skipped across water. Aztec, NM, Crash, March 1948: A 99- foot diameter craft containing \"16 little men\" crashed outside of Aztec, NM, in Hart Canyon. A high security recovery operation took place over the next two weeks. Some researchers believe the date should be changed to later (March, 1950), when the Farmington, NM, Daily Times newspaper had a front page headline de- scribing an armada of flying saucers that were witnessed by Farmington residents over a three-day period, describing esti- mated speeds at 1000 mph. Many other cases such as the Dulce underground base, the Maury Island In- cident, Shag Harbor, the White Sands Landing in the 50's, and my own 1997 In- terception experience would qualify as personal favorites for a larger list.

November 2003 MUFON UFO Journal Page 23"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"By John F. Schuessler MUFON International Director What is MUFON? MUFON is many things to many people. Some people see MUFON as a publisher of a monthly UFO magazine. Some see it as a place to report UFOs. Some see it as a place to get answers. Some see it as a place to complain. Some believe it has a headquarters with a large staff available to do al- most anything re- quested. And there are many more beliefs about MUFON than I can list here. Some of those beliefs are based on fact, but John Schuessler others are not. The bottom line is that MUFON is a 35-year-old volunteer organization dedi- cated to working on the various facets of the UFO mystery. Our membership is as diverse and varied as is the United Na- tions organization. We do not require people to have a specific \"belief in order to join MUFON, but we do expect them to be honest, sin- cere, and a bit tolerant of the beliefs and feelings of others. We do not condone personal attacks on individuals for any reason. MUFON continues to receive a ro- bust flow of UFO reports, pointing out that the mystery is far from solved. UFOs are still a hot topic. Fifty-plus years of attempts to explain UFOs away or to limit the inquiry about them has failed miser- ably. Other organizations have come and gone without bringing closure to this mystery, but MUFON is still working as hard as ever, thanks to its membership. The MUFON headquarters office now operates rent free out of the home of John & Kathy Schuessler. We maintain the membership database and the MUFON UFO Journal monthly mailing database; receive and answer all snail mail, e-mail, FAXes. and telephone calls; pay all bills; order, maintain, and ship all MUFON mer- chandise; receive and process all snail mail and PayPal membership requests and renewals; edit all special publications, such as the annual symposium proceed- ings and the investigator's manual; an- swer all press, radio and TV inquiries; work in cooperation with a number of other UFO groups and organizations; and lots more. There is no other staff avail- able to do any of this. The MUFON archives now operate rent free out of the home of Lin & Bob Simpson. It is at this location that the MUFON Pandora Project has been de- veloped. It is now operational and in need of volunteers and funding to keep it go- ing. This project is aimed at making all of the paper files available to researchers in electronic form. Lin is also the MUFON Membership Director. She works tirelessly on new membership initiatives and the recruiting of new talents to this field. She cannot do it alone, so I hope you will find ways to help her in this endeavor. A member- ship representative in every state would be a good starting place. Since UFO field investigations are key to the work we are doing, it is important to continually develop and expand the field investigator team. Much of this is done through self-study, but training classes are held when there are a suffi- cient number of members available to train. Kathleen Marden handles the field investigator examination process to as- sure a high level of proficiency for our investigators. The MUFON Business Board of Di- rectors members all volunteer their time and expenses to develop and enforce policies, plan for the future, provide fis- cal guidance, make all the hard decisions for the organization, and much more. For the past several years, Dwight Connelly has tirelessly edited the MUFON UFO Journal. Dwight depends on state directors, researchers, investi- gators, authors, and others to submit a flow of material for the Journal. He recognizes that not everyone will like every article, so he provides a wide variety of material in every issue. He de- livers a print ready version of the Journal to the publisher on time every month so it can be mailed to subscribers by the 15 th of the month. The excellent cadre of MUFON State Directors in the U.S., along with National and Provincial Directors elsewhere, re- cruit new members; provide field investi- gator training; hold general membership meetings; assure that local group mem- bers are MUFON members; create inter- face relationships with police, airports. and news media; assign cases; monitor their progress and submit reports to MUFON Headquarters; handle the WUFOD (World UFO Database) reports for their state; develop public awareness; attend the annual MUFON UFO Sympo- sium; and submit an annual report of their activities. The State Directors are supported in the field by State Section Directors, Field Investigators, membership and public re- lations people, trainers, meeting organiz- ers, and specialists of all kinds. This is a big job, and vital to the success of MUFON. Credibility of MUFON research and investigations is greatly enhanced by our several hundred volunteer Research Spe- cialists and Consultants. In a field as complex as this one, this highly qualified cadre of experts is a treasured asset. I am also pleased to recognize the roles of the many hundreds of individuals who work in their own ways to keep this field viable, and this includes the folks that just want to be subscribers to the maga- zine to support the MUFON work. We appreciate everyone's contributions. If you ever wonder why we do all of this, it is because we recognize how im- portant this work is and how vital the outcome may be to society as a whole. Most of us have seen what we believe is a critical mass of evidence amassed from the thousands of UFO reports from around the world. We take it all very se- riously. This is all summed up in MUFON's Mission Statement, as follows: \"The Sci- entific Study of UFOs for the Benefit of Mankind.\" We support this mission with the fol- lowing goals: 1) Investigate UFO Sightings and collect the data in the MUFON Database for use by research- ers worldwide; 2) Promote Research on UFOs to discover the true nature of the phenomenon, with an eye towards scien- tific breakthroughs, and improving life on our planet; and 3) Educate the Public on the UFO phenomenon and its potential impact on society. In the coming months we will be an- nouncing the specific strategies we will be using to accomplish our goals. The key to success, however, is you, the MUFON members. Please consider what you can do to help us make this huge job a success. (Continued on Page 22) Page 24 MUFON UFO Journal November 2003"}]
