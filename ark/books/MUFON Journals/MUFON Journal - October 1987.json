FROM THE EDITOR Late as it is, and for reasons beyond our control, we hope you enjoy this issue of the Journal. The November number will be along shortly. In the meantime, our lead article on ufology in Canada is Stanton Friedman's, summer Symposium paper, which arrived too late for inclusion in the Proceedings. We also have on hand a proposal by Ann Druffel which delineates possible support groups for UFO close encounter and abduction victims, and a classification system by Dr. Arlan Andrews which divides the UFO experience into its physical and psychic components. We are equally proud of the material we have on hand for future issues of the Journal, including more in-depth analysis of the MJ-12 documents, a new look at the Eduard Meier case, and a cover photograph of, and accompanying article about, the Marfa Lights of west Texas, a \"ghost light\" phenomenon that can be traced back more than a hundred years.

Friedman Stanton Friedman is a well- known UFO researcher and nu- clear physicist. ABSTRACT Canada has had many reports of UFO sightings, several UFO groups, at least two official government sponsored investigative bodies and has also managed to cover up significant UFO information. The Access to Information law has been used to obtain a good deal of data though much more about what government has been doing has apparently been hidden or destroyed. Public interest in a scientific approach appears to be strong. The National Research Council file of a few thousand reports is ripe for detailed investigation by serious researchers able to devote considerable time and effort to the pursuit of more information since the NRC itself has done essentially no investigation of \"non- meteor\" sightings. INTRODUCTION It is not surprising that many aspects of ufology in Canada are quite similar to those in other countries. There have been Canadian sightings, landings, physical trace cases and radar observations. Canadians have been abucted. The Canadian government has kept much information classified and misrepresented the facts of its activities to the public. A number of courageous investigators have dug into Canadian sightings and some cultist and amateur groups have flourished and died off. As an American (my wife is a Canadian) living in Canada since 1980 and having visited Canada since 1965,1 am aware that many Americans think of Canada as being just like the USA but further north. The languages of the two counties are (leaving out Quebec) generally the same. But there are some very important differences that have a bearing on the UFO question: 1) Canada covers a larger land area than the USA (actually second only to the USSR) but has a population only l/10th that of the USA and most of that is in a narrow band within 200 miles of the US border. Winters are long and harsh. The numer of people per square mile available to. observe UFOs is thus greatly reduced compared with Europe, Asia, the USA etc. 2) Canada has a much smaller military presence than does the USA and the rest of the NATO alliance. 3) Canada did not, until the past 5 years, have anything even close to a Freedom of Information Act. Access to Information is new and does work ($5 per request), but there are many exemptions. Because much of Canada's cultural and political heritage is from the UK, not from the USA, there is much more of a Government-knows- best attitude than in the USA. 4) Canadians, in general, have far more respect for authorities, especially for the Royal Canadian Mounted Police than do Americans. The extensive but very incomplete National Research Council UFO files have very little contamination with what might be described as kook reports. RCMP investigators frequently were involved and people here usually (if not involved in crime) do not lie to the RCMP, and don't think of police as \"pigs.\" Military people are respected and usually are careerists rather than short termers. 5) Because of the great size of the country and the weather, it is comparatively more difficult to have well organized investigative groups. PERSONAL ACTIVITIES On a personal basis, having lectured at dozens of campuses (some 3 times) and to many other groups in 8 of the 10 Canadian provinces and appeared on many radio and TV programs, I can say that there is a great deal of interest in a scientific approach to the UFO problem, coupled as would be expected with a general lack of awareness of the mountain of work done by investigators and organizations such as MUFON. I have had many overflow crowds at my lectures and many columns of favorable newspaper coverage. I have also had my trouble with the major newspaper, the Toronto Globe and Mail, and with Phil Klass's noisy negativist associate, Henry Gordon, who did three separate columns on me in the Toronto Star (Ref. 1), each one loaded with misrepresentations, as one might perhaps expect from a magician member of the self-annointed Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal. At least the Star published portions of two letters in response to the misinformation in Gordon's columns and has carried a large overview article. The Globe and Mail actually lied to the Ontario Press Council which did give me a hearing in my complaint about false statements in a summary front page G&M article. The OPC found against me, however, with 2 of their three counts being demonstrably false. It reminded me of the strong anti-UFO attitude of the Los Angeles Times for many years, a sort of \"Don't bother us with the facts: Our mind is made up. If there were anything to UFOs, we would know about it. We don't know any such thing, and anybody who says there is something to UFOs is some kind of a nut.\" There were sightings in Canada in 1947 as well as much earlier and have been ever since. Of the 853 UFO sightings reported in Ted Bloecher's compilation, \"Report of the UFO Wave of 1947,\" from June and July 1947, 18 were of Canadian origin as observed by a total of 52 witnesses. Judging by other efforts to expand Bloecher's 3"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"compilation, there were many more cases reported in local newspapers but not collected by Bloecher. There were at least 2 publicly acknowledged official investigative efforts: Project Magnet and Project Second Story. A key figure in both was Department of Transport Engineer, Wilbert B. Smith. I never met Smith prior to his untimely death of a brain tumor in the early 1960s, but I have communicated with his wife and met his son and talked to many people who knew him. Also, Arthur Bray has been kind enough to provide copies of a number of items from Smith's files. As with the great majority of Canadian research activities, Smith's work was very much on a shoestring budget. Since an excellent overview of the UFO situation in Canada is presented in the book by Bondarchuk (Ref. 2), I will not duplicate the information he provides. Smith was clearly a serious professional who was awarded Canada's highest broadcasting engineering award, often visited the USA and knew Donald Keyhoe of NICAP and Frank Edwards, as well as having had through the Canadian Embassy an association with Vannevar Bush, who apparently was the key figure in the top secret US UFO effort after the Roswell Incident (Ref. 3,4) in July, 1947. Bush also had headed the Office of Scientific Research and Development during World War II as a kind of Science and Technology Czar, having established the Manhattan Project as well as a myriad of other joint military-industry-university technology projects aimed at winning the war. He also organized and was the first head of the postwar Joint Research and Development Board (JRDB) which later became the RDB, served on the War Council, had headed prewar the National Advisory Committee on Aeronautics (NACA which later became the NASA), had very close ties to James Forrestal, first head of the Department of Defense, and many meetings with presidents Roosevelt, Truman and Eisenhower. His association with MJ-12 member Donald Menzel goes back to 1934, and Bush was Menzel's staunchest defender at Loyalty Hearings held in May 1950. I have elsewhere (Ref. 5) quoted the startling statements from Smith's 3- 4 page Top Secret memo \"Geomag- netics,\" discovered by Canadian Research Mr. X (legal name for a most unusual researcher, sort of a Canadian Charles Fort), but will repeat the key comments here (November 21, 1950): \"I made discreet enquiries through the Canadian Embassy staff in Washington who were able to obtain for me the following information: a) The matter is the most highly classified subject in the United States Government, rating higher even than the H-bomb. b) Flying saucers exist. • c) Their modus operand! is unknown but concentrated effort is being made by a small group headed by Dr. Vannevar Bush. d) The entire matter is considered by the United States authorities to be of tremendous significance.\" Some sceptics have tried to pass Smith off as a kook because of his interest in paranormal phenomena, apparently not knowing that there is quite a file of supporting material..especially classified correspondence with Arnauld Wright and Gordon Cox and other Canadian Government employees. Also I managed to have released under Access to Information the files of the Defense Research Board...roughly the equivalent (on a much much smaller scale) of the US Research and Development Board which was the evolutionary remnant of the Joint Research and Development Board. The DRB had established a committee on UFOs which met on a number of occasions in classified session, strangely at the same time the public was being told that nothing official was being done and that Wilbert Smith's activities were just a hobby as part of his membership in NICAP!! The 300 page DBR file is not for the most part of very great excitement, including newspaper articles and letters in response to public inquiries. It also however, includes a 1.5 page summary of government UFO involvement, dated October 1958. Here are some very provocative items from that history: \"E.A. Bernard (Confidential - declassified May 25, 1984) Defense Research Board. 1. Past History U.S. \"Project Saucer\" was completed about 1950 and it was found desireable to solicit Canadian reports. At the 220th meeting of the JIC (Joint Intelligence Committee) on the 12, April, 1950, UFOs were discussed and the following decisions were reached a) DSI (Directorate of Scientific Intelligence) and DAI (Directorate of Air Intelligence) were to collaborate in preparing a questionnaire to be distributed to field intelligence officers of the three services and the RCMP. b) DAI is to coordinate the investigation arrangements in the field. c) All field reports were to be passed to DSI for official examination on behalf of DND (Department of National Defense). 2. Action by DRB/DSI A tabular record of reports of sightings dating back to 1954...is kept in this office and is classified SECRET. The last entry is a sighting of 8th June 1956. A file is also kept here which contains a multitude of press articles, sightings, etc. DRB file 3800-10-1-1 (3 vols.) contains a large number of sighting reports dating back to 1947. The last report in the DAI files was dated July 1958. DAI did not appear to be aware of earlier policy as explained in paragraphs 2 and 3 above.\" DESTROYED I naturally filed an Access to Information request for the specific items noted. The response, which was prompt, was also very disappointing since it stated that copies of all these items had all been destroyed. From my own background of 14 years work with classified documents I simply do not believe that these were the only'copies but have no way of establishing where the others are, though I am still working on it. I located some of the individuals listed as attending the meetings. A couple of people responded that so far as they were concerned the information"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"was still covered by the Official Secrets act and refused to say any more. I did manage to locate and meet with Dr. Omand Solandt who was the first Chairman of the DRB and sort of the Vannevar Bush of Canada...though much younger. He recalled Wilbert Smith, but denied knowing that there was really a huge U.S. coverup. He serves still on many committees and keeps very busy in retirement. He was not interested in getting back into the UFO controversy. The National Research Council has had an important and • unusual involvement in UFOs since the mid 1960s after Smith's death. On the one hand it has been the official collection agency for public reports and had received thousands from the military, the police, and the general public. However, unlike the U.S. Project-Blue Book, it has had a very low public profile and does practically no investigations on its own. Each report is given a number and filed chronologic- ally on file cards maintained in a small office. One can view the files, usually by appointment, but cannot make copies though notes can be taken. Since about 5 years ago thanks to the efforts of Mr. X and some effort on my part the early files were transferred to the Public Archives and put on microfilm. Each year the 100-200-cases received the previous year are added to the Archives collection where they can be viewed and hard copies made. These are crying out for investigation. Essentially the only effort made by the NRC is to subdivide into \"meteor\" and \"non meteor\" categories. The NRC is interested in the meteor reports and follows up on them in the interest of science. They do nothing about the non-meteors which are, of course, of far more interest to Ufologists. There is no cross filing geography, type of report, whether radar is involved or a landing occurred etc. Two NRC people, Dr. Peter Millman an astronomer and Dr. MacNamara have made public anti- UFO statements. There are no classified sightings in the NRC files though it is clear that the Canadian side of the North American Air Defence Command does make radar observations and does report to HQ NORAD per the terms of JANAP-146 and its successor regulations. There are still in place regulations for military and civilian pilots to make reports of unknown aerial objects, unknown missiles, unknown aircraft, etc. INDIVIDUALS My first contact with Canadian Ufology was way back in 1968 when William K. Allen a teacher of physics in Calgary had the courage to bring me in to speak at the Jubilee Auditorium. Bill kept me busy with the media and we had a crowd of 1200 paying attendees. The profit went to help' Bill's group \"UFO Anonymous\" put out an excellent LP record which included both sounds of UFOs and interviews with witnesses including commercial pilots. Bill is retired and living in Kelowna, B.C. and has done a great deal through the media to make the study of UFOs respectable. John Musgrave had the courage to apply for and accept a grant from the Canada Council to study UFO abductions and toured all over North America in his quest. I was very disappointed in his final report (Ref. 6) and never could understand why it was so negative and in places inaccurate until April, 1987 when John was involved in the CBC TV Man Alive program \"The ET Connection.\" The program which set new standards for careful advance research thanks to Director-Producer David Cherniack, focused on abductions. It turns out John may himself have had an abduction experience when young and seems to be fighting dealing with it at all by trying to pass it and other abduction experiences off as dreams. Apparently if he admits that other actual abductions have occurred, he would have to face up to his own which apparently is too difficult...sort of a classic case of denial. John heads a small group in Edmonton, Alberta. : Arthur Bray of Ottawa, has published two books on UFOs, is an ex- officer and has managed to obtain a portion of the files of Wilbert Smith. Because of his input at the Toronto MUFON Conference in 1982,1 was put on to Dr. Robert Sarbachef whom I was able to locate in Florida, and to visit. Sarbacher was a quite remarkable scientist who served on a number of wartime and post war research committees and was the source of some of Smith's comments about UFOs as quoted above, according to Smith's handwritten notes after the meeting. Sarbacher was a boy genius according to a Saturday Evening Post article and made major contributions to the technical side of winning World War II...I don't know why Arthur hadn't looked for him. His yacht in Palm Beach, Florida, was quite impressive and he was in the phone book as well as in various professional directories. Still active in Canada are people such as Chris Rutkowski of Winnipeg, Manitoba, and employed by the University of Manitoba. Chris publishes The Swamp Gas Journal and has compiled an extensive computerized file of hundreds of Manitoba UFO sightings. He has been involved in various research projects concerned with observations from satellites. Gene Duplantier of Toronto has been a long time distributor of UFO publications. John Magor of British Columbia published a Canadian UFO report for several years and has written at least one book. David Haisell of the Toronto area has also written a book and was an active investigator for several years. There are still active UFO groups in Toronto and Waterloo and Stratford, all in Ontario. Dr.. Don Donderi is a . Professor of Psychology at prestigious McGill University in Montreal and was very active in UFO Quebec as well as courageous enough to introduce me at 2 of my overflow McGill lectures. REFERENCES 1.

ABSTRACT Field data garnered by UFOlogists present the most open-minded observer with contradictory reports, from those of apparent spacecraft landings, to encounters bordering on the magical and mystical. Like the particle-wave duality found in the phenomena of light propagation, UFO phenomena seems to branch into two major classifications: Sensory Experiences and Psychic Experiences. Trying to separate and catalog these reports, as well as the theories and hypotheses that attempt to explain them, results in confusion both for UFOlogists and the public. To give all of the UFO theories and reports a common identification scheme, I have elaborated on Dr. J. Allen Hynek's Close Encounters categories to produce a new and comprehensive classification system that provides a definite place for all conceivable UFO and paranormal events and combinations of events. A Sensory Experience derives from external stimuli, and is one in which the human brain and nervous system process information deriving from all the recognized human senses of sight, smell, touch, taste, and hearing, as well as temperature, balance, muscular position and other known physiological responses. Thus, a sensory event is one that gives rise to the stimuli to which the human system responds. A physical construct is a natural or artificial aggregation of matter and or energy that occurs by processes acceptable to convention- al science. In comparison, ' a Psychic Experience is one in which the human brain and nervous system process 6 information that does not derive from those known and recognized human senses. A psychic event, then, is something that gives rise to the stimuli • to which the \"psychic senses\" respond. A psychic consfrucf, it follows, would be an aggregation of energy or matter formed by unknown processes outside the knowledge of conventional science. With these definitions in hand, the classification table represents a novel category system into which the entire range of UFO reports — landings, occupants, physical encounters, apparitions, abductions, hallucinations, mistaken identifications, mystical beings — can all be fit, in their great and wondrous variety. Examples of each of four categories under both Sensory Experiences and Psychic Experiences serve to demonstrate the utility of the method. IMPROBABLE EVENTS Psychic theories of UFOs offer explanations for UFO experiences in terms of phenomena not yet a part of conventional science. Such theories arose among UFOlogists attempting to formulate one explanation to account for all of the seemingly bizarre, irrational, and \"impossible\" events associated with UFO reports. In the May, 1953, issue of the Journal of the British Interplanetary Society, scientist Arthur C. Clarke speculated that \"...if they come from other planets, it is fairly certain they are not spaceships...they will be something very much more sophisticated.\" In the last twenty-five years other researchers have tended to similar conclusions. Dr. J. Allen Hynek, former Blue Book consultant and Director of the Center for UFO Studies, has said \"There are two senses in which people think UFOs are psychic — one view is that they are created by mental or unconscious projections...A second way is to assume that they are parapsychological, in which case they may very well be real, but they are conforming to a different set of laws.\" (The Edge of Reality, Regnery, Chicago, 1975). The opposing view is stated by David M. Jacobs (Proceedings of the 1976 CUFOS Conference, p.115): \"...it seems absurd to have to construct another universe as a home for UFOs. It seems equally absurd to create an alternate reality or fourth dimension when we do not even know...what comprises the nature of reality.\" Nonetheless, certain aspects of UFO reports seem to be quite strange: religious visions, such as those at Fatima, Portugal, in 1917 which were followed by a sun-like disc seen by believers and atheists alike; encounters with ethereal beings; contact with extraterrestrials by ESP; and the apparently irrational antics of humanoids seen in and around landed UFOs. It is evident that these events, if they are real, must have some aspects which cannot be totally accounted for in conventional scientific terms. To compare the multitudes of psychic theories of UFOs, we define a standard classification system based upon the two basic kinds of UFO experiences: Sensory Experience: This type of experience is one in which the human mind/brain system processes information deriving from the recognized human senses of sight, smell, taste, touch, and hearing, as well as secondary perceptions such as temperature, pressure, balance, vibration, time duration, body position, muscle control, and other known physiological responses. A Sensory Event is one that gives rise to the stimuli to which the known senses respond. Such an event involves the possibility of measurement by instrumentation and of physical effects upon the environment."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"Psychic Experience: This type of experience is one in which the human mind/brain system processes information that does not derive from the known human senses. A Psychic Event is an event that gives rise to stimuli to which the psychic senses respond. These definitions rule out the possibility of instrumentation measurements within the range of existing equipment, as far as is known. A psychic consfrucf is further defined as an aggregation of matter or energy formed by unknown processes not considered possible in conventional science. In the manner of the Close Encounters classifications defined by Dr. J. Allen Hynek, Tables I and II subdivide the two types of UFO experiences into specific categories depending upon the construction and the origin of the events. SE1K In this category fall all of the non- psychic theories of UFO experience. They are exemplified by the Extra- Terrestrial Hypothesis (ETH) which simply states that UFOs are \"nuts and bolts\" mechanical constructions built and piloted by beings from other planets and other star systems. This view is expounded by the major civilian UFO groups, such as APRO, MUFON, NICAP, Ground Saucer Watch, and PSI. Authors Ruppelt, Heard, Jessup, Saunders, and McCampbell have supported this thesis, and until recently, psychic proponents Hynek and Vallee. Other theories in this category include those that speculate upon time machines, living creatures in the sky or space, and some types of natural phenomena. Because SE1K respond to scientific measurement by instrument- ation, they are classified as \"real.\" They also may include atmospheric and celestial phenomena that are mis- interpreted by some witnesses. SE2K The sensory experience of an event psychically constructed by human minds occurs in the literature of parapsychology and may be one TABLE I SENSORY EXPERIENCES Of the First Kind (SE1K): Of the Second Kind (SE2K): Of the Third Kind (SE3K): Of the Fourth Kind (SE4K): 'Sensory Experience, Physical Construct Sensory Experience, Psychic Construct- human origin Sensory Experience, Psychic Construct- alien origin Sensory Experiences, Psychic Construct- natural origin explanation of some UFOs. William Roll, Director of the Psychical Research Foundation, Durham, NC, talks of.such events in his book The Poltergeist (Signet, 1972). His investigations show that the directed forces of the human mind can cause physical events such as moving objects, puncturing skin, or generating lights and sounds. Dr. Hynek alludes to the poltergeist explanation in The Edge of Reality. Jacques Vallee in his precedent- breaking treatise Passport to Magonia (Regnery, Chicago, 1969) mentions a possible hypothetical \"medium in which human dreams can be implemented, and this is the mechanism by which UFO events are generated, needing no superior intelligence to trigger them...It also, naturally, explains the totality of religious miracles as well as ghosts...\" He goes on to refute this theory with another of his own (See PE3K). SE2K may be summarized in the statement by the famous psychologist C.G. Jung, in his analysis Flying Saucers: A Modern Myth of Things Seen in the S/cy (Harcourt Brace, 1959): \"It boils down to nothing less than this: that either psychic projections throw back a radar, echo, or else the appearance of real ejects affords an opportunity for mythological projections.\" SE3K Sensory experiences of events psychically created by alien intelligences are among the most common theories of psychic UFOs. One of the earliest reports of SE3K theories comes from Meade Layne in his 1950 publication Flying Discs--The Ether Ship Mystery and Its Solution (Borderland Sciences Research Associates, San Diego). He feels that UFOs come from a region of existence called the \"Etheric Plane\" which is a psychic realm, but are perceived by humans as real. The earlier quote by Arthur C. Clarke could also point to SE3K, since he suggested that UFOs may not be material bodies. Frank E. Stranges in Danger From the Stars (International Evangelism Crusades, Venice, CA, 1960) feels that supernatural beings or \"angels\" are behind the UFO phenomena, and that they can cause physical damage to humans. A similar view by George Unger in the 1958 book Flying Saucers: Physical and Spiritual Aspects (New Knowledge Books, Sussex, England) considers the real UFOs to be used by supernatural forces not from space. Similar views of events directed by other intelligences may be found in the books of John Keel (The Mothman Prophecies, Signet, 1975; Our Haunted Planet, Fawcett, 1971; and portions of The Eighfh Tower, Signet, 1975.) Part of Keel's theories involve \"program- ming\" radiation from space that directs the activities of the human race. As a matter of comment, the boundary between SE3K and SE1K may change as time goes on, for research may find that there are strange and unusual methods of construction, propulsion, and communication. What we now consider \"psychic\" may one day be common technology. SE4K Sensory experiences of naturally-"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"occurring psychic events are seldom theorized. The first author who apparently wrote on this was C. Maxwell Cade, in \"A Long, Cool Look At Alien Intelligence,\" (Flying Saucer Review, March/April 1968). Cade theorized that UFOs and poltergeists could be caused by influences of unknown radiations planned by extraterrestrial intelligences, or by natural stochastic (i.e., random) processes. (The iconoclastic writer Charles Fort wrote about similar- sounding theories in The Book of the Damned, before the era of modern UFOlogy, but it is not clear if he spoke of psychic origins.) A modern look at SE4K comes from Persinger and Lafreniere in their 1977 book Space-Time Transients and Unusual Events (Nelson-Hall, Chicago). After classifying Fortean phenomena across the United States into types of events, timing of events, and geographical location, the authors specualte that the interactions of stellar gravity . shock waves and various natural electric and magnetic fields of the earth produce UFOs and other strange happenings. In their view, the manifestation of unusual events is produced by these perturbations acting upon the human system. Thus there have been actual creation of anomalous artifacts, fossils, animals, and UFOs. Some of their other explanations are discussed in PE2K. PSYCHIC EXPERIENCES The reported intensities and varieties of UFO.sensory effects swamp the normal human senses. The dazzling lights, sounds, smells, tastes, vibrations, heat, loss of memory, paralysis, and inputs to all the other senses, make if not surprising that latent or subtle psychic senses would also be affected. The following section is an overview of the major theories that explain UFOs in terms still outside of conventional science. PE1K This category can be called \"psychological.\" The phenomena reported are generated internally to the witness and although real to that 8 TABLE II PSYCHIC EXPERIENCES Of the First Kind (PE1K): Of the Second Kind (PE2K): Of the Third Kind (PE3K): Of the Fourth Kind (PE4K): Psychic Experience, Internal Origin Psychic Experiences, Psychic Construct- human origin Psychic Experience, Psychic Construct- alien origin Psychic Experience, Psychic Construct- .natural origin person, cannot be perceived by others. Thus, dreams, hallucinations, altered states of consciousness, hypnosis, drug experiences, and other delusions fall into the category of PE1K. Although such reports may be of interest to psychologists, further research would only delve deeper into the mind and psychology of the witness, and not to any conclusions about the external world perceived by others. In other words, these events are not \"real.\" , This explanation has. been put forth by most of the UFO \"de- bunkers,\" from Schopfer (The Flying . Saucers: Yes or No?, Stuttgart, Walter Hadecke Verlag, 1955), through Gardner, Fads and Fallacies in the Name of Science (Dover, 1957), up to protions of Grinspoon and Persky in 1972 (\"Psychiatry and UFO Reports,\" in UFOs: A Scientific Debate, Norton, New York). PE2K The psychic perception of psychic events created by human intelligence account for a wide range of experiences, from telepathic communication to out-of-body travels, to psychic readings, to haunting investigations (Andrews, Beyond Reality Magazine, June 1978, for example), and most other areas of parapsychology. The spiritualist literature, for example, is replete with reports of communication with humans now living in another plane of existence. Dr.. Hermann Oberth, the famed rocket scientist^ changed his \"nuts-and-bolts\" SE1K outlook (\"Flying Saucers Come From a Distant World,\" American Weekly, Oct. 24, 1954) to PE2K after communication with a spirit through a psychic medium (Kdtechismus der Uraidem, Ventla-Verlag, 1966). He now believes that earth serves as a testing place for the soul, which then continues life on other planets after physical ; death. A less spiritual view of PE2K is taken by Loren Coleman and Jerome Clark . in The Unidentified: Notes Toward Solving the UFO Mystery (Warner Paperbak Library 1975). In their \"Laws of Para-ufology,\" they state that the UFO mystery is primarily symbolic, that the objective manifestations are psychic creations for the human brain: \"Existing only temporarily, they are at best quasi- physical.\" Again, these authors feel that the psychic component of the collective unconscious creates psychic events that are perceptible to those psychic senses. In this .manner, then, many psychic humans may experience the psychic creation of other humans. PE3K This category, psychic perception of psychic events created by aliens, is the largest grouping under \"Psychic Theories of UFOs.\" The intelligences are postulated to be on other planets, under the earth's surface, in other times, and in other dimensions. Theories have exhausted nearly every conceivable relationship that may exist among mankind and every other thinking thing in all of time and space. We will briefly outline some of these aspects of psychic UFOs. Telepathic Contact With"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"Exfraterresfria/s--According to Mitch Martin in Fate Magazine, (September 1958--\"Space Travelers in 1870?\"), Martians and earthfolk communicated from Massachusetts to the Red Planet between 1860 and 1873 by psychic means. A long history of such contacts has ensued, from Corinne Heline's America's Invisible Guidance (New Age Press, Los Angeles, 1949), to the many publications of the Aetherius Society and other religious contactee groups. Scientific Ufologists have long since refused to take such claims very seriously, primarily because the information content in the messages is the usual \"Man must repent and stop nuclear testing\" variety, or else a collection of religious exhortations. (In short, no- useful data has ever been received from the \"Space Brothers;\" we would have at least expected foreknowledge of the rings of Uranus or the fact that Mercury rotates on its own rotates on its own axis.) Psychic Origin of UFOs- The often inexplicable appearance of UFOs has led to the most serious theories of the psychic nature of the objects themselves. One such event is the 1917 Fatima, Portugal experience: shepherd children saw and spoke to a woman in a glowing ball of light. Then later, as prophesied by the woman, a brilliant disc broke through clouds and dried the clothing of a rain-soaked crowd of 60,000 persons. (See Walsh, Our Lady of Fatima, MacMillan, New York, 1947). From the viewpoint of Ufology.a PE3K and a SE3K occurred (Ribera, \"What Happened at Fatima?\", Flying Saucer Review, March/April, 1964). Such experiences must be accounted for in any such UFO theory. Dr. Hynek's views of psychic UFOs were discussed earlier. His colleague, Jacques Vallee (Passport to Magonia) further speculates that \"...(UFOs could be explained) if we could hypothesize mental entities, which would be simultaneously perceptible to groups of independent witnesses,\" and that \"we could also imagine that for centuries some superior intelligence has been projecting into our environment... various artificial objects whose creation is a pure form of art.\" Then he concludes that \"...a hundred or a thousand such theories could be enumerated at very little expense, and every one of them could serve as the basis for a very nice new myth or religion....\" His own version of psychic UFOs, however, does call for accommodating historical accounts of apparitions, the Celtic fairy faiths, nineteenth century \"airships,\" and modern UFO appearances, saying that \"the mechanisms that have generated these various beliefs are identical\" (and presumably of psychic origin.) Another of John Keel's theories from The Eighth Tower is that a senile supercomputer left over from an ancient age produces psychic manifestations of monsters, artifacts, and UFOs to prevent us from finding its physical location. A similar view is propounded by writer Brad Steiger in his booksMysteries of Time and Space (Dell, 1976) and Gods of Aquarius: UFOs and the Transformation of Man (Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, 1976). He proposes that mankind is engaged in a \"Reality Game\" with the UFO intelligences, in a symbiotic relationship. Once we understand that there is a game, he concludes, we will understand what the rules of the game are, and that will transform us into a cosmic consciousness. As Steiger summarizes in Project Blue Book (Ballantine Books, 1976), the effect of psychic theories on the study of UFOs has been profound: \"...the course had been set for a New Ufology devoted to understanding the mechanisms of belief rather than perpetuating the beliefs generated by those mechanisms.\" That states the present case for PE3K. PE4K Psychic perception of naturally- occurring psychic events form several of the \"Low-Probability Explanations\" for anomalous events in the previously- quoted work of Persinger and Lafreniere. Postulating an interactive relationship between the natural energy fields of the earth arid the living creatures of it, the concept of a \"geopsyche\" is presented. The geopsyche arises when a uniformity of thought or belief happens among humans, and the resulting fears and neuroses modulate the behaviour of the race. Perturbations of the electromagnetic fields of the earth could also produce psychic manifestations among humans. PSYCHIC SUMMARY Many references to psychic aspects of UFOs are summarized in the U.S. Air Force Publication AFOSR 68-1656 (1969) by Lynn Catoe, entitled UFOs and Related Subjects: An Annotated Bibliography. The psychic theories of UFOs speak for themselves; frustration in capturing an object or capturing the imagination of the scientific community seem to have given rise to much of the new direction in Ufology. Three more quotations would seem to be in order. From Flying Saucer Occupants (Signet, 1967), Jim and Coral Lorenzen say that there are two choices in UFO theories: 1.) The objects and their \"operators\" are physically real... or 2.) The population of this world is falling victim to a particularly insidious and apparently contagious mental disease which generates hallucinations involving specific types of airships and humanoids. This disease seems to be spreading.\" From Passport to Magonia, Vallee: \"The behavior of nonhuman visitors to our planet, or the behavior of a superior race coexisting with us on this planet, would not necessarily appear purposeful to a human observer. Scientists who brush aside UFO reports because 'obviously intelligent visitors would not behave like that' simply have not given serious thought to the problem of nonhuman intelligence.\" And finally, from Arthur C. Clarke, circa 1954: \"Any technology sufficiently advanced over one's own will appear to be magic.\" MUFON 103 Oldtowne Rd. Seguin, Texas 78155"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"CURRENT MEDIA ATTITUDES By Jim Speiser Jim Speiser is MUFON State Section Director for Arizona Throughout the forty-year history of the current UFO era, much of the public's perception of the phenomenon has been shaped by the press and media coverage it has received. Over the years that coverage has ranged in tone from unashamed hysteria to downright ridicule, sometimes both concurrently. Lately, nowever, the trend has been progressively more cynical, perhaps owing to the increasing pervasiveness of \"organized skepticism\" and the rise of such groups as CSICOP. Early on, debunkers such as Philip Klass correctly decried the media's uncharacteristic lack of attention to \"the other side of the story\" in dealing with reports of paranormal phenomena in general and UFOs in particular. Now, however, reporters seem to routinely consult with astronomers, satellite tracking facilities and even the debunkers themselves when filing a UFO story. On its face, this journalistic balance is commendable, of course, but there is a tendency to let the skeptics have the last word, as if to provide a \"happy ending\" to the plot to invade our scientific equilibrium. Gould reporters' own cynical attitudes be coloring their coverage of the UFO phenomenon? In an attempt to gauge the current outlook of the media toward the subject, I recently touched base with a group of journalists that meet \"online\", in a nationwide computer forum called CompuServe. In an electronic message, I posed a series of questions designed to delve into the mindset of the American press vis-a-vis the elusive UFO. QUESTIONS In composing the message, I sought answers to the following: 1) How are mainstream UFOlogists viewed by the press? Have we succeeded in separating the hard science from the cult aspect of the phenomenon? 2) Is the media getting all the facts? Are they making an effort to do so, or is the subject considered so overworked that even the most superficial details are recorded grudgingly? Are the skeptics and debunkers considered the final word? 3) Is there a mpre-or-less universal, tacit policy of downplaying UFO stories, in order to avoid comparison with the much-reviled supermarket tabloids? Many have bemoaned the paucity of in-depth reporting on the so-called Cosmic Watergate, the thousands of pages of documents released through the Freedom of Information Act. If ever there was a carrot on a stick for the American media, the FOIA documents seemed to be it; yet no Woodward/ Berstein-style expose' has been forthcoming. However, it occurs to me that \"no news is bad news\" in the business of journalism, and if such an inquisition had been undertaken, yet had turned up nothing of value, the fact would quite likely never have surfaced. \",60 Minutes\" is not in the habit of reporting what it has not found. So another of my intentions was to find out if such an investigative project had indeed been undertaken, only to be shelved when it proved fruitless. The CompuServe Journalism Forum provides an excellent glimpse behind-the-scenes at some of the attitudes and personalities that shape what we see on our TV screens and in our newspapers. The 2000 members represent a respectable cross-section of the journalism community, from newspaper editors to photographers to network news reporters. While the responses I received to my message cannot be considered comprehensive, I believe they provide a good thumbnail sketch of how ufology looks in the mirror of American culture, the media. Some of the indications: FINDINGS 1) There is indeed a tendency to avoid in-depth UFO stories for. fear of being tarred with the National Enquirer brush. \"The more in-depth the story got, the more harebrained the station or paper might seem,\" said one member. \"Don't get me wrong — I don't necessarily go along with that. I'm just stating what I believe to be fact.\" 2) Perhaps as a result of (1), the cults and kooks are still getting the bulk of the press, and seem to be inextricably associated with the phenomenon in general. The first response to my inquiry was from a reporter who complained of regular calls from a man who claimed that aliens were invading people's bodies at a nearby church. Other members claimed it was difficult to tell the kooks from the serious investigators. A radio newsman told of an interview he had done with a skeptic and a supposedly mainstream ufologist. He claimed that the ufologist, Dale Goudie, turned out to be a \"fanatic\" who charged the skeptic with being an \"idiot\" and working for the government. (Upon reviewing a tape of the interview provided by Goudie, I found no such invective.) 3) The reporters are not getting all the facts. My inquiry revealed that a reporter for Channel 5 in New York, who had covered the story of the Hudson Valley UFOs and concluded that it was all a hoax, had never even seen the home videos made of either the object or the flight of planes! (This situation, at least, has been rectified, and I am awaiting the reporter's comments on the.tape I sent him.) 4) My request for information on 10"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"UFO investigations that hadn't made it to the airwaves drew a blank. Either it hasn't been done, or these professionals didn't know about it. Which brings me to ... 5) My faith in the American media is such that I have never subscribed to the theory that the press is \"in on\" the Cosmic Watergate at any level. There may be a pervasive fear of the UFO story in management circles, but I believe it is based purely on image considerations, and not on some unseen pressure from above. I saw nothing in the CompuServe exchange to convince me otherwise. Not all of the vibes in the exchange were negative, and there was at least one useful, positive suggestion: \"Stay away from buzzwords like UFO and Flying Saucer. In my mind, they instantly conjure up memories of the folks who swear they were whisked to the planet Twilo. for an all-expenses- paid weekend. When 1 hear words like SETI, however, I'm a whole lot less skeptical and a whole lot more interested. [I] think your job is to shift people into a new serious mode of thinking about the subject if you're going to get editors, viewers and readers to take you seriously.\" 1987 is shaping up to be the year of the UFO — not so much in|terms of sightings, but in terms of the amount oi public attention that will be paid the subject, through books, talk shows, symposia, mini-series, and other mass media events. The press is the major conduit through which much information will reach the public and, rightly or wrongly, it is the press' attitude that will shape the public's view of our endeavors. Public opinion in turn determines funding for future work in the field. Hence, it is vital that the press receive an adequate education on UFOs. Judging from the responses gleaned from the CompuServe correspondence, we have our work cut out for us. SUPPORT GROUPS: A PROPOSAL By Ann Druffel Ann Druffel is a frequent Journal contributor and co-author with D. Scott Rogo of The Tujunga Canyon Contacts Recent publication of numerous \"abductee\" and \"entity contact\" reports (1) in the MUFON UFO Journal, FSR, and other sources has made plain what many ufologists have suspected for years — that the \"abductee\" syndrome and other types of purported \"alien contact\" have been proliferating beyond the ability of the field to properly investigate all surfacing cases. Now, in April and May 1987, the publication of Communion by Whitley Strieber and Intruders by Budd Hopkins has led to heightened public awareness of the possibility that members of the human race are being contacted rather frequently by intelligences which are, in witnesses' judgment, in one way or another related to UFO phenomena. Books like Communion and Intruders, however, although written by knowledgeable and talented authors, present a skewed picture of the situation, because they fail to include samples from the whole field of \"abductee\" and \"entity contact\" reports. Since 'they concentrate, necessarily, on cases where the witnesses are rational and believable, they make almost no mention of the fact that there is a vast overlay of cases where witnesses, because of varying degrees of emotional damage, have trouble presenting their stories in objective and/or believable form. The \"best,\" most believable cases have the good fortune of documentation and publication, but what happens to numerous similar cases? Many of the witnesses are just as rational, they suffer just as much from frustration and anger, and they, too, long for answers. And yet not much is being done to help them. GROUPS It is advisable; first, to attempt to separate abductee and entity contact cases into various \"groupings.\" This technique will help explain the plethora of individuals who report such • experiences and bring about a better understanding of this article's premise. Of course, groupings of this sort are difficult to make, since each individual is different, but certain generalizations can be made. While such groupings would probably vary from researcher to researcher, those below are derived from twenty years of personal experience with abductee and contact cases. During that time, I have investigated and documented at least two dozen cases, many of which have been published in the literature. 2 , 3 I have also investigated, to a greater or less degree, over one hundred other \"contact\" and \"abduction\" cases. The groupings derived from these files are as follows: GROUP ONE: These are witnesses reporting contact or UFO abduction who appear to be rational, honest, and socially productive. They are generally cooperative and open to investigation, but desire anonymity to protect their privacy. They usually have stable work lives and satisfying familial relationships. Group One individuals seem to be describing \"real\" 4 experiences to the best of their ability. They do not readily seek \"explanations\" from outsiders, and therefore are relatively free from emotional damage sustained through ridicule and disbelief by family, friends, and others. Although some tend to interpret their \"visitor\" episodes in the light of their own philosophical or religious understanding, they do not 11"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"insist that their interpretation is the only one possible. They remain open to futher hypothesizing as to the \"source.\" They benefit by reassurance and support by experienced investigators/ researchers, and sometimes this is vital to prevent them from allowing the experience(s) to \"take over their lives.\" After a time, with the proper support, they assimilate the incident(s) into their lives, retaining minimum, if any, anxiety about the Phenomenon. Care should be taken by investigators to avoid letting their own hypotheses about the source, nature, and mdtive(s) of the UFO Phenomenon influence the opinions of such witnesses, although general discussion of various theories and hypotheses is not out-of-line. Group One witnesses are often metaphysically-minded, regularly practicing meditation and/or prayer. Some report their experiences as \"positive\" or \"partially positive,\" and if they feel \"favored\" or \"chosen,\" they do not stress this point. A good example of a Group One abudctee is \"Emily,\" as described in the book, Tujunga Canyon Contacts. 5 GROUP TWO: This group, also, seems to be describing \"real\" events. Often, their experiences have occurred years prior, and they never managed to find a suitable source to report it. Most attempted, shortly after the occurrence, to describe the episode(s) to family and friends but met with ridicule and disbelief. As a result, many sustained considerable emotional damage. It is possible that their psychological makeups are rather more fragile than the sturdier mindsets of Group One individuals. The emotional damage sustained seems over and above any direct trauma the UFO event itself may have caused. EMOTIONAL DAMAGE Group Two individuals benefit greatly from contact with experienced, objective investigators, if careful support techniques are used. Often overt empathy and .compassion must be employed for a time, to help them overcome the psychological damage sustained. The investigator must be aware that Group Two individuals can 12 become dependent on supportive techniques, however, and these must be gradually eased as the \"healing\" process occurs. Group Two individuals, like Group One persons, are generally friendly and cooperative and if they \"drain\" energy and time from investigators, they often recognize this and attempt to remedy the situation. In many cases, Group Two individuals' emotional damage has caused breakup in family relationships, including divorce. They tend to change jobs frequently and/or to have difficulty holding positions which pay satisfactory wages/salary. They tend, also to have formed rather firm notions as to the source, nature, and motive(s) of the entities with whom they have reportedly had contact. Most of them reject objective discussion of alternate hypotheses, feeling that their own opinions satisfy their needs. If they consider their experiences in any respect \"positive\" or \"partially positive,\" they often feel \"chosen\" and do not hesitate to inform others of this fact. A few of this group, however, remain mystified and actively seek advice, \"knowledge,\" opinions from investigators. If they have not arrived at conclusions regarding the Phenom- enon's \"source,\" they tend to grasp at hypotheses or opinions offered by investigators. It is of utmost importance that any discussion of \"source,\" motives, etc. be kept on an extremely objective level, and every effort made to help Group Two witnesses form their own opinions in the light of their own \"contact\" experiences. These individuals can often be philosophically or religiously oriented, but tend to despair or anxiety rather than finding help through prayer and/or meditation. An example of a Group Two individual is O.K., who lives in the Los Angeles area. Although ostensibly desiring anonymity, he openly speaks of his experiences at length with other persons who are ignorant, of the Phenomenon, thereby tending to bring about continued ridicule and disbelief. Although basically objective about his encounter, he tends to relate peripheral events which are highly subjective and sometimes \"off the wall.\" In addition to rather severe neurotic behavior in some areas of his life, he has had periods of hospitalization following psychotic episodes, from which he recovers quite rapidly. Being an intelligent and professionally-skilled person, he has researched and documented many facets of his own encounters. All in all, he has managed to put his life back together irvah acceptable way. He uses metaphysical and philosophical techniques as support aids in crises. GROUP THREE: These individ- uals appear extremely damaged — emotionally, mentally and psychically — to a much greater degree than Group Two described above. Although their stories may sometimes appear very similar to Group One and Group Two, their general behavior is consistently neurotic and often psychotic. Their family/acquaintance relationships are rocky or absent altogether. One of the important purposes of their lives seem to be to make logical sense of the \"contact\" experiences they have allegedly undergone. It is feasible to assume that they were already emotionally unstable at the time of their \"encounters,\" if, indeed any type of \"real\" contact ever actually took place. Group Three individuals sometimes manage to appear normal, well-controlled, and rational upon first contact, but very soon are recognizable as severely damaged personalities. It is possible to work with Group Three individuals, documenting and investigating their alleged encounters, but such work is draining on the emotional and physical energy of the investigators. The members of this group are cooperative to a degree, but many of their statements are impossible to verify by reason of highly subjective content. There is little evidence that they rely on metaphysics, meditation, or . any other personal supportive technique to relieve the problems caused by their \"contact\" experiences. They seem to be driven by compulsive behavior and express anger against those who question their statements. An example of Group Three is B.C., divorced with a small child. She is unemployed (though at the time of the abduction encounter was gainfully employed). She moves frequently from f,"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"city to city. Intelligent and extremely articulate, B.C. claims that her experience .included detailed observation of the UFO propulsion system. Although her sketches of the system were regarded by a psychiatric consultant as a deliberate \"puzzle\" perpetrated by her (a common psychotic maneuver), a scientific UFO research group in the Los Angeles area was interested enough to obtain additional technical details from her. Following this, she experienced an apparent paranoid episode in which she accused the scientists of \"stealing\" the . propulsion information. GROUP FOUR: These individuals seem to be basically psychotic individuals who have most probably hallucinated or imagined their reported \"contact\" experiences. The content of their stories, however, may not, at least . upon first contact, differ in any significant degree from Goup Two and Group Three, but they can be recognized almost always by their rushed speech and disconnected thoughts. Their stories are almost always extremely complex. They appear to believe their own stories but many are, in all probability, subconsciously lying. There remains the possibility, however, that a \"real\" contact lies at the core of their statements, but that the details have been hopelessly embellished. As a result, even though there may be grains of truth in their stories, it is never time- efficient to try to investigate or document them. . • .Group Fpur individuals are extremely hard to deal with.'If efforts are made to investigate their claims — for at first contact, they may appear to fall within Group Three or Group Two — the investigators soon: find themselves being^draihed,of physical, emotional and. psychical' energies. Group Four'persons are, in essence, \"psychic vampires,\" constantly seeking support, reassurance, compassion, and above all, .belief.  .': They , are almost always lonely people, owing, perhaps, to .their extreme need to \"tell their story. \"They tend to \"repeat portions of their stories at every opportunity, even to the same listener; .Attempts to objectively, discuss their \"experiences\" with them are of no avail. It is advisable for researchers who encounter these individuals to pull back from any contact they may have begun with them, for the sake of their own emotional well-being. Group Four individuals should be referred, if possible, to professional psychologists and psychiatrists interested in the UFO Phenomenon, not only because of the degree of expertise needed but also because such professional researchers can at least be paid for their time! An example of Group Four residing in the Los Angeles area, R:C., reported numerous types of UFO and paranormal episodes. The contend of the reported incidents changed from interview to interview because different aspects of the \"experiences\" were stressed at different times. R.C. claimed contact with white, glowing entities, which she identified as \"angels\" and \"the Divine Mother.\" She insisted that \"the Divine Mother\" is angered for not being recognized by Christendom as \"part of the Trinity,\" and had frustrated local priests with her arguments. She also reported poltergeist effects, white disc-shaped manifest- ations, and claimed to have direct knowledge that porpoises (dolphins) desired contact with the human race and that she was capable of establishing communication with them. Significant- ly, when R.C. was offered a chance to be interviewed by a parapsychological research lab which is interested in dolphin-human communication, she did not follow through. HOAXES GROUP FIVE: These \"witnesses\" encompass a small number (in my experience. possibly one or two percent), who are hoaxing or consciously lying about having abduction/encounter experiences. Their reasons for doing so may range from prank-playing to a pathological need for attention. This type, if not immediately recognized, can take valuable research time before contact is cut off. An example of this sort is Y.G., who claims that, through continuing telepathic contact with \"space entities,\" he has the knowledge to produce a working model of an anti-gravity propulsion system similar to that used by some UFOs. Although researchers in So. California have offered to look at his work and even to assist him in designing circuitry (at his request), he has never followed through, and it has become evident over a period of two years that Y.G. has given false information as to his profession, his job status, and other details of his life. Y.G.'s reasons for persisting in his embellishments and untruths is not yet clear. GROUP SIX: this group may be large or small — little is known about it and very little has been published in UFO literature concerning individuals of this type. These are fully rational, truthful, and productive persons who have reported experiences highly suggestive of close proximity to UFO phenomena/occupants. However, they differ from other abductees/contactees in that they have been able to fend off the contacts through the use of various methods, described below. I have only three examples of Group Six in my files. One involves J.M., who as a young woman, three months pregnant with her first child, experienced hearing a loud, high- pitched \"whirring\" sound in the middle of the night. J.M.'s spouse slept through the episode in spite of her efforts to awaken him. There seems to be a memory/time lapse associated with the event, since J.M. cannot remember going back to bed after her vain attempt to locate the source of the sound. A perusal of the neighborhood the next day revealed the sound was not perceived by people in nearby residences. An hypnotic session with a professional medical hypnotherapist failed to break through the amnesia block. In later years, J.M. experienced repeated encounters with apparent \"bedroom visitors,\" as did the other two Group Six witnessses. These \"visitors,\" and accompanying paralysis, were fought off by these Group Six individuals using varying methods, including mental struggle/meditative techniques, and prayer. Could individuals in this group be the \"missing link\" we are searching for in stemming the tide of proliferating abductions and 13"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"other unpleasant encounters with UFO entities? Aside from this interesting question, (which may be treated more fully in a future article), another serious problem must be addressed. We long ago passed the point where there were enough experienced persons to investigate the ever-increasing numbers of contact/abduction reports. In view of the fact that abduction- scenarios and entity visitation experiences are proliferating rapidly in the Southern California area (as elsewhere), I have for several years felt the need for \"halfway houses\" for the more severely damaged individuals, and regular group support meetings for those less affected 6 . GROUP SUPPORT At the very least, some communities should have weekly, bi- weekly, or monthly meetings led by experienced individuals who understand the difficulties UFO \"abductees\" and \"entity contactees\" 7 are going through. At these meetings, Group One and selected Group Two individuals could discuss their experiences, compare them with other victims' stories, and obtain group support in incorporating the experience(s) into their lives in as sane and comfortable a manner as possible. If possible, the support group leaders should be reimbursed for their time. Under no circumstances should any leader attempt to influence the personal thinking of any witnesses as to the nature, source, or motives of their \"visitors.\" Since witnesses to such phenomena are the only ones who have had (possible) personal contact with UFO intelligences, they should be considered as the \"experts,\" in this aspect at least. The leader's role should be strictly supportive and guiding, while the group itself helps its members in adjustment to more normal lives. Also crucial to this group support idea is the ability to verify and document physical evidence — be it scars on witnesses or (the often-reported but elusive) \"implants\" in brains! Also badly needed are the services of doctors, hypnotherapists, and psychologists to evaluate abduction/ 14 contact witnesses as they surface. Mere recounting of such experiences in the literature does not serve any real purpose anymore, other than to demonstrate how numerous these cases are. In support groups, the separate classes of victims, as described above, should be judiciously separated from each other. Groups One and Two should never have to spend their time listening to the endless recountings of Group Four, for example. Group Three is an especially dicey group, which should probably not be exposed to any other group, just as Group Six should not be included in Groups One or Two lest their statements corrupt possible recall, hypnotic or otherwise. And Groups Three and Four, of course, should have the benefit of referral to psychologists and/or psychiatrists, if possible, since they would not likely benefit from the more rational, self- guiding Groups One and Two. Groups One and Two persons would be the most likely to benefit from support therapy. Some of the former have already integrated their experience(s) into their lives and do not need group support. For many, occasional contact with an interested researcher suffices for most of their needs. However, members of Group One, if willing, might serve as assistant leaders (or leaders, if professionally qualified) for other Class One victims who are still searching for adjustment in their lives. I have used this technique informally for several years in this area, referring rational, stable individuals who state they have had abduction experiences to other Group One abductees who have volunteered to do this work on a one-to-one basis, provided the persons referred are the type who need merely to talk out their experiences in a sensible way. Selected Group Two persons could be judiciously added to Group One sessions, where they could learn to incorporate healing techniques and understanding of the Phenomenon's commonality into their own lives. In fact, there is great potential, with proper guidance, for many Group Two persons to become Group One witnesses, with the passage of time. And let us be positive about it and say that Group Four and Five individuals could, in time, be similarly assisted. The author would appreciate feedback and input. from Journal readers. At this writing attempts are being made to set up regular group support meetings in the Los Angeles area, based on the combined ideas of researchers with special interest in this , aspect of the UFO Phenomenon.

Scott Grain, Jr. Observations of large-sized UFOs appear to be making a comeback lately, with reports coming from Alaska, Canada and Pennsylvania. The first and most widely publicized incident occurred on November 17, 1986, when Capt. Kenjyu Terauchi and his crew claimed to have observed a huge walnut-shaped UFO as they flew their JAL Boeing 747 over Alaska. The craft was described by Terauchi as \"two times bigger than an aircraft carrier,\" and continued to pace their airliner despite a 360-degree turn and a drop in altitude from 35,000 feet to 31,000 feet. Although the UFO was observed visually and by ground radar, the FAA concluded the UFO was an \"unexplained split image of the JAL Boeing 747 and not a separate object.\" The FAA does not explain why the UFO appeared on the plane's weather radar, why it took six weeks to come to the \"split-image\" conclusion and why three excellent pilots visual observation is not seriously considered as a reliable recollection of what they saw.

On the night of February 7, 1987, Carl McCurdy was driving east on Route 322, one-half mile from Potters Mills, when he and two other witnesses say they saw a large oval-shaped object suspended several hundred feet in the air. It was shortly after 11:00 PM EST, when Carl and Audrey McCurdy of Spring Mills, and their friend, Jackie Bowersox, were driving home from a basketball game in State College, when in the sky they saw this huge, solid- looking object, with a string of lights around it's outer perimeter. The object was described by Audrey as the \"size of a football field,\" and was encircled by bright lights that were \"beaming down, (with) enough light to make the mountainside seem like daylight.\" (It may be interesting to note that a similar sighting, that was saucer-shaped, lights around its perimeter, and the \"size of a football field,\" was reported on October 23, 1984, by Melvin Morrissey of Tyrone, PA, only 40 miles from this sighting., Details of that encounter appeared in the December 1984 issue of the MUFON Journal.) The three witnesses watched the object for less than a minute. They were driving on a four-lane highway and could not pull over because of the high snow, but did manage to turn around and come back to the site two-and-a- half minutes later. The object was gone and the area was pitch black. The witnesses did not get a chance to see how the UFO left the site. RADAR A third encounter involving an enormous UFO was witnessed by a pilot, first officer, and stewardess on May 16, 1987, during a Canadian Air International flight 157, enroute between Toronto and Winnipeg. Details of the incident were attained by Canadian UFO expert, Stanton Friendman, who became aware of the sighting through UFO investigator Chris Rutkowski. Rick Olsen, 31, was flying a Boeing 737 at 31,000 feet, when his on board Primus 90 weather radar picked up an object 5-6 times the size of a jumbo jet streaking across the sky at 5400 miles- per-hour. The first officer first noticed a huge return on the radar screen at a distance of 50 miles, as the plane was flying 30 miles north of Thunder Bay, Ontario. Picking up a return this size was quiet unusual, since the radar system is designed to record storms and only large aircraft at close range (under 20 miles) on its screen. When jumbo aircraft do appear (747's, DC-10's and LlOll's), they usually appear as a small green dot. \"This return indicated something six times the size of a 747, about the size of an aircraft carrier,\" Olsen reported. The object appeared on the radar screen as bright red in the middle, with what looked like green \"wings.\" The UFO appeared to be flying at approximately the same altitude and roughly the same direction as the 737, at about 15° to the right of the plane. The object was observed on radar for about four minutes, before it went off the scope. The crew made various adjustments to the radar system to insure it was working properly. They determined it was. The weather was hazy and the crew was not close enough to make a visual observation. Toronto Air Control and NORAD were contacted to see if they could confirm the radar target, as reported by Olsen. The answer was negative because of the haze in the atmosphere. Captain Olsen has 21 years flying experience, and has been a commercial pilot for 15 years. Although it may be a coincidence, these three UFO reports were made within a six-month period, almost equally spaced, three months apart. There were at least three primary witnesses in each encounter, and all the descriptions involved extremely large craft. Although I did not check any UFO data banks for like reports during this time frame, it may be interesting to find out if any other countries have had similar reports between November 1986 and May 1987.

MAGNETIC PROPULSION For many years, people have laughed at the theories of some UFOlogists concerning the possibility of magnetic propulsion. However, this method of movement may now be possible (under some conditions) using new superconducting materials. Several recent articles have appeared on the subject. One, in the Columbus Dispatch (August 9, 1987), shows an aspirin-sized superconducting chip floating like a UFO. The chip is made of yttrium, barium, copper, and oxygen (Yl Ba2Cu3O7). It was cooled to-300F and, when held over a refrigerator magnet for a few seconds, it hovered. The professor, doing the experiment, explained that the chip was able to float on a magnetic field created by persistent electric currents generated by the magnet. If kept cool, the chip could float perpetually. A reason for this ability is that the chip"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"retains an electric charge, unlike normal wire, in which the charge will gradually diminish. The same experiment had been performed years before, but using materials in closed tanks cooled to less than minus 400 degrees. Thus, there is no longer any reason to laugh. Perhaps it would be a good idea to go over information about possible UFO composition, such as analysis of possible UFO fragments, and search for evidence of superconducting properties. Also, statements such as: \"Research along these lines has been complicated by the complete absence of identifiable wings, propellers, jets, or other conventional methods of propulsion and guidance, as well as a total lack of metallic wiring, vacuum tubes, or similar recognizable components,\" (MAJESTIC - 12, MUFON UFO JOURNAL, July 1987), may not be as ludicrous (in regard to magnetic propulsion, not anything else) as they appear. Also, the assumption that UFOs should produce a radar return has frequently been used to question possible visual UFO sightings, where there should be a radar return but none existed (The Skeptical Inquirer 11:322- 326, 1987). However, one important aspect of Stealth technology is to produce a radar-proof craft and work is underway to develop anti-radar coatings. Other work is underway to devise ways to make combat planes less visually conspicuous. -Irene Scott MUFON Consultant MEDIA POLICY GUIDELINES In order to strengthen the credibility of UFO-related pursuits, the following guidelines are strongly recommended for all members representing MUFON to the media. I. Providing Public Information as an Organizational Representative A.) Any public presentations or media appearances should be limited to the UFO subject. While paranormal or metaphysical areas may possibly have some bearing on individual UFO case reports, it is nonproductive to present varied subject matter to the public. Further, an impression of inextricable ties between UFO research and other esoteric pursuits serves to confuse the audience and erode the UFO researcher's credibility. B.) Providing inaccurate, unverified or incomplete information to the public or media (print and electronic) should be avoided. C.) Public speakers should be prepared with factual evidence concerning specific UFO cases and/or particular aspects of the subject. Especially in radio/television and newspaper interviews, it is crucial to restrict one's remarks on the basis of firsthand information or an otherwise thorough understanding of the matter in discussion. A claim of ignorance in response to a given inquiry is far less damaging than open-ended speculation or a fabrication of events or data. Concurrently, any media misinforma- tion should be met with facts already on record, if possible. D.) When speaking before school or college groups or when teaching a class on the subject, care should be exercised to be objective and to refrain from personal veiwpoints regarding the nature, origin or purposes of the presumed intelligences unless one's bias is clearly stated. E.) Care should be taken to present government statements within the context of a document's overall scope and tenor as well as any known circumstances which prompted it. Further, the speaker should advise the audience that public officials' declarations may not be construed as current government policy. F.) If possible, as a courtesy the organization's leader for the state/province should be notified prior to a speaking appearance in that state/province. II. Dissemination of Case Information to the Public or Media A.) The identity of a witness to a UFO incident must remain anonymous unless permission has been obtained in writing from the witness on a signed report form or by separate means. B.) Incomplete or unsupported case findings should not be released to the media. If an incident is neither satisfactorily explained nor established as a credible UFO event, any comments to the media should underscore that the case report remains open. A case resolution should be communicated to the witness(es) before being publicized. In the event that a witness does not agree with the finding, the investigator should state that the explanation is not accepted by the witness. Failure to convince a witness of a plausible IFO finding, however, does not constitute a deterrant to releasing the conclusion. C.) Tabloid publications have damaged the integrity of UFO investigative organizations. UFO researchers should, not knowingly convey any information directly or indirectly to a tabloid news representative. Whenever the ultimate use of an interview is questionable or unknown, the investigator/researcher is expected to obtain written assurance, prior to offering any observations, of the specific publications to which the information may be conveyed. HI. Personal Gain from UFO Information A.) Lecture fees from educational, civic or other nonprofit organizations or institutions and remuneration from reputable publications are acceptable. B.) Remuneration from tabloid or other publications of questionable news/public affairs content is to be rejected. IV. Questions of Interpretation of Implementation of the Policies in Sections I-III Should be Directed to the PIPE Committee. A.) Failure to abide by these guidelines may result in one or both of the following: 1.) PIPE Committee recom- mendation to revoke the person's membership. 2.) For inaccurate published information, a PIPE Committee correction in the form of a letter to the editor. MUFON 103 Oldtowne Rd.

FORTY YEARS AGO--October 1947: A few months after Kenneth Arnold's sighting over the Cascade Mountain range, the UFOs returned for another tour of the area. Murray Schutz ;• was aboard an airliner somewhere over the Washington- Oregon area when the pilot suddenly spoke over the intercom: \"I'm sure all of you heard about the flying, disc things Kenneth Arnold reported,\" the pilot excitedly told his passengers. \"We seem to. have them out there again today (exact date unknown).\" Schutz glanced put the window and there -- in broad daylight - he saw six disc-shaped craft flying just above the mountain peaks. He and about 100 other passengers on the plane watched the discs for several minutes. * •*• * THIRTY-FIVE YEARS AGO- OctoBer 1952: \"At. 6:30 PM on the sixth, dozens of witnesses observed the flight of a luminous cigar-shaped craft along the western coastline of Algeria, North Africa. Four days later a large cigar-shaped craft, accompanied by a group of spining discs, were seen over Germany, Norway and Sweden. One published report carried eyewitness accounts from 30 Swedish cities; at least 7,000 people were said to have watched the mysterious formation. On the 14th, hundreds of Frenchmen at Lens and Oleron reported another cigar-shaped craft with a convoy of discs. Many of the observers were leading citizens, including several college professors at Oleron. Some witnesses in Oleron reported that one disc discharged hundreds of odd, fiberlike threads as it zig-zagged over the city. One man insisted he had been caught like a fly in a spider web, and several witnesses confirmed his claim. About 100 residents of Gaillac, France (Department, of Tarn) reported witnessing a UFO formation at about 4 PM on the 27th. There were 16 disc- shaped craft — with a slight hump on 18 top — which were revolving and giving off a bluish light at the sides. Witnesses also observed an elongated cylinder, a \"flying cigar,\" traveling in the disc formation. All of the discs were said to have discharged shining whitish particles, which looked like glass-wool and accumulated on tree branches and telegraph wires. Many persons said that they had been. able to , gather clusters of such particles, but'that they had quickly disintegrated, making it impossible to have them analyzed. The craft remained in the area for about 10 minutes and,,then continued on their way in a straight line. '* * *' THIRTY YEARS AGO-6ctober 1957: On the night of the 10th, Spanish naval officer Miguel Espanol and. a companion, traveling by truck to Ceres, Brazil, encountered a gigantic UFO. At first high in the sky, bathing the whole region in light, the craft descended and. stalled their, vehicle. They estimated it to be at least 500 feet wide and 130 feet high, and oval or disc- shaped, with a long \"aerial\" projecting from its dome and topped by a red light. The hovering craft switched off all it's dazzling lights, and the two men saw completely human-looking small beings, the size of children and clad in luminous suits, appear in an open hatch of the craft and gaze down at them for about three minutes. The gigantic craft then flew off, launching a small disc as it did so. On the following afternoon, two middle-aged . couples boating near Nawaca, Fiji Islands, observed a circular white object descending vertically from the sky to the surface of the ocean. When they got close to the craft, they found it hovering about 20 feet above the water. As the Fijians moved closer to the craft they saw what they took to be the figure of a man standing on the outside of the UFO. This figure shone a very bright light on the boat — a light so powerful that they were dazzled and felt weak. Then the figure disappeared and the craft went into, a high speed vertical climb and vanished in a few seconds. On the 21st, a UFO was observed over England at 9:18 PM by Flying Officer D.W/ Sweeney, who was piloting a Meteor jet fighter on a training exercise. The object was spotted over the, RAF station at Gaydon, Warwickshire, where atomic bomber crews trained in Valiant aircraft. The jet almost collided with the object which was moving slowly and showing six lights. The UFO was picked up by radar at RAF station, Langtpft. The Air Ministry classified the object as unknown. A multi-colored UFO, estimated to be 40-50 feet in diameter that maneuvered sharply near their aircraft at high speeds was reported by two commercial pilots near Pampa, Texas, about 8:15 PM, on the 23rd. Pilot Emerson E. Goff said he. was descending when both he and. his passenger, . Harold Briggs, saw \"an exceptionally bright star\" above and to the left. Moments later, the \"star\" appeared . to approach them at high speed, its apparent size increasing rapidly. \"At that point, I could make out a faintly solid elliptical shape with an apparent rounded upper portion,\" Goff stated. \"It was lit up so brilliantly...that it was really hard to descern just the exact shape it did have.\" Now ahead of Goff's plane, the UFO suddenly began a rapid vertical climb, quickly levelled off, and vanished into storm clouds. The sighting lasted six minutes. \"I must conclude that the object was of an unknown, airborne phenomenon,\" Goff said, \"...and apparently under some kind of remote or onboard intelligent control.\" * * * TWENTY FIVE YEARS AGO - October 1962: Great globs of white, sticky material fell from the sky at Salt Lake City, Utah on the 18th, and settled"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"in balls and sheets and threads over much of the Utah-Power & Light Co. Gadsby plant. Some pieces were 60 to 70 feet long and gave the appearance of a tattered parachute. But the substance was sticky and disintegrated into nothing when stretched far enough. Some 50 employees first saw the white material high in the sky about 2 PM. Pete Beloz, a transmission engineer, said, \"At first it looked like two or three parachutes coming down. Then as it came closer we saw it was big globs of this stuff. A lot of it got tangled up in transmission lines, but it didn't cause any trouble. It was all over the place. I've never seen anything like it before.\" The material came from the north and fell from the sky for 20 minutes, mostly in the area of the Gadsby plant. * * * TWENTY YEARS AGO - October 1967: At 10:30 PM on the first, Sr. Valeriano Ruiz, communications technician, spot ted a strange craft close to the ground near Barcelona, Spain. Near it were four people about 1.70 meters tall wearing dark uniforms and bright helmets. The craft seemed about 4.5 meters long, with half-a-dozen oval windows and a rectangular tower on top, rising about three meters above ground level. Two of the people climbed on the tower to use some mechanism. After about 30 minutes the craft rose silently and vertically to about 180 meters. A strong metallic noise was heard, and the craft was lost to sight in less than three seconds. On the evening of the llth, Nora Tibbs was driving on Highway Two near Aldersyde, Alberta, Canada, when her car lights went out, the radio stopped working, and the engine quit. \"I stepped on the gas to pull over to the curb but there was no power, no lights, no radio or nothing.\" Then a dark oval shape began to circle her car. \"It circled around the car four or five times and then went away.\" When the object disappeared the car's power returned. A Parshall, North Dakota, cafe waitress observed a glowing UFO while she was driving home from work about 3 AM on the 27th. She said a large, round, revolving object seemed to rise from the ground. \"My car began steering very hard,\" she explained, \"bumping and swaying around on the road like it had four flat tires.\" It passed over a warehouse to the north and at this point Lt. Glen Brunsell of the Parshall police department sighted the object. \"If was so bright,\" he reported, \"that at times it hurt my eyes to look directly at it.\" The object stopped and hovered near a missile base, then \"it suddenly shot straight up into the sky and was gone in about three seconds.\" A shearing contractor (name withheld) was driving alone toward Boyup Brook, Australia at 9:35 PM on the 30th, when his car \"suddenly stopped-engine stopped--headlights went out-and car became stationary without any sensation of braking or deceleration.\" He said he then noticed a \"tube of light\" about two feet in diameter descend close to his windshield. Looking up the tube, he observed a blue, pulsating,. football- shaped object approximately 30 feet in diameter. After five minutes the .object sped off, disappearing in a \"flash.\" When the object vanished the witness found the engine running, lights on, and his car again traveling at 60 to 65 MPH. He felt no sensation of acceleration. •*•*•*•• FIFTEEN YEARS AGO - October 1972: No significant reports on file for this period. • * * * TEN YEARS AGO - October 1977: During the first week of October, an 18- year-old girl witnessed a pair of bright \"headlights\" flashing from a disc- shaped object moving silently through the skies over Walcott, Iowa, where she worked as a security guard. Gliding toward her as she manned a watchtower at the town's French and Hecht plant, the disc obscured a flashing red beacon light on the grain elevator. Her radio and walkie-talkie stopped working, and cows and crickets in a nearby field stood silent. A television in a nearby farm house went blank and a light-sensitive mercury vapor lamp about 100 yards away went dark. Terrified, she stood frozen outside the guardhouse and watched. Then she went in search of other witnesses. When she returned, the object was gone. Greg Hughes, 15, of Fairview, Kentucky, saw a UFO about 5:15 AM on the 10th as he was driving the cows back to the barn for milking. \"I rode my horse into the woods and saw an orange object about eight to ten feet above the ground. It came toward me and got brighter and larger, and made noises like sirens wailing. It was shaped like a hotdog and about eight feet long. My horse nayed and the cows bawled. The cows were so spooked that they nearly beat the horse and me back to the barn. I saw something I never want to see again,\" Hughes said. UFO NEWSCLIPPING SERVICE The JFO NEWSCLIPPING SERVICE will keep you informed of all the latest United States and World-Wide UFO activity, as it happens! Our service was started in 1969, at which lime we contracted with a reputable international newspapenclipping bureau to obtain for us, those hard to find UFO reports (i.e., little known photographic cases, close encounter and landing reports, occupant cases) and all other UFO reports, many of which are carried only in small town or foreign newspapers. \"Our UFO Newsclipping Service issues are 20-page monthly reports, reproduced by photo-offset, containing the latest United States and Canadian UFO newsclippings, with our foreign section carrying the latest British, Australian, New Zealand'and other foreign press reports.

Of course, he is correct in a number of his observations. I would add one case that I have been involved in which . is perhaps the oddest I have come across. Briefly, on 4 August 1980, Mrs. E. Sage of Medway, Kent, was walking down an alley towards some shops. It was 4:50 p.m. Out of the corner of her eye she saw a ring of smoke and some sparks and then a craft materialised at .the place where these had been an instant before. The craft was a miniature helicopter, only four or five feet long, and lacking any rotor blades, doors, engines or windows. But it did have a large perspex bubble on the front, inside of which two men sat and it also had what appeared to be green and tan camouflage markings on the side. The two \"men\" inside were of normal height, wearing grey jumpsuits and seemed to be identical twins, with the exception that, one had long corn- coloured hair and the other dark. Both wore their hair to shoulder length and had olive complexions. OZ FACTOR The sighting preceded with many complicating factors of a close encounter. The effect I call the \"Oz Factor\" immediately took hold; with all sounds disappearing from around her (Mrs. Sage said it was \"as if I was hearing (the .object) from inside something\"), she also smelt a sweet odour and became faint - but saw the object float down near to her and a sort of \"telepathic\" conversation occur between the two occupants. They appeared to be arguing about her intrusion and this ended with the blond man saying, \"It's alright, she thinks we're army.\" There is more to the story (not least some bizarre effects at the site, 20 where Mrs. Sage claimed the alley changed its physical dimensions permanently afterwards!) - but most interesting is another connection with the ubiquitous CE 4 case. Mrs. Sage forgot the whole thing until : five, weeks later, on 8 September, when a neighbor chanced to mention a media story on UFOs and this catalysed a 'flash picture which over the next five or six weeks crystalised into full recollection of the events. How one rates a story like that I do not know. Mrs. Sage told it to me quite soon afterwards and I could not even see how it fitted the UFO field, until by remarkable coincidence I was looking through some old magazines and discovered from about a decade before a small item relating to another mini- helicopter sighting at another location in Kent very close by. There were differences, but this also included occupants and had enough similarities to suggest conections. The case was not published outside the tiny local group press in the UK and I think it highly improbable that Mrs; Sage saw it. FIELD CIRCLES I also wanted to comment on Dennis' remarks about the corn field circles in British fields. He is quite right in being sceptical of the UFO connection, which has been prompted in the US (eg., by some fairy tales in Weekly World News). However, sad as it is for me to say this since I was weaned on FS/?,, please do nof judge anything on what appears in there...on most subject, including the circles. I am afraid if you were to gauge reaction from almost everyone seriously involved in British ufology you will find one of few subjects they agree on is the mixture of amusement, bemusement and dismay that follows any glance at FS/?. From its once proud position it has fallen from grace and is not representative in most ways of what is going on...at least not in Britain. The \"rnystery\"' circles were first investigated by BUFORA in 1980 when they initially appeared., Excellent work with Tan Mrzyglod and Bristol University appeared in Probe Report in the next two years, totally demolishing the media hype of UFOs. Since that time Paul' :; Fuller, a geographer and statistician who is BUFORA's regional investigations coordinator for Hampshire arid Wiltshire (the counties where 99 per cent of these rings appear each summer) has worked closely with Dr. Terence Meaden, a professional meteorologist and head of the Tornado : and Storm Research organization and editor of the Journal of Meteorology. They have put months of hard graft into scientific appraisal of these rings (which change patterns from year to year but are clearly a terrain and weather related phenomenon). Although we long ago recognized that these .patterns are not caused by UFOs the National and local press in Britain have resurrected the idea that they do every, summer since 1983 and FS/?, laughing-as it does at anything other than some kind of supernatural explanation, has frankly played right into their hands. . It was for. this reason that BUFORA decided we had to devote precious time, and .resources to the matter. In the summer of 1986 we prepared a detailed 28-page .report, entitled Mystery of the. Circles. I .provided a historical review of the subject, Paul Fuller reported on the morphology of the rings and gave pros and cons for the various theories and then we summarised the highly technical work,that Dr. Meaden has published over several issues of the meteorological press. His view, that a novel type of fair-weather, short-lived stationary whirlwind is responsible for the patterns, has ample support and in the absence of any strong reason to believe otherwise has been accepted. Paul, myself and one or two others in the BUFORA investigation team had geared, up a campaign for the return of the circles which we knew would come in June or July 1986. The booklet was ready for immediate release, a London press conference/public meeting (continued next page)"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"IN OTHERS' WORDS By Lucius Parish The Summer issue of PHILIP MORRIS magazine has a five-page article on the renewed interest in UFOs, including comments on Hopkins' INTRUDERS, Strieber's COMMUNION, etc. Overall, a well- balanced article with a minimum of errors. The magazine is free and copies of this particular issue may be ordered from: 120 Park Avenue - N.Y., NY 10017. READER'S DIGEST also has an update on recent UFO books and events in their August issue, but there is little here that we have not already read elsewhere. The \"Anti-Matter/UFO Update\" column in the September issue of OMNI features the theory of Wesley Bateman concerning one of the TBM Avenger torpedo bombers which disappeared off the coast of Florida in 1945. Based on a photo of an anomalous object which was taken by the Apollo 11 astronauts, Bateman believes one of the planes is encased in ice and orbiting the Earth some 6,000 miles out. In a rebuttal, Philip Klass argues that there was no mystery at all about the fate of the planes in question and that Bateman's theory has no substance. Two more booklets .in Loren Gross' series are now available: UFOs: A HISTORY -1952: July 21st-July 31st - UFOs: A HISTORY -1952: August. As with all others in this series, these two latest additions are highly recommended. They are available at $6.00 each from the author: 690 Gable Drive - Fremont, CA 94538. If you have missed any of the previous booklets, ask Gross about their availability. One of the best of the \"ancient astronauts\" books, THE SIRIUS MYSTERY by Robert K.G. Temple, is now available in a quality softcover edition. Temple's primary focus is the mythology of the African Dogon tribe, which seems to incorporate some very \"unorthodox\" information concerning the Sirius star stystem and visitors from that system in ancient times. This edition of the book is priced at $12.95 and may be ordered from: Inner Traditions International Ltd. - One Park Street - Rochester, VT 05767. If you're like me and still haven't found time to read Whitely Strieber's COMMUNION, you might be interested in hearing actor Roddy McDowall read the book. A two- cassette set of tapes is available from Dove Books on Tape, Inc. - 12711 Ventura Blvd., Suite 250 - Studio City, CA 91604. The price is $14.95 and I'd suggest adding $1.50 or so for postage. These sets are 2 hours, 57 minutes in length and may be available at larger bookstores and audio centers. Timothy Good's book, ABOVE TOP SECRET, has been sold to William Morrow and should be published in a U.S. edition fairly soon, probably in the Spring of 1988. The book has made the best-seller lists in England and should be of much interest to American readers when it appears here. LETTERS, continued involving all the key participants was in embryo, ready for organization within a week of the first \"circle, sighting\", and Paul and I had much media work to set in motion. The result was a barrage of sensible publicity in the quality press and on TV and considerable success for BUFORA's booklet (which had to be quickly reprinted). The public generally were appreciative of efforts to find a workable solution. You may have noted that FSR failed to mention any of this and merely continued to dismiss natural explanations in such a contemptuous fashion that it grossly mislead its readers into thinking those who adhered to the \"wind\" as the cause were both mad and uninformed; although I would argue that it is eminently more sensible to work with professional scientists in the appropriate field and trust to their judgement than invent wild ideas that champion notions which you want to believe in. In the Winter of 1986-1987 Paul Fuller and Terence Meaden have continued their work. Indeed (we think for the first time) there has been a jointly funded research project between a UFO group (BUFORA) and a scientific research centre (The Storm and Tornado Organization). This conducted a major field study and survey of Hampshire cereal farms, revealing much useful data on the genesis of the rings. BUFORA is proud of all this work, which may not be directly relevant to UFOlogy but is surely what Ufology is all about. We do not feel that we need to apologize for attempting to understand these circles and spending considerable time and money working with scientists to do precisely that. FSR, on the other hand, may need to apologize to its many American readers for failing dismally to make any reference to this, because it did not support the utterly unsupportable contention that these rings have anything whatsoever to do with UFOs. Mystery of the Circles is available from BUFORA (16 South Way, Burgess Hill, England RH15 9ST) at £1.25 or US equivalent (plus extra for air mail postage; cheques to \"BUFORA Ltd\"). The progress report on the 1986- 1987 research is available as an update to the publication at £1, but is being summarised in the literature (I have a piece in OMNI and Paul Fuller and Dr. Meaden are producing articles for the meteorological press). BUFORA's twice-annual Journal of Transient Aerial Phenomena will also report. I am afraid Dennis Stillings helicopter theory is untenable as an explanation for the circles because of several features of their morphology... plus the fact that on a couple of occasions witnesses have been adjacent to the fields when a circle formed and would certainly have noticed a helicopter (or UFO for that matter!). 21"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"LETTERS, continued Dear Editor, Virgil Staffs comments in No. 232, August 1987 issue misses the whole point of my article re. Communion. I. suggest he re-read it. I know Strieber discusses various hypotheses for the origin of \"UFO entities,\" but nowhere in his book does he suggest that mental merging of humans with these \"entities\" might be to our detriment. I suggest ufologists and \"abductees\" seek out ways to avoid contacts with this unknown quality until we can figure out what it is and what it wants. When I suggested this at the newly-formed Los Angeles support group of abductees, the idea was received with gratitude by abductees who were present, and whose greatest fear seemed to be further, unwanted contact. I cannot believe that the human race is entirely at the mercy of the Phenomenon, whatever it is. Ann Druffel Pasadena, CA CANADIAN, continued 5.

YEARS • IS LONG • ENOUGH Fund j>r OFO) Raiarch THE NIGHT SKY By Walter N. Webb MUFON Astronomy Consultant NOVEMBER 1987 Bright Planets (Evening Sky): Venus, gleaming at magnitude -3.9, is still very low in the SW at dusk, setting little more than an hour after the Sun in mid-November and l'/ 2 hours after at month's end. The brilliant planet passes 2° south of Saturn on the 20th. Jupiter, still retrograding in Pisces, remains a dominant feature of the sky most of the night. The giant world is well up in the south during midevening. It shines at magnitude -2.8. Saturn, in Ophiuchus, is still visible into early November low in the SW at dusk, setting about 2 hours after sunset. The ringed planet enters the morning sky next month. Its magnitude is +0.5. See Venus. Bright Planets (Morning Sky):        ; Mars, in Virgo, rises in the east about 4 AM in midmonth (2'/ 2 hours before. sunrise). It glows faintly at magnitude +1.7. The crescent Moon lies near the red planet on November 19.           • Meteor Showers: Two meteor displays take place in November.The first one, theTaurids, peaks about the 3rd but unfortunately a bright gibbous Moon interferes most of the night. Lesser numbers of these reddish meteors radiate from Taurus the Bull from about October 20 to November 30. The situation is better for the swift Leonids, which climax before dawn on the 18th at 15 per hour. A crescent Moon rises about 4 AM. Every 33 years the Leonids put on a spectacular show when Earth intersects the center of this, meteor swarm. Next time is 1999. Moon Phases: Full moon-November 5 Last quarter-November 13 New Moon-November 21 First quarter-November 27 The Stars: O C At 9 PM in mid-November the Summer Triangle is poised above the western horizon; the Great Square of Pegasus and other autumn stars occupy center stage in the south; and glittering Orion, the winter sky symbol, has popped up in the east. The Big Dipper \"scrapes\" the northern horizon at the nadir of its circumpolar orbit this month. 22"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"Across the pole from the Big Dipper is the crooked \"M,\" Cassiopeia the Queen. Like the dipper, Cassiopeia never sets from northern latitudes. Six months hence the queen and the dipper will have changed places so that the former will then resemble a \"W.\" Between the \"M\" of Cassiopeia and the fishhook shape of Perseus the Champion to the east, look for twin spots of light embedded in the Milky Way-- the Double Cluster of Perseus. Like the Pleiades (also in view in the east), the two clusters of stars are even better displayed in binoculars or telescope. But the real jewel of the November sky lies almost directly overhead in (actually beyond) Andromeda the Princess, a V-shaped double row of stars stretching eastward from the upper left corner of the Great Square. The Great Spiral Galaxy stands out to the naked eye in a dark sky as an elongated hazy patch. So remote is this vast wheel of billions of stars that its feeble light requires two million years to reach us! MESSAGE, continued For each State Director to be effective, he/she must have competent and enthusiastic State Section Directors. The following new State Section Directors were appointed this month: Charles A. Huffer, M.S. for Washington, Benton, Carroll and Madison Counties in Arkansas; Mrs. Mildred Higgins is the Asst. State Director and Ed Mazur is State Director; Michael C. Luckman (Director for the New York Center for UFO Research) to State Section Director for the New Yrok City Burroughs of Manhattan, Queens, Bronx, Brooklyn and Staten Island; Michael D. Palmiter, a retired police officer, for Lawrence and Martin Counties in Indiana; Frank A. Mugnier, Jr. for Delaware and Chester Counties in Pennsylvania; Pat J. Marcattilio for Mercer County in New Jersey; Paul E. Burgeron for Cheshire County in New Hampshire; and Scott Wilkerson for Gibson County in Indiana. Richard T. Santee, Ph.D., living in San Francisco is a new Consultant in Psychology. Jeffrey M. Clark, M.S. of Alexandria, Va. volunteered to serve as a Research Specialist in Library Science. * * * For the past year the Public Information and Public Education Committee has struggled with the difficult task of writing a MUFON Media Policy Statement that could be used as a guideline for all members when dealing with the public and news media, when their statements could be interpreted as representing the official policy of the Mutual UFO Network. At the annual P.I.P.E. Committee meeting in Washington, D.C. on June 26, 1987, after considerable in-depth discussion, Dr. David M. Jacobs volunteered to modify the proposed Media Policy Statement to make it more compatible and realistic for members to abide by. The title was changed to \"Media Policy Guidelines\" and the overall goal was revised to read \"In order to strengthen the credibility of UFO-related pursuits, the following guidelines are strongly recommended for all members representing MUFON to the media.\" The modified policy was submitted to the MUFON Board of Directors annual meeting by Marge Christensen for approval on June 28, 1987 in Washington, D.C., where it was approved by a vote of the MUFON Board. A copy has been distributed to all State Directors, however it is imperative that all members know how to respond to the news media when they are called upon to do so. A copy of the new policy is published in the October 1987 issue of the MUFON UFO JOURNAL. Our gratitude is extended to Marge Christensen and her P.I.P.E. Committee for resolving this challenging and difficult problem. * * * Franklin A. Youri still has an abundant supply of MUFON lapel pins for $4.00, including postage and handling. You may order pins by writing to him at 1300 Sherwood Drive, Turlock, CA 95380 or MUFON in Seguin, Tex. where pins are also available. The MUFON 1987 International UFO Symposium Proceedings are available from MUFON for $15 plus $1.50 for postage and handling. It contains all of the papers delivered by the featured speakers that were received for publication by June 1,1987 when the proceedings went to press. Starting with the August 1987 issue of the MUFON UFO JOURNAL and continuing as long as good material is submitted for publication, the magazine will contain 24 pages instead of 20. The cover stock will be revised to use a high quality slick paper when our new computer/printer is producing address labels. Robert Bishop has been hired as a computer operator to perform the many applications planned for MUFON's new computer. The MUFON UFO JOURNAL is presently the only known monthly UFO organization magazine in the world. It will continue to be the leader if our members contribute articles concerning their investigations, research projects, and UFO related material for publication. SKYLOOK and the MUFON UFO JOURNAL have made great strides since the first issue was published in September 1967 by Norma Short. 23"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"DIRECTOR'S MESSAGE by Walt Andrus Thomas H. Nicholl has submitted his resignation as Deputy Director for Business Administration (Vice President), since he didn't feel that he was actively contributing as a member of the MUFON Executive Committee. He volunteered to serve as State Director for Kansas, replacing Stan Fouch, also of Leawood, Kansas, who submitted his resignation several months ago. Mr. Nicholl and Mr. Fouch hosted the successful MUFON 1973 UFO Symposium in Kansas City, Missouri. The resignation of Mr. Nicholl, as Deputy Director, has created a vacancy on the Executive Committee. Since one of the prime responsibilities of the Mutual UFO Network is the investigation of UFO sighting reports, greater emphasis and proportionate importance may now be applied through a reorganization within the Executive Committee. At the Annual MUFON Board of Directors meeting in Washington, D.C. on June 28, 1987, Dan Wright volunteered to fill the newly established position of Investigative Coordinator while retaining his position as Central Regional Director. The Executive Committee has elevated Dan Wright to Deputy Director for Investigations so as to strengthen one of our major objectives. As the world's largest UFO membership organization, it is imperative that the area of investigations should receive maximum attention. An election will be conducted to select a Central Regional Director during early 1988 from the members living in the Central States. Nominations are now being accepted for candidates to fill this vacancy and placed on the ballot. * * * It has been traditional to announce the host organization for the upcoming annual symposium at the Washington, D.C. 18th Annual MUFON UFO Symposium so as to provide maximum planning and preparation time. A Dan Wright proposal was made to Directors of the J. Allen Hynek Center for UFO Studies to host the 1988 event, however they regretfully declined due to a shortage of people to staff such a committee in the Chicago vicinity. We are elated to announce that the MUFON 1988 UFO Symposium will be held at the University of Nebraska in Lincoln on June 24,25 and 26,1988 and hosted by the Fortean Research Center or MUFON of Nebraska. Ray W. Bocche will be the host chairman and be assisted by Scott Colborn. Mr. Boeche is the State Director for Nebraska and Mr. Colborn is the Asst. State Director. Ray was instrumental in conducting the two UFO conferences sponsored by the University of Nebraska in 1982 and 1983, therefore he and his committee are eminently qualified to handle this responsibility. The tentative theme for the symposium is \"The Nature of the E.T. Phenomenon.\" The facilities of the University of Nebraska - Lincoln, Department of Conferences and Institutes, 205 Nebraska Center, have been contracted by .MUFON for the symposium. Room rates will be $35 for a single and $40 for a double in the hotel which includes a restaurant, auditorium, and adjacent meeting rooms within the same complex. It is comparable to the accomodations provided at Michigan State University in 1986 and far superior to the dormitory style rooms at The American University in Washington, D.C. Invitations to the featured speakers will be mailed in the near future by Walt Andrus so adequate preparation time for the published papers will be attained. Start planning your vacations now to come to the Cornhusker State Capital which is centrally located for North America. * * * The success of MUFON compared to other UFO organizations has been the \"grass roots\" structure of its leadership. The State Directors are directly responsible for the investigative teamwork, communication and cooperation among their members. It is a pleasure to announce the promotion of the following men to State Directors: Robert E. Engberg, a professional engineer and former State Director for Minnesota, is the new director for North Dakota; Myron W. Carlson, an aircraft accident investigator and State Section Director for Weld County has assumed the position of State Director for Colorado with Judy Brigham as Asst. State Director; and John O. Lear, airline Captain and former State Section Director for Clark County to State Director for Nevada. Both Mr. Carlson and Mr. Lear will appoint State Section Directors to fill the vacancies created by their promotions. Many of our members met John Lear in Washington, D.C. at the MUFON 1987 International UFO Symposium. (continued on page 23)"}]
