For the second year in a row, at- tendees at the annual MUFON Sym- posium suffered through a loss of air- conditioning. In this case, lightning struck near the Hyatt Regency O'Hare Hotel, site of the symposium, at 7 a.m. Sunday morning, knocking out lights, hot water, elevators in the hotel's four wings and central air-conditioning un- til approximately 3:30 p.m. that after- noon. A few armpits and brows were dampened, but apparently not too many spirits. In fact, the Symposium was a success on several levels, particularly in terms of attendance. Counting preregistration and walk-ups, some 700-800 people probably passed through the exhibition room and main auditorium over the three-day weekend. Along the way, there were a few im- promptu schedule changes. As the first scheduled speaker Saturday morning, I was supposed to give a brief history and overview of the crop circle phenomenon. Thanks to the presence of two unexpected visitors from England, photographer Busty Taylor and dowser Richard Andrews, both also intimately involved with the circles, it was decided that Michael Chorost and I would share my Saturday slot, turn- ing over Michael's Sunday morning hour to Taylor and Andrews for an up- date of current events in England. It was a good idea, but one that was thwarted by a lightning bolt. Crop Circles For my own part, I tried to briefly background the audience about the circles by showing slides primarily based on my visit last summer to the Wiltshire area, southwest of London, where most of the more spectacular for- mations traditionally appear. This is a rolling landscape already rife with mystery in the form of Stonehenge, Robert Gribble, right, receives a $500 check from Bruce Maccabee as outstand- ing ufologist of the year. Center, MUFON's international director, Walter Andrus. Avebury, Silbury Hill, Europe's largest man-made mound, and numerous other ancient and enigmatic structures. But I also wanted to emphasize the more \"mundane\" aspects of the phenomenon, if that were possible. For one thing, there is a tendency to think of all crop circles as huge spectacular formations of considerable geometrical complexity, so-called \"pictograms\" or \"agriglyphs\" like those usually pictured in aerial photographs. In reality, more than ninety percent of all crop circles are relatively small and simple affairs, many little more than a few meters in diameter. Secondly, there is the nature of the historical record. In the same way that the UFO phenomenon \"dates\" from Kenneth Arnold's 1947 sighting, crop circles may be said to date from the summer of 1980. The popular percep- tion is that the phenomenon has ex- panded almost exponentially ever since in terms of both numbers and complex- ity, and to a certain extent this is born out by the available evidence, fragmen- tary as it is. Just over 300 circles were recorded during the 1989 growing season, for example, while last summer saw over a thousand such formations, including staggering new developments in shapes, size and patterns. Part of this expansive explosion can no doubt be attributed to the vast in- crease in the number of investigators now in the field, but hardly all of it. Unfortunately, as with the UFO, we'll probably never know with certainty when the first circle \"fell.\" Scattered reports have subsequently surfaced back to WWII and earlier, and at least two historical incidents seemingly sim- ilar in nature have now been traced back to the 17th and 16th centuries. Early on, from 1980 forward, that is, crop circles were also intimately associated with the UFO phenomenon, primarily for their resemblence to so- called \"saucer-nests\" and similar physical traces. Their relationship is no longer quite so clear, although it is true MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 280 August 1991"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"that they continue to be treated in the same breath by the tabloid media as fly- ing saucers and little green men. Michael Chorost treats the issue of whether or not the more complex crop circle formations can be treated as a symbolic \"language\" or attempt at communication in his symposium paper, \"Theses For a Pre-Paradigm Science: Cereology.\" During his presentation, however, Chorost issued a call for the sharing and distribution of the increasing crop circle database, which, for the most part, remains in private hands. Without the available data, Chorost urged, cereologists can't even begin to make the basic determina- tions and predictions required by a fledgling science. To good effect, he cited the example of Tycho Brahe and Johannes Kepler. The former was the foremost observational astronomer of his day, but he believed that his im- mense database, which he kept from his student, Kepler, supported the Ptolemaic system. Only after his death was Kepler able to gain access to Brahe's detailed observations and demonstrate the obviousness of Coper- nicus' contention that it was the earth that revolved round the sun and not the other way around. \"What this teaches us,\" said Chorost, \"is that you can have the right data and the wrong conclu- sion.\" The 12th Planet The second originally scheduled speaker was Zechariah Sitchin, the author of The 12th Planet and a subse- quent series of books that outline in detail the most ambitious \"ancient astronaut\" theory yet, backed in large part, Sitchin claims, by the Bible itself. Born in Russia and raised in Palestine, Sitchin early on studied the Bible in its original Hebrew. It was a dispute over the meaning of the word Nefilim that set young Sitchin on his lifelong study. The Nefilim are first mentioned in the sixth chapter of Genesis, the account of the great deluge. His teacher inter- preted the word to mean \"giants,\" whereas the original phrase actually means \"those who came or fell down to earth.\" c R O P C I R C L E S C O N F E R E N C E MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 280 August 1991"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"M I C H A E L C H O R O S T Sitchin soon learned that legends of physically present \"gods\" who had come from the heavens were hardly confined to the Bible. The pagan Greeks held much the same view, as did the even more ancient Egyptians. Moreover, the Egyptians claimed that their gods, who cohabited with Earth women, had come from a land known as Ur-Ta, or Ur, the capital of Mesopotamia, or today's Iraq. Some of the world's oldest cities are found in the fertile regions of desert watered by the Tigris and Euphrates rivers, including Nineveh and Babylon. But it was the even older Sumerian civilization, according to Sitchin, that held the key to the identity of the Nefilim and the secret of our own existence. Not the least of these mysteries is the sudden rise out of nowhere of the Sumerians themselves. \"We tend to think of human progress,\" Sitchin said, \"as a process of gradual evolution. The fact that puzzles all scholars is that in Shumer, or Sumer, a high civilization blossomed out suddenly and unex- pectedly. Without a precedent, there sprung up a civilization that had great cities, high-rise temples, palaces, courts of justice, commerce, shipping, irriga- tion, metallurgy, mathematics and medicine; whose people included kings and priests, judges and doctors, dancers and musicians. And above all: a writ- ten language, scribes, schools, a literature, epic tales and poems. Every aspect of a high civilization that we can think of had its 'first,' its beginning, in Sumer.\" As importantly, if not more so from Sitchin's point of view, the Sumerians had a history, a history that all they knew they learned from the Anunnaki, literally \"those who from Heaven to Earth came.\" In other words, the Anun- naki were the Nefilim; and according to Sumerian \"myth\" they had arrived here some 450,000 years ago from the solar system's twelfth planet, Niburu, which orbits the sun in a vast ellipse, approaching perihelion every 3600 years. (The sun and moon were also regarded as \"planets\" by the Sumerians.) MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 280 August 1991"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"A ccording to Sitchin, the first Anunnaki came in search of gold, not for jewelry, but in the form of gold dust to be scattered above the atmosphere of Nibiru to serve as a shield against an impending ecological disaster. But the small number of workers soon revolted. The solution, dreamed up by their chief scientist, was to create a race or breed of drone workers, which the Anunnaki genetical- ly engineered from a local lifeform, one of the higher primates. Theoretically, this took place some 300,000 years ago. Events proceeded more or less accor- ding to plan until approximately 13,000 years ago, the time of the Deluge. \"Man, at first a primitive worker and then a sexual plaything, was now need- ed as a partner to survive on a devastated Earth. And so, each time Nibiru neared Earth, every 3600 years, mankind was given another dose of ad- vance, of knowledge, of civilization.\" The landing base of the Anunnaki, ac- cording to Sitchin, still exists as the great platform of giant cut stone that constitutes Baalbek. Sitchin argues that the interaction between the Anunnaki / Nefilim and humankind continues to- day and may be reflected by events in the Persian Gulf. There is some evidence, he says, that a base was established on Mars and that the UFO humanoids reported today may be lit- tle more than robots created by the Anunnaki, whose planet of origin is now on a return approach. \"Until we know more,\" Sitchin con- cluded, \"one thing seems clear. To understand the present, we must understand the past; and by understand- ing the past, we might find clues to the future.\" The idea of ancient astronauts hav- ing seeded our civilization is, admitted- ly, a seductive one. Unfortunately, it has its uncomfortable aspects, as well. For one thing, how come no clearly extra- terrestrial objects of a metallic and manufactured nature have ever been found by archeologists? And if the Anunnaki truly possessed an advanc- ed technology capable of space travel between planets, however near or dis- tant, why build launch pads out of sim- ple stone or erect giant landing beacons English visitors Richard Andrews, center, and Busty Taylor, right, demonstrate dowsing during the power blackout. (Egypt's pyramids) out of the same material? There is a purely philosophical ob- jection that surfaces, too. If the Anun- naki are used to explain the abrupt \"evolution\" of humankind, then what accounts for the existence of the original Anunnaki? Did they evolve gradually over millions of years on their own native planet, or were the Nefilim themselves the genetically engineered product of another race of technologically superior invaders? And if so, what planet did they come from? Unlikely Hybrids Some of these issues were raised by Michael Swords, a professor of natural science at Western Michigan Univer- sity, MUFON consultant, and the editor of the Journal of UFO Studies, publish- ed by the Center for UFO Studies. In a far-ranging presentation that demonstrated just how scintillating or- thodox science can be when applied to \"unorthodox\" ufology. Swords simultaneously addressed the issues of biological life on this planet, the ex- traterrestrial hypothesis, and the plausability of genetic engineering and alien/human interaction in general. In essence, said Swords, the like- lihood that extraterrestrial visitors will closely resemble humans in size, shape and overall appearance is considerable, while the possibility that they will be able to actively interbreed with ter- restrials is almost negligible, as is the consideration that we ourselves are the product of a previous alien intervention. At first this sounds like a case of a skeptical scientist wanting to have his cake and eat it, too; in the end, however, Swords proves to be a very persuasive chef. For any form of in- telligent being to arise, he argues, cer- tain local conditions must first be met or supplied. These include, foremost, a solid planetary body of limited size circling a specific type of sun within a comfortable distance range referred to as the \"Continually Habitable Zone.\" Too close to the primary source of solar energy and any life-support atmosphere boils away; too distant, and it freezes instead. Actually, this is a highly simplified summary of Swords' speech, the point being that the conglomeration of con- ditions that led to life on the planet Earth, while highly specific, are pro- bably generic enough so as to be prevalent throughout our local galaxy MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 280 August 1991"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"Arch-skeptic Philip Klass entertains the faithful. and the universe as a whole. In other words, there are a lot of similar situa- tions out there thought to be conducive to life; at the same time, there are cer- tain underlying principles of evolution which dictate that any said life will closely resemble our own in rough physical terms. Who or whatever ET is, he, she or it isn't likely to have, say, five limbs and three eyes or two heads. So close encounter eyewitnesses who report humanoid creatures shouldn't be discounted out of hand. By the same token, says Swords, the likelihood of genetic interaction be- tween two distantly removed species, in terms of both space and time, is so remotely negligible as to approach nil. Despite the fact that ET will most likely resemble the human form in gross outline, we are apt to be two genetically distinct and forever separated species due to the sequential stacking of our in- dividual gene packets. Those arguing that humankind is the product of past genetic \"tinkering,\" then, must need ex- plain why we are so closely tied to all previously evolved life on this particular planet, a span of seeming genetic con- tinuity that encompasses at least some three billion years, and perhaps closer to four. Whatever our intervening aliens are up to, suggests Swords, a simple extrac- tion or exchange of specific genes or chromosomes seems highly unlikely and unworkable. ET would be as well off starting from scratch, and that assumes they would have sophisticated genetic engineering techniques to begin with. Still, what about all the stories from people who claim to have been examin- ed and seemingly had genetic material extracted? Swords suggested several ways in which the classical scenario might be approached, including the no- tion that it might be artifically induc- ed or staged for the \"benefit\" of the ab- ductee as a means of masking other ulterior intentions. Mute Evidence While they don't make the headlines they used to, animal mutilations con- tinue at their own pace, as we were graphically assured by both Linda Moulton Howe and John Altshuler, M.D., who next shared the speakers' podium. Howe, an award-winning TV documentary producer and the author of An Alien Harvest, brought the au- dience up to speed with a series of slides and video clips, some taken as recently as January and February of this year, of various mutilated animals, now including deer, dogs and rabbits. The title of her talk was \"Further Evidence Linking Animal Mutilations and Human Abductions to Alien Life Forms.\" That evidence, once a trickle, is now a small stream, said Howe, and in- cludes eyewitness accounts from both abductees and non-abductees. Types of alien life forms reported in close association with mutilated animals in- clude a large lizard-like creature, small white beings and a so-called \"praying mantis.\" Dr. Altshuler, a Denver hematolo- gist, or blood and tissue specialist, has been involved with mutilation research since the case of \"Snippy\" the horse in September of 1967, and has per- formed several pathological exam- inations of mutilated deer, rabbit and cattle carcasses. \"The animals exa- mined,\" said Dr. Altshuler, \"have died in an unexpected fashion. That is to say, the common mode of exodus of animals must be eliminated. These include predation, cult sacrifices and acciden- tal death.\" When examined under a microscope, the areas of incised tissue from a mutilated animal are identical to those found in high-heat cautery surgery per- formed on humans, typically on the order of several hundred degrees cen- tigrade. \"It is difficult to avoid the in- escapable conclusion that the changes in animal tissues in these unexplained deaths had dissection with an instru- ment causing high heat. By what in- strumentation and means this is ac- complished remains a mystery,\" Dr. Altshuler said. \"But the fact that these animals are found in remote areas, away from human or animal tracks, off roads and away from highways, found within hours of being seen alive at a time of unusual observed aerial phenomena all suggest that extraterrestrial factors must be considered as a plausible explana- tion of the ever increasing numbers of unexplained animal mutilations.\" U.F.O.

Master of ceremonies Forest Crawford filled in in his stead; hopefully his own presenta- tion will be published in a future issue of the Journal. Professor Petit's own paper, \"Has Science Something To Do With UFOs?\" can be found in the Sym- posium Proceedings. For ordering details, see the Director's Message in this issue. At 301 pages, it is the largest Proceedings yet published. Abductions Saturday evening's program consisted of speeches by John Carpenter (ab- ductions), Stanton Friedman (crash retrievals) and Colin Andrews (crop circles). Andrews did not have time to prepare a printed paper, but his catalog of crop circle patterns can be found as an appendix to Michael Chorost's published paper in the Proceedings. Carpenter, a clinical hypnotist, ad- vised that one way of learning what the abduction experience is, or may be, is first to find out what it isn't. He examined several mundane mental disorders that might conceivably ac- count for the abduction experience, including schizophrenia, hysteria, paranoia, sociopathic personality and dissociative states. Each category could be rejected, for one or more reasons, for its failure to adequately address the known parameters of the phenomenon. Carpenter also considered such issues as post-traumatic stress, simple confabulation, folklore and fantasy, media influence, outright hoaxes, and the likelihood that such experiences could be the byproduct of hypnosis itself. If any or all of the above can- didates were likely culprits, Carpenter argued, we should expect to see the rich imagery and individualized imagination for which we humans are justifiably famous; instead, we get a stream of similar events and experiences that are almost boring in their rigidity and sameness. Other factors argue for the physical validity of abductions as well, including physical evidence (scars, etc.), the credibility of individual witnesses, and a surprising amount of correlations among the many different accounts now emerging into public review. \"Present- ly,\" said Carpenter, \"these include the comparison of written symbols, ob- served insignias, anatomical descrip- tions, physical movement, gesturings, touching, procedures, equipment, at- titude, behavoir, communications, war- nings, gifts, sharing of items, medical exams, emotional tests, holographic figures and scenes, human reactions, craft interiors and even the content of telepathic messages received after and between abduction encounters. \"There are also correlations among details that never seem to surface despite their commonality in our daily human lives. For example, most peo- ple might assume or imagine that any good physical exam would include a thorough study of a human's heart and lungs. Yet those elements have never surfaced in any of my cases or in the cases of other researchers with whom I have conferred. \"Much in the way that incest and child abuse remained hidden and disbelieved for years,\" Carpenter con- cluded, \"the disruption of human lives by an extraterrestrial presence is slow- ly revealing itself. It is a silent epidemic that is pleading for understanding and begging for acceptance.\" MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 280 August 1991"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"Crashed Saucers Stanton Friedman reminded us in his inimitable way that interest in the ac- counts of a crashed saucer(s) in New Mexico in the summer of 1947 is again heating up. By year's end, three new books will have appeared about the so- called Roswell Incident. Friedman's Chicago speech detailed recent developments, including his involve- ment with an \"Unsolved Mysteries\" segment on same, which led to the discovery of at least one newly alleged witness, Gerald Anderson. The latter, not quite six years old at the time, claims to have been at the original crash site of a flying saucer, and to have seen several small alien beings, at least one of whom was still alive. From what I can determine thus far of the varied ac- counts, this would mean that two UFOs crashed a couple of days and more than 100 miles apart. Thanks to financial support from the Fund for UFO Research and Arizona businessman Robert Bigelow, Friedman and colleagues have been able to inter- view at least two other recently iden- tified participants, including a Roswell mortician. Other interesting leads are in the process of being pursued. It will take some stamina to sort out the com- peting allegations and confusion over the Roswell Incident, not to mention its connection to the alleged MJ-12 presidential briefing paper. Among the other complications, as Friedman himself so succinctly puts it: \"We are racing the undertaker.\" Corn Circles Few phenomena in recent memory have so captured the public fancy as England's so-called corn, or crop circles. While similar circles apparently appear worldwide, including in this country, Britain's are by far the most spectacular and complex to date. Those who went to Chicago were treated to Colin Andrews' intriguing presentation Saturday night. An electrical engineer by trade, Andrews is co-author with Pat Delgado of Circular Evidence and Crop Circles: The Latest Evidence. Together they operate CPR, Circles Phenome- Gene M. Phillips non Research, one of the major data- gathering organizations presently in the field. And both, it must be said, reject the meteorological hypothesis of crop cir- cle formation first proposed by Dr. Terence Meaden, an Oxford-trained at- mospheric physicist. Meaden believes the circles are formed by a previously unrecognized type of whirlwind which he refers to as a plasma-vortex, elec- trically charged and rapidly rotating on a stationary vertical axis. Andrews argues that weather-related correlations don't stand up to scrutiny, and that some sort of \"non-human in- telligence\" is almost certainly involved. The geometrical patterns themselves are too precise and the formations too specifically sited to be the product of mere random forces. Many of the for- mations appear aligned with ancient monuments like Stonehenge, while a few even look as if they had been laid down with an eye to surrounding col- ors. Moreover, some formations have even been revisited, days or weeks later, with new fluorishes added. Whatever is responsible, Andrews added, \"it is of the utmost importance.\" Sunday Blues Sunday morning began with the aforementioned bolt out of the blue that knocked out power to the main auditorium, not to be restored until late that afternoon. The symposium and MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 280 August 1991"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"I those present, however, managed to carry on, often in an impromptu man- ner. Richard Andrews, for example, entertained a crowd in the hotel park- ing lot with a spontaneous demonstra- tion of his dowsing abilities. Some of the speakers were rescheduled for Sun- day evening and were able to deliver their presentations after all. Those who had to leave early or were no longer present for whatever reasons, will find the printed papers in the Symposium Proceedings, except for the crop circles update provided by Andrews and Tay- lor. What follows here is but a brief summary of Sunday's events. Government Connections Scott Jones, a former aide to Senator Claiborne Pell of Rhode Island and the president of the Human Potential Foun- dation, discussed some of his recent adventures in attempting to initiate an international sharing of UFO data. These included recent trips to both China and the Soviet Union in which metal specimens anecdotally associated with UFOs were retrieved for analysis and exchange between cooperating par- ties. With his own longtime involvement in governmental affairs, Jones was also able to offer insight into how various world governments treat UFO issues. Abduction Accounts Longtime abduction researcher David Jacobs, a professor of history at Temple University, asked what can we believe about abduction accounts? \"One of the great problems with abduction research is the difficulty of separating out confabulation, imagination, dream material and other false memories from the 'real' account. This problem is evi- dent in the great variety of abduction accounts that have been published over the years, including tales of seven-foot- tail aliens, benevolent beings here to help humanity, Phoenixes rising from the ashes, religious visions, and so forth. Most of these accounts were col- lected by researchers unaware of the full complexity of memory recovery.\" Jacobs concentrated particularly on the kind of confabulation that can oc- cur when an abductee is under hypnosis and may be prone to unconsciously in- vented memories. While other situations apply, Jacobs limited his remarks to three areas: description of aliens, re- counted conversations with aliens, and the interpretation of alien motives. Sort- ing out the signal from the noise in these matters may be especially tricky, and is further complicated by the observation that the abductors may place images directly in the abductee's mind. These subjects and more will be discussed in greater detail in Jacobs' latest book, Secret Life: the Structure and Meaning of UFO Abductions, forthcoming from Simon and Schuster early next year. Ancient Astronauts Gene M. Phillips, the president of the Ancient Astronaut Society, delivered a far-ranging presentation based on per- sonal slides taken at many of the most famous (and remote) sites of our ancient civilizations. His contribution to the published Proceedings consist of two ar- ticles which previously appeared in the Society's newsletter, Ancient Skies. The first of these treats the magnificent lines and layout of the Nazca Plains in Peru, while the second examines the huge stone walls of the same country, par- ticulary the fortress at Sacsayhuaman. GB w/o Ed By far the lengthiest individual paper in the Proceedings this year belongs to Dr. Bruce Maccabee and is titled \"Gulf Breeze Without Ed,\" Ed of course be- ing Ed Walters. The point of Mac- cabee's presentation must be obvious: to show that a UFO flap was in progress over Gulf Breeze, Florida, and may still be so, regardless of the multiple sightings and photographs made famous by Ed and Frances Walters. \"Since November 1987,\" said Maccabee, \"there have been more than 260 reports of UFO sightings in the Gulf Breeze area involving perhaps three times as many witnesses.\" Numerous still and video pictures have been taken of UFOs in the im- mediate vicinity, a few apparently of the \"Ed\" UFO, many more of mys- terious red balls of light, and most from near one end of the bridge that connects Pensacola to Gulf Breeze. Maccabee's published Symposium paper not only includes a complete listing of sightings up until April of 1991, but also contains many drawings and photographs made by witnesses other than Ed and Frances Walters. Skeptics and debunkers can discount the testimony of the Walters' if they want to, Maccabee concluded, but somehow they're going to have to account for the hundreds of other peo- ple involved as well. Such were the highlights of this year's annual summer Symposium. We meet next year in Albuquerque. My advice is to book early and bring along shorts and a T-shirt or two ... just in case!

The first of these is \"Annals of Government (The Truman Years — Part II)\" by Clark Clifford with Richard Holbrooke, an excerpt from Clifford's autobiog- raphy which appeared in the April 1, 1991 issue of The New Yorker. Clifford's long distinguished star has been tarnished of late by revelations of his (unwitting) involvement in the worldwide collapse of the $20 billion Bank of Credit & Commerce Interna- tional, which we need not go into detail about here. What concerns ufology is Clifford's comments about an old col- league of his, the late James Forrestal, former Secretary of the Navy under the Truman administration, and of course an alleged member of the controversial MJ-12, the supersecret high-level agen- cy supposedly charged with investi- gating recovered crashed UFOs and corpses. Clifford himself is something of a shadow figure in his own right, typical- ly referred to in the press as \"a Washington power broker,\" another way of saying that he tended to avoid the public spotlight. He served briefly as Lyndon Johnson's Secretary of Defense during the latter's bitter, embattled reign of the Viet Nam war. Before that he was what might be referred to as a \"presidential counsel,\" advising Democratic presidents from Truman through Kennedy Read the book or the three-part New Yorker series for further details. Again, what concerns us here is Clifford's revelations of the mindset of Forrestal during the latter's fall from grace, mental breakdown and eventual suicide, a tragic scenario that has assumed all sorts of ominous baggage in the wake of allegations surrounding MJ-12. Aside from Donald H. Menzel, the late Harvard astronomer and ardent UFO debunker and author, Forrestal remains the most enigmatic of all MJ-12 \"members,\" the assumption all too easi- ly being that he \"knew too much\" about the flying saucer mystery, and either leapt or was pushed to his death as a consequence. \"In more than 45 years in Washington,\" Clifford writes, \"I know of no more dramatic metamor- phosis than the one James Forrestal underwent in 1948.\" To this day, many of the documents detailing Forrestal's death remain sealed. To fully appreciate Clifford's com- mentary, we need to establish the con- text. Despite the combined Allied defeat of the Axis powers during WWII, President Truman was dissatisfied with the way in which the American war effort had been con- ducted. According to Truman, accor- ding to Clifford, we had been \"damn lucky\" to win. Truman expressed the feeling that \"if the Army and the Navy had fought our enemies as hard as they fought each other the war would have ended much sooner.\" The infighting assumed even odder proportions with the cessation of hostilities. Apart from the Army and Navy, the Marines and Air Force were now lobbying for independent status. While this was largely a domestic af- fair, it came at the same time that drastic international changes and realliances were afoot, primarily at the perceived threat of a Soviet-dominated Europe, which were soon to result in NATO and the Marshall Plan. In December of 1945, Truman sent down to Congress what Clifford refers to as \"the most radical reorganization of our armed forces in the nation's history,\" a plan drafted by Secretary of War Robert Patterson to combine \"the War and Navy Departments into one single Department of National Defense.\" The proposal would establish a central depu- ty of defense in charge of coordinated secretaries for our land, sea and air forces.

Both Clifford and Truman were in fevor of reintegrating the Marine Corps back into the Navy at war's end, which proved impossible. \"They have a pro- paganda machine that is almost equal to Stalin's,\" Truman lamented. A ccording to Clifford, Forrestal viewed the proposition to com- bine the various armed forces under a single chief of staff as an Ar- my plot engineered by General Dwight D. Eisenhower. Forrestal vehemently characterized it as \"completely un- workable.\" To a certain extent Clifford could sympathize; still, Forrestal seemed almost paranoidly opposed to the proposition. \"Even though he and I were friends,\" Clifford writes, \"I felt I never understood him.\" By 1946, though, it was clear that the Navy was the primary focus of Forrestal's trou- bled psyche. \"His personal life was unhappy,\" Clifford observes. \"His wife, Josephine, a beautiful, difficult and troubled woman, was drinking heavily.\" Moreover, \"Forrestal had left the Catholic Church, and was deeply guilt- ridden.\" He possessed great energy, Clifford admits, \"but limited vision.\" Forrestal feared that \"the creation of a separate Air Force would make the Navy the odd man out in interservice fights, overwhelmed by the combina- tion of the Air Force and the Army.\" Remember, this was some 45 years ago. However enlightened we may be about family and job stress now, most individuals at the time were absolute- ly ignorant of, and downright barbaric towards, incipient mental illness, and Clifford admits as much. In a diluted form, the National Security Act of 1947 took effect. In what Clifford calls \"a brilliant tactical decision, and one that had a profound effect on the future of the Pentagon,\" Truman named James Forrestal — the individual who had opposed the office most vociferously — the first Secretary of Defense. He was so sworn in on September 17, 1947, barely ten weeks after a UFO (or possibly two) alleged- ly crashed to Earth in the New Mexico desert not far from Roswell Army Air According to Clifford, Forrestal viewed the proposition to com- bine the various armed forces under a single chief of staff as an Army plot engineered by General Dwight D. Eisenhower. Force Base. Forrestal, who worked so diligently to kill or castrate the position which he now occupied, soon found himself con- strained by a lack of staff and official power. By October of 1948, according to Clifford, he had admitted defeat and actually urged upon Truman the forma- tion of the National Security Council. Of course Forrestal wanted the new presidental advisory council to be com- posed of military officials with its head- quarters centered in the Pentagon, op- tions successfully opposed by both Truman and Clifford, essentially resulting in the civilian NSC we know today. ForrestaFs conciliatory mood at the time, Clifford says, \"struck me as a strange combination of suppressed emotion, courage and a sense of defeat.\" P ersonal pressures, exacerbated by his wife's drinking, continued to mount. Perceived as a tool of Wall Street, partly for his opposition to Israeli independence, Forrestal was the brunt of several journalistic slights slung by noted columnists Drew Pear- son and Walter Winchell. Work became his sanctuary, to the point of exhaus- tion. Even so, Forrestal was often unable to sleep and took to calling friends in the middle of the night. Clif- ford says that he listened carefully, \"but with increasing puzzlement. Like most people in the nineteen-forties, my understanding of emotional disorders was quite limited, and I had no idea how serious an illness depression can be.\" Clifford recalls that on one occasion, during a 1948 cabinet meeting, he was sitting directly behind Forrestal when he noticed that \"he had scratched a raw spot on the top of his head with his fingernails. As the meeting progressed, he continued to scratch until it was the size of a half-dollar. I watched in silent horror as the blood slowly oozed from this spot.\" Sometime in 1949, Forrestal called Stuart Symington, who had been Assis- tant Secretary of War for Air and Clif- ford's closest other colleague in the capitol, and said he needed a lawyer because he wanted to change his will right away. Symington put Forrestal in touch with Paul Porter, a prominent Washington attorney, who called Sym- ington back a few days later and said \"This man is crazy. He is raving. He doesn't know what he wants.\" In March of 1949, following Tru- man's unexpected victory over Dewey, the President finally asked Forrestal to resign. On the day he left office, Clif- ford writes, Truman awarded him the Distinguished Service Medal. \"Unable to respond to the President's generous words of praise, Forrestal was led, speechless, from the room. It was sud- denly clear to everyone that something was very wrong.\" Forrestal was flown to Hobe Sound, a Florida resort, to recuperate, but ac- cording to Clifford, \"demons were in- side him, and rest could not quiet them.\" A former Under-Secretary of State, Robert Lovett, met Forrestal at the airport with a planned itinerary of golf, swimming and general relaxation. Forrestal quickly pulled Lovett aside and whispered that the Russians and Zionists were after him, and that the FBI was watching him. Shown his room in Lovett's house, Forrestal first searched the closets and under the bed for hidden microphones. Dr. William Menninger, the famous psychiatrist, was flown down to ex- amine Forrestal. When it became ap- parent that the latter could no longer function on his own, he was returned to Washington. In what Clifford calls \"a tragic error of judgment,\" the Navy vetoed suggestions that Forrestal be in- stalled in the Menninger or another private clinic, and insisted that he be confined to Bethesda Naval Hospital for fear that \"he might blurt out national- security secrets to the wrong people.\" MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 280 August 1991"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"/ watched in silent horror as blood slowly oozed from this spot. Mrs. Fbrrestal assented, and once there, her husband \"was assigned to the V.I.P. suite of rooms, on the sixteenth floor.\" A month later, Forrestal seemed to be recovering; at least friends were told he appeared more relaxed. Then in the dark of the night of May 22, 1949, he leapt through an unguarded hospital window to his death, leaving behind a hand-written note quoting the following lines from Sophocles, which address the suicide of an equally demented Ajax: ... Bet- ter to die, and sleep / The never wak- ing sleep, than linger on /And dare to live, when the soul's life is gone. Clifford's memoirs make for fascinating reading about a fascinating period. The restructuring of govern- ment in the wake of WWII and in the face of the ensuing Cold War was dramatic. \"In little more than three years,\" Clifford notes, \"President Truman established the Department of Defense, the Central Intelligence Agen- cy, the National Security Council, the position of chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and the first foreign-aid agen- cies. It was as if the nation had sudden- ly made the transition from horse- drawn carriages to the era of the automobile.\" Or flying saucer. UFO Abductions I was surprised to find a serious treat- ment of UFO abduction accounts in the current (August) newsstand issue of The Atlantic. The article, which runs from page 82 to 92, is \"The UFO Ex- perience,\" by James S. Gordon, a pro- fessor in the department of psychiatry at the Georgetown University School of Medicine in Washington, D.C. Gordon is also the director of the Center for Mind-Body Studies and the author of The Golden Guru: The Strange Journey of Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh (1987). Four nice color illustrations by Robert Goldstrom, including one of the now almost de riguer crop circles, accom- pany the text. After admitting that \"UFOs were once the news I avoided when I flipped through the supermarket tabloids,\" Gordon explains his reasons for writing the article. \"Three medical colleagues made me realize that there were aspects of the UFO phenomenon in which I should take a professional interest.\" First, a fellow psychiatrist told Gordon about one of her patients, \"a high- functioning woman professional,\" who suffered a series of anxiety attacks after having seen the alien face on the cover of Whitley Strieber's Communion. Secondly, \"a radiation oncologist who was a senior consultant to the French government's National Space Center described several people he had examined who had seemingly suffered the effects of radiation, including burns, after having witnessed 'craft that fly at incredibly high speeds.' \" Thirdly, \"a high-ranking European public-health official explained ... that she herself had been abducted. These physicians appeared perfectly normal, and all of them were convinced of the reality of a phenomenon that I regarded as evidence of psychopathology.\" S uitably intrigued, our author sets off for the Rocky Mountain Con- ference on UFO Investigation, now in its eleventh year, sponsored by Leo Sprinkle, professor emeritus of psychology at the University of Wyom- ing, Laramie. By now, this reader, at least, anticipates another article in a string of silly-season treatment of the UFO abduction experience. Surprising- ly, Gordon writes about events, in- cluding the UFO subject as a whole and the individuals he encounters in Laramie, in a fairly sympathetic and straightforward fashion, slightly be- mused that everyone involved doesn't have horns growing out of their heads or cars that sport bumper-stickers pro- claiming \"I Took a Ride Aboard a Fly- ing Saucer!\" If anything, Gordon is too much the reporter and too little the analyst. Just as I was settled in, expecting some sort of psychological insight based, perhaps, on the author's own clinical experience, the article ended. I had the dangling feeling that I had read the first part of a two-part article, or maybe an excerpt from a forthcoming book. Still, it's in- teresting to see a national publication with the stature of The Atlantic tackl- ing a tricky subject without resort to ridicule or outright dismissal. This could bode well for future serious treat- ment by other national magazines. All in all, a most odd and unexpected development. Crop Circles Finally, from the national newspaper of record, The New York (\"All the news that's fit to print\") Times, comes a cover photo and lengthy inside article, with two additional photos and map, about England's ongoing crop circles. The ar- ticle, \"Did Aliens or Pranksters Make the Corn Circles?\" by William E. Schmidt, appeared in the Saturday, July 27 issue. Unfortunately, the Times treat- ment is still that of sophomoric sensa- tionalism, although certainly written with somewhat more elan than we would expect from, say, the National Enquirer or Weekly World News. I dashed off a Letter to the Editor in response, but much doubt it will see the light of day. Rather than focusing on the very real scientific issues involved, our intrepid investigator chooses instead to make light of the circles and those looking in- to them. Farmers and landowners in the county of Wiltshire, where many of the circles fall, are generally described as entrepreneurs out to make a Pound. American visitors are dismissed as \"flying saucer enthusiasts.\" An editorial insert suggests that the 10 or so circles which appeared in northern Germany were the work of four local law students. \"We only wanted to show that what the English can do we can do here,\" one of the students was reported as saying. A team of visiting Japanese scientists from Waseda University, Tokyo, is reported as being in the field, but none is mentioned or quoted by name. Similarly, Dr. G. Terence Meaden is Continued on page 19 MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 280 August 1991"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"Current Case Log Donald Ware The following summarizes case reports received in May and June 1991 which are well prepared and represent recent events of significance to UFOIogy. Unless noted, no sound, vibration or odor was detected. • Log #910701E: 75 May 91, sighting at 10:35 a.m. near West Middlesex, PA; investigator Stan Gordon. The witness and his young stepdaughter were driv- ing through farm country near their home when they observed a large blimp-like object for about three minutes. It was dull gray, and had two appendages on the bottom, and was sur- rounded by a mist. The center appeared \"funny\" and showed every color of the rainbow. It moved slowly, dipped down in front, and made them feel uneasy. They rushed home and came back five minutes later with a camera, but it was gone. They were both quite disturbed by the incident for several days. • Log #910702E: 8 Jim. 91, sighting at 9:30 a.m. two miles north of Port Crane, NY by a 26-year-old woman; in- vestigator Douglas K. Dains. Witness was driving north when she saw a white domed disk 45° to the left about 1500 feet away. It crossed the road in front of her as it climbed to the NE and went out of sight in about one minute. It ap- peared four times the size of the full moon. • Log #910703E: 3 Mar. 91, sighting at 10:20p.m., 12 miles west oflthica, NY by four ladies employed at Cornell University; investigator Hal Haglund. While driving, witnesses saw a triangular object with a red glow and three lights, two green and one red. The red light was surrounded by a whitish light. The object crossed the road and descended vertically over a wooded hill less than 1/2 mile away. There were four shadowy grayish triangles pro- truding. The witnesses got out of the car and observed white lights behind the trees for about 10 minutes. After- ward, the driver felt disoriented, one felt warm for two hours, and one had eye irritation for a day. • Log #910707E: 4 Feb. 91, 7:45p.m. sighting by three ladies near Stroudsburg, PA; investigator Charles Decker. One witness called her neigh- bor to look outside. She and her daughter saw a huge rectangular object with many yellowish-white and red lights move silently overhead. They said it was half the size of a football field. The object was seen again later that night. • Log #910709E: 21 Oct. 90, sight- ing at 5:45 a.m. for about 15 minutes by a 27-year-old man near Halifax, MA; investigator Diana DeSimone. The witness was a deer hunter waiting for the sun to rise when he saw a general- ly spherical white object with a bulg- ing red light on the left and a bulging blue light on the right. It appeared the size of the full moon as it hovered just above the trees to the south. Then it zig-zagged up and stopped abruptly. The object had a black, diamond- shaped spot in the middle that repeated- ly flashed on and off. When it zig- zagged back down to its original posi- tion, he became afraid and got back in his car and left. The witness apparent- ly has an hour of missing time. • Log #910710E: 19 Dec. 90, sighting at 5:40 p.m. 4.8 miles east of Chester, VTby a couple on their way to a din- ner appointment; investigator Diana DeSimone. The object was a narrow, black, boomerang shape with a span of 150-200 yards. They stopped the car, stuck their heads out the window and watched it slowly pass across the road 500 feet in front of them. It was about 200 feet above the ground. There was a white, hemispherical light on the top surface near each of the three points. The right light blinked while the other two were steady. Each light was at least 18 feet across and appeared to be a \"cluster\" of smaller lights stacked on top of each other. When they got back on the road to pursue the object, it sud- denly reversed direction and crossed the road behind them, entered some low clouds and disappeared about seven minutes after first being sighted. The male witness is the subject of a prior UFO abduction investigation. The previous month a similar craft was seen by other witnesses nearby. • Log #910711E: 12 Feb. 91, sighting at 1:40 a.m. by a 41-year-old medical illustrator while driving on Route 90 west of Westfield, MA; investigator Diana DeSimone. A dark narrow, boomerang-shaped object appearing 20 times the size of the full moon was observed in a starlit sky. It was estimated to be larger than a Boeing 747 and about 2300 feet away at its closest. There was a large off-white light at each of the three corners. The witness is a subject of a prior UFO abduction case. A similar object was reported in Ver- mont in November and December of 1990; and, perhaps coincidentally, one of those witnesses was a subject of the same abduction case. • Log #910713E: 8 Jan. 84, sighting about 3:00 a. m. by a 34-year-old man from his bedroom window at Fram- ingham, MA; investigator Joe Nyman. The witness woke feeling paralyzed, with a pencil-thin beam of green light coming through the open window behind his head, apparently \"reflect- ing\" off the ceiling and entering his right eye. His eye burned as he strug- gled to move. When he was able to slightly move his head, the beam quick- ly re-entered his eye. He got the men- tal impression his mind was being read. He saw, \"somehow reflected\" from the ceiling, the window behind him with a small head and hand pointing the light. He heard a humming that MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 280 August 1991"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"changed pitch sinusoidally. After about two minutes the beam and noise stopped, and he could move. When he looked out the window, a green, self- illuminated cylinder about 3' by 18 \"- diameter with three orange legs was rising vertically. It went out of sight in less than a second. It was estimated to be 40 feet away. • Log #910714E: Jan. 91, sighting at 8:30p.m. by a 32-year-old computer technician in Arlington, MA; inves- tigator Leonard Silverman. Two glow- ing, greenish, boomerang-shaped objects with three bright spots came from the SW in formation. One stopped abruptly in the starlit sky while the other did a loop to the north; and, when it reached its original position with respect to the other, both flew together east over Boston. The entire event took only 10 seconds. They were last. • Log #910716E: 10 Jan. 91, sighting at 8:30p.m. by a young couple driv- ing north on 1-95 near the Mass. /New Hampshire state line; investigator Paul Rosenfield. The object was seen for about three minutes hovering about 100 feet above the highway as they drove under it. They were afraid to stop, although two other cars had pulled over to the side. The object was gray and domed on the top, with three round, red lights forming a triangle centered on the circular flat bottom. The lights con- tinually blinked in sequence. The ob- ject was a bit larger than a standard car. Two other UFO sightings were reported in that general area that night. • Log #910801E: 10 Jun. 91, two- second sighting at 2:00 a.m. by a 33-year-old programmer at Honeoye Falls, NY; investigator Tom Nesser. An elliptic white light, with sharply defined edges appearing the size of a thumb- nail at arm's length, moved across the sky at about 40 degrees per second. It made an instant change of direction before it was lost from view behind a tree. It appeared as bright as a 100-watt bulb at 30 feet. BLUEBERRY UFO Leland Bechtel  Robert MacKenna J ust after dark, at 5:30 p.m., on Friday, November 2, 1990, Warren Orcutt and his wife Velma were returning to their home in Cherryfield Maine. They had been winterizing their \"camp\" on remote Schoodic Lake in the blueberry country of the north- eastern part of the state. Traveling in then- Ford diesel pickup truck down the dirt road that ran through the blueberry barrens eight miles east of their home, they approached the intersection of the outskirts of Cherryfield, Columbia and Township 18 in Washington County. As they neared a bend in the road, Velma's attention was caught by lights shining through the leafless trees. \"What is it?\" exclaimed Velma. \"That's Tibbettstown,\" responded Warren. \"No, it's not,\" Warren stated emphatically. They rounded the bend turning toward their left, and the object became apparent. Passing around the trees that jutted out from a forested area between the blueberry fields and the Great Heath (a vast marshy area toward the Northeast), they confronted, in front of them and slightly to the left, a saucer- like object 60 feet in diameter rising slowly from the earth. It was 25 minutes after sunset. Although it was partially enshrouded in the ground mist, three brilliant swiveling lights could be seen on the lower part of the object rotating with the craft in a counter-clockwise direction, il- luminating the trees and ground in a sweeping motion. The lights, about two feet in diameter (one green, one red and one white about 10-15 feet apart), were \"like landing lights of a big plane, ter- rifically bright, brighter than halogen\" to the point that they \"hurt the eyes.\" Warren brought their vehicle to a standstill, and they watched the object as it silently rose and stopped; then rose and stopped again \"as though it were trying to avoid striking the limbs of trees\" at the edge of the barren. He then drove their truck a few hun- dred feet further down the road to a lit- tle higher point on the ridge for a bet- ter view. There he stopped the motor and turned off the lights while they listened, detecting no sound whatsoever as they continued to watch the hover- ing craft. At this point Velma went outside the truck to observe more closely. She and Warren were both able to see rec- tangular shaped windows in the side of the craft as it revolved. A dull, orange glow emitting from inside the windows was evident. For 10-15 minutes they watched as the craft hovered and then slowly moved upward in short spurts. Warren urged his wife to get back in- to the truck which she then did. Thereupon he started the truck and drove further down the road to an isolated house occupied by the Cotton family. Warren rushed to the house, pounded on the door, and informed the residents of the still visible object. Together they watched as the craft rose further in steps well above the tree line. It then shot off in horizontal movement at \"terrific speed\" in a northeasterly direction toward the massive radar site in Columbia Falls 10-12 miles away. Other people on Route 9, in the direc- tion the craft went, reported seeing a similarly described object at about the same time. Other Witnesses Upon arriving home, Velma prompt- ly phoned a young man in the neigh- borhood who, along with two friends in a pick-up truck on their way from the city of Bangor to their \"camp,\" had reported an experience with a UFO two years earlier. Velma said that she wanted to assure him that she believed him because she had now seen the same thing.

Ed Komarek, Jr., Georgia State Section Director F rom May 15 through June 13, 1991, I traveled and lectured in the U.S.S.R. My lecture was primarily on the UFO literature avail- able in the United States. I spent a lot of time with the grass roots organiza- tions in Yeisk and Krasnodar. Through these groups and Boris Shurinov in Moscow, I obtained a fair understanding of what is going on in the field of UFOlogy in the Soviet Union. The first thing one has to realize is that nearly everything in the Soviet Union is controlled by the government. UFOlogy is no exception. The UFO leadership is appointed by the government to manage the local organizations that are required to register with the official national UFO organization in order to be legal. Not all groups are registered, but 89 have. I have this list. I was told it does not include some groups in the Ukraine. The two or- ganizations that I spent the most time with were the ones in \"reisk and Krasno- dar that are on this officially approved list. Since the local groups do not trust the official UFO leadership, they are not for- warding the cases they collect to the top, but to stronger UFO groups in various regions such as the group in Kiev which has over 5,000 cases now on record. In October there will be a meeting of the local groups in which they will try to organize and develop their own leader- ship. How far the government will allow them to proceed is open to question. Not only in UFOlogy but in many other areas, individuals and groups are ques- tioning imposed authority and trying to develop democratic organizations. At this time it appears to me that the official UFO leadership is becoming in- creasingly isolated from the local groups and consequently the data that is being collected. For instance, a Russian press representative touring and lecturing in the U.S.A., said that in Russia \"The people are invited on board, not abducted.\" But on Moscow television, a man testified to having been abducted against his will. There are actually many cases of peo- ple being abducted against their will in the U.S.S.R., as well as some apparent- ly being invited on board. American UFOlogists should be careful of pro- nouncements by official U.S.S.R. UFO spokespersons because, as best, they are either simply uninformed or perhaps are deliberately providing disinformation. It should also be realized that the peo- ple coming to the U.S. in the field of UFOlogy have the blessing and financial help from the Soviet Government. Most UFO investigators and researchers can- not afford the airline fare and must be invited with a formal invitation available from the U.S. State Department. It should be recognized that the investi- gators with the most experience and knowledge have not been able to present their views to the American public. It is my opinion that in the not too dis- tant future the Soviet government may find that they are unable to manage public awareness effectively with a for- mal government controlled UFO organization. As was the case of Pro- ject Blue Book, the very fact that the government was involved gives credibili- ty to the subject. I expect Soviet officials to follow the lead of the Americans and disavow that \"UFOs are real.\" Then they can carry on their secret work without the public's knowledge just like the Americans. Already Dr. Azhazha is talking about cutting off government help to the newly formed UFO groups. I wouldn't be surprised if Azhazha becomes a debunker and follows the lead of Philip Klass. I hope this does not happen and that the Soviet govern- ment faithfully follows its dictate of open-mindedness and restructuring. I believe that the Soviet government has a lot less to lose by revealing what they know about UFOs because every- body in the U.S.S.R. knows who is in control. In the United States, it is a very different matter. For those Americans who believe that they are in control, they are going to have quite a shock when it is revealed to what extent the American public has been deceived by their own government. This scandal will dwarf all prior scandals in American history. The general public in the U.S.S.R. is much more open and interested in UFOs. There are many UFO publica- tions in the U.S.S.R. but some are not of good quality. These publications print everything they can get their hands on and are not very discriminating. There is money to be made from UFO infor- mation in the U.S.S.R., unlike the situa- tion in the states where one is apt to lose more money than one makes by becom- ing involved with the subject of UFOs. In the U.S.S.R, U.S. tabloid fabri- cated stories are printed alongside more serious works without any discrimina- tion. There is a great need for high quality publications in the Soviet Union. Part of the reason for my trip was to deliver 140 pounds of books, magazines, proceedings, journals, etc. to competent UFO researchers in the Soviet Union. MUFON presented copies of all of the annual MUFON Symposium Proceedings from 1975 through 1990 to the Yiesk Club of Ab- normal Phenomena. In summary, I am quite pleased with the rapid development of the field of UFOlogy in the Soviet Union. It must be realized that things are still in a for- mulative period, because until recently serious study of the UFO subject was outlawed by the government. Soviet UFOlogy is still very fragmented with many restrictions of information through- out the field. The professionals and the amateurs must learn to get along better and work out their differences. Profes- sionals and amateurs need each other for an effective intelligence gathering, pro- cessing, and distribution operation to work. In due time important information will be contributed by the Soviet Ufologists to the worldwide data base.

About 10:30 a.m. he heard a \"swishing\" noise, looked up and observed \"an object descending at an angle of about 45-degrees, traveling at a high rate of speed and coming to a complete stop very close to the ground.\" While hover- ing it was joined by a second object. Both objects then turned on edge and \"shot up at a steep angle, from almost stationary to an instant 500 mph.\" Both craft appeared \"lens-like or disc- shaped\" and there appeared to be a \"button, or some small protrusion on the upper side as viewed edge-on.\" Several other people on the ranch witnessed the objects.

The craft had been in sight only a few seconds but they got a good look at it because it was low. It was the shape of a \"flying wing\" and one-and-a-half times bigger than a B-36 bomber. The wing was sharply swept back, almost like a \"V.\" Both the husband and wife had seen B-36s over their home many times. They couldn't see the color of the craft but they did notice that there were dark bands running across the wing from front to back.

His home was three miles south of Americus, Georgia. \"We noticed over the far end of a field a light going back and forth, left to right, above the trees about the width of the field. Suddenly, it seemed to be com- ing toward us. It finally stopped, and there was no sound. Then the first thing happened that really scared us. This thing just turned a brilliant white ... it was extremely bright. The brilliant whiteness began to dull, to tone down to about a blacksmith's horseshoe red, like when you pull a piece of iron out of the fire. For the first time I could see its outline. It appeared to be a disc- shaped object 30 to 50 feet in diameter that was between 50 to 100 yards away. Then it began to move very slowly back in the other direction. Two other lights rose up from the other side of the trees and the three objects moved off to the southwest.\" Charles Kohlhase was the mission design manager of the Voyager space mission at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory.

As you know, some 30 or more coun- tries are taking part in what is technical- ly known as Project Vanguard. That project is the launching of those 20-inch globes into outer space next year by this country as a part of its participation in the International Geophysical Year. WSMB has been told by some of the highest ranking government officials in this country that the Air Force, in spite of claims to the contrary, is vitally con- cerned about UFOs. Publicly, the Air Force has never denied that these fly- ing discs could be space ships from other planets. \"Next year, when those Earth satellites are shot out beyond the Earth's atmosphere, at least two, and possibly more of them, will be equipped with special electronic instruments which will be used to study UFOs when they are observed. Top scientists are con- vinced, even though no public an- nouncement has been made, that the Earth is under constant surveillance by these vessels from outer space, and it is for this reason that at least two of those multi-million dollar Earth satellites will be especially equipped to study the so-called UFOs. Recent developments internationally,\" Shirley concluded, \"have more than ever con- vinced many of the world's top scien- tists that the world must make every ef- fort to contact these UFOs, and their pilots and crew members.\" (Flying Saucers, by Max Miller) • On the 13th, in the vicinity of Lakenheath-Bentwaters, England, oc- curred one of the most baffling series of UFO radar-visual contacts ever to confront Air Force radar operators. About 10:30 p.m. an unknown lighted object was observed from the tower of an RAF base. It was also tracked by three Radar Air Traffic Control Centers. An RAF Venom jet fighter was scrambled to intercept, and the pilot closed in on the UFO, guided by RATCC's Station A. Seconds later, the pilot radioed control that his guns were locked on the object (by radar). Instantly, the UFO whipped around behind the interceptor. The amazingly swift maneuver was confirmed by the USAF sergeant, who had been watch supervisor at Station A that night. He also described the pilot's frantic at- tempts to shake off his pursuer. MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 280 August 1991"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"Despite the pilot's hasty maneuvers, the UFO stayed close behind him, matching every turn. At control, operators could tell from his tense voice that the pilot was badly frightened. When the jet ran low on fuel another Venom was scrambled. The first pilot radioed a quick warning as the second plane took off, admitting he was com- pletely helpless against the UFO. The second jet was hardly airborn when it developed trouble and was forced to land. An American T-33 pilot tried an interception but the UFO raced out of the area. A minute later a C-47 pilot reported that the unknown craft had just streaked under his plane, and RAF tower operators had a blurred glimpse as the UFO went past. From the visual reports, it was estimated to be flying at more than 2000 mph and possibly as high as 4000 feet. In the Condon Committee Report, separate evaluations were made by two project scientists familiar with radar. Quoting from official logs, the first analyst stressed the UFO's amazing ac- celeration and high-speed turns. Three radar stations, he emphasized, had tracked the UFO simultaneously — proof that an unknown object was over the area. The analyst's final conclusion was: \"It was highly probable that a gen- uine UFO was involved.\" But the se- cond scientist's conclusion stated that \"a mechanical device — origin unknown — was the most probable answer.\" The report by the night-watch supervisor in the Radar Air Traffic Control Center at Lakenheath-was not to be found in the Blue Book file by the Condon Committee in 1967, but it was contained in the files released in 1976 by the Air Force. (The Hynek UFO Report, by J. Allen Hynek; Aliens From Space, by Donald Keyhoe) 1961 • The principal witness for this case was awakened from his sleep about 3:30 a.m. on the eighth. He could clearly make out two beings who were standing near him, one at the foot, 'the other at the head of the bed. He strug- gled to get up but felt paralyzed and could only wonder at what was going on in front him. Strangely, he felt con- tent and fearless as the two figures spoke to each other and then to him. The two beings were small, four or five feet tall at the most, and were smartly dressed in a two-piece suit of soft, dark- colored cloth-like material with a belt around the middle. Each had a face helmet or glass bubble pushed back behind his head. The being at the head of the bed appeared older and had a receding hair line. Both were \"beau- tifully proportioned.\" Neither walked, but floated through the air. Both figures spoke with the man for what seemed a minute. Suddenly, one of the visitors said to the other, \"I think he's waking up on us, we'd better go.\" The two beings then just disappeared in front of the astonished man. As this happened a hissing sound could be heard. As the two figures disappeared, the man's paralysis disappeared. He jumped out of bed and ran outdoors but saw nothing. He returned to the bedroom to find that his wife also had been awakened by the beings. She, too, felt paralyzed as she could do nothing but watch. Unknown to both witnesses at the time, a neighbor was awakened at the same time and looked out his window and observed a brilliant bluish globe-shaped object in front of the cou- ple's house. The craft appeared to be at least 25 feet in diameter, and slowly lifted off the ground and gradually ac- celerated to the north. (The APRO Bulletin, April 1977) 1966 • At 5:00 p.m. on the 19th, a member of the U.S. Border Patrol was driving near Donnybrook, North Dakota, about 39 miles northwest of Minot, when all of a sudden the Border Patrol radio in the patrol car \"developed a high-pitched whining sound and a series of beeps.\" He tried to adjust the radio, but could not stop the in- terference. About this time, he noticed a flash of bright light out to the left. Then is when he noticed \"an object on its edge floating down the side of a hill, rocking from side-to-side about 10 feet from the ground.\" The patrolman stopped the car and got out for a better view. When the UFO reached the valley floor, it climbed to about 100 feet, still tipped on its edge, and moved across the valley to a small reservoir. The craft then turned to a horizontal position and a small dome became visible on top. The object was disc-shaped, about 30 feet in diameter and 15 feet thick in the center, and \"appeared to be a bright, highly polished metal.\" The vehicle hovered over the water for about three minutes, then moved to a small field, where it appeared to be landing. It did not touch the ground, however, but hovered at a height of about 10 feet some 250 feet away from the officer, who was now standing by his parked patrol car. He could hear no sound coming from the UFO. The in- terference on the Border Patrol radio was louder than ever at this point, still beeping and whining. After about a minute, the craft then tilted up and disappeared into the clouds in a mat- ter of a few seconds. The witness had the object under observation for about 10 minutes. While it was on edge mov- ing across the valley floor, it appeared to have a circular black spot in the center of the underside about 10 feet in diameter, \"with three smaller round ob- jects around the edge of the black spot.\" The three objects appeared to be about a foot in diameter and were also like a silvery metal in color. On the following day, the officer and a friend returned to the site to check the ground where the UFO had passed at low altitude. On the side of the hill they found hundreds of boulders and rocks which \"had been pulled right out of their sockets and turned under-side up. The dirt on the under-side of them was still damp, as were the holes where they were resting in the side of the hill. Some of the boulders were of good size and weight. The boulders and rocks were in this pattern for about half the way down the hill in about a 30-foot swath,\" the officer reported. On the top of the hill they found a flat area with grass about a foot tall. The officer said that \"right in the middle of the flat area, there were three round depressions in the ground in a triangular pattern where the grass was completely worn away. Each was about 14 inches in diameter. The three spots were impressed about three or four inches into the ground. We also noticed that the grass seemed to be trampled down in spots around the MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 280 August 1991"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"top of the hill.\" (Lengthy report from Border Patrol officer, 10/23/66) • On the 25th, an Air Force officer in charge of a missile crew near Minot, North Dakota, suddenly found that his radio transmission was being inter- rupted by static. At the time he was sheltered in a concrete capsule 60 feet below the ground. While he was try- ing to clear up the problem, other Air Force personnel on the surface reported seeing a UFO high in the sky. It had a bright red light, and it appeared to be alternately climbing and descending. Simultaneously, a radar crew on the ground picked up the UFO at 100,000 feet. \"When the UFO climbed, the static stopped,\" stated the report made by the base's director of operations. \"The UFO began to swoop and dive. It then appeared to land 10 to 15 miles south of the area. \"Missile-site control sent a strike team (well-armed Air Force guards) to check. When the team was about 10 miles from the landing site, static disrupted radio contact with them. Five to eight minutes later the glow diminished, and the UFO took off. Another UFO was visually sighted and confirmed by radar. The one that was first sighted passed beneath the second. Radar also confirmed this. The first made for altitude toward the north, and the second seemed to disappear with the glow of red.\" (The Saturday Even- ing Post magazine, 12/17/66) 1976 • Two young men were sitting on the hood of a car parked in the driveway of a private residence at Hart- ford, South Dakota, about 11:30 p.m. on the 18th. They noticed two extreme- ly bright lights descending toward them. They immediately became alarmed thinking an airplane was about to crash nearby. One ran under the soffet of the house and the other ran away from the house. At that point a craft with two bright lights stopped directly over the house at treetop level, hovered briefly, then moved about 10 yards north of the house, and stopped again. The UFO was now about 40 feet away from the boy furthest from the house. The two bright lights were blinding him. The second boy moved away from the house and could clearly see a diamond- shaped craft about 45 feet long and 45 feet wide, silver-gray in color and a non-glossy finish. Suddenly an open- ing appeared \"and some type of mechanical arm lowered itself through the opening. The arm had a red light on the end which flashed twice very quickly, then returned within the vehi- cle.\" Then the UFO tipped downward a few feet in the front, in a landing posi- tion, and moved across a golf course which was adjacent to the house. The beams from the two bright lights on the craft \"were all over the golf course\" as if they were searching for something. It then moved out of sight. (Police Department Report, 8/20/76) 1981 • David John Santoro, 27, a Spring Valley, California reserve police officer, was driving near Alpine about 10:30 p.m. on the 30th when he saw something that indelibly marked his life. Hovering 15 feet above the road was a huge, dark, disc-shaped object at least 60 feet wide, about the size of a railroad freight car. His car came to an instantaneous halt, even though he did not apply the brakes. There was a brilliant glow, as if a continuous flash- bulb had gone off in his face. Then two small beings removed him from the car. Not more than 15 minutes later, he found himself back in his moving vehi- cle. The strange dark object rose rapid- ly, shining a beam of white light on the ground around the car in circles. He fired four shots at the craft with his ser- vice revolver out the left window and drove home wildly at 90 mph, narrowly escaping an accident. David arrived home clearly terrified, locked the door and grabbed a gun, say- ing: \"They're out there. They're going to get me.\" Then — the man described as an extremely stable person with the bearing of a Marine — rolled up on the sofa, telling his wife, \"I'm going crazy. I'm crazy.\" Later that night Santoro in- spected his brand new Chevy Malibu. The headlights were dim, the engine was difficult to start, the alternator light would not go out. Magnetic cassette tapes in the car were partially erased. The car had been dirty before the ex- perience, but the front end afterwards was clean. The man's wrists and ankles showed signs of abrasion. Later, under hypnosis, David refused to describe the beings or talk about what happened when they took him, saying he had orders not to talk about it. After six years of strained credibility with his neighbors, Santoro moved to another state for a fresh start. (National UFO Reporting Center, 91 1 /81; The Tribune, San Diego, CA, 7/1/87) UFO PRESS, Continued referred to only as \"a British re- searcher\" whose theory \"attributes the circles to electrically charged vortices of wind.\" It's not that the article itself is necessarily bad (the pictures, of course, are quite good), but rather the mis- guided impression that the whole sub- ject is best approached as silly season fodder that leaves such an unpleasant taste in the mouth.

Salisberry in the June MUFON Journal. Usually I ignore personal opinions but in this case the Salisberrys have not been honest with your readership. Their letter is full of misquotes and false statements. Here are some examples: (1) The Salisberrys are guilty of quoting only part of the MUFON spon- sored PSE (lie detection test). The com- plete sentence says, \"The rest of the in- terview, from the stand point of being able to say he (Ed Walters) is being truthful about what he saw arid what he did, does not show any reactions to cause this examiner to doubt his answers. I have taken and passed four lie detector tests administered by three dif- ferent examiners, all of whom have signed their reports. (2) The Salisberrys say that my photo 19 is fake, based on \"three PhD-level Photo Analysts\" but these \"experts\" seem to have no names. They should be named if we are expected to believe they exist. (3) The Salisberrys also say that my photo 19 is fake based on the camera elevation which they say is 5.4 feet from the ground. Photo 17 was taken from inside my truck showing the hood and windshield wiper. The truck measures 5.75 feet from ground to cab headlines The camera measures .33 inches from lens to view finder. This leaves a grand total of one inch for the photographer to squeeze his head between the truck's roof and the camera view finder. (Ah, the last time I measured, my head was bigger than one inch.) As Dr. Maccabee calculated, the cor- rect camera elevation is about 4.1 feet, at which level the windshield wiper can be seen. The point here is that the Salisberrys' opinion means nothing. Anybody can misquote and make up numbers. (4) In April of 1990, Rex Salisberry told other MUFON Investigators (Bruce Morrision, etc.) that he had seen the \"Gulf Breeze type\" UFO. That makes him a witness to the UFO that I photographed. (You figure that one out.) Either he was confused about see- ing the UFO then, or he is confused about it being a hoax now. I first met the Salisberrys as members of an abductee support group. Ms. Salisberry explained away UFOs as a psychological phenomena, and Mr. Salisberry told a story about his \"live- in invisible alien who drinks his mouth wash.\" Maybe UFOs do have a psychological connection and maybe the Salisberrys do have a \"live-in alien,\" I don't know. But what I do know is that I really don't care what their opinion is about what I have seen, and I only respond because of their ef- forts to influence others with misquotes and made up \"facts.\" — Ed Walters Gulf Breeze, FL Dear Editor: Several months ago I was reviewing videotapes of TV shows to find testi- mony by Gulf Breeze witnesses who claim that they saw a UFO of the \"Ed\" type. I combined the short video segments together to show during my presentation at the MUFON Sym- posium. Those who attended my lec- ture saw testimony by witnesses who have appeared in several TV interviews (the Somerbys, Huffords, McConnells, Jeff Thompson, etc.) The attendees also saw the testimony of a \"surprise\" witness (at least I was surprised when I found his interview). The surprise witness is Rex Salisberry. In my sym- posium paper (\"Gulf Breeze without Ed\") I listed about a dozen witnesses who have said they saw the same thing that Ed photographed. However, I did not discover Rex's testimony until after I had completed the writing of my Sym- posium paper, so I wish to place it on record here, as it has some bearing on his recent letter (MUFON Journal, June 1991) in which he claims that Ed's sightings are a hoax. During his interview for the \"Cur- rent Affair\" TV show that was aired in February or March of 1990 (I don't know the exact date), Rex, in the com- pany of his wife and Gary Watson, was asked by interviewer Vince Lapari, \"What makes you so sure (you saw a UFO)?\" Rex answered as follows: \"Because you could compare it with the stars, the planets ... it was larger than stars or planets. And later on I saw the photographs that Ed took and what he had on the photographs looked ex- actly like what I saw.'' (my emphasis) Those who have argued that the sightings and photos are all part of a grand hoax by Ed and his family (Ed is not alone in this) have not given due consideration to all of the other witnesses. As I have described in my Symposium paper, these witnesses responded to the hoax allegations that were put forth in the spring of 1990 by reaffirming their statements that they had seen the same thing that appears in Ed's photos. If Ed's photos and sightings were removed from considera- tion, there would still be a substantial body of testimonial evidence to indicate that an \"Ed type\" UFO was seen in the Gulf Breeze area in 1987 and 1988. The most recent sighting of this type was by two witnesses last November (1990). Apparently the object is not confined to the Gulf Breeze area. Ed has received letters from people scattered throughout the country who also claim to have seen it in years past. Furthermore, those who claim it is all a hoax have not explained the oc- currence of hundreds of other sightings in the area of objects or lights, some of which, judging from their descrip- tions, were similar to the \"Ed type\" and many of which are different but unex- plained (such as triangular arrays of lights). Nor have they offered any reasonable explanations for the current rash of sightings that started in April 1990, stopped until November, and then resumed at such a rate that well over four dozen sightings have occurred since November. Any credible skeptic who wishes to argue that all these sightings are hoaxes and misidentifica- tions must directly confront these MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 280 August 1991"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"numerous multiple witness sightings which are accompanied by photos and videotapes. — Bruce Maccabee Sabillasville, MD Dear Editor: Thank you for your excellent publica- tion, and in particular the recent focus on the Crop Circles. It is truly remarkable how sometimes the most obvious explanation to a mystery is the one often rejected or debased as a possibility — in this case, how can anyone explain away the Crop Circles as anything but UFO related? These images are decidedly \"created\" from above, from overhead, not unlike the images on the Nazca Plains in the Andes from so many cen- turies ago. The Circles are obviously the work of an \"intelligence,\" as their formations are not random, nor are they without \"meaning.\" That we humans have yet to decode this meaning is not impor- tant. The fact that so many people are at work trying to figure it out itself im- plies that there is something to decipher. One thing that has yet to be pointed out, it seems to me, is how benign are these agriglyphs. They are not threaten- ing in any-way; they are both humble and majestic at the same time.

Eric Herr, 619-583-8247 or P.O. Box 15044, San Diego, CA 92175. — Eric Herr Dear Editor: I was very interested to read Richard Andrews' letter to the MUFON UFO Journal (June 1991). Richard has done a great deal of hard work investigating crop circles and rarely receives the recognition he deserves for his sterling efforts. I was however surprised to see him continuing to promote the myth of progressivity with his claim that quin- tuplet patterns first appeared in 1983 and that ringed circles first appeared in 1986. At CERES (the Circles Effect Research group) we accept that the issue of progressivity is quite critical for the crop circle debate. Nevertheless Andrews appears to be unaware of the double ringed circle events published in BUFORA's 1989 report Controversy of the Circles, which detailed our in- vestigations into the events at Evenlode in 1960 and Twywell in 1978. At a public lecture held last August, Colin Andrews repeated his claim to have a photograph of a quintuplet event from 1978. We drew attention to this claim in our book Crop Circles, A Mystery Solved (Robert Hale, 1990), along with a possible quintuplet pattern at Langen- burg, Saskatchewan, Canada from 1974. We challenge Colin Andrews to publish this photograph in the CPR newsletter to finally disprove the false claim being made that quintuplets and ringed circles were part of an \"evolv- ing\" phenomenon. Although Richard Andrews claims that the 1990 formations displayed a \"complete departure from the tradi- tional configurations,\" some 70 percent of the 1990 formations known to CERES were simply single circles, although perhaps 90 percent of the media publicity concentrated solely on the most complex \"pictogram\" formations. — Paul Fuller CERES Hampshire BLUEBERRY UFO, Continued the present investigators if they had ex- perienced any ridicule, they hesitated briefly but then responded that any in- credulity on the part of people was in good humor \"because these things are now commonly seen on the barrens.\" They further cited by name the case of an individual who reported that he was working in an irrigation ditch when a UFO landed a few hundred feet from him. He observed it briefly and then continued working. Eventually it took off and left the scene. Other sightings continue to be reported. The credibility of the witnesses in- volved in this sighting is exceedingly high.

News from MUFON Board Meeting The Board extended the leave of absence of Dan Wright until the 1992 Board Meeting in Albuquerque, NM at his request. Richard F.

The symposium was an im- mense success, even though lightning in a severe electrical storm struck a major power distribution center knocking out the AC power in Rosemont, creating a power interruption from 8 a.m. to 4:15 p.m. at the hotel. Hotel emergency power operated the four major elevators in the lobby, however all other electrical devices and air conditioning were inoperative. The host committee and the hotel im- provised with other accommodations utilizing natural light and outside ventila- tion where available for the speakers and participants. We must commend every attendee for their gracious and good-natured accept- ance of the hotel blackout; a condition beyond the control of anyone. Everything returned to normal at 4:15 p.m., whereby the speakers were again able to use slide projectors and have a public address system at their disposal. Ronald Wolfe continued to videotape the speakers dur- ing the blackout, since his people were equipped with portable battery packs for their cameras and floodlights. Bruce Maccabee, Gene Phillips, Busty Taylor and Richard Andrews completed their video and slide presentation after the power was restored, continuing well past the scheduled adjournment time. Only the people who had late afternoon or ear- ly evening flight departures missed the latter speeches. The program was revised to accom- modate an additional crop circle slide presentation by Busty Taylor and Richard Andrews from England on Sunday. Forest Crawford substituted for Prof. Jean-Pierre Petit from France who did not arrive in Chicago as scheduled for John S. Carpenter Director for Abduction Research unknown reasons. Prof. Petit's published paper is included in the symposium pro- ceedings. We hope to publish Forest Crawford's speech in a forthcoming issue of the Journal at the request of a majority of attendees. Again, an appreciated thank you to all the participants who braved the act of nature. You are the greatest.

MUFON Souvenirs The Mutual UFO Network has refrained from cornmercializing and sell- ing MUFON or UFO souvenirs, how- ever, as in the past, we support this ac- tivity by a few of our members as a con- venience to interested people. Baseball caps, T-shirts, coffee mugs, bumper stickers, etc., have always been popular items for sale at UFO symposia and con- ferences throughout the years. James S. Greenen displayed and sold current items at the 1991 symposium. Anyone in- terested in purchasing approved MUFON souvenirs may write and request an order form from International UFO Center, 1J955 S.
