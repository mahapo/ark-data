FROM THE EDITOR Certain segments of society, like the stock market, have always seen their popularity rise and fall. Jocks, soldiers and traveling salesmen, for example, have been both revered and ridiculed; depending on the temper of the times and the unpredictability of popular fads. Bankers, journalists and politicians, barely tolerated one year, may be the darlings of the media another. -It should come as no surprise, then, that ufology and ufologists are subject to the same waxing and waning of public regard as virtually everything else. Unfortunately, we seem to have been in a waning period the few past years, partly because the idea of UFOs is so widely accepted and partly because we have been so lax in our own public relations. In the words of Rodney Dangerfield, \"we don't get no respect.\" Could it be we don't deserve it? I don't know, but I do know that there have been several encouraging trends already this year, which taken together, indicate that a fresh wind may be blowing our direction. For starters, there was the financial success of the 1984 Symposium, the sell-out first printing of Clear Intent, the impromptu \"town-hall\" meeting called in New York and attended by nearly 1000 people, and Marge Christensen's plan to sponsor a National UFO Week next summer. The key element in all these events, I think, was their address of the public's concerns and needs. The UFO skeptics have been tireless and aggressive in taking their case to the public at large. It is high time we did the same. And earned a little respect in the process. In this issue NEWS'N'NOTES    3 By Dennis W.

STACY Editor UNCLEAR INTENT In case you're wondering about the validity and/or necessity of Marge Christensen's program to educate the public about the UFO phenomenon, consider the following, which turned up in a recent letter from Barry Greenwood, co-author of Clear Intent: \"...Prentice-Hall severely underestimat- ed the demand for the book. As such, it totally sold out shortly after the Symposium and won't be in print again, at earliest, until September 9th for the softcover, and September 21st for the hardcover. I haven't had any kind of supply to move myself. \"Thanks for the fine article in the NY Tribune. You might be amused to know that Mass. MUFON called the Boston Globe book review editor to get Clear Intent reviewed. We mentioned the Tribune piece, among others. They said they review only books. with 'literary merit,\" and in reference to the Tribune story they said, 'Oh, that's that Moonie newspaper, ha, ha!' It was a waste of time.\" Since I wrote the article to which Barry referrred, I should perhaps be put out. Instead, I feel somewhat enlightened. At least now I know what kind of book the Boston Globe considers \"literary,\" never mind that the subject matter impacts on the psychological, social and political aspects of every living (and voting) American. I'm also encouraged by the realization that Bostonians can now look forward to reviews of only literary and meritorious manuscripts in their leading Sunday newspaper. I take it on faith that local readers will not be subjected to thumbnail sketches of books about John DeLorean, John Belushi, and the financial imbroglios of Geraldine Ferraro? Unless, of course, said books are .of \"literary merit\". And without being too paranoid, one wonders about the powers-that-be at Prentice-Hall. After reportedly citing \"unprecedented interest\" in Clear Intent, a documented expose of government and .military UFO cover- up, the publishers not only under- printed, but also cut back on their original publicity schedule. One hopes they were not gleaning their marketing information from the insightful reviewers at the Globe, but one can never be sure. *** Meanwhile, in what is surely a classical transposition of the national norm of liberal East Coast media vs. their supposed conservative counterparts in the south and west, it should be noted that the Dallas Morning News (Sunday, August 26) gave Clear Intent the headline and lead review in their weekly survey of paperbacks. The same issue also carried a joint New York Times and UPI article about the series of recent UFO sightings in Putnam and Westchester counties, New York. As a native Texan, I was always aware that the Lone Star state was bigger than Massachusetts. Now I'm begining to think it's more progressive and intellectually advanced as well. *** UFO investigators who lament the fact they they always appear on the scent \"after the event\" can take some solace from the Bord sighting reported in this issue. Sightings do happen to interested parties as well as to persons supposedly UFO-ignorant and therefore \"unprimed\". The key seems to be keeping an eye to the sky, night and day. ***. The Bord sighting, by the way, unspectacular as it is, is bound to raise the earthquake-earthlight question in these pages again. As proposed by Michael Persinger, Paul Devereux, and others, the theory basically says that some anomalous luminous phenomena may be attributable to tectonic strain within the earth's surface. It is the feeling here that the theory can no longer be dismissed out of hand. Instead, it is time to begin to consider the parameters of the phenomenon, particularly in terms of the potential percentage of UFO reports generated, and in regard, generally, to the possible interaction with, and/or influence of, human consciousness. Recurring \"ghost light\" phenomena, for example, would seem to be a prime target of future investigations in this area; either for those wishing to prove or disprove . the theory that what takes place deep within the earth's surface somehow has an energetic influence on or in its atmosphere and its present inhabitants. *** Ann Druffel also writes to offer a correction to the chemical formula that appeared in her article about mercury propulsion in the July-August issue of the Journal. The formula, in the middle column of page 16, should read: \"Hg 2 . 85 AsF 6 .\" Also, Ann said she would be glad to forward a copy of the original article in which the formula appeared to anyone who writes and encloses an SASE. *** MUFON 103 OLDTOWNE RD.

Both offices are represented on the Board of Directors, and Hall will vote on issues before the Board. The primary responsibility of the Director of Publications is coordination and editing of the annual MUFON UFO Symposium Proceedings. In addition, Hall will make recommendations on Journal policies and on possible MUFON special publications. As time permits, he will contribute writing and editing to MUFON publications. Hall has also accepted a position as Consulting Editor to the Center for UFO Studies, primarily to review manuscripts arid suggest editorial changes, and occasionally contribute to the Associate Newsletter and International UFO Reporter. In accepting the position as MFUON Director of Publications, Hall said: \"My time is limited, and I have an agreement with a Midwest publisher to do a children's book on UFOs, but I would like to do what I can to help editorially. The content of the annual symposium proceedings already is excellent. Any changes or improvements I might be able to make would be refinements of style and consistency based on my experience as a writer and technical editor. I do have some ideas for possible MUFON special publications too, and will contribute whatever I can.\" As editor of The UFO Evidence (NICAP, 1964), a contributor to the Encyclopedia Brittanica 1968 Book of the Year, Mysteries of the Skies: UFOs in Perspective (Prentice-Hall, 1968), and numerous articles and a major appendix in The Encyclopedia of UFOs (Doubleday, 1980), Hall had more than 20 years of UFO writing and editorial experience. He was MUFON UFO Journal editor from 1976 through 1983. \"I want to thank the MFUON Board for dedicating the 1984 MUFON UFO Symposium proceedings to me,\" he said. \"I am particularly gratified that the speakers addressed all of the thorny problems we all face in trying to sort the chaff from the wheat. They did riot supply all the 'answers,' but they certainly raised a, lot of intriguing questions that we need to resolve. That's what a symposium should be about: to focus attention on the . important issues, review the best evidence available, explore the possible answers, and encourage thorough scientific investigation to determine the truth.\" NEW JOURNAL EDITOR • •   . (  . Beginning with this issue the new editor of the Journal is freelance photojournalist Dennis Stacy, former Staff Writer and MUFON Director of Publications. Mr. Stacy was previously a Contributing Editor to \"Frontiers of Science\" and overseas correspondent for the Universe Shuppan-sha magazine group, Japan. His articles, interviews and photographs on a wide variety of subjects have appeared in numerous newspapers and magazines both here and abroad, most recently in the Japanese edition of OMNI. Mr. Stacy hopes to bring a calculated eclecticism to the Journal based on his years of experience as a freelance journalist and student of ufology. \"Although I'll be the new editor,\" Mr. Stacy said, \"I don't intend to editorialize too much. What I would rather do is provide a forum where all the varied and sometimes seemingly opposed aspects of this remarkable phenomenon can be put on public display. \"I've interviewed people in this field from Dr. Hynek and Hilary Evans to , James Oberg and astronomer Michael i. Hart, and the one thing I learned was to keep my own viewpoint in the background and let the person being interviewed speak for him or her self. I, hope to bring the same approach to the pages of the Journal.\" < The hew editor said he welcomes neatly typed, doublerspaced manuscripts on all facets of ufology, as well as letters of comment and criticism: \"No radical departures are planned,'' said Stacy, \"but I would like to know what the readers think of the job being done:\" UFO OLYMPIC CEREMONIES If you watched much of the recent ABC-TV broadcast of the XXffl Olympiad (and who didn't?), did you catch the grand finale closing ceremony?  ' The lights in Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum were dimmed and nearly 100,000 spectators reached for colored flashlights under their seats. Millions more watched live across the country and around the world as a gigantic, laser-bearing, music-blasting UFO descended in the middle of the playing . field and a 7-foot, 8-inch alien emerged with an extraterrestrial greeting. Both \"UFO\" and \"alien\" were the brainstorm of Hollywood producer David L. Wolper, who was in charge of the opening and closing Olympic ceremonies. In reality, the two-ton take- off of the UFO in \"Close Encounters of the Third Kind\" was suspended from a darkened, hovering (and unmarked?) helicopter. Still, the spectacle showed to what extent the idea of UFOs as extraterrestrial visitors has permeated and been accepted by the collective planetary consciousness. It also demonstrated that when it comes to special effects and cultural influence, Hollywood is still second to none."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"UFO TOWN-HALL MEETING: A CASE STUDY By LARRY W. BRYANT LESSER MYSTERY One of the lesser mysteries on the UFO scene goes like this: how come the various UFO-research conventions held during the past 20 years have produced a relatively sparse turnout -- both from the public-at-large and from the news media? If UFO encounters affect all walks of life (and they do), if UFO witnesses represent a growing subculture of the citizenry (and they do), and if the UFO subject still deserves its day in court (and it does)... then why can't the UFO research community produce conferences with enough appeal to pack 'em in at the auditorium doors? Just as there are no easy answers to the UFO problem itself, so, too, does the problem of UFO-conference turnout defy simple explanation! All the socio-political aspects come into play -- from the historically taboo nature of the subject among the press and intelligensia to the attitude of a government convinced that Father knows best as to what an unprepared public should or should not learn about such ostensible trivia as flying saucers. NEBRASKA TURNING POINT? Of course, last year's conference at the University of Nebraska helped point the way toward progress -- in that it inspired both the public and the media to start realizing that their vision has been obscured all these years by a thick layer of Federally, applied wool. With its revelations gleaned from the past several years of the UFO paper chase, the Nebraska event added its foot-in- the-door of the Cosmis Watergate: the back door, you might say. But now the front door has been set ajar, thanks in part to the UFO's themselves but also to the persistence and imagination of Peter A. Gersten. MILESTONE IN MAKING The UFOs in question, of course, are those that reportedly have found a home in the skies of New York's Westchester and Putnam Counties, as well as nearby areas of Connecticut, during the past 19 months. \"UFO Country\" I call it. And as such, it has tossed the little town of Brewster, N.Y., into the UFO limelight. Brewsterians, if that be the right expression, will be discussing for years to come the day their Wells Middle School played host to the world's largest \"UFO Town Meeting\": 12 hours of continuous time, in a public forum, for UFO witnesses to share their experiences; to explore the wide implications of a regional citizenry mobilized to act in the absence of governmental action; to compare notes on, and impressions of, specific incidents; to engage in a fellowship of heightened UFO awareness; to interact, one-on-one, in a sort of intellectual and emotional catharsis provided by this forum for the UFOrlorn public-at-large. Attended on a sunny, Saturday the 25th of August by more than 1,000 persons, including entire families and more than two dozen media people, the occasion quickly jelled as grass-roots networking at its best. No carnival atmosphere here, no huckstering of ideologies, no excessive merchandising of UFO-club paraphernalia. . .just a simple, almost spontaneous display of concern about a pressing public issue and the equally pressing lack of answers. DOCUMENTED TESTIMONY Dozens of UFO witnesses quietly, studiously consented . to fill out the UFO-sighting report form provided at the registration table. Some of them also chose to recount their stories openly with total strangers or with any of the omnipresent reporters. Others chose to let their completed report forms stand as their record of participation. FUTURE MODEL Through it all, conference director Gersten, world-famous for his UFO- related litigation during the past several years, achieved fame right there in his own backyard, where he works for a law firm in Tarrytown and operates a \"UFO Hotline\" from his home in Peekskill. It was the hotline - a specially installed telephone-message recorder accessible to the public - that became the pivot for the conference. Based on his periodic analysis of incoming calls, Gersten would issue UFO-activity status reports via notices printed in the local \"Pennysaver\" community newsletter. As the UFO D-Day at Brewster. approached, he would include in the notices various details on the upcoming conference. His earlier newspaper and radio interviews, along with announcement posters placed in public areas, rounded out all the publicity necessary to predict a huge turnout. With free admision for everyone, how did Gersten meet expenses? Simple: he allowed the sale of conference-related T-shirts, bumper stickers, and lapel buttons - the extra proceeds of which he donated to the Center for UFO Studies, for further research into the upstate-New York UFO-sighting crisis. All in all, it was a practical, logical approach to a gathering of that size, purpose, and content. . .and, as we see from the local, state and national news coverage, the rest is UFOlogical history."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"PHYSICAL TRACES: TRUTH OR CONSEQUENCES A New Look At Physical Trace Cases By MAURIZIO VERGA Mr. Verga is a member of Centra Ufologico Nazionale, Italy. Traces (i.e., imprints, marks and residues, on the ground arid vegetation) ought to provide physical proof of a tangible phenomenon interacting with our reality. Indeed it is probably the one aspect of UFO study (with the possible exception of photographs) which has enabled the ufologist to refute an interpretation in psychological terms. For traces imply that the phenomenon is not something perceived subjectively (belonging only to the senses of the witness), but truly something with physical attributes. This physical \"proof has been expedited by the \"extraterrestrialists\" as support for their contention that material UFOs (ie., \"spacecraft\") exist. The ETH (as belief in extraterrestrial origin is called) is plainly on the decline, and its proponents rely heavily on physical trace evidence to keep its tenets alive. Physical traces are often a very difficult problem for any conceptual theory. We have had, for example, propositions of an \"interdimensional entity\", able to assume physical characteristics, and the adoption of paranormal phenomena, such as poltergeists and psychokinesis, to explain the mechanics of trace creation. It is almost impossible to consider the phenomenon in terms of a hypothesis without taking account of the physical trace evidence. Trace evidence is one of many aspects of the phenomenon with a clearly contradictory nature. These contradictions may be used as a basis to propose a plural origin for the phenomenon; that is, several different manifestations as a specific function of specific conditions. It is enough in this context to consider those cases where a UFO is .seen on the ground arid yet apparently leaves no traces. In practice, certain UFOs leave physical traces, others do not. Even when we bear in mind that we are always dealing with witness accounts, often poorly investigated and without recourse to psychology or perception, it would still seem that the phenomenon (if objective) \\ does not display strict or consistent criteria. On the contrary its oriteria are highly changeable, probably because of a completely unknown \"something\" (which may well be linked with individual characteristics of the witness). Of course, if UFOs did have an entirely subjective origin, then the problem would immediately take on new dimensions. Aside from outright hoax traces, the remainder would presumably be made unconsciously. Absence of traces would be explicable in terms of a witness' inability to manufacture them, perhaps because unconsciously he is aware of his need to give evidence of his subjective experience. This hypothesis is admittedly improbable, although the belief that UFOs do produce traces is deeply rooted in the popular belief. We can question the opinion that traces provide proof of the material nature of the UFO phenomenon in two ways. Firstly, by considering natural phenomena capable of producing traces. Secondly, by considering the facts and figures, as well as the standards in practice, of present day field investigators. In nature there are several causes able to produce remarkably strange trace marks under certain circumstances. These include fungii, plant and grass sickness, lightning, animal habits, whirlwinds, tornadoes, rain, helicopter slipstreams, exfoliation and so on. Furthermore, the action of man on the environment can also result in traces... for example, cars, carts mowers, fires etc. Discovering such a trace after a focal UFO sighting can easily lead to their connection with \"alien activity\". Even in situations where no UFO was seen, the appearence of a trace (especially when circular) can reawaken distant memories in the collective consciousness of stereotyped flying saucers and their alleged effects. Both material and psychological (stimula- tion by a flap in the vicinity) factors may come into play. The existence of concrete evidence tends to make any case more credible, no matter how spurious it may be. Traces often are unusual, even if explicable. The cultural belief systems and possibly emotional states can soon lead to the creation of abstruse hypotheses and speculations, on the basis of natural or artificially produced explicable phenomena. These points are critical and must be carefuly born in mind. The discovery of a \"trace\" tends to set the witness thinking in terms of a UFO. And, of course, if there is a Type-1 sighting at the root of the discovery, he will often go to the area where he saw the UFO (either on the ground or passing by low- down) with a view to finding evidence of the reality of the experience. This is not only to prove what happened toothers, but often to prove it to himself. This intense desire to find proof can easily lead to him discovering a myriad of insignificant anomalies (e.g. a broken branch, an animal mark, the remains of a fire and so on) and relating them to the UFO. This is a typical scenario for UFO seen in the distance (where often the exact location of the landing or near-landing is not known anyhow). Less common is the deliberate false linking of spurious traces with a genuine (continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"TRACES, CONTINUED UFO (in order to make the sighting more believable). Even so, in my view, this latter scenario is feasible for many rational people who would normally not behave in this fashion. The above considered possibility must be taken very seriously when investigators do not follow-up the \"traces\", on site, and we merely rely on the word of the witness. When investigators do visit the site we should expect them to validate or invalidate the traces, but the reality of the matter is often rather different. Unfortunately, an investigator is usually on the same level as the witness, having the same unconscious needs and beliefs. He is usually unprepared in terms of scientific methodology. He may very strongly desire to present a \"classic\" case to his colleagues. He may have a belief system which includes the material reality of the the UFO phenomenon, thus anticipate trace evidence. All of these things lead him into frequent and serious errors. The investigator is lead desperately in search of traces to support his \"ambitions\" and \"needs\". Any sufficiently strange mark at the site (or thereabouts) will be seen in terms of alien activity. In this way we end up with a vast range of different traces, alsmot always truly explicable in conventional terms. But he will quickly dismiss all these possible explanations — for that is not what he seeks. Obviously there are some truly strange and apparently unidentifiable traces, but their percentage is faily low. In any case, a number of doubts must remain. Natural phenomena, or human activity under unusual circumstances, could precipitate apparently unexplained traces. If this circumstance is rare enough the possibility of identification is, to tell the truth, close to impossible, except in a few lucky cases. These possibilities are too important to overlook. The so . highly extolled \"physical evidence\" is based on a small number of baffling cases; and those which are investigated in enough depth form again but a fraction (perhaps 25%). Most \"incontestable proof actually stems from newspaper articles or nothing more substantial than the witness's say- so. In other words, what we term the \"trace phenomenon\" is but a small residue of well investigated reports; about 3.6% of the total volume of reports according to data passed to me by Ted Phillips (Phillips' TRACAT - an international catalogue of trace cases actually now having more than 2100 entries.). We must also not forget the outright hoax — fake traces accompanying fake UFO sightings. Such frauds may be perpetrated for many reasons; economical, psychological advertising, or merely as a joke. The number of trace cases determined to be fakes is actually quite remarkable, although not excessive (perhaps because of the inherent difficulty of proving a hoax). Some \"magical\" substance placed at the site coupled with a good recitation of a fabricated tale and the gullibility of both jounalists and ufologists can only produce one result..:.fake evidence presented as proof of an alien technology. Only the exceptionally skilled or rational investigator (often with the aid of lady luck) can rescue a situation at a later, date...but this certainly does not happen in many cases. I believe I have discovered two fundamental aspects of the physical trace question; giving us much cause to rethink our attitude towards it: 1) The explanation of mosf trace reports is to be found in terms of both natural and artifical origins. The range of these is so broad that their identification is often next to impossible. 2) It is impossible to accept some investigation reports as a basis for scientific data. Investigators too often are guilty of extreme subjectivity and emotional involvement. This make identification of traces very difficult. Not being at the site oneself one can only assign \"possible\" or \"probable\" identifications, which is to the detriment of serious research; even though UFO fanatics can easily turn it to their advantage by distorting the true situation. This means that practically all of the so-called trace data is useless in terms of scientific evaluation. We are left with a residue which seems to be small, but not negligible, and this seems to show the apparent physical reality of a seemingly unknown phenomenon (although unknown most certainly does not necessarily mean alien). But, even so, we must realize that the best of our investigation and research does not allow strict scientific determinations to be made. We can never totally exclude rare kinds of natural explanation. My future research will base itself upon this selected sample of high strangeness reports — .the apparently unknown residue. This is essential if one is to study the subject scientifically. The conclusion I must reach, then, is this. We cannot be certain that the UFO phenomenon has a physical basis. It is naturally difficult to accept this conclusion. But if we wish to develop a serious field of research, then we must learn to accept the destruction of deep- rooted dogmas and common illusions (or delusions). We need the courage to rethink our basics and understand what is wrong with them. Above all we must search for understanding and not cling to belief. RESEARCH FACILITY In an August 22nd press conference, Dr. J. Allen Hynek, Director of the Center for UFO Studies, announced the creation of a dramatic new UFO research facility to be based in Phoenix, Arizona. \"This is a world wide phenomenon that needs an international focus for serious scientific research and study,\" Hynek said. \"When the solution to the UFO puzzle comes,\" he added, \"I think it will prove not to be just a step in the march of science, but a mighty and unexpected quantum jump.\" This is indeed a startling and dramatic new development in the fledgling field of ufology. We look forward to hearing more about the Phoenix UFO Research Facility and to continued co-operation between MFUON and CUFOS in solving the UFO enigma. 7"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"LLANO LIGHT PUZZLE ByWALTANDRUS Melinda Cook called the Llano County Sheriffs office in Llano, Texas, .to inquire where she could report a UFO sighting. Upon checking, the dispatcher called her back and gave her the number of the National UFO Reporting Center in Seattle. Robert W. Gribble obtained the vital information from Melinda and forwarded it on to MUFON headquarters in Seguin for an interview and investigation. After arranging an appointment for interviews, Ray Stanford, John Palin and Walt Andrus, accompanied by Mitch Duncan and cameraman Wang from KHOU-TV in Houston, drove to Lone Grove. The small rural community, surrounded by farms and ranches with low rolling hills and clusters of wooded areas is about 13 miles west of Lake Buchanan. The four Cook daughters were playing in their yard after dusk. Bunnie .was chasing a toad when two of her older sisters started yelling \"look up in the sky.\" At first glance, Bunnie only saw a jet aircraft, but immediately noted the object that had caused her other three sisters to become excited. Having seen the object first, Posie thought it was a hang glider with a motor,on it, as it approached their yard and home. Posie's drawing at this angle shows a triangular group of lights with an extended tail. (The lights outlining the object were alternately red, green and blue as she depicted in her drawing made the following day.) She said it changed shape to a mere circular object as it got directly overhead. Marisa, the oldest, described the object in the following manner and also produced a colored drawing: the object had a dome, the bottom was flat, it had many red lights outlining the bottom and the red lights looked like they were going around in a circle while flashing on and off (pulsating). Neither Bunnie or Dbnnie, the youngest witness, 8 Date: April 19, 1984 Time: 8:05 p.m. CST Location: Lone Grove, Texas (8 miles east-northeast of Llano, Texas, on FM Road 2241) in Llano County. Witnesses: Mrs. Melinda Cook age 29 (mother) and her four daughters, Marisa age 10, Posie age 9, Bunnie age 8, and Donna age 7, all of Llano, Texas. provided drawings of the object that they concluded was a UFO. While being video - taped by KHOU-TV (Houston), Bunnie was asked specifically, what is a UFO? She promptly responded that it was. an unidentified flying object. Donna, who was dressed for the anticipated TV interview in a pink blouse and maroon jumper, was disappointed that her older sisters dominated the conversation during the filmed TV segment. Mitch Duncan, the KHOU-TV newsman, asked each of the girls if they were frightened or scared, during the encounter, to determine their candid responses. Excited was the key reaction, not fear. When the object descended and hovered directly over their five-room bungalow, Posie ran into the house to get her mother to come out and see the UFO. Melinda, who was in the kitchen baking a cake, had heard the girls yelling with excitement, but did not respond immediately due to preparations for the cake. When Melinda heard the loud noise over their home, she went outside to see what was creating all of the excitement and noise. By this time the object had moved northeastward and was hovering between their home and the next neighbor's house. Melinda heard the low frequency pulsating hum being emitted by the object before she had an opportunity to view it from the front of their house. She said it had a round domed shape on top and a flat to convex bottom. It had a horizontal row of red lights around the circumference that pulsated on and off. She stated that the sky was very bright, as were stars, so she had a clear view of the object's shape, both top and bottom, when queried about whether the numerous red lights were illuminating the object. She simulated the loud low frequency humming sound that pusled on and then off. in a very consistent pattern. As the object moved northeast over their neighrbor's house, she thought the frequency of the hum increased; however the loudness diminished with distance. Melinda felt that the object was l l / 2 to 2 times as large as their home. When she was given an object to hold at arms length to provide a measurement of the object's size, she said that it would take an object one foot long, which is incredible. (She admitted that she had difficulty estimating distance, which is not at all unusual.) As the object moved slowly northeastward toward some trees, Melina ran into the house and phoned her husband, Ned, at work, since he was very interested in UFOs. In addition to the pulsated humming sound from the UFO, a jet aircraft came from the southwest directly over their house, creating a tremendous amount of noise due to its low altitude. She said she has never heard a jet as loud except when at an airport. When she went back outside, the girls said the red lights on the UFO were now red, blue and green. They watched it make a left turn to the north, then another turn as it proceeded west. According to Melina, the \"jet\" swerved 1 in the same direction as the UFO during this manuever and then the two separated, the jet veering to the right and the UFO to the left. Melinda .(continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"LLANO, CONTINUED estimated that she observed the UFO for a total of two to three minutes, because of interruptions, whereas the girls viewed it for at least four minutes. One of their neighbors reportedly also saw the object. Within a few minutes after the departure of the UFO and the single jet aircraft, three more jets flying in formation approached from the southwest and took the same course as the UFO had transversed. Each jet had only one white light. She could not distinguish a red or green running light, that is customary on aircraft. *** During the interview, John Palin asked Melinda if their television set was turned on. She confirmed that it was, but since she was in the kitchen busily engrossed in making a cake, she could not see the picture. However, she noted noisy interference and asked her daughter Posie to turn it off when she came running into the house, \"because no one was watching it.\" She was unable to identify at what time the interference started. This may not be significant, since TV reception in their \"fringe area\" is quite frequently interrupted with electrical disturb- ances. When her husband, Ned, a mechanic, came home from work that evening he climbed up on the roof of their bungalow to scan the skies after seeing a white fireball pass over. While sitting on their roof at about 9 PM, Ned saw six consecutive flashes of white light that brightly illuminated the eastern horizon. Since it was a clear night without clouds, he did not believe that it was lightning. Two jet aircraft came in from the east-northeast and one from the southeast, converging in the area where he saw the bright white flashes. This event probably has no relevance whatsoever to the earlier UFO sighting, that evening; however, it does confirm continuous jet aircraft activity in the immediate area. A preliminary survey of the sources of jet aircraft in the Llano-Lone Grove locality disclosed the following: 1. Bergstrom A.F.B. at Austin, Boffom of craft as it first appeared. Draining by Posie Cook, age nine. Texas, is 68 airline miles southeast of Lone Grove. Some of the latest models of U.S.A.F. jet fighters are stationed at Bergstrom. 2. Randolph A.F.B., near San Antonio, is 90 miles south, but their advanced jet trainers usually fly during daylight hours. 3. Gray Field at Ft. Hood, Texas, is 50 miles northeast; however, they have a concentration of helicopters as a U.S. Army installation. 4. There is a U.S.A.F.B. at San Angelo, Texas, that is 117 miles to the west-northwest. It is not known what type and models of aircraft are stationed at this base. At the time of the interview, Melinda was very certain concerning the shape of the UFO; however, she did not venture a guess as to the color of the object. In a letter to this investigator dated July 3, 1984, she stated \"my daughters and I independently came to the conclusion that the body of the craft appeared to be a metalic silver/gray color.\" The individual drawings made by Marisa and Posie Cook are included with this report. I would like to take this opportunity to thank Bob Gribble for providing the lead for this sighting report. If he had not done such a thorough job of advising thousands of county sheriffs where to report UFO sightings, reports of this nature would never be known to UFO investigators."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"UFO REPORTS and DISSOCIATIVE HYSTERIA By MICHAEL D. SWORDS, Ph.D. Copyright fI984 by Michael D. Sii<oras This is the last of three articles on \"mass hysteria\" ana multiple-witness UFO sightings. Dissociative Hysteria Dissociative hysteria has several characteristics which make it an important psychiatric problem to investigate as an explanation for certain close encounters reports. A quote from a prominent text hints at this: \"In more serious forms, the external world becomes so strange that the patient feels himself in a dream world.\" 23 Amnesia, total or partial, is also an effect. Although expressing itself in a variety of forms, dissociative hysteria always seems to be an attempt to avoid conflict by mental escapism. \"D.H.\" is said to involve episodic disturbances in the stream of consciousness within which the behavior continues to be homogeneous; that is, even though the consciousness \"flips out\" into a fantasy or an escape of some kind, the person behaves in a congruent (orderly) way. DH is, therefore, not psychotic like schizophrenia, wherein serious and disjointed thought disorders are present. The more intense forms of DH have been known to degenerate into schizophrenia in time, however. Dissociative hysteria has been divided into three main categories: 1. \"Estrangement and depersonal- ization\" 2. \"Fantasy dream-like states\" 3. \"amnesia and fugue states,\" which may involve multiple personalities. 24 By far the commonest form involves \"estrangement\" (not feeling familiar with things, people, places which should be) and \"depersonali- zation\" (not feeling familiar with parts or the whole of ones own body). Although this is fascinating, it seems to have little application to UFO reports. The other two categories, though, seem potentially quite relevant. The second category, \"dream-like states,\" closely resembles somnambuli- stic (sleep-walking) states of childhood. The victim may flip into this \"trance,\" probably triggered by some stressful association, without warning. Their eyes are open, but they are obviously not in normal contact with their environment. They may utilize aspects of their environment which aid their fantasy, while ignoring those aspects which don't fit. They often have no memory of the fantasy following the \"trance\", but continue to have a feeling of unease. Sometimes they remember small bits of flashes of their \"experience.\" The fantasy scenes may be \"distant, strange, indistinct or foggy,\" or perhaps too distinct and too clear. There is \"unnaturalness\" about them. .Such states are considered to be fairly common among tense, worried children (\"twilight somnambulism states\"), which may point again to this \"chronic stress' syndrome among DH adults. 25 The sort of \"reveries\" that we've all entertained as children may also play a role. Some psychiatrists feel that the \"reveries\" form the raw materials for the DH twilight state fantasy escapes. 26 Unfortunately, DH fantasies tend to have a nightmarish quality about them which leave the victims troubles. Another important point: these fantasies may arise more readily out of \"hypnoid states,\" altered states of consciousness which occur in some monotonous environments. 27 One of such environments, driving on deserted highways, may be specially important as we all know. An amazingly high percentage of close encounter cases occur with observers in such lonely driving situations. 28 The third category, \"amnesia in fugue states,\" is not directly UFO- oriented except in what it says about the regularity of amnesia in DH ayndromes. \"Fugue\" is a sudden re- enactment of an experience of the past, often constituting .a release from current strains. Amnesia of these actions is fairly consistent. This is understandable since the re-enacted events usually contain strong negative emotions: pain, guilt, sense of loss. The importance of this syndrome to Ufology arises in that it has been often investigated by hypnosis. Fugue and Somnambulistic states are retrieved by hypnosis, and, in fact, some observers believe that these states and hypnosis are part of the same mental phenomenon (involving first lethargy, second catalepsy, and third somnambulism). 29 The power of suggestion is very strong in these states of consciousness, but some psychiatrists feel that there is little or no evidence that direct questioning \"leads\" or alters the person's story under hypnosis (in DH anyway). 30 They also feel that the hypnotist must establish good friendly rapport with the victim in order to bring out the full story, and that cool, \"scientific\" objectivity of the hypnotist is inappropriate in these cases. Well, it should be obvious why DH trance reveries with troubled feelings and whole or partial amnesia (retrievable as if a real experience by hypnosis) should concern us as ufologists. This syndrome relates not at all to cases where hallucination might apply (i.e. several \"witnesses\" of external events), but may relate to cases where \"delusions\" (internal fantasies felt to be real) could be present. Close encounter \"abductions\" with no external or independent corroberation are the key incidents to be checked. But how do we check? As (continued on next page) 10"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"HYSTERIA, CONTINUED a start let's describe the characteristics of this sort of hysterical personality. As with all the neuroses, the syndrome that we're discussing arises from increased internal and/or external stress. Here, anxiety reaches a point where it can no longer be tolerated. Then some spectacular \"compensa- tion,\" \"repression,\" or \"escape\" occurs. This stress is a personal problem of long-standing, not a unique event isolated from the person's past. It may well be triggered by added stress at home or at work, however. The specific trance fantasy might be unique, however, as this aspect of neurosis can vanish suddenly unlike the hallucinations or delusions associated with a psychosis such as schizophrenia. Victims of D.H. have other notable characteristics. They are typically people who have an excessive use of \"denial\" (they ostensibly deny their stresses and inadequacies). 31 Often they have low self-esteem under this denial, however. Their mood is described as \"depressive,\" although they are not considered victims of primary depression. 32 In fact; their minds seem to be in a constant state of distraction. 33 Once the hi-tech brain scanners become common, some probability exists that we will find a specific pattern of selective depression in brain structures operating behind the stresses, anxieties, lack of concentration on normal externals, and depressive mood. Some research suggests a control dysfunction in the right hemisphere of the brain. 34 Well, we probably can't test our UFO abductees by brain scans yet, but we could test for the past personal characteristics mentioned above, and use certain common test regimens to make the results more objective. Some evidence of pathological thinking in DH victims has been detected via Rdrschachs, for example. 3 * To their great credit, some ufologists have already begun this testing with abductees. Budd Hopkins and Aphrodite Clamar have used a battery of testing procedures, which include things like the Rorschach test and the MMPI. 36 These are very appropriate but one warning about another test: in a DH-case, passing a lie detector exam would in no way indicate that the individual was recounting an externally real experience. Dr. Clamar has written about her study: \"According to the test results, the ' two male subjects showed a sense ... of inadequacy, poor self image, and discomfort with their persona. My observation of the 12 other males I had hypnotized tended to confirm these test results. \" 3? Budd Hopkins, the well-known author of the study Missing Time.remarke 1983 Exploring Unexplained Phenomena Conference at the University of Nebraska: \"all these people t the abductees studied^ share a general uneasiness about the outside world.~:they are more 'wired', more nervous, and have less a sense of well-being...they are slightly wounded people.\" 38 These results are suggestive of a possible DH phenomenon. Further studies and good understanding of the \"abductees\" pre-abduction ; mental health and stressors are needed. That is, were they already \"wired,\" nervous, wounded people, or did the CEIII make them that way? This brings us to the \"status inconsistency\" theory of Donald Warren. 39 Some of these ideas have been mentioned earlier. Generally, the thought is that people who are \"mismatched\" as to education, ethnic background, and economics will experience some sort of chronic stresses because of these \"abnormal-, ities\" of status, arid, as a consequence, become involved in the \"mild mental pathology\" of .claiming to have UFO experiences. Warren claims to explain away a very large number of reports in this way. Although described in sociological terms, the emergence of UFO experiences from this incongruous sociology requires some psycho/ogica/ effect, and, as we have see, DH is the likely culprit. So, does Warren's theory make any sense? Does it get any support from studies? First, let's look at the original study by Warren himself. He took a Gallup Poll which contained information on who reported UFOs, and looked for \"inconsistent status.\" To. quote from Warren's summary: \"The analysis is completed. • Through a series of propositions and hypothesized links between the reporting of UFO sightings and :a particular kind of social position, the utility of social theory as a basis for explaining phenomena , presumed to be in the domain of the physical sciences has been demonstrated.\"' 10 Warren, and the editors of Science apparently, believed that he had proved his point. On closer examination of the article, however, a surprisingly different interpretation arises. To save time; here is a summary list of conclusions by this author from a re-inspection of the .article: 1. Looking at the total group of UFO reporters, absolutely no evidence of status inconsistency appeared; 2. Warren found a correlation only by eliminating large groups of reporters from his analysis. He eliminated all women and non- white males. Only with \"white males\" did a correlation arise. 3. The majority of the white males had high incomes, but they didn't show any status inconsistency correlation either, so they had to be eliminated 1 also. 4. His great \"correlation\" came in medium-income white males where a whopping \"20%\" of high inconsistency individuals macle UFO reports (vs. 5% of the general sample). Wow! Pretty impressive until you look at his sample size. It's 20% of 20 people: he's talking about four individuals! No serious statistician would waste 30 seconds on an analysis based on four people but the editors of Science published it! Pretty embarassing, but indicative of the prejudice against UFOs and the willingness to publish something which fits biases. 5. A second corelation graphed in the paper also depends upon only four people. This article is a classic of science and statistics at its deductive worst: sifting through (continued on next page) 11"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"HYSTERIA, CONTINUED mounds of variables until you finally find one which supports preconceived notions. Erich Von Daniken would be proud. It's of little surprise, then, that later attempts to validate this speculation have failed. Phillis Fox, in an article of UFO Phenomena and the Behavioral Scientist,* 1 which is a welcome bit of clarity by the way, outlines sociological possibilities for engendering UFO reports in the U.S. Dr. Fox commented, among other things, upon Warren's theory, and concluded that two subsequent studies had shown no support for the idea at all. Ronald Westrum, writing in the same collection, 42 also commented on Warren. Dr. Westrum, analyzing a subsequent Gallup Poll, also found no support for the status inconsistency hypothesis. Warren himself couldn't even make the data \"behave\" appropriately to the hypothesis in a second trial, coming up with contraditory conclusions five years later. As of now, this theory is a moribund issue. We need a very large sample size and an unbiased professional researcher (perhaps Dr. Fox or Dr. Westrum) to do the analysis. It looks today like \"mass DH\" based upon status inconsistency stresses does not explain the bulk phenomenon of UFO reporting. This \"status\" smokescreen demonstrates the damages possible by prejudiced researching and reporting, which occurs everywhere (and on both sides) in Ufology and the \"unpopular\" edges of science. Such bias is to thorough in certain experts that they probably don't even recognize it. An example of this occurred in the potentially important article by Grinspoon and Perskey in UFOs: a Scientific Debate.* 3 The two Harvard doctors displayed this antiscientific approach thusly: \"We are conjecturing that a population of emotionally disturbed people is more likely than a non-disturbed population both to be attracted to the possibility that we are being visited 12 by extraterrestrial forms of intelligent life and to make observations that support this possibility.\" and \"Because they are prone to distort reality, like the ambulatory schizophrenics, a population of borderline individuals could be expected to generate more UFO reports than a healthier population. \"** These two quotes betray the \"establishment\" closed-mindedness, which may prevent us from ever finding out what is behind, the UFO phenomenon. Because...the two quotes only make sense on the assumption that there are no external \"red\" UFOs. After all, if UFOs are externally real, then it would be the insane and mentally disturbed who would be more likely not to report them. Perhaps Drs. Grinspoon and Persky did not mean to be so blatantly biased in their comments. Perhaps they were instructed to take a very strong position for the conference from which the book arose. The title, UFOs: A Scientific Debate, might suggest this. But one last point: there's no room in Science for \"debate\" of this sort. Debate is an artificial confrontation of adversaries having closed positions. In that, Drs. Persky and Grinspoon have fit the picture of \"debate,\" while violating the spirit of science. Science is an open investigative process within which the promulgation of fixed positions has no place. SUMMARY 1. Mass Psychogenic Illness (\"mass hysteria\"), as currently understood, seems to bear little or no relationship to UFO phenomenon. 2. Dissociative Hysteria with dream-like states and whole or partial amesia is a potentially powerful alternative explanation for certain close encounter cases. 3. Mass \"status inconsistency\" stress appears to receive little or no support as a feasible explanation of bulk nationwide reporting of UFOs. 4. The scope of psychiatric research and writing on UFO phenomena is inadequate and often attitudinally inappropriate, yet more research is vital if we are to unravel the complexities of Ufology.

REPORT ROUNDUP UFO TRIANGLES By GARY LEVINE, Ph.D. MUFON State Director - New York One of the most perplexing aspects of the UFO phenomena is why UFOs are reported in such various shapes as discs, globes, squares, cigars and triangles. Reports of triangles or lights in triangular patterns occur occasionally and have been considered rare. Project Blue Book Special Report Number 14 listed 333 cases of UFOs from 1942 to 1963 and of these only two per cent were triangles. Other sources listing more current UFO sightings indicate they are few in number. Recently reports of triangles have been on the increase. On the night of August 1,1983, a triangle was reported from Walla Walla, Washington. On January 27 of this year at Valley Center, California, four lights in a V-shaped pattern were observed. These small lights \"increased in number to about a hundred in a few minutes.\" In New York State their appearance is being continually reported, particularly in the southern part of the state. In the fall of 1980 a black triangle which emitted a bluish-white light and projected a white spotlight was reported by two women near Middletown, New York. They reported the object as sixty feet long and having a humming noise. NEW YORK FLAP It was during the fall and summer of 1983 that a UFO flap occurred in New York's lower Hudson Valley. The center of attention was a flying boomerang that was spotted in Brewster, Ossining, Croton Falls, Yorktown and Mahopec, but as the summer months passed sightings of lights in triangular formation came in from Fishkill, Poughkeepsie, Hyde Park and Rhinebeck. A retired pilot and his wife viewed the object from a good vantage point. The pilot, well acquainted with aircraft, reported that, unlike aircraft lights 7-9 white lights were of great brilliance and did riot blink as do ordinary aircraft navigational lights. Accompanying the passage was the sound of a quiet humming noise most nearly akin to the noise of an operating electric motor... His wife reported that \"the object moved with the same slow majestic motion of a dirigible\" but, having observed such craft and their lighting pattern, she discounted the possibility of its being such an airship. She clearly remembers that the lighting changed from \"bright white to bright red simultaneously.\" On the night of June 21, 1984, in Hyde Park (a few miles north of Poughkeepsie), two observers reported a large V-shaped object with white lights and two green lights in its rear. It passed very slowly in front of a radio tower which is approximately 80 feet high. The observers, a quarter mile away, believe the object was,half way below the top of the tower or some forty feet above the ground. It made a humming noise. In seven selected cases the observers reported the object between 7:30 PM and 9:45 PM on clear evenings. A humming noise characteristic of an electric motor or transformer was heard in four of the seven cases. The object's speed was characterized by slow movement in all cases; one observer estimated this to be 20 to 25 miles per hour. UFO VS. IFO It is the lights, though, that lend support to the object's being a UFO rather than an IFO (aircraft, dirigible, balloon). The reporting of brilliant white lights which were either accompanied by green lights or changed to red lights were the most noticeable feature of the object. These white lights were, for the most part, fixed rather than moving sequentially. Also, the flight path of the UFO did not coincide with aircraft in the region. A precision flying team in small single-engine aircraft flying from a Dutchess County airport accounted for a number of sightings, and, as reported in a regional newspaper, the pilots \"usually stick to a well known path over the Taconic Parkway and have travelled as far south as Westchester County.\" Why triangles over the Hudson valley? No one knows for sure but the object or objects are observed near or over the Hudson River. Their deviation a few miles in either direction away from the river invites speculation. A bright spotlight emanating from the craft over the river has also been reported. Are there important military and research installations near the river? IBM has plants in Fishkill, Poughkeepsie and Kingston and the U.S. Military Academy at West Point has a small airbase. At Indian Point is a nuclear power station which has been a subject of controversy. As of this writing the sightings have been reported through June. Are other areas of the country experiencing similar UFOs? Hopefully more information will be obtained, maybe even video, still or motion pictures. SUPPORT UFO RESEARCH 13"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"QUAKE LIGHT? By JANET BORD . Mid-Wales Earthquake On Sunday, 15 April, 1984, at 10:06 p.m., an earthquake measuring3.3 omn the Richter scale was felt over 400 square miles of Powys, its epicenter being near Felindre, 7 miles SE of Newton. Explosions were also heard, for example, at Abermule, Newton, Kerry and Knighton. Although we live at Montgomery, 10 miles from Felindre, we were on a return journey from the Midlands at the time of the earthquake and so did not experience it. however, a few minutes before arriving home (and of course before we knew there had been an earthquake) I witnessed an inexplicable light in the sky. Colin was driving, and, as often on a clear night when I am a passenger in a car, I was observing the moon and stars. The moon was full, and the sky clear, except for a few wisps of cloud moving quickly. I noticed what looked like a star, of average brightness, a little below and to the left of the moon, and was watching it to ascertain that it retained the same relative position in relation to the moon. STAR? But after a few seconds I realized that it was moving, and it soon reached a point immediately below the moon, whereupon it was obscured by a small patch of clous which had come from the right. I kept my eyes on the cloud, in order to see the \"star\" re-emerge and to watch its progress across the sky. But although the cloud continued to move to the left, no 'star' was to be seen, and that area of the sky was completely clear. Nor could I see the 'star' heading off in any other direction. This whole incident was over in one minute and took place near Churchstoke, 9 miles NE of Felindre, and at around 12:10 a.m., two hours after the earthquake. SINGLE WITNESS There is no other witness to this sighting. I did not draw Colin's attention to it because by the time I realized that the light was inexplicable, it had disappeared. The moon was then behind us (we had changed direction: it was throughout the sighting on our left) and difficult for a car driver to observe, and we were closely following a mini- coach along a narrow road. I should add that although I was definitely awake at the time, I had awoken from a short nap only half a mile before the sighting began. (Signed Janet Bord, 18 April, 1984. UFO THE SIZE OF A 747 By LELAND BECHTEL MUFON State Director, Maine On Sunday, July 15, 1984, 9:05 p.m., Robert White and his friend, Carol Cloukey, left her home on Detroit Avenue in rural Detroit, Maine, to go to Pittsfield for dinner. After traveling about one mile in her Subaru, which she was driving, they rounded a bend in the road where Carol was first to see a bright yellowish-orange light (estimated to be about twice the brightness of the North star) directly above the road ahead of them. The sky was overcast with a ceiling of about 3000 feet. No other stars were visible. Suddenly the light made a perfectly vertical drop in mid-air. She speeded up the car to about 60 m.p.h. in an effort to get beyond it. Robert told her to slow down, then to go a little more. Now the light dropped again, so it appeared about dead-center in the car windshield. Thereupon, she stopped, 14 slammed the car into reverse gear, and started to back up. What at first they thought was a star now appeared to Carol to be a crashing plane coming toward them, but to Robert it appeared to be traveling at a speed too slow to be a plane. After backing up about 50 feet, they observed that the object was alongside of them on the left side of the car and about 150 feet oft the ground. The glow of the object had subsided, and in the evening light it appeared grayish in color, with 4 red lights, 1 or 2 brighter white lights, and of an immense size estimated to be larger than a 747 plane. It passed the left side of the car moving behind them. Carol looked back, saying it was just a plane, but Robert was skeptical due to the fact that there was no noise. He opened his car door and looked back to see it make a 180 degree turn, creeping up behind them. He told her to back into the driveway of a farm house on their right (owned by theCianchette family and the only house in the immediate vicinity). The object was now almost directly above them, slightly to the left side of the car at an altitude of approximatley 100 feet (estimated at about 40 feet above 60 foot high trees between the house and the road). Robert observed that when they stopped, the object stopped! when they moved, it moved. Robert felt that it did not want them to go by. TRIANGLE LIGHTS He observed the rear of the object as 3-sided, with the front coming to a triangular point. There was a red light at each corner, and somewhere else there were 1 or 2 very bright white lights. There was a dome underneath, but the formation of the top could not be observed. Carol got out her side of the car and hurried on to the main road. Robert stood by his side of the car looking up over the car. As he turned toward the house, the object turned with him, starting and stopping as he started and stopped. He said that at this point he felt that he was being \"contained\" and was very frightened. He said he felt the object appeared just as curious as they were and very cautious. He noted that the leaves of the trees under the object (continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"747, CONTINUED did not move. He said that at no time did he take his eyes off the ofject as he began to move up the driveway toward the house. VANISHES At this point, Carol called that a car was coming down the road, traveling toward them in an easterly direction. She called to Robert, asking if she should stop the car, but he advised her not to do so. The object now began to move away slightly, traveling in a northeasterly direction for a distance of about 100 to 200 feet and suddenly \"vanished,\" not in the distance, but suddenly, before his very eyes. He later expressed wonderment that such a large object could suddenly disappear in such an inexplicable manner. Carol quickly returned to Robert and her car (He estimated that they observed the object for a total of 2 minutes). They talked excitedly for 5-10 minutes before getting into their car and continuing on to Pittsfield where they went immediately to Robert's home and related the experience to his father and mother (arriving there about 9:30 p.m. after a 5 minute drive). After hearing the account, Robert's father phoned the Control Time Sequence 9:05 p.m. Departed from Carol's house 05 Min. Drove to point of sighting 02 Min. Witnessed object 10 Min. Talked 05 Min. Drove to Pittsfield 9:27 p.m. Arrived at Robert's house Tower at Bahgor Airport, asked about planes in the area and was informed that at about that time two 747 planes were in the area traveling at 6000 feet. Neither Robert nor Carol observed or heard' these planes. The person in the Control Tower gave Mr.. White the phone number of the National UFO Reporting Center in Seattle, Washington. He then called and reported the sighting. RESPONSIBLE WITNESS Robert is 20 years old and a sophomore at the University of Maine at Orone where he is a physical education major. He does not drink or use drugs. To this investigator he appears reliable, honest, responsible, and intelligent. His parents, likewise, appear to be very responsible, rational, sensitive, and appealing people. Based on perceived personal qualities and the internal consistency of the report, this investigator has complete confidence in the veracity and accuracy of the reporting witness. NO HARM One week before this event Robert's 11-year, old brother came in from their backyard in Pittsfield saying that he saw a bright light moving in the sky. When others refused to take him seriously, he cried for a period of two days. Subsequently, his parents and the others reassured him of their trust in him and their belief that nothing would harm him. The father also reported seeing a light move rapidly across the sky when he was outside in their yard at an earlier date. COMMOTION The day following the sighting by Robert and Carol, Robert's mother phoned the Cianchette family (residents of the farm house at the place of the sighting), .informing them of the event. They said that they were alarmed at the commotion outside their house with \"people running up and down their driveway.\" They said they had looked out but did not look up and consequently saw no object in the sky. RE-ENTRY/UFOS By DAN WRIGHT, State Director, Michigan and HARRIET BEECH, State Section Director As a matter of record, at 9:55 PM, Sunday, May 20, 1984, debris from a Soviet launch vehicle, Soyuz T-10, reentered Earth's atmosphere. Blazing a path across Texas to the northeast, it immediately lit up switchboards across mid-America on this unusually clear night. Most callers described a diffused cloud of sparks and vapor trails behind a huge fireball. Some who observed the display from Michigan locales emphasized the numerous fragments accompanying the main body.\" These, they reasoned, must have been a formation of sorts, small crafts ejected from a \"mother ship.\" A June 27 response generated by the Space Surveillance Center, North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD), resolved the matter. The spacecraft had taken cosmonauts to the Salyut-7 space station, then was de-orbited on April 11. SILENT SIGHTING Butch Fuller and Bob Fowler were out testing the Fuller family's new car, driving along the countryside in southern Ingham County near Eaton Rapids, a rolling area dotted with farms and woodlots. , About 10 PM, as the two were starting for home, they noticed two bright lights descending rapidly and approaching them from the west. Assuming them to be airplane headlights, they wondered aloud as to whether the aircraft was in trouble since there is no airport in the vicinity. The object swooped down at great speed, then came nearly to a halt a few hundred feet over the road and two hundred yards or so in front of the men. As the giant vehicle glided over the roadway, Butch turned down the radio, rolled down his window and put his head out, but he heard nothing. They later described the craft as likened to a triangle, with a wingspan of football-field proportions and about four times the width of their two-lane road from its nose to the rear. The (continued on next page) 15"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"UFOS, CONTINUED edges of the vehicle were rounded. Its finish was a \"battleship grey\" that reflected the lights somewhat. Bob urged Butch to \"step on it!\" As they raced toward the scene, though, the lights seemed to fade out. This, they agreed, may have been because the lights were pointing forward and so, being recessed, appeared to be extinguished when the object had crossed their path. They believed it should still have been visible against the sky as a dark mass, but it was not to be resighted despite a brief search of the area. Later, on the eleven o'clock news, they heard mention of reported sightings of a high-flying vehicle with a sparkler effect (i.e., the spacecraft debris). What they observed, the men are convinced, was not at all associated with a reentry. BEAUTY & BEAST Shirley Sturgis and Melody Hoerl had spent their Sunday shopping and attending a movie in Kalamazoo. It was not a few minutes past 10 PM as they turned south onto Constantine Road, a few miles from Three Rivers near the Indiana border. Not yet up to highway speed, the trees on their left cleared away for a railroad crossing. At that moment, they wintessed what they instantly discerned to be an aerial phenomenon. Hovering just over a tangle of scrub trees was an elongated object, tapered at either end and shrouded in a silvery white mist. Behind the nearly opaque camouflage, a line of steady green and rose-colored lights shone along the base. The extreme upper portion was somewhat more clearly visible, a tapering silver outline. The cloudlike covering, encompassed the entire length of the object and beyond, some forty yards or more, and seemed to prevent the surface lights from casting onto the trees immediately below. Shirley slammed on the brakes at first glance of the strange vehicle. She rolled down her window but heard nothing, leaving the engine running and headlights on (with no effect to either). She was elated to witness \"one of the most beautiful things I've ever seen.\" Melody, by contrast, was greatly agitated. For the next few minutes, while they gawked at the spectacle only thirty yards away, she argued vehemently that they must leave: \"It was coming down very, very slowly, almost like a slow-motion sidew'ays movement And I just felt like we had a choice. We could stay and hope that it wouldn't stall the Bronco out, or we could get out of there. And Shirley was all enthused and ready to get out .and meet this thing, and .I kept saying, 'I want to leave; I'm scared. I really want to go.'\" Having been exposed to media accounts of E-M effects, physcial abductions and consequent traumas, Melody wanted no part of what .might be in the offing. SOLVED? Shirley reluctantly started to move the truck forward, then halted again almost immediately as they reached the crossing stop sign. They were a scant sixty feet from the craft as it continued to \"creep\" toward .them, protruding now from the line of trees. Nearly hysterical, Melody screamed at Shirley to leave. Though fascinated by the sight, for the sake of her friend Shirley crossed over the tracks and continued down the road for perhaps half a mile. While the seconds passed, she noted a more conciliatory tone in Melody's., reactions and so suddenly turned the truck around, racing back to the scene. But the object was nowhere to be found. When they arrived at Shirley's home, they were made aware of the sighting by Shirley's son and daughter in-law, who were among the many that had mistaken the reentry as anomalous. LETTERS DEAR EDITOR, In response to the letter from Joe Kirk Thomas (May-June, 1984) on cooperation with the National Enquirer, I cannot agree with his concept that only intellectuals are worthwhile subscribers. Those \"middle-aged or older housewives of fairly low educational background\" are the same people who write letters to their local and national Senate and House members. They could be a distinct advantage in such matters as the investigation of the coverup of UFO information by the government agencies involved and would certainly provide the Journal with an increased \"clout.\" No other single item breeds 16 All letters to the Journal intended for publication, incidentally, must be neatly typed and double-spaced! This applies equally, if not more so, to articles and other editorial submissions. Please anticipate our problems! Otherwise, we welcome all letters of comment and criticism, as well as manuscripts of all persuasion. respect for a publication more rapidly than a large and growing circulation and I am sure the Directors are on the right track with their decision on this matter. Mr. Thomas takes MUFON to task for not pursuing contacts with \"literary, picture and quasi-technical magazines.\" Be advised, Mr. Thomas, that all of these publications put together would be a drop in the bucket compared to the exposure provided in the Enquirer, and believe me, those housewives are definitely not, repeat note, the wrong target. CLIFF HENDERSON Sunnyvale, CA DEAR EDITOR, I have just finished reading the July-August issue of the MUFON JOURNAL and was extremely interested in the propulsion-related article by Ann Druffel. This article was stimulating to the point that I immediately searched through all the written materials that I have stashed away, in hopes that I would find other articles that related to the mercury propulsion possibility. Unfortunately, I was unable to locate any such (continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"LETTERS, CONTINUED materials. I did though, find an article on a metal, nitinol, which is a nickel and titanium alloy. Nitinol was apparently discovered by accident in 1958 at the U.S. Naval Ordinance Laboratory. This alloy has been utilized in at least 2 engines and runs on warm and cool water. I have never heard this metal alloy mentioned in the field of UFOlogy, and am very curious to hear if any fellow MUFON members have delved into any experimentation or collected any documentation on this metal. For those at the Journal who are not familiar with this metal, perhaps I can explain some properties. Nitinol in short, has a shape memory response. That is, when'the alloy is cool, the alloy can be bent repeatedly without any metal fatigue. When warmed, the alloy springs back to its original shape with a force of up to 55 tons per square inch. The alloy seems to derive its power, at least as described here, from immersion in warm and cool water with a temperature variance of 3 to 4 degrees centigrade. I have read several times in the past that UFOs have been seen over water, under water, or at times, seen taking on water. Perhaps UFOlogists could take a closer look at this metal alloy as it may relate to our field. I also understand that the Chinese are experimenting heavily with nitinol, and that the U.S. Military is sponsoring research which for now remains classified. I would be happy to send the materials on nitinol to anyone who writes and asks for them. Explain this one.. .A nitinol engine was left running continously, then checked for signs of fatigue. The engine was found to be constantly speeding up. The engine's designer explained that the nitinol seemed to be learning... to resume its original forged shape. Hope to stimulate thoughts, DR. MICHAEL D. HART Editor, In an article entitled \"Experi- menters' Response: Imaginary Abductions\" by Alvin H. Lawson and Dr. W.C. McCall (MUFON Journal, March 1983), this author was severely criticized, ridiculed and accused of falsely representing my involvment with some joint hypnosis experiments. Basically our disagreement focuses on the following items: a. How our hypnosis experiments got started. b. Who was involved in the actual study. c. Are there similarities between hypnosis and REM sleep. I: responded too quickly to the accusations of fraud from my former colleagues — before obtaining the supporting documents from my files. Now I am enclosing these documents and hope to prove that I was 100 percent honest in everything reported in my, article entitled \"Resolving the Issue of Hypnosis\" (MUFON UFO Journal, September 1982). How Did the Hypnosis Experiments Really Get Started? In my article (Resolving the Issue of Hypnosis) I told how I had been asking Ms. Pat Colliris, a well known stage hypnotist, to help me study the creative abilities of a person under hypnosis. Because of a busy schedule, she was unable to but suggested two other prominent hypnotists for this study. By the time I received her letter, though, I had already made the same suggestion to Dr. McCall and he talked Professor Lawson into joining in the experiments. I would have preferred to work with Ms. Collins because stage hypnotists are thoroughly knowledgeable in the use of creative hypnosis — medical hypnotists are not and do not realize the amazing creative ability a person can have. My proof of what I say about the hypnosis experiments origin is in the letter Ms. Collins sent me, Item A, and she could verify this also. In addition, I have a personal letter from Professor Lawson, Item B, where he acknowledges how the experiments started and praised me for the idea. Apparently he forgot that he had written that letter and later decided to change his story. Dr. McCall said: \"As to who originated the imaginary study, 1 have always felt that I first propounded the idea.\" The discrepancy could easily be solved if the three of us submit to a polygraph examination on the entire matter involving the hypnosis experiments. We could then see who is really trying to mislead the readers of the MUFON UFO Journal. It would be interesting and significant if Lawson and McCall refused to take a polygraph examination. Who Was Involved in the Hypnosis Study? \"Mr. DeHerrera's participation in the entire study was marginal, and while he attended most of the sessions, he was hot present for all of them,\" said Dr. McCall. What Dr. McCall doesn't know is that after we completed the original experiments and saw some significance in the results, Lawson decided to continue the study without me. I was not notified of continuing experiments. \"...he provided little toward the performance of the study, and nothing to the clarification of the puzzling patterns and other data,\" said Professor Lawson. What I actually did was make the suggestion for the study, contribute to the planning of the study, recruit two of the six volunteers, and document 'my interpretations of the study:results in an unpublished paper sent to Coral and Jim Lorenzen. \"Mr. DeHerrera claims to have studied hypnosis at great length, yet his statement that the brain waves of a hypnotized person are identical with those produced during REM sleep is simply not true,\" said Dr. McCall. Where is Dr. McCall's proof? Why did he misquote me so outrageously? Are we to believe everything Dr. McCall tells us simply because he is a physician? I am employed by a company that makes some of the most sophisticated instruments for measuring brain waves and other physiological parameters. But I do not claim to be an expert in the area of brain wave interpretations. I can operate the equipment and take the measurements. As a technical writer at this company, I glean all information from the reference documents and specialists before writing anything on the subject. And this is what I did before doing the article published in the MUFON UFO Journal. My statements on hypnosis and brain waves are identical to those in a (continued on next page) 17"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"LETTERS, CONTINUED reference handbook on EEGs, Clinical Electroencephalography, Item C: My Statements: \"What is the nature of hypnosis?...there are no known physiological correlates common only to hypnosis. Hypnosis has no unusual effects on the EEC rhythms. As a person is hypnotized, alpha (slow) brain waves appear just as in sleep. Then if a visual-producing stimulus is suggested to the subject, alpha is blocked and desynchronized beta (fast) rhythms appear. While visualizing, his eyes will dart back and forth just as in REM sleep. Dreaming occurs during REM sleep. Could hypnosis be REM sleep?\" EEC Handbook: \"Hypnosis has no effect in itself on the EEC rhythms. If a tense, anxious patient is hypnotized a good alpha rhythm may appear as the patient relaxes and if physiological sleep is induced by suggestion, a normal sleep pattern will develop. Blocking of the alpha may occur if a visual stimulus is suggested to the subject.\" Observations and Conclusions It does not take someone skilled in rhetoric to recognize that the arguments from Professor Lawson and Dr. McCall are pure emotional diatribe. They reacted irrationally to something perceived — but not present — in my article \"Resolving the Issue of Hypnosis.\" Lacking any proof to support their charges, they relied on tactics of illogical persuasion,., rather than rational and logical responses to the information in my article. The hysterical reactions reveal a basic dishonesty and a deeply disturbed personality on the part of Professor Lawson. Dr. McCall was simply duped into believing I was unjustly persecuting his friend Lawson. Obviously their intent was to demolish my reputation and stop me from ever publishing anything again. It is regretable that Dr. McCall was so easily swayed into believing I was such a villain — and that Richard Hair (editor of the Journal) was convinced that he should publish their articles without consulting me first. I will try to answer any questions forwarded to me on the issue of hypnosis experiments with Lawson and McCall. It is my sincere hope that this open letter and supporting documents will show that I am a responsible investigator of UFO. phenomenon — and lay-to-rest all charges of fraud from two irresponsible professional people.

Allen Hynek concerning examples of unexplained UFO sightings and governmental coverups of information pertaining to the subject. NATIONAL ENQUIRER reporter Henry Gris claims that two Soviet cosmonauts were joined in orbit by three extraterrestrials who attempted to communicate with them. This allegedly occurred during May 1981, while the cosmonauts were aboard Salyut 6. Gris' report appears in the August 7 issue of the ENQUIRER. Reports of UFOs sucking up water from swimming pools are featured in the ENQUIRER'S August 21 issue. This allegedly occurred in January at the town of Olavarria, Argentina. Henry Gris contributes a report on the new Soviet special commission which has been set up to study the UFO subject. The investigation was launched after numerous sightings in the Soviet Union. It will be headed by former cosmonaut Pavel Popovich, veteran of two space flights, according to Gris' article in the ENQUIRER'S September 4 issue. The latest in a continuing series of UFO articles by Bruce Maccabee appears in the September issue of FATE. This installment discusses sightings of disc-shaped objects at Muroc Air Force Base (now Edwards AFB) in California during July 1947. The long-awaited book by Lawrence Fawcett & Barry J. Greenwood, CLEAR INTENT, is now available. As the first volume to deal specifically with government involvement with the UFO subject, it delivers the goods in the form of reprinted documents from various government agencies which the authors obtained through the Freedom of Information Act. Four chapters of the book are devoted to recounting the CIA and FBI interest in UFOs for the period of 1947-1977. There is detailed information on UFO \"intrusions\" at various Air Force bases in 1975, as well as reports of similar incidents in other years. Cattle mutilations and mystery helicopters are also covered, with a chapter being devoted to the latter topic. Even for those who have kept up with the release of these government documents through the years, it is good to have all the information in one volume, along with the authors' commentaries. In a closing chapter, Fawcett & Greenwood present 12 conclusions they have reached as a result of their studies. UFO NEWSCLIPPING SERVICE The UFO NEWSCLIPPING SERVICE will keep you informed of all the latest United States and World-Wide UFO activity, as it happens! Our service was started in 1969, at which time we contracted with a .reputable international newspaper-clipping bureau to obtain for us, those hard to find UFO reports (i.e., little known photographic cases, close encounter and landing reports, occupant cases) and all other UFO reports, many of which are carried only in small town or foreign newspapers. \"Our UFO Newsclipping Service issues are 20-page monthly reports, reproduced by photo-offset, containing the latest United States and Canadian UFO newsclippings, with our foreign section carrying the latest British, Australian, New Zealand and other foreign press reports. Also included is a 3-5 page section oi \"Fortean\". clippings (i.e. Bigfoot and other \"monster\" reports).

To the veteran researcher, this may seem a bit academic, but we need to be constantly reminded of basic concepts in these investigations. I would certainly recommend CLEAR INENT to anyone interested in the UFO subject and especially to those who may think there is nothing to it all \"or the government would have told us.\" The publisher is Prentice-Hall, Inc.

Stacy has assumed the editorship of the MUFON UFO Journal effective with the October 1984 issue, replacing Rovert V. \"Bob\" Pratt. Walt Andrus will be the new Assistant or Associate Editor. The vacancy on the MUFON Borad of Directors, that of Director of Publications created when Mr. Stacy became the Editor, is being filled by Richard H. Hall. (See article in this issue for details.) Dick Hall's major contribution will involve the annual MUFON UFO Symposium Proceedings as Co-Editor and editing monographs published by MUFON. Donald M. Ware, presently a State Section Director in northwest Florida, has additionally agreed to be the Assistant State Director for Florida so as to give greater operational support to Norman S. Bean, the State Director. The first test of the MUFON TELUFONET was conducted on Saturday, August 4th, starting at 11:00 a.m. CDST, to determine the effectiveness of the nationwide telephone network to comunicate vital information to all State Directors. Obviously, no one was given any prior notice of the test. Nearly 50% of the State Directors were not available to respond immediately to the telephone calls made in a planned sequence. If the next assigned State Director did not respond imediately to their telephone call, the caller selected the next State Director on the TELUFONET list until he/she obtained a reply and relayed the prepared message from the International Director in Seguin, Texas. Due to the vacation period, telephone answering services and personal business, weaknesses in the telephone net were readily apparent. As each State Director selects an Asistant State Director, these people will become alternates and thus improve this communication medium. Marge Christensen and her committee are to be commended for organizing the TELUFONET. *** Tom Deuley and the MUFON of San Antonio Host Committee for the MUFON 1984 UFO Symposium held on July 6, 7, and 8 at the Holiday Inn - Airport recently submitted their financial report. Even though the attendance did not approach the 1400 people at San Francisco in 1979, the profit margin exceeded the total of all fourteen previous symposia combined. This may be attributed to wise management and the very cooperative contract megotiated with the Holiday Inn. MUFON of San Antonio had the unique and distinct pleasure of making gifts and donations to qualified tax- exempt UFO organizations with their profits. The Mutual UFO Network, Inc. is taking this opportunity to thank the host organization for their generous gift to the work of MUFON. With only six months of advance notice and preparation time, MUFON of San Antonio not only produced one of the finest and most enjoyable symposium programs, but proved that with astute management, it can be a financial success. They have thus challenged all future host committees to repeat their performance. The MUFON 1985 UFO Symposium will be held Friday, June 28 through Sunday, June 30, 1985, at the Chase Hotel in St. Louis, Missouri, hosted by the UFO Study Group of Greater St. Louis. The theme for the 1985 symposium is \"UFOs: The Burden of Proof. According to Black's Law Reference, the \"burden of proof is the obligation of a party to establish by evidence a requisite degree of belief concerning a fact in the mind of the trier of the fact or the court\". It is the belief that UFO researchers today have substantial evidence to support the reality of the UFO and related phenomena. Each speaker is being asked to present the evidence which they have collected over the years in their particular area of expertise, as though they were in a court of law. The attendees will be the jury -- the burden of proof will rest with you. Cliff Palmberg is the host chairman and Ken and Helen Hanke are the assistant chairpersons. Their invitation to everyone is taken from the song \"Meet Me in St. Louis.\" *** The success of the UFO Forum held in Beverly, Massachusetts on Sunday, August 12th exceeded all expectations, playing to a standing room audience. Walter Webb has prepared an article with photographs of the speakers for a future issue of the Journal. On Sunday, August 19th, MUFON of Michigan held their quartely meeting and annual picnic at Francis Park in Lansing, Michigan. On the same date, the UFO Study Group of Greater St. Louis held their sixteenth annual picnic at Love Park in St. Louis County. The speakers were Mrs. Rosetta Holmes and John Schroeder, who are state Section Directors in Illinois and Missouri, respectively. The public demand for the new book Clear Intent, coauthored by Lawrence Fawcett and Barry J. Greenwood, has caused Prentice-Hall to go immediately into a second printing, since there was an instant sell- out in the nation's book stores. MUFON obtained 100 copies of the paperback edition, which are available for $8.95 plus $1.50 for postage and handling. Clear Intent is one of the most significant and important UFO books published in the last decade. MUFON will maintain a continuous stock of Clear Intent for our publication list.
