UFOs and cemeteries By Preston Dennett raveyards and cemeteries are places usually ssociated with ghosts. However, several cases I are now on record in which UFOs have shown an undue interest in graveyards. The question is, why? What interest could UFOs possibly have in something so macabre as a cemetery? These types of cases are somewhat rare, but they con- tinue to turn up, and have been confounding leading UFO investigators for years. These are not cases of so-called \"spook- lights,\" but accounts of apparent metallic spacecraft. Let us ex- amine a few cases and see for ourselves. Case One: Mount Pleasant Cemetery On the evening of May 7,1967, fourteen-year-old Ricky Banyard was walking to his home in Pr ,eston Dennett Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, when he observed a \"strange beam of light\" emitted from an unknown object in the sky. He quickly ran to the home of his friend, Glenn Coate, and the two boys watched the object through binoculars. They said it \"looked like two bowls joined together at the rims, and it hovered, making a whistling noise.\" It would periodically send powerful beams of light to the ground. At around 2 A.M. Glenn became tired and went to bed while Ricky went outside and hid under some trees to watch the object. The next time the object emitted a beam of light, he followed it to the ground and was shocked to realize that it was shining directly on the Mount Pleas- ant Cemetery across the street from his home. Accord- ing to the report on the case, \"The light beam extended down, striking the ground and making a white, bright, rect- angular area on the ground.\" Ricky eventually tried to get closer. However, as soon as he stepped out from under the trees the beam of light retracted, the lights on the object went out, and the object departed with a \"noise like a jet starting up,\" followed by several \"bangs.\" The most interesting aspect of this case was revealed by an inspection of the cemetery the next day. As the report reads, \"...an inspection of the cemetery yielded several unexplainable rectangular black streaks on the sand and gravel paths leading among the graves. Rocks and pebbles seemed to be charred, but none of the grassy areas or trees appeared to have been harmed. \"Joseph LaForge, the cemetery foreman, could not ex- plain the marks, but suggested that a grader had gone over the roads on Saturday and may have exposed some of the cinder base under the gravel. He then pointed to About the author Preston Dennett, a MUFON Field Investigator, is the author of Extraterretrial Visitations (2001), UFOs Over Topanga (1999), One in Forty (1996), and UFO Healings (1996), as well as eighty articles. two other large marks and said, 'I don't know about them -they look pretty unusual.' He couldn't account for the black marks on the stones, and explained that no oil is used on the cemetery roads.\" Case Two: An Arkansas funeral home Another even stranger case occurred earlier that year, but more than a thousand miles away. The witness is the anonymous owner of a funeral home. The whole ordeal began when the owner's son ran inside and reported that a \"flying saucer\" was hovering right over the funeral par- lor. The owner reports that she assumed her son was imagining things, and didn't investigate. Then, several days later, a man was visiting the grave of a dead friend when he ran inside and told the owner of the funeral parlor that a \"disk-shaped, metallic appearing object\" was hovering directly over the building. Suddenly remembering her son's earlier report, she ran outside to see, but by then the object was gone. However, she was left thoroughly shaken by the event, and eventually made an official report to the Aerial Phe- nomenon Research Organization (APRO) headed by Jim and Coral Lorenzen. She agreed to report her case only on the conditions that her name and location be kept con- fidential. Case Three: Leominster Cemetery A truly alarming case which occurred in Leominster, MA, was originally investigated by J. Allen Hynek. It began on March 8,1967, when a young couple (a painter and hairdresser) went out for a drive to look at \"the snowladen branches of trees after a heavy snowstorm.\" It was around 1 A.M. on a clear night, and they were passing a small cemetery outside of Leominster. Both noticed that the cemetery was strangely shrouded in fog, even though it was clear everywhere else. Then they spotted a strange light directly over the cemetery, and their initial reaction was that there must be a fire in the cemetery, and the fog was actually smoke. They took a closer look, and at this point things went from strange to bizarre. As the investigator's report says: \"He turned the car around again and put his windows down and drove off the road broadside to the cemetery and to the light...he got out of the car, shut the door and started to point to the object. Simultaneously several events occurred: the au- June 2002 MUFON UFO Journal Page 3"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"tomobile lights, radio, and engine ceased functioning; he felt an elec- trical shock, and his body became numb and immobilized; the arm he was pointing with was pulled against the roof of the car and hit with such a force that it left an imprint in the ice and snow...Mr. W. could not move a muscle, al- though he could hear, and his mind seemed to be functioning normally. Then the lights and radio came back on, and the object which had been rocking back and forth emit- ted a humming sound and accel- erated upward and out of sight above the fog patch.\" The two witnesses were left thoroughly frightened by the event. As one said, \"Nothing I have ever seen compares with the object.\" Case Four: Haverhill Cemetery With nearly a dozen books and hundreds of cases to his credit, Raymond Fowler remains one of the most respected UFO researchers. So it should come as no surprise that he has also noticed a connection between UFOs and grave- yards. According to Fowler, approximately 23% of his cases took place over rural fields, a portion of which were actually cemeteries. Says Fowler, \"I had no idea then that cemeteries...would figure in future UFO investigations.\" In the A.M. hours of Oct. 6, 1964, Robert Soucy and his friend William Chase drove through the country out- side of Haverhill, MA. Chase spotted the object first-a metallic domed disk-hovering above the trees next to a graveyard. Soucey put the car in reverse and backed up until they could see the object closely. At this point, the object was only 150 feet away. According to Soucey, \"It looked like a half ball on a flat plate. We both stared at it for about twenty seconds and then got out of there real fast. No one else was around and we were plenty scared.\" In fact, the two men were so upset by what they saw that they drove straight to the police station. Seeing that the two men were sincerely frightened, the police sent a car to the scene of the sighting. But by then, the object was gone. Case Five: Pournoy-la-Chetive Cemetery On Oct. 9, 1954, four children ranging in age from five years old to sixteen, were roller-skating by the cemetery near their homes in Pournoy-la-Chetive in France when they encountered a UFO. It hovered directly over the graveyard and was described as round, luminous, and about three meters in diameter. All four witnesses watched in shock as a short figure appeared. It was dressed in black, had large eyes, and hair on its face. It shone a \"blinding light\" at them, and spoke in an \"unknown language.\" The four young wit- nesses fled in terror, but turned around in time to see the object take off and fly away. Case Six: Nova Scotia Cemetery . One alarming case was investigated by Eugene H. Prison, the MUFON Provincial Director for Nova Scotia, Canada. In this case, a paperboy had taken a shortcut through a local cemetery to deliver papers. Once inside the cemetery grounds, he noticed an increase in wind and a strange whining sound, followed by a sudden rush of heat. On his right, 3 feet away, he observed a triangu- lar-shaped object about 9 feet tall and 5 feet wide hover and move quickly by him and out of view. Apparently, he had surprised the UFO after it had landed in the cemetery. The witness did not observe anything else unusual. However, immediately following the incident, he suffered raised blisters across his chest and face. The blisters stung and burned if picked, but disappeared after a few days. Case Seven: Elm wood Cemetery On Nov. 4, 1957, another encounter occurred which indicates that UFOs show a strong interest in graveyards. At 3:12 A.M; that morning, Patrolman Joseph Lukasek, Patrolman Clifford Schau, and Fireman Robert Volt of Elmwood, IL, were in their squad car investigating a store which had an open window. Suddenly one of them spot- ted a strange bright red-orange egg-shaped object hov- ering 250 feet in the air, directly over the Elmwood Cem- etery. They turned the spotlight on the object and radioed Officer Daniel De Giovanni at the Elmwood police sta- tion that they were observing an \"unknown object.\" At that instant, the headlights and spotlight dimmed and flick- ered repeatedly. The object appeared to be \"folding into itself.\" But when they turned on the spotlight it \"puffed out,\" shot up 200 feet and took off. The officers chased after the Page 4 MUFON UFO Journal June 2002"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"object in their car, but hit a dead-end street. Still, they were able to watch the object \"fold inward from the bot- tom\" and disappear. Back at the Elmwood Park police station, officer De Giovanni ran outside just in time to observe the object shoot across town and disappear. Case Eight: Canyon Creek Burial Grounds In December, 1966, Rob McKinnon, a rest-area opera- tor, observed a bright beam of light \"hanging absolutely motionless in the air, maybe 100 feet up.\" McKinnon called his family and they all observed the light descend over the nearby burial ground. The witnesses observed that the huts containing the bodies were brightly lit by the beam. Said McKinnon, \"We definitely had a feeling it was interested in this place....there definitely was something strange happening out there over the cemetery that night.\" Case Nine: Aracariguama Cemetery In 1989, Nelson Oliveira, the local grave-digger for the Aracariguama Cemetery outside of Sao Paolo, Brazil, ex- perienced a dramatic graveyard encounter. According to an interview with South American ufologist Hermes de Fonseca, Oliveira observed a classic metallic flying sau- cer which he described as \"an upside-down hat\" made of aluminum. Oliveira observed the object hover low over the cemetery for several minutes before quickly flying away. Case Ten: Dean Memorial Cemetery This next case is without a doubt the most complex and chilling of all graveyard-UFO encounters. Investigated by veteran journalist Bob Teets, this case involves dozens of witnesses, all of whom have regularly seen UFOs hov- ering over the local graveyard in Elk Garden, WV. The sightings seem to concentrate over a particular area called Nethken Hill. However, the only thing on the hill is a small church surrounded by cemeteries, including Nethken Cemetery, Kalbaugh Cemetery, and the Dean Memorial Cemetery. The sightings began in the early 1960's and seem to be continuing today. The Jones family is only one of many families of this small town that have seen UFOs over the local cemetery. In April of 1968, two members of the family were driving by the graveyard when they saw a bright ball of light hov- ering overhead. Both watched as the 100-foot orange sphere moved brazenly over their vehicle. They could also now see a metallic structure to the object and could hear a high-pitched buzzing noise. Overcome with fear, they sped away. The object, how- ever, followed them home, hovering above their car. The terrified couple darted into the family home and woke up relatives, who came outside and also saw the object, which began to dart from place to place, and then left. Another family who has seen objects over the local graveyards are the Kalbaughs, who actually have their own family cemetery. Says Amie Kalbaugh, \"We'd see lights all during the late 1960's and early '70's going back and forth around the church area. [The church is adja- cent to the graveyard.] I never wanted to see them, but I did...We would watch the lights and go through a pro- cess of elimination, 'not a plane, not a helicopter,' and so forth, and try to figure out what they were...I always thought we heard a high-pitched sound, and then we would look out the window. The lights were always white.\" Amie's sister, Vickie, also remembers the sightings. She says, \"I saw a silvery white, elliptical-shaped thing in the sky. I was thinking, 'That's not an airplane or a heli- copter. ' Your mind plays tricks on you when you're fright- ened, and I remember being afraid... After these sightings, we were always so afraid.\" Another member of the Kalbaugh family, Clark Kalbaugh, reports his own encounter in mid-July 1970. Clark says, \"I was looking out the window toward Nethken Hill Cemetery when I saw an object moving in the sky over the cemetery...within a flash, it's right over the house! I'm looking directly up at the bottom of this object, which is possibly cigar-shaped to elliptical, somewhere in be- tween. A lot of bright lights on the bottom, very bright. Ten to fifteen bright lights. As quickly as it's there, bam! it's gone again. Then I see the lights toward Elk Garden, on Nethken Hill Cemetery again.\" Another witness to the Dean Memorial graveyard UFO sightings is local resident and mail-carrier Dixon Ridder. With his residence only one mile north of the graveyards, Dixon had an excellent view of the area. On one occasion, Dixon saw \"...a brilliant white light with a sharp outline of its edge...it was about five feet in di- ameter, and was just a few feet back from the church. All of a sudden, it went to the back of the church, then went across the road to that Dean Monument over there, where, just like you turn a light out, it vanished.\" The sightings became so frequent over the graveyard that residents would sometimes stake out the area just to see a UFO- Usually, nothing happened. But on one occasion, three people witnessed the granddaddy of UFO-graveyard encounters. On Oct. 8, 1967, Reverend Harley DeLeurere and two other local residents decided to head out to the grave- yards in order to see a UFO. They hiked to within a quarter mile of the area and waited to see what would happen. After 2 hours, they were startled by a bright flash of light. Seconds later they saw a classic flying saucer. As one witness described, \"...something like a big turtle with lights on it appeared level with the top of the house...it wasn't more than six feet off the ground, and it had three or four recessed lights on it that shined toward the graveyard and down on the ground too.\" As the three men watched, the object hovered low over each of the graveyards, shining down powerful beams of light as if searching for something. They then noticed a chilling detail. The object had stopped and tar- geted a particular gravesite with its beam of light. The only thing unusual about this gravesite was that it was very recent-only a day old. In fact, the funeral had just been held earlier that day! After several minutes of hovering over the gravesite June 2002 MUFON UFO Journal PageS"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"and shining down beams of light, the object \"disappeared.\" The three men inspected the area, but nothing seemed to be disturbed. Said one witness, \"We thought for sure we'd see something, but when we got there, there wasn't anything there.\" The Reverend recommended that the body be exhumed and examined for \"signs of disturbance.\" However, noth- ing was ever done. The witnesses were convinced that the UFO was showing a definite interest in the new grave. It was a pattern they would later observe on many occa- sions. Said one witness, \"It seemed like every time there was a new grave, within the next couple of nights, people would see lights up there.\" Case Eleven: Extraterrestrial graverobbers Why would aliens be interested in a graveyard? This next case may provide the answer, though perhaps not a very pleasant one. This case involves Pennsylvania teacher James L Walden. In March of 1992, Walden experienced his first fully conscious encounter with extraterrestrials. Later, under hypnosis, Walden recalled a lifetime of alien en- counters, beginning with his birth. According to his regression, he was actually implanted in his mother's womb by the aliens. His DNA, however, has a different source. As he says under hypnosis, \"I am a composite of other people and beings. Some parts of me came from humans; others came from aliens. I'm not unique. I am composed of parts of all the people who were used to create me!\" In other words, Walden is saying that his embryo was created from genes harvested from a number of different people. He says, \"I saw the alien beings harvesting brain cells from dying human bodies, then combining the cells to make my embryo....! see the corpses of two men and one woman. When they died, the aliens-who cannot be seen by humans-are present, and they retrieve tissue samples to use in creating me....the woman's corpse was the most vivid. I didn't recognize her...\" Conclusions & speculations As can be seen, aliens have definitely shown a strong interest in graveyards. But again, the question is why? What is it about graveyards that extraterrestrials find so attractive? Could it be simple curiosity, or is there an- other explanation? UFO researchers Coral and Jim Lorenzen had their own speculations. They explain, \"The Edmonton cem- etery report is one of many involving strange objects near cemeteries or old burial grounds...when the two reports- the object over the funeral home and the object over the cemetery-are considered alone, they don't make much sense; they just give one a kind of queasy feeling about possible supernatural phenomena. However, when con- sidered in context with hundreds of sightings of objects following cars, especially at night, a faint connection is possible. \"UFOs have been following cars at night for years. At night, cars have their headlights on. Whether or not curiosity is the motivation for these antics, we cannot tell, but if intelligent beings are behind these visits, then they also might well be curious about a long line of cars driving about in the daytime with their lights on when no lights are needed-the typical behavior of funeral processions, indicating to other traffic that it is a funeral procession. \"If intelligent beings in a hovering craft became curi- ous about such an event, they then might indeed try to find out the purpose of such a procession. They could note that a box was brought out of a building, put into one vehicle, followed by others, and taken to a certain area where the box was removed and buried in the ground. So they might try to discern what a funeral home is, and ultimately, a cemetery.\" That the aliens are intensely curious in human affairs is pretty obvious. It could very well be that the above cases show only that UFOs are studying yet another as- pect of human society. Well-known UFO investigator Scott Corrales has ex- amined several cases like these. He speculates that \"the UFOs were engaged in the business of retrieving alien implants...\" He asks, \"Why are the UFOs interested in our final resting places? What could they stand to gain from such pursuits? Trying to ascribe reason to an utterly unreasonable phenomenon leads us to consider that 'alien scientists' can glean important biological information from the deceased, or as suggested in the West Virginia sce- nario, we are witnessing a clean-up operation aimed at removing implants left in the bodies of long-time abductees.\" There is always the possibility that the aliens are a little more than just curious. Could it be that the aliens are, in fact, actively engaged in the systematic exhumation and exploitation of human corpses? After all, the only thing of any interest in a graveyard are the bodies. Why else would UFOs shine a beam of light down on a freshly dug grave? Although this is pure speculation, the UFOs' in- terest in graveyards is not. The Dean Memorial Cemetery and Walden cases strengthen the theory that at least some aliens may be robbing graves for the express purpose of obtaining ge- netic material. And if one wanted to obtain the DNA from a certain person with the least possible disturbance, waiting until the person actually died makes a lot of sense. Interestingly, genetic material remains alive for a period of days following biological death. This would explain why the UFOs over the Dean Memorial Cemetery not only targeted the brand new graves, but reportedly ap- peared every time there had been a new grave dug. Also, consider the following report from veteran UFO investigators Raymond Fowler and Walter Webb. Writes Fowler, \"One afternoon, [summer 1964] Walter phoned to say that he had received a tip concerning an alleged UFO landing near a cemetery at Lawrence, MA. Would I be willing to assist in his investigations? I excitedly agreed.\" That evening, they interviewed a group of children who claimed to have seen an object land next to the cemetery. They explored the graveyard, but were unable to find anything unusual. Then came the shocking news. As Page 6 MUFON UFO Journal June 2002"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"Fowler writes, \"A few days later, a fellow employee in- formed me that there had been a grave robbery in this same cemetery that very week, and the Lawrence police had staked it out! What would we have said if the police had caught us creeping from tombstone to tombstone?\" Further evidence supporting the theory of alien grave- robbers comes from researcher Bill Knell. Following a rash of animal mutilations, rumors began to circulate among the UFO community that there were also cases of human mutilations. Bill Knell tracked down one such rumor to a medical examiner in Westchester County, NY, who in- formed Knell that several morgues in the area had been \"hit\" and \"fresh human cadavers\" were mutilated in the same style as the well-known cattle mutilations. In this case, the damage included partial removal of the face, and total removal of the eyes, thyroid, stomach, and genitals. Knell was informed by the anonymous medi- cal examiner that the morgues in question quickly enacted a cover-up, and that the public was never told the truth. If these speculations are true, an interesting experi- ment might be to stake out cemeteries immediately fol- lowing the placement of any new coffins with human re- mains. Even more interesting would be a study of the already targeted gravesites. In other words, is there any evi- dence that the body was disturbed? Whose grave is it, and why would:the aliens be interested in them? Have they had any prior UFO experiences? Are the gravesites of recently deceased UFO abductees likely to cause an encounter? Are those individuals in the graves geneti- cally unique or unusual in any way? These, of course, are mysteries that remain to be solved.

After he received numerous requests for transcripts, here is the translation of their statements by Valery Uvarov, St. Petersburg) Cosmonaut Maj. Gen. Vladimir Kovalyonok, Saljut VI Mission, 1981 Many cosmonauts have seen phenomena which are far beyond the experiences of earthmen. For ten years I never spoke on such things. The encounter you asked me about happened on May 5, 1981, at about 6 PM, during the Saljut Mission. At that time we were over the area of South Africa, moving towards the area of the Indian ocean. I just made some gymnastic exercises, when I saw in front of me, through a porthole, an object which I could not explain. It is impossible to determine distances in Space. A small object can appear large and far away and the other way around. Sometimes a cloud of dust appears like a large object. Anyway, I saw this object and then something happened I could not explain, something impossible ac- cording to the laws of physics. The object had this shape, elliptical, and flew with us. From a frontal view it looked like it would rotate in flight direction. It only flew straight, but then a kind of explosion hap- pened, very beautiful to watch, of golden light. This was the first part. Then, one or two seconds later, a second explosion followed somewhere else and two spheres ap- peared, golden and very beautiful. After this explosion I just saw white smoke, then a cloud-like sphere. Before we entered the darkness, we flew through the terminator, the twilight-zone between day and night. We flew eastwards, and when we entered the darkness of the Earth shadow, I could not see them any longer. The two spheres never returned. Cosmonaut Musa Manarov, MIR mission, 1991 It happened during a visit mission, when all our atten- tion was focused on the slowly approaching space cap- sule. I was close to the great porthole, from where I could see our approaching visitors. I watched everything very carefully... When the capsule came closer, I filmed it with a professional Betacam camera. Suddenly I noted something below the spaceship, which first looked like a kind of antenna. Only when I looked closer and analyzed the situation, I realized that there was no antenna at all. But first I thought it was a part of the construction. But then this element started to move. It moved away from The MIR space station the ship; So I grabbed the radio and told them: \"Hey, Boys, you are losing some- thing.\" This, of course, alarmed them. With all my experience, espe- cially with dock- ing maneuvers in space, I can tell you that especially in this phase simply nothing can break off at all. If some- thing would have been loose, it would have been torn off long before, during the launch, the maneuvers, the turn, all these much more energetic flight phases. Now we were just gliding slowly towards each other, without any pressure on the capsule. But then this \"some- thing\" started to remove downwards. When it flew away, it attracted all our attention. It looked like it was rotating. It was difficult to estimate its dimensions. If it was close or far away I could not say; it was in free sight, and in space it is difficult to estimate any size and distance. I can only say for sure that it was not very close, since I set the camera for infinity. If it would have been just a screw or something close to us, it would have been out of focus. The object was quite far away. In any case at least 300 feet, since this was the distance of the space capsule, and I had the im- pression that it was beyond it. It is possible that it was a kind of UFO. We can't say with any certainty what it was. It was definitely not a bigger piece of space junk, no rocket part or so, since this would have been located... the space surveillance, ours and the American, locate all bigger objects in space. They are followed, for every minute we know their posi- tion and flight direction. If such an object would have come so close to the MIR, they would have located it and informed us. I don't think it was a piece of space junk or debris. There is a lot of that in the Earth orbit-Satellite parts, rocket parts, just everything-but our space surveillance locates them, and according to them there was nothing...

Pavel Romanowich Popovich Soviet Air Force I had only one personal encounter with something un- known, something we could not explain. It was in 1978, when we flew from Washington to Moscow. We flew in an altitude of 30,600 feet. Arid suddenly, when I looked through the windshield I noticed something flying about 4,500 feet above us on a parallel course-a glowing white equilateral triangle resembling a sail. Since our speed was 600 mph, the triangle must have had a speed of at least 900 mph, since it overtook us! I called the attention of all passengers and crew-mem- bers on it. We tried to find out what it was, but all at- tempts to identify it as something known ultimately failed. This object looked like a UFO, and it remained unidenti- fied. It did not look like an airplane, since it was a perfect triangle. No airplane at that time had such a shape. Col. Gen. Gennadij Reshetnikov, Head of the Gen. Zhukoy High Command Academy of Air Defense, Tver Yes, there were particularly mysterious occurrences during military practice. At times targets appeared, on which fighters in the air or radars set for anti-aircraft missiles trained themselves, but it was difficult to deter- mine what they were exactly. There were situations when a target answered to the signal \"I'm your plane\" (we have such a system of inquiry.) Or the other way around, it wouldn't answer at all. It was considered in- comprehensible. Moreover, I'm aware of situations when, as planes which had been sent into the air were opening their side sites, 'they discovered a target. But when it reached the determined distance when the automatic weapons sys- tem which dispatched missiles should have operated, sud- denly the system broke ^down. Everything disappeared, even the target.  . Or maybe the plane warped through space to another position. They conducted another attack-again the same result. There were such interesting and mysterious oc- currences. Now, when I find myself in the Army Institute of Higher Learning, I know that there were attempts at similar re- search. There were several definite scientifically-re- searched studies on ufological topics. But they didn't find a wide distribution for them. Judging, in essence, by the situation of things, I mean that they couldn't find any prac- tical applications for the incorporation of the results of the scientifically-researched developments. In this way, the problem of UFOs in the terminological sense, of how it figures into ufology, isn't followed in the affairs of the military right now. And it wasn't fol- lowed earlier. I want to emphasize, that if an unidentified target reveals itself in space, then it's displayed on our radars. Sometimes it happens that it's seen visibly. Some- times signals are simply received from citizen eye-wit- nesses. Such information was also received from border posts after visual sightings, and from other sources, and we never throw it out. Verifications are absolutely con- ducted. But I'm not able to say that this work is taken with a scientific approach. It's conducted within the framework of the administrative attitude towards this problem. In my opinion that's how things stand in the different branches of the Armed Forces....We try to take into account the problem of UFOs. Quite a bit of interesting material has appeared, and it's perfectly obvious it needs to be studied in earnest, and that it's necessary to address this question on a governmental level. Right now you are more and more inclined to believe that UFOs exist. But what stands behind this? The first you think of are extraterrestrial visitors...A bit earlier, at the end of the 1970's and the start of the 1980's, I flew to the Arctic Circle, to the place where eye-witnesses had seen some kind of cigar-shaped apparatus with portholes: This was how the press in this area was de- scribing it: It happened in the region of Norilsk. The object was seen several times. Traces were discovered but no one conducted any kind of serious research there. When it became known to me, I flew there in a helicopter in order to examine the place; we even traveled out to the same place one more time, but we didn't succeed in noticing anything special. Concerning the ascent of airplanes, in particular, when we were in the framework of the Soviet Union it's neces- sary to say that battle duties were kept up rigidly, and we sent up planes without all kinds of restrictions. Immedi- ately upon my order, planes went up many, many times. For example, in those situations which I just recounted during my service. Now we send up planes very deliberately on account of economic conditions. But I personally for many times have ordered aircraft to determine if something is a UFO or not-they were unidentified targets for us. Yes, there have been several cases in which they turned out to be mysterious, unknown targets on which the different de- tecting systems reacted, including our land, sea, and air- June 2002 MUFON UFO Journal Page 9"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"space surveillance. Sometimes our weapon systems were activated because of them. Maj. Gen. Vasily Alexeyev Russian Air Force Space Communications Center Moscow If we are speaking about my military capacity, it was in the 1980s when I happened to be serving not in a regu- lar unit, but in the central staff. Work in the central staff entails close links with the units in the field and a large amount of travelling. There were many reports from unit level regarding a large number of observations of unex- plained phenomena. You should bear in mind that at that time much was simply denied. The subject was to a large extent a closed one. On the ground, however, people wanted to find out what was what, to separate truth from fiction. In that period a lot of things were presented in such a way that you lost the desire to believe: Accordingly an attitude to the subject became established, where not only was there no desire to believe, it was even undesirable to be- lieve. Nevertheless the information coming in from the bases was of interest, if only because it was not merely talk and rumors; there were eye-witnesses to phenomena, and that was reflected in specific documents and the reports of officials. At times this information was of such a fasci- nating nature that it was impossible not to believe it. Later the question no longer seemed so fantastic and began to be examined at the level not only of the Defense Ministry, but of other government departments as well. This interest specifically expressed itself in certain ex- perts being sent to investigate, especially to those places where UFOs, let's call them that, appeared quite fre- quently. I know a whole number of military bases in that category. As a rule they are objects of strategic signifi- cance, rocket complexes, scientific test establishments, in other words the places where there is a high concen- tration of advanced science and, to some degree, danger. Because every nuclear rocket, every new Air force installation represents a breakthrough, both in science and in military terms, it is first and foremost a peak, the sum- mit of human achievement. And that is where UFOs ap- peared fairly often. Moreover, individual officers and commanders on the spot who knew about the phenomenon and had no official instructions on the matter, acted on their own initiative to investigate UFOs, recording data, and so on. I know that in some places they even learned to create a situation which would deliberately provoke the appearance of a UFO. A UFO would appear where there was increased military activity connected, say, with the transportation of \"special\" loads. It was enough to artificially stimulate or schedule such a move for a UFO to appear. In other words, some kind of conditional.relationship emerged. And they detected it. We're an intelligent nation, nothing escapes us. I know that at certain testing ranges-I won't name them, although it's no longer a secret-they even learnt to make contact of a kind. What did that consists of? First the UFO ap- peared; in most instances it was a sphere, but there were other kinds. Contact was achieved with the help of physical indica- tions of behavior-pointing your arms in various directions, say, and the sphere became flattened in the same direc- tion. If you raised your arms three times, the UFO flat- tened out in a vertical direction three times as well. In the early 1980s, on the instructions of the then Soviet leader- ship, experiments using technical devices (theodolites, radar stations, and others) were carried out, as a result of which the unidentified objects were firmly recorded as instrumental data. VU: Can you say on what level those researches took place? While studying the material from those observa- tions and the contents of certain documents I formed the impression that the prime reason for circulars and orders on this matter in the armed forces was that they most likely considered UFOs a new sort of weapon belonging to some hostile country. Isn't that why orders were is- sued on the rigorous investigation and examination of the appearance and behavior of UFOs by all available ways and means? What was the nature of the recording, on instruments and in written documents, of the time of ap^ pearance, trajectory and other characteristics? VA: I think that on the whole there were two reasons. First, a great deal of information of various kinds was coming in from all over. I know of a case when workers from one of the research establishments outside Moscow flew to Novosibirsk, I think it was to investigate an air crash. When they came back they wrote a report that they had had an encounter with a UFO that accompanied their plane in the air. Bei ng sensible people and inclined to scientific analysis, they managed to share out their roles so that during the observation some watched and dic- tated, others sketched, a third group kept track of time. In that way the observation acquired a certain scientific grounding. It wasn't just a sighting, but a scientific team at work, carrying out a sort of real-time experiment. Reports of UFO sightings came in regularly. And evi- dently somewhere nearer the core of our leadership in the sphere of the Defense Ministry, the Academy of Sci- ences and so on, a lot of this kind of information began to build up. And not only from ordinary laymen, but from scientists and professionals as well. Military men in general are not inclined to fantasize. They only report what they see, what actually occurs. They are people you can believe.    , You should not forget that the arms race was still going on at this time, a struggle for military and other priorities. New discoveries in science and technology were being made all the time. The UFOs were something new and not understood. And there really was an idea that they might be some means of gathering intelligence. MUFON MUGS Official MUFON ceramic mugs with blue logo, $8.00, plus $3.50 S&H. MUFON, P.O.

I ^have been very busy researching the way^the UFO phenomenon emerges in folklore for what I hope will be a useful contribution to the field. After look- ing into this issue for many years there is no doubt in my mind that folklore and ufology overlapped in the first half of the twentieth century, and that this overlap is stronger than what many writers have shown so far. A chapter of my book (Return to Magonia) discusses \"the Greys\"from a historical perspective. I take the fol- lowing notes from there. 1) General physical descriptions of the fairy folk. There are many instances in \"fairy folklore\" in which a strong physical resemblance existed between fairy enti- ties and aliens. Examples: (a) \"Like the bogle or the barguest, he often has very large eyes, as big as saucers, and his nose may be some- rimes very small, hardly more than two nostrils.\" (Edwards) (19th/early 20th century sources in brackets-I can pro- vide complete bibliographical references if anyone's in- terested) '    . (b) The fairy known as the Glaistig had grey skin. Her name, in fact, derives from Gaelic (\"glas\") and meant \"grey.\". The Banshi also had skin the color of lead. (Campbell) (c) There was even a color known as \"elfin grey.\" (Spence) (d) \"their clothes were seamless, and it was impossible to say by merely looking at them whether they were male or female.\" (Spence) 2) Grey Men in 19th century abduction narratives Grey-colored beings often featured in tales of fairy abduction (and let's not forget that the term \"abduction\" was itself used by folklorists generations before ufologists began to employ it. Thus we find, for example, nineteen page references under \"Abduction of People\" in the in- dex of Evans-Wentz's The Fairy Faith in Celtic Coun- tries (1911), etc). Examples: (a) \"and there was not a man at all of them higher than about three feet and a half, and some of them were grey and seemed very odd.\" (Yeats) (b) \"five little creatures\" a foot and a half high and \"greyish in colour like fungus\" (Briggs) 3) Close Encounters The beings were very often referred to as \"grey,\" ei- ther with, grey skin or grey clothes. Examples: (a) After being enticed by \"twinkling lights\" a farmer meets \"slim, unearthly creatures, about three feet in height, wearing grey, with red caps.\" (Miller) (b) Ugly, stunted creatures wearing long grey cloaks. (Keightley) 4) Narratives concerning otherworldly babies given to mortals. There was really no important difference between fairy changelings and the \"hybrid babies\" described in abduc- tion accounts. (a) The Banshi would tell the human foster mother that the child she held was not hers with the words \"Grey is your child.\" The mother in one story replied in verse thus: \"Grey is the foliage, grey the flowers, And grey the axe that has a handle, And nought comes through the earth But has greyness in its nature.\" (Campbell) (b) A changeling was known for its \"wan and wrinkled appearance, its long fingers, and slightly bony develop- ment.\" (Spence) \"sallow skins... misshapen, peevish creatures\" (Johnson) \"old-faced, big-headed\" (Rieti) \"sickly, fretful\" would never cry (Simpson). Compare Jacobs and his abductees on hybrid babies in Secret Life: \"... odd. They look kind of old... grayish... they don't look healthy... scrawny... not a lot of fat or muscle\" (p. 166- 167) \"very large head for its body... its body is long and thin...Its hands and fingers are long and thin\" \"phlegmatic and sickly\" (p. 162) hybrids don't cry (p. 163), etc. 5) Extraterrestrial origin of fairy folk Something that is never mentioned in debates about the fairy-alien connection is the fact that fairies were sometimes believed to be from other planets. Thus we find, in books on folklore predating ufology by decades, comments like: \"[They] were only visitors to this world, and had no terrestrial habitations\" and \"The king of [the fairies]... his residence was in the stars\" or \"they are a big [in number] race who come from the planets\" ' In closing I'd just like to add that I treat these matters as a historian/folklorist, and have come to no personal opinion about UFO reality (or lack thereof). However, if it's the original grey man that's sought, the first reference to him in ufology is only the beginning of the story. If it's true there's no 100% exact parallel of the \"Grey\" in pre-1900 folklore (and here we've just skimmed the surface), it's also true that it's not always easy to find two identical \"greys\" in modern abduction reports, either. Considering the fact that we obtain most of the de- scriptions we have of them through hypnosis, often pen- etrating \"screen memories\" of animals and so forth, the correlations are quite impressive.

I am now 62, but in the 1960's I worked in broadcast television. Beginning in 1957, 1 started work after high school with two stations in Virginia, and in 1960, after I moved to California, I obtained work with several TV stations locally, including KGO-TV, the ABC Owned and Operated station in San Francisco. At that time I was a member of the Production Department. One of the station's new directors at that time was named Mel Swope, and knowing of my interest in UFOs, he invited me to produce a half-hour program on the sub- ject. Since I knew of MUFON, I contacted Paul Cerny, who I believe at that time was the State Director for Northern California. He consented to appear on the pro- gram, which was then videotaped for later airing. (The program aired in late summer 1964.) I wrote and produced the show-like one of today's themed talk shows, but I'm sorry I cannot recall the show name, which featured different topics each week. At any rate, after the program, Paul gave me the en- closed 8\" by 10' 1 glossy black and white photo (this is a copy) of a UFO that he described on the air. He showed me several photos of the same craft, and in the other versions, the under gear appeared to be rotating. ' Here is the data that I inscribed on the back of the photo after he gave it to me: \"Picture taken by a Naval Officer aboard a U.S. Navy ship off Southern California in 1957. This is an enlargement. The device at the base of the UFO (landing gear?) - as shown in several other pho- tos - had rotated around the craft.\" Paul gave no other explanation to me about the craft, but I am certain he had the sighting and the photos under investigation. Although the photo I have is a reprint and an enlarge- ment of the original, I doubt it was ever subjected to com- puter analysis, because the photo was taken during the 1950's, about 45 years ago. I also strongly doubt that the photo was computer generated, since that technology, as far as I know, did not exist then. I suppose another expla- nation might be possible, however. I have read hundreds of books on UFOs and related aerial phenomena and have never seen this photo included in any book or other UFO source material. Have you seen the photo before? If so, where? Do you think that if the photo were published in the UFO Journal, someone out there might be able to shed more light on it? The information I am giving you is to the best of my recollection, and Paul Cerny passed away a few years back, so I have no one else to turn to. I am curious as to this sighting, and especially so be- cause this was a military sighting. The photo shows a The photo sent by Mr. Mattingley. dark area beneath the craft, in apparent shadow, but the top is in apparent sunlight. Because the craft is unfortu- nately shrouded in darkness, few other details are ca- pable of being identified. I do wish I had been able to obtain the other photos which were in Paul's possession, because they definitely showed the rotation of the under gear. I would appreciate your response when you have the time. Keep up the good work. I think if you were to ask the membership if they have access to UFO photos taken prior to the mid-Seventies, you may get some. I am not a computer generation expert, but I think those photos (taken prior to 1975) would preclude faking, as long as the source was identified as competent.

There are a million hiding places for small bits of metal. It was a warm day, but surprisingly cold on the field. I had the feeling that there must be some metal left, and that un- derground radar may be able to detect its presence. It would cost about $20,000 to have an underground survey of the site.

He was out at Grand Lake O'The Cherokee, OK, watching a UFO for about two hours searching the coastline. It was a round object hov- ering just above the shoreline and about 100 feet inland three miles south of Sail Boat Bridge. \"The UFO appeared to have a row of round portals around the outer edge, each spaced maybe ten feet apart, but they were not lit up, although they may have been some objects or equipment, rather than portals. The UFO had a red bottom and a blue top, a possible reflection of the red and blue lights revolving around it. \"He was observing from a high hill overlooking a large horsershoe-shaped cove on the lake, and the UFO was below him. He watched balls of light leave from a hole that opened in the top. They zigzagged back and forth along the edge of the water in large 100 feet or more, zigzags, like they were looking for something in a military search pattern. The larger UFO followed and then moved 500 feet back from the shore, and when it got to the east- ern point of the cove it moved toward over the balls of light. He yelled, 'Hold it! It's coming in to pick them up. There they go into the thing from the bottom, up into it. Oh, oh. It's leaving. It's going up, straight up, fast!' \"There was a big flash from the bottom of the craft just before it began to rise up, 'like maybe it was revving up for the assent.' By this time my husband Richard and I, in Eureka Springs, Ar, had reached the front of our porch to look. Mr. X said, 'Look just to the left of the big dipper. It's almost gone.' \"We were looking, but at first we saw nothing in the clear sky. Suddenly we saw a slow but short 'strobe- quality' flash just a bit larger than the largest planets. Then ten seconds later another one higher and further north than the first one. Then six seconds later, another one, until we saw five in all, moving north and up to the left side of the dipper. \"Mr. X was exclaiming something with each blink, just as we were. We were obviously watching the same thing from perhaps a hundred miles distance. The light was definitely not an aircraft light, and was brilliant and ir- regular in timing of the flashes, each one becoming a bit dimmer than the last. Richard saw it as less than brilliant white, more cream color light. But clearly we all were watching, the same thing.\" Thanks to Jean & Richard Seifried, seifried@ipa.net, Eureka Springs, AR 72632 Mutilations & lights in Argentina SALLIQUELO — A few days ago strange lights appeared in the night skies over Saliquello, Province of Buenos Aires, and in the morning cattle ranchers of the area found three mutilated bovines showing signs of hav- ing undergone a surgical intervention with unusual imple- ments. A veterinarian told local media that the incisions \"are strange ones in which some sort of heating element appears to have been used.\" The news was broadcast at the national level on Sat- urday through Cronica TV, which took images from the local cable access channel, showing images of the ani- mals and a technician named Daniel, who analyzed one of the cases, providing details on the strange event. According to the televised report, the animals were found by the owners of rural premises near Salliquelo, a small city located some 80 miles east of the Pampan lo- cality of Anchorena, after \"strange lights\" were reported in the sky. The bovine deaths were attested to by police. A veterinarian inspected the abnormal carcasses, \"They present strange cuts, as though resulting from an intense June 2002 MUFON UFO Journal Page 13"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"heat source. The skin is burned along the edges of the cuts, and the absence of blood in veins, muscles and liga- ments is simply desiccated.\" He said, \"It!s as.though you were cutting a piece of paper with a hot wire-the edges become'dry, scorched and thinner. Furthermore, all traces of blooft vanished. We only found some coagulated re- mains in the heart.\" Daniel told the Saliquello TV that unusual cuts can be seen in-the animals' bodies and heads. \"One of them shows a perfectly straight cut on one mandible. Furthermore, its tongue is missing along with most of the alimentary tract, larynx, pharynx and saliva glands. The outer ear is com- pletely missing. Another curious incision appears on the body (ribs and abdomen) which is teardrop-shaped through which genitalia was extracted,\" he explained. \"It is a strange circumstance since there are no signs that the animal put up a fight, nor is there any evidence of scorched pastureland. I'm not saying that this is the handi- work of alien beings, but it's a strange circumstance none- theless. Even the other animals refuse to come close to the dead ones, and curiosity is a characteristic element of bovines,\" he concluded.   ; Intense bright lights were filmed over Argentina on April 18, 2002, by Ricardo e d'angelo.

The woman and her boyfriend were driving home from Durango to Pagosa Springs at 9:45 PM, when they saw a gigantic ball of light over the San Juan Mountains near Chimney Rock. \"The woman said it was terribly bright, and difficult to watch for very long. It stayed in one spot for five min- utes and appeared to be a huge disc with an incredibly bright light. The woman said. 'We thought it was really big-at least the size of a football field, twice as large as a full moon and was many times larger than a normal air- plane. Other car lights were coming at us, and as soon as we saw headlights the UFO would turn into something like a plane's blinking lights.' \"She said, 'It was as though the UFO were trying to disguise itself, and the strange thing was no car ever passed us on the highway, and we never saw what happened to the cars. We felt like we were on the highway by our- selves. We watched for 10 to 15 minutes but we didn't pull over and just continued driving. '\"We both kept getting surges of weird energy, that were'like huge rushes the whole time we saw it,' she said.' 'We felt really weird since it was so powerful and I was almost crying. The UFO was kind of greenish-blue with red lights on it,' the woman added. 'There were little ships hovering above and below it. The object approached and flew right over our car and I could see hundreds and hundreds of windows on it,' said the woman. 'Then it just moved on, and we didn't see it anymore.' \"The next day she called her parents and told them about the sighting. I asked if there had been any missing time, but she said no, they got home at the time'they ex- pected. However, there was one incident worth men- tioning. The woman had been pregnant, and just a few days after the sighting she experienced a miscarriage.

Object speeds and stops in New Mexico ALAMOGORDO — On April 24, 2002, the witness was east of Florida Ave., north of Indian Wells, in the extreme northeast portion of the city at dusk, with the sun setting above the outline of the Sacramento Mountains to the east. The witness was sitting on her porch facing east, and.she suddenly observed a light over.the moun- tains. The light was about the size of a nickel held a foot in front of her face.  ,  v She watched the light for several minutes, and the light would ascend above the outline of the mountains and then descend below the outline of the mountains.

Strange police report in Indiana NEW ALBANY — Kathleen Keith reports that on May 11, 2002, she was listening to a police scanner \"up north\" (still in Indiana) and heard that a UFO had come down and landed on the road and blew someone's car(?) orperson(?) right off the road. That was all they heard. Later they checked out the news broadcasts and the pa- pers, and there was no mention of it. \"You would think that if it came down on the road there would be a lot of people who would have seen it,\" says Kathleen. Large triangular object in Illinois SCOTT AIR FORCE BASE - K. Chadwick reports that on Monday, April 29, \"My daughter and I were trav- eling up towards St. Louis on 1-57. About 10 P.M. we spotted a bright light north of us that behaved strangely, then seemed to hover, which we lost from our line of sight. About an hour later, south of St. Louis on 1-64 (north) we saw what looked like the same light (brighter than the brightest star) again, and my daughter was look- ing right at it, perfect visibility, as it disappeared. \"We pulled off the interstate just past the Scott AFB exit and saw 3 craft very low to the ground, moving ex- tremely slowly. They appeared to have 3 big lights at the front of the craft. As we came to a stop in a gas station lot, we got out and looked up at a triangular craft (not raked-winged, perfectly triangular), approximately the size of a basketball held at arm's length. Its shape was very well outlined by the starry sky, and it was totally stopped directly overhead. \"We heard what appeared to be jet aircraft sounds, although not as loud as you would expect by its proximity. I can't help but think all these sightings are related, and wonder who are piloting these craft, which we know noth- ing about, in our skies.\" Thanks to Chadwick, qualitywalls@webtv.net Mystery disk over Colorado airport TELLURIDE — On May 3,2002, a large disc-shaped craft with a dome on top was seen hovering over Tellu- ride Airport. The craft was as large as a 747 jet aircraft. At 3 A.M. locals there reported that supplies were arriv- ing at the airport by transport and going up the highway by transport under heavy security. Black helicopters also flew in the area. He surmises that this was an ongoing supply operation for a base nearby, most likely Idarado Mine. He said that that mine was purchased before public listing was made available, \"off the market\" several years ago by someone connected to Ford Motor Co. Idarado Mine reportedly has 360 miles of runnels un- der a mountain ridge with a western entrance located about 2 miles east of Telluride, and the eastern portal about I1 miles south of Ouray. The Idarado mines and mill operated until 1978. Thanks to Christopher O'Brian, au- thor of Enter the Valley. Daylight sighting in Canada OTTAWA, ONTARIO — Brian Vike reports that on Saturday April 17,2002, on Montreal Road in Vanier, across from a graveyard, there was a daylight sighting of a UFO. The witness reports, \"I work in a convent as a chef and I am the only smoker in the building, and I have to go out- side. I was on my lunch break 12:30 RM. when I saw what looked like a small airplane coming from the north- east. As it got closer, I noticed that it was oval shaped and changing color from black to silver. The sighting lasted for about a minute and disappeared behind a large cloud. \"The size of the craft was about 25 to 30 feet long and about 15 to 20 feet wide at the front. The craft was black and silver and rocking side to side at about 300 feet high as it changed color. It flew behind a cloud and disap- peared.\" Thanks to Brian Vike UFO activity in Cuba HAVANA—Mike Bird, reporting on his recent trip, says, \"An intense wave of UFO activity has taken place in Cuba in recent years.\" Havana-based researchers have made a series of documentaries and books. He was able to interview five UFO researchers, the oldest a 70-year- old retired physics professor who had his own sighting in 1954, and the youngest about 30 years old. They had never been in contact with North American researchers, and gave Bird a 300-page book entitled Signos, about the rich history of UFO activity in Cuba. The Cuban military has blamed UFOs on US aircraft used for reconnaissance. A Cuban farmer, Adolfo Zarate, saw a UFO land 60 meters away in a rainstorm . He reports, \"A being that looked human wearing a gas mask and dressed in cam- ouflaged clothes climbed down a ladder that lowered out of the camouflaged grass-colored UFO. The pilot got down and inspected the craft. He spoke to someone in the cockpit. I think he was collecting some rice shoots or ripping out a 'malanga' (coco-yam) plant. \"After the being climbed up a ladder, the UFO flew off in a burst of blue fire. The only thing I felt was the pressure of the air expelled through its exhaust. The craft was the size of a touring machine. There were no wings or propellers and it made no sound. It looked like a flat- tened, egg or a turtle that landed on two legs, like shock absorbers. \"To me, the device had skates, because it left its wheels well marked. The being's face could not be seen, but he resembled a normal man. I didn't notice him bearing arms,\" he told the Sunday newspaper Juventud Rebelde de Cuba.

Lang MS CHt Jhe close encounter can be either a terrifying ex- |\" perience or a wonderful event. For many, it is a time when one is confronted, overpowered, and taken against one's will by unexplainable, unearthly be- ings for reasons that the individual cannot hope to com- prehend. It is a dark and sinister force in the world of the experiencer. But the close encounter can also be a moment of con- tact with a power greater than one's self. It can be a time of communion and enlightenment-a chance to meet face to face with a wonderful source of light in our uni- verse. Some see the encounter phenomenon as dark, and some as light. Yet, in most cases, the events described in en- counters are quite similar. So what makes the differ- ence? Could the emotional nature of the experience be affected by our own consciousness? Does this show that our perceptual filters profoundly affect the good/evil-ness of the phenomenon? Can we, using a healing modality such as hypnotherapy, resolve the good-evil polarity that often comes with close encounter experiences? In this article, we will look at some cases which show that the phenomenon has both positive and negative ele- ments-a mixed bag that seems to defy the good-evil du- ality. These cases are taken from my own case files with names and key details altered to protect the.anonymity of the experiencers. They are representative of those which I have studied, and which fill researchers' files. In these, we can see that the experiencer's consciousness can do a lot to frame the reality of an encounter, for good or ill. \"Evelyn\"-Managing the fear One case which most graphically illustrates fear re- sulting from the phenomenon is that of an experiencer I will call \"Evelyn.\" Evelyn has had many close encoun- ters-both physical and metaphysical in nature. When I first interviewed her, an extensive chronology of events emerged-along with a deep sense of fear. As she described her many experiences, the fear seemed to grow until it became an almost-physical pres- ence in the room. Its effects on her life were causing her difficulty. She found herself becoming anxious at times when she was alone in the house, and at other times which reminded her of the UFO topic. Our initial field investigation had occurred before I had begun my study of hypnosis. Some time later when I had become certified as a hypnotherapist, we arranged a session. As we began the first hypnotic work, the fear again showed itself with its full brutal force. I could only admire her courage as she, despite a look of terror on her face, told me she still wanted to continue with her regres- sion. About the Author Craig R. Lang is a Certified Hypnotherapist with the National Guild of Hypnotists, and is a Field Investigator with MUFON. He resides and has his hypnotherapy prac- tice in Minneapolis, MN. He conducts UFO and close encounter research in the Twin Cities area and in sur- rounding areas within Minnesota and Wisconsin. He can be reached by e-mail at crlang(g),mm.com. The Minnesota MUFON website can be reached at www.visi.com/~ihenrv. Evelyn wanted to get to the bottom of her experiences, to put them to rest once and for all. We decided that in the next session, we would try to manage the fear she felt, and then continue on with regression work. Parts and the fabric of the mind The human mind can be thought of as being made up of a large number of parts (also referred to as ego states). Each is built around thought complexes, feelings, memo- ries, ideas, etc.-and together they interweave to form the fabric of consciousness. At times, however, individual parts can behave independently, and sometimes can even come into conflict with one another. During deep hypnosis, parts can be addressed individu- ally, and issues between them can be resolved. In this case, once Evelyn was in a deep hypnotic trance, an in- ner child aspect of her mind-scape came forward which had learned from childhood religious schooling that the unknown was evil-a thing to be feared. This part had done its job well. Whenever Evelyn would have signifi- cant thoughts or memories related to the UFO phenom- enon, this part would inject fear into her awareness. Conversely, with Evelyn still in deep trance, another part of her mind emerged which was inquisitive and deeply spiritual, and which very much wanted to explore her ex- periences. Having built a rapport with both parts, it was now pos- sible to address the concerns of the \"Fear\" part, fostering an agreement between it and the \"Spiritual Explorer.\" Once a deal was struck, as long as both parts kept their end of it, the fear should no longer be an issue. Both parts agreed, and Evelyn felt them merge back into the overall tapestry of her mind-and I eagerly waited to see the results. It worked-even better than I had hoped. The fear that had plagued Evelyn for so long quickly abated. In subse- quent sessions, she was able to explore her experiences extensively. What had seemed like a dark scenario could now be looked at much more objectively. As with any aspect of life, there were both positive and negative ele- ments to her encounters. But from now on the phenom- enon would be objective and manageable to her, yet would still be a deeply meaningful part of her life. Page 16 MUFON UFO Journal June 2002"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"\"Mark\" and \"Terry\"-a frightening night drive Another case with profound implications for the emo- tional understanding of UFO encounters involved two teen- agers whom I will call \"Mark\" and \"Terry.\" Part of a middle class rural family, they were ordinary kids who were about to have an extraordinary evening. They were driving through the countryside some time after sunset, heading home after a day in a nearby city: Mark suddenly pointed out a distant light in the sky. It seemed to just hover there, far ahead of their car. As they watched, it slowly descended toward the highway. Then a turn in the road hid it from their view. When they next saw the object it was huge, and it was close. It seemed to hover just above the treeline to the right of the highway. Both of them were frightened. Terry, who was driving, floored the gas pedal, and they sped off down the highway toward home. As they did, Mark ob- served that the object seemed to be following them, al- ways just over the treeline to their right and slowly de- scending. They were now in a state of near panic as they passed a clearing, which they observed to be brightly lit. Eventu- ally they reached a small town close to their home, and the object was lost to view. A few moments later the two visibly shaken teens pulled into the driveway of their home. I learned of this case from a friend who lived in the region, who had talked with Mark and Terry a few days after their sighting. She had notified our state MUFON team. I then contacted the witnesses and interviewed them. As I investigated, it became apparent that the object resembled a type of small aircraft, but as seen under un- usual conditions. The route which the car had traveled passed near a small airport, which was out of sight of the highway. The object's path, description, and geometry at each stage of the sighting corresponded closely to an air- craft on approach to the landing strip. (Note: As with most UFO sighting cases, one can never say with abso- lute certainty what had occurred, but this was our best hypothesis). In most sighting cases this might have been the end of it. However, one interesting aspect of this case was the fear that the witnesses described as they observed the object. As I interviewed the family, it turned out that their history contained many suggestions of possible close en- counter events. The witnesses and several other family members described events and perceptions similar to those which fill books by Budd Hopkins, David Jacobs, Whitley Strieber, etc. It appeared that this case might be more than just a single \"misidentified airplane\" sighting-per- haps a lot more. One thing that investigators routinely ask sighting wit- nesses is how much they had read or heard about the phenomenon. In this case, the family members had had very little exposure to information about UFO's or close encounters. However, what they had learned was largely from a televangelist, who taught that the UFO phenom- enon was demonic. Could this continuous exposure, both to the phenom- enon itself and to the admonitions that it was evil, have combined to generate a fear scenario in their minds? \"Jim\"-positive on the surface, dark beneath One group of nearly identical experiencer cases can be characterized by the story of someone I will call \"Jim,\" who has had unexplained experiences since childhood. As far back as his memory goes he had been accompa- nied by a friendly little \"cartoon character\" companion. This friend would appear to him at irregular intervals, play- ing, telling him stories, and taking him away on wonderful adventures. Jim often found his little friend to be a wel- come refuge from a challenging world. As Jim grew up, his cartoon companion seemed to dis- appear, to be replaced by other events which left him with a deepening sense of mystery. However, his overall view of his encounters was generally positive. He en- joyed life, and said that he also enjoyed his interaction with the phenomenon. I have noted that sometimes, just as when excess fear is involved, an overly optimistic view of the phenomenon may suggest that all is not as it seems. Jim's experiences were no exception. At several points while describing his \"fun\" experiences to me, he broke into tears-not tears of joy. Could his \"cartoon friend\" have been just one side of a polarity? Was there a darker side to his experiences as well?    .-'.., At Jim's request we began hypnotic sessions. In deep trance he began to examine his \"cartoon friend.\" The first \"crack in the wall\" for him was that his friend had large black eyes. This, along with other factors, seemed to suggest some type of screen memory. He continued on to describe his companion as a small two-legged crea- ture, about four feet tall, with no hair, a big head, and big black eyes, a classic \"small gray.\" His fun and compan- ionship now seemed to have become a classic alien en- counter. As we continued, he recounted a lifetime of abduc- tions, very similar to what Evelyn and many other experiencers have described, and which permeate the UFO literature. His description of them initially had a very dark, frightening tone to it. However, as he contin- ued to describe his encounters-and to examine the world view through which he saw them-Jim increasingly spoke in more objective terms. His polarity of feelings-the joy of his \"companion\" ver- sus the darker tone of his encounters-was steadily chang- ing into an increased understanding and resolution, losing the innocence of his \"cartoon character\" friend, but heal- ing the pain beneath. The phenomenon was increasingly beginning to fit into his life in a more manageable way. Conclusion In these cases-and in many more which fill my files and the files of other researchers-we see that the expe- rience (both positive and negative) of the phenomenon tends to be greatly affected by one's world view. If these factors are extreme in one way or another, they can in- crease the polarity with which the experiencer views an encounter. However, as one better understands one's own perceptual filters this polarity can heal and one can June 2002 MUFON UFO Journal gel?"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"deal with the phenomenon more objectively-on a more level playing field. Is the phenomenon physical, metaphysical, or (para)psychological? I believe that we do not yet know- nor do we understand its motivations. It is not clear whether the intelligence behind it means us good or ill, or if it even has a specific intent. What we do leam from working with experiences is that close encounters can be either positive or negative, or sometimes both-a mixed bag of trauma and growth. Perhaps, rather than simply being good or evil, close en- counters might be subject to a scale that, like the rest of the phenomenon, we do not yet understand. Endnotes: 1.

By Jenny Randies Jenny Randies UFOlogy in disguise? Britain is currently awash with debate concerning the manner with which the MoD (Ministry of Defence) in- vestigated UFOs during the 1950s and 1960s. Our archiac secrecy laws have long ensured that information on this was barely ever conveyed to the public-even via the PRO (Public Record Office) in Kew, London, where official documents available to public scrutiny are to be housed. Only a few scattered docu- ments, such as letters from the public or reports about RAF pilot sightings during a flap that bedeviled a NATO exercise (Operation Mainbrace), have come to light. Indeed the MoD had long argued that they had destroyed all relevant early in- formation about UFOs-such as working party reports and investigations into major cases. Many suspected other- wise, and two men set out to prove it. The two long-term UFO researchers, Andy Roberts and David Clarke, be- gan a project 18 months ago to try to coerce the MoD into releasing their documents. They did this partly by setting themselves up not as UFO buffs, but as \"social historians,\" and citing their record at explaining away many cases-no doiibt as a means to persuade the pow- ers that be that they could be trusted. David also has a doctorate in folklore-plus funding to aid the often lengthy quest for information-and this has worked wonders in getting through to the people that matter. Documents flowed out, including some once denied. And through what is unquestionably a highly skilful in- vestigation, following many leads and clues, they traced others that nobody suspected to exist, finding many ex- MoD and RAF big-wigs willing to tell their story directly to the two UFOlogists (even if they were not now calling themselves UFOlogists!). Andy and Dave then set off to write a book on all of this called Out of the Shadows (Piatkus, London, May 2002). It has created considerable media interest, with a radio documentary aired in April based on their interviews with RAF personnel, and with a Discovery Channel TV documentary in the can set for transmission-not to men- tion the serialisation of their book in Britain's biggest sell- ing daily newspaper, the Daily Mail. Yet in pre-publicity they are characterized as outsid- ers investigating our field, and not as rational insiders who have something pertinent to say. This is no doubt a valu- able PR ploy'so as to ensure that those who normally consider UFO enthusiasts to be crackpots will at least hear what these chaps have to say. But it is proving a little galling for some UK UFOlogists. In my view it is perfectly legitimate to term the re- search that these two UFOlogists have carried out \"so- cial history,\" since it tells the story of how society in Brit- ain during the Cold War era dealt with the problem of UFOs. One might properly call it good marketing. Indeed I must admit that I have toyed with the concept of reinventing UFOlogy in disguise to get away from the bad image that it often has. When Andy, Dave, myself, and several other British UFOlogists launched a net-based UFO forum three years ago we considered junking the name \"UFO\" altogether for this. Rather tongue in cheek I suggested that we tell the public that we were investigating \"scientific anomalies\" and were called \"Scientific Anomaly Network Enquiries\"- or SANE. Someone then pointed out that they did not fancy telling a journalist, who asked what group they be- longed to, \"Actually, I am in Sane,\" although I rather liked the PR possibilities that this might bring! Still, in the end, we reverted to the sedate title UFOIN (UFO Investigators Network), although I suspect it is only a matter of time before some researchers wise up to the advantages of not coming across as UFOlogists, because not doing so offers a means to reach a broader audience. Credit Possibly the success that Andy and Dave have had with this approach is one reason why some resentment seems to be simmering in British UFOlogy. A few other UFOlogists have adopted the same documents (although not, as far as I can see, Andy and Dave's superb list of interviewees that do by far the most to transform these papers into real social history). This information has ap- peared at conferences and in the UFO literature during recent weeks-not always, Roberts and Clarke believe, with proper credit given to their efforts. And, I suspect, they are correct. Something of an acrimonious battle has grown up-fight- ing over who should get the respect due for doing this research. But if there is an award for services to UFOlogy over the past year, then Andy Roberts and Dave Clarke surely deserve to win it hands down on the basis of all that they have added to our knowledge. I must admit, though, to a bit of a wry smile when reading their chapter on the Lakenheath/Bentwaters (1956) case. There is no question that they present a co- gent and extremely detailed account that is packed with new information that they have personally secured. Nor is there any doubt that they have tracked down and inter- viewed many of the key players in this story, making their June 2002 MUFON UFO Journal Page 19"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"record of it easily the most comprehensive and important to ever appear in print. However, it is not always made very, clear how this case was investigated by other mem- bers of the UFO community before them. There are one or two credits I feel are lacking here that do not make the final edit. Let me emphasize that I do riot say this to demean their contribution in any way. Very far from it. They have pursued this case exception- ally well, and rightly quote from their own direct inter- views as primary sources. But the mode of presentation at times shows that the ideal of giving credit where credit is due is not always as straightforward as it may seem. The sad thing is that this ongoing argument about credit will distract attention away from the importance of the information that is being published by them-not to men- tion the huge questions that it poses about official govern- ment handling of UFOs. It is an interesting side debate. But there are far more important issues to arise from this research. When is a skeptic not a skeptic? One of the big arguments raised against these two re- searchers (be they UFOlogists or social historians!) is that they have a debunking style that seeks to reduce cases to misperceptions or hoaxes. They certainly do look for answers-something I can vouch for, having known them.both for many years. And they do not pull any punches in doing so, exposing deception or sloppiness whenever they see it in a manner that you either find refreshing or you detest. In fact your perception may de- pend on whether you have ever been on the end of their wrath (nearly always with good reason I should add). However, what I think is often misunderstood about Andy Roberts and Dave Clarke is that they are skeptics in a pure sense, rather than debunkers. Whilst neither seem convinced that UFOs in any traditional form do ex- ist-if indeed anything beyond misperceptions is involved at all-they are not embittered champions of an effort to destroy UFOlogy. They say-and I believe them-that they would publish (and be delighted to publish) the facts of any case truly seen to be unexplained after investigation. And they have indeed admitted from time to time that cases do still mys- tify them. This is not the hallmark of a debunker. Out of the Shadows Out of the Shadows is sure to be the talk of UFOlogy over summer 2002 (at least in the UK). And rightly so. This is not the place for a book review, but having read a proof copy of the MS I can add some thoughts that may surprise. This is indeed a fascinating account of how and why the British government got interested in UFOs and the mess they often made of the job. But it reveals not a few new cases exposed by the documents and interviews with .prominent figures that these authors have directly uncovered. And some of those cases are ones that the authors freely admit that they cannot explain. I doubt most of their critics were expecting that. This includes what may be the earliest unexplained incident in the UK records, dating from 28 November 1942. It involves the entire crew of an aircraft from Syerston in Lincolnshire that was flying over the Alps. Twice dur- ing a period of 45 minutes they saw an object tailing their plane that was long, tubular and had rows of red lights on the side. What is more, the captain said he had seen a similar object three months earlier. And this one was on the ground as his aircraft passed over Holland near Amsterdam. To the no doubt surprise of many (but not of myself) the authors point out that none of the obvious explana- tions for such an incident (such as a fireball meteor) fit this case. And it is not the only occasion that they demon- strate proper objectivity. This book is packed with good sense analysis of what is often previously untold informa- tion. But to me perhaps the overriding thing that emerges from this unquestionably important work is the conse- quence of it being presented almost as if it is written by outsiders who are analysing the foibles of UFOlogy. I have no doubt that this will suit the needs of Andy, Dave and their book. It will gain them recognition for the impor- tant data that they are publishing that those presenting overtly as UFOlogists would never get. And they will reach an audience that can embrace them as objective outsiders, when much of this audience would probably regard UFOlogists as anything but objec- tive. However, this raises interesting questions for our future as a subject. Should we all, as a community, be willing to masquerade as something other than UFOlogists in order to play the political games unfortunately neces- sary in-this modern world? A degree of respect? Whilst I am not ashamed to call myself a UFOlogist, I do know (and have often seen in action) how someone who calls himself \"Doctor\" (even when that credential is in some .instances rather dubious) gets a credible hearing from the public merely because that appelation creates an impression of sobriety and greater knowledge. Would a scientist who is also a UFOlogist be advised to present himself or herself in public as a scientist who tries to keep an eye on those pesky UFO buffs, rather than as a.UFOlogist who attempts to use science during investigations? And would many of us stand a better chance of being listened to if we presented ourselves as cautious, objective, even skeptical outsiders aware of, and even critical of; the mistakes of those rather silly UFOlogists? It is an issue we may all have to face. Unfortunately, in an age where presentation counts I suspect Roberts and Clarke knew what they were doing here and were not ill advised to minimise their status as UFOlogists and maximise their role as social historians. If it works, as I bet it will, then maybe more of us will have to pay attention to their methods. Of course, this has to be coupled with an ability to do first class research that uncovers masses of new infor- mation and to present your findings in a totally objective manner. There can be no question that Out of the Shad- ows achieves all of that and more in a way few UFO books have ever achieved.

A second focus was on the grossly inaccurate portrayal of the same case by the Amazing Randi in his aptly named book FLIM FLAM. Once again the term pseudoscience has reared its ugly head. The National Science Foun- dation takes polls every so often to measure what the public knows about science and what they believe about the so called paranormal areas like astrology, ufology, telepathy, etc. They found that a lot of people are ignorant of the simplest notions about science with, for example, only 54% knowing that it takes the Earth a year to go around the Sun. They also found that lots of people believe in the paranormal. Their press release seems to suggest that it is because people believe in \"pseudoscience\" that they don't know much real science. They somehow can't seem to provide any evidence to back up this claim. Or at least to present it, if they found it. Gallup Polls and others have consistently found that the greater the education the more likely to accept UFO reality. I would, I think reasonably, expect that the greater the education the more basic science one would know. So where is the beef? Well, as might be expected, Dr. Lawrence M. Krauss (Department of Physics) referred to by his employer, Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Ohio, as the new Carl Sagan, jumped right in with an article in the April 30 New York Times entitled \"Odds Are Stacked When Science Tries to Debate Pseudoscience.\" I had done a debate with Krauss on March 30, 1999, on the Jeff Rense Radio show from the West Coast. Ten days in advance, Jeff had asked if I was willing to debate Krauss, who had written a nasty review of an NBC TV Documentary involving Whitley Strieber. I agreed, ob- tained background info from Case Western Reserve, and read Krauss' books The Physics of Star Trek and Be- yond Star Trek. During the debate it was quite clear that Krauss really hadn't done any homework on either UFOs or advanced nuclear technology, though he had written negative items about both and pretended to be an expert on both. He had also not read Crash at Corona or TOP SECRET/MAJIC or anything else by, or about, me. Since I had worked as a nuclear physicist on fission and fusion rockets and nuclear power plants for space, and have had a very strong interest in UFOs and ad- vanced technology since 1958,1 was able to directly quote and correct the false claims from the books. As one caller put it, Krauss sounded like somebody who was unwilling to look through Galileo's telescope to view the moons of Jupiter. After that show I wrote Krauss, sending along some background material and some papers, and challenging him to a debate at a location and time of his choice. He naturally refused. After all, why should he take on some- body who knows more than he does about these topics? In his new NY Times article, he talks about his battles with creationists and a debate he supposedly had on a Florida radio station about UFOs. I suspect he was really talking about the Rense show. He claimed that debates stack the odds against sci- ence because \"Science is not fair. All ideas are not treated equally. Only those that have satisfied the test of experi- ment or can be tested by experiment have any currency... Beautiful ideas, elegant ideas and even sacrosanct no- tions are not immune from termination by the chilling edge of experimental data.\" This sounds very scientific. But it isn't. Provide me with an experiment using dark energy, or neutron stars, or quasars or black holes. We observers have no control whatsoever over these strange phenomena. We can make measurements and try to interpret them. We can't make an eclipse happen or a major earthquake (we can make small ones). There are scientific approaches that can be taken to find out more about other uncontrollable events, such as automobile accidents, murders, rapes, burglary, or UFO observations. But our entire legal system, often concerned with very significant events such as the above, is prima- rily dependent on testimony from witnesses. Ask a law- yer or a judge. Of course we can measure DNA, and alcohol blood levels, and lengths of skid marks, and bullet trajectories and ballistics. Krauss really goes off the deep end with this gem: \"We may not know how spacecraft of the future will be propelled [certainly true], whether anti-matter drives will be built or even if time travel is possible. But we do know absolutely how much on-board fuel will be needed to speed up a substantial spacecraft to near the speed of light-an enormous amount, probably enough to power all of hu- June 2002 MUFON UFO Journal Page 21"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"man civilization at the present time for perhaps a decade...\" Not a shred of evidence to justify this outlandish claim. Just as when he wrote his books and then debated me, Krauss seems to have no understanding of how very im- portant the selected trip parameters are. In my May 1 letter to the New York Times, I noted that Dr. Simon Newcomb had \"scientifically\" shown that man would only be able to fly with a balloon, two months before the Wright Brother's first flight; that Dr. Bickerton had \"proven\" in the 1920s that there was no way to pro- vide sufficient energy to an object, even using our best explosives, to get it to orbital velocity. I also stressed the \"scientific\" work of Dr. Campbell, who in 1941 \"scientifically\" showed that the required ini- tial launch weight of a chemical rocket able to get a man to the moon and back would be a million million tons. He was only too high by a factor of 300 million! He made just about all possible wrong (dare I say stu- pid?) assumptions, such as assuming a single stage rocket, limited to 1-G acceleration, launched straight up, and hav- ing to be slowed down by a huge retrorocket when com- ing back. Engineers and scientists involved in the space program (as obviously Krauss and Campbell never were) used a multistage rocket, exposed the astronauts to several Gs, launched to the east from near the equator, and used the Moon's gravitational field to pull Apollo in, and the Earth's atmosphere to slow it down upon return. The feasibility is entirely in the details. And all this is not even considering fission and fusion rockets, on both of which I have worked and about which Krauss was almost totally ignorant. Late in 1999,1 sent Krauss a copy of my MUFON 99 paper \"Star Travel? YES!!\" which reviews many of his naive comments. Judging by his latest commentary, he hasn't learned anything since. Of course, I have sent him a copy of my letter to the NY Times and once again chal- lenged him to a debate. The April 30 NYT article and my May 1 response are both posted on my website www.v-j-enterprises.com/ sfpage.html. I would certainly agree that there is a lot of nonsense published about \"paranormal\" subjects. But we don't ex- pect amateurs to be very scientific. We do expect the professional academics to do their homework and NOT to follow the 4 basic rules for debunkers: 1. Don't bother me with the facts; my mind is made up. 2. What the public and the media don't know, I will not tell them. 3. If you can't attack the data, attack the people; it is easier. 4. Do your research by proclamation, rather than in- vestigation. It is much easier. In short, then, what passes for scientific truth from on high is often pseudoscience. New chip implant capable of remote monitoring A device called the VeriChip, similar to a MedicAlert bracelet, has been created by Applied Digital Solutions, a technology development company based in Palm Beach, FL, but instead of being worn on the wrist, it is implanted under the skin. The company calls its chip, which is no larger than a grain of rice, a potential lifesaver for Alzheimer's pa- tients who may get lost, as well as an effective way for doctors to identify patients who will be otherwise unable to identify themselves. A prototype of the chip holds 126 characters and is activated only when a handheld scanner passes over it. The patient's identification number is displayed and then uploaded into another portable device. Patient data is en- crypted to 128 bits and then displayed on the reader. Privacy rights advocates worry that the chip may be crossing a dangerous line, since it could some day be tracked remotely. Newer versions of the VeriChip will hold up to a megabyte of programmable data, and some may include a global positioning tracking feature. And therein lies the problem. Ethicists wonder who will be able to access the data. Can people be monitored? From how far? What about the right to privacy? June 8. Roswell International Museum, Roswell, NM.

Schuessler MUFON International Director The MUFON Business Board Goes To Work For 33 years MUFON has been able to make a differ- ence in UFO research and investigations because of the fantastic volunteer efforts of MUFON members. We are fortunate to have dedicated field investigators, state section directors, assistant state directors, state directors, continental coordinators, provincial directors, national di- rectors, foreign representatives, foreign state directors, functional directors, regional directors, consultants, re- search specialists, journal subscribers, news clipping rep- resentatives, amateur radio experts, associate members, state groups, and headquarters staff. Everyone counts-everyone is important to MUFON's fu- ture. At the July 2001 MUFON board meeting in Irvine, CA, it was decided to establish a \"Business\" board comprised of seven individuals having the goal of meeting often to ad- dress the issues related to run- ning the business of MUFON in these volatile and changing John Schuessler times. These individuals had to have sufficient time, en- ergy and finances to be able participate in this new role- a role that is beyond the basic UFO-related aspects of the organization. Three of the positions were established by the MUFON Bylaws to include the corporate secretary, corporate trea- surer and the international director. The other four posi- tions were defined as at-large positions. The Business Board is comprised of Clifford Clift, B.A. (Greeley. CO), Thomas Deuley, B.S.E.E. (San Antonio, TX), Jan Harzan, B.S. (Newport Beach, CA), John Schuessler, M.S. (Littleton, CO), Robert Simpson, B.S.B.A. (Parker, CO), Thomas Whitmore, B.S. (San Antonio, TX), and Robert M. Wood, Ph.D. (\"Newport Beach, CA). These board members will all be in attendance at the MUFON 2002 International UFO Symposium in Roches- ter, NY, July 5-7. We hope you will come there and meet them and offer them your ideas and support. The first meeting of the board was held at MUFON Headquarters on Saturday, April 27, 2002. Topics cov- ered included: quality and level of success of the MUFON UFO Journal, website, publications, training, annual sym- posium, public education and research; work quality-op- erations, grants and fund raising; memberships/subscrip- tions, staffing, unity in the UFO field, and staying in busi- ness. There was agreement to focus efforts on the Jour- nal and website for immediate action because these arc key to success in all of the areas noted above, especially for feedback to members and public education. In addition, MUFON will endeavor to become more pro-active in UFO-related issues by offering expert help to movie and TV production companies; by working on friendly terms with other legitimate organizations and in- dividuals; developing a new MUFON brochure; pressing for rapid and complete UFO investigations; and striving for unity throughout the UFO field. This is a big task for an all-volunteer organization, but MUFON is ready, willing and able. Grant Supports Outreach Project We are pleased to announce that MUFON has re- ceived a grant from the Zoh M. Hieronimus Fund that will allow us to continue sending the MUFON UFO Jour- nal to all major U.S. news outlets for another year. The project was started in 2001 when MUFON received an initial grant from the Zoh M. Hieronimus Fund for this purpose. Thank you Zoh and Bob. Zoh and Dr. Bob Hieronimus publish The Hieronimus and Co.

George Zeiler Hit by Illness It is with sincere regret that that we must announce that George Zeiler has dropped out of the MUFON 2002 International UFO Symposium speakers' lineup due to serious illness. George was going to present the re- sults of his extensive research into recent, as well as older, government UFO documentation in a talk entitled \"UFOs: A Clear and Present Danger.\" Hopefully, as George recovers, we will be able to publish his material in an- other format. New Field Investigators Kathleen Marden, Director for Field Investigator Training, has announced the following Field Investigator Trainees have completed the Field Investigator's Exam and are now MUFON Field Investigators: Bruce Aus- tin, Redondo Beach, CA., Lin Luck, North Hollywood, CA., and Nancy Ann White, Oregon City, OR. Field Investigator trainees are urged to study the Field Investigator's Manual and take the exam. The exam may be requested from MUFON Headquarters. There is no charge for the exam.
