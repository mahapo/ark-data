Schuessler Farewell to Our Friends.... The UFO field has lost three super proponents-Betty Hill, Dr. John Mack and Astronaut Gordon Cooper. Each of them weathered the attacks of individuals wanting to harm their reputations or impact their jobs. Neverthe- less, they al- ways main- tained a posi- tive attitude, openly shared their informa- tion, and never wavered in their search for John Schuessler truth. I am proud to have known each of them. Even though they have passed on to a better place, they will be fondly re- membered for the time and effort they put into the UFO field. Following her abduction experience along with her husband Barney, Betty Hill spent many years doing television and radio programs, college lecture tours, and writing. Her experience was the subject of John Fuller's book. The Interrupted Journey, and the television movie. \"The UFO Incident.\" Betty was a guest on F. Lee Bailey's LieDetectorTV program, and received a very high rating for truthfulness when she answered \"Yes\" when asked, \"Is it true you were shown a star map while you were on board a UFO in the White Mountains of New Hampshire on Sept. 19,1961?\" Later, she was the author of the book A Common Sense Approach to UFOs. She was a featured speaker at the MUFON 2002 International UFO Symposium in Rochester, NY, where she ended her presentation with the statement, \"I have met astronauts from another planet. In my lifetime, I have seen many miracles.\" Betty also will be remembered by all the folks that she befriended and in some way helped as they were strug- gling with their own UFO experiences.

As he drove, he got closer to the \"fire\" and realized that it was not a fire at all but a series of three reddish or- ange lights affixed to the bottom of a huge triangular object. He neared an intersection and exited his car to watch the metallic craft as it approached from the north and moved directly toward him. He noted his fear and started to run from his car, but re- alized that there was nowhere to go. As the giant object passed overhead, it blocked out all the stars, and he esti- mated the size to be some 300 feet in length. The bottom of the craft was somewhat illuminated from the three flame-like, symmetrical appendages on the bottom, and he described what ap- peared to be \"ribs\" running across the bottom of the obj ect. As it passed directly overhead, something seemed to reverberate through his body. He stated that he felt many sensations all at once, but no de- scription could be found for what he actually felt. He also noted that the ob- ject made a pulsating/drumming-like noise which also passed throughout his body. The object passed him and suddenly turned west, without banking, and moved behind nearby hills. At this time MUFON Tennessee has determined that the possibility exists that this witness may have been injured by this \"CE-2,\" or close encounter, case. He has reported a metallic taste in his mouth, as well as nose bleeds, which may or may not be related to this close encounter. The witness has also reported a loss of time, according to his watch, of some 15 minutes. NOVEMBER 2004 Sketch of the triangular-shaped object by James Neff, based on the de- scription by the witness. Double sightings of lights and triangle reported by Wisconsin family Reported sightings over a two-day period by a Mondovi family on High- way 10 between Mondovi and Durand, WI, which began around 10:15 PM on July 23, 2004, left the observers very frightened. The witnesses, who wish to remain anonymous, were a husband and wife and their two teenage children, ages 13 and 14. Noticing strange red lights in the sky over a field south of the highway, they turned off on a side road to turn around, and at that time witnessed a triangular- shaped craft that was about 300 feet above their car. It was black and gray, with three white lights underneath. It made no sound and was slowly moving at about 5MPH. MUFON UFO JOURNAL \"It was really weird,\" said the mother, who initially joked with her husband that it was a UFO. \"I was afraid to get out... it was low, right over the car.\" They watched it until it disappeared behind the trees. The father wanted a better look at the object, so they drove home to Mondovi so he could get his glasses. On their way back, they could see the object on the north side of the road, but could view it only from the side. It was low enough that the hills, not the sky, provided a backdrop for it. They returned to the field where they had initially seen the strange lights in the sky and drove down another side road, on the south side of Hwy. 10, to get a closer look."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"The lights were flying in strange for- mations, and at one point the lights and objects appeared to be \"on a really fast collision course,\" but stopped in mid- air and reversed their direction of move- ment, according to the mother, who added, \"I know this sounds crazy.\" As the family drove slowly down the road, watching the lights in the sky, they noticed a light directly behind their car and assumed that it was another car wanting to get by, so they pulled into a driveway to let the car go by. But the light also stopped, and seemed to be waiting for them, so they assumed that perhaps the car had actu- ally wanted to turn into the driveway. So they pulled out of the driveway and proceeded to drive down the road to- ward the light. They noticed that it was only one light, not two, so they figured it was a motorcycle, but just as they were about to meet it on the road, it completely vanished before their eyes. The mother said one of the main rea- son they left was this disappearing light that apparently followed them. \"It was like the twilight zone,\" she said. She explained that the three things that seemed so strange were that there was no noise coming from the craft, surprise that the lights and craft didn't crash, and how the light mysteriously disappeared. \"I was hoping that some- one else would see what we saw, and explain it to me.\" The mother said that she is an openminded person, but that she has had no previous interest in UFOs. How- ever, she stressed that \"I absolutely know what I saw.\" The family members kept asking each other what they saw and \"were all freaking out so bad,\" according to the mother. She said she expected more cars would have been on the road to see the lights as well. The following night, July 24, they returned to the road at about 11PM. They slowly drove down the road when suddenly what appeared to be the same light appeared before them. They stopped the car, and the light waited. They turned the car around and drove away from the light, but some- thing seemed to be holding their car back, and they couldn't drive any faster Sketch, based on an eyewitness description, of the apparent UFO seen between Mondavi and'Durand, WI. than 40 MPH. Suddenly, the light be- gan to chase them at a rapid speed. Once they reached Highway 10 and the light was about to overtake them, it suddenly disappeared. The father returned to the road the following day to test his car, and found that he was able to easily accelerate to 70 MPH on the same stretch of road where the night before his car could not move any faster than 40 MPH. Two investigators, Chad Lewis and Terry Fisk, who host a paranormal ra- dio show, say the family is quite cred- ible. The people who lived on that road were not present at the times of the sightings. One of them was working elsewhere, and the other was on vaca- tion. Neither reported ever seeing any strange lights in the area. Both con- firmed that neither had been working in the fields with any field equipment that might have had lights. Visiting the area after dark, the in- vestigators noticed that if the source of the light on the road had been a car, motorcycle, ATV, tractor, or pedestrian with a flashlight, their headlights would have illuminated the area well enough for them to discern the source of the light, Fisk commented. -Thanks to Rich Heiden, the Durand Courier- Wedge, and the Mondovi Her- ald-News. NIDS moving to an \"inactive status\" The National Institute for Discovery Science (NIDS), which has been in- volved with research ranging from im- plants to animal mutilations, has an- nounced that it is essentially closing down-what Director Robert T. Bigelow describes as \"an inactive status.\" He states, \"We have not had the need to do any major investigative work for well over two and a half years. In view of this, we decided to reduce our staff.\" He adds, \"Our administrator, Colm Kelleher, has taken a position outside of Nevada to do cancer research. Colm's ambition has always been to do cancer research, and was employed in this field prior to his employment with NIDS. We are sorry to see him leave. It is unfortunate that there isn't more activity, as there was in the past, that warrants investigation.\" Bigelow says that NIDS will still re- tain secretary/receptionist Mary Allman (702) 798-1700. She will reportedly be talking daily to Bigelow's assistants, Janice and Donna. \"Should substantial activity occur with a need for investigation, then NIDS will be reactivated with new per- sonnel,\" Bigelow concluded.

J. Gevaerd, Edi- tor, Brazilian UFO Magazine & MUFON Na- tional Director, Brazil The 350,000 inhabitants of the Bra- zilian city of Uberaba. State of Minas Gerais, are very uneasy with a sup- posed alien skeleton displayed in a lo- cal museum. The exhibition is at the Museum of Natural History Wilson Estevanovic, a private institution which also hosts the Astronomic Society of Uberaba and shows animals, mummies, and several kinds of stones. Both institutions have the common objective of taking culture and science to the city's schools. The museum be- longs to the Estevanovic family, whose ancestors crossed the world with a cir- cus at the end of the nineteenth cen- tury, hi every place the family has been, they have acquired pieces, such as mummies, animal skeletons, fossils etc. The Estevanovics went to Uberaba in 1956, and in 1997 they founded the museum which today features more than 20.000 pieces. At the end of August, two directors of the institution, attorney Wellington Estevanovic and professor Carlos Magno Estevanovic came to me and tresearcher Jose Eduardo C. Maia re- porting a very unusual piece in their col- lection, and asking us to take a look. It was a strange embalmed skeleton which has been with the family for 96 years. The directors informed me that the carcass has attracted the attention of the local community, and that was the rea- son they decided to show the piece to the Brazilian UFO Magazine, thinking it might be of an extraterrestrial being. They thoroughly examined the skel- eton, together with Wilson Estevanovic Neto, another member of the Estevanovic family. Estevanovic Neto is a researcher of the subject, restorer, gemologist, and also an expert in the processes of mummification. Some doctors contacted by us have NOVEMBER 2004 talked little about the subject, saying only that the bones do not seem to be- long to a human being, due to anoma- lies like a huge head and a small body. What was also surprising to Wellington Estevan, president of the MUFON UFO JOURNAL Editor's Note As the author of this article points out, there is at this point little evi- dence that the strange mummified entity from Brazil is of extraterres- trial origin. However, there is enough strangeness and enough in- terest to suggest that additional in- vestigation may be warranted. The article following this one, by Lloyd Pye, author <& Every thing You Know is Wrong, is an update on an- other strange artifact, the famous \"Starchild\" skull. While this topic is seen as unwor- thy by many mainstream urologists, it appears that Pye is attempting to utilize scientific procedures to deter- mine if the mystery skull is, in fact, not human. Since a number of readers are aware of this effort through Pye's appearances at UFO meetings, in magazine articles, and on the Internet, it is felt that an update is appropriate. Museum of Natural History, is the di- ameter of the head, which is 97 cm. In addition, the semi-mummified carcass seems to have belonged to a hermaph- rodite with six-fingered feet. We estimate that it might be of a 10 to 12-year-old pre-adolescent, based on orthodontic studies. When alive, this being had multiple anomalies. The most evident ones are the presence of hydrocephaly and pal- ate-labial fissure, that is, a primary con- genital malformation. Extraterrestrial creature? According to Estevan, students and other people who have already seen the skeleton at the museum have no doubt it is of an extraterrestrial creature. Some people felt sick at seeing the carcass exposed, while others got scared, but most of the children felt excited. Despite the intense curiosity, there is no further information about the"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"piece. The Estevanovic family does not know where the piece comes from or how it was embalmed, but they believe it occurred more than 200 years ago. The box in which the skeleton was kept was opened in 1997 after the death of Wilson Estevanovic, who revealed to his son, Wellington, the secret it con- tained. Before that, it was only a sealed box, said the director of the institution. Ufologist Maia believes that the ma- terial is very valuable and deserves pro- found studies, saying, \"I haven't seen anything like this before, except in movies or pictures. Now we have a skeleton very different from a human one which we are going to study care- fully.\" According to information from other researchers, Brazil does not have the necessary facilities to perform exami- nations of the carcass to verify if it is human or not, since it is already mum- mified. Brazilian UFO Magazine (www.ufo.com.br) has assembled a team to further examine the skeleton in detail in order to determine its real na- ture. If this is an alien structure, what could be concluded with serious scien- tific research, and shared with other re- searchers? The Estevanovic family has been very helpful, opening all doors of the museum to researchers, since they also want to see the mystery solved. A biological sciences student of the University of Bahia, Veruska Estevanovic, granddaughter of the institution's founder, concluded after studies on the origin of the piece that the skeleton probably belongs to an extraterrestrial being. Among other examinations, the car- cass underwent a morph anatomic evaluation. In her report, Veruska talks about the development of the skeleton in a more detailed description: it has a palate-la- bial fissured skull with a reduced pal- ate and a slender and protuberant cen- tral structure projected through the na- sal cavity and two canine teeth on its distal ends. Anatomic analysis The morph anatomic analysis of the skeleton has indicated that the distance between this structure and the upper maxilla is 5 cm. The nasal cavity pfe- . sents a crack at its base which is inter- rupted by the projection of the palate- buccal structure, she said. The upper maxilla is incomplete, with a central fissure directly linked to the nasal cavity with only nine teeth. The lower maxilla is smaller than nor- mal anatomic patterns, too long and nar- row on its horizontal axis, holding only nine teeth. The eye orbits are shallow, relatively far from one another, presenting an os- sified central structure, which is circu- lar with a central orifice and one ossi- fied optical nerve. Such body structure does not match the human anatomy. The skeleton does not have the auditory pit, as well as the auditory canal. The cranium presents typical cranial cracks, and the front re- gion has two relevant protuberances. The carcass is divided in head, trunk, and limbs without any known propor- tion. The cranium's dimensions are 1 '/2 times the chest. Veruska continues: \"The creature presented a bone characteristic which allows us to define at least two severe congenital abnormalities: hydrocephaly and palate-labial fissure, that is, two syndromes very known in the medical literature. \"The skeleton certainly belonged to an individual with congenital malfor- mation or anomalies, which consist of developmental failures in the occasion of the birth. In the universe of congeni- tal malformation, no classification of an isolate nomenclature is universally accepted-that is, all of them are lim- ited. \"Each one is directed to a specific purpose in the study of the teratology branch of science that studies abnor- mal pre-birth developments with prin- cipal emphasis with respect to already known pathogenesis. \"If human, the causes of congenital malformation in the skeleton might be chromosome abnormalities, mutant genes, environmental factors, multifatorial inheritance, or even a com- bination of genetic and environmental factors combined with other unknown causes.\" -Thanks to Eduardo Rado for trans- lating this article. \"Starchild\" skull testing continues to show anomalies By Lloyd Pye Sixty to seventy years ago an Ameri- can girl of Mexican heritage in her late teens (15 to 18) was taken by her par- ents to visit relatives living in a small rural village 100 miles southwest of Chihuahua, Mexico. The girl was forbidden to enter any of the area's numerous caves and mine tunnels, but like most teenagers, she went exploring. At the back of a mine tunnel she found a complete human skeleton ly- ing on the ground's surface. Beside it, sticking up out of the ground, was a malformed skeletal hand entwined in one of the human skeleton's upper arms. The girl proceeded to scrape the dirt off a shallow grave to reveal a buried skeleton smaller than the human one and also malformed. She did not specify the type or degree of any of the \"mal- formations.\" The girl recovered both skulls and kept them for the remainder of her life. Upon her death they were passed to an American man, who maintained pos- session for five years before passing them to the American couple who now control them. One of the skulls appears to be hu- man, and is assumed to be Amerindian (an Indian from North or South America) because the rear of its cra- nium exhibits the flattening that results from being carried in infancy on a cradle board. The other skull, which is known as the Starchild skull, remains to be iden- tified. The mystery skull The face is missing from the upper bridge of the nose to the foramen mag- num (the hole where the spine enters the skull), but the cranium and most of both eye orbits (the external parts of the sockets) are intact.

For nearly six years the official Starchild website has been www.starchildproject.com. Anyone can read additional details of the early history there, and see what we went through trying to figure out the Starchild, and trying to obtain funding to get scientific testing done on it. Because of our habitual lack of op- erating capital, we remained painfully short of meaningful data. All these drawbacks were primarily my fault. I'm simply a terrible fundraiser-period. Testing Despite my handicap, I did manage to get certain tests done, enough to con- vince me and a small coterie of devoted followers that we were onto something if we could find a way to have sophisti- cated scientific testing done. Finally, in October, 2002, we lucked out and found a patron here in London, Belinda McKenzie, who agreed to fund the badly needed ancient DNA test. That was accomplished last year with a tantalizing result. The Starchild's mitochon- drial DNA was relatively easy to recover, and showed it had a human mother (ex- pected if it is a hybrid), but its nuclear DNA. the part that would reveal its father's genetic heritage, couldn't be recovered with current prim- ers. We were advised to wait for primers to become more efficient. We were also ad- vised to investigate its bone chemistry, because in con- ducting the DNA tests, some intriguing discoveries were made. 1. The bone was signifi- cantly harder to cut that it should have been. 2. There was a stronger- than-usual smell of \"burning bone\" when cutting it. 3. When put into EDTA, the normal solvent for hu- man bone, the Starchild should have dissolved within a week, or perhaps less, since it is less than half as thick as normal human bone. Ten weeks later the Starchild bone had not dissolved a bit. 4. When 'tween 20, a strong deter- gent, was added to the mix, the Starchild bone dissolved completely, overnight, down to a thin layer of resi- due. Unexpected. Thus, its chemistry seems to be un- usual enough to warrant a full-scale investigation. For most of 2004 we have been doing precisely that, and now we have results with scientific merit and investigative significance. A new web site -Because all the new work has been done in England and paid for by a Brit- ish subject, I decided to establish a new, UK-based website to keep up with fu- ture developments regarding the Starchild. The first array of slides we can show you are powerful indeed, clearly indi- cating that we are on the verge of mak- ing history with our endeavor, whether it ends up alien-related or not. Later, I will add other slide arrays that will encapsulate the material avail- able on .the original Starchild Project website. That site was primarily text based, so many people found it tough sledding. This one will be primarily slide based, with an emphasis on being con- cise and compact. This should make it easier to access around the world. We hope you agree. Let us hear from you if you have something meaningful to contribute to our quest, and espe- cially if you or someone you know can contribute financially. And please help us spread the word about what we're doing. We need all the help we can get. Below, you can read a report by Dr. Ted Robinson. Also, you can view the Trace Genetics Official Report on DNA analysis of Starchild Bone. Preliminary analysis of a highly unusual human-like skllll Dr. Ted J. Robinson, M.D., LJVLC.C., ER.C.S (c) The skull in question has a prov- enance that is not verified at present. That situation may change in time, but for now all that can be said with cer- tainty is that the skull is real, is com- prised of calcium hydroxyapatite (the essence of all mammalian bone), its parts are configured \"naturally\" (not cobbled together or in any other way hoaxed), and it presents numerous physical anomalies that do not conform to standard skull norms. The skull remained in my possession in Vancouver, BC, for the better part of one year. I was given complete discre- tion to study it in any way I saw fit. My analysis derives from extensive exami- nation of the skull itself, combined with analysis of X-rays and CAT scans. I have shared these data with col- leagues who have given opinions that will be mentioned in this document as their input becomes relevant. In general, the skull has the basic components of a human skull: i.e., a frontal bone, two sphenoids, two temporals, two parietals, and an occipi- tal. However, these bones have been markedly reconfigured from the \"nor- mal\" shapes and positions such bones usually have. In addition, the bone itself has been NOVEMBER 2004 MUFON UFO JOURNAL"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"The Starchild skull (secondfrom left) compared with normal human skulls. reconstituted to an equally marked de- gree, being somewhat less than half as thick as normal human bone, with a corresponding weight of roughly half normal. The reconfigurations and the recon- stitution are uniform throughout all axes and in all planes of the skull. There is no asymmetrical warping or irregular thinning that is the hallmark of typical human deformity. Highly unusual morphology The morphology of this skull is so highly unusual as to be unique in my forty years of experience as a medical doctor specializing in plastic and recon- structive surgery of the cranium. Because of its uniqueness, I under- took an extensive review of current lit- erature on craniofacial abnormalities, which failed to uncover a single simi- lar example. In short, it seems to be not only unique in my personal experience, but also unique throughout the past history of worldwide study of craniofacial ab- normalities. This is significant. Specialists who examined the skull and associated X-rays and CAT scans were: Dr. Fred Smith, head of Pediatrics, Children's Hospital, New Orleans, LA. Dr. David Hodges, radiologist, Royal Columbian Hospital, New Westminster, B.C. Dr. John Bachynsky, radiologist, New Westminster, B.C. Dr. Ken Poskitt, pediatric neuroradiologist, Vancouver Children's Hospital Dr. Ian Jackson, craniofacial plastic surgeon, Michigan (formerly of Mayo Clinic). Dr. John McNicoll, craniofacial plas- tic surgeon, Seattle, WA. Dr. Mike Kaburda, oral surgeon, New Westminster, B.C. Dr. Tony Townsend, ophthalmolo- gist, Vancouver. Dr. Hugh Parsons, ophthalmologist, Vancouver. Dr. Smith noted that the skull's cra- nial sutures were well knitted at the time of death, indicating an age at least teenaged. He further noted the extensive col- lection of Wormian bones (small bone \"islands\") connecting the lambdoidal suture (between parietals and occipi- tal), indicating maturity beyond child- hood. This was agreed by several other specialists who studied it, so based on these features the likelihood of matu- rity is high. Dr. Bachynsky noted that there is no evidence of erosion of the inner table of the skull. Such erosion would be consistent with a diagnosis of hydro- cephaly, so this condition can safely be ruled out as a cause of the abnormali- ties expressed. Hydrocephaly also causes a widen- ing of the sutures, again not expressed here. There was consensus agreement to both of these observations by other experts conversant with these features. Dr. Kaburda carried out special three-dimensional X-rays which mea- sure certain fixed points in any skull, allowing for comparison of any particu- lar skull to the established norm. Deviations outside the norm These accumulated results were compared to a statistical analysis of 100 human skulls. This skull was found to be more than ten (10) \"standard devia- tions outside the norm, i.e. the statisti- cal center of a Bell curve. This is another strong indication that the skull in question is unlike anything previously seen or investigated. Doctors Townsend and Parsons ex- amined the orbital cavities and con- cluded that the being may well have been sighted, but if so, its visual struc- tures deviated strongly from the norm. The cavities, while astonishingly symmetrical, were less than 50% nor- mal depth. The optic foramen, which carries the optic nerve from the brain through the orbital bone to the eye, is nearly an inch lower than it would be 8 MUFON UFO Journal NOVEMBER 2004"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"in a normal human skull. However, attachment points for the muscles that control an eyeball's move- ments were still to be felt on the inner surface of the orbit, indicating that a bah 1 , rather than some other mechanism, was its most likely expression. If indeed these sockets held eyeballs, those of normal size would have greatly protruded from the face, creating a se- rious liability of damage during routine activity. Because the eyeballs occupy a posi- tion lower in the face than is normal, and they rest in a socket markedly re- duced in rectilinear shape and depth, they would have been significantly re- duced in size. In either case, however, large eye- balls or small, they would require up- per lids three or four times more ex- tensive than normal upper lids to be lubricated in the manner necessary for human eyeballs to function properly. Brain abnormally large Doctors Hodges and Poskitt found the brain inside the skull was abnor- mally large. This was determined by lining the intracranial cavity with a plas- tic bag that was then filled with Niger birdseed. This gave a size of 1600 cubic centimetres, which is 200 c.c. larger than the typical adult size of 1400 c.c. This is even more unusual because the size of the skull compares most favor- ably with a small adult or a child of about 12 years old. This extra brain capacity is appar- ently due to the deep shallowing of the eye sockets, a total lack of frontal si- nuses (not even vestigial bumps are discernable), and significant bossing (expansion) of the upper rear of both parietals. In any case, they observed, the ex- treme slant of the rear parietals and the occipital bone challenges whether this skull could have contained typical brain matter, and casts further doubt that its cerebellum was typical. In a normal skull, the cerebellum rests at the base of the cerebrum, sup- ported by the internal occipital protu- berance and the twin flares of the sag- ittal sulcus and the transverse sulcus. With this support mechanism, over the course of a lifetime the cerebrum's weight does not press down onto the cerebellum and distend it such that it will cease to function properly. In this unique skull, however, the entire weight of the brain slants directly down on the area that should hold its cerebellum. Instead of the rounded area typically present for support, there is a wedge-shaped area of perhaps one- quarter of normal. Furthermore, the internal protuber- ance and sulcus ridges are significantly reduced. What effect would the weight of a notably amplified brain have on an unsupported cerebellum carried into adulthood? It presents a genuine conun- drum. Flattened rear of skull Personally, I was most concerned with determining how the rear of the skull could have become so flattened, from the atypical fossa (depression) in the sagittal suture between the parietals, down to the foramen magnum opening. This could not have been caused by any kind of flattening or binding device, because the surface of the occipital re- veals the subtle convolutions inevita- bly present in unaltered skulls. Skulls that undergo any kind of shap- ing technique will always reveal such technique with a distortion of the bone surface. Lacking even a hint of evidence of shaping, and of any unnatural or pre- mature fusing of any sutures, it is en- tirely safe to say that the extreme flat- tening of the skull was caused by its natural growth pattern, and is not arti- ficial. This too is significant. Another of my concerns is that the external occipital protuberance (inion) is absent from its notable position in the center of the occipital bone, and indeed is represented by an actual slight fossa (depression) in the surface. (As mentioned earlier, the same is true for its internal counterpart, which has been greatly reduced.) It seems clear that the neck of this being attached to its skull much lower than in a normal skull, centered under the balance point for both lateral and medial flexion. Even more unusual, the neck itself seems to have a circumference some- where in the range of 50% of usual neck volume, which presents yet another example of the thorough uniqueness of this specimen. No sign of brow ridges In addition to lacking frontal sinuses, there is no sign of the brow ridges evi- dent in normal skulls. Its upper orbits are thin edged rather than rounded. Its zygomatic arches are greatly reduced and significantly lowered from then- usual positions. Its mastoid processes are less than normal, as are all connective points for the lower face (which would attach to the coronoid process and condylar pro- cess of the missing mandible). Based on these observations, its lower face may have been as much as 50% re- duced from normal. On the other hand, its inner ears are noticeably larger than normal, again pushing into the range of 50% larger. This is also true for the condyles abut- ting the spinal atlas. A detached upper right maxilla con- tains two molars [one has been lost to testing]. Tooth wear on the molars in- dicates maturity was reached, yet an- other set of teeth is present in the max- illa, and appear ready to take the place of those mature teeth when and if they are lost or are no longer useful. The question of age at death remains open. These and other mysteries about this skull await further analysis by other experts wishing to help determine its origin and history.

Event Date/Time: March 25, 2004,18:59 to 19:15 C.S.T. Event Location: Between Des Moines, IA, and Omaha, NE. Background In the early evening hours of March 25, 2004, a Northwest (NW) Airlines Airbus 319 on a flight from Mil- waukee, WI, to Los Angeles, CA, radioed air traffic control in Minne- apolis, MN, and reported two flights of two uni- dentified aircraft (a total of four air- craft). The pilot said that the unidentified aircraft were about 15 miles in front of him and traveling in a westerly direc- tion. (In the same general direction as the airline.) The pilot and crew had the unidenti- fied aircraft in sight for about 15 min- utes until the UFOs grew quite small and were no longer visible. Upon being relieved of his shift, the air traffic controller who directed the flight called the National UFO Report- ing Center (NUFORC) and reported the sighting, referring to the craft as UFOs (see audiotape transmissions on page 11). The air traffic controller who re- ported the sighting was to appear on a radio talk show with Davenport, direc- tor of the NUFORC, but the controller's supervisor did not want him Ffight of NW 999-March 25, 2004 (&53to723PMCST) (Average Ground Speed = 455 MPH) William Puckett .Nebraska ' to appear on the radio show. I first heard of the sighting when Davenport discussed the case on a ra- dio talk show program soon after the event. I subsequently visited the NUFORC web site http:// www.nuforc.org to learn more details. I then immediately submitted a Free- dom of Information Act (FOIA) request to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Great Lakes Region, requesting radar data and an audiotape of the con- versation between Air Traffic Control (ATC) and the NW Airlines flight. I also requested logs for the evening of March 25,2004, from the Air Traf- fic Control Center (ARTCC) in the Minneapolis, MN, area. Results Results of this investigation are pre- sented via the transcript of the actual conversation between ATC and the crew (following page). Due to space limitations only significant communi- cations are included. The flight number of the airline is not mentioned, and hereafter will be re- ferred to as flight number 999. The intent is to protect the identity of the pilot and crew. A radar plot of the path of NW 999 is shown above. Also checked was a plot of anomalous radar returns and the position of the NW flight. (Returns are filtered to reflect only returns at or near the 12 o'clock viewing position from the NW aircraft.) Radar plots are not shown due to space limitations. Significance The significance of this sighting is that trained observers (NW airline crew) saw four objects that they could not explain. FAA acknowledged the explanation, and also stated that other pilots had seen the objects. Radar data does not show the un- known aircraft on a continual track 15 to 20 miles ahead of the NW aircraft, but it does show some primary returns in the 12 o'clock position from the Northwest flight on several of the maps.

Ah O.K. - www November - uniform shows returns in the 12 o'clock posi- tion, but the returns are about 40 miles from the NW flight. The radar map does show returns that could be interpreted to be very fast- moving aircraft that were not transmit- ting transponder information to the ra- dar. One of the potential aircraft was moving at around 4 times the speed of sound and the other at nearly 3 times the speed of sound. If these returns were objects, they would have to have been quite large to be viewed by the crew. \"Fast walkers\" The returns were on the same gen- eral heading of the NW flight and were obviously speeding away. Radar ech- oes that move rapidly are often referred to as \"fast walkers\" by radar operators. This effect can be produced by returns that are off of the scale of the radar scope and do not show up until the next revolution of the radar antenna. This concept is discussed in the ra- dar section of the MUFON Field Investigator's Manual. These fast-moving radar returns could possibly be due to weather, but a check of weather radar shows that rain showers were well into Northwest Iowa at this time, and the radar returns were west of Omaha. Therefore it is unlikely that these returns were due to weather. Dr. James McDonald said in his 1968 report to Congress that a tendency exists to explain too many radar returns as weather, birds, ducting, etc. He fur- ther stated that some returns not iden- tified as known aircraft could represent UFOs. Another point to consider is that UFOs are frequently reported as exhib- iting unusual maneuvers, disappearing, and reappearing. Perhaps this could ex- plain why these craft didn't leave a con- tinuous path of radar echoes ahead of the airline. The information that we have indi- cates that the crew had the craft in sight continuously, but we don't know that for sure. According to the U.S. Naval Obser- vatory sunset at this time and location was at 18:42 C.S.T. and civil twilight ended at 19:09 C.S.T. This means that enough daylight existed to see the ob- jects, but darkness was approaching towards the end of the sighting period. Inquiries were made to NORAD and Strategic Command (STRATCOM) regarding the unidentified aircraft sight- ing on March 25. STRATCOM did not note any un- usual aircraft activity on March 25. NORAD also said that no anomalous aircraft were noted on March 25, but that exercises were conducted over South Dakota and Canada on March 26. On March 27 equipment testing was conducted. NORAD said that the equipment testing was classified. NORAD did say that exercises encom- pass \"scramble-type maneuvers.\" One has to ask the question: Did the sightings on March 25 over Nebraska and Iowa influence the decision of NORAD to conduct these exercises? We do know that the FAA controller contacted NORAD on the evening of the sightings.

Several brief- ings were held after the sighting, but it is not known if these briefings are routine. No simple identification What could these unidentified air- craft be? The weather balloon expla- nation has long been used to explain UFO sightings. A weather balloon was launched from Omaha, NE, at 18:00 C.S.T. This was about an hour before the sighting. The winds aloft at the flight level of 35,000 feet were from WSW at about 50 knots. For this reason the balloon explanation doesn't hold, be- cause if the crew had sighted the bal- loon, it would have been moving to- wards them and ascending. The crew reported that the craft were heading in the same general di- rection (WSW) that they were, and were speeding away from them. The crew also stated that they saw four craft. The crew didn't report any con- trails from the craft. According to the atmospheric temperature profile, con- trails would have formed above about 28,000 feet, but would have rapidly dissipated due to the low humidity conditions (per studies by National Oceanic and Atmospheric Adminis- tration). The NW flight was flying at 35,000 feet and the crew said that the objects were at a higher altitude than they were. However, if the aircraft were conventional, contrails probably should have been briefly seen. A check of astronomical data shows that Mars and Venus were quite bright in the evening sky in late March, 2004. Venus could have be- gun to be visible towards the end of the sighting (sunset was 18:41 C.S.T. and civil twilight began 19:09 C.S.T. at Omaha). Bright stars and planets begin to be visible at the beginning of civil twi- light (source U.S. Naval Observa- tory). Venus was quite bright, with a magnitude of -4.4 (MUFON UFO Journal). Mars was dimmer with a brightness of 2.2. Mercury was also visible. Mars and Venus were positioned in the WNW, and were close together. Mercury was positioned in the WSW at the time of the sighting (close to Mars and Venus). Could the pilots have mistaken bright planetary objects for UFOs? The three planets were close together and posi- tioned in the approximate direction where the pilots saw the objects. Based on astronomical data, it ap- pears that Venus could have been vis- ible towards the end of the time period of the sighting. It is quite doubtful that the other planets would have even been visible during this time, however. Pilots are trained observers, and I think it highly unlikely that they would mistake planets for aircraft. The pilots likely would have flown this same route during the period when the three above planets would have been visible in the above positions and time. Also, the crew said that the objects were moving away from them through- out the time period of the sighting. The planets should have been getting brighter as darkness increased. For the above reasons I doubt that the crew misidentified the planets as flying ob- jects. Conclusion/Filial Remarks In conclusion we have an airline crew who sighted four objects that they couldn't explain. Some evidence also exists that other pilots had sighted the same objects, according to the discus- sion between the controller and the FAA supervisor. A check with NORAD revealed no unexplained aircraft on the date and time of the sighting. However, NORAD related that exercises were conducted on the following day (March 26) over South Dakota and Canada. We learned that these exercises involve \"scramble-type\" maneuvers. Could these exercises be related to the sightings? Also NORAD was con- tacted by the FAA flight controller re- garding the sighting. Why did NORAD say that they were not contacted by anyone regarding any unidentified air- craft sightings? Radar showed some primary returns at the 12 o'clock position from the air- craft, but the returns did not show a continuous path of movement. At 19:11 C.S.T. radar indicated two potentially fast-moving objects about 40 miles ahead of the NW flight. These echoes were hi the 12 o'clock position from the Northwest flight, and were heading in a WSW direction (same general heading as the Northwest flight). However, we don't know for sure if these returns represent aircraft, and the 40-mile distance would mean that the craft would have to be very large to be visible to the crew. Therefore the ra- dar data provides little support to the sighting. The FAA controller said that radar did not detect the craft. Several stud- ies have indicated that UFOs are fre- quently not visible on radar, so the ab- sence of radar visibility in this case does not reduce the validity of the sighting. In summary we can say that reliable observers saw four objects that they couldn't identify, and other pilots also likely sighted the objects. During brief intervals in the duration of the sighting radar showed some returns in the di- rection where the pilots made the sight- ing. Finally, NORAD conducted exer- cises in the general area of the sightings on the next day.

Dr. Mack was one of several speak- ers discussing British officer T.E. Lawrence (\"Lawrence of Arabia\") at the T. E. Lawrence Society Sympo- sium, in Oxford. His 1977 biography of T.E. Lawrence,/! Prince of Our Dis- order, had received the Pulitzer Prize. While returning to the home in which he was staying in North London, trav- eling on foot, he was struck at approxi- mately 11:25 PM by a silver Peugeot 306 while crossing the street. He was rendered unconscious on impact and died a short while later at the hospital. The driver of the Peugeot was arrested at the scene on suspicion of driving with excess alcohol. Dr. Mack and his wife, Sally (Stahl) Mack, divorced in 1995. He leaves a sister, Mary Lee Ingbar of Brookline, MA; three sons, Daniel of Boulder, CO; Kenneth of Almaty, Kazakhstan; and Tony of Cambridge, MA; and two grandchildren. The dominant theme of his life's work has been the exploration of how one's perceptions of the world affect one's relationships. Mack's interest in the spiritual as- pect of human experience has been compared by the New York Timesto that of fellow Harvard alum William James, and, like James, Mack became a con- troversial figure for his efforts to bridge spirituality and psychiatry. This theme embroiled Dr. Mack in controversy in the early 1990s when he began his study of 200 men and women who claimed that recurrent alien en- counter experiences had affected the way they regarded the world, includ- ing a heightened sense of spirituality and environmental concern.

In 1994 the Dean of Harvard Medi- cal School appointed a committee of peers to review Mack's clinical care and clinical investigation of the people who had shared their alien encounters with him (some of their cases were written about in Dr. Mack's 1994 book Abduc- tion-Human Encounters with A liens}. After fourteen months of inquiry, Harvard issued a statement that the dean had \"reaffirmed Dr. Mack's aca- demic freedom to study what he wishes and to state his opinions without im- pediment.\" Mack's explorations later broadened into the general consideration of the merits of an expanded notion of reality. He was the founder of the John E Mack Institute (www.johnemack- institute.org). His second (and final) book on the alien encounter experience, Passport to the Cosmos: Human Transformation and Alien Encounters (1999), was the culmination of his work with the \"experiencers\" of alien encounters, to whom the book is dedicated. Mercury 7 astronaut Gordon Cooper dies Gordon Cooper, one of the original Mercury 7 astronauts and a critic of government coverup of UFOs, died Oct. 4. He was 77. He is survived by his wife, Susan, and two daughters. Cooper left NASA and retired from the Air Force in 1970. He worked in a number of industries, including as vice president for research and development for the EPCOT theme park in Florida. In 1951, Cooper, then a U.S. Air Force fighter pilot stationed in Ger- many, witnessed the speedy overflight of a silver daylight disc UFO. In his book Leap of Faith (2000), Cooper discussed not only his experi- ences with the space program, but also his experiences with UFOs. One of the incidents he discussed oc- curred on May 3,1957, when two en- listed men assigned to film an Askania- camera precision landing system rushed up to him, excited and fright- ened, to report they had just filmed a UFO. The saucer had flown over them, hovered above the ground, extended three landing gear, and set down about 50 yards away. It was metallic silver and shaped like an inverted plate. It made no sound. The cameramen shot photos with 35mm and 4x5 still cameras, as well as motion picture film. Gordon checked with superiors, who told him to process the film, but to make no prints, then send it to Washington. He did view the negatives, which were sharp, before sending the films to Washington, but did not view the movie film. No inquiry was launched, and he heard no more of the incident. In 1985, he told the United Nations, \"I believe that these extraterrestrial ve- hicles and their crews are visiting this planet from other planets, which obvi- ously are a little more technically ad- vanced than we are here on Earth. \"I feel that we need to have a top- level, coordinated program to scientifi- cally collect and analyze data from all over the Earth concerning any type of encounter, and to determine how best to interface with these visitors in a friendly fashion.\" NOVEMBER 2004 MUFON UFO JOURNAL 13"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"Betty Hill, the \"Grandmother of Ufology,\" dies at age 85 Betty Hill, the \"Grandmother of Ufology,\" died Sept. 17 at the age of 85. While she gained fame because of her involvement in the famous 1961 ab- duction incident, it was her wit, friend- liness, and fiesty disposition that en- deared her to her many fans. The 1961 Betty and Barney Hill case was, of course, worthy of the interest that it generated. It was the first thor- oughly researched abduction case, and thus has become a classic in the field ofufology. One of the key elements in the case was the outstanding reputations of the Hills. Betty, the daughter of a mayor, was a graduate of the University of New Hampshire with a B.S. in Social Work, and served as a child welfare worker for the state of New Hampshire. Husband Barney was employed by the U.S. Postal Service. As the forerunner of modern abduc- tion cases, the Hill encounter featured elements that over the years have come to be recognized as common elements of an abduction: missing time, physi- cal evidence, physiological evidence, animal reactions, physical examination by entities, and recall through hypnotic regression. The incident was investigated for the National Investigations Committeeon Aerial Phenomena (NICAP) by Walter Webb, one of the top investigators over the past 50 years. Although the case was unique and controversial, since the abduction phe- nomenon had not yet become accepted, Webb wrote a positive report on the incident, convinced of the honesty and credibility of Betty and Barney. Adding to the credibility of the ini- tial report was the later hypnotic work by Dr. Benjamin Simon, a top psychia- trist in the Boston area, who was not convinced that UFOs are real, but was convinced that Betty and Barney were telling the truth as they saw it. Also important is the \"star map\" drawn by Betty following the encoun- ter. This was converted into a compel- ling 3-D model by Marjorie Fish. Betty Hill's 85th birthday party. Initially shunning publicity, the Hills eventually became the subjects of nu- merous media interviews, a book (The Interrupted Journey 'by John Fuller), and even a movie (\"The UFO Inci- dent\"). When Barney died in 1976, Betty thought interest in their encounter would die with him, but this did not occur. Betty continued to be in demand as a speaker and consultant, finally an- nouncing in 1991 that she was \"retir- ing\" from ufology at the age of 72. However, there were still many in- dividuals who wanted to meet with her, and she welcomed them into her New Hampshire home, often showing them the dress that had become stained dur- ing her on-board encounter with the entities. Sometimes she would set up her 35mm slide projector for visitors and, often with a cat in in her lap, show slides of some of the many UFOs that she had photographed over the years. In 2002 Betty was a featured pre- senter at the MUFON International Symposium in Rochester, NY, speak- ing on \"Miracles,\" and the 2002 Sym- posium Proceedings was dedicated to this First Lady of Ufology.

The first time I met Dr. John Mack was in a hotel room along with Walter H. Andrus, Jr. after a long day at a UFO symposium. John was friendly, gentle, and unas- suming as he talked with us for hours about what he was trying to achieve and how he could work with MUFON. Ultimately, he became MUFON's Di- rector-at-Large in Psychiatry. As a Pulitzer Prize-winning author, he was the author or co-author of at least 10 books and more than 150 schol- arly articles. His last MUFON sym- posium presentation was in Orange County, CA, in 2001 where his presen- tation was Witnessing: Abductees as Sacred Truth-Tellers. He told how he had worked inten- sively with hundreds of individuals from many walks of life in several cul- tures who reported profound, life- changing experiences through encoun- ters with human-like beings, reaching them apparently from other dimensions. His audience was spellbound and gave him a standing ovation at the end of his presentation. Even though he was a busy man, John contacted me several months be- fore his passing to offer to write a letter on behalf of MUFON to help seek re- search funding for the organization. He was a nice person and a friend to us all. I will miss him. While working in the U.S. Space Program, I met a lot of astronauts. They were all impressive-having the knowl- edge, skills, and daring to go into space in fragile manmade craft. Astronaut Gordon Cooper had all this and more.

Reviewed by Timothy Good \"Obviously, the term 'best case' is somewhat subjective,\" Connelly sensi- bly points out in his preface to The World's Best UFO Cases, selected mostly from the MUFON UFO Journal. \"The cases in this book are in- cluded because I think they are the best . . . others would add some cases and possibly eliminate others.\" An important reason for Connelly's choice of cases owes to his conviction that \"The credibility of the witnesses and the investigator is, in fact, the key to any case, and the investigators in- cluded in this book are among the world's best.\" Quite so. My main criticism of this otherwise carefully conceived volume is the pau- city of foreign cases. The large majority are American, with only four foreign: two from Aus- tralia; the Papua, New Guinea, case; Nancy Talbott's witnessing of a crop circle being formed in Hoeven, Hol- land; and passing references to a few related cases in other countries. Thus the title is somewhat of a mis- nomer. How about China and the former USSR-with the largest popu- lations in the world-or Canada, Europe in general, and continental South America? I would have liked a CEIV case not involving abduction to have been in- cluded. Connelly argues that \"convincing evidence is elusive, since contactee claims tend to be of the single-witness variety,\" though he accepts that \"some sort of alien-to-abdiictee contact is an accepted element in many of the cases that are considered valid on the basis of other evidence, as in the Pascagoula case.\" He could have pointed out that most abduction claims also involve single witnesses. But this admittedly is a gray area, since there have been occasions when witnesses have been abducted/kid- napped by aliens and communications have been established, with no evidence of missing time (e.g. in the Antonio Villas Boas case). But for the benefit of newcomers es- pecially, I think we should make the distinction that there have been many reported encounters with aliens involv- ing neither abduction nor missing time. In the section on animal abductions/ mutilations, I was surprised at the lack of any reference to the pioneering work of Dr. John Altshuler, a hematologist who first examined the carcass of a mutilated animal (the horse \"Lady,\" in Alamosa, CO, in 1967), and whose ex- tensive medical research, based on the analysis of numerous tissue samples, led to some important discoveries, in- corporated by Linda Howe in her book and documentary, A Strange Han'est. Dr. Altshuler, who died in January this year, led a distinguished career, his posts including fellowship of the Insti- tute for Dermatopathology at the Jefferson Medical School in Philadel- phia, considered to be one of the most prestigious and competitive in medi- cine. The book is illustrated throughout. Photographic reproduction leaves much to be desired in some cases, which doesn't help us assess the validity of the claims made for the Ramey Roswell message, for example. Clearer, com- puter-enhanced images should have been used. There is a comprehensive index and list of recommended reading. To the latter I would have added Unconven- tional Flying Objects by Paul Hill- surely one of the best introductory books, especially for the scientifically- minded-and at least several of the books by Jacques Vallee, John Keel, and-dare I mention?-myself. Criticisms aside, it's no mean feat to tackle a work such as this, especially given the multi-disciplinary, multi-fac- eted nature of the subject. And in general, Connelly has done a fine job editing his selection of signifi- cant cases. This is an essential refer- ence book for both aspiring and sea- soned investigators.

The author moved to the Hopkinsville area as a youngster about a year after the encounter, and initially learned of it from neighborhood children.

New Jersey flying triangle BRICK - The witness reports trav- eling north on Old Hooper Road on Sept. 16, 2004, about 9:15 PM, and looking to the west and seeing what he thought was a tower. He kept watching for a few miles and did notice move- ment, and noticed another car stop on the side of the road to look. He also found a place to stop and watch. What appeared to be some sort of craft started to move very slowly, then started to speed up and fly toward the witness. He states, \"The craft flew overhead with a strange light pattern I had never seen before. I watch the skies at night, so I know the aircraft that go to New- ark, NYC, or Philly airports. \"I looked closely at the craft, and it was clearly a black flying triangle. I quickly turned off the car's engine, and I could hear a low hum that was differ- ent from any other aircraft I have heard. \"I should have paid more attention to the light pattern and copied it down. It is difficult to judge the size and height. Normally, I can do this; however, this thing was difficult to judge. It was pos- sibly from McGuire Air Force base.\" Note: Me Guire Air Force Base has started receiving the new C-17 airlift aircraft that looks and sounds different than the newly-retired C-141. How- ever, its four jet engines are louder than a hum.

A few seconds later it flew back, then stopped for a few minutes. I could see the lights as it spun, then it darted off, leaving a red trail behind it.\" Thanks to Peter Davenport. \"Sunlight lamp\" in Pennsylvania LEBANON - Jed sent the follow- ing email: \"Living close to a military training facility [the GAP] in Pennsyl- vania for years, I have observed many military flares that turn different colors and drop while turning other colors. \"On the night of Sept. 23, 2004,1 saw something that wasn't a flare. I was driving home eastward from the vet after a dog emergency at 3:45 A.M. In the eastern sky between Orion's belt and Sinus I saw an orange-yellow light much like a modern dusk to dawn 'sun- light' lamp. \"The road I was traveling was a ba- sic back road with many turns and twists, so I know it wasn't a reflection. It moved to the right, then left faster than anything I've ever seen, then back to its original location, then dropped downward at what looked like the same distance of the right-to-left movements, then stayed stationary. \"The size of the light was larger than any planet or star, say 3 to 5 times greater than the diameter of Sirius. I continued to follow the object as it be- came difficult to keep in sight upon entering the city. I found the fastest road back to the east and re-sighted the light that was slowly heading to the east- southeast. \"The light was now traveling at a fast steady speed, which would be consid- ered 'normal' to a jet plane at say 30,000 feet.\" Thanks to Jed. South Carolina lights MYRTLE BEACH - The witness reports, \"It was dark and cloudy on the beach on Sept. 16, 2004, at 8:15 PM. All of a sudden I noticed three blinking lights in the sky staying still, then all of a sudden they started moving out to sea. One of the blinking lights moved over to another, then back to its original po- sition. \"If you were to draw straight lines to each, they would have formed a right triangle. After they were out of view- ing distance, another single blinking light came across the sky. \"Three times this UFO let off a light that lasted about five seconds, and it was an orange-reddish glow that only shot upwards. That was it, but I remem- ber during all of this it was cloudy with no stars visible.\" Thanks to Peter Dav- enport. Ohio cigar and flying triangles CANTON - \"It was Sept. 19,2004, at 4:35 PM, a clear, very sunny, beau- tiful day,\" the witness reports. \"I was walking from the garage to the house and looked up and noticed a bright sil- ver or aluminum-colored cigar-shaped or blimp-shaped object in about a 45- degree angle going really fast across the sky from the N.E. to the S.W. for ap- proximately 10 to 15 seconds. \"The sun was really shining on the object, and that caught my eye. I was home by myself, and there were none of my neighbors outside at that time. It was something I have never seen be- fore. It was not a plane. It went really fast, made no trail, and made no sound.\" Thanks to Peter Davenport. Glowing disc in Ohio COLUMBUS - A glowing disc UFO was reported in Columbus on Sept. 20, 2004, at 7:30 PM, that \"be- gan traveling backwards nearly in- 16 MUFON UFO Journal NOVEMBER 2004"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"stantly,\" according to the witness. \"I cannot confirm exactly what it is that I saw. It was flat, however, with no limbs of any sort such as wings found on an airplane. I could slightly tell the shape was reminiscent of a disc or saucer. \"It began its journey in the near prox- imity of the moon. As it neared larger cloud formations I could at times see that it was going behind them. The only clouds present in the sky are the high cirrus clouds, yet, like I said earlier, I could roughly discern a shape. \"As it came from behind a cloud, it had lost its glow, and then its shape was much more clearly prominent. It was then a dull metallic hue. Moments later it vanished from sight. \"Its descent across a quarter of the sky had taken no more than two min- utes. Keep in mind that this was not traveling away from me. It kept its size and girth throughout, and seemed to be traveling in an arc or semicircle around my location. \"I frantically searched the dusk sky for the object, but I could no longer see it. I was resigned to thinking I had hal- lucinated, walking away defeated, but all the while fighting the urge to run into a nearby restaurant and shout, 'Did you see the UFO?' \"A quick glance caught me off guard as I realized that the object was back in the sky and glowing, but it was sud- denly traveling in the opposite direc- tion. A plane cannot suddenly begin traveling the exact opposite direction in mid flight. I really did see a UFO tonight.\" A triangle in Ohio BROOKPARK - The witness re- ports, \"Driving home from work on 480 West at approximately 11:45 PM on Sept. 22, 2004, I was talking on the phone and looked up at a bright light that caught my attention. I was driving west just passing Ridge Rd. and saw the triangle in a banking maneuver. \"It was quite clearly back dropped against the sky, and I saw the very bright lights at each point with a subdued somewhat pulsating red light in the cen- ter. \"It was straight ahead, and only a couple of miles up. I was too fixated on the craft to notice whether anybody else was also observing it. It banked to the south and traveled at a relatively slow rate, while I was able to keep watching it out the window. \"I could make out the low, thin pro- file and the lighting beneath it. As I was still viewing it, I passed a tree line at the same elevation obscuring the view, and as I cleared the tree line, it was no longer visible. \"I have seen the triangle type before in the late 80s on my way home to Con- necticut, where it was amazingly low over the highway traveling at an ex- ceedingly slow speed. \"The entire highway was apparently watching it as well, as we were creep- ing along and there was no place to pull over because of the people stopped on the side of the highway. \"Last night's sighting wasn't quite as dramatic, but having been in the Ma- rine Corps, there was no mistaking it for a conventional aircraft or other natu- ral phenomenon.\" Thanks to Peter Dav- enport. Intense red lights in Ohio WOOSTER/MANSFIELD - At 7:30 PM, on Sept. 28, 2004, the wit- ness was driving due west toward Mansfield on US route 30, and noticed an intense red light ahead at an altitude of about 3,000 feet. The light disap- peared behind a cloud, and never reap- peared. A few seconds later, another intense red light appeared right behind the first one, and disappeared behind the same cloud. A few seconds later, another in- tense light, but this one farther north, and farther away, appeared for a few seconds, and disappeared. A few seconds later, almost directly overhead, another intense red light ap- peared, motionless, for a few seconds, then disappeared. These lights continued to appear and disappear for 3 to 5 minutes, randomly, all over the sky. The witness reports, \"I lost count of them after ten, and they made no noise, and only a couple of them appeared to move. There was a jet airliner flying southwest in the vicinity, so I was able to get some perspective of altitude, speed, and color.\" Thanks to Peter Dav- enport. Illinois \"object\" on digital image CHICAGO - The reporting witness states, \"The witness arrived in the city on Sept. 18, 2004, at 6:31 AM, just after daybreak, and was standing in front of our shop and noticed strange looking clouds. Both of us stared at the same place in the sky for a minute and commented to each other that it was a strange feeling about that one particu- lar spot that kept making us glance up to that point in the sky. \"I joked that there was probably a UFO up there that we couldn't see with our eyes, but could more or less sense. I got our camera and snapped a couple of pictures of the cloud bank, and sure enough when I downloaded them to the computer something showed up. \"There seemed to be a presence up there getting our attention. The object was not visible to the naked eye, but showed up on the image.\" Thanks to Peter Davenport. Texas triangle hovers over school AUSTIN - Around Sept. 18, 2004, for two nights an amateur astronomer noticed lights above his house that didn't belong there. When he focused his binoculars on them, he estimated their altitude at about 500-1,000 feet. The object was not obviously solid, and appeared nearly the same color as the sky. As it flew overhead it had the shape of a \"dim\" triangle with a light at each point and one light in the center. It was slightly darker, but remained a close match to the sky color. The craft hovered over Bedichek Middle School at William Cannon and South First for at least five minutes. \"Then it accelerated to 500 MPH or faster and flew off without changing altitude,\" says the witness. \"It was ob- servable for another 5 to 6 seconds, as it came directly over my house towards the west. When it flew over, there was absolutely no sound, but strangely the air became thick and humid, and there was a barely detectable 'electrical' smell.\" Thanks to Peter Davenport.

It was flying at about the same speed as the airliners, but was much larger than the airliners. \"I was trying to understand what I was seeing when three jet fighters banked over Grand Junction, but were not in any kind of formation. \"One of the fighters that banked over Grand Junction got on a straight course towards the huge object and hit his af- ter burners, flying west. The other fight- ers did not follow. I watched this pur- suit, and the huge object just faded out closer to Green River, UT. \"I kept watching the horizon after the huge object disappeared and saw a much smaller object hovering in the same spot. I thought this was a star, but then another fighter flew over Grand Junction heading directly for this ob- ject and the object disappeared. All this took place in 15 minutes.\" Thanks to Peter Davenport. Washington dose-up triangle SEATTLE - Gary Val Tenuta writes, \"In November,. 1993, on a Sunday night about 9:30 PM I was driving next to the main Boeing Aircraft facility north- bound, and noticed three unblinking red lights low in the sky. They were mov- ing in unison, very slowly across my field of vision from east to west. \"In all that time I'd seen plenty of airplanes and helicopters flying low in this area. Then, only about two blocks away from being directly under the flight path of these lights, I still could not make out what they were attached to. \"However, from their slow, steady movement, in unison, I was pretty sure all three of them were attached to a single object. They were about to enter the airspace above Boeing Field to my immediate left. At this point I was con- vinced it was a single, low-flying craft of some kind, and I knew there was something very odd here. \"I pulled my car off to the side of the road and rolled down the window to get a better look. But the craft was now directly overhead, so I had to get out of the car to see it: \"I opened the car door and stepped out as the craft passed slowly and di- rectly over my head at an estimated al- titude of less than 500 feet-and perhaps only 150 feet above me. I could see it was a gigantic black triangle. \"It was just one big, three-sided, cookie-cutter, straight-edged, black geometric shape-a triangle with one large, round unblinking red light at each of its three corners, flat up against the underside of the craft. \"I could clearly see a huge dense black silhouette against this gray cloud cover ceiling. It flew past me and was now over Boeing Field about seventy- five to a hundred feet above one of the main Boeing hangars, flying at five miles per hour, heading west. \"It appeared to be about the size of a football field. The object didn't make a sound! Not even a hum, a rumble, or anything. It had just passed a few miles to the east directly over hundreds of cars on the freeway. \"I watched it until I couldn't see it anymore. All the way home I just kept asking myself, 'What the hell was that?' I'm still wondering. That weekend, I told my ex-wife about it. She is a cock- tail waitress and has conversations with customers. \"She was told by a Boeing employee that there is an underground manufac- turing facility where they build a huge triangular craft. Boeing made big news in 2002 when a story hit the press that they were experimenting with anti- gravity propulsion. \"So just what did I see? Was it an alien craft or a secret military craft? I don't know.\" Washington triangular lights LAKE WASHINGTON - The ob- server pulled up in front of his home in Leschi on Sept. 18,2004, at 7:45 PM, and saw unusual lights over the 1-90 floating bridge near Seattle. He got out his binoculars and ob- served the craft as it headed north over Lake Washington, finally disappearing behind some trees. The lights were in a triangular configuration, which swooped down from above and then turned north. The observer said, \"With the binoculars, I was able to discern a dark triangular shape which was com- pletely silent, flying low and slow at maybe 500 feet at about 50 knots. I have never seen anything like this: \"There are always a lot of planes fly- ing west over our house and then turn- ing south to land at Boeing Field, but these planes are much higher and you can always hear the jet noise. \"As this unknown craft got farther up the lake, I was observing the tail of the craft, and noticed flashing white, red, and yellow lights somewhat like 'disco' lights. I estimate that this craft was about the size of a 737.\" Thanks to Peter Davenport. Tennessee acorn-shaped object WASHINGTON COUNTY - A re- tired algebra professor who was driv- ing home on Sept. 20, 2004, along Highway 11 around 9 PM saw a large acorn-shaped object moving low in the sky over Buffalo Mountain. The discernible shape was made by noting the arrangement of lights on the object, which he stated were quite like a \"marquis.\" The object was flying in ever tightening circles. The lights were flashing in random, exhibiting more than five different col- ors that reminded him of a Christmas tree. He pulled his car over and watched the bizarre object rise, fall, and finally move up and behind the mountain out of view. This witness states that in 1966, he and his late wife, along with hundreds of Johnson City citizens, witnessed \"a gigantic black disc-shaped object block out all the stars in the sky on a summer night. He also remembered that the gi- ant disc had multiple arrangements of lights on the bottom which flashed se- quentially. The Johnson City Press did a full page story on the sighting. Texas disc EULESS - The observers, a hus- band and wife, were driving eastbound on Highway 183 on Sept. 8, 2004, when he saw a white disc-shaped ob- ject flying at 2,000 to 3,000 feet.south of the freeway.

Friedman The History Channel I wasn't able to watch the History Channel TV Program on MJ-12 and Roswell when it was first broadcast on Oct. 10 because the Channel is not shown in Canada. However, someone taped it for me, and I have had a chance to review it. Fortunately it was much less anti- Roswell than two previous Roswell shows they had broadcast. One was so bad I wrote a strong letter, which is on my website www.stanfriedman.com. I was interviewed for many hours in Chicago many months ago by Tower Productions, and answered many sub- sequent questions by phone. I can't complain about airtime. Other prominent interviewees were Dr. Robert M. Wood and his son Ryan, Dr. Mark Rodeghier of CUFOS, Rich- ard Dolan, author of two books on the National Security State, and the late congressman Steven Sniff. Appearing for the debunker commu- nity were the usual suspects, Dr. Joe Nickell and Dr. Paul Kurtz of CSICOP, and USAF Col. Richard Weaver, whose specialty had been disinfor- mation, and who put together the mas- sive volume \"The Roswell Report: Truth versus Fiction in the New Mexico Desert.\" He provided the fiction. This is the report which claims that there was no saucer crash, but that a very highly classified Project Mogul Balloon was the culprit. The claims are easily refuted, includ- ing such details as the original stories of July 8,1947, all indicating the wreck- age was found \"Last week.\" Weaver says it was a super secret Mogul balloon train found by rancher Mac Brazel in Mid-June, which is hardly last week from July 8. Furthermore, Weaver's report also claimed that Counterintelligence Of- ficer Sheridan W. Cavitt suddenly re- called that the wreckage was just a bal- loon covering an area 20' square and Stan Friedman easily fitting in one vehicle. If that had been all there was, then rancher Brazel would have brought it in to Roswell in his old pickup, and there would have been no reason for Jesse Marcel and Cavitt to follow the rancher down the long dusty trail to the ranch. Mogul had 20-24 standard neo- prene weather balloons tied together at 20' intervals along with Sono- buoys, radio gear, radar re- flectors etc. Even the cover-up story on July 9 said the wreckage covered an area 200 yards in diameter. Major Jesse Marcel, the intelligence officer of the 509 th , told me in 1978 that the debris covered an area more than 1/2 mile long and hun- dreds of yards wide. Strange inaccuracies There were some strange inaccura- cies in the documentary. For example, all Mogul balloons launched before July 8 employed standard small neoprene balloons a few feet in diameter. The program wrongly showed-as have many others-a single huge polyethyl- ene balloon. Much more impressive looking, but not correct. There were a lot of waste visuals showing documents that couldn't be read. One surprise to me was the use of a clip from the Nightline Program of June 24, 1987, featuring a sort of de- bate between Phil Klass and myself. Another surprise was mention of a letter from Donald Menzel's daughter apparently rejecting the idea of his in- volvement in M J-12. When I visited with Mrs. Menzel in 1986 (during my visit to the Harvard Archives where I found many surprises about his involvement in highly classi- fied work for the NSA, CIA, Naval Intelligence, etc), she indicated she knew nothing about his classified work. Why would his daughter be sur- prised that some of her father's activi- ties had been kept secret? An 8-page appreciation of Menzel in Sky ana'Tele- scope 'also said nothing about these ac- tivities. They showed me poring over docu- ments on a table, but Nickell and Kurtz using cameras and apparently (not re- ally) doing scientific work on the MJ- 12 documents. The National Archives and other Archives were made to look as though they were open stack facilities in which researchers could bring briefcases and other items and easily slip things into boxes. In fact they are not. One requests certain boxes from a listing. These archival boxes are brought into the research area from the closed storage vaults. They made it sound as though Jaime Shandera and Bill Moore went to Washington, DC, in July, 1985, seek- ing Box 189 where the Cutler Twining memo was found. This is nonsense. There had been a puzzling postcard received from FOB 189, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, mailed from New Zealand. There are many boxes labeled 189 in the Archives. It was only after the Cutler Twining Memo (whose brief but important men- tion of NSC MJ-12 Special Studies Project wasn't actually shown) was dis- covered that they realized it was in Box 189 of Entry 267 of Record Group 341. Bill and Jaime were looking at the boxes of Entry 267 because I had been informed during a visit to Washington in March, 1985, that it was being clas- sification reviewed. It consists of 42 feet of material, and is titled \"Correspondence and Other NOVEMBER 2004 MUFON UFO JOURNAL 19"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"Documents Relating to Intelligence Activities Overseas and in the Conti- nental USA 1945-54.\" RG 341 (USAF HQ files) had 9,787 feet of material in a total of 480 En- tries. This is about 1,000 four-drawer filing cabinets. The debunkers pronounced distress over the fact that none of the documents were originals. In actuality, the Cutler Twining memo is an original carbon that cannot be removed from the Ar- chives. Anybody can look at it there and see the watermark, the special slant red pencil mark through it, the aged paper, etc. I wish I had originals of the others, too, but one makes do with what one has. No mention was made on the pro- gram that Phil Klass paid me $1,000. for disproving his claim that the NSC used only elite type, by providing more than ten documents using the same size and style pica type used in the CT memo. A copy of his check is in my \"Final Report on Operation Majestic 12.\" A big deal was made of the fact that Cutler was out of the country on the date of the CTM.This is very old news. I am sure that I had pointed out to Tower Productions that this was espe- cially important because there is no sig- nature and no /s/ meaning original signed by. I had also noted that we have copies of memos from Cutler to James Lay, the executive secretary of the NSC, tell- ing him to \"keep thing moving out of my in-basket while I am gone,\" and also of a memo from Lay to Cutler while Cutler was overseas indicating that he was doing exactly that. Also there was no mention of the fact that Lay had met with Ike earlier that day (July 14,1954) and had a brief phone conversation with him around 4:30; or that George Elsey, who worked for Truman all the time he was in the White House, had told me that Lay and Cutler sat next to each other at NSC meetings, and that of course Lay would have sent a memo in Cutler's name to Twining about a simple change of tim- ing for the MJ-12 briefing. The weakness of the debunkers anti MJ-12 arguments was shown by the focus on three specific very weak com- plaints: 1. The date format: Nickell has for years made a big deal that the cover of the Eisenhower Briefing Document shows the date 18 September, 1952. He has claimed that this style (because of the comma placement) violates the gov- ernment style manual! At the archives one finds many dif- ferent date formats, especially in lim- ited distribution, highly classified docu- ments done before word processing was the norm. In one file folder I found 6 date formats. In my Final Report I included 3 memos from the Director of Central Intelligence to Andrew Goodpaster, Ike's staff Secretary, done within a 2- week period and each with a different date format. I also found the same \"anomalous\" date format on items from Roscoe J. Hillenkoetter and Walter B. Smith, both MJ-12 members and past directors of the CIA. Reality is different from an armchair. 2. It was claimed that the Truman Forrestal Memo was listed as Execu- tive Order 092447, but that \"all\" Truman's genuine Executive Orders use numbers between 8000 and 9000. Some serious omissions here are that the TFM is listed as Special Classified Executive Order (It was TOP SE- CRET), not just Executive Order; that the public list doesn't include classified Executive Orders; and that the 092447 is obviously the date, September 24, 1947. I have published items from the State Department in which the date (in this same format) was part of the file num- ber. 3. Someone was shown cutting out a Truman signature and doing a cut and paste job for the TFM. I long ago pointed out that probably the only copy of the TFM with a signature would have been Forrestal's. He had died in May, 1949. DCI W.B. Smith, who did many briefings for Dee during WW 2, and four in late 1952 about national security matters, would have been consulted by briefing officer Hillenkoetter. The CIA certainly could have added a signature to Van Bush's copy or his own, since they both are noted in the memo. The CIA, unfortunately, would pro- vide nothing, even on appeal, about the 1952 security briefings, even though I provided dates and times of two of them.There are many other objections to the legitimacy of the first three MJ- 12 documents which I have demob'shed in detail in my April, 2004, paper \"Ma- jestic 12 Documents Update\" which is on my website. Nickell, at the end of the program, claims that it is really a shame that some people might believe these phony (\"Riddled with errors\") documents are real and become distrustful of the gov- ernment and think less of certain people because of their involvement. How naive can one get? I suspect many people have become very dis- trustful of their government since find- ing out about Watergate and the absence of claimed Weapons of Mass Destruc- tion in Iraq, the absence of a claimed link between Sadaam Hussein and Osama Ben Laden and 9/11, etc. This is as silly as his explanation for the Sept. 12,1952, Flatwoods Monster UFO case as a 6' owl! I have noted this in the Epilogue for the new hardcover book The Braxton County Monster: The Cover up of the Flatwoods Mon- ster Revealed\\sy Frank Feschino, Jr. I did the fore ward as well. Copies are available from me at POB 958, Houlton, ME 04730-0958, $33.45, in- cluding S and H. [To be reviewed in the Journalin the December issue.] There is also a new video, \"Do You Believe in MAJIC?,\" shown on the Ca- nadian Space TV Channel in June, which offers comments from much less biased and more informed investiga- tors. A good part of it is a sort of point- counterpoint discussion between my- self and Karl Pflock. It is only $20.00. It was also suggested in the show that Moore, Shandera, or my serf could have forged the documents. Evidence pro- vided? ZERO. One of the prime rules for debunk- ers is if you can't attack the data, at- tack the people.

Pondering the many things that he brought to our sub- ject caused me to ask myself whether we see our role as active researchers in too narrow a focus. That is certainly something that cannot be said of Jenny Randies Dr. Mack. Of course, there are many ways in which an individual can contribute to UFOlogy. We may consider ourselves to be an investigator-following up sightings and trying to define the evi- dence from which truth will be dis- cerned. Or we may adopt a wider brushstroke and seek to piece the clues together via historical documents, di- rect observation, or instruments detect- ing spontaneous phenomena. These seek to provide some grand strategy to figure out what is really going on. Soul searching However, UFOlogy is at its heart a human experience. Whatever it is that people encounter, it has an effect upon them. It changes lives. And to a degree, UFOlogists become the only ones with whom the secrets of the soul can be shared. A witness can have a reverence for his or her UFOlogical mentor that bor- ders on the uncomfortable, but is very understandable given the needs that they have after their whole existence has just been turned upside down. A working UFOlogist, especially one that contacts witnesses on a day-to-day basis, will find himself or herself rather unexpectedly thrust into a role that is almost that of a priest or analyst. Frightened, confused, and mystified witnesses turn to us as their only real source of both comfort and illumina- tion. They want us to tell them what is happening, and to reassure them that it is not happening because they are suf- fering from some mental delusion. They may also want some pacifica- tion that their lives have not suddenly turned from safety and normality into a terrible anxiety where they or their kids are not safe, even within their own beds-that at any moment they could be snatched away by goodness knows who bent on doing goodness knows what. Responsibility Naturally, it is the abduction re- searcher who is forced into confronta- tion with these awesome issues much more than someone aiming to take video film of triangular lights that have been reported to plague a local hill. The burden of responsibility is enor- mous, in particular when children are involved in having frightening encoun- ters, as they all too often are. It is never easy knowing what is right to do. Should we offer our theories or beliefs about the UFO mystery-as we will inevitably be requested to do? Do we risk in so doing adding to the fear and confusion, even if we are aim- ing to do the opposite by simply report- ing what we think we know. \"Think,\" of course, is the key word here. Nobody really knows what causes the UFO phenomenon, and we have to be very careful-whatever perspective we approach this from-to make that ig- norance clear. By which I mean we can just as eas- ily send a young child off on a lifelong terror ride by implanting images of un- stoppable alien manipulators as we can destabilize their self-confidence and personal development if we give vent to skeptical thoughts about mental im- agery causing them to see things. Doing what is right in this situation is possibly the hardest part of the role of the UFOlogist. For we easily forget that what is to us just another case is to the witness a traumatic event that will alter their des- tiny. Things that we say to them will alter the course of their lives. I often look back over the 30 years or so that I have been investigating UFOs, recall some witnesses who were young and impressionable, and wonder how much I affected them by whatever I said during my self-centered pursuit of their encounter. I doubt that it always had the ben- eficial effect that I intended. I know that in the early days I did not always stop to assess the implica- tions when a 13-year-old girl years later became the mother of her own young child who might then start to report see- ing or hearing strange things in the night. Would what I said to them 20 years earlier be recalled now as if it had more import than I could ever have honestly intended? This is one of the reasons I became so embroiled in designing the \"Code of Practice,\" as we call it in the UK. UFO groups from around the country got to- gether, and we drew up a set of guid- ing principles-simple do's and don't's- as to how we should work with people. It was a simple thing to do, and in some ways probably ineffective. Self- policing is not something that UFOlogy has ever seemed terribly good at achiev- ing. But we were sending a wake-up call-asking ourselves to stop and think NOVEMBER 2004 MUFON UFO JOURNAL 21"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"about the human dimension behind these close encounters-not just treat them as another case for our files or an extra statistic to add to the facts and figures that we are using to build a pic- ture of this perplexing mystery. UFOs-whatever they are-are seen by human beings, and have an almost unimaginable power to change lives and shape destinies. If we fail to take that into account when we seek answers for ourselves, then we will never see the full truth or act in the interests of our fellow human beings to the maximum extent that it is in our power to do: John Mack certainly knew that UFOlogy went beyond nuts and bolts mechanical questions. We may or may not agree with how he came to interpret the almost mysti- cal questions and superhuman dimen- sions that at times seem to be operat- ing behind the weirdest of all cases. But we cannot deny that he helped us appreciate that vital lesson. Director's Message...

(Continued from Page 14) design, test, and design reviews for the Gemini spacecraft, when Cooper along with Pete Conrad flew in Gemini 5 in 1965. That was a milestone flight for the Gemini program. Nearly eight years before he was accepted as an astronaut, Cooper and his squadron were flying high perfor- mance jet interceptors over Germany, where they tried to intercept a forma- tion of shiny discs flying high above them. After he left the space program, he is quoted as saying: \"While on the Mercury project I would have liked to have met these things, but I never had the opportunity. I believe that there is intelligent life out there that has already visited this planet.\" In 1978 he testified before the United Nations, hoping that the UN would become a central repository for ac- counts of UFO sightings. Although the concept was accepted by the UN, it was never funded. Nevertheless, Cooper never allowed the fact he was a United States Air Force jet pilot, an astronaut, or even a vice president for Walt Disney Produc- tions to intimidate him into denying his belief that UFOs are real and impor- tant to the future of mankind. I would just like to say Godspeed Gordon Coo- per. Ufology is aging. We are losing a lot of wonderful workers in this field each year. While their contributions vary, all are important, and their loss will be felt in many ways. I urge ev- eryone reading this message to focus on their accomplishments, not their frailties-to work with renewed vigor to seek an early solution to the UFO mys- tery. It is long overdue. We lost Betty, John, and Gordon during a very short period of time. I Estate Planning Planned giving can be beneficial both to MUFON and to your own tax and estate situation.

I was inspired by their contribu- tions to the field. That is why I dedi- cated my message to their memory this month. I will do a catch-up message on MUFON business next month.. Review: The Kelly Incident.. (Continued from Page 15) reporter in this book to the realm of UFOs, Karyl also utilizes other UFO accounts in developing her story. Along the way we meet a medical doctor who has an avid interest in UFOs because of incidents which had oc- curred with his father, as well as a thera- pist who is well versed in ufological matters and hypnotic regression. Ray Fowler (SynchroFile, 2004) would also be happy to see synchronicity woven into the story. While this book has UFOs as a ma- jor theme, it is also a love story, as St. Louis Post-Dispatch reporter Helen Wheeler finds romance where she least expects it-in the hills of Kentucky-and with a man who bore little resemblance to what she thought was her ideal in terms of education and sophistication. But all is not right with this yoiing man, and, once again, UFOs are in- volved. Although this is Anna Karyl's first book, it is well written in a style which reminds me of mystery writer Sue Grafton, author of A is for Alibi, B is for Burglar, etc., who is also from Ken- tucky. The author keeps the story moving, and usually ends each chapter in such a way that the reader wants to go on to the next one. While this book may be slanted more toward the female reader, I also found it enjoyable, and would recommend it as a nice diversion from all the heavy, serious material that fills most of our UFO-related reading. It can also serve as a nice introduc- tion to ufology for the uninitiated. 22 MUFON UFO Journal NOVEMBER 2004"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"For advertising, contact John Schuessler, schuessler@mho.net, 303-948-6224.

NOVEMBER 2004 MUFON UFO JOURNAL 23"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"December 2004 Bright Planets (Evening Sky) Saturn (magnitude -0.1), near the Twin Stars of Gemini, remains the sole bright planet in the evening sky. The world with rings rises in the ENE about 6:30 PM in midmonth and moves across the southern sky during the night. Bright Planets (Morning Sky): Planet Parade. From Dec. 17-22, 1 hour before sunrise, all 5 naked-eye planets can be viewed simultaneously, E to W, in their normal order from the Sun-Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn. Mercury is visible low in the SE 1 hour before sunrise during the latter half of December into January. See Venus. Venus (-4.0) rises in the ESE about 5 AM (midmonth). The brilliant planet slides by Mars during the 1st half of the month, closing to within 1.2 de- grees, of the red planet on Dec. 5 and 6. Also during twilight on the 8th the lunar crescent lies between Jupiter and Venus and hovers near Mars and Venus on the 9th. Mercury approaches and passes within a degree of Venus from Dec. 29-31. Mars (1.7), in Libra, rises in the ESE about 4:30 AM and stands low in the SE before sunrise. See Venus. Jupiter (-1.9), in Virgo, rises in the E shortly after 1 AM in midmonth and moves to the SSE at dawn. See Venus. On Dec. 7, from the eastern and cen- tral states, the crescent Moon passes in front of Jupiter in a rare occultation event. The bright planet's disappear- ance behind the Moon's sunlit edge and its reappearance at the Moon's oppo- site dark edge are spectacular sights. The farther east one is, the higher the Moon. The farther west, the more the planet is apt to be occulted close to moonrise or uncovered shortly after. Times of disappearance and reap- pearance at sample cities (AM local time): Atlanta, 3:55-4:53; Boston, 3:59- 5:07.5;||hicago, 2:50-3:54; Dallas, 2:56-3'37f Denver, -2:43; Kansas City (KS/MO), 2:49-3:48; Miami, 4:15- 4:46. Saturn stands halfway up the WSW sky at dawn. Moon Phases: Last quarter—December 4 New moon—December 11 First quarter—December 18 Full moon—December 26 Meteor Shower: The Geminid meteors peak on the night of December 13-14, with a rate before dawn on the 14th of up to about 100 per hour. Unlike last year, there will be no Moon interference this time. The shower's meteors are bright, white, and relatively slow, emanating from the di- rection of the star Castor in Gemini. Two Space Probes: The Huygens probe is scheduled to separate from the Cassini spacecraft (in Saturn orbit) on Christmas Day in preparation for next month's entry into the atmosphere of the satellite Titan. The Deep Impact comet probe is to be launched toward the end of Decem- ber. Next July the spacecraft arrives at Comet Tempel 1, releasing a self- guided \"smart\" impactor to penetrate a comet nucleus for the first time. The Stars: As the autumn sky symbol of the Great Square of Pegasus dips into the W, the bright winter symbol Orion the Hunter ascends in the SW. To the left of Orion is Gemini the Twins. Pollux and Castor mark the heads of the two brothers. Below the hunter rises the brightest star of the night, Sirius. And to Orion's upper right charges the Bull Taurus, his face outlined by the V of the Hyades star cluster and his orange eye Aldeba- ran. The famous little dipper-shaped Pleiades cluster in the bull's shoulder rises to a commanding overhead posi- tion in the midevening heavens. After twenty years Walt Webb writes his final 'The Night Sky\" column This column by Walt Webb marks the 20th anniversary and his final in- stallment of \"The Night Sky\" for the MUFON UFO Journal. It has been the longest running and one of the most popular columns in the history of the Journal, and has been a key source of information for MUFON Field Investigators. Walt has been involved in ufology for nearly half a century, and is re- spected as one of the field's top inves- tigators. His famous cases include the Betty and Barney Hill case, the Buff Ledge Abductions, and many others. Walt has some special projects in mind which will be demanding of his time, so he has decided to \"hang it up\" on this 20th anniversary. There are really no words to convey our appreciation for Walt's skills and dedication over these past two decades, but thank You, Walt, thank you. In the best MUFON tradition, Gavin A. J. McLeod has offered to continue \"The Night Sky\" for the benefit of Jour- nal readers. Gavin has already done a \"dry run\" column, and has a special feature in the works. We look forward to his column over the next 20 years. 24 MUFON UFO Journal NOVEMBER 2004"}]
