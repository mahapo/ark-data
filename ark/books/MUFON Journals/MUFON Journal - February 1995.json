Y ou're tired of reading all the UFO magazines and 'zines, latest UFO books, and UFO newsclippings. You can't stand to watch UFO TV programs like \"Unsolved Mysteries\" or documen- taries or videos anymore. You don't think you can bear to go to yet another UFO conference, convention, or symposium. Your local UFO group/chapter/abduction support group/occult bookstore just isn't fun to hang out at anymore. Your eyes are starting to hurt from watching the skies for too long. What do you do? Sit down in front of your computer terminal! There's a heckuva lot of UFO stuff out there in cyberspace. Get online, dial a BBS or jack into the Internet, and check it out! For the hardcore UFO enthusiast, cyberspace may provide just the \"fix\" you need for your addiction. This is just a small, incomplete list of what you can find in the Electronic Ether. There's an interesting \"interface\" developing be- tween UFOlogy and cyberspace. Computer scientists like Jacques Vallee have often suggested that UFOs themselves may act like a cybernetic 'control system,' and that the nature of \"reality\" itself may be like a holo- gram/Virtual Reality/computer program. Many people have begun examining the UFO problem from the framework of \"Cyberbiology\" — especially the (essen- tially now defunct) Archaeus Project — using a systems approach that more closely factors in the state of the per- cipient ... computer analysis is also being used to find various patterns in sightings, crop circles, mutilations, and other UFO-related phenomena. Like many other disciplines, UFOlogy has definitely been impacted by the personal computer revolution.

But the ones that are the most widespread — FidoNet, OPUS/Rime, OneNet, RelayNet, etc. — generally carry UFO or paranormal echomail groups. The main thing I'm recommending — check out any BBS that carries echomail in your local area code, even if it's not anything as widespread as Fido. Chances are, one of those echomail groups might be UFO-related: so if you post on it. your posting is go- ing out to everywhere there are echoes in the U.S. (or the world), and it's as good in some ways as putting some- thing on Usenet... all for the price of a local call. Using the various echomail UFO conferences is an af- fordable alternative to dialing UFO BBSes outside your area code, because they are generally carried on the major UFO BBSes also. If you want to save money on long-distance calls to UFO boards (and you're not a phone phreak), look into packet-switching services on Public Data Networks (PDN). Right now, the major PSS (PC Pursuit) is no longer available, and many of the others are not 'open platforms' allowing you to dial out wherever you want to —instead they just offer direct connections to various boards. The only one I'm aware of that does allow you to 'openly' dial out (to anywhere PAGE 4 NUMBER 322 FEBRUARY 1995"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL they currently have connections) is Global Access in Charlotte, NC.

I can only tell you about the ones I've accessed — the ones I haven't (like Prodigy or BIX or Peacenet) you're on your own with. America Online Lacks any real UFO/paranormal forum. Right now, there are just isolated discussions in their miscellaneous \"special interest\" lifestyle area. If you're an AOL user, tell them you want a real paranormal forum! In the meantime, in the Omni Magazine Online forum, you can find some interesting UFO files and discussion in their Antimatter area. CompuServe Some nice files and discussion can be found in their Paranormal library/message area, in the Issues Forum.

It's a good way to find UFO newsclippings online, quickly and easily, us- ing keyword searches like \"alien\" or \"UFO.\" PART II: A GUIDE TO THE PERPLEXED N ever used Usenet before? Don't know a modem from a disk drive? Think Cyberspace is one of the rides at Disneyland? Feel basically com- puter-illiterate? I have not the space here to go into de- tail into explaining all these things. Unfortunately, I can't tell you here how to set up a modem, what error- checking or V.34 is, etc., what the Hayes' AT command set is, etc., but I will give you some tips. (My suggestion for people seeking basic \"cyberliteracy\" is to start with the \"Big Dummy's\" Guides to Internet, Bulletin Boards, Modems, Networking, etc. They explain all of these things in plain English and go over concepts step-by- step.) People who are not in the category of the \"per- plexed\" can skip this section. 1. Bulletin board systems. You can find BSSes in your area often by looking in the back of Computer Shopper, which carries a huge list divided up by area code. (Warning: not everything in your area code is a free local call! If it's another city, you may pay 25 cents or more per call, or a 'reduced' long-distance rate!) Other good sources are BoardWatch, BBS, and Online Access magazine. Area-code BBS lists can always be found on other BBSes and online services — they're re- ally all over the place, and you can often find subject- oriented lists (medical BBSes) or type-oriented lists (9600 or faster, graphical, etc.) all over the place too. PAGE. 6 NUMBER 322 FEBRUARY 1995"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL If you're going to be calling long-distance BBSes, be aware that it can be expensive. Call at night, when you have the lowest rates. Many BBSes are free; some offer limited access to non-subscribers and greater access to subscribers; but a good number are pay boards. Investigate whether the BBS charges subscribers a flat rate for unlimited use for a certain period of time, charges a per-hour use rate, or charges users for \"credits\" that they expend in using the system. These bills can rack up too. A good BBS (whether UFO-oriented or not) will of- fer a wide range of services. They will have text and pro- grain files for download, \"doors\" for various games, multi-user chat,.or other multi-user services, message fo- rums on lots of topics (esp. distributed message systems like Fido), informative bulletins of upcoming events, etc.. and perhaps other offerings, like online magazines, databases, or other services. The best and biggest of the BBSes compete with the commercial online ser- vices in terms of their breadth and depth. Be warned, a BBS can have anywhere from 1 to 100 in-dial lines, but depending on its level of use, all of these lines may be busy during certain peak periods. When the BBS costs the least to call (e.g., late at night) is also often the peak period of when people are calling at long-distance, so if you're calling a local board, you may be better off doing it during the daytime. Some BBS systems (like FirstClass for Mac or Windows, Telefinder or NovaTerm for Mac, or RIPscrip for DOS) have a graphical (GUI) \"front- end.\" You can dial them up with basic text-line termi- nal programs, but you're missing out on their visual splendor if you don't possess the special \"client\" pro- grams for dialing them up. These clients programs are almost always available for free download from the boards themselves. 2. Commercial online services. As I said above, I'm only personally familiar with America Online and CompuServe. Certainly, it might be worth your while to check out Delphi, Prodigy, GEnie, Eworld, Windows Network, or BIX. Each have their own mix of costs and benefits, depending on what type of computer you use, what operating system you use, what you use cy- berspace for, what your budget is, and what other kinds of users you want to associate with. The commercial on- line services are easy to subscribe to — many of them basically give out subscriber disks with their client pro- gram and a password for free 2 or more hours trial usage in various magazines. Just remember that with the commercial online ser- vices, in almost every case, you're paying both for being a member of the service, whether you use it or not, and then fees based on how long you're on the service, what areas you access, and the modem speed at which you access them. All of the services have different pay- ment plans, and depending on when and how long you like to be on them may influence which is best for you. Many simply automatically debit your monthly fee di- rectly from your credit card. Commercial services are very user-friendly, often of- fering lots of on-line support, tours, and assistance. There's no 1-800 number to call and wait on hours for — if you've got a problem just send mail. Of course, if your problem is keeping you from getting online in the first place, fortunately most of them do have 1-800 lines to fix that. They are really the best place to start out ex- ploring cyberspace, because they're aimed at \"newbies\" who are just starting to get the hang of things. Many of the commercial services offer navigator or offline mailreader adjuncts which save you time and money. Basically, they automate searching for and doing a lot of the things you might waste time doing yourself on the service. Consider purchasing them, because in the long-run they will definitely prove of value. Be aware that as corporate creatures, commercial online services are likely to subject you to lots of 1) ad- vertising 2) offers of online shopping for goodies galore 2a) offers of spinoff CD-ROMs, books, and so on from the service and 3) free gimmicks, contests, and other \"Publisher's Clearinghouse\" type shlock. If this doesn't bother you (I know it bothers me), well then, no worries. They want you to spend money. If you've got lots of it, well then, no problem. 3 The Internet. Oh boy. What a beastie. Fortunately, at your average local bookstore, there are on aver- age 2.3 bookcases (not shelves) full of books on the Internet, plus a huge bunch of new magazines, like Internet World, Net Guide, and so on. Believe me, you'd have to be blind and deaf not to be able to find some- thing about the Internet in this overhyped, saturated en- vironment. There are dozens of software/book packages out there with fancy names like \"Internet Membership Guide.\" Don't be bamboozled. The Internet is not an online ser- vice. It's basically a network of (originally UNIX, but now likely to be made up of just about anything) net- works, all interconnected, all over the planet. You don't have to be a member. But you will have to pay (either directly or indirectly) to access it. If you're part of a large university or corporation or governmental entity, congratulations, you may already have access for free (but in the case of students, don't worry, it's coming out of your tuition payment, you just can't see it). The good news here is also that on campus or in your office, you may be able to use Ethernet or other networks for a \"true\" TCP/IP connection, which is anywhere from 10 to 50 times faster than the phone lines, and you'll notice the difference. Otherwise, you have a few options. Many online ser- vices and BBSes offer Internet access of various degrees, and make this a big selling point. Once again, don't be bamboozled. Access may mean you have a net-accessi- ble email address, and that's it. It may mean they pick a FEBRUARY 1995 NUMBER 322 PAGE 7"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL handful of Usenet and Email-exploder lists for you to ac- cess on their system. They may offer only a text-line in- terface, which means, sorry, no World Wide Web. Or they may give you the whole enchilada — all of Internet (every Usenet group, every mailing list, unlimited tel- net/ftp/IRC, a built-in graphical Web browser) at your fingertips. This is rare, so consider yourself lucky. Consider as an alternative to them some of the many publicly accessible UNIX shell systems around the country (pubnixes). There are a whole bunch, and some of them, like Pipeline and World, have gotten fancy. Others, like the WELL, MindVox, and ECHO, offer lots of \"local\" discussion areas and services. A few, like Nyx, are free. Some of these only give you 'shell' level access, so be prepared to work with unfriendly newsreaders like tin and cumbersome mail systems like pine. There are a whole bunch of new startups that offer SLIP connections (like Intercon, etc.) and a package of utilities to run on your system to use over those con- nections. With SLIP or PPP, your machine becomes, at least temporarily, a real \"node\" on the Internet (rather than a parasite on another node) and the cool stuff really begins. Once you've used them, you'll be soured on the plain-vanilla, UNIX-type, text-line prompt way of using Internet. T he \"Information Superhighway\" is on the way, of course, and in plain English terms this may mean that in the near future you may have more than just a phone or asynchronous TV cable line coming into your house. It may be nothing more than ISDN (which for many people is just a dumb upgrade of the phone sys- tem, and too little, too late) or it may be a fiber optic, two-way line, designed to carry digital data (rather than analog sound pulses or television signals) at an incred- ibly fast pace. It may come to your TV set or over something new your phone company gives you. It may even be wireless — something like the new small digi- tal sattelite system dishes which are starting to be sold. Whatever it looks like, expect to pay through the nose, and you heard it from me first. If you want the \"queen\" of Internet — the World Wide Web — in its full glory, be aware that an invest- ment is required. You'll need a multimedia ready PC with a color monitor, and a fast modem (14.4, 19.2, or V.34/28.8 baud). You'll need a graphical operating sys- tem, like Windows NT, Windows, Mac OS, or OS/2. You'll need a SLIP/PPP link to a service provider. And you'll need a client/browser program — in this category, I give hands down to Netscape, which doesn't force you to wait while images are loading. But trust me when I tell you that the real beauty of the Web (real-time video and virtual reality) won't be available until you are on the MBONE (multimedia/multicasting backbone) or other fast digital connection. Get cracking! Cyberspace awaits. PART III: CAVEAT LECTOR There are some risks to doing UFO cyber-ufology. I would be derelict in my duty not to warn you about those. One thing you should know straight away is that, long before Usenet or email, the UFO field was filled with a lot of obsessed \"neurots.\" But originally the UFO field in the 40s and 50s was limited to a small number of enthusiasts, who sent around illegible little xeroxed newsletters to each other (the original 'zines), attacking the government for not revealing the truth to them. Now, with telecommunications as an affordable option to many people, any loon with any interest what- soever in UFOs can get online. If you thought flame wars were bad elsewhere, just lurk in some of the UFO newsgroups. It's like sitting in a sauna. UFOlogists have always been bashing each other, from the very beginning, over whether this or that case is a hoax, whether this or that hypothesis is \"the answer\" or simply preposterous, whether the \"aliens\" are from Proxima Centauri or a black hole near Uranus, whether this or that UFO personality is a liar or a disinformant, whether this or that UFO group has been 'infiltrated,' etc. From the beginning, many UFO buffs have been ex- cessively paranoid, dogmatic, and egotistic. It's a field that has a high weirdness factor in itself, but as John Keel suggests, it draws even weirder people like mag- nets. Obsessional people — the kind that will fill your mailbox with dozens of messages a day — have your kill filters ready. In any UFOlogy conference in cyberspace, you're likely to see complete maniacs like James \"Kibo\" Parry, who get a laugh out of the topic and think they have a right to say idiotic things over and over again, as if their humor improves with practice; complete skeptics who continually flame the supposed \"true believers\" in the conference for being so foolish/naive/credulous/etc.: and complete \"Answer Men\" who think they know WHAT the UFOs are, WHERE in the solar system they are based, HOW their propulsion systems work, WHY they're here, and WHEN the first UFO is going to land on the White House lawn. Between the jokesters, skep- tics, and Answer Men, people sincerely interested in the problem — and people who want to report their own sighting/encounter — are often drowned out. It's not a good idea to report your own sightings or encounters in a public UFOlogy forum. The skeptics and jokesters will harass you, and the Answer Men won't leave you alone until you agree that they are the ones who know best what REALLY happened to you. Hence, I sincerely recommend you find one of the more private sightings report areas on UFO boards maintained by professional organizations. Or call their sightings hot- lines on the phone; many of them maintain 800 #s. (But BEWARE the ones that have 900 #s, which charge you PAGES NUMBER 322 FEBRUARY 1995"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL $8.95/minute.) Going this way means your privacy and sanity are likely to be respected. Feel free to use the more public areas to tell people about your experiences later, but I strongly suggest reporting the sighting first in a place where intelligent people are there to catalogue and handle it. T here are already signs that UFOlogy is getting ready for the multimedia millenium. UFO CD-ROMs are already available, as are some software programs specif- ically designed as sightings and report databases. Programs and applications specifically written for UFOlogy are often out there — generally, they are fairly buggy freeware written by UFOlogists to 'hack' to- gether a solution to some particular problem — and some are worth checking out. But while there are many ways to get UFO information through your (non-net- worked) computer, these methods lack the interactivity provided by UFO boards and conferences. So it's a tradeoff. You can get answers to specific queries in UFO chat areas — but then there's everything else you need to deal with. One other thing. From time to time, you may run into \"hackers\" who claim they've broken into top-secret military and Air Force archives, and gained possession of rare and secret information, like the MJ-12 docu- ments, etc. In general, you should take these people — like any information source who approaches you — with a grain of salt. Much of what the military has com- puterized on UFOs is highly classified, and is main- tained in systems that are not on the MILNET network. Some systems are totally offline, and basically in con- crete bunkers, safe from prying eyes or Van Eck devices. Even \"insiders\" in the military probably lack the access to many of these systems. The operative principle is, of course, caveat lector.

UNITED NATIONS VIDEO On October 2, 1992, a UFO presentation was made at the United Nations in an effort to reopen Decision GA 33/426. The two-hour VHS video tape includes Mohammad A. Ramadan, Stanton T. Friedman. John F. Schuessler and Robert H. Bletchman. Tapes of this mon- umental UN presentation may be purchased by Postal Money Orders, personal check made payable through a U.S. bank or U.S. cash for $19.95 plus $2 for p.&h. to MUFON, 103 Oldtowne Rd., Seguin, TX 78155-4099, U.S.A. MUFON UFO INFORMATION CENTER By the time Journal readers have an opportunity to read this short announcement, MUFON will have opened our new \"UFO Information Center\" in the Colonial Park Complex in Seguin, Texas. Occupying 500 sq. ft. in an office complex along the major north-south highway through Seguin, this is our re- sponse to the many requests received from interested people who would like to visit our headquarter's of- fice to see our photo exhibits, displays, library, video programs, and UFO sales items. Obviously, these exhibits are too extensive to display in the two offices that constitute our MUFON administrative head- quarters at 103 Oldtowne Road. We are very excited about our new information center and exhibit, since it complies with one of MUFON's major objectives — UFO public education. How do visitors find us? Interstate Highway 10 skirts Seguin along the north side and Interstate Highway 35 is only 14 miles to the northwest. Seguin is 35 miles east of San Antonio and 160 miles west of Houston, TX on I.H. 10, the major east-west interstate across the southern U.S.A. We are only 14 miles S.E. off the major north-south I.H. 35 at New Braunfels (S.H. 46) and 22 miles south at San Marcos (S.H. 123), that runs from Canada to Mexico across the middle of the United States. Now that you know where Seguin, TX is located, let's get more specific. If you are driving on I.H. 10, take exit 610 south on Bypass S.H. 123 for two miles and you have arrived. (The exact address is 628 Highway 123 Bypass, Suite 10, along the west side of the divided parkway.) If you are on I.H. 35 at San Marcos, drive south on S.H. 123 for 22 miles to find us. If you should exit I.H. 35 at New Braunfels, pro- ceed SW for less than 14 miles on S.H. 46 to its in- tersection with I.H. 10 and then proceed east follow- ing the I.H. 10 directions above. As you drive south on S.H. Bypass 123, look for the large blue on white sign in front of the office complex with the an- nouncement \"UFO INFORMATION CENTER.\" The information center has another large blue on white sign on the top of the building above the office com- plex double doors stating \"MUFON\" and \"Mutual UFO Network.\" There is plenty of parking available for visitors. If visitors happen to arrive when the in- formation center is not open, please go to the nearest telephone and call 379-9216. As they say in Texas \"Y'all come and see us.\" Warren \"Ed\" Benjamin, State Section Director from Wichita Falls, TX, has the distinction of being the first visitor to sign the registration book. If by chance you fail to take these directions with you on your trip, please call MUFON at (210) 379-9216 or go to the Chamber of Commerce office at 427 North Austin Street in Seguin for directions. FEBRUARY 1995 NUMBER 322 PAGE 9"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL ALIENS, ELECTRICITY &. ALLERGIES A new theory about alien abductions proves to be both shocking and controversial. By Albeit Budden T he experiences of Whitley Streiber have been publicized at great length. His first overt book on his \"visitor\" experiences, Communion (1987) out- lined a catalog of perceptions about which, to his credit, he remains undecided regarding their reality status. His descriptions of them in Communion mirror this, and the reader with no ideological axe to grind regarding the existence of extraterrestrials or otherwise, can only con- cur with this healthy suspension of belief. They appear too vivid and too real by half for dreams, and too absurd and unlikely for reality. One may wonder what options we are left with. Readers by now, may have an inkling of what I am about to show. It is this: that like all experiencers of such perceptual phenomena, known as abductees or con- tactees, Whitley Streiber has a treatable condition called Electrical Hypersensitivity (EH) and Multiple Allergy, and his perceptions are symptomatic of this. That is to say, such EH status individuals experience vivid hallu- cinatory dramatisations in response to prolonged expo- sure to environmental fields, both artificial and natural. Signs, symptoms and causative factors are laid out and explained in my book, Allergies and Aliens — The Visitation Experience: An Environmental Health Issue. Let us examine the parameters of electrical hyper- sensitivity (EH) and multiple allergy, and compare them not only with Streiber's descriptions of his experiences, but also with his known background. In Allergies and Aliens, I state that individuals who exhibit this condition have been exposed to a major electrical event, often in their formative years (Monro). This can be proximity to a lightning strike, ball lightning, earthlights, electro- convulsive therapy, defibrillation, major electrocution, etc. Such magnitudes of electrical exposure cause phys- ical trauma to the organs and tissues which weaken the body permanently, and set it up for the development of electrical hypersensitivity in later life. Of such electrical trauma, John Gilroy, M.D., has said that \"The passage of an electric current through the brainstem can produce Parkinsonism, cranial nerve deficits, or cortiocospinal tract involvemeni with spasticity . . .which is often fol- lowed by complete recovery.\" (Basic Neurology, p. 340. Pergamon Press, 1990) Subsequent prolonged exposure to electromagnetic fields, like those found in areas of electrical and elec- tronic pollution — dubbed \"hot spots\" by the World Health Organization — and frequently in combination with geoelectrical fields from faults, will eventually precipitate EH. Such hot spots are created in the envi- ronment by radio-frequency (RF) transmitters, from a variety.of sources, e.g., telecommunication masts, TV/radio station antennae, mobile phone systems, police networks, military and civilian radar (pulsed mi- crowaves), radio hams, CB enthusiasts, radiocab of- fices, and so on. Such hot spot locations can be easily plotted on maps as ground reflections of a component of radio-wave propagations. (See Allergies and Aliens.) Numerous other hot spot scenarios exist involving power line systems, pylons, electrical sub-stations and combi- nations of these with RF fields and faults which produce potent hot spots alone or in combination with artificial electronic/electrical fields as an intermodulation effect. Those subject to EH also develop allergies to food and other substances (C.W. Smith, J.Monro), as out- lined in Allergies and Aliens. However, I have not in- terviewed Whitley Streiber to ask him pertinent ques- tions. I do however, like everyone else, have the de- scriptions of his experiences and some background in- formation from his books, especially Communion, and from other works by people who have looked at his case closely. One of these books is The Omega Project by Professor Kenneth Ring, which is unavailable here in the UK, but was sent to me by Professor Ring a few weeks ago. MAJOR ELECTRICAL EVENT In Allergies and Aliens I state that proximity to ball lightning would constitute such an event as an electrical initiation, especially in formative years. In The Omega Project, Ring notes: \"Interestingly, Whitley Streiber has described some incidents that he witnessed as a child that appear to have involved ball lightning and makes it clear that they can be terrifying indeed.\" (p. 198) It does appear therefore, as predicted, that Streiber was ex- posed to a major electrical event in his formative years. In my book I also list electrical demonstration as an- other major electrical event to which young people might be exposed. As an example of this I often think of how the Science Museum in Exhibition Road, London, used to discharge a million-volt spark every day as a spectacular demonstration to impress young scientists- to-be, and to initiate them into the wonders of electricity. I now also wonder if another sort of initiation took place in the physiology of the individual who used to perform this demonstration on a daily basis, as such multiple major electrical events would have \"primed\" his bodily system for EH allergies in later life. In relation to Streiber however, in Communion, we find the following telling passage: PAGE 10 NUMBER 322 FEBRUARY 1995"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL The sudden influx of raised levels of elec- tromagnetic energy into a location can en- ergize electrical circuitry so that appliances, especially if they are electronically sophis- ticated in design, will spontaneously acti- vate. \"When we were thirteen I apparently announced to him that 'spacemen' had taught me how to build an antigravity machine, which I was constructing in my bedroom. This was.in the summer of 1958 ... I cer- tainly remember building it... it was only an assem- bly of electromagnets .. . When I plugged my assem- blage in, there was a great buzzing ... the lights in the house began to pulsate. The whole thing whined and fluttered. There were showers of sparks ... As the machine destroyed itself the pulsation of the house lights became a dimming, until the bulbs glowed an orange-red. Then they burst to blazing life, a good number of then blowing out in the process.\" (p. 116) Again, it appears that Streiber was exposed to a ma- jor electrical event through an electrical demonstration. In my own book I noted that reports of such events were common between the ages of 12 and 14. (p. 60) However, UFOs themselves, as anomalous electro- magnetic phenomena, e.g., earthlights (Devereux, 1982), can act upon the biological system in the same way, as they also present powerful electrical allergens. Streiber's experiences with such atmospheric phenomena are also evident in his books. HOT SPOT ACTIVITY Hot spots can be plotted on maps relatively easily. In or- der to determine if specific locations are electromag- netically active in this way however, the exact location has to be known. I have no precise details regarding Streiber's situation, in particular the site of his log- cabin country retreat in which many of his most vivid experiences took place and to which he refers in Communion. However, there are a number of recognisable, seem- ingly inexplicable, phenomena which do occur in hot spots. One of them is the power surge where electrical equipment behaves in odd ways, and sometimes mal- functions permanently. The sudden influx of raised lev- els of electromagnetic energy into a location can ener- gize electrical circuitry so that appliances, especially if they are electronically sophisticated in design, will spon- taneously activate. For example, Microwave News (July/August, 1993) recently ran a feature on the electromagnetic interference to electric wheelchairs for the disabled. It noted (p. 15) that \"The agency (FDA) found that some electronically controlled wheelchairs would unexpectedly stop, start or turn when exposed to radio-frequency or microwave radiation . . .\" This example is echoed by my own experiences of a tape-transcribing machine starting and stopping spon- taneously due to power surges from the local police station antenna 500 meters away, which can be detected by a simple field meter. Similarly, Streiber reports that his electronic burglar alarm would sometimes activate, causing the security lights to come on: \"My eyes went straight to the burglar-alarm panel be- side the bed. The system was armed and working per- fectly. Not a covered door or window was opened, and nobody had entered ... I thought to myself that I would take the gun and go downstairs if the light came on. No sooner had I thought that than it did. I dashed downstairs but saw nobody even though the light was still on. Subsequently the light never worked right, although it was in good order that very evening. Later in the fall the unit was replaced.\" (Communion. pp. 23-24) Such electrical events are typical of power surges. In Allergies and Aliens I show that it is the EH — status in- dividual who has repeated \"alien visitations\" in such EM hot spots. Whitley Streiber is electrically hypersensitive, FEBRUARY 1995 NUMBER 322 PAGE 1 I"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL and unfortunately, his log-cabin, chosen for its seclusion and to \"get away from it all,\" is almost certainly in a hot spot location. PARAMAGNETIC AND GYROMAGNETIC EFFECTS This is also borne out by other details he reports. For ex- ample, he tells of the spontaneous movement of doors. Such eerie happenings are caused by gyromagnetic phe- nomena, where objects in the path of a magnetic field will turn. Those made of ferrous materials move with the direction of the field, and those which are dielectric, such as glass, wood, plastic, etc., move against the field direction. The fact that such an environmental effect was ob- served in conjunction with the beginning of a \"visitor\" experience is also confirmatory of the presence of elec- tromagnetic fields producing this vivid electrically-dri- ven hallucinatory experience. Streiber writes: \"... I noticed that one of the double doors leading into our bedroom was moving closed. As they close outward, this meant that the opening was getting smaller. .. What could be moving the door? Then I saw edging around it a compact figure. It was so dis- tinct and yet so completely, impossibly astonishing that at first I could not understand it at all.\" And in case you are thinking that it is unlikely for a hallucinatory perception and a physical effect to coincide in this way, it was psychical researcher Andrew MacKenzie who, in his definitive book, Hauntings and Apparitions (Heinemann, 1982), reported how in the massive Census of Hallucinations, formed figures are frequently seen to behave in terms of the environment, i.e., to move around furniture, through doorways, etc. It is only through a closer study of such phenomena that one realizes how different the characteristics of halluci- nations really are from the common sense view. SYSTEMIC EFFECTS Also, numerous systemic effects can be identified in Streiber's accounts. Some of them are evidently allergic reactions to food, substances or fields, and others are recognizable as direct effects upon the hypersensitive nervous system of the electromagnetic irradiation to which he was subjected. Various passages provide clues: \"It was as if I had become profoundly paralysed. Although I desperately wanted to move I could not.\" (p. 24) \"Even if I had been able to make a sound, which I doubt, I couldn't try.\" (p. 24) \"While I had up until that point been able to retain a degree of control of my attention, this now left me and PAGE 12 It would appear that it is this spontaneous, sudden and mysterious electrically-induced terror which is instrumental in precipitating the post-abduction trauma syndrome. Indeed, what could be more traumatic than to be jolted awake with such intense feel- ings electrically stimulated within the indi- vidual, in a context where they normally feel most protected and secure: the pri- vacy of their own bed in the middle of the night? I became entirely given over to extreme dread. The fear was so powerful that it seemed to make my per- sonality completely evaporate. This was not a theoret- ical or even a mental experience, but something pro- foundly physical.\" (p. 25) It has been found that EH patients have, outside of any \"visitor\" experience, become completely immobile and mute as a reaction to field exposure. Also, this strange overwhelming feeling of terror has been in- duced by the electrical stimulation of areas of the brain: the hippocampal formation and amygdala. In a clinical setting, this has been induced by electrodes at specific sites, but with the EH brain, no contact is required, and fields rippling through a domestic environment can pro- duce all manner of strange and disturbing effects. Remember, Streiber himself insists: \"This was not... a mental experience, but something profoundly physi- cal,\" (p.25) i.e., the electrical stimulation of the brain. It would appear that it is this spontaneous, sudden and mysterious electrically-induced terror which is instru- mental in precipitating the post-abduction trauma syn- drome. Indeed, what could be more traumatic than to be jolted awake with such intense feelings electrically stim- ulated within the individual, in a context where they nor- mally feel most protected and secure: the privacy of their own bed in the middle of the night? CHILLS AND FEVERS In Allergies and Aliens, I also mention how EH indi- viduals experience sudden extremes of hot or coldness unrelated to temperature. This appears to be due to the effect of fields on the part of the brain called the hypo- thalmus, which is concerned with the regulation of bod- ily temperature. I have regularly found cases of strange inexplicable fevers reported by abductees, or inappro- priate icy feelings, which in acute cases may quickly al- ternate. Streiber reports: \"I would be working and suddenly I would get cold and start to shake ... I took my temperature during NUMBER 322     FEBRUARY 1995"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL one of these experiences and found that it was 96.6 at the outset, and 98.8 at the height of the 'fever.' Afterward it dropped to 97.0.\" (p. 34) I could go on like this, identifying the effects of fields on the EH-status individual and applying them to what Streiber describes in Communion. However, read- ers could do this for themselves, as all of these symp- toms are laid out and predicted in Allergies and Aliens. PHYSICAL TRAUMA Hot spots which consist of intersecting microwave beams from communication/military transmitters have very high field strengths. This is because the areas of in- tersection can double or triple the field concentration as the case may be. Such powerful electrical areas can create physical effects upon the individual through a number of mechanisms (e.g., re-radiation, electrical burns). With the EH-status individual, lesser field strengths will produce visible and sometimes lasting physical effects upon the body: redness, swelling, scars, pin- hole like lesions in the skin, bruise-like marks on limbs, and so on. Because abductees have electrical allergies, which in effect is what EH is, the body reacts allergically to fields by producing these physi- cal responses. The content of the abduction experience mirrors these field effects on the body by producing imagery which is appropriate to how the body is reacting at any given moment. There are dozens of examples of this coinciding of physical field effect with the action within the abduction dramatisation, as the field effects upon the body cue appropriate hallucinatory images. This is why the abduction takes the form it does — an operation or examination of the body. In this way, the imagery of the experience is driven by the fields pass- ing through the brain and body. One abductee awoke with a red wheal around her wrist under a stainless- steel watch strap she had kept on overnight. The field had been re-radiated by the steel, producing an aller- gic reaction. She had experienced an alien grip her firmly by the wrist to float her to a waiting ship. She had the marks to prove it... I have mentioned that the brain is stimulated by fields to produce various experiential effects. Auditory, vi- sual and olfactory hallucinations as focal seizures can be induced by field stimulation. Streiber reports of an alien figure: \"He had been given the box and now slid it open, re- vealing an extremely shiny, hair-thin needle ... I be- came aware — I think I was told — that they proposed to insert this into my brain ... I heard myself say, \"You could let me smell you\" .. . The odor was dis- tinct . . . There was a slight cardboard scent to it... a subtle overtone that seemed a little like cinnamon . .. AND ALIENS The Visitation Experience: An Environmental Health Issue there was a bang and a flash, and I realised that they had performed the proposed operation on my head. This is a typical sequence which unfolds in response to specific field effects. The unconscious dips into its picture library as it anticipates and becomes aware of how the fields are affecting the brain and presents, in this example, the aliens intent on tampering with it. The needle represents the intrusive nature of the fields, but incongruously, the olfactory areas of the brain are kin- dled into activity, and Streiber smells the aliens. Then the seizure, as an electrical anomaly, discharges and the experiential effects of a bang and a flash are pro- duced. ALLERGIES Abduction or visitation dramatisations also contain what I have termed \"welfare messages.\" These are statements or commentaries on the state of the body and consist of symbolic actions which relay dysfunctional informa- tion from the body via the unconscious to the conscious mind. They are frequently quite easy to understand once they are recognised for what they are: statements about the health of the abductee as exclusively personal sym- bols, usually in terms of the dietary, chemical and elec- tromagnetic stresses that the body is coping with. FEBRUARY 1995 NUMBER 322 PAGE 13"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL Streiber at one point describes a series of episodes with a dietary theme: \"Now I have added to this recollection a vivid mem- ory of the being pushing a bladder down my throat. This is not the only recollection I have of being made to eat things by the visitors . . . This is associated with a perfectly terrible memory of eating what I have al- ways thought was a rotten pomegranate, which was so bitter that it almost split my head apart. . . Something might have been stuffed in my mouth ...\" And: \"In short, my hallucinatory friends seem to.have learned something about how to get me to digest whatever it is they are trying to feed me.\" (p. 119) . D reams relay symbolic information about the emo- tional state and life-flow of the individual, but these visionary dramas are produced to convey far more ur- gent and immediate information about the physiological state of the abductee: the existence of masked aller- gies. Streiber is allergic. I suspected this as soon as I saw his photo on the cover of Communion, as he, like many. other allergic individuals, displays the characteristic double wrinkle under the eyes known as Dennie's sign. (See back cover of Allergies and Aliens.) * Typically, Streiber makes numerous other references to seemingly inexplicable periods of illness that he con- nects with his visitor experiences in some way, and after examining the text of Communion, there is no doubt in my mind that it is sprinkled with descriptions of allergic reactions, and that Streiber seems totally unaware of these masked allergies. However, quite rightly he con- cludes: \"Maybe, though, there was another truth here. Perhaps the hypnosis revealed not just the possible presence of visitors but the action of a hidden and tremendously therapeutic potential which, if correctly marshaled, could be of great value.\" (p. 75) These are the \"welfare messages.\" \"NASAL IMPLANTS\" An analysis of Streiber's experiences in terms of elec- trical hypersensitivity and multiple allergy due to exposures to fields in EM hot spots could go on end- lessly. There is so much confirmatory material in his books, one is spoilt for choice. However, there is one specific phenomenon that has been consistently reported by abductees as well as Streiber. In the belief-system that has been woven around these expe- riences it is referred to as the \"nasal implant.\" This, according to the fundamentalists, is the insertion of a miniscule monitoring device into the upper nasal cavi- ty by the aliens. Such events are often accompanied by genuine physical trauma causing nose-bleeds and persistent discomfort to the abductee. In Communion Streiber says: \"During the third week of March I had a very peculiar thing happen to me ... I awoke and found myself un- able to move or even open my eyes. I had the distinct impression that there was something in my left nostril, and that it was being slowly moved up my nose. When I tried to struggle, I heard a pop like an apple crunching between my eyes. The next thing I remem- bered it was morning ... I noticed during the day that my nose hurt. There was a little bleeding, but. .. my wife and son had reported similar injuries.. . they'd both had episodes of nasal bleeding, and little knots in their nostrils . . .\" (pp. 128-129) And: .\"By far the largest number of intrusions were into the nostril, right into the olfactory nerve with its connection to the deepest core of the brain and behind that nerve, the temporal lobe.\" (p. 129) Researchers have even gone as far as arranging for abductees to have CAT scans, and have concluded that the \"probe\" is detectable as a magnetic resonance and is very small. , One must remember that all of these experiences take place in the intrusive electromagnetic fields of hot spots. Therefore, anything made of a ferrous material will be disturbed in the the field direction, and they will be especially reactive if they are already magnetic. In Nature, Vol. 301, January 6, 1983, three re- searchers — Robin Baker, Janice G. Mather and John H.Kennaugh of the Department of Zoology at the University of Manchester — investigated the presence of magnetic materials in humans and found that the largest deposits of magnetic iron particles are in the spheroid si- nus. There is even a micro-photograph showing a dis- tinctive dark layer and they comment: \"If-we accept that human sinus bones are naturally magnetic, at least three tentative hypotheses for the observed deposits may be offered ... the sinus bones are part of a storage or dumping site for iron ... the magnetic deposits are concerned with magnetic field detection [or] the magnetic material is involved in some way with the growth and repair of bones ...\" ' It is no coincidence that those who undergo abduction experiences do so in an electromagnetic context and that they report physical trauma in the very part of their anato- my where there are the largest deposits of magnetic iron. Such deposits would therefore, be subject to magne- tostrictive effects where the magnetic field distorts metallic materials. It produces an auditory soundwave as a click if the field then suddenly drops. This sudden de-magnetization is called the Page effect. This is un- doubtably the \"pop\" that Streiber describes. Also, he PAGE 14 NUMBER 322 FEBRUARY 1995"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL mentions the link in spatial and neurological terms with the temporal lobes. The field would be re-radiated from the magnetic layer to this area. I think most researchers are aware of Michael Persinger's work with magnetic fields and the temporal lobes. Also, such magnetic iron particles would turn sud- denly and violently with the field direction (gyromagnetic effects), causing the physical trauma to the nasal tis- sues, hence the minor bleeding. The fact that other fam- ily members were also affected similarly is evidence of their common electromagnetic context, i.e., a hot spot. FINALE It is fully appreciated that the identifications presented here will not be welcomed by a good number of notable figures in the UFO study establishment. My immediate reaction to this is: Too bad! The bigger they come, the harder they crack. The truth may not be as exciting as aliens from outer space, but it has its own stark beauty. It is evident that a good number of good people have taken not only one wrong turning, but countless wrong turnings in their thinking on this fascinating phenome- non, which is an interaction between the human body/mind and the electromagnetic environment.

John Carpenter , o \"New Directions\" A s the New Year rings in, 1 stop to ponder where we have been and where we are trying to go with the goals of Urology. Despite the incessant snap- ping and clawing by debunkers and the on-going inse- curity of scientists to become seriously involved, there have been important gains in the public awareness, ed- ucation, media altitudes, and overall acceptance this past year. The year 1994 was one in which John Mack. MD brought much credible attention and debate regard- ing the reality of UFO abductions on nearly every talk show or news program on the air. Despite how Ufologists may have graded these shows, success was already achieved through the splash of attention his book Abduction and his appearances created — not unlike when Communion and Intruders caught the public's eye. The year 1994 also saw a very well done, made-for- cable movie, Roswell. appear on Showtime, bringing a blushing United States Air Force out of a sealed closet after 47 years only to stumble with another unsatisfying explanation. Even Larry King took his live cable talk show to Area 51 to investigate such government se- crecy. OMNI magazine devoted half a year or six issues in an unprecedented manner to UFO accounts. Dan Rather and his esteemed 48 Hours took a moderate to fa- vorable stance toward the possibility that UFOs could possibly exist. Phil Klass has nearly disappeared alto- gether as a public debunker — you might say he has been \"out-klassed\" by skeptics with higher credentials. And the Fox Network has been the UFO buff's weekend delight Friday through Sunday with a smorgasbord of anomalous treats including The X-Files. Sightings, and Encounters. Even cable television's The Learning Channel has been airing several impressively devel- oped documentaries on UFOs and abductions. In fact, with Unsolved Mysteries and other programs devoting more serious attention to the subject of UFOs, there is hardly a week that can go by without two or more spe- cials aired on some aspect of Ufology! When I offi- cially entered this field in 1988, it was fortunate to view one decent program on UFOs per year! The video camera and computer revolution has evolved Ufology in new directions We have seen how the number of UFOs captured on home video cameras has steadily and dramatically increased — much to the delight of researchers. But computers are taking us much further than we would have possibly dreamed just five years ago.

Dreams are not subjective, according to Harpur, because the conscious mind does not create them; they happen to us. He is proposing a radical re-alignment of what we regard as reality. All reality is \"primarily metaphorical, imagina- tive, daimonic.\" To most people this would sound like a pretty good definition of fiction, but Harpur wants the dialectic of real vs. unreal dissolved in favor of literal vs. metaphoric realities. You won't be able to dismiss any- thing, be it UFOs. unicorns, or Utopia, as unreal any- more. It was such an annoying word, an insult to dream- ers everywhere. A shorthand description of this book might be Fortean mysticism.With its plentiful accounts of UFOs, abduc- tions, fairies, angels, black dogs, bigfoot, crop circles. Marian visions, witches, satanist delusions, and bogus social worker stories, the book works nicely as a sampler of Forteana. Here and there are enjoyable observations of similarities between the various categories like that in- volving fairies and bigfoot and suggestions of cattle mutilations in fairy lore. There's also some delightful critical thinking like his remarks on Budd Hopkins' handling of Virginia Horton's meeting with an enchanted deer which has a uniquely charming sensibility. On the other hand, one has to contend with notions like ''the nonspatiality of the Otherworld is represented by multispatiality.\" All UFO theories are strikingly sim- ilar in that they they are all literal renderings of spatial metaphors: outer space, inner earth, future time, other di- mensions, subterranean earth energy, and projected un- conscious. Future time as a spatial metaphor? Where's the debunkers' theory of misinterpretations of conven- tional phenomena and where's the spatial component in it? Uncertainty also has to greet his contention that sub- atomic particles are daimons because they are paradox- ically there and not-there. \"Like UFOs they cannot be measured exactly: we can calculate their speed, or their position, but not both.\" Deep, but not too swift, a ratio- nalist might say. Harpur foresees this book would be difficult for peo- ple with 'scientistic' sensibilities and warns they will wave it off with denunciations of it-as inconsistent and unsystematic and complain about the absence of expla- nations. They dismiss Forteana generally as trivial, ab- surd, and repellent, but, quoting Plutarch, he warns \"one thing we must not do is ignore them — he who denies them breaks the chain that unites the world to God.\" In more psychological terms, we will experience \"the re- 'turn of the repressed.\" Our present age proves victory over the daimons is hollow; we simply end up making a hell of our world and suffer a soul slaughter. The search for explanations, he frankly admits, is futile. Daimonic phenomena, \"by definition, cannot be explained.\" Causal explanations turn out to be further daimons; images and myths tricked out for contempo- rary fashions. Newton and Darwin will someday be seen as mere superstition. One needs humility, he ad- vises, yet puzzlingly quotes St. John of the Cross who felt, \"All visions, revelations, heavenly feelings are not worth the least act of humility ... Many souls, to whom visions never come, are incomparably more advanced in the way of perfection than others to whom many have been given.\" Maybe the chain to God will stand a little indifference to daimons. There is so much deceit surrounding such phenom- ena; the failed predictions of apocalypse, those trickster- possessed crop circle makers, all those unfortunates who confuse metaphorical things for literal. There's al- ways a danger of descending into madness. Only a few wise folk like Keel and Jung come out the wiser. Harpur tells us. But what are the odds you or I will be the lucky ones? And come to think of it, was Jung really all that lucky? H arpur is pleased to say his work belongs in the same tradition as Jung. He retells the story of Jung's descent into madness following his break with Freud. He notes it marked a downward turn in his life \"in a worldly sense,\" but ultimately made him into a shaman. Readers might want to consult John Kerr's A Most Dangerous Method for a richer understanding of the personal di- mension of this collapse which includes an emotional entanglement with Sabina Spielrein, who was obsessed with the Siegried myth. Jung's withdrawal from life and absorption with self and myth may constitute a cure, but critics might say it was an indulgence — that time and new relationships would have done the same. His writings are revered by a few, but dreaded by many. Harpur's reverence for Jung is manifest in his claim- ing Jung recognized the unrecognizable when he alone was able to grasp the meaning of flying saucers. Jung's opinion was rather more modest and tentative and prop- erly so. His was the first effort at trying to understand the psychic component of UFO mythology in any depth. Many things seem doubtful about it today. His most quoted idea was that flying saucers were mandala sym- PAGE16 NUMBER 322 FEBRUARY 1995"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL bols and thus a modern symbol of order and psychic to- tality. This was wrong. The dominant emotion in saucer reports is fear, but mandalas are accompanied by feel- ings of psychic integration and tranquil ity. He suggested the cause of UFO rumors involves the emotional ten- sions and collective distress of the world \"suffering un- der the strain of Russian policies.\" But now the Cold War is over, and they still proliferate. He also suggests they involve the dawning of the Age of Aquarius and a changing of the gods heralding long-lasting transfor- mation of the collective psyche. It all looks rather quaint in the aftermath of short-lived transformations like beat- niks, hippies, yuppies, radical theology, the age of nar- cissism, the new age, etc. There is a failure to explore the phenomenon's tricksterish aspects which others would later emphasize. Harpur devotes a whole chapter to the relevance of paranoia, but Jung doesn't mention the word once, a blindness that can't be said of Joost Meerloo, a major French psychologist, who wrote on UFOs only a few years later. J ung's unfortunate influence on Harpur is particularly evident in this hypothesis: \"Such may be the case with all seers of apparitions: it may be their lack of imagination which compels Imagination to represent itself in spec- tacular external manifestations ... Those who have seized the daimonic through imagination do not need to be seized by it.\" This is contradicted by Donald Ward's field research on supernatural experiences involving hundreds of informants: \"One of the most striking facts to emerge from my study is that 7 out of every 10 of the subjects who have contacted me have been creative artists of some kind, with painting and poetry leading the list. Although most of these artists are not professional, they either are or have been quite active in their artistic productivity.\" [Ward, \"The Little Man Who Wasn't There,\" Fabula, 18, #314 (1977) pp. 212-25.] Harpur similarly believes that disbelievers are the principal re- porters of UFOs while those who want to see them don't. This forgets Kenneth Ring's survey which showed UFO experiences tend to happen to those who don't just be- lieve in UFOs, but in alternative realities generally. There are other notions in this book which play on a poetry of opposites. He sees a societal return of the re- pressed evident in a culture's experience of the dai- monic. Victorian society's overmaterialism is inverted in an enthusiasm for spiritualism. Overmasculine Christianity is visited by Marian visions. He thus offers the notion that the Grays are a contemporary American inversion of our present overemphasis on feelings and sensitivity to others. They are a return of our repressed cold depths in the soul which connect us downwards, backwards to death. It's almost beautiful. He goes on to ponder whether they represent a re- gression from, or an improvement over, the Space Brothers of the Fifties. He decides they are an im- provement because of their implicit criticism of our overtechnologized culture. The perverted sexuality of the Grays however would entirely convince most diagnos- ticians they are a regression from the relatively mature sexuality of the Utopian Space Brothers. The Space Brothers, we must add, were critical of the social order of their time, but the nuclear threat took precedence for obvious reasons. Harpur's position has the aroma of a Whiggish historical slant. The anti-technological senti- ments of environmentalism only gained prominence in the Sixties and its seems unfair to consider the Space Brothers degenerate for being products of their time, un- able to foresee the political corrections of later decades. Rationalist-types will ultimately regard this book an oddity since it does not pander to their ambitions for clarity and explanation. It rambles along, playing with analogies, but doesn't seem to lead anywhere. Harpur avers a scientific approach would do violence to the nature of daimonic reality. One can't dispute that. For those who get this book, but can't fathom the style, I rec- ommend David Gelertner's The Muse in the Machine: Computerizing the Poetry of Human Thought (Free Press, 1994). Daimonic Reality is an exaltation of what Gelertner terms low-focus analogical thought. Harpur's realignment of reality is an effort to evoke the con- creteness of that mode of thought, to make the reader live in a mystical vision where all links with all, to build a chain uniting the world and the daimonic. That is perhaps fine if you are planning on becoming a shaman. Most everyone else will prefer to keep the word unreal- ity in their vocabulary. It bites. Grand Illusions: The Spectral Reality Underlying Sexual UFO Abductions, Crashed Saucers, Afterlife Experiences, Sacred Ancient Sites, and Other Enigmas. By Dr. Gregory Little, White Buffalo Books, Memphis, TN 38190, softcover, 1994, 271 pgs., $19.95 Reviewed by Peter Jordan S peculating on the nature of UFO abductions, author Whitely Streiber has stated: \". .•. I strongly suspect that the experience represents a response to some natural phenomenon, probably of an electromagnetic nature, and that the forms it takes depend upon the enculturation of the affected individuals. I say this because my own experience with the phenomenon has been extremely ex- tensive, and I have been able to observe details of its in- telligence that so strongly point to its human origins that I can only say that, if aliens are here, they have learned to mimic the inner mind of man.\" FEBRUARY 1995 NUMBER 322 PAGE 17"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL Merging gracefully with Streiber's views, UFO re- searcher and psychologist Dr. Gregory Little, in his lat- est book. Grand Illusions, ushers readers down a well- trodden but freshly-decorated path of paranormal theory — a path where the ancestral footprints of Jung, Keel and Vallee lay venerably enshrined. Beginning with a chapter on \"conspiracy,\" Little takes a hard jab at zealous ET theorists whom he sees trapped by self-delusion. Simply and lucidly. Little ex- plains how social psychological processes (such as se- lective attention and confirmation bias) commonly infect UFOlogists, distorting truth and fostering irrational be- lief systems. MJ-12 and Roswell are the main focus of his attack and sustain particularly shameful bruising. Turning to Forteana in the next chapter, Little un- covers further evidence of shady myth-making. Newspaper coverage of an alleged \"snake shower\" in Memphis ( an incident cited by Fort himself) is traced to a probable sighting of \"horsehair worms,\" while the dematerialization of a steamship called the \"Iron Mountain\" owes its inspiration, Little shows, to simple lack of publicity surrounding the actual sinking of the boat. Shifting back to UFOs, Little identifies an over- looked terrestrial source of high-purity magnesium found at the famous Ubatuba site in Brazil in 1957; and, travelling to Gulf Breeze, finds the ET hoopla stirred by the Florida flap woefully undeserved. Noting the proximity of Pensacola Naval Base to Gulf Breeze, he asks (not unreasonably) if the sightings might have been staged as an \"experiment\" in mass psychology. From Chapter 3 forward Jung's archetypal influence expands with great force. Documenting stunning paral- lels between modern UFO abductions, fairy lore and Medieval incubus and succubus legends, Little attempts to dismantle \"nuts-and-bolts\" theories which remain blinded, in his view, to the \"smoke-making\" machinery cagily tucked in back of the scenery. Electromagnetic and protean in nature, UFOs represent what is perceived as a \"fluidlike process of intelligent energy forces capable of moving back and forth between energy frequencies and physical matter frequencies.\" These archetypal ex- periences are facilitated, Little argues, by intense changes in brain chemistry (such as endorphine levels) as well as geomagnetic forces (such as earthquakes and those pro- duced by solar wind). Michael Persinger, a Canadian neu- ropsychologist who implicates earth stress and neuro- chemical processes in UFO and paranormal experiences as well, however, is criticized fairly by Little for dis- missing the events as hallucinatory and for failing to in- corporate \"the possibility that an exterior intelligence could be at work in the 'electrical forces' that come from the earth during seismic activity.\" Besides brain science and geophysics, Little draws many diverse sources of knowledge into his specula- tions; his writing reveals a mind of remarkable range. One finds analysis of UFO cases interspersed with lively commentary on Egyptian archeology and mythology, Near-Death experiences, Native Indian legends and rit- uals, cattle mutilations, Biblical revelations, Masonic cults and ancient astronaut theory. Careful not to lard his sentences with stultifying jargon or puffy language, Little succeeds in making the abstract luminously sim- ple. Such accessibility in a book of this depth is rare, in- deed; educators would probably find that it would serve well as an introductory textbook in college courses deal- ing with UFO and paranormal experience. Fully indexed with a respectable bibliography, the book contains numerous photos as well as garish car- toons by professional illustrator John Michael McCarthy, making Grand Illusions not only provocative, but darkly witty as well.

UFO Datsabase Mapping and Research Tool Available from Larry Hatch Software, 142 Jeter Street, Redwood City, CA 94062-1957 Reviewed by Edward ). Zeller A fter more than 17 years of using computers I have become a bit of a sucker for software advertise- ments. In fact, I've been taken in by many a pitch since I gave up writing my own programs in 1982. Most recently however, I encountered an advertisement in a UFO journal that promised to deliver sortable data on over 10,000 sightings through more than 2500 years. Sighting locations were plotted on maps that could be called up at the operator's command and I couldn't be- lieve the price ($45.50 including shipping in the USA). I . sent off my check and figured I would have to wait for at least a few weeks or perhaps a couple of months. I was quite shocked when a 3 1/2 inch disk showed up in less than a week with a 29-page set of instructions. I promptly installed this on the hard disk of my 486-DX 33 notebook and have been running it since without the slightest prob- lem. In fact, this is one of the simplest programs from the user point of view that I have ever encountered. Each of the individual sightings is referenced and this makes it possible to use the database for real eval- uation studies. As Larry Hatch wrote me, \"For the last 10 years I have been turning book stores and libraries upside down for materials.\" As he indicated, he also included a substantial part of the only other computer database that existed (UFOCAT). As he pointed out, UFOCAT lacks a synopsis field and it was necessary to add the oth- er data needed. The reference list includes a total of 173 entries and I found it very useful. The package is written in C-language and runs in DOS 3.0 through 6.2. Although there is as yet no Windows version, Windows users simply switch to the UFO subdirectory and type U (Enter) from outside Windows. PAGE 18 NUMBER 322 FEBRUARY 1995"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL The product is of great use to anyone who is in- volved in UFO research at any level. Most important however, is the large number of cases sighted because this prevents researchers from being accused of drawing conclusions based on the statistics of small numbers. I got it because of my interest in the variation of UFO sightings through time and it has been extremely useful to me because the sightings can be sorted by year, month and day and they are automatically plotted as bar graphs with numerical data for each field. The quality of the screen output is excellent and Jacques Vallee called it \"simply superb.\" I strongly recommend this software to anyone in UFO research because of its scope. It is a genuine bar- gain at the price and Larry Hatch provides a phone number for customer support in the instructions. 1 must say that I have not had to test this service because of the intuitive and user friendly nature of the program.

Letters to Mufon UFO Journal DEAR MUFON: On Monday, November 28. 1994 at approximately 4:30 pm CST, I saw a UFO. I had just fed my cows and decided to sit outside for awhile because it was such a beautiful day. I was staring at the sky because there were a few big fluffy clouds that looked pink from the setting sun. I noticed a small dark object over the ridge to the southwest. At first I assumed it was a soaring Turkey Vulture, because it was moving so slowly. But then, I re- alized it had to be much larger than a Turkey Vulture for me to see it at that distance, and it was Hying straight, while Turkey Vultures soar in large circular patterns. The object was headed southeast. When it was almost due south of me, it changed direction to northeast and was now heading almost directly toward me. As it got closer, I saw that it was also descending. Even though 1 knew it wasn't a bird, I still kept waiting for it to flap its wings or hear the noise of a plane engine. When it really got close I could see that it was a dark triangular-shaped object, about the size of a large car. The sun only reflected off a small vertical strip al- most in the middle of the object, where there was sort of a small domed portion. When it was almost directly over my barn (about 100 ft. from me) I stood up and had walked about 20 ft. towards the barn when the object vanished. I couldn't believe what I had just seen and I kept looking for the object until my security light came on (about 5 minutes later), so I figured I had watched it for 15-20 minutes. Later, when I looked at a map I could tell that it had moved a total distance of about 1/2 mile. The whole time I was listening for a plane engine, but it never made any noise. After I got used to the idea that I had seen a UFO (whatever its origin), I wondered why it would come here, as it is 17 miles to the nearest town and this area could best be described as a big forest with a little pas- ture land. Then 1 remembered reading a local newspaper story (Hickman County Times) last summer about how a busi- ness called Accurate Arms (which I had always heard just made gunpowder) wanted tax breaks from Hickman County for some big expansion plans they had. The story said that Accurate Arms had been doing work for Oak Ridge and NASA, and all the expansion plans in- volved them, and that the past work was storage for one and propulsion for the other. Accurate Arms is four miles overland from my farm. On Dec. 8th I decided to drive over there, and they had put up a big security fence and gates since the last time I had driven by. Then on Dec. 9th I called a friend that drives by Accurate Arms every day to another farm he owns to feed his cows. He said he has never seen anything strange, except for military helicopters land at Accurate Arms on a regular basis, sometimes to get gas. He said that a military fuel truck would go to Accurate Arms, a helicopter would arrive, gas up, then the truck and helicopter would leave. When I was Christmas shopping the next week I saw a book about a UFO crash at Roswell. I bought it and the next day when I looked at it (I turned to the pictures first), I was stunned to see a drawing of a UFO that looked a lot like what 1 had seen. Then a couple of weeks ago, a mechanic who works nearby happened to mention that he had just finished working on a semi cab for Accurate Arms. I asked him what it was like over there and he said security was very tight with lots of guards and checkpoints, and you had to have a pass on your shirt and vehicle. There were a lot of buildings and new large concrete bunkers in hollows you can't see from the road. The Roswell book had names and addresses in it for groups that do UFO research and I would like to know what somebody else thinks about all this. Since this happened, I have been thinking about other things that I have seen or heard about in the immediate area. I just have to wonder if they are connected to what I saw or is everything just a coincidence? Where did it come from? Why was it here? Am I being paranoid about Accurate Arms? Are UFOs routinely sighted in rural areas? Why?

Reck McEwen, TN UFOS ONLINE? As a MUFON investigator for the past year, I have had an opportunity to work on a couple of local cases. Unfortunately, this county seems to be UFOless. At times I feel like the \"Maytag Repairman,\" waiting for something to do, and then I discovered Omni Magazine in America Online. Low and behold, every Monday night from 10 pm to midnight they hold a UFO Chat in the Antimatter Chat Room. People from one end of the country to the other begin scratching around the subject of UFOs. \"Wow,\" I thought, here's an opportunity to match wit, theory, and hypothesis with the nation. It was not the case. Almost every new person joining the conversation had a question: \"Did you see that strange light that was reported last night in my town?\" Sighting reports were being teletyped in faster than I could take notes. I couldn't believe the number of unsolicited re- ports, nor could I believe I was the only MUFON mem- ber listening in. Do you think it would be feasible to jump on the information superhighway and get up to speed on fast-tracking UFO reports as soon as they are sighted? Could this get us one step closer to achieving a Delta Team, a chance to arrive at a recent landing site while the ground is still warm? Better yet, beat the strange men in black to the next encounter? Well, it's just a thought. — John Lamb Field Investigator Brevard County, FL Plans are afoot for something like what you have in mind, John.

PARANORMAL Regarding \"The Paranormal Connection\" by Keith Basterfield (December 1994): Although the author cov- ers the earlier writers on this subject reasonably well, I feel obligated to point out that I wrote extensively on the matter in the 1960s and 70s. Much of my earlier work was not widely published. However, my major and final writing on this matter consisted of The UFO Connection (Jupiter Publishing, Ottawa, 1979), which is widely known by Ufologists around the world. I therefore feel justified in considering myself one of the earliest pio- neers of this particular theory when it seemed everyone else was still stuck on strictly nuts and bolts. — Arthur Bray Ottawa, Ontario Address comments and correspondence to the editor, Dennis Stacy, Box 12434, San Antonio, TX 78212.

FEBRUARY 1995 NUMBER 322 PAGE 21"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL March 1995 Bright Planets (Evening Sky): After its opposition last month, Mars, in Cancer, still shines at -0.6 magnitude in mid-March, though the red-tinted planet is gradually diminishing in brightness and apparent size as the Earth pulls away from it. Mars stands high in the E at dusk and moves westward in the S during the night. Bright Planets (Morning Sky): Venus (magnitude -4.0) rises as twilight begins and lies low in the ESE as the sky brightens. The imposing planet is in the vicinity of the lunar crescent on March 28. Mars sets in the NW at dawn. Jupiter (-2.2), in Ophiuchus, rises in the ESE about I AM in midmonth and drifts to the S by dawn. The giant world lies near the quarter Moon on the 22nd. Saturn (1.1), in Aquarius, reappears in the morning sky late in the month but is difficult to see. At that time it is very low in the E at dawn. Moon Phases: New moon—March I First quarter—March 8 Full moon—March 16 Last quarter—March 23 New moon—March 30 The Stars: During the midevening hours the N-to-S celestial meridian separates the winter heavens from the stars of spring. Astride the meridian itself in the S lies the faintest of the 12 zodiacal constellations, Cancer the Crab. This obscure pattern is most noteworthy for the faint patch of light in its center. Focus binoculars or a telescope on the object. Its true nature is re- vealed to be a V-shaped \"swarm\" of stars popularly called the Beehive. Also in Cancer this month, some 8° E of the Beehive, lies the red planet Mars. Cancer is situated between Leo the Lion and Gemini the Twins. Leo's telltale SickJe or backward question-mark clearly denotes the lion's head and mane. The bright star Regulus is Leo's heart. The Twin Stars. Pollux and Castor form the heads of the two brothers, while their stick-figure bodies and feet are rather eas- ily seen along with arms extended to the right and left. Castor actually is a triple star (telescopically), and each of the trio is itself a close pair (spectroscopically). So the entire system is composed of 6 stars!

PAGE 22 NUMBER 322 FEBRUARY 1995"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL DIRECTOR'S MESSAGE - Continued from Page 24 manual in the English-speaking nations. It is composed of 24 sections, some having several part numbers, and authored by a vast contingent of outstanding UFO re- searchers and investigators. The 311 page manual will be delivered in a 3-ring loose leaf hardback notebook. Edited by Walter H. Andrus, Jr., the manual is re- spectfully dedicated to Jerold R. \"Ron\" Johnson and Dan C. Overlade, Ph.D., for not only their personal contributions to the manual, but their individual dedi- cation to resolving the UFO phenomenon. Many of you purchased the MUFON Field Investigator's Training Guide authored by T. David Spencer, Deputy Director of Investigations, which is a terrific adjunct to the new manual for instructors as well as students. Due to the manual's size and weight, special mailing cartons were purchased for shipping. The price to MU- FON members has been set at $25 plus $3.50 for postage and handling, whereas non-current members may obtain the new manual for $35 plus $3.50 for p. and h. The same price will apply in foreign countries. May I personally thank everyone for their patience while the new manual was being produced, since it did create a hardship and handicap in conducting field in- vestigator training classes. A heartfelt thanks is also extended to all of the authors who wrote specific sec- tions for the manual. This was an accomplishment that no one person could fulfill, since each section was writ- ten by an authority in the particular field involved. I am confident that the waiting was justified. The fourth edi- tion of the manual is truly a state-of-the-art production which will make everyone very proud. RESEARCH PROPOSALS The Mutual UFO Network has joined with the Center for UFO Studies and the Fund for UFO Research in a coalition that will solicit for research proposals. The members of the coalition council will pass judgment on the proposals submitted and then fund worthy projects with monetary grants. The interest of all three groups is to move the study of UFOs more toward science using the general protocols of the scientific method. Scientific research projects will receive highest priority, followed by public education projects, and then followed by gen- eral special projects. This is an opportunity for scientists, engineers, and academics to explore ideas, theories, and studies that could lead to the resolution of the UFO enigma. Proposal forms may be secured by writing to any of the three above named organizations or to Thomas P. Deuley, 103 Oldtowne Road, Seguin, TX 78155-4099. MORTON SCHAFER'S PASSING Not only did we lose Leonard H. Stringfield on December 18, 1994, but four days later Morton Schafer, a Field Investigator and former Assistant State Director in Massachusetts (Bellingham) joined Leonard in the hereafter. Joining MUFON in 1987, Mort was 71 years of age. May we express our sorrow to his family and UFO colleagues with his passing. C.I.S. UFOLOGICAL ASSOCIATION CONFERENCE The Fourth Scientific Conference of the C.I.S. Ufological Association took place in Moscow, Russia, on October 17-28, 1994. It was attended by 250 repre- sentatives of UFO organizations from 65 Russian cities and also from the neighboring countries of Ukraine, Belorussia, Azerbaijan, Uzbekistan, and Bulgaria. The speakers emphasized the actual problems of ufology and to the formulation of the new conception of ufology and bioenergoinfomatics' paradigm. Many speakers noted the growing negative influence of the UFO phe- nomenon upon the population. Some recommendations were made for the protection of the population from these influences. The conference recommended an escalation to higher levels of scientific investigations in ufology and to im- prove the exchange of information between different ufological organizations. This new item was prepared by MUFON representatives at the Moscow UFO Center, Dr. Vladimir Ajaja and Dr. Pavel R. Popovich. 8TH INTERNATIONAL UFO CONGRESS The 8th International UFO Congress organized by the British UFO Research Association will take place at the University of Hallam, Pennine Theater, Sheffield, South Yorkshire in England during the weekend of August 19 and 20,1995.

Mr. Andrus will conduct the opening and closing ceremonies and he will be the re- cipient of a special presentation on behalf of BUFORA for his services to ufology.
