FROM THE EDITOR With this issue we pass the mark of 150 consecutive publications of the Journal (and its predecessor \"Skylook\"), an accomplishment of some note. As our International Director will confirm, it has not always been easy. Inflation, constantly rising costs of paper and printing, postal increases, and other factors have led to subscription price in- creases. On top of all this - after recently priding ourselves on a good record of on-time publication - circumstances beyond our control have put us behind schedule temporarily. Please bear with us; we are taking all steps necessary to get back on schedule and to continue upgrading the quality of articles and news reporting. I have been personally gratified by the friendly and supportive comments of the readers, but critical comments also would be helpful. With a continuing \"Mutual\" effort, we will strive to make the Journal a valuable source of information, opinion, discussion, and critical evaluation. Your participation in this process is important. In this issue SAN FERNANDO VALLEY SIGHTING WAVE, 1979.  3 By Walter H. Greenawald UFOs AND PROPHETIC RELIGIOUS MOVEMENTS  7 By Mark L.

Greenawald (MUFON Field Investigator) In early August 1979, I became aware of a singular UFO sighting in Canoga Park, Calif., reported in the San Fernando Valley Chronicle August 2nd. I contacted Sandy Sand at the pa- per inquiring if other UFO sightings had been noted. Publication of this event apparently led to other UFO wit- nesses stepping forward, although cau- tiously in some cases, and reporting other occurrences. Ultimately, this con- tact resulted in my intervew and sub- sequent involvement in this small sight- ing wave. The UFO events uncovered were mainly in the Canoga Park and Reseda area of the San Fernando Valley, a highly residential suburban area ap- proximately 25 miles NW of Los Ange- les. Through the cooperation of the Chronicle and the witnesses themselves I was able to gather information on 12 sightings (See Table). These events are spotted on a map showing relative locations. ' In two cases I have corroborating evidence from independent witnesses who stated that they did not know of the other party. After an article in the Chronicle August 9th, Shari N. called me and volunteered her story about a seemingly innocuous NL which she saw in the same time frame as the Chil- ders on July 25. During our initial dis- cussion she admitted to a time lapse and some strange physiological effects. After I explained what may have hap- pened she agreed that at least one re- gressive hypnosis session was in order. Generally, excellent cooperation was obtained from most witnesses ... only one family requested anonymity. Most other witnesses did not mind if their names were used in connection with their UFO sighting. Three cases appear to have high, validity and merit: * C ChildersNL 7/25/79 3 to 4 a.m. D Shari N. NL 7/25/79 3:15 a.m. Arrangements have been made with an experienced psychologist, skilled in hypnotic regression, and at least one session will be attempted to determine the possibility of an abduc- tion. * H Peacock NL 8/3/79 9:15 p.m. I Palmer NL 8/3/79 9:15 p.m. Corroboration of events from these two independent witnesses, unknown to each other and at significantly differ- ent sites, make this an excellent sight- ing. The fine report turned in by Mrs. Palmer allowed an estimate of size and altitude of the object to some degree of precision. * E Pearson DD 7/25/79 7:15 a.m. The multiple witnesses at one loca- tion plus the two unknown policeman make this an interesting DD case. More investigative effort will be done when time permits to learn the identi- ty of the two officers. The police, if they know anything, are not cooperat- ing. One IFO resulted ... Mrs. Nancy Zabka after reading the article in the August 16th Chronicle phoned me and gave me this account. At 10 p.m. on the 18th of August she was in her back yard and noted a strange arrangement of lights toward the SW horizon. She called others in the family to watch. They all could hear a noise like a heli- copter but couldn't make out the light pattern. Several days later she was dis- cussing this event with a neighbor who also observed the phenomena but at a different vantage point ... it turned out to be a special sign aboard a helicopter spelling out a congratulatory message over a house in Hidden Hills, an ex- clusive housing development adjacent to the Zabka's. As a result of this moderate and local sighting flap I was interviewed by the Chronicle and have agreed to author a weekly UFO column for as long as the interest is there on the part of the readers. At least there will be a local reporting center for UFO sight- ings if only temporary. Efforts will continue in a cautious evaluation of the sighting of Shari N. as there appears to be the possibility of an abduction. Childers Sighting - C Location: Canoga Park, Calif. Date: 25 July 1979 3:00 to 4:00 a.m. (Night) Witnesses: Dean Childers, 19 and a stu- dent at Pierce College; Mrs. Mickey Childers, mother and housewife; An- other family member who prefers anonymity. Sighting: Mrs. Childers was awakened by barking neighborhood dogs and got up to check on the disturbance. From her bedroom window (2nd floor) she saw a white glowing mass low in the sky over the Chatsworth Reservoir (N to NE) ... looking like a sparkler. She awakened her son, Dean, and both went outside and watched the device for some time with binoculars and a low-powered refracting telescope from the back yard. Initially, the object ap- peared to be close with an apparent size of 3/16\". No sound. Some time later the object rose to about 45 degrees elevation where the family watched for about 25 minutes. During this time frame they noted red, green, and blue blinking lights on the object, which appeared to climb to the E from a NNE direction. (Note: there is a scintillating star in the northern sky at about this position and at the (Continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"(San Fernando, continued) right time of morning.) The object continued to climb to 15,000 - 20,000 feet and then disappeared. Initially it appeared to be a white glowing spheri- cal object. Dean reported three incidents which occurred after or during the-end of the major sighting. He saw some- what peripherally three separate flashes like meteorites ... bright orange things off to the E each only lasting three seconds, about 5 minutes apart. It is not known whether these incidents were related to the major UFO seen. Shari N. Sighting - D Location: Canoga Park, Calif. Date: 25 July 1979 Time: 3:15 a.m. Duration: Several minutes Witness: Shari N. (Due to the possibility of an abduction, she shall remain in- cognito at least temporarily) Sighting: As Shari N. was driving south on Topanga Canyon at 3:15 a.m. and shortly before she came to the light at Plummer, she became alarmed at what appeared to be an airplane about to crash. Whatever it was, it was close and appeared to be hovering, no motion one way or the other. She sketched three fuzzy and adjacent white spheres. As she stopped at the light at Plummer St. she further studied the ob- ject. She even rolled the driver's win- dow down but could hear no noise. Noting that there were no other cars around and that there seemed to be a lack of street lights and housing tract illumination, she became alarmed and ran the red light and went home. During my interview the following abnormalities have emerged: * She arrived home approximate- ly Vi. hour late - her husband was waiting up for her and wondered where she had been. (Shari is a cocktail waitress in a western saloon in Chatsworth and normally the trip home takes 12 to 15 minutes; this time it was 45 minutes) * She felt nauseous for several days after * She noted large water blisters on the insides of her knees * Her western hat was on the seat next to her in the car - normal- ly she holds it in place with pins as customers try to pull it off (she uses the hat also to hold her braid wig in place). Shari is amenable to regressive hypnosis, commenting that whatever happened during that missing half SAN FERNANDO VALLEY SIGHTING FLAP; JULY-AUGUST 1979 Date Time  Location A 7/21/79 9:30-10:00 p.m. Simi Valley B C D E F G H I J 7/25/79 7/25/79 7/25/79 7/25/79 7/25/79 8/3/79 8/3/79 8/3/79 8/4/79 2:00 a.m. 3:004:00 a 3:15 a.m. 7:15 a.m. 11:00 p.m. 12:10a.m. 9:15 p.m. 9:15 p.m. 8:30 a.m. Canoga Park Bassett & Vanowen Canoga Park Platt & Saticoy Canoga Park Topanga & Plummer Canoga Park Oso & Saticoy Woodland Hills Fallbrook & Dolorosa Reseda Victory & Tampa Reseda Runnymeade & Rhea Canoga Park Corbin & Lanark Canoga Park Oso & Saticoy K 8/4/79 10:35 p.m. Canoga Park L 8/24/79 3:20 a.m. Category NL NL NL NL* DD NL NL NL NL DD Witnesses Perez family (5) 4 Unknown Teenagers Childers family (3) Shari N. 0) Pearson & 6 others (2 police) Hetman family (2) Mortillaro (2) Peacock 0) Palmer 0) George 0) CE-I Sherman Way & Milwood Canoga Park  NL Sherman Way & Royer Artura (2) Anapol 0) Description Glowing white ball with blinking colored lights, whirring noise.

From this I calculated that the diameter of the object was approx- imately 80 feet and that it was at an altitude of about 8,000 feet. The loca- tion of the object (i.e., over Corbin at Lanark) is corroborated by the direc- tion stated by Mrs. Peacock who lives about one mile to the east of Mrs. Pal- mer. Neither lady claimed that she knew the other so we can rule out complicity. Mrs. Palmer called Channel 4 (NBC) who said that they also had sev- eral other calls on UFOs that night. No follow-up was done in this area due to the large number of calls being re- ceived at the Chronicle and at home. Pearson Sighting - E Location: Canoga Park, Calif.

Several wit- nesses thought that they were taking pictures, but Peter Kim who was close to them said that they had binoculars. Several phone calls from the reporter at the Chronicle were made to local police departments, but no details were made available as to who the two policemen were.

Approaching from Topanga Canyon Blvd. in the west, she noted a round and saucer shaped craft with a plastic dome on top. Inside, she said, were two humanoid creatures with over- sized heads.

Citizens Against UFO Secrecy (CAUS; P. 0. Box 4743, Arlington, VA 22204) has filed a set of lawsuits against three federal agencies to obtain government documentation on UFOs. The suits - filed in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia on June 24, 1980 - seek to obtain information from the National Security Agency, the Defense Intelligence Agency, and the Federal Aviation Administration. Paperwork accompanying the lawsuits suggests that the United States Attor- neys are attempting to place the case with a judge whose rulings have pre- viously been favorable to the federal government. Spearheading the drive for citizen access to government UFO information is lawyer Peter A. Gersten of the law firm Rothblatt, Rothblatt & Seijas."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"UFOs AND PROPHETIC RELIGIOUS MOVEMENTS By Mark L. Moravec A prophetic religious movement is a system of beliefs and practices, held collectively by a group of people, which \"formalizes the conception of the relation between man and his envi- ronment\" (Winick's definition of reli- gion, 1961, p.454) and predicts the re- newal and improvement of the world at some forthcoming time. By examin- ing three ethnographic examples of prophetic religious movements, I will present the evidence for the view that such movements have several common elements and are more than simply re- ligious attempts to escape from reality based on misguided prophecies. Rather, the movements seem to emerge as a re- sponse to both certain social condi- tions and an \"impulse\" within human consciousness pushing human beliefs in a definite direction to produce social change. The Ghost Dance religious move- ment of the North American Indians emerged with great impact in 1890 af- ter a Paiute healing shaman called Wo- voka (\"the Cutter\") had a vision of God who ordered him to establish the new movement. All Indians must dance, everywhere, keep on dancing. Pretty soon in next spring Great Spirit come ... All dead In- dians come back and live again ... When Great Spirit comes this way, then all the Indians go to mountains ... Then while Indians .way up high, big flood comes like water and all white people die. jet drowned. After that, water go way and then nobody but Indians ev- erywhere and game all kinds thick. -Wovoka, the Paiute Messiah (Brown, 1970, p. 416). Despite the imprisonment of Ghost Dance prophets and persecution of their followers by the white men who thought the movement dangerous, it expanded to the most distant re- gions of the northwestern United States. (Lanternari, 1963). The cargo cult of the Usurufa, who lived in the area around Kainantu in the eastern highlands of New Guinea, was investigated by Robert Berndt in the 1950s when contact be- tween the Usurufa and Europeans had still been minimal. The first contact was in 1930 when the natives were ini- tially terrified by the sight of aero- planes but later believed \"the white men inside the big mother bird were friendly spirits\". (Christiansen, 1969, p. 28). Because the Europeans had red skins, they were not identified as men, but rather as spirits of the dead, re- turning with wealth in the form of quantities of European goods (cargo) which would be stored in the large warehouses the Usurufa had construc- ted. However, as the goods did not ar- rive as calculated, distrust of the Euro- peans grew. (Christiansen, 1969). The movement peaked in 1947 between Mount Hagen and the Markham River and spread beyond, with periods of disappointment and depression follow- ing excited expectation. (Lanternari, 1963). A modern counterpart is a move- ment which began in the 1950s in an industrialized city in the midwest of the U.S.A. A surburban housewife, \"Mrs. Marian Keech,\" received messa- ges via automatic writing claimed to be sent by \"superior beings from a planet called 'Clarion'. These beings have been visiting the earth in what we call flying saucers.\" (Festinger, Rieck- en and Schachter, 1964, p. 30). Through Mrs. Keech's network of friends, a movement of initially several dozen people gathered around her and became committed to the beliefs of the group's accumulating folklore. Pos- sible objective, physical manifestations which occurred include the mysterious appearance and disappearance of a \"stiff-legged entity\" at a prophesied flying saucer landing. The \"Guardians,\" as the beings came to be known, gave the group teachings and advice about religious matters and cosmology, and predicted future events, the most important event being a flood which would sub- merge the city just before dawn on December 21, accompanied by a cata- clysm which would submerge the West Coast of the Americas. Those people who drowned would be spiritually re- .born on other planets appropriate to their spiritual development, but flying saucers would come down from the sky in time to save the believers from the flood. Despite the fact that the di- sasters did not come to pass, the failed prediction reinforced the movement's conviction, because its members took credit for the avoidance of the destruc- tion! The group only disbanded when the leaders were threatened with legal action and possible commitment to a mental hospital. Common Elements The above three prophetic reli- gious movements share a number of common elements. They — (1) were dissatisfied with the social conditions which they were forced to accept; (2) rejected established authority; (3) were initiated after a prophet re- ceived revelations and prophecies from a \"higher being\"; (4) were promised a new age of en- lightenment and renewal for the world, a rebirth in paradise; and (5) were catalyzed by individuals act- ing as leader, prophet and/or mes- siah. By 1890, Indian culture was rapid- ly declining due to the unjust takeover of land and violent expulsion of the Indians by the white man. Wovoka's claim that the promised land was only for the Indians openly paved the way for the Sioux uprising. In New Guinea, the Usurufa's brief contacts with Euro- peans revealed the comparative materi- I'Continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"(Prophetic, continued) al disadvantage of the natives. Accord- ing to Christiansen (1969, p. 108), the cargo cult is a \"cult of wealth which does not merely embrace material goods, but also power, good fortune and fertility, etc., which has its roots in the traditional ideology.\" A study by Guiart and Worsley (Christiansen, 1969) found that, of 73 Melanesian cargo cults, only half had a belief in the cargo myth proper. In fact, accord- ing to this view, the cargo movements reflect more than an envious desire for European goods; they are a search for \"spiritual cargo.\" The modern flying • saucer movement was clearly uncon- cerned with material gain, refusing all offers of money. The cult members were unsatisfied with the social and spiritual conditions of modern, indus- trialized society. The Guardians com- municated with Mrs. Keech to teach her and other humans \"those princi- ples, ideas and guides to right conduct that are necessary to advance the spir- itual development of\" the human race ...\" (Festinger et al, 1964, p. 45). The Usurufa cargo cult came to regard the Europeans as a threat to safety when the cargo failed to arrive, and rifles appeared in the villages. The fly- ing saucer cult maintained its beliefs in the face of social pressure from the media and the legal authorities. The revelations which initiated the movements all have a similar con- tent. \"God instructed Wovoka to com- mand his people to work assiduously, not to steal, lie or fight, to love one another and to live at peace with the white man, even though they might still hope and pray for his disappear- ance from their midst.\" (Lanternari, 1963, p. 152). The revelation prom- ised the Indians the return of a Golden Age of plentiful buffalo and spiritual salvation. Through dreams and visions with the Spirits/Europeans, an era of freely available material and spiritual wealth was prophesied for those in the cargo movement. For those in the fly- ing saucer movement, paradise was to be their spiritual rebirth on planets with a higher level of spiritual develop- ment. The ghost dance .and cargo movements also promised the return to life of the dead ancestors. As these details show, all three movements in- clude beliefs identical to some of the beliefs of Christianity. In fact, Wovoka was identified as the Son of God by the Mormons in 1892; and the most important Guardian, called Sananda, revealed himself to be the contem- porary identity of Jesus Christ. Some Melanesian cargo cults constructed \"telegraph stations\" using dummy poles and \"lines\" of lianas to receive messages from Christ. Did these move- ments borrow Christian-like beliefs from the society they were rebelling against or did these beliefs evolve inde- pendently? It may be that the identity of Christ was incorporated into an in- dependently evolved belief system which already included a Christ-like messianic role. The \"prophet\" announces the forthcoming state of paradise, the \"leader\" directs the movement,and the \"messiah\" is believed able to make the millenial dream come true because of his divine powers (Christiansen, 1969). Wovoka, whose powers of healing were widely regarded, possessed all three roles and was probably a \"charismatic\" leader. Yet 20 years earlier in 1870, the prophet Wodziwob started the first version of the Ghost Dance after re- ceiving a revelation emphasizing the same major themes of the return of the dead, the catastrophic end of the world, and the regeneration of Indian life after the disappearance of the white man. Dr. Berndt's last survey of the Usurufa cargo cult in 1953 reveal- ed the movement still existed, being kept alive by a succession of prophets. The flying saucer cult gained a second prophet when one of. its members went into a fit and trance and relayed communications to the group from the \"Creator.\" .- - ' What these details of a succession . of prophets point out is that .the role of the prophet/leader/messiah, no mat- ter how charismatic he or she may be, is limited. Lanternari (1963) suggests there is a dialectical relationship be- tween the prophets and certain socio- logical and cultural conditions. The in- dividual prophet is not the sole cause of the movement, but a catalyst around which the group centers. Theories of Causation How do prophetic religious move- ments come about? Lanternari (1963) has suggested that many movements result from the clash between two cul- tures. The \"less advanced\" people may become aware of their economic and social lags and turn to the message of hope and salvation offered by the pro- phets (and it may well be European, exploitation and oppression within the traditional contact which promoted the search for an alternative). In con- trast, Oosterwal (Christiansen, 1969) believes that in the case of the cargo cult, the movement is traditional. It was only after the introduction of European goods that the concept of material cargo was incorporated into the belief system. Unless \"we assume a completely static historical situation it is not unreasonable to suggest that movements rather like Cargo move- ments were occurring in Melanesia before the white man came there.\" (Burridge, cited in Christiansen, 1969). Thus, while a clash of cultures may emphasize material and social differen- ces adding impetus to a movement, this clash may not be a basic cause of it. Studies of movements prior to sub- stantial Western 'contact should sup- port this conclusion, but few, if-any, such isolated movements exist these days. According to \"deprivation\" the- ory, the prophetic religious movement is only one of several responses to a state of deprivation — the despair caused by a dissatisfaction with pre- sent material and social reality when compared to the past or another cul- ture. (Barber, in Lessaand Vogt, 1972). However, this theory doesn't explain why the prophetic religious movement is the response in \"those situations in which it has manifested. It has been suggested that dissatis- faction with economic conditions is the cause of the movements..Accord- ing to Lawrence's (1964) study of a cargo cult in Medang, New Guinea, there was an obsession for cargo be- cause of economic necessity and be- cause it was an index of self-respect and status. This observation does not seem to generalize to- .other move- ments. Certainly the members of the 8"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"(Prophetic, continued) flying saucer cult wanted nothing, to do with material gain. Vallee (1976) proposes that move- ments such as the flying saucer cult come into being in response to a mechanism, possibly within human consciousness, which is pushing human beliefs from, a materialistic-oriented perspective to some level of higher awareness. This change in belief, jn turn, produces cultural change. Applying Vallee's hypothesis to the cargo cults, there is on the surface a contradiction presented by the belief in cargo. However, if we accept the hy- pothesis presented earlier, the cargo belief extends beyond solely material goods, which may have been empha- sized only after European contact with the accompanying appearance of West- ern goods. Perhaps our materialistic Western perspective has also over-em- phasized the importance of material cargo in the cult belief system. The effect of prophetic religious movements is unambiguous: social change. But is this social change posi- tive or negative? The movements often function to unify traditionally separ- ate and hostile groups as has occurred with New Guinea cargo cults in a de- fensive reaction against the Europeans. This greater solidarity leads to a more effective development of the society (Christiansen, 1969). Lanternari (1963) views the movements as posi- tive \"and progressive - paving the way for reform in the cultural, political, and social structure of society. Cohn (1961) views the movements as abnor- mal and negative and compares them to Hitler's nazi movement. In any case many authors are guilty in assuming that cultural change must follow the same pattern as that of Euro-American society. Although individuals in a movement face persecution and disap- pointments, could an ultimate benefit lie in the impact of prophetic religious movements on human consciousness? A Conclusion Prophetic religious movements are vehicles for cultural change. The basic causes are probably both internal and external — an impulse within human consciousness launching a \"new\" be- lief system in a situation where there is dissatisfaction with current social con- ditions. The movements are catalyzed by successive prophets yet manifest a system of beliefs consistent over time and geography except for minor local variations according to the history and environment of the society. Hence prophecy is not merely a foresight of trouble or a gratuitous form of error, but the means by which an impact is made on the collective consciousness of the people, thereby leading to cultural change. The move- ments are not just religious attempts to escape from reality. Their myths and dreams are \"not something that exists outside the world of reality, but represent a sort of truth and reality which, although differing from what we call reality, are not for that reason less true or less real ...\"(Burridge, cited in Christiansen, 1969, p. 91). ... Some Questions Anthropologists and sociologists do not know, everything about the movements we have been discussing. Our conclusions can only be tentative and several unresolved issues remain. What is the nature of the \"impulse\" within human consciousness which might initiate the movements? Vallee (1976) thinks it originates from the \"collective unconscious\" — Jung's c6n- cept of a universal level of the human unconscious which is the residue of all our ancestral experiences. The poten- tialities of these ancestral or archaic images can enter consciousness as \"thought-feelings\" or archetypes: the irrational patterns of thought and prim- itive feelings found in dreams, visions, and myths (Hadfield, 1974). Accord- ing to this line of thought the UFO is an archetype (see Jung, 1969). Yet Jung's \"collective unconscious\" is merely a theoretical construct and quite possibly scientifically unprovable. The point is that we may be attempt- ing to explain one unknown (the UFO) in terms of another (the archetype). (Similarly, no one has proved that extraterrestrial life exists). It seems pretty certain that pro- phetic religious movements have al- ways been around in one form or an- other. Specifically, will UFO cults con- tinue appearing? As Jacobs (1975) re- lates, the 1950s saw the growth of hundreds of contactee and contactee- orientated clubs in the U.S.A. The early 1970s bred a \"new\" type of contactee, such as Uri Geller, who claims posses- sion of psychic powers derived from UFO contact experiences. It seems that the prophets of the flying saucer cults will be with us for quite some time. Is the contactee experience separ- able from the remaining UFO picture? Alvin Lawson (1977) has been con- ducting some very interesting investi- gations of the reliability of hypnotic regression in CE-III cases. He suggests that UFO abduction- cases have \"a wholeness or integral quality (although details and duration vary) which dif- fers from other close encounters\" which are frequently interrupted by human intrusion. It could be, and has been, argued that the \"full-blown\" re- ligious contactee experience is differ- ent from the abduction cases (the lat- ter being somehow more acceptable, especially to supporters of the extra- terrestrial hypothesis). Yet both the religious (willing?) contactees and the abduction contactees go for rides in \"flying saucers\", receive esoteric cos- mic philosophies, and often subse- quently experience seemingly paraphy- sical experiences. In any case, it is im-- portant to find out whether or not the contactee experience is qualitatively different from other (more physical?) UFO experiences, since a difference may imply multiple causation (despite Occam's Razor) or, at the very least, a multiple approach (physical and para- physical) to solve the entire UFO mys- tery (I use the term \"paraphysical\" to cover both psychological and appar- ently parapsychological events). In one sense, the UFO problem reminds me of the apparent paradox of the elec- tron being both a particle and a wave. The UFO phenomenon, in totality, appears to be both physical and para- physical. Any proposed solution of the UFO mystery cannot ignore either the physical events at Socorro or the para- physical events experienced by Mrs. Keech and her followers.

The prophets who receive their psychic revelations may undergo a personality change from ordinary people to those with the \"inner glow\" brought on by reli- gious conversion. They and their fol- lowers are compelled to follow a radi- cal and complete belief system. But this is often at the cost of personal dis- tress and sometimes tragedy brought on by the experience itself and the subsequent persecution by the rest of society. In the movement centered around Mrs. Keech, several of the core members quit their jobs several weeks before the predicted disaster - which never occurred. One of the most high- ly educated in the movement, a local professor, was to say: \"I've had to go a long way. I've given up just about ever- ything. I've cut every tie. I've burned every bridge. I've turned my back on the world. I can't afford to doubt. I have to believe. And there isn't any other truth ... This is a tough time but we know that the boys upstairs are taking care of us.\" (Festinger et al, 1964). Prophetic religious movements are not the delusions of \"backward na- tives.\" They are occurring today, in our own \"highly developed\" society. At the height of the flying saucer cult, the members received literally hundreds of visitors, telephone calls, and letters from seriously interested pepple. Their ideas were not without popular appeal. REFERENCES Brown, Dee, Bury My Heart At Wounded Knee, London: Barrie and Jenkins, 1970.

Downing Prophetic religious cults involving UFOs have for some time been an em- barrassment to the scientific study of UFOs. Scientists have tried to separate themselves from the \"cult fringe.\" Mark L. Moravec's article should help take away some of our fear of the prophetic religious aspect of UFOs. He has shown that when people are in a state of deprivation, a cult of salvation often develops, sometimes stimulated by contact between a lower and higher society (Africa and Europe in regard to the Cargo cults, the American In- dians and Europeans in regard to the Indian Ghost Dance Movement). We live in an age of fear and anx- iety, especially in the face of the de- structive potential of technology. Mor- avec's paper shows that sociology and anthropology predict that UFO re- ports, in so far as they are thought to be a superior power, would automatic- ally trigger hopes for salvation especial- ly from deprived groups. So, scientists should not look at the cult side of UFOs as something we should try to hide in a closet. Rather, anthropological studies seem to pre- dict that if a higher form of reality were to appear in our skies, prophetic cults around their reality would devel- op. And they have. From my own particular perspec- tive in regard to Biblical studies, let me add these words of caution. The Bibli- cal religion believes in a world of pro- phets: false and true. Thus, although the prophets in Moravec's study all pro- duced false prophecies of a flood, the Bible maintains the view that Noah was a prophet who called the shot on the nose. The meaning of this caution is that in our scientific approach to the prophetic religious cults, our tempta- tion may be to say that while the cults are worthy of study, we cannot expect much truth to emerge from them. Be- ware that among all those cult groups, there may be a Noah. It is possible that UFOs are caused by a higher reality, one that we might even call Divine. And this divine reali- ty may indeed have its prophets. Good science is always open to the unlikely, though of course it is rightly skeptical of the unlikely. Jung, Carl G.

A dozen check-ins are us- ual on the 40-meter section, and four or five on the 75-meter net. Recent UFO sightings in upstate New York were reported on the early section run by Joe Santangelo, N1JS, MUFON's Amateur Radio Director, by KB2DP, Winnie. Her feminine voice is a wel- come change,on the net, and cuts nice- ly through the seasonal background of lightning static. Anomalous nocturnal light sightings have been frequent over North Carolina, according to Ray, K4HXC, although little is being report- ed from other parts of the country. An analysis of reports in that state shows an increase of 100% over last year. About 25% of the cases were daylight sightings, and most of the UFO activity has been along fault lines. One mystery often leads to anoth- er. Such has indeed been the case with the UFO movie shown by the Air Force to select groups of radar special- ists during the 1950's. Len Stringfield's report of this movie was described in an article, \"Hams on the Trail of UFO's,\" published in the April 1980 issue of 73 Magazine. Shortly after reading it, an amateur operator with a fascinating story checked into the 40- meter net to contact the author. Al- though his subsequent disclosure is still under investigation, Journal readers may be able to supply additional in- formation which would be helpful. Matt Archer, as we will call him, runs an electronics business today in a small midwestern town. From 1961 to 1963,he performed radio maintenance at the Atomic Proving Ground. He also did some top-secret radio work for the Air Force at times. \"Area 51\" was lo- cated 60 miles due east of the base camp, behind a mountain range which separated it from Yucca Flat. Under highest security, an operation was con- ducted there under the code name PROJECT REDLIGHT. Archer pre- sented a body of evidence strongly sug- gestive that this project involved flight- testing of a UFO which had been ship- ped there from -Edwards Air Force Base. The craft was not conventionally powered, but flew silently. Radios in good operating condition often \"just died for no reason,\" only to begin working again as suddenly. Although security men always escorted him in- side and out of view of the runway whenever IT, as they referred to the craft, was about to take off or land, he heard no engine noise of any kind. Once he saw the craft on the ground at a distance of about half a mile. It was 20 to 30 feet in diameter, he estima- ted, and pewter-colored, lacking any wings or tail. A friend of Archer's was a radar operator at a station near Tonopah, Nevada. He confided that he often ob- served UFOs over the test site, but was told to ignore them. One was described which crossed the screen completely in three revolutions of the antenna, an extraordinary velocity. All work on this project stopped suddenly in 1962. Archer remembers reading an article, in Reader's Digest, he believes, which described a UFO exploding over eastern Nevada after crossing the U.S. from the east coast. He assumed that it might have been the craft being tested, since the date given in the article was around the time when PROJECT REDLIGHT came to a halt. As yet, this article has not been substantiated, however, Ar- cher also believes that the craft he saw may have been the undamaged UFO shown in the Air Force movie, which intelligence sources cited in the String- field disclosure said had been reco- vered after crashing in New Mexico in 1952. Archer was familiar with the tur- bojet fan-driven experimental disc tested at nearby Nellis Air Force Base during this period. Coincidentally, this was pictured on the front cover of The MUFON UFO Journal for February 1980. This was not the craft he ob- served, nor would it have flown silent- ly, if indeed it had flown. He thinks that this \"non-flying saucer\" may have been a cover-up for the real UFO re- search being conducted in Area 51.

He hopes that Freedom of Information Act probing or corrob- oration by other witnesses will bring out the true story, which has been briefly summarized here. Until that happens, it remains, of course, only an unsubstantiated but highly interesting tale. Unfortunately, not every Satur- day session of the MUFON nets leads to such information. Aside from the fellowship and keeping up to date about happenings in the UFO field 12 which checking in regularly engenders, the amateur radio nets definitely ac- complish something of substance even during periods of low UFO activity, as this story confirms. News of MUFON activities in the San Antonio area and an occasional message from Director Walt Andrus is relayed from Elmer, WA5CTJ by Dr. Will Armstrong, WONC, in St. Louis. WONC is also a mainstay of the 75-me- ter net and acts as liaison between the two sections.

Various colored lights went on and off and blue vapor came from side exhaust ports. It changed from a silhouette to .an object so brightly lit that he could -hardly see its shape. This happened not once, but three times in 1973. So reported Dave McCready, associated with the Air Force for over 30 years. Dave had been in the Air Force from 1942 to 1945. He then worked as Assistant Fire Chief for Travis Air Force Base, Calif., for another 28 years, including 5 years in the Azores. Though he lived in Vacaville, Calif., he and his family owned property south of Dinsmore in northern Califor- nia. Dinsmore is in Humboldt County, 50 miles east of Fortuna, 120 miles west of Red Bluff on Highway #36, and 75 miles west of Platina. The town is a small lumber community with a gas station, country store, and a bar. Their piece of land, approximate- ly 3 miles south of Dinsmore, had been private property and most of the timber had been harvested by 1975. The terrain is hilly, with a ravine, and is sparsely covered with trees. They had a trailer situated there and often used it as a hunting camp. Nearby was a 1100 Watt generator to service the refrigerator and lights for the trailer, providing some convenience for tired hunters. On this particular September in 1973, Dave and five friends were camped on the site in the trailer. About 10:30 p.m. he stepped outside and immediately noticed a beam of white light shining on the tallest tree - an \"old snipe\" which was across a ra- . vine and about 200 to 250 yards from him. An \"object\" was hovering silently over the tree. Dave was quite .familiar with the terrain. The hill on the left sloped down gradually to the right, with random trees along the crest and Paul Cerny during NASA Mission Control Tour, 1980 MUFON UFO Symposium. the big tree down hill. The object was 75 to 100 feet above the trees, with a light beam shining from the lowest edge down onto the tree. The defined beam was about 4 or 5 feet wide and was definitely not a spotlight. The light, he judged, was just plain white — not a high-intensity light. The light then went out and the dome-shaped outline of the craft was revealed by its silhouette. A line of eight or ten blue jets suddenly appeared as if on an even platform, looking like exhaust ports, similar to a blue ex- haust from an airplane - continuous. About 10 to 15 seconds after the single beam of light on the tree went out, he noticed a bar of dim light in the shape of an inverted angle on the surface of the dome. The two ends, starting from the base of the -dome, diagonally, met at the top center of the dome. In about fifteen seconds the angled bar of light went from dim to very bright, all one light, he noted, fill- ing in the area. Then it decreased in in- tensity, faded and went out, and he could see better. Suddenly the lower beam of light came on again, moving over the sur- face area of the tall tree, not in a wide angle -just moving around the tree. It went through this repeating procedure, the lightbeam faded and the angled bar of.light came on dimly. There appeared to be a sequential pattern and he knew what to look for .the second time on the exhaust ports. Did they go off or stay on all the time? He wasn't sure, because, in the bright intensity of the light on the dome, he could hardly see the exhaust. He was fascinated, watch- ing the strange procedure from this un- known object. He watched as the object com- pleted the second sequence of events (Continued on next page) 13"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"(Hunter, continued) FIELD-INDUCTION MAGNETOMETER and began a third time. By then he was watching closely. He moved back and forth, 20 or 30 feet each way - 50 feet altogether - looking at it from different vantage points. He realized that perhaps he was seeing a UFO. It wasn't anything like any aircraft the military had, he was positive, based on his experience in the Air Force. He was aware that there seemed to be no noticeable sound, possibly because he was standing near the 1100 Watt gen- erator. Moving from one side to the other of where he had originally sighted the light, he watched it closely as it went through the \"sequence\" a third time. He wished the rest of the men were there with him. He ran to the trailer, pounded on the door, and yelled to the men to come out, that he wanted to show them something unusual. They came running out the door and followed him to the spot. There was nothing! It was gone - absolutely gone! No sign of anything. Possibly his yelling and pounding had alerted the object of impending danger. The next day they crossed the ravine to examine the tree and the ter- rain. They found nothing on the ground and apparently nothing had happened to the tree, at least nothing that was apparent. Strange that this hovering object, at least 40-50 feet across and 12-15 feet high, would leave no evidence of having been there, and he had no witnesses, as well as no answers. He related the experience to his family, but told no one else. Strangely enough at about that same period of time there were multiple ob- jects sighted over the city of Vallejo, where Dave lived with his family in their home. Forty or more people, Dave noted, were involved this time, including police officers. But they were not as close as 200 feet. He thought little more about it until 4 years later when he and his wife were watching a television show on the subject of UFOs. Suddenly he said to his wife, \"That's what I saw! That's exactly what I saw!\" It was an illustration on the TV as seen by a man named Bill Pecha from Colusa, Califor- By G. A. Pennington (Project VISIT, P. O. Box 877, Friendswood, TX 77546) Over the past several years, many UFO incidents have been accompanied by magnetic disturbances which affect compasses, automobile tape decks, air- craft instruments, etc. In an effort to detect and render these effects more visible for analysis, various types of sensing devices have been proposed and in some cases used in a limited manner by UFO researchers. In gener- al, these devices work by recording changes in the local geomagnetic field which occur during UFO passage. Since changes in the geomagnetic field are the basis for operation of some of these detectors and hence UFO detections, it is appropriate to consider the changes which can be expected by natural causes. In a paper presented by William H. Hunkins at the 1971 Midwest UFOConference.it is stated that deviations over 5% are rare for even the most extreme natur- ally caused transient disturbances, such as magnetic storms linked with solar activity. Utilizing his numbers of 50,000 to 60,000 gammas for the geomagnetic field, this 5% deviation would amount to approximately 3,000 gammas. Now for most cases, the fields in question can be considered to obey the inverse cube of the distance from the source relationship with re- spect to field intensity. Hence, dis- tance rapidly attenuates the field ef- fects and localizes any disturbances. Obviously, from the above discus- sion, very sensitive instruments such as proton free precision magnetometers would be required to detect disturban- ces from a great distance. However, since it has been suggested by other' UFO researchers that a UFO field is on the order of as much as 100,000 gam- nia. Since then he has thought a lot more about his sighting of that still unidentified flying object. Contacting this investigator was the next step, resulting in this interest- ing report of a close encounter by a re- putable witness. mas, good results can be obtained us- ing inexpensive homebuilt magneto- meters as described herein. In addition, though less expensive, the field-induc- tion magnetometer is faster than a pro- ton magnetometer by a factor of about 1,000. Shown in Figure 1 is a field-induc- tion magnetometer designed to have its sensor mounted vertically on the exterior of a building. The actual sen- sor is comprised of a 61 cm. long mu- metal (or soft iron alloy with equiva- lent magnetic permeability) bar that serves as a flux concentrator for two wire coils. The larger of the two coils (LI) is a 16 KHz horizontal oscillator coil slipped over the bar and posi- tioned at its center. It should be pointed out that other types of coils may be used as long as they contain greater than 5,000 turns of wire. The effect of a smaller number of turns will directly affect the sensitivity of the detector. As designed here, changes of 1,000 gammas in the geomagnetic field can be detected if local condi- tions permit. The second coil (L2) consists of 30 turns of No. 24 enamelled wire in- sulated from and wound over the main coil. Coil L2 is used to induce a vol- tage across LI for testing. Signals in- duced across LI are amplified by OA1. OA1 is a standard 301A operational amplifier. When the TEST switch SI is depressed, capacitor Cl discharges through potentiometer\"R3 and Coil L2, inducing an EMF in main sensing coil LI. Potentiometer R2 is used to adjust the sensitivity threshhold. The ampli- fied signal is indicated on meter Ml. It should be noted that if the geomag- netic field variations produced by a UFO also vary in flux density at some constant frequency f, a steady-state EMF will be induced in proportion to f and Ml will continually register. Be-, cause the magnetic field characteristics for UFOs are still largely unknown, it is recommended that the instrument 14"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"be initially operated in the PEAK mode as discussed later in this paper. The signal at the output of OA1 is also passed via TRIGGER' LEVEL po- tentiometer R7 to the gate of SCR 1. When SCR1 fires, it activates alarm Al. Since the power source is dc, Al will remain on even after the triggering sig- nal has passed. Normally closed RE- SET pushbutton S4 must be momen- tarily depressed to silence the alarm. It should be noted that the alarm will continue to be activated repeatedly if the detected object is still present. Two modes of signal detection are provided by PEAK/NORMAL switch S2. In the NORMAL mode, meter Ml will continuously show the signal value output from OA1 when the detected object is present (if UFO flux is vari- able) and will return to null afterwards. In the PEAK mode, the strongest out- put level from OA1 will remain dis- played on meter Ml until the charge on capacitor C3 leaks off. For this rea- son C3 is selected to provide for the best low leak characteristics. The charge can be dissipated on C3 at any time by momentarily selecting the NORMAL mode. Two scales are provided on Ml for OA1 output level, so as to provide increased granularity of the detected signal due to large or small field varia- tions induced in LI. These scales are selected by HI/LO switch S3. Operating power is obtained from a line operated, regulated 12 volt dc supply. If line power should fail, B2, a back-up 12.6 volt battery supply will operate the unit. Silicon diodes D3 and D4 provide for keeping the bat- tery voltage slightly lower than the regulated power supply voltage and thus allow its use only if line power should fail. The unit is turned on via ON/OFF switch S5. LED will illumi- nate when power is applied via the reg- ulated power supply only, as it would quickly aid in draining B2 when in bat- tery-only operation.

She had spoken with, the Sunn Classics office, who told of Sunn asking the Air Force if they could shoot the movie on an air force base. The answer was such a violent \"NO!\" that they felt they had touched a sensitive spot. However, they discov- ered an abandoned air force base at Big Spring, Texas, and the film was made on location there.\"You wouldn't believe the roadblocks put in the way of production by the Air Force,\" said Sunn. \"Hangar 18\" opened on the west coast in August, and will be re- leased throughout the rest of the coun- try in January. Mildred also provided me with a list of the actors, who are not big stars but do a fine job. I am grateful for her help. Straightforwardly told with no artistic frills, the movie is packed with excitement and suspense, and I en- joyed every minute of it. Briefly, three astronauts launching a satellite en- counter a UFO. One does not sur- vive. Radar at NASA traces its flight to the southwest United States. It is an election year, and as soon as the Presi- dent and his advisor are informed that the Air Force is in possession of a fly- ing saucer they decide to stop at nothing to hush up the event and keep the news from the public. The astro- nauts realize they are being manipu- lated and their lives ruined, so, taking matters into their own hands, they rush to locate the craft and prove its existence to the world, thus saving their honor and demonstrating the truth. Meanwhile the machine and its occupant, hidden on an air force base in Hangar 18, are being examined by a team of experts. Their discoveries and amazingly rapid deductions (after all, it UfOS SICBtTS* 1 p J\" f A ng- olion pc'iiid \"HQrigoi lc \". this is a movie) alternate with the ruth- less pursuit of the heroes (astronauts) by the villains (FBI), and the action builds to a satisfactory climax. A more explicit description would spoil your fun, but interesting ques- tions arise from the thrills. Is the story based on a real incident or combina- tion of incidents, and if so which ones? Does any evidence exist that the Feds have been authorized to kill wit- nesses to shut them up, and that this has indeed been done? If so, who gave the order? Which President? Any com- ment on these points, or others, would be welcome. It is evident that UFOs are now a popular subject, and we may expect some imaginative books and movies. Mildred reports that \"The Ogden Enigma,\" just out, is a fictional tale based on a real UFO incident. As long as they announce themselves to be fic- tion, as does \"Hangar 18\" (\"any re- semblance to actual persons or places is purely coincidental\"), the public may not confuse the fictional with the actual, but since the subject is the way it is, no doubt confused concepts will result.  — Barbara Mathey MUFON is working on a special report on UFO abduction cases, to in- clude reports from 1971 through 1980.

PRESS, Howell, MI - March 26, 1980 Closely encountered UFOs return yet again to busy Fowlerville sky Fowlcrville A UFO has again invaded the quiel skies over Livingston County. The latest reported sighting was at Marsh and Sober Roads, about 8 miles north of Fowlerville, shortly after 10p.m. on the night of March 19. Linda Hough was watching TV when she heard a loud sound outside, \"like a noisy car,\" she says. \"I looked out and there was a huge light in the sky above Marsh Road.\" \"I didn't have my contact lenses on so I took the binoculars outside to look at it better,\" she explained. \"It was skimming along just above the trees and the light was so bright it lit up the sky.\" Linda wanted to try to see the shape of the UFO so she went back indoors and put On her contact lenses. The object was still in the sky when she went back out \"I watched it cruise along,\" she said. \"I thought at first it was a plane, but there were three planes in the sky and one of them passed right over it, and the plane was so small\" (in comparison) She described it as having a \"whole bunch of lights, maybe some red ones, but the white lights were brighter.\" It reminded her of search lights and lit up the sky \"like a glow.\" \"I've never seen anything like it in my life,\" she says She described the noise as \"realh loud, louder than a jet. and it vihrateil Ihc air.\" Linda watched the object for aboui fifteen minutes, until it was almost nu: of sight, headed west toward Lansing. Then she realized how frightened she was and went inside and locked thi doors. She was home alone with her young son. \"1 called my aunt next door to see if she had seen anything, but she- had been asleep and my cousins weren't home. The neighbors on the other side weren't home either.\" Linda watched (he sky until her husband came home from work a short time later. He hadn't seen anything in the sky and neither had Linda's parcnl.- when they returned home from a movie. Does Linda Hough believe in UFOs'' \"Yes, I believe in UFOs I think there is something in outer space. I don't think they're threatening; they're jusl curious like we are. I think they're just curious about what is here on Earth as we are curious about all the other planets. They aren't here to hurt us,' she says.

JOURNAL, Muscatine, Weird light is sighted By DAVE DeWITTE Staff writer \"It made the hairs stand up on back of my neck. I know somebody's up, there looking down, and I'd like to know who it is.\" Mrs. Fred Birch, who has a \"gorgeous, panoramic\" view of the Mississippi River from her home south of Keithsburg, may be more wary about looking outside'from now on. When she first glanced out the kitchen window at around 9 o'clock Thursday evening Mrs. Birch thought she saw a \"funny bright light\" and didn't think too much of it. But after her husband had left for his night-shift job. she noticed it was still there, and took a harder look. \"I said to my son, 'that isn't a star; it's got a goldish cast to it/ \" Mrs. Birch recalls. Later she awakened her daughter to take a look at it, and telephoned neighbors. What she saw hovering over Mapes Island in the Mississippi River was something gold, possiblywith<a red spot on it. about 3-4 times as bright as the brightest star visible. It hovered above the island for nearly an hour. \"It would move a little to the right and a little to the left, but basically stay in \"\" same spot,\" she said. Aft er about an hour, the light began '°wering through trees on the island ' '1 IA - March 21, 1930 realized it was something quite different.\" she recalls. \"If it h.id stayed there hovering 1 would have kept my mouth shut. I hope I never set* it again.\" Mrs. Birch was so captivated by what she thought she was seeing that she called neighbors. \"I said, you know I don't drink, but I want you to look at what I'm seeing across the island and tell me what I see is there.\" She called Mrs. Walter Wolfe, who saw it also. Their sons went down to the levee, where they watched the light move west across the Mississippi into Iowa The boys used binoculars They said many smaller lights resembling small aircraft could be seen in the sky also. A part-time Keithsburg deputy reportedly saw the light, as did others although their accounts were not as complete. Rock Island sheriff's authorities said a report March 11 came' in at approximately the same time of night Two teenagers, Julie Smith, rural Reynolds, and Michael O'DoneU, An- dalusia, reported a very different looking object in the night sky. The two were driving on a gravel road east of Reynolds when they saw something ajwut as big as a two-car garage. The object, which was sketched by O'Donell, was rounded on the bottom and squared off at the top A Rock Island County deputy who was on patrol the same night reported seeing a bright light in the sky \"at about the same time.\" More UFOs Reported In Carolina Skies By WAYNE NICHOLAS Obwrttr Glll«fH« Bureau LINCOLNTON — George Fawcett. Lincolnton's 59-year-old unidentified flying object (UFO) expert. had planned to spend last Wednesday night resting. Instead his phone rang off the hook. An x-ray technician, who didn't want her name used because she feared people would think she was crazy, had spent five minutes on her way home that afternoon, watching what she thought was a UFO maneuver around the Burke County skies near Val- dese. \"I was playing the radio and singing to the top of ny lungs/* toe woman suA, \"when, suddenly the radio got full of static.\" The woman told 1'awcoit (and laicr a reporter) that she leaned over to hit thf car radio to srvil she could make it work. Wh'-n .she did, something red in the sky caught her eye. It was aoout 5:20 p.m. Wednesday. She said she pulled her car off to the side of the. road, looked again and .saw a large, soup-bowl- shaped UFO hovering Irs.s thjii a mile a«,a\\. \"It was about the size of a four-room house,\" she said. The technician said the ohji-rt didn't have any windows, but on the bottom was a large red rectan- gle, which looked larger than a door. \"It was the color of a shining candy apple,\" she said. She said she watched it slowly maneuver for about five minutes until it started to disappear in the distance. \"People are going to think I am crazy,\" she said over and over. \"But I know what I saw.\" Fawcett, who teaches a course in UFOs at the Lincolnton campus of Gaston College, says he's been swamped with new reports of flying saucers ever since April 29. when The Observer printed a story asking people to notify him of unusual sightings. Most reports have come from Gaslon, Lincoln and Catawba counties, he said. Pete Link and Jeff Schlatter, two Rutherford County carpenters, called Fawcett to report they were working on the roof of a house near Lake Nor- man at 9 p.m. April 24 when a bright object rose ver- tically in the sky, made a loop and disappeared. Fawcett said UFO skeptics have said flying sau- cer reports increase dramatically whenever they re- ceive publicity, but Fawcett, who has studied flying saucer reports for 30 years, says that's not always true. Studies have shown that people see UFOs regu- larly with or without publicity, he contends. \"All the articles do is to get people who would normally be hesitant to talk about their experiences to come forward.\" Fawcett said. Fawcett, who is doing a paper on the reactions of people to UFO reports, said people who see flying saucers may run into difficulty (rom their friends when they tell what they've seen. \"Some people actually get mad when you tell them you've seen a flying saucer,\" Fawcett said. And that's one of the reasons he wants people to call or write him about their experiences. He promises a sympathlc ear. SeenAlFO?

An article by Bob Pratt in the July 29 issue profiles Ted Phillips and his study of UFO landing trace cases. There have now been nearly 2,000 such cases in 64 countries. In some instances, the evidence suggests that objects weighing 8 to 10 tons (or more) have caused the traces. The August 5 issue out- lines the research of Dr. Harold Heaton, who is studying cases involving animals' reactions to UFOs. James Oberg's \"UFO Update\" column in the August issue of OMNI deals with the UFO sighting reports of Kenneth Arnold, who began the \"flying sauc- ers\" uproar with his reported sighting in 1947. Arnold claims to have seen UFOs on other occasions since then, so this brands him a \"repeater,\" according to Oberg, who quotes Dr. J. Allen Hynek as saying that so-called \"repeaters\" are \"utterably unreliable.\" While it is probably true that Hynek made such a state- ment, that certainly does not mean that it should be accepted (by Oberg or any- one else) as being valid. Oberg also errs in saying that \"all (Arnold's) UFOs look- ed the same.\" On the contrary, one of the nine objects reported by Arnold in 1947 was quite different from the other eight. His later sightings were of objects with varying descriptions. Oberg also reports on UFOs and the U.N., following the ouster of Grenada's former Prime Minister, Sir Eric Gairy. Another Oberg article is found in the September issue of FATE. In this one, he \"disposes\" of various stories about UFOs on the Moon, enigmatic lunar forma- tions, etc. While there has been a great deal of nonsense written on this topic (es- pecially regarding astronauts and UFOs), it is easy to sense a bit of \"overkill\" iri this attempt to write off some things which have genuinely puzzled lunar ob- servers. The many reports of TLP (Transient Lunar Phenomena) contain details which are not so easily explained as natural phenomena. The September issue of PROBE has an article by Dr. J. Allen Hynek, \"The Legion of the Bewildered Silent,\" as well as Allan Hendry's \"UFO Update\" col-, umn. It is understood that PROBE has now ceased publication, which is not sur- prising, in view of the types of articles carried in recent issues. It is unfortunate that all the issues could not have matched the quality of the \"Collectors Edition\" • which was released several months ago. Anyone who has not yet obtained a copy of THE ZETA RETICULI INCI- DENT by Terence Dickinson has missed some excellent information on the re- search done by Marjorie Fish on the \"star map\" allegedly seen by Betty Hill while on board an alien spacecraft. The publication is a reprint of Dickinson's 1974 article in ASTRONOMY magazine, along with all subsequent material pub- lished in that magazine which dealt with the article. Dickinson has now authored a four-page \"update\" on the map, which discusses the various criticisms by Carl Sagan and others. Both the booklet and update are available from Stanton Fried- man at the following address: UFORI, Box 958, Houlton, ME 04730. The price is $3.00 for both items. Well worth your time and money.

McKay, MUFON Regional Director for Canada, was an invitational conference held at the Metro-Toronto Reference Library, 789 Yonge St., Toronto, Ontario, on March 22, 1980. The theme or topic of dis- course was directed toward current re- search, educational endeavors, and as- pirational goals of organizations and individuals dedicated to scientific stu : dies and a rational approach to Un- identified Flying Objects or related disciplines. An invitation to participate was extended to those people in southern Ontario who had demon- strated in the past an active concerned interest in this subject matter. In Mr. McKay's introductory speech,-he related that the UFOlogist as a researcher or field investigator is faced with many difficulties when deal- ing with a transient phenomenon and the attendent disciplines. Two such as- pects were enlarged upon by Henry during his brief address, supported by a slide and pictorial display, which ex- amined the need for a broader under- standing as to the complexity of land- ing trace cases and the problems in re- solving photographic evidence. These could be misinterpretations of common causes, a perpetrated hoax, or a true graphic display of a still unidentified anomaly captured on film. He recom- mended three books of divergent in- terest to the participants, two by Ca- nadian authors; \"The UFO Connec- tion\" by Arthur Bray residing in Otta- . wa; \"UFO-Sightings, Landings and Ab-\" ductions\" by Yurko Bondarchuk; and W.H. Bowart's \"Operation Mind Con- trol.\" OtherTpeakers were David Haisell, author of the paperback book \"The Missing Seven Hours\" and editor of the quarterly publication JOURNAL UFO, who outlined some of the work of UP.

Larry Fenwick and Joe Muskat, both officers of CUFORM, Inc. of Wil- lowdale, Ontario, gave a presentation on trie investigations of a reported en- counter incident involving a number of local people. The publisher of RES BUREAUX BULLETIN, known as \"Mr. X /' outlined his experiences del- ving into and uncovering important documentation pertaining to Canadian government involvement. Mr. McKay and his colleagues are to be commend- ed for conducting this one-day UFO Conference, whereby the participants could personally meet and share their investigative experiences in helping to resolve this perplexing enigma.

John has done a magnificent job of expressing his personal views on this controversial subject and has made definite recommendations to existing UFO organizations as to their future action. John personally feels that the answers to the UFO phenomenon are contained in this manuscript. He not only reviews the status of UFOlogy today, but delves into the positive and negative aspects of Christianity and the UFO as a new perspective from the Bible and projected into the future.
