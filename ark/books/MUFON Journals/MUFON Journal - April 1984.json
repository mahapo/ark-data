A number of MUFON members see no reason why Phil Klass and his cohorts should be given valuable space in the Journal. Over the years, Klass and other debunkers have received a fair share of knocks in the Journal and, at the same time, they have usually had their say=as well. Now, however, we have a growing file of letters to and from Klass, and, unfortunately, much of it is in the \"you misunderstand what I said when you said that I said that you said that I said that...\" Trying to figure out what is going on can be a dizzying process. So, for a while, at least, Klass is out. However, using the mighty power of the editor to get in the last word, we direct you to Jennie Zeidman's statement on Page 15. *** We welcome back artist Brian Parks and a newcomer, Simone C. Mendez, a young Air Force enlisted woman stationed in Nevada. Parks' work has appeared in the Journal before. Miss Mendez, whose sketches appear on Page 5 and 6, also contributed the striking photo of the famous Air Force Thunderbirds aerial team that appears on the cover.  , In this issue THE SCIENTIFIC CHALLENGE OF UFOS   3 By James M.McCampbell THE BIG PICTURE  •.

McCAMPBELL Copyright « 1984 by James M. McCampbell The subject of UFOs is extremely complicated. It contains a wealth of material, for historians, psychologists, sociologists, statisticians, and scientists, even exhibiting such paranormal aspects as instant disappearances and telepathic communication. While hard to locate, there exists a tremendous amount of information on the subject. The available data bank far exceeds what the average person would even imagine. At least 150,000 cases of UFO sightings have been reported, most of them having been collected in a computer file at the Center for UFO Studies in Chicago. The cases range from insignificant but unidentified lights in the night sky to landed craft from which small people emerged. This data comes from worldwide sources over the past 35 years or so, representing a vast spectrum of linguisitc, cultural, and educational background of the witnesses. While there is a continuing need for further details about current UFO observations, there comes a time in any scientific enquiry when one has accumulated sufficient data to undertake the next step. And that step is analysis. A promising approach to probing the UFO enigma is to take the statements of witnesses at face value then, concentrating upon the phenomenon itself, to break it down into categories that characterize the entire subject. One can detect such threads woven through the whole tapestry. Table 1 summarizes them. Flight characteristics are decidely unique; no' conventional aircraft can come close to duplicating the performance of UFOs. They hover without the noise and downwash that would be expected. Extreme accelerations and right-angle turns startle the witnesses. Even at very high speeds, they do not produce sonic booms. Table 1. UFO Characteristics PERFORMANCE Levitation Extreme Acceleration Right-Angle Turns No Sonic Booms Unique Propulsion ATMOSPHERIC EFFECTS Surrounding Clouds Colored Halos Dazzling Brightness Luminous Tails & Clouds LANDING SITES Pungent Odors Baked Earth Charred Organic Matter Fires ELECTRICAL INTERFERENCE Internal Combustion Engines Automobile Headlights Radio & Television Power Transmission PHYSIOLOGICAL RESPONSES Humming & Beeping Body Heating Paralysis Electric Shock Sunburn Loss of Hair Induced Emotions ANIMAL REACTIONS Fear & Panic Paralysis All the other categories in Table 1 that are discussed below represent interactions of UFOs with the environment as a whole. UFOs deliver energy into the atmosphere producing several observable effects. Clouds are both produced and evaporated. Atmos- pheric gases near their surfaces glow in colored halos that change according to the acceleration, implying a connection with the propulsion system. A dazzling brightness such as a plasma adhering to the surface frequently obscures direct observation of the object. • Luminous tails and softly glowing clouds at landing sites gradually fade as if energy stored in the atmosphere were slowly dissipated as visible radiation. Evidence of simple mechanical origin left at landing sites includes crushed vegetation, broken tree limbs, and imprints of landing pads with skid- preventing nibs. In addition, reports describe pungent odors, baked earth, charred organic matter, and burning bushes or asphalt road surfaces. A great variety of electromagnetic interference has occurred. Approximately 450 cases involved disruption or stoppage of internal combustion engines. In many of them, headlights also failed. Radio • and television interference is common with or without loss of electricity in power transmission systems. A research group in West Germany has collected and computerized over 1,000 cases of electromagnetic interference of all kinds 1 . Many types of electromagnetic devices have responded to UFOs, namely, radars, telephones, batteries, speedometers, compasses, ammeters, tape recorders, loudspeakers, doorbells, streetlights, and smoke detectors. This is a large body of data that needs to be analyzed. The human body also responds to UFOs. While the sounds of conventional aircraft are notably absent, humming and beeping are heard. The body may become uncomfortably hot and the skin burned. People are cometimes paralyzed, frozen in their tracks, without disruption of vision, breathing or heartbeat. An initial apprehension or fear in the witness may be transmitted into an inexplicable calmness and sense of wellbeing. Animals also react to the presence of UFOs by exhibiting fear or panic. That behavior may be more than a (continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"THE BIG PICTURE By WALT ANDRUS Solving the UFO phenomenon is no longer a pastime for hobbyists and so-called \"UFO Buffs.\" Documents released under the Freedom of Information Act prove beyond doubt that every known intelligence agency within the United States Government has been involved to various degrees in the investigation, collection of data, studies, correspondence, meetings, etc. on unidentified flying objects or \"flying saucers.\" Yes, our government is more interested in UFOs than they would have led us to believe. With the passage of the amended Freedom of Information Act by Congress in 1974 and becoming effective February 19, 1975, serious UFO researchers have had access to over 4,000 documents from our intelligence agencies that dispel previous USAF public statements on UFOs. The 4,000 released documents could be only the tip of the iceberg. Citizens Against UFO Secrecy (CAUS), through their attorney Peter A. Gersten, has filed suits against both the CIA and NSA for additional documents that have been identified, but the courts have declined to authorize .their release \"for security reasons.\" This search should continue unabated. The possibility exists that Congress could enact other FOIA amendments or laws to forbid access to UFO documents, thus quashing, this valuable source. It would be interesting to know how many of our aerospace companies and research foundations have research and development contracts for propulsion systems, air frames and theoretical studies that could be applied directly to the construction of a device or a machine that has the flight characteristics of a UFO. Some of our MUFON consultants and research specialists have done some very fine work in this respect, on their own time, without the benefit of government funding. It should be apparent to our membership that the study of the UFO phenomenon is not just a hobby. I believe that the order issued by the Inspector General of the Air Force to every Air Base Commander on December 24, 1959, titled \"UFO's SERIOUS BUSINESS\" and the title motivation for Frank Edward's book \"Flying Saucers - Serious Business\" is even more applicable in 1984. • If MUFON is to continue to be one of the leading UFO organizations in the world, this cannot be accomplished by sitting on our hands and allowing a few\" vocal debunkers to attempt to, destroy our goals, that could effect the future of mankind, not only on this Earth but in space. We have a much larger responsibility to our fellow man than listening to snide remarks that are designed to discourage us. We must (continued on next page) McCampbell, continued normal reaction to something unusual as some pets have been paralyzed at the same time as their owners. Much progress could be made in understanding this data if specialists would collect the case histories containing certain effects in which they are expert. Then careful study should reveal the precise physical mechanisms that produce the reported effects. After a potential mechanism has been identified, it can be verified or denied by experiment. Then the traditional interplay between theory and experiment will converge upon the truth that is presently so elusive. When one has a simple solution to a problem within the scope of known science, there is no need to look further or to invent an esoteric explanation. That is the situation here as straightforward deductions indicate that all the effects noted in Table 1 carry strong implications regarding electromagnetic radiation and magnetic fields. 2 And an advanced 4 mathematical theory points directly to high-frequency, electromagnetic radiation and magnetic fields as the basis for the anti-gravitational and anti- inertia] behavior of UFOs. 3 Study of all the categories of UFO effects should lead to a detailed knowledge of the fields surrounding UFOs. It would certainly be desirable to know the total energy coming from UFOs, the band of wavelengths involved, the pulse rate and pulse width of the electromagnetic radiation. Also, regarding magnetic fields, peak field intensities, pulse rates, and wave forms should be determined. When a complete understanding of the emanations from UFOs has been achieved, it should be only a matter of engineering development to reproduce the advanced technology that has been on display for several decades. It would be invaluable for atmospheric flight and space exploration. Upon recognizing that the interferences being discussed are physical, one comes to see that UFOs must also be physical. They must be real objects in the sky, chasing jets, hovering at low altitude, landing, coming up out of the oceans, or whatever maneuver is observed: Such realization raises some profound questions. Who designed them? Where were they manufactured? Who are the pilots? And what are their intentions? REFERENCES 1.

Because of the variations of shape reported, there may have been four or five. About 7:45 PM, two teenagers were tossing a ball back and forth in the backyard of a house near Flushing. The male teen noticed a triangle of lights hovering over them. The lights were so bright he could not look at them. It suddenly moved away at a high rate of speed with a loud rumble to the southwest. Just before 8 PM, another teenager, Greg Brown, was jogging east on Beecher Road when he became aware of a light shining down on him. Looking up, he saw a very bright white light 100 to 150 feet above him, so bright it hurt his eyes to look at it. He stopped jogging and the light just hovered over him. He said he was not afraid, so he continued jogging. The light followed him for about three minutes and then it took off toward the east at a high rate of speed. Three German shepherds that never bark at Greg when he is jogging were barking like crazy. Greg never heard any sound from the object. At about the same time, around 8 PM, Ed Saucier left Gena Thompson's house at 3259 Dillon Road and started to drive north on Dillon when he saw Andrus, continued never lose sight of our ultimate goal — solving the UFO phenomenon and all of the beneficial scientific ramifications associated with this enigma. It still remains as \"the greatest mystery of our age.\" The scientific knowledge exists today to solve this enigma, provided we are willing to concentrate our efforts in a cooperative, positive direction and to stop this internal bickenYig. Are you ready to accept this challenge? two large white lights and two small red lights off to the east. He continued to drive but kept watching the lights. As he watched, another light came from the south and joined the other lights, which were now in a V or triangle. The triangle of lights took off really fast, moving toward his car. It flew over his car and then paced it. The lights were shining all over the car and the road. Looking up through the windshield, he could see a cigar- shaped craft about 100 feet above him. He estimated it was a big as a house, or 30 feet long. There were protrusions which stuck out about three feet on either side of the mid- section. He turned east on Pierson Road and the object stayed with him for about a quarter of a mile. It then flew over his car and moved west. Saucier had his radio on and didn't hear any sound from the object. Saucier arrived home about 8:05 and called Gena. When he told her what he had seen, she thought he was 'joking. She went to bed after talking with him, but then she became aware of a very loud rumbling sound. She jumped out of bed and ran to a window. She saw a craft with triangular- shaped lighting on it hovering about 100 to 200 feet above the ground, lighting up the whole area. The family's cats were in the yard under the lights and they were in a panic. The younger cat scurried under a fence and the older one bolted for the wood pile. Two more craft passed over the house, turned south and then east. Gena called the Flushing City Police Department. The officer she spoke with said he didn't know if any military exercise was going on at the time (he did not make a record of the call). As Gena returned to the window, two craft flew over the house and were joined by another one that had been flying south. The three craft then traveled south of the house and turned back east. She continued to watch and in about five minutes another craft flew over the house. About this time, her mother arrived home and Gena asked her to come to the window and look. Mrs. Thompson could see the lights but (confirmed on next page)"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Coyne, continued could not see any shape. Gena's 14-year-old brother was home at the time and was watching with Gena. However, the boy has refused to talk about the sighting to Gena'or anyone else. All he will say is that it was not an airplane and did not make airplane sounds. We have checked on the witnesses and have found that all of them are trustworthy, intellgent and stable, and none of them has ever used drugs. We also checked with the police and found no report had been filed on Gena's call. Gena lives in the township, outside the city jurisdiction, so this may be the reason it wasn't logged. The field where Ed Saucier had his sighting was checked very carefully. There were some small broken pines but this could have been caused by deer in the area. A total of 12 people are known to have seen the lights, but only three would give a report. Four people living on the east side of Dillon next 'to the field would not talk about it. Mrs. Thompson did not see it up close, so she would not commit herself. Five adults and the teenager make up the report. On February 23, I contacted two witnesses of a sighting on Morrish Road in Flushing. One was Debbie TJeneen, who was waiting outdoors for a friend to arrive when, at around 8:15 PM, she heard a very loud roar. Looking up, she saw three very bright white lights. One light was in front and two were in the back, forming a triangular pattern. Debbie called to her father, who went outside and joined her. They both agreed there were three' objects because they could see the stars between them as they moved east to west across the sky. All the dogs in the neighborhood were in a frenzy. Debbie and her father agreed that the objects were not planes nor did they sound like planes. They said they did not want to be involved in this and the o,nly reason they talked to me is because I know them. UFO HOTLINE REPORTS By BOB GRIBBLE The following is a flash report of incidents received by the National UFO Reporting Center, Seattle, Washington. Names of all witnesses are on file at the Center. February 9, 1984, 9:15 PM, Barre, Vermont: Three observers watched a white glow move across a clear sky at a fairly slow speed. Suddenly the glow made a 90-degree turn, changed color from white to blue, instantly increased speed and moved out of sight. They watched the glow for about two minutes. February 19, 1984, 3:30 AM, Everett, Washington: While driving near the Boeing 747 airliner plant, the witness observed a silvery-green, egg- shaped object moving toward his car from a wooded area. Described as being a little bit bigger than a softball 6 and a little bit smaller than a soccer ball, the object bounced from one side of the roadway to the other in front of the car. The object passed over the front fender of the car and then moved out of sight after being observed for four to six seconds. February 23, 1984, 10 PM, Whitmore Lake, Michigan: A huge circular object with white lights covering the underside passed directly over a car at a very low altitude. The only occupant of the car described the object as being wider than the roadway and giving off a humming sound. After about seven minutes, it moved out of sight. March 11, 1984,12:04 AM, Wolcott, Connecticut: A mother and daughter — looking out the family room window — observed a big cylinderical-shaped object about seven feet from the ground and four feet from the window. The object remained in the same spot for about seven minutes then moved away. No sound was heard. March 25, 1984, 8:55 PM, Santa Monica, California: A motorist reported that a bright ball of red light — about ten inches in diameter — maneuvered around her car with a bouncing motion. The ball, moving at about head level, approached to within one foot of the car and illuminated the hood and windows. No sound was heard and the duration of the incident was about one minute. March 29, 1984, 8 PM, West Nottingham, New Hampshire: What appeared to be a triangular-shaped object passed over a car at an altitude of about 50 feet. The object had two bright lights like car headlights and gave off no sound."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"DIAMOND-SHAPED UFO IN PENNSYLVANIA By STAN GORDON The sighting of a huge diamond- shaped Unidentified Flying Object is one of a number of sightings being investigated by the Pennsylvania Association For the Study of the Unexplained (PASU). On the night of February 29,1984, Mary Nagel (a pseudonym) went outside to feed her dog. Mary lives in a rural area near the town of Mechanicsburg. The sky was partly cloudy and it was windy on the night of the observation. Mary happened to look up and observed the object approaching at a very low altitude. The dog also noticed the object and stared at it as it passed through the sky. The object was described as diamond shaped. The main body structure appeared to be black (dark) and solid. There were large white lights one at the top point and one at the bottom point, as well as one bright red light at each end point, and four smaller white lights between each of the four point intersections. The two red lights blinked whereas the white lights all remained stationary. The object was described as being the length of a tractor trailer and as wide as two tractor trailers. The object, reported to have been no more than approximately 50 feet off the ground, ascended to tree top level as it passed over a group of pine trees and continued southeast until it was gone from sight. The object moved continuously but wobbled as it passed over. The object was observed for approximately one minute. It was later learned that the TV reception was reported to be fuzzy in Mary's home at the time that the object passed over. A number of other UFO sightings have been reported throughout Pennsylvania during the first three months of 1984. Most of these turned out to be misidentifications of meteors, aircraft lights, and prominent planets RED and stars, but several other cases are more significant and are being studied by PASU investigators. Among the cases under investi- gation are the following: January 31 — A fellow was taking an early evening walk in a rural area near the town of Pottsville when he noticed a bright yellow-white light approaching from the south. At first he thought it was a helicopter but he heard no sound. The light began to move toward him and it hovered motionless directly overhead at approximately tree top level. The light continued to hover for about five minutes and then moved toward the west at a high rate of speed. February 3 — Near Latrobe, a young couple parked on an isolated rural road noticed a bright white light approaching the rear of the car. The light was larger than the diameter of a flashlight, and it approached the car at a speed faster than if someone was running toward them with a light. As the light came very close to the car, it made a 90-degree abrupt turn to the left and was lost to view. No sound was heard as the mystery light approached the vehicle. Interestingly, a Bigfoot sighting was reported the same night not far from this area by another young couple also parking in a desolate wooded area. The week after the UFO experi- ence, and at the same location, the same couple reported another odd occurrence. The female companion complained of a sudden cold chill, and as the driver reached to turn the heater on, they both saw a bright fire suddenly blaze about 15 feet from the passenger door. The flames did not expand in coverage area, but rose higher to several feet. This scared them both bad enough that they said they would never return to that area. Other UFO and Fortean reports are being received from the same general area. February 9 — Uniontown residents reported observing two bright lights moving from west to east in a zig- zag pattern. The lights appeared to hover over high tension lines for several minutes before they continued across the sky. One witness reported that his dogs appeared to be very nervous and would not bark while the lights were being observed. February 9 — In Lloydsville, an Air Force veteran who had been a UFO skeptic reported that at approximately 10:15 PM as he was walking outside, he noticed a dark object that appeared to be round and surrounded by numerous colored lights moving low in his direction. At first, he thought it might be an (continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"RECENT SIGHTINGS IN NORTH CAROLINA The following summary of sightings in the Carolines is from the September-December 1983 issue of the Tarheel UFO Study Croup Newsletter. October 26,1983, Hickory, NC, 9 PM — David Keener reported to Diana Morris of the Catawba County Sheriff's Dept. Communication Center that he had seen a diamond-shaped UFO come by his car above Highway 321, northeast of Hickory. It made no sound, but was bright green in the back' and red in the front. It hovered and then moved to a higher elevation, he watched the object for about five minutes. November 15,1983, Vale, NC, 4 PM — Mr. and Mrs. Mel Huffman were awakened by the barking of neighborhood dogs. They watched a big white oblong UFO outside their home'that gave off \"points of light.\" Sandra, who is a dental assistant, said her husband, who first saw the object, had seen a little red light on it. November 29,1983, Grantham, NC, 9 PM — A .woman was watching television when she heard a low, rumbling sound. She thought at first it was a jet from Seymour Johnson'AFB, but the noise became lower and louder. She went into her back yard and saw a green ball of light with the apparent size of a basketball moving in a low arc towards the north. She watched the bright green light for approximately 30 seconds as the noise continued. As the light went out, the noise stopped . suddenly. The Public Affairs Office at Seymour Johnson AFB said base officials did not know what the UFO was and no operation was occurring that would have caused the light and noise. November 28, 1983, Winston- Salem, NC, 8:40 PM — A Winston- Salem woman noticed a ball of light approaching and went into the house to get her friend J.L. and her two children (ages 8 and 11). The object approached to within 400 feet and .appeared to be half the size of their house. As .it approached from the north and hovered at treetop level, three smaller objects appeared to come from behind the object and travel southeast toward the .Union Globe Battery plant;(about one mile away). The three smaller objects seemed to land in a swampy area near the plant. As the woman and children ran through a field toward the large object, J.L. jumped into his car and pursued the object .through the field at a high rate of speed. The object, was now travelling north in the direction from which it came. J. L. reached a road where he turned to gain access to Hwy. 158 which could take him in the direction of the object. He managed to follow the object by turning off Hwy. 158 (at one point during the chase he pulled out in front of a truck). As he turned a curve he could see the object hovering near a small lake. This was his closest approach to the object, which was not 100 to 200 feet away. Within seconds the object vanished as if turning out a light. All of the witnesses described the object as a large yellowish ball of light having the intensity of a table lamp but with a \"different\" kind of light. J. L. said he felt as though he could \"stick his hand through Jt.\" All four witnesses complained of eye irritation. J.L. stated that his face and hands turned red and felt sore. Later that evening, J.L. was outside when he heard a sound that seemed to come from the whole field in back of .the house. -He could only describe the sound as similar to that of Chewbacca in the Star Wars movies. After hearing the cry twice, he ran to get the woman in the house. After listening several minutes, the sound was heard again. The woman panicked and they both ran back to the house and locked the doors. (Case still under investigation) Gordon, continued aircraft taking off from the Latrobe Airport, or possibly waiting for clearance to land, but it did not turn toward the airport, nor did it shut off its lights as aircraft normally do when they leave the airport area. The object, which appeared to be about 30 feet in diameter, was approaching at an altitude of about 5,000 feet. He ran next door to get another neighbor to be a witness and they both watched as the object passed over but made no sound of any kind. The neighbor looked at the object and said \"this is scary\" and went back into her home. The witness was quoted as saying, \"I'm an Air Force vet and I know planes. 8 This was definitely not a plane, helicopter or any other flying machine known and used by man on this Earth that I have ever heard of or seen. There are UFOs in our skies . I doubted UFO's, but now I am a firm believer. We are being observe'd by someone from afar.\" February 21 — A young couple were sitting in a parking lot waiting for one of their parents to arrive. They were a short distance from the Big Boulder Ski area, in the Pocono Mountains. In the distance they noticed a bright red flashing light, which they thought was the forestry service fire tower: It than began to move slowly and it quit flashing as it approached in .the direction of the car. As it came closer, the light took on a circular form, yet it was not sharply defined and it appeared fuzzy to look at. The object came to rest about 100 feet above the car. There also appeared to be several red and green lights flashing around the perimeter of the object. The driver turned the car engine off, but the object appeared to be silent. A car began to approach, and the object then rose straight up into the sky, first at a slow pace then more rapidly. It moved toward the left and rear of the car and then moved swiftly out of sight. The total length of sighting was between 10 and 15 minutes. For several days after the incident, the car radio appeared to be very staticky, unlike the clear reception that is normally produced."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"An Alternative to the Microwave Theory of the Hot Ring Syndrome In a recent issue of the MUFON Journal (November 1983), Jim McCampbell advanced a theory to explain the heating of finger rings and watch bands in CEII cases. The crux of his theory is that microwaves emitted by a UFO have a wavelength comparable to standard ring diameters. In such cases, the rings are \"tuned\" to the microwave frequency and efficiently draw energy from the field. This energy is converted to heat and causes a rise in ring temperature sufficient to cause discomfort or even first-degree burns. Jim estimates the microwave flux to be about 17 milliwatts/cm 2 , based on the percipients' sensations of heat. The author has always been skeptical of the existence of microwaves in the radiation field about a UFO. He has instead championed the existence of powerful, low frequency magnetic fields as the most likely cause of automotive ignition failure, anomolous compass behavior, and other disturbances in CEII cases. In examining the anecdotal data presented in Jim's article, the author has concluded that the evidence is against microwave resonant heating, and for Elf (Extremely Low Frequency) magnetic fields. First we will examine the heating effect due to microwaves on a copper ring in the plane of the oncoming waves' electric field. A copper ring of 1.7 cm diameter (apparently a number 6 l / 2 ladies ring, as chosen by Jim in this article) and 2 millimeters in thickness will be used as representative of rings worn by CEII percipients. NOTE: This paper uses \"exponential\" notation in expressing large or small numbers. Thus the number 30,500 is written 3.05 E4, where E4 tells how many places the decimal point should be shifted to the right from the position in 3.05. Similarly, a small number like .0012 is written as 1.2 E-3, where the negative exponent E-3 tells how many places the decimal point should be shifted to the left of the position in the number 1.2. By JOE KIRK THOMAS Copyright ® 1984 by Joe Kirk Thomas Ring V=BA Figure One An order of magnitude calculation of the voltage induced in the ring by a hi frequency electromagnetic field can be made using the \"small loop\" approximation. A \"small loop\" is a loop of wire whose diameter is much smaller than the wavelength of the oncoming wave. Such a loop, in this case the ring itself, is shown in Figure One. At low frequencies, the magnetic field B, and hence the time rate of change of the magnetic field, B, is uniform over the area, A R , of the loop. A voltage, V, is induced in the ring by the changing magnetic flux, and is simply the product of area A R and B. For an oscillating magnetic field of B sin 2nft, where B is the peak amplitude and f the frequency, it can be shown that the average voltage induced in the ring is: 27TfB A,, O R vr When the frequency is so high that the wavelength is twice the ring's diameter—the resonant condition—the \"small loop\" approximation is still approximately correct. But beyond this, as the wavelength becomes smaller, the magnetic field is only non uniform, but in general may reverse itself many times in transversing the ring diameter. As a result, the field tends to cancel itself out, and little voltage is induced. In order to assess the effect of the voltage on the ring, one has to use an \"equivalent circuit.\" Figure Two is the Ring Equivalent Circuit are Two equivalent circuit for the ring, and is composed of a voltage source, a resistance, and an inductance. 2 The simplest form of an inductor is a coil. It doesn't dissipate heat as a resistance does, but nevertheless impedes the flow of current by producing a magnetic field which \"reacts\" against a change of current. The total impedance is therefore due to the \"reactance\" of the coil, which is 2jrfL, L being the inductance of the ring, and the resistance R. The inductance of the ring is given by an equation too complex to reproduce here, but some attention must be given the resistance of the ring. Figure Three (a) shows that an electric current flows uniformly through the cross section ^Sof a wire at low frequencies. But at high frequencies, as shown in Figure Three (b), the current tends to flow on the outside of the wire. The depth at which the current flows is called the \"skin depth,\" and is given by 3 (2) (iirf where Pis the electrical resistivity of the conductor, and p. is its permeability. Since copper is not • particularly magnetic, its permeability is not appreciably different from that of air. Since the ring resistance 4 is directly proportional to the resistivity of the (continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"Thomas, continued material and the circumference of the ring, and inversely proportional to the cross sectional area actually carrying the current, the reader can see that for Figure Three (b), the resistance is R = p p • 2ir r (3) ring 2 TTr , -6 wire where 2fr r ^ is the ring'scircumference and 2 n r w j re • <J is the shaded current- carrying area. Now the resistivity, P, of copper is 17.54 E-9 ohm meters, and the microwave frequency for which the diameter is one half wavelength is 8.8 E9 hertz. From equation (2) we calculate, the skin depth to be 7.105 E-7 meters. Thus, for a ring of radius .85 cm and cross section of radius .1 cm, the resistance is .21 ohms. The inductance, however, can be calculated to be 26.4 E-9 henries. Since the resulting reactance is 2ir(8.8E 9) (26.4 E-9), or 1460 ohms, the primary impedance is obviously due to the inductor. Therefore, the current is approximately given by Ohm's Law 5 as: I = V 2irfL (4). The peak magnetic field B Q can be determined from the flux level of 20 mw/cm 2 to be 9.153 E-7 Tesla. The voltage V can now be calculated from equation (1) to be 8.123 volts. Equation (4) then yields a current of only 5.6 milliamps. From this we can show from the well known power relationship 6 I 2 R (5) that the heat dissipated in the ring is only 6.51 E-6, or 6.51 millionths of a watt! If the heating time were taken to be 5 minutes, the toal energy dissipated as heat would be only (6.51 E-6) (300) = 1.95 E-3 joules, which is equivalent to only .00047 calories. The rise in temperature of the ring is giveri by: 7 AT = AQ_ (6) Low Frequency (a) High Frequency (b) Distribution of current in similar wires at different frequencies. Figure Three where AQ is .00047 calories, rn • is the mass of the ring, in this case, 1.5 grams, and C is the specific heat capacity of copper, which is .092 calorie -'°K •'. This turns out to be .0034° K, or .006°F! Realizing the approximate nature of the above calculations, the author conducted an experiment in the laboratory in which a copper ring of 1.7 cm diameter and 12 gage wire was irradiated for 5 minutes with microwaves at 8.8 Gigahertz and a flux level of 20 mw/cm 2 . Figure 4 shows the ring- suspended in front of the microwave horn. No perceptible rise in ;temperature of the ring was observed. The same equations which gave an approximate value of microwave heating of the ring can give a more accurate value of heating due to ELF magnetic fields. If we choose a magnetic field, of perhaps .05 Tesla and a frequency of 100 hz, values deduced from other CEII effects, then equation (1) says the voltage induced in the ring 1 will be about 5 millivolts. Because the frequency is low, the current will flow uniformly through the conductor cross section, as shown in Figure 3(a). The reader can see that the equation for the resistance of the ring is now simply: P -I wire P : 2TT r ring (7) wire Figure 4 Plugging the appropriate values into this equation gives a resistance of .298 milliohms. The ring's reactance is now 2Tr(10p)(26.4 E-9), or .016 milliohms. The bulk of the impedance at this point, then, is due to the resistance, and from Ohm's law: I= ^ (8) R or (5 E-3)/.298E-3=16.91 amps! From equation (5), the power dissipated as heat is easily calcualted to be 8.5 E-2 watts. If the ring is again heated for. 5 minutes, the total heat would be 25.6 joule, or 6.142 calories. The (continued on next page) 10"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"Thomas, continued temperature rise as calculated from equation (6) would be 80°F. If the original ring temperature was, say, 90° (due to the wearer's body heat), the final temperature could be as much as 170°F! Please note that equation (6) does not include heat lost to air or to the finger. The result is, however, approximately correct. Note also that if the postulated magnetic field was twice as high, or .1 Tesla, four times the heat could be dissipated. The ring would then reach approximately 170°F in only 1 minute and 15 seconds! To verify the above results, the author subjected the test ring to a magnetic field of .005 Tesla at 1000 hertz. The field coil is shown in Figure 5, resting on top of the oscillator and power amplifier. As can be seen from equation (1), the voltage induced in the loop is proportional to the product of frequency f and field B . Thus, 1000hz at .005 Tesla has the same effect as 100 hz at .050 Tesla. After 5 minutes the ring was quite hot to the touch. No calorimetry equipment was present to measure the final temperature of the ring,'but the result was consistent with the foregoing analysis. The author has shown both theoretically and experimentally that powerful extremely low frequency magnetic fields are the most likely explanation for the hot ring syndrome. For microwaves to produce Figure 5 comparable heating, the flux level would have to be many orders of magnitude greater than that hypothesized, 8 and the effect of such powerful microradiation on biological systems would be catastrophic. The author is heavily indebted to Mr. Terry Kersey for his assistance in performing the laboratory experi ments. REFERENCES 1.

The promise is that technical details concerning the field surrounding UFOs could be determined with some precision. The subject reported by Joe Kirk Thomas is a rare and outstanding achievement in that direction. He has shown by theory and experiment, at least to my satisfaction, that pulsed magnetic fields could account for the heating of finger rings near UFOs. He has also developed a very convincing argument that the observed * effects can not be attributed to microwaves as I did. However, a few minor problems in my mind are yet to be resolved. They will be taken up privately with Thomas in a joint search for the fullest understanding of the experiential data. Attention should be called to some relevant facts: a) Pulsed magnetic fields have been well recongized in association with UFOs, such as, rattling of metallic signs, magnetized watches, and spinning compasses. I initiated a group effort in the latter category behind the scenes in Pasadena that was based upon my own \"poor-boy\" experiments. Thomas has a key role in that effort to bring the experiments up to the level of scientific respectability and he is making notable progress, b) I have submitted to MUFON for publication a new article, having been duly reviewed by our Consultants, that attributes the \"metallic taste\" effect to slowly- pulsed, magnetic fields.

They parked off the road by a creek at the foot of the canyon and fished all afternoon, then built a campfire and had their supper. They sat up watching the fire die down until about midnight, then went to bed in their sleeping bags in the van. George went right to sleep, but Carl was testless. He decided to go out and make himself a cup of coffee over the coals. When he sat up, he could see the new compass they had left on the hump over the engine housing. In the moonlight he could see that the arrow was moving slowly. As he watched it, it would go about three quarters of the way around, from SE through N then down to SW, and back. He picked it up, wondering if it was being affected by the engine coil, clicked it off and on again. In his hand it still moved around and back. So he put it down and went outside. He could hear the water running in the swift shallow creek and hear a waterfall a little way upstream. Other than that, the night was still. Across the creek on the bare hillside five or six lights were wandering around at about walking speed. His first thought was that sheepherders must be looking for lost sheep, but that hardly seemed likely at one o'clock in the morning. And the lights did not look like flashlights. They were white, about the size of basketballs, and they just floated along. They had no beam coming from them. Curious, Carl walked down to the stream and shouted across the water, \"Hey, out there!\" Immediately all the lights went out. Carl started back to the van to tell George, but before he got McCampbell, continued will be accepted. c) Pulsed magnetic fields are an essential component of the anti- gravitation theory developed by Dr. Fred Alzofon (13th Annual MUFON Symposium) with whom I have been working quite closely for several years. d) Such fields are also fundamental to some physical effects of UFOs that apparently involve such esoteric and complex matters as electron . spin resonance, nuclear magnetic resonance, and meastable states of atmospheric gases. My research suggests that the electromagnetic environment around UFOs is a combination of: a) electromagnetic radiation of many wavelengths including microwaves that are pulsed at a rather rapid rate, and b) magnetic fields that are pulsed at a 12 . rather slow rate. Considerably more detail on these components has been worked out. Thomas has probably developed the correct interpretationof hot rings. But one should be cautious about applying the idea of pulsed, magnetic fields as a total explanation of UFO effects. Magnetic fields alone would be hard pressed to produce facial blisters, loss of hair, paralysis, and a host of other effects that appear to be associated with radiation. We are not dealing with a simple EITHER-OR type of problem but one that seems to be an extemely complex matter of BOTH- AND. If Thomas is entirely correct, I am satisfied to have stimulated his effort. I congratulate him for the most expert, technical analysis of UFO data that I have seen in 10 years as Director of Research for MUFON. James McCampbell Belmont, Calif. BACK BBOWM there he was aware that it was getting brighter around him. Looking over his shoulder, he could see coming toward him, flying above the trees on the other side of the road, a very large bright light, larger than the van. It stopped about 75 feet away, pulsating slowly as it changed from dark green to light green. The light in a circle beneath it was so bright that Carl could see each pine needle on the ground. \"I could have read the newspaper,\" he says. After three or four minutes, the light continued on its path from southwest to northeast, following the canyon. By this time George had got up and he watched with Carl as it moved along, illuminating the canyon wall. About three miles away they could see it rise to the top of Black Mountain, where there was a fire lookout tower. It spiraled the top of the mountain, its lights clearly reflected in the windows of the tower. Then, picking up speed, it shot into the sky and was lost to sight among the stars. The next morning the boys broke camp and started the steep drive out of the canyon. They reached a point where the road dropped sharply on the west side, giving an unobstructed view across the valley. Just below them they could see an apparently abandoned log house standing in a field. There was an outhouse and some rusting pieces of equipment, but the puzzling thing was a large black circle in the green grass.

As they thought, when they found the old ranch house it was empty, and there was no sign that anyone had been there for a long time. But about 150 feet from the house, an eight foot wide ring was burned to the ground in the two- foot tall grass, leaving an unburned circle about 30 feet across in the middle. On the edges of the ring, the grass leaned away from the burned area. This grass was very dehydrated and crumpled when the fellows kicked it. After Carl and George got home, they told their family and close friends about their experience but they did not report it to any authorities. (Carl did tell his science teacher, who had no explanation.) UFOs had been reported in the area that summer, Carl says, but he and his brother had taken no particular interest in the stories. They didn't talk much about what they had seen because \"at that time, if you did tell many people they thought you were a little weird.\" *** ' . ' ' Carl's second sighting, which he considers the most interesting of the two, occurred 15 years later, in August 1978. By that time George had moved from Canada to Chicago, and Carl was working in Quesnal, about 300 miles north of Kelowna, where his sister still lived. Having a few days off, Carl started home for a visit. The road south, Highway 97, had been recently refinished. It was wide, straight and smooth, and the road crews had cleared the trees back from about 200 feet on each side. About 20 miles from the town of William's Lake, something flashed across the road in front of him, from left to right. It looked to him as if someone had thrown a beer bottle, the Canadian kind with a long neck, through the air in front of his car. No one was in sight. In a few minutes he saw something moving on the right side of the car, glimpsing it through the upper part of the window, on the passenger side. Rolling down the window, he leaned over and looked out. A large brown metallic object was flying along at about tree top level parallel to the road. Carl had a moment of panic and felt it was going to \"get him.\" He floored the gas pedal and shot down the road at 80 or 90 miles an hour for five or ten minutes until he was sure he had left the thing behind. Then he pulled over to the side of the road for a rest stop. He walked a few steps off the shoulder of the road and was standing facing the east when the brown object came flying over the road behind him, flew past him and circled back to stop 75 to 100.feet away and about 30 feet above the,ground. He could see now that it was three or four times as long in diameter as the length of his 1975 Dodge station wagon, and about 40 feet high. It was shaped like a high crowned hat with a small turned'down brim. It was a dull dark brown with a smooth surface, no seams,: bolts, rivets. No windows, no light, no noise. \"It was totally silent,\" he said. \"You wouldn't believe how quiet this thing was.\" Carl didn't think to look at his watch, but it seemed as if the craft. hovered in front of him for about- ten minutes. While he looked at it, he had the feeling something was looking back at him. • Although he had been frightened when he first saw it and was frightened again when he saw it coming back (\"I wished I hadn't stopped\"), now that he was confronted by it he felt very calm. He noticed that it was swinging just slightly back and forth as it hovered, and he could see a little fuzziness at the \"brim,\" as though he were seeing that edge through a haze. Finally, it began to lift and fly away from him to the southeast across the rolling countryside. He had stopped on a slight rise, and from that vantage point he could watch it go, bobbing up and down'as it followed the contours of the . ground below. When it was out of sight he got back in his car and drove on to Kelowna, arriving about midnight. We asked him if there might have been a time lapse. \"No,\" he said, \"but there was a time thing there. Seemed odd when I got home. I think alj this happened in the time frame I'm saying. That's exact- ly as I remember it. But when I got home it seemed like I'd got there in no time at all, and it's a long way to drive. But then I write that off to the fact that I drove pretty fast!\" ' Carl, now 40, has since moved from British Columbia to Salt Lake City, where he works as a railroad dispatcher. He had never reported his UFO experiences to anyone before nor talked about them much, but he has always wondered about them. He would like to learn more about the UFO phenomenon and someday understand what it was that he saw. 13"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"A GUIDE TO SOME NATURAL GROUND MARKINGS By KEITH BASTERFIELD MUFON Continental Coordinator For Australia/New Zealand Over the years there have been a substantial number of physical ground markings, some of which have been associated with the UFO phenomena. However, investigation reveals a proportion of these are clearly explainable in more mundane terms. Every investigator should be aware of at least some of the natural phenomena which can, at times, appear unnatural in origin. Once these possibilities are eliminated, in any one case, then an investigator can be more confident that he or she may be dealing with a new unknown phenomenon. The natural causes for the ground markings I speak of are fungi, leaf smut and slime mould. FUNGI If you come across a circular doughnut-shaped ring, that is, a ring of grass growth different to the central portion and the surrounding grass, in a paddock/field/lawn/sporting oval or grasslands, then suspect a fungus. Fungi are a large group of plants having two important characteristics: (a) They are non-green plants devoid of chlorophyll, and (b) the plant body is composed of a thread-like, branching, structure termed hyphae. These may occur in an inter- locking tangle, collectively known as mycelium. Fungi thrive in any environment providing good growth conditions, for example, soil, the living and dead remains of plants and animals and other organic materials such as foods and leather. The perennial mycelium of the fungus grows and spreads outwards in a radial pattern, thus creating a circularly affected area. Mycelium, like matted cobwebs, live below the soil surface at a depth of a few to, perhaps, 30cm. The rings we see on the surface are formed by the outward growth of the mycelium from the central point, 14 followed by death of the older region. Mycelium breaks down the organic matter in the soil and liberates ammonia, which encourages growth of grass immediately outside the ring. The mycelium prevents water entering the soil and so a bare ring is formed. Bacteria in the soil converts the ammonia to nitrates, so the older mycelium dies. These nitrates then become available to plants and growth, inside the ring, starts again. Fungus rings, which are often referred to as \"fairy rings,\" increase in diameter from year to year, if conditions are right. Diameter then, depends on age and rate of growth. Studies of rings in Colorado, USA, cite a species of Agaricus which was 54 meters across and an estimated 250 years old. Mushrooms and toadstools are the fruiting bodies of the fungi and appear at the outer edge of the ring when conditions are suitable. You may recall that the Flying Saucer Review reported the finding of huge mushrooms in South America which have entered UFO literature in connection with the UFO phenomena. A more likely cause is association with a fungus ring. In summary, then, fungus rings may have the following characteristics: 1. A more or less continuous band of bare ground or stunted growth. Size varying from 2 to 250 meters. 2. Appear singly or in groups. 3. If checked over several years, they will be observed growing outwards on an average of 30 cm per year. 4. They can grow around rocks, anthills or trees. 5. White mycelium will be present in the ring soild but not in the surrounding soil. 6. The ammonia and nitrate contents of the soil, in the bare region, will be higher than outside the ring. 7. The bare ground could be resistant to water. 8. Mushrooms, toadstools or puff balls may be found at the outer edge. SLIME MOULD Mysterious circles, or arcs of strange black, \"greasy\" specks can appear on lawns overnight. People usually reach for the phone and call the nearest UFO group. This growth is most likely to occur following a night of rain. Close inspection reveals that these particles cover the blades of grass, clover, etc., but there is no indentation, flattening of grass, or dead rings. The particles may be removed by mowing but, if left to themselves, they will gradually decay within a few days, often losing color and becoming gray. Slime moulds are a unique group of organisms whose origin and relationships have not yet been agreed upon. In schemes of plant classification, they are associated with fungi. Besides lawns, they occur in most woods, sawdust and rotting logs. LEAF SMUTS Our final group of ground markings also occur on lawns as black and dusty masses of spores. They are leaf smuts, a class of fungi known as Basidiomycetes which lack a conspicuous fruiting body. Smuts are parasites. BARREN RINGS Before concluding our analysis of natural ground markings we must discuss \"barren rings\" which have been observed in Canada growing 50 to 60 cm per year but with no trace of fungi in the soil. Bacteria are possibly responsible, but this has not been conclusively proven. If in doubt as to the identification of a physical trace, take pictures and soil samples to your local department of agriculture or botanic gardens and ask them to assist you.

Since I first published my second- by-seond time-line analysis of the event in 1976 1 (which established a duration of 300 (+30) seconds of continuous observation of the object) Klass has been greatly distressed — determined one way or another to reduce that five- minute figure because he realized that his precious meteor \"theory\" demanded a much, much, shorter-lived event. Page after page of irrelevancies, diversions, iHogical jabberings and \"infantile jejeune hysterical verbosity\" 2 has issued from his pen, yet never in these eight years has he thought to challenge my research with a time-line analysis of his own. Indeed, he even neglected to include a time analysis in his earlier published pontifications on the subject 3 . I wonder why. Could it be because Klass never actually investigated the case to any depth? Could it be because he has never even met Col. Coyne, two of the other three crewmen, or any of the corroborating ground witnesses? Could it be because he knows full well that the meteor theory is untenable but is for some reason unequipped to admit his error? Now suddenly it appears 4 that he concedes the five-minute duration but thinks (incorrectly) that he can salvage the situation by proving the meteors may last that long or even longer. How very strange, because five years ago Klass stated: \"/ fully agree that if the UFO was continually in the crew's sight for even half that time or 2 l / 2 minutes it could not have been a fireball.\" 5 Dear me. What tack will he pursue next? Certainly never a retraction, and I implore Mr. Hall to show some compassion and not distress Mr. Klass further by,forcing the issue. We must remember that we are dealing with an individual who in his utter frustration over the matter wrote to me 6 suggesting that Coyne and I take a helicopter up to 1,500 feet over the northeast Ohio hills and forests and put it into a 4,000 f.p.m. dive! Gosh, I don't think either.Coyne or I have any reason to do ourselves in. We haven't lost face over anything. 1. FSR, u. 22, No. 4. 2. A quote from Charles Bowen, 9/18/77. 3. UFOs Explained, 1974. 4.

If the police think a sighting is serious enough, they are instructed to report it to GEPAN, or the Group for the Study of Unidentified Aerospace Phenomena. GEPAN is a part of CNES, or the National Center for Space Studies, the French equivalent of NASA. In the Nicolai landing case of 1981 (see No. 193, March 1984) the police took photographs and soil samples for laboratory testing and then passed their report on to GEPAN when they realized something unusual had happened. GEPAN sent in its investigators later to establish weather conditions and general environmental data on the day of the sighting. The next step was to make lengthy inquiries to military services, civil aviation authorities and private aircraft clubs to ascertain activity in the region on the day of the sighting. If the report still holds up, then soil and vegetation testing is .begun, a process that can take two to three years, as was the case in the Nicolai landing. GEPAN has now published the following ten-point guide for the French public on steps to take if a citizen thinks he or she has seen a UFO: 1. Attract the attention of other witnesses and don't forget to note their names and addresses. 2. Note the precise time of the observation. 3. Note the locale and geographical details. 4. Note the distances between you and the UFO, its measurements, shape and color. 5. Note the noise levels, wind direction and smells. 6. Note your own conditions and feelings on seeing the UFO. 7. Note whether the UFO is affecting the surrounding vegetation in any way. 8. Take photographs. 9. Note the UFO's position in relation to the horizon. 10.

On July 15, in conjunction with .the Fund for UFO Research, co-authors Barry Greenwood and Larry Fawcett will be at the bookstore at the Pentagon in Washington, D.C., to autograph books during a press conference. Also, Prentice-Hall has arranged for a national publicity tour for the authors in early July. To date, this tentatively includes appearances on the \"Merv Griffin Show\" and \"Good Morning America.\" A spokesperson for Prentice-Hall, Inc. has stated that the inquiries they have received already regarding the book have been unprecedented. Interest in this book is extremely high, and advance copies have already been requested by the Air Force as well as a New York television station, in addition to numerous individuals. Your Director has a copy of the Forward by Dr. J. Allen Hynek and the, Preface by the co-authors. However, we haven't received the proof copy from the publishers, as promised, at the time of this writing. We published a book review by Robert Bletchman in the March 1984 issue of the MUFON UFO Journal. *** The National Committee on Public Information and Education has updated the MUFON TELUFONET, which will be distributed to all State Directors. The purpose of this UFO Telephone Network is to enable MUFON Headquarters in Seguin, Texas, to contact all State Directors within an hour's time in the event of an important media event or news development. Walt Andrus will activate the system by making.two phone calls to State Directors within the Continental U.S., who will each, in turn, make a phone call to another State Director in a nearby state. Because the system is actually a chain system, it is vitally important that once you receive a phone call, you immediately make the call you are assigned to make: Persons failing to do so will prevent everyone listed later on the list from receiving the message. If for any reason the State Director is unable to reach the assigned name, they should skip to the next name on the list so as to keep the chain of communications functioning. *** The MUFON Annual Corporate Meeting will be held Sunday morning, July 8, 1984, from 9 AM to noon in conjunction with the MUFON 1984 UFO Symposium. State and Provincial Directors or their assigned representatives should be prepared to submit both a short oral report and a more detailed written report on their annual activities and accomplishments. \" Reports will also be submitted by Staff members, Board of Directors, Continental Coordinators and Foreign Representatives. Please advise your .International Director immediately if. you want a particular subject or problem to be considered placed on the meeting agenda. *** In response to a request for either donations or equipment to set up a computer network, one of our officers has donated an ADDS Applied Digital Data Systems, . Inc. \"Regent 60\" terminal and a Ven-Tel model A/C 103 modem. (The A/C 103 has a maximum baud rate of 300). Leonard Sturm, State Director for Illinois, has shared important price data and his recommendations for equipment. Ken Hanke, a computer programmer at McDonnel Douglas in St. Louis, has been invited to write an article for the Journal with his suggestions and recommendations for people interested in utilizing computers in their UFO research. Dr. Hynek has suggested that.a computer workshop should be considered at the symposium in San Antonio. Other people who have written and proposed ideas are Allen Benz, Foundation for UFO Research; Robert W. Kassouf, Pennsylvania Association for the Study of the Unexplained; and Victor Laurenco in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. *** The membership response to former subscribers of Frontiers of Science has been fantastic. Upon receipt of their Journal subscription, each person is sent a membership application and invited to take an active role in MUFON based upon their personal interest, education, experience, and specialized talent. This is a public invitation to not only former Frontiers of Science subscribers, but to all MUFON members to become more involved in solving this scientific mystery, especially those who are \"Contributing Subscribers.\" Individu- ally there is a vast source of talent that (continued on next page) 17"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"Lucius Parish In Others' Words Henry Gris contributes another article on Soviet UFO activity in the April 24 issue of THE NATIONAL ENQUIRER. Pro'fessor Inyushin of the Soviet Academy of Sciences tells of the destruction caused in a Siberian forest on May 31,1983. It is theorized that the damage was caused by a malfunction- ing UFO. Unusual physiological effects were reported by scientists who visited the area. UFO sightings and cattle mutila- tions are the subject of a report in the May 15 ENQUIRER. Such events have been reported near the town of Norris, South Dakota, during February and March. Surely the editors of OMNI can come up with something more interesting and informative than the \"Anti-Matter/UFO Update\" columns of their two most recent issues. As mentioned in a previous column, the April issue contained Hynek's same old tired line. The May issue has a \"rejoinder\" by James Oberg, saying that \"we can account for decades of UFO sightings without resorting to extraordinary explanations.\" Anyone can be wrong, but must they also be boring at the same time? British Ufologist John Rimmer, editor of MAGONIA, has a new book in the series of titles being released by The Aquarian Press Limited. THE EVIDENCE FOR ALIEN ABDUCT- IONS covers much familiar ground, giving basic details of a number of contactee and abductee reports. Rimmer sums up what he considers to be evidence for and against the extraterrestrial explanation for UFOs, as well as giving pro and con points for abductions being of psychological origin. To anyone who has read MAGONIA, it is hardly surprising that his final conclusion is \"that the abduction experience is almost totally psychological in origin, and individual cases can be explained without recourse to extraterrestrial intervention.\" In my opinion, a far more logical approach to the abductions subject is the one adopted by Budd Hopkins. Once you have watched a subject \"re- live\" an abduction experience under hypnosis, you are likely to think twice before coming up with glib \"explanations\" for such incidents. Rimmer's book is available from the American distributor, Sterling UFO NEWSCL1PPING SERVICE The UFONEWSCLJPPING SERVICE will keep you informed of all the latest United States and World-Wide UFO activity, as it happens!

However, as Sherman J. Larsen, Chairman of the NICAP Board of Governors, has pointed out in a recent letter, they are reorganizing the NICAP case files for ready reference in response to an ever growing number of requests to research our files. Fees have been established for this service. The NICAP files cover the period from 1942 to 1981. Sherm has been working like a \"trooper\" to cleanup and reorganize the files since they were purchased from Jack Acuff as a means of perpetuating this valuable UFO information. Their major contribution to date has been the re-issues of earlier NICAP publications. They are The UFO Evidence by Richard H. Hall (previous- ly published in 1964,' 184 pages) and Strange Effects from UFOs by Gordon Lore (previously published in 1969, 80 pages). Prices for these two significant booklets are: The UFO Evidence (with a much-needed 60 page index) $16 postpaid within the U.S. and $17 outside and Strange Effects, $5.50 postpaid within the U.S. and $7 outside the U.S. They may be obtained by sending and making a check payable to NICAP, Sherman J.

The March 1984 issue of The Saturday Evening Post contained Part II of an article by Donald A. White titled \"Flying Saucers: Are They Us?\" starting on page 66. Mr. White refers to the work of several of MUFON's State Section Directors in Indiana in relation to the Lucky Point, Indiana (a few miles south of Terre Haute) continuing saga of sighting reports. Jerry Sievers and Kerry (Dean) Teverbaugh were the prime investigators. We thank Mr. White for his quotation when he acknowledges MUFON as \"the largest national and international UFO investigative organization.\" The April 10, 1984, edition of the National Enquirer carried an article titled \"Four of America's Most Amazing UFO Encounters\" on page 4 on cases previously published in the MUFON UFO Journal and investigated by MFUON people. (Please refer to the article in the February 1984 issue of the Journal titled \"The Enquirer and MUFON\" for details.) Considering that the Enquirer has 25 million readers, the response to our invitation for UFO sighting reports was not overwhelming. Due to the questionable UFO articles frequently published- in the Enquirer, this is obviously not an appropriate media to attract members of the scientific and intellectual community to become actively engaged in resolving the UFO enigma. However, some good reports requiring follow-up by investigators and new Journal subscribers were obtained through this cooperative survey. *** In recognition of her outstanding work as Chairperson of the National Public Information and Education Committee, Mrs. Marge Christensen has been promoted to Director of Public Relations and member of the Board of Directors, replacing Leonard H. Stringfield, who has held that post since 1975. As a worldwide authority, Mr. Stringfield will join the MUFON Staff, JOHN L. WARREN heading up the UFO Crash/Retrieval Committee, for which he is eminently qualified. Mrs. Christensen will also represent MUFON on the Public Relations Committee of the North American UFO Federation. *** After serving for five years as the Continental Coordinator for Australia/ New Zealand, Keith Basterfield asked to withdraw from this position to devote more time to personal commitments and increased work load. Keith has recommended Harry Griesberg of North Gosford, New South Wales, Australia, to be his replacement. Mr. Griesberg has held numerous UFO administrative positions in Australia. He is probably best known for having nurtured the Australia Coordination Section for CUFOS, managing for the first time to bring all major Australian organizations together for a national umbrella type organization. He has been editor/ publisher of the ACUFOS Journal besides being chief organizer and chairman of seven successful national UFO conferences. Keith has been an outstanding example of a Continental Coordinator through his constant communications from the continent \"down-under\" (Australasia). *** We are especially proud to announce the appointments of three new State Directors. Donald R. Schmitt, of Hubertus, Wisconsin, has accepted the responsibility to organize the state of Wisconsin. As a commercial artist, he is preparing the final rendition for the cover of the MUFON 1984 UFO Symposium Proceedings, designed by Tom Deuley. Don has done considerable public relations work in Wisconsin through lecturing and UFO investigations with his colleague, Richard Heiden. When Dr. Willy Smith retired and moved to Florida, this created a vacancy for a State Director. Edwin Myers, a former State Section Director in Atlants, Georgia, has agreed to fill the vacancy. Ed has a bachelor's degree in Journalism and is a professional filmmaker. Due to personal problems, Richard Caudell found it necessary to resign as State Director for New Mexico. John L. Warren, Ph.D., who previously held this position and now living in White Rock, New Mexico, has agreed to accept this assignment. John has been a Consultant in Physics since 1975 and is employed as an accelerator physicist at the Los Alamos Laboratory. For a State Director to be thoroughly effective, each has been encouraged to select an assistant state director. Bruce A. Widaman has appointed Kenneth A. Hanke, a computer programmer, to be the Assistant State Director for Missouri. Ken and his wife, Helen, are also Assistant Co-Chairpersons for the MUFON 1985 UFO Symposium to be held in St. Louis, hosted by the UFO Study Group of Greater St. Louis. Joseph C. Stewart, Assistant State Director for Michigan, has also been appointed to serve as State Section Director for Shiawassee and Clinton Counties by Dan R. Wright.
