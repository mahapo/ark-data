With that precaution, we dutifully present the Tyler, Texas, events of January 1979 involving reported UFO encounters, ornate UFOs right out of \"Project U.F.O.,\" and an admixture of parapsychological occurrences including \"messages.\" Dozens of questions spring to mind, but this is a preliminary summary reported by two well-qualified investigators — a medical doctor and an aerospace engineer, both employed by NASA. If ever a case cried out for intervention by behavioral and social scientists, this is it. The family dynamics, the personal values and attitudes of the protagonists, their mental or psychological health, all require intensive investigation, not to mention the supposedly measurable physiological aftereffects claimed by the witnesses. We hope there will be follow-up reports that will allow objective evaluation. It would be easy to dismiss the entire affair as fantasy, but that cannot legitimately be done without investigation.

By Dr Richard C. Niemtzow & John F. Schuessler (Project VISIT, Friendswood, Texas) May 1977 In May 1977, Ronnie Patrick (hereinafter referred to as Ron) saw two black figures with arms spread out, no facial features, no hands or feet, who were not touching the ground, who were taller than him, and growled loudly. He later saw a small, toeless footprint, with claws, which he covered up. Within one day Ron and his girlfriend saw a round metallic UFO, with blue lights. The UFO went into the lake without a sound. January 17, 1979 Ron was living with his grandmother in Quitman, Texas (north of Tyler), while working on a construction project in the area. He was awakened at 4:15 a.m. when a beam of light entered the room through the window and adjoining wall. He was dressed only in his shorts. He described the light as \"beautiful,\" white with a blue tint and sparkles. He touched the light repeatedly and it would \"go through\" his hand and arm. He said: \"It didn't hurt, but then I felt it was like static electricity.\" The next thing he remembered was sitting in a chair, fully dressed, at 7:00 a.m. He went immediately to work and worked until 5:30 p.m. Subsequently, he experienced a 25-pound weight loss, lost hair, experienced burning in the eyes, had dry nose and mouth, diarrhea, and perspired more than normal. He alternated between flashes of insight and loss of memory and had a lot of nightmares. His gums pulled away from his teeth and bled intensively. He feared the teeth would fall out. The conditons were verified by Mr. and Mrs. Patrick, Ron's parents. January 24, 1979 Confidential name (hereafter referred to as \"Scott\") had a recurring dream of a UFO encounter. On January 24,1979, at 10:00 p.m., he was driving home when his dream became a reality. He was about 4 miles from Lindale, Texas, at 10:15 p.m., when he stopped the car to relieve himself. He left the car running, lights on, and Peter Frampton tape cassette playing in the car. He saw a flash of light in the sky much like he had seen in the dream. The light was bright green and yellow, with sparks. This light hit him. A wind whirled around the car and his hair stood on end as if affected by static electricity. Then he saw two ships with a moving violet-red light between them. Later he found himself sitting in front of the car. The lights were on but the car was not running. He was scared, shaky, cold, and his stomach was in knots. He had a loss of memory and the next day the clock in the car was found to be 5% hours off. Scott heard a loud ring and the car turned on. He returned home at 5:30 a.m. where Ron was waiting for him. When Ron saw Scott he said Scott's hair was standing up, he was white, and appeared taller, but toothless* Scott appealed to Ron to hold him, but Ron was afraid to touch him. Scott appeared boneless and fell to the ground, whimpering. Later examination revealed a diamond-shaped burn, 5 inches across, on Scott's chest (see cover photo). He had holes in his pants and socks and into his shins on both legs. His hair was somewhat burned. The Peter Frampton tape had two minutes of silence on both sides. The whole event was quite traumatic for Scott's family. His sister had nightmares and became very frightened, so his father forbade him to talk about the event again. That same night Ron and his mother saw the UFO from the yard at his parents' home in Tyler. Then Ron went hunting for Scott. He drove to all the usual places but was unable to locate Scott. Then he went to Scott's house and waited for him to arrive (i.e., 5:30 a.m.) January 28, 1979 About 12:30 p.m. Ron was in his truck on Highway 69 near Tyler. He drove up a hill and pulled off the road. The UFOs appeared — the same as seen by Scott on January 24. They moved in a triangular pattern. Ron said it was like a \"3-D scene\" looking at the objects. They were a metallic color. A voice from the object talked to rtirn in English. The voice was robot type, like it was going through a translator machine. The voice said, \"We know your limitations, we mean no harm. We're here to help, not harm.\" They said they would be back. After the event Ron felt as if he could understand many new concepts. He admitted to being a \"slow\" student prior to the event. Now he plans to start college on a part-time basis in the fall of 1979. January 30, 1979 On Tuesday, January 30, Ron left Quitman, Texas, at 7:25 a.m., stopped at the 7-11 store at 7:29 a.m. and was in Oilman at 7:35 a.m. He had covered 30 miles in 6 minutes. He was checking the time carefully on his new highly accurate wristwatch. During this event his left arm was cut very deeply, (continued on next page) 3"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"(Texas Encounter, Continued) through the shirt sleeve, but somehow closed back up like it was glued together. There is an absence of hair in that area of the arm and a slight trace of the opening remains visible. Afterwards his arm was weak and discolored and burned whenever water touched it. His father verified the aftereffects of the incident. No UFO was seen at any time during the event. Summary Without the full and continued cooperation of both Ron and Scott it is impossible to draw firm conclusions from the information given to date. However, the most striking results of this case lie in the physical injuries sustained by the participants. In particular, the diamond-shaped discoloration on the chest of Scott has persisted for weeks. Initially it did peel in large heavy slabs, but did not fade away. The results of the cassette tape analysis are interesting, but need to be compared with other tapes similarly affected by UFOs. Ron Patrick and his parents, Gary and Shirley Patrick, have given their permission for the publication of this case, for scientific purposes. Their family unit has been disturbed by UFO close encounters and they want to help others to understand what is happening. Scott is trying to get his life back in order and to forget about the incident. He desires no publicity and will no longer cooperate in the investigation. The investigators believe that both participants should undergo regressive hypnosis to help remove the fear of the events and to reveal some possibly very important details of what happened during the periods of lost time. One cannot rule out fabrication in this type of case, however, it is the conclusion of this report that the participants have revealed the details truthfully and to the best of their ability.

Allan Hendry, chief investigator for the Center for UFO Studies, went to the scene the following day, and it is hoped that a full report will be forthcoming. This preliminary report is based primarily on an account in the Grand Forks, N.D., Herald on August 29, 1979, plus the Minneapolis, Minn., Star Tribune on August 31, 1979. About 1:40 a.m. on the morning of August 27, 1979, Deputy Sheriff Val Johnson was on patrol about 10 miles west of Stephen, Minnesota, in the northwest part of the state close to the North Dakota border. Johnson is a member of the Marshall County Sheriffs Department, Warren, Minn. The territory is flat agricultural land. He first saw a distant bright beam of light \"like a spotlight\" a few feet above the highway, which he first thought was aircraft landing lights, and drove toward By Richard Hall it to investigate. On Highway 220 just south of the intersection with County Road 5, the light or object suddenly was right on top of him (\"...when I got closer-boom!--it was right there. Just right now.\") Johnson heard glass breaking, the car interior was flooded with brilliant white light, and he lost consciousness. At 2:19 a.m., the official logs show, he revived and radioed for help. His dispatcher taped the call, in which Johnson exclaimed, \"Something attacked my car.\" Responding to the distress call, Deputy Sheriff Greg Winskowski found Johnson's car sideways on the road. He called an ambulance, and Johnson was taken to a hospital where he was treated for \"welder burns\" to his eyes and a bump on the forehead, probably from striking the steering wheel. Later, he was transferred to an eye specialist in Grand Forks, N.D. The Damage Deputies inspecting the car found one headlight smashed, a small round dent in the hood, a broken windshield, a broken red police light on the top, and two spring-mounted steel antennae bent over nearly 90 degrees. No evidence of any other vehicle was found. The car travelled 854 feet from the point of impact, at which point tire skid marks appeared for another 99 feet. Johnson's wristwatch arid the car clock, both of which had been carefully set for patrol purposes, both stopped for 14 minutes. According to an informal report, Johnson and Allan Hendry appeared on the ABC-TV program \"Good Morning America\" on September 11 where they discussed the incident with host David Hartman. • Hendry was quoted in the press as saying, \"It is a most incredible case, and there are some most unusual clues.\" Further details and results of follow-up investigations will be reported when available. \\ ££5 > Object sighted by Ron Patrick"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Physical Evidence and Animal Reactions ARGENTINE OIL FIELD LANDING (Editor's Note: The following excerpts are from Radiolandia 2000 magazine for May 25, 1979, Buenos Aires, Argentina.

Vizcacheras is located some 80 km from the capital of Cuyo (the Cuyo region involves San Juan and Mendoza Provinces, although each has its own capital-.-J.T.), and is one of the richest oil regions. There is an extensive area of many square kilometers being exploited by YPF (Yacimientos Petroliferos Fiscales —: Government oil fields). For security reasons it is a zone accessible only to technicians and workers of that company. That vast region is what might be called a real barren plain. The only approach road belongs to YPF; thus, since it is not a National Highway, nor a provincial or local one, it is only sporadically used by those who work nearby. Within the forbidden perimeter remain the \"estancias\" (large ranches) Las Tinajas, Los Cupiles, La Madrugada, and El Piquillin. In that wide and private oil strip, on May 1 at 4:00 a.m., a non-conventional flying object hovered noiselessly some 20 meters above the ground, after giving off multicolored lights. \"We woke up with the noise made by the goats in the corral,\" YPF engineers later said. \"We went outside with lanterns and working lamps. It was frightening, and we were paralyzed. There, some 70 meters from the encampment, as if hovering in the air, an enormous craft sent us intermittent lights. They were signalling.... \"After a few seconds the fear subsided and we felt a strange sensation of peace and curiosity. One of us took courage and made a wink with his lantern, which was answered at once. Then another did the same, with the same result....Then slowly, the craft landed. Very near. We didn't know what to do. One of us went running to the pickup truck and radioed the news .to Post No. 1, where the barrier is. Another tried to go near the craft alone (the others yelled at him to stop, and they again remained motionless- Editor.) Finally, after persisting with the exchange of light signals, that flying saucer or whatever you want to call it, climbed and was lost in the sky towards the mountains (the Andes-J.T.). It was 4:35 a.m.... Landing Traces \"We went to the place where it had been a few minutes before. We found a big petrified circle, but what most attracted our attention was that the sand had now turned into hard pieces, forming big tuffs (compacted chunks-- Editor)....We took them to Professor Corradi, a well-known university professor who is also director of the Institute for Extrahuman Studies.\".... (The magazine correspondent then interviewed Professor Corradi, who said that Bob Pratt of the National Enquirer had just been in his office. •• Editor) \"I have been noticing for some time that the permanent presence of the UFOs over the uranium mines of La Pintada and Cuesta de los Terneros in San Rafael and now in Vizcacheras, is not a coincidence,\" he said....\"I have just submitted several complete reports — because I was requested to do so. One went to the provincial police, another to YPF, and the other to the authorities. I'm now awaiting the results of the tests we asked the Office of Mining to perform on that sand turned into stone by the UFO.... \"Aside from the tuffs and the petrified circle, it is important to point out that the local animals have completely changed their behavior and customs from the moment the UFO appeared. The goats, more than 1,500 — which always returned to . their corrals after grazing as all the goats in the world do — did riot go back. Seagulls are appearing in the area, which settle on the YPF tanks, something completely unusual and disconcerting, for you know how many kilometers from here the sea is. (About 600 km-Editor.)

Wright (State Section Director for Michigan) At approximately 9 PM, October 5 or 6,1976, Mrs. J.F. of Patterson Road, a few miles south of Midland, Michigan, was home with her 17-year old daughter Lori. Crying and thoroughly rattled, Ann and Jan, 35-year old twin sisters and friends of Mrs. F. entered the house claiming they had just been chased by a flying saucer. Mrs. F. recalls that she was not immediately convinced that that was what was seen, since the sisters were easily excited and capable of embellishing a story. However, she was certain the sisters had been unnerved by something. After 5 minutes when the sisters had regained some of their composure, Rick F., 18, and his friends Karl Crocker, 16, and Mike Ginter, 18, arrived home. Rick states that he held a firm disbelief in UFO reports and so scoffed at the ladies. But when one showed signs of crying again and challenged the boys to see for themselves, they grew curious and decided to return along with Lori to the area to humor them. As instructed, the four drove 5 miles south on Patterson, then turned east onto Kent Road. Freshly harvested fields separated by this lines of woods and occasional houses made up this rural area. The youths had gone less than 3 miles on Kent when they passed one such line of trees opening onto perhaps a 100 acre open area, less than a mile southwest of the Consumer's Power Company nuclear plant then under construction. (Rick recalls that the components for two reactors were being installed during that time and the domes to cover them were yet to be erected.) Also in the immediate area of the large field—in fact crossing it—were high tension power lines on derrick- -type towers. One farmhouse along the road has a clear view of the field and Rick and Karl both recall seeing two farmers standing in the front lawn looking north. As he cleared a stand of trees, the open area came into view and he immediately spotted a large object some 250 yards into the field, approximately 300 feet above the ground. He cried out, \"Oh, my God, what is that!\" and brought the car to a halt, straddling the gravel road angularly in order to face the object. He states that he was excited but not frightened and on impulse began to flash his headlights to attract the object's attention. The night was clear but with little moonlight and Rick could only see a dim outline of the object, which he took to be either disc-shaped or oval and over 200 feet in diameter. It appeared to be about 20 feet from its flat underside to a somewhat sloping top, resembling a hamburger bun in shape. The rim was quite rounded. At no time during the sighting could he definitely conclude that the object was metallic, though he assumed as much. The only light initially was a large beacon centered on the bottom and illuminating a 100-foot area of the ground beneath in white light. Then Lori, seated in the rear left seat, began screaming in fright over Rick's flashing of the lights. Karl, in the rear right with the poorest view and possibly distracted by Lori's behavior, caught only a glimpse of the object during the first several seconds, which he described as a bright white light halfway up the the horizon similar to a mercury vapor light used on area farms. He states that the light was too high in the air to be such a yard light, and a check of the vicinity revealed no light pole. (It should be noted here that Lori and Mike, both with better views, have since moved out of state and are unable to be reached.) As Rick flashed his lights (no effects upon the auto's operation at any / l.kW/TT \\ LJGHT time), the beacon went out abruptly. After a one-second pause, a series of ten or more lights, multicolored and 2 feet in diameter, came on sequentially around the underside, a few yards inset from the perimeter. These included red, blue, yellow, green, and perhaps other colors. No pattern was noticed to the colors. Also, in the brief seconds before the craft rose up another 30 yards or so, Rick noticed a series of windows or lights approximately 1 foot high and 5 feet wide, on the upper portion just above and inset from the rim. There were 2-foot spacings between these. At this point the object moved laterally to the south, passing 50 yards in front of the car at about 20 mph and into an adjacent field, stopping about 100 yards away from the car. As it moved, Rick heard a low hum like that of a large boiler mixed with a hissing sound. Its height is uncertain when it halted in that Karl, with a better view now, believed it to be about half the size of a full moon, • disc-shaped, and . perhaps a few hundred yards in the sky. When it stopped momentarily, both Rick and Karl saw the object wobble or \"teeter\" for a few seconds. Then the multicolored lights blinked off simultaneously, replaced by other purple lights nearer the rim and smaller \"running lights,\" as Rick described them. Then the craft began to move west, the wobbling no longer present, and Rick believes the humm-hiss gained in pitch as it accelerated. He turned the car around and gave chase. But after a quarter mile, as the auto reached 80 mph, the craft was already a half mile ahead and outdistancing them easily. Within two minutes it was a pinpoint of light on the -western horizon and they gave up, returning home. The object's acceleration, Rick and Karl agreed, was (continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"(Michigan, Continued) • gradual with no sudden burst of speed, and must have been several hundred miles per hour as it faded into the distance. The entire sequence lasted about 5 minutes. Mrs. F. reports that the children returned home very excited, with Lori still visibly upset. The sisters had left the Fleminger residence on their way to the F. home when the experience began. When contacted, Mrs. Fleminger stated that she recalled the incident and believed her eldest son had viewed the craft from their home as well. Mrs. Fleminger also related two occurrences with a strange light and one apparently involving the same craft in the weeks preceding the above incident. No approximate dates are kown to her at this point. Mr. Fleminger, a milkman, was driving to work east on M-46 shortly after 3 AM sometime in August when a luminescent yellow light or shell, 3 feet in diameter and spherical, suddenly appeared in front of his car. After a second, it disappeared. In that the experience was so strange and fleeting, he did not mention it to anyone. Then, 2 or 3 weeks later, after Mr. Fleminger had left for work, Mrs. Fleminger was awakened by a light from outside. She went to the window and saw an identical yellow Jight circling a tall tree outside. It circled the tree six or seven times in about 20 seconds, then \"just disappeared.\" Upon awakening in the . morning, she wondered if it had been a dream. Nevertheless, she mentined it to her husband who then related his own experience before. Finally, perhaps two weeks before the primary incident, Mr. and Mrs. Fleminger returned home one evening about 9:30 to find their four children, aged 9 to 15, screaming and crying under the dining room table. They said a flying saucer had hovered and moved slowly outside the home, cascading a blue light in through the windows of the house, then shot away toward the southwest at terrific speed. One year following this series of incidents, Mrs. F. and her daughter Lori were involved in a second brief but very strange happening. At about 5:30 PM, October 15, 1977, the two were driving north on Patterson Road half a mile from home on their way to Midland to 8 do some shopping. This stretch of Patterson is lined on the left by a woods with dense underbrush at its edge. On the right is a soybean field bordered by a low fence, occasional bushy thickets and tall weeds. There are no houses or other buildings in the area. Two miles to the east is the Dow Chemical plant and the entire area is Dow property. As they were nearing Pine River Road, another rural gravel surfaced route, an unknown being leaped out onto Patterson from the right, its feet 4 feet or so in the air as it came down. Neither Lori, who was driving, nor her mother noticed it until it was about to land in the middle of the road. Awestruck, Lori slammed on the brakes, though they were still some 200 feet away. In the next second, the being leaped a second time across the remainder of the road as well as a deep gully and into the underbrush. Both are certain that the entity did not flex its knees or bend its legs in any way in accomplishing the latter jump which was also to a 4-5 foot height and at least 30 feet in length. Mrs. F. states that the being was approximately 5'6\", upright with a slender build, and a dull smooth black color from head to foot. She recalls two legs, though she says these may not have been jointed by reason of the stiff- legged spring. She noticed a torso, neck, and head of normal human proportions. She did not recall seeing any arms, stating these may have been tucked or held to the sides. The legs did not spread apart as it leaped. \"It really had the build of a slender teenage boy,\" she recalls. While it may have had dark smooth fur, her better guess is that the creature wore \"a black wetsuit, like divers wear.\" Lori immediately remarked that it leaped like a kangaroo, though of course its structure was not at all similar. The being did not turn to face them and so no facial features were garnered in the 2 seconds or so that they viewed the entity. Neither did they spot a backpack or other device by which the being could propel itself so far from a standstill. After it disappeared into the woods, Mrs. F. yelled at Lori to drive forward to the spot. They were too frightened to get out of the car, saw nothing as they approached, and so continued on. A final note: Rick F. states that sometime in May of this year, before his friend Mike Ginter relocated to Arizona, Mike related seeing another disc-shaped craft of smaller proportions than the one viewed in October 1976, hovering over Patterson Road about a mile south of the F. residence. As he approached in his car, the craft abruptly flew off laterally to the west. No other details are available concerning that sighting. Scientist Says UFO Landed In Philippines (The following report was published in the Albuquerque, N.M., Journal and other newspapers on May 22, 1979.- Editor) D'AVAO, Philippines (UPI) —An American scientist said Sunday he and 600 villagers saw an unidentified flying object emitting flashes of light whiz over the Philippines' highest peak and land near their huts. Ron Kruppa, 36, of the American- based Film and Research for the Endangered Environment, told Davao officials he saw a round object moving over Mount Apo, at the edge of Davao, 600 miles south of Manila. \"As I looked into the sky to find out why the eagles were making an eerie sound, I noticed an unusually bright starlike object in the north but almost directly overhead,\" said Kruppa. The object was perfectly round like a big balloon\" and gave off a strobe-like effect similar to one produced by a camera flash, he said. He-also said he noticed objects moving -inside the UFO with x his binoculars, as if pictures of the surroundings were being taken. The UFO landed in an open space behind a cluster of trees at upper Baracatan, and the frightened villagers ran into their huts, he said. Twenty minutes later, the object took off and disappeared in the sky, he said."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"\"RIDDLES OF THE PLANET EARTH\" (Translation of ISVESTIA Supplement on UFO Reporting, Dated 15 January 1979 Nedelya-No. 3) Note: Under the heading \"Riddles of the Planet Earth\" are two articles, one by two Soviet scientists on unexplainable things in the sky, the second by an editorial writer (fem.) V. Popova on Atlantis. The two scientists are V. Miguiin, Corresponding Member, Academy of Sciences, USSR, and U. Platov, Candidate Physical- Mathematical Sciences.-Editor Not long ago I observed an unexplainable phenomenon in the sky. In the southern portion of the sky a bright body flew past giving off strong luminescence. This did not resemble a falling meteorite or the flight of a lightening bolt or rocket. What could ( this have been? I wanted to know what scientists think of this.-V. Petrov City of Kujbyshev Reports about various unusual phenomena in the Earth's atmosphere came to the Academy of Sciences of the USSR. The authors of these letters seek an explanation of their nature, and many comment on a variety of rumors about unidentified phenomena. In recent years sufficient factual material has been accumulated, as well as primary processing/work-up (of data) conducted, that it is now possible to draw some preliminary conclusions and answer several questions. First of all it ought to be noted that the very term/phrase \"unusual/sing- ular/uncommon\" (NEOBYCHNOE) or \"anomalous\" phenomenon is sufficiently subjective so that frequently known natural phenomena seem/ appear unique to an insufficiently trained observer. The authors of the reports are people from completely diverse backgrounds, therefore, their information even about one and the same phenomenon is indeed heterogeneous and further not always coincides with the true picture. Reports of distinctly interesting events are relatively infrequent. From abundant information one can separate (happenings) into two basic groups: local phenomena having an aspect of formations of various geometrical forms with comparatively sharp outlines, immobile or moving along various trajectories; and global phenomena which can be observed simultaneously over a large territory having sufficiently large angular dimensions and representing complex processes with a whole complex of lighting effects. Astronomical objects are among the observable phenomena most often attracting peoples' attention. Traces of not large meteorites each one of us has seen at least one and hardly consider them anything anomalous. And there are bright meteors, or fire balls, that occur a great deal less often and produce a strong impression even on the experienced observer, because they are accompanied by a dazzling spectacle, lasting minutes, and sometimes even tens of minutes. Not infrequently the bright planets can startle one by their appearances. These planets, especially Venus, are observed in the morning or evening hours in the background of a relatively light sky, •when the stars are not visible, produce an impression of some kind of enigmatic shining body. If at the same time there is haze on the planet it is visible through scattered clouds, the impression grows and the movement of the clouds can create an illusion of motion. To this class of phenomena one must relate the movement of an artificial earth satellite, and moreover the dazzling spectacle occurring as they bum up in the denser layers of the atmosphere. In Earth's atmosphere natural conditions often arise in which various kinds of anomalies can be observed. Lenticular cloud formations, characteristics of a mountainous region, are related to these. When these appear over the plains country/flat land, a distinctly unusual spectacle confronts the people of these locales. Here might it also be mentioned the various kinds of optical effects connected with local or larger scale changes in the conditions of refraction of light in the atmosphere. They can be the cause of the appearances of all manner of halos, false astronomical objects, mirages. But most of all the attention of witnesses is attracted to various sounders and experimental balloons. The length of the lines of such spherical sounders can reach sometimes hundreds of meters; their air bags can take odd forms, and sparkling in the rays of the sun at an altitude up to 20 kilometers present an unusual picture. The Aurora Borealis is well known, arising in the middle and even now and then at lower latitudes; or the effects connected with scientific experiments conducted in the upper layers of the atmosphere or in the ionosphere. But in the given case we are speaking about something else. To the number that have not yet been explained are those vividly bright events observed in the Petrozavodsk district in September 1977. The very scale of that event — the Helio physical situation, a whole series of analogous phenomena (occurring) in the same district; it is possible that these are related to the Petrozavodsk phenomena above with the changes of physical conditions that happened at the same time in the upper layers of the Earth's atmosphere, and in part in the ionosphere. It is, however, too early to draw results. Perhaps the impression is being created that there is no interest in the investigation of anomalous phenomena. It hardly seems likely that everything hasn't been explained and (continued on next page) 9"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"(ISVESTIA, Continued) that therefore nothing in particular is to be observed. But that is just not so. There is sufficiently reliably recorded phenomena which do not accord with any known physical process. But we do not see any grounds for sensationalism in this; rather it is necessary to investigate just what this phenomenon is. Because anomalous phenomena have been known for a while, enthusiasts often undertook efforts to collect and report factual material about their observations. To an extent various authors succeeded in doing this. However, during selection of the material and the analysis, in our view, serious mistakes were committed that lead to rash conclusions. However, this has been written about frequently and there is no need to enter into polemics with the authors of these sensational lectures and to point out their failings. In the organizations .of the Academy of Sciences, USSR, in the course of several years investigations have been conducted of various anomalous phenomena in the atmosphere, the aim of which is to get reliable objective data about these processes and physical conditions that bring them about. In this connection, the complexity of the task as well as the work being of a complicated character require the participation of various types of specialists analyzing in depth and from all standpoints the helio- geophysical situation. We take this opportunity to make several recommendations to those who may observe unusual phenomena of various kinds. First, attempt to explain on the site (in scientific departments, or education institutions, with scholars) whether the thing seen is an astronomical or other quite well known object. Second, if it is explained as something unknown, along with its qualitative description try to give its quantitative characteristics. Address for reports: Department of General Physics and Astronomy, Academy of Sciences, USSR, Jeninsky Prospeckt No. 14, MOSCOW 117071 CE-III ENCOUNTER IN ARGENTINA By Professor Oscar A. Uriondo (Submitted by Fred Merritt, translation by Lex Mebane. Original source is Revista Atom, Buenos Aires, No. 4, June 1974, pp. 7-10. Professor Uriondo is publisher of a catalogue on Argentine landing cases, 1972.) A fortuitous circumstance allowed us to hear about this matter, and through the channel of Dr. G. H. (professor on the staff of various faculties of the University of Buenos Aires) to get in touch with his sister. S'ra. Maria Luisa G. H. de A., the witness to the landing of an OVNI (UFO). Married and the mother of a little girl, although she was born in Spain, she has been residing for some time in this country. A professor of history on the Faculty of Philosophy and Literature at the University of Buenos Aires, she is also a concert pianist and has made performing tours under the auspices of official cultural institutes. It was precisely on one of those tours when she had that UFO experience (the first and only one of her life). She was, and still is, uninterested in occult matters and \"flying saucers.\" After her observation, she attended some conferences on this subject, but she has not read any book about them. Her personality is not in the least inclined toward mysticism, she is a realist, with a healthy sense of humor. She gives the impression of being a responsible person, well-balanced and cultured. In the early morning of December 28, 1954, this lady was traveling, together with a group of Spanish artists, on Route #143, which connects San Rafael with Mendoza. They had all been taking part in the inauguration of a radio station in the first of these two cities, and were going to the capital of the province to appear on television. There were in all seven persons, traveling in a Packard car. They had dined very late (later than 2 AM) and were talking about various matters, in no way concerned with UFOs or the supernatural. It was. approximately 0330 when suddenly one of the travelers called their attention to 10 an illumination which could be seen on the side of the road at their right. At first they thought it was a bonfire, but they found immediately that that was not the case. A luminous object emitting a bluish light (like the flame of pure alcohol, or that of a welding torch) had placed itself in a field 150-200 meters away. The night was very clear, the sky was cloudless, and the topography of the place was completely flat, which permitted excellent visibility. Big As a Bus The UFO had the form of two superimposed deep dishes united at the' edge. Its equatorial flange emitted the bluish light (which illuminated the whole object) together with a kind of mist. It impressed them as something quite solid and material, although they could not make out in it any structural details (either doors or windows). It was of large size, \"like an omnibus\", the witnesses remarked. The light emanating from it did not at any time dazzle them. The witnesses stopped the automobile, got out of it, and went up to the object, walking through the vineyards. When they were at a distance of approximately half a block, they noted that near the object there were two human figures. One was standing and the other was squatting. - Their garments consisted of a one- piece diver's suit or overall of a dark color, which had an extension covering the head with a kind of hood, like those used by workers in iron foundries. Besides, it seemed to them that their faces were covered by a transparent material like mica, but they could not make out any facial details. The individual who was squatting stood up, and both beings entered the object by a sort of sliding door, like a dark rectangle opening against a luminous background. To enter it they lifted their feet very high, as if there were a sill or as if the door was at a certain height. The height of the two mysterious beings was that of a man of medium stature, and they appeared well-formed. The witnesses could not succeed in (continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"(Argentina, Continued) distinguishing their arms, and they moved rigidly. When they closed the door, the object began to send out smoke, gas, or steam through its equatorial region. At the same time, in complete silence, it rose up vertically (like an elevator) and remained about 2 meters above the ground. Then two lights went on (one at the top, the other at the bottom) at a certain distance from the body of the OVNI. These lights went on and off alternately; the witnesses supposed that they must be on antennae, though these were not visible. Alarmed, the witnesses went back to the automobile without taking their eyes off the craft, which began to make a series .of zigzag maneuvers, with' abrupt stops (remaining stopped in the air), and at acute angles, of 30° in one case, they estimated. They all got back in the car and started to drive away at high speed. The OVNI began to follow them, first on one side and then on the other, or else directly above them. While they were being followed, they saw a number of trucks and cars stopped along the road, their occupants having got out to watch the OVNI. In the first hours of dawn and in the slight mist that comes up at that time, they no longer saw it, although they could not understand how it had disappeared, and for a time they thought that the planet Venus (which was very brilliant) was the object •continuing to follow them. The total length of their sighting had been at least half an hour, perhaps even an hour. When they reached Mendoza, the impresario of the group suggested to them that in order to eliminate the possibility of a hallucination, they should all rest for a while, and meet later on to give independently each one's version of the experience they had been through. This they did, and all the descriptions were essentially identical, except for the words used. In view of the nature of the professional activity of all the participants, it was decided not to inform the press of the episode, so as to avoid its being thought that it was a publicity stunt. However, Senora Maria Luisa G. H. de A. telephoned that day to her mother to tell her about the hapening, so impressed was she by UFO TECH NOTE LIFE IN THE UNIVERSE By John F. Schuessler The universe is so large and contains so much of the same materials throughout it that life could have developed near many stars. Indeed, we know with certainty that living systems evolved on at least one tiny chunk of water-covered rock in a remote corner of the Milky Way galaxy. Why, then, could life not have developed elsewhere? Do civilizations exist in other parts of the universe? Could they have developed a technology similar to that on Earth? Do other worlds exist nearby that could be visited? Whence might visitors come? Could we establish communication with these civili- zations? Or should we? Questions about the possibility of intelligent life elsewhere in the universe are exciting, intriguing'and, for some people, frightening. Indeed, the discovery of other advanced civilizations could have profound effects on nearly all human affairs. What you have been reading is the introduction from a brochure by George Miller - LIFE IN THE UNIVERSE. As one might guess from this introductory material Mr. Miller is interested in contacting some form of intelligent life somewhere \"out there.\" Unfortunately, the brochure takes a cavalier attitude towards UFOs. But then, it does not pretend to be pro- UFO, or even \"skeptical.\" The author is fair in his statements where he adds qualifiers such as \"by any means we now know.\" All in all, LIFE IN THE UNIVERSE is well written, easy to read, and should be carefully studied by all UFO researchers.

It could be compared (as she expressed it) with the impression made on her by the birth of her first child. The unanimous opinion of the observers was that they were looking at an aerial machine, not a terrestrial or aquatic one. It gave the feeling of enormous power, with its incredible movements, in defiance of gravity and of inertia. The witnesses at first were not afraid, but only curious. They became alarmed only when the UFO began to follow them. Conclusions This sighting possesses a high coefficient of strangeness, because the observers had such a close view of the object, the richness of details perceived, and the favorable visibility conditions, as well as in the prolonged duration of the sighting, the result being to minimize the possibility that the witnesses could have confused it with any conventional artifact. With respect to the index of reliability, it is our opinion that the report of the lady mentioned above deserves to be accepted, not only as to her veracity (there is no real reason to suspect any fraud, because that would not agree with the witness's character nor with the significant fact that for many years she told her story only to close relatives), but also as to its accuracy, at least in the essential data maintained for almost a year after the first interview. On the other hand, vhere , are negative aspects: on one hand the long time elapsed since the occurrence of the incident, which may have distorted the details of the case by a natural lapse of memory, and on the other hand the impossibility of comparing the report of Sra. Maria Luisa G. H. de A. with that of the other witnesses, since none of them are at present, in this country. 11"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"HOW TO \"HEAR\" AND \"FINGERPRINT\" UFO LIGHT By Russ Reardon op 6 Excitation Wavelength, nm O Figure 1. UFO light \"fingerprint\" as printed out by photomultiplier pen countour plotter A commercially available electronic device, a photomultiplier, could take us a lot further down the UFO road by identifying the origination of its light. For example, when focused on a glowing light bulb the photomultiplier not only correctly identifies the source of excitation wavelength as tungsten on its meter, but also draws the individual tungsten \"fingerprint\" on its pen drop contour plotter-recorder (Fig. 1). I should like to know that 24-hour ground bases (and airborne) equipped with this would be operational where so many UFOs are sighted. The photomultiplier is waiting to contribute to the solution of a baffling enigma. Tungsten and the hundreds of other light sources each have set wavelengths of light emission (Angstroms). They are easily detected and fingerprinted by this equipment. Even holograms. Thus when pointed at a UFO, the source chemical element 12 (or whatever) causing UFO red, blue, orange, white, or green light, would be identified, contour mapped, and heard. Heard? Yes! A photomultiplier can be hooked up to an audio-amplifier which converts light vibrations-per- second into sound. And each light source has its own individual tone or hum on the musical scale. So as a UFO changed colors, it would literally write its own song! And since we could then \"hear the light,\" it might help us see the light, so to speak. I expect a photomultiplier with its moving finger to paint out a lot of the mystery amidst those unknown lights. The results would almost amount to physical evidence. The only trick would be to \"be there\" with this equipment. The photomultiplier is available in the United States from EMR Photoelectric, Princeton, NJ 80540 (image dissector. detector system Model 658A); or from Nye Optical Co., Spring Valley, CA 92077 (spectral range from below 2000 to above 7700A). The photomultiplier with the pen drop plotter (Fig. 2) is an Amino- Bowman Spectrophotofluorometer Catalogue No. 4-8106.* Audioampli- fiers are available from the Fisher or the Edmunds electronics supply catalogues. These assemblies with their proven fact-finding potential should be added to our arsenal of motion pictures, videotapes, still photos, radar scans, computer enhancements, etc., of UFOs. Only when all these techniques are added will we get off square one. *Both the increment of the excitation wavelength and the scanning speed of the fluorescence are manually adjustable. In this way, the entire excitation vs. fluorescence wavelength domain will be scanned within 10-15 min. The photomultiplier will sense the .emission intensity level at every point in the scanned wavelength domain.

Prior to today all of the reports had concerned a sighting the night of Aug. 2. However, today's sighting was made by at least three persons. Jim Tiller of McCook said he and his cousin, John Bartels, were bringing two loads of corn into McCook when they spotted a small object, which appeared to be about one to two feet across, zip across in front of them. Tiller said the object was round, had a blue top, shiny silver bottom and little blue lights on it. He said the object also had a dome on It. He said the object was about 30 feet off the ground and came from the west, across' U.S. 13 and headed east. The incident happened near the Bison Drive-In Theater. Tiller said he Immediately called Bartels, who was driving the truck behind him, on the business radio and asked him if he had seen the object. Bartels confirmed he had also. Tiller said there was a pickup truck in front of him. and it was obvious those in the pickup also saw the object as they slowed and watched it He said he did not know those in the pickup. Tiller said the object crossed the highway just in front of his truck. He added there was quite a bit of traffic on the highway and he was not able to stop to watch the object further. 13"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"I\" By Ann Druffel UFO SIGHTINGS BY UFO RESEARCHERS: THE \"INACCESSIBLE CASES\" — PART I In every statistical study of UFOs there is reference to the \"inaccessible cases\" — those which have never been reported to official sources or even related within earshot of a competent UFO investigator. The number of these cases has been estimated to be about nine times the number which have surfaced. In other words, only about one out of ten sightings is available for study. There are many reasons why these hundreds of thousands of inaccessible cases have not seen the light of day. Perhaps the witnesses have been afraid of ridicule or are naturally shy; perhaps some were disinterested or too frightened of the event itself to even consider reporting it. Others, in governmental service at the time of sighting, have been officially silenced. Others simply did not know where to report them. There is one considerable group of witnesses to whom none of the above reasons should apply, and yet they do not come forward to tell their experiences. These persons, keeping enigmatic silence, are UFO researchers themselves. Out of the dozens of UFO researchers in my acquaintance, I would estimate less than 25 percent have spoken out publicly to tell of their own personal sightings, even though some of the reports are of high strangeness and considerable potential value. Why are UFO researchers reluctant to speak out? Only one of the reasons stated above should be valid in this situation, that is, official silencing for security reasons; but even this reason is not wholly valid, as the U.S. Air Force has stated publicly that no UFO information is classified. UFO researchers should not fear ridicule, demonstrate shyness, disinterest or fear, and they certainly cannot claim they did not know where 14 to report it! So why should this situation exist? It is my opinion that many researchers fail to speak out for yet another reason — that they consider their sightings highly personal and, in some way, related to their own intense desire to investigate the UFO phenomenon. A vital clue to the UFO mystery might be found if we can study enough cases in which UFOs have appeared to persons who later, at great expense of time, energy, money and emotional harrassment, attempt to study them. It is with this firm conviction that I state the following: In the summer of 1945, in late June or July, to the best of my recollection, I was working as a secretary in downtown Long Beach, Califprnia. I had completed my freshman year of college and planned to return in September. This summer job was to help pay the inevitable expenses connected with a college education! Sometime after 5:00 o'clock in the afternoon, I boarded a bus in downtown Long Beach, rode north to State Street (now Pacific Coast Highway) and then east toward Cerritos Avenue. About one mile from Cerritos I saw out of the left-hand window of the bus a bright, unflickering, yellowish-white light in the northeastern sky. It was at about 60 degrees elevation and seemingly stationary. It seemed at very high altitude. It was still broad daylight, being summer at 34 degrees North latitude. The sky was very blue and cloudless; it was before the days of \"smog.\" Because the light was stationary, it was plainly not a relfection off an airplane and I became curious about it. It was definitely not an astronomical object, either, for I was well acquainted with celestial objects, having been deeply interested in astronomy since the age of nine. The light had no definite shape, but seemed somewhat more than a point source. It had somewhat the appearance of a daytime Venus, but much more yellow in color, and at least two times larger and brighter. I got off the bus and walked a half block south down Cerritos to my home (1742), frequently turning to watch the object, which still seemed motionless. Intrigued, I watched it from my front yard for some minutes and became aware that it was moving very slowly toward the northwest in a straight line across my line of vision. Finally convinced that it was strange and unlike anything .that \"belonged\" in the sky, I got my mother, Mrs. William (Aileen) McElroy, to come out and watch it. We gazed at it for a few minutes together. My vision was excellent, both far and near, and my mother had very good far vision. She agreed that it was indeed strange. She had never seen anything like it before, but suggested that it might be some kind of a military device, perhaps a balloon associated with Coastal defenses. World War D was still raging in the Pacific at that time, and Long Beach was in an essentially strategic position. My mother's reassurance took away some of the awe which the object produced in me, but I could not logically accept her explanation, the object was far too high to be a coastal defense balloon, at least any kind with which I was acquainted. I continued to watch it. My mother, being a practical and busy person, went into the house to prepare dinner. Sometime after six o'clock, still in broad daylight, the object had moved 15 to 20 degrees across the northern sky, from north-northeast to north- northwest, maintaining an elevation of (Continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"(California Report, Continued) about 60 degrees. When I had been watching it for about one hour and a half, it suddenly seemed to take on \"activity.\" Pieces of light, the same color as the object, began separating from it. My instantaneous thought was, \"It's starting to break up!\" The \"pieces,\" however, did not fall toward the ground as under normal influence of gravity. Instead, they took slow, deliberate paths out, up, and away from the object on both sides. None came down straight toward the earth — all were in curved paths up and away from the sides. There were at least 10 to 15 \"pieces,\" or small objects, and perhaps, more. Each was about 20-30 times smaller than the main object, and the main object was in no way diminished in size by their departure. Each of these smaller objects faded from view after they reached a distance several diameters away from the larger object. This occurrence greatly awed me, and I felt very frightened as well. It was completed inexplicable to me why the \"pieces\" should act as they did. It seemed as though I was seeing the reflection of the sun off tiny objects which \"rolled\" or changed position in relationship to the sun, and that when they disappeared from sight it was because they were no longer reflecting light. Each \"piece\" was the apparent size of a small star (in the nighttime sky). I rushed inside and told my mother what was happening, managing to blurt out that \"pieces were coming off but weren't acting as if gravity was acting normally on them.\" I begged her to come and watch it with me. She was busy with the cooking and refused to come out again. It did not even occur to me to report the object to any authorities. I was so awed and fearful that I would not go out alone to resume watching. The fear was irrational, looking back on it, for the activity in the sky plainly had nothing to do with the war, or coastal defenses, nor did it seem to present any danger to humans below it. The frightened feeling, however, stayed with me for several hours. Some days or weeks later, the first atomic bomb was detonated over Hiroshima. I was fascinated with the initial account in the paper, although I understood only a little of the technical explanations accompanying the article. But I felt the identical kind of awe and fear while reading about the atomic bomb as I had felt earlier while watching the object. Why the two seemingly separate events should produce identical reactions was beyond my comprehension, and I made no speculation whatsoever about it even to myself. I tried to tell a few friends about the object my mother and I had seen but was laughed at, and the event was treated lightly even by my family. I stopped talking about it, then gradually stopped wondering about it, and the event slowly faded from conscious memory. When flying saucers became public news in 1947, I instinctively thought of the strange object again but did not connect it in any way with the objects which were being reported. often in the newspapers. From time to time during the ensuing years,, the memory of the inexplicable object with its strange \"activity\" came to mind, but it never occurred to me to do anything about it. In no way was it linked to the \"flying saucer\" phenomenon in my mind. Several years after the end of World War II, the history of the first atom bomb was published in various papers and magazines. I gradually realized that the initial experimental atomic explosion over New Mexico had taken place in the general time period that I saw the object in the sky. Concurrent with this slow realization, I began to speculate that the main brilliant object and its \"pieces\" resembled in many respects the UFOs known as \"carrier craft\" or \"mother ships\" with their attendant smaller satellite discs. I began to form a rather firm theory that perhaps what I had witnessed was a large \"carrier craft,\" high in the stratosphere, or even in actual orbit around the earth, and that the small pieces were UFOs scouting the United States for information regarding the experimental New Mexico atomic explosion. These realizations, and interconnections of events, took years . HAZY EDGES \"LINES\" RESEMBLING BOMB-BAY DOOR BOTTOM VIEW to form. I began to actively investigate Southland UFO reports for NICAP in 1957, but it was several years after that that any meaningful conscious memory of the 1945 object began to be linked with the July 1945 New Mexico explosion and the possibility that the object was a \"carrier craft.\" When the realization finally surfaced strongly in the later 1960s, I began to wonder if my 1945 experience had \"set me up\" for an acceptance of UFO reports in 1947.1 was skeptical, of course, of some of the early reports, but my instinctive curiosity was far more intense than most of my friends and acquaintances. I kept an open mind about the sightings while others were laughing at or ignoring them. Had the 1945 sighting been a prelude or a catalyst of some sort to the overwhelming interest I've had for more than 22 years in the UFO phenomenon? I've mentioned this occurrence only in a few public lectures, but have never put it in print except as a short \"anonymous\" sample case in a newspaper article about SKYNET. It seems time, however, for investigators and researchers to come forward and relate their own UFO experiences. Perhaps rheir sightings have added value above those of the lay public, for it seems that experiences of these sorts \"condition\" certain people to actively research the UFO phenomenon. (In Part II next month, I will discuss the attempts made to identify the 1945 object, including use of a controversial hypnotic technique.) 15"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"BOOK REVIEW Messengers of Deception, by Jacques Vallee (Berkeley, Calif.: AND/OR Press, 1979) I have been a student of UFOs for 11 years. In those years I've seen the subject slowly gain respectability and amass a solid core of widely known and credible researchers. An immense amount of solid data has been accumulated and catalogued, the kind of data that a physicist or an engineer can sink intellectural teeth into. The kind of data that can inspire a psychologist or parapsychologist to seek a wider vision of human definition and functioning. The study of UFOs has come a long way from the time when Giant Rock conventions were nearly the sole image many had of people who trafficked in \"flying Saucers.\" Now this book has come along and I believe it genuinely threatens to tarnish and eventually erode that hard won respectability and progress. In this day of media hype this book may turn out to be very influential. If so, it would be a great setback for ufology. Messr. Vallee just may be one of the hottest new talk show guests around. If this occurs, then what has been restricted to a handful of esoteric UFO researchers may become common intellectual currency: planetary paranoia. Strong words? Perhaps, but no stronger than the words of the book itself. The book's greatest appeal will be for those ignorant of the UFO data. Given the general ignorance of the data by the public and the even worse ignorance on the part of academia, the book will either be seen as a new and compelling fabric of truth or more likely as a . nearly pathological tissue of nonsense. Most in academia will regard the book as paranoia piled upon pipedreams. The public will begin to incorporate UFOs into Frankenstein, Dracula, and monsters from the Id- science fiction horror films of the 1950's. The book, in essence, is a 16 disaster for the serious treatment of UFOs by either the public or academia. The only people who may be quite happy about the effects of this book are hidden in the national intelligence community. The arguments of the book are subtle. The subtlety, I believe, is the sense of vague, obscure, and almost formless assumptions being taken behind the scenes of a seemingly rationalistic structure. In what some have said is a traditional Gallic weakness, logic is taken to its ultimate conclusions of ultimate absurdity and reason is left in the lurch. As in a paranoidal rationality, the structure is finely worked out but rests upon seriously flawed assumptions that, however, cannot be disproven even though those assumptions be even insane in nature. What are UFOs according to the book? Vallee says, \"machines of mass manipulation.\" UFOs are basically some sort of psychic TV sets that go around interacting with humans for the sole purpose of conditioning behavior and injecting new beliefs that will destroy our present civilization. The Kremlin would love to have them, they are a type of psychic chameleon that can assume many guises, all of which are false and obscure their true nature. Vallee is never quite clear as to what their \"real\" nature is. Lately they assume the appearance of spacecraft down to the minutest details. It's all part of the monstrous deception that they seem to leave landing gear imprints and even malfunction occasionally in a quite mechanical way. What is behind this deceptive psychic camouflage? It is a mysterious worldwide agency or group out to fool the entire human race into believing it is being visited by spacecraft from other worlds. This gigantic ruse is a plot to introduce other hidden changes into our world that will eventually bring down the present world power structure. Just who or what this mysterious group really is, is not clear at all. Of course this is true because they have hidden themselves with such diabolical cleverness and have such powers of deception and concealment. All this somehow seems clinically familiar, or at least it might seem so to psychiatrists. What this psychic cryptocracy intends to do is never explicit either. That they intend to do \"bad\" things and take us over eventually in some way is indicated, though. At times the suggestion seems to be that this group is of relatively recent vintage. At other places the suggestion is that the plot is ancient. The quite fantastic continuity of aspects of the UFO data invites some pretty anthropocentric conclusions. What are we to make of data that seems to indicate, according to such things as cave paintings of UFOs near Lascaux, France, that some .UFOs haven't changed in thousands of years? What are we to make of what seem to be spacesuited figures clearly drawn on rocks in the African desert many many thousands of years ago? What are we to make of clearly humanoid reports and technological details from UFO reports hundreds of years ago? Are we to really assume that this deception began thousands of years ago and then knew the correct technological items to put into the camouflage? The deception becomes as monstrous in its complexity as Ptolemaic cycles and metacycles became monstrously complex to describe the motions of the heavenly bodies. Vallee's explanation is a type of Ptolemaic needless complexity inviting Occam's ever sharp razor.

Why? Why simulate humanoids on an island named Bora Bora and even go to the trouble of having the humanoids steal the natives' rabbits and have them hear the squeals of the little critters as they are taken aboard the \"fake\" UFO? The book is filled with the loaded questions representative of paranoia. \"Why is the picture we can form of their world closer to medieval concepts of Magonia, the magical land above the clouds, than to descriptions, of planetary environments?\" Who asserts this? Certainly the cases of Derenberger, Apodaca, Walton, Higdon, and Hill, to name only a few, come closer to describing visitors to earth employing advanced technology to ensure their successful entry and departure from our sphere. Another loaded assumption is that conditioning is contradictory with the interstellar angle; Why does this have to be so? It doesn't demand any extraordinary logic to imagine an interstellar agency concerned with preventing cultural shock gradually conditioning us to their presence by a long-term program of gradually increasing UFO sightings. But because of the often drastic personal psychological effects of a UFO sighting Vallee concludes that then UFOs must only be a control system. The possibility that the effects of UFOs are merely secondary isn't considered. This is as absurd as saying that the drastic effects that World War D technology had in creating the cargo cults : in the South Pacific was the primary purpose behind the American presence there. We were there as part of a control system to change mass belief systems, according to Vallee's logic. Vallee states again and again that it is evident UFOs are aiming to change political and social structures and to divert attention from human problems. Again this is mind reading. The big question is, why do UFOs appear so infrequently in our realm. Why not appear in vastly greater numbers and divert vastly greater attention from human problems? Judging from the newspaper headlines of late, UFOs have been singularly unsuccessful in diverting much attention from pressing problems of SALT or gas lines. Perhaps that is because \"they\" precisely don't want to divert us from the human problem-solving process. In arguing against the spacecraft hypothesis all the oldest and hoaryist cliches of Sagan and company are trotted out: that space visitors would rarely visit us, and so on. We are moments away from a flimsy biplane traveling a few feet and an instant away from a flimsy firespouting lunar expedition, and on that basis assumptions are made about civilizations that may be virtually stellar in their duration. The only honest scientific approach is empirical. They are here as often as they are here. We can't reject the numbers on the basis that they are unreasonable according to our present state of massive ignorance. For all we know the galactic tourist bureau considers earth a real hot spot and runs 20 tourist trips a day through here. Too many landings? On what' basis? According to the book, either UFOs select witnesses or appearances are staged. No other choices are given. UFOs that may fade in full view of witnesses (perhaps in his terms \"victims\") are obviously psychic confabulations and that's that. Why isn't it considered that UFOs may be physical craft that can manipulate light around themselves rendering themselves largely invisible or be using a controlled teleportation process- spacetime field changes? That shouldn't be too hard to understand after seeing such movies as \"Star Wars.\" If the UFO fading is just an image of a holographic projection, then why is it that this same UFO that just \"took off' the ground by retracting what seemed to be landing gear and left seeming physical imprints and caused a seeming roar of wind that shook the trees, did all these other things? This, of course, is just the perfection of the deception and nothing would convince Vallee that he had seen a \"real\" spacecraft. Just better and better deception. One wonders how a real spacecraft could be detected in this framework of reasoning. Vallee complains that the star map that Betty Hill saw wasn't to the proper scale. Many of our maps are not to scale for very many cartographic reasons. Who is to say that the only parameter of size for stars on a chart is stellar absolute brightness? There are many possible parameters including population or even trading volume. Distance between Zeta one and two isn't to scale. That fact is hardly unreasonable if it is their home star system. If this mysterious occult group on earth was going to fake a star chart, then why did they make all these mistakes? Perhaps because the star chart was not designed for terrestrial senses and sensibilities but was what it seemed — an alien star chart. The Stellarium that Travis Walton saw was certainly a fake from Vallee's point of view also, regardless of its technical perfection; only in this case he might say its very perfection argued against its being a \"real\" star chart. We can't seem to win. One of Vallee's main arguments against the extraterrestrial hypothesis is that the observed behavior of humanoids isn't what he thinks interstellar visitors would be doing. Again, gross assumptive liberties are taken. Perhaps he has forgotten what several of our own astronauts did on the moon. They came a quarter million miles after oceans of money had been spent to get them there and then they . played golf! They frolicked like children on the surface while collecting samples. Who is to say star travelers must be of sober mien? A lunar Vallee would reject the Apollo astronauts' behavior as not appropriate. An analysis of the humanoid cases indicates a multitude of possible reasons for coming here. We shouldn't second guess Galactic citizens until we know more. We must begin examining the data on an empirical basis. The data persists and repeats, and it is time we began (continued on next pagej 17"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"(Book Review, Continued) accepting the data and not the other way around. We must begin to employ the same analytical process that is employed by intelligence agencies to estimate foreign military and technological activity. The humanoid data is very diverse suggesting multiple star systems as a visitation source. If it is possible to star travel at all, then it is obvious the entire galaxy could be colonized in an eyeblink as stellar events go. We seem to be seeing the edge of a vast and extremely complex galactic society. Why would this mysterious occult group fake (his? That question is never satisfactorily answered. Why bother? This occult group in Vallee's terms is in control of things, we cannot interfere with it, and it is immune from human current understanding. Why can't this group let themselves be seen as interdimensional, time travelers, or even flying carpets? Why space? It seems a pointless hoax. Perhaps it is pointless until we begin to examine this mysterious Mr. Major who seems to have had a major influence on the direction of Vallee's thinking. An investigation into who this \"Major\" is might yield many answers to these questions. If the spacecraft hardware that Mr. Leonard Stringfield has so strongly provided evidence for recently exists in a subterranean vault at Wright- Patterson Airfield, then those spacecraft are like a ticking timebomb in the face of the purveyors of planetary paranoia.--Vincent R.

SEGUIN,TX 78155 MOWING WORLD-HERAID, Onaha, NE - Aug. 22, 1979 Pair Encounter Skeptics After Sighting of UFO By David Heridee WorW-Htretd Staff Wrtltr McCook High School senior John Banels and Curtis farmer Jim Tiller do not consider themselves crackpots. Earlier this week, however, they had a close encounter with that label after a close encounter of a different kind — Banels and Tiller said they saw an unidentified flying-object that was close enough to be hit with a tossed rock. They said the sighting was Wednesday along the western outskirts of McCook on U.S. 83. It was the latest of several re- ports of unidentified flying object sightings in the southwest Nebraska-northwest Kansas region since Aug. 2. Banels. 17. said he and his cousin Tiller. 23, were driving (arm trucks loaded with corn to McCook from Tiller's farm when they both saw a saucer-shaped object about 3'$ feet in diameter wobble across the highway west to east in front of their trucks. The object was about 30 feet in the air and was moving about 5 to 10 mph when Tiller's truck passed by it. Banels, who was following in another truck, said the object had cross- ed the highway and was over the roadside ditch when he saw it. Both said the object resembled two saucer-type snow sleds attached at their rims and ringed with what looked like dozens of blue light bulbs. The flying saucer had a blue top and shiny, silver bottom. \"It was the perfect storybook flying saucer but it didn't appear to have any doors,\" Tiller said. \"It was unbelievable and it wasn't a toy. Wecouldn't figure how it was moving.\" Banels said it wasn't until both men stopped in town and told each other what they had seen did they realize what they had seen. \"We called the McCook radio station and the guy there asked me if we were on any medication, i should have hung up on him, but I wanted to tell someone what we had seen.\" Banels said. \"Now that I've seen one, I kind of believe in them, I think.\" (Director's Message, Continued) national Director of the Mutual UFO Network, Inc. (MUFON), has been invited to speak and has titled his slide illustrated lecture \"A New Look at the Entity Evidence.\" The symposium will be held at the Royal Quality Inn, 4875 - North Harbor Drive, San Diego, CA 92106, beginning Friday evening, November 16, 1979, with a \"get- acquainted\" party. On Saturday, November 17th, the various papers will be delivered, followed by a roundtable discussion between the speakers and a question and answer period afterward. On Saturday evening there will be a no- host cocktail party and banquet with a principal speaker to be announced. The entire symposium is available for $149.50 per couple which includes three days and two nights at the hotel, the Friday evening gathering, all of the Saturday presentations, and the Saturday night cocktail party and banquet. Orders should be placed directly with the hotel by credit card via toll-free telephone (800) 854-2933. The toll-free number for California residents is (800) 532-3733. Those wishing not to use a credit card can make reservations by mail directly to the hotel, but a check in full must accompany the request. The hotel will send a confirmation by return mail. Hal Starr has promised that startling pictures, exciting tape recordings, puzzling artifacts, and serious scientific presentations will mark this as the best effort yet in probing the puzzle of the age — the UFO. We would like to take this opportunity to announce a new journal, \"The Journal of UFO Studies,\" published by the Center for UFO Studies. It is a refereed scientific journal incorporating the most recent work of the professional scientists working on the UFO problem. The editor is Dr. Elaine M. Hendry and the editorial advisor is Dr. J. Allen Hynek. The cost is $3.50 per issue; order from THE JOURNAL OF UFO STUDIES, c/o The Center for UFO Studies, 1609 Sherman Ave. Suite 207, Evanston, IL 60201. (We have not reviewed the first issue due to lack of availability.) The acronym MUFON was adopted from the original name of our organization, when it was known as the Midwest UFO Network. Our worldwide coverage soon made this name obsolete. Since the acronym MUFON was so well known, the word \"mutual\" was substituted for the \"M\". This best described the organizational structure and the mode of operation of people working together on a worldwide scope to resolve the UFO phenomenon. There are no plans to change the name of MUFON, however a modern word and its derivatives exemplifies our goals and objectives. (1) Synergetic: to work with, cooperate, (2) Synergic: working together, cooperating; (3) Synergy: working together; and (4) Synergism: Cooperative action of discrete agencies such that the total effect is greater than the sum of the effects taken independently. 18"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"Lucius Parish In Others' Words The June 26 issue of NATIONAL ENQUIRER reports on reactions to a previous article about \"Star People,\" who claim to be descendants of extraterrestrial beings. A British abduction case is detailed in the July 3 ENQUIRER issue. April sightings of UFOs over Memphis, Tennessee, are reported in the July 10 issue. The July 17 issue quotes Soviet researchers as saying that a crippled alien spacecraft has been in orbit around Earth since 1955. Details of spectacular UFO sightings in the Canary Islands are given in the July 24 issue. A Brazilian UFO encounter involving E-M effects and paralysis is the subject of a feature in the July 31 issue. The August 7 issue contains excerpts from Clive Harold's new paperback THE UNINVITED (published in England), highlighting a family's mysterious experiences with UFOs in Wales. Hypnotic regression sessions conducted by Dr. James Harder have resulted in a woman's claim that she met aliens at three different times and was cured of kidney failure by their treatments, according to a story in the August 14 issue. A U.S. Navy poster urging American and Canadian seamen to report all UFO sightings is the subject of a feature in the issue of August 21. THE STAR for July 3 reports on a UFO sighting in Bogota, Colombia, while the 1979 World UFO Congress was taking place. The August issue of FATE has an interesting article by Gary S. Mangiacopra and Carl J. Pabst on the 1931 sightings of a mystery \"airship\" over towns in the Ohio River Valley. I regret to report that the August issue of OMNI marks the return of James E. Oberg as the \"UFO Update\" columnist. OMNI should at least alternate Oberg's contributions with columns by other writers/researchers. The September issue of UFO REPORT contains articles by Wayne Laporte, Rene Noorbergen, Robert L. Williams and others, including an excerpt from Raymond Fowler's book, THE ANDREASSON AFFAIR. UFO TERMS by Robert S. Somerville is, as the title implies, a glossary of the terminology peculiar to UFO research. It obviously reporesents an enormous amount of research on the part of the author, who has been studying the UFO subject since 1950. The book contains 1,470 entries which are divided into 20 main sections. Some of the section titles are: Basic Terminology — UFO Investigations — United States Air Force — Global UFO Investigations — Radar Detection of UFOs — UFO Movies and Photographs — Effects From UFOs — Animals and UFOs — Physical Traces — Occupants — Bibliography. The book has 275 spot illustrations and includes information on UFO organizations, publications, etc. It is very attractively presented in a large, soft-cover format, containing 198 pages. The book is intended for members of the general public who want a basic understanding of the UFO subject, but Ufologjsts will also find it quite helpful and interesting.

Mr. Thierry's research will be followed by GEPAN, a department of the French National Space Study Center. Upcoming UFO Conferences around the world of interest to JOURNAL readers consist of the following. Rocky Wood, President of ECRA (Earth Colonisation Research Association) has announced preliminary details of their 3rd Annual Seminar in the Concert Chamber of the Wellington Town Hall in Wellington, New Zealand on Saturday, October 27, 1979. Speakers will include Dr. Jan Feike de Bock, ECRA's Director of UFO Investigations, \"The Kaikoura UFO Controversy\" (the New Zealand motion picture film); \"A Review of the 6th World Conference of the Ancient Astronaut Society and a Preview of the Auckland World Conference in 1980\" (illustrated with slides). They hope to show the full Kaikoura UFO film taken by David Crockett, that was recently shown at the 1979 MUFON UFO Symposium in San Francisco by Dr. Bruce S. Maccabee, assisted by David Crockett and Rocky Wood from New Zealand. Mr. Wood reported on the 10th Annual Mutual UFO Network Symposium in the August 1979 issue of their publication, \"Earth Colonisation Report.\" ECRA is a non-profit making organization studying Earth Coloni- sation, Ancient Astronauts and UFO phenomena. Harold H. Fulton, MUFON Director for New Zealand, is their UFO consultant. President, General Alfredo Moacyr de Mendonca Ychoa, has announced the convocation of the First International Congress of Ufology to be held in Brasilia, Federal District, Brazil, from October 26 to 30,1979, sponsored by the National Center for Ufologic Studies (CENEU) (Centra Nacional de Estudos Ufologicos). The First International Congress of Ufology aims at a gathering of Brazilian and foreign researchers of every possible level, with or without official credentials, who are deeply interested in UFOs, the greatest challenge to the human mind at the end of this century. Top authorities will be gathering in San Diego, Calif., for \"UFO 79,\" a scientific examination of the enigma of our age, the unidentified flying object, often called the \"flying saucer,\" according to Hal Starr who is acting as Chairman of the event. Starr, an investigative reporter from Phoenix, Ariz., writes and narrates a daily radio, program, \"UFO REPORT,\" syndicated by a Hollywood firm in seven English speaking countries. He has been working for several months putting together one of the most prestigious groups of scientists ever assembled for such an event.
