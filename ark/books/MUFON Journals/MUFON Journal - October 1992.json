I n the cold winter nights of December 1991 to January 1992, something was haunting Oklahoma, Kansas and Missouri, leaving dead and mutilated cattle in its wake. One couple, driving down a country lane after dark, saw two bright objects moving low in the sky. \"As one got over the road above us, it blinked out,\" said Mike Markum of Cement, Oklahoma. \"The other object stopped and started. That's what caught my attention. We heard no sound.\" Markum and his wife report they have seen several \"sparkler-like balls\" going over their house at low altitudes. One shot off at tremendous speed and left a green trail. By the end of January, five Oklahoma Counties (Grant, Blaine, Garfield, Kingfisher, and Commanche), Sumner County in Kansas and Webster County in Missouri had about 30 reports of mysteriously killed and mutilated animals. Even though the socially acceptable explanations in those coun- ties are either Satanic cults or predators, Sheriff Archie Yearick of Grant County told me that he was puzzled \"because there aren't any tracks around any of these car- casses.\" That same comment has been made by law enforcement and ranchers since the animal mutilation mystery began in September 1967, when a horse named Lady was found in the San Luis Valley of Colorado stripped of flesh from the neck up. Lady's hoof tracks stopped 100 feet from where her body was found. Residents had seen odd lights and \"small jets\" moving low and rapidly over the desert. Worldwide news articles quoted speculations that UFOs and the mare's strange death were connected. When I began research for my documentary \"A Strange Harvest\" in 1979,1 did not set out to do a film about an alien life form connection. But that's what I found in several eyewitness accounts of orange, silent, glowing objects the size of football fields hovering above pastures where mutilated animals were later found. Or beams of light observed shin- ing down from \"silent helicopters\" that lighted pastures \"brighter than daylight\" and the next day muti- lated animals were found. And eyewitness reports of strange craft and/or nonhuman creatures in- volved with animals. Linda Moulton Howe, a TV producer and writer, is MUFON's Media Adviser. Her works include \"A Strange Harvest,\" an Emmy Award-winning documentary about the animal mutilation mystery (CBS, © 1980); \"An Alien Harvest-Further Evidence Linking Animal Mutilations and Human Abductions to Alien Life Forms\" (© 1989); \"Earth Mysteries: Alien Life Forms,\" a 2-hour TV special (Fox, © 1990); \"UFO Report: Sightings (Fox, © 1991); and \"The UFO Jigsaw\" (©1992). In 1983, a Missouri couple watched through binoculars as two small beings in tight-fitting silver suits \"floated a paralyzed black cow into a craft.\" The alien heads were large and white-colored. Nearby, a tall, green-skinned \"lizard man\" stood glaring with eyes slit by vertical pupils like a crocodile's. In 1980, a Waco, Texas rancher watched one evening as two, four-foot tall creatures with large, slanted, black eyes carried a calf between them. He was terrified and ran away. Three days later he had the courage to go back to the scene with his wife and son. There they found the mutilated calf s body. The hide was completely intact and included the hooves and the skull bone, but no other skeletal structure or muscles or internal organs. The hide was turned inside out and folded neatly on the ground next to the backbone from which all the ribs had been removed. That rancher asked me, \"Who would do this — and what are they trying to tell us?\" S ince I began research into the animal mystery in 1979, no year has passed without mutilation reports and 1992 was no exception. On January 25, 1992 near Okemah, Oklahoma, a cow was found dead. The udder had been cut bloodlessly from the animal and was found lying on the ground. The right chest was slit and an Okfuskee County Sheriff Deputy assumed the heart had been removed. But no veterinarian was asked to do a necropsy. Without any hard evidence, the deputy's report simply said: \"Motive: Satanic Ritual.\" But even he was surprised about how precisely the cuts had been made without any blood residue. On Saturday, February 2, 1992 MUFON Oklahoma investigator Chuck Pine travelled to Garfield, Kingfisher and Grant County Sheriffs offices to help me get more details about the January mutilations. Grant County Sheriff Archie Yearick said that, that morning he had received a call from the police in Caldwell, Kansas about a fresh steer mutilation there. So, Chuck proceeded north over the border and travelled with a police officer to the mutilation site. Chuck retrieved tissue samples from the mutilator's cuts as well as unaffected tissue for contrast, preserved them in formalin solution and sent them Federal Express to Dr. John Altshuler, pathologist and hematologist in Denver, Colorado. Dr. Altshuler and I have been working together since 1989 in an effort to gather as many animal mutilation tissue samples as possible for microscopic examination. So far, the microscope has shown that tissue from animals (including rabbits, deer, horses and cattle) have been cut with high heat in the hun- dreds of degrees, as evidenced in the cooked hemoglobin and other cell changes. In one 1990 Oregon case, the tissue was serrated as if cut by MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 294 October 1992"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"pinking shears. Both Dr. Altshuler and the Oregon State Diagnostic Laboratory confirmed high heat had been used at the excision lines. Dr. Altshuler found the same heat- induced cell changes in the February 1, 1992 Caldwell, Kansas steer. The following Tuesday, February 11, 1992, there were two more reports of cattle mutilations at Calumet, Oklaho- ma, 10 miles west of El Reno. The first was found by Robert Jacobs and his son Travis Dean on the morning of February 6th. Half of the Brahma steer's tongue was removed; a bloodless, oval incision had removed the genitals and the rec- tum was cored out. No blood, no tracks. T hat evening, Travis took his girl- friend, Julie Hamilton, back to the field to show her what had happened. It was about 8:15 p.m. when they \"saw a light above our field. It was about 10 times brighter than a star. As we drove closer, we began to see dif- ferent colored lights on the edge. They were red, yellow, blue and white. They flashed at random, not sequentially.\" When they got to within three- quarters of a mile from the object, Julie became frightened and they returned to town. The object rose higher in the sky and followed them. \"We were doing about 80 and by the time we reached town, it had gone past us.\" After dropping Julie off at her house, Travis picked up his father and went back to the field where they saw the light again over the pasture. Robert Jacobs said he could clearly see the different colors flashing on the object. They tried to ap- proach it in the pick-up, but the light moved away and disappeared. In a few minutes, the light reappeared, moving to the southeast and disappeared again. Photos, top to bottom: Mutilated steer, Caldwell, Kansas, photo- graphed by Chuck Pine on Feb. 3, 1992.

Like the February 6th Brahma steer, the front half of the tongue had been removed; the left ear had been removed as if with high heat (see unidentified black, bubbly residue in bottom photo, this page); a neat excision had removed the genitals; and the rectum was cored out. On March 3, back in Okemah, Oklahoma after midnight, three men saw a grey, diamond-shaped object with \"windows\" land and then take off. They estimated the diameter to be over 30 feet. A week later on March 9, a cow was found with its udder cleanly and bloodlessly excised from the belly. There was also a large hole on the cow's left side. \"Like a bullet hole,\" some said, but there was no exit hole and no bullet. There was also blood on the ground near the cow's head which is not typical. The next day on March 4, Benton County Sheriff Deputy Danny Varner went to meet Bill Cowger at Tyson's Hog Farms near Hiwasse, Arkansas. An eight-year-old cow was lying on her right side. Her left eye was miss- ing, the tongue had been removed, and a large piece of hide measuring 20 by 30 inches had been removed between the cow's back legs, taking the udder with it. The cut was only hide deep. The muscle tissue underneath was untouched. Sgt. Varner wrote in his investigation report: 1 found the cow's tongue had *Any of a breed of cattle developed in Hereford- shire, England, having a reddish coat with white markings.

The tongue was cut diagonally from side to side, ap- proximately six to eight inches from the cow's front teeth. The cow's left eye had been removed. The cow's udder and hide were removed by a very sharp in- strument, no damage was done to the stomach wall and the cuts looked to be that of a surgeon. The cow's vaginal area looked to be enlarged and pulled outwards. The ground surrounding the cow had no indications (she) had struggled and 1 was unable to find any footprints around the cow. A small amount of blood was found on and around the cow. On Monday, March 9, 1992 I con- tacted Dr. Marion Harris, a veteri- narian from Gravette, Arkansas. I asked Dr. Harris if a cow's internal organs could be removed by entering the cow's vagina. Dr. Harris stated that organs could be removed through the vaginal tract if the cow had recently had a calf and the person knew what they were doing. According to Mr. Cowger, the cow had a calf about six weeks prior to her death. I asked Dr. Harris if he would do an autospy on the cow and he stated he would. On Thursday, March 12, 1992 at 2 p.m., I, Del. Sgt. Sam Blankenship and Bill Cowger met Dr. Harris at the pro- perty where the cow was found. Dr. Harris was unable to determine if any organs (were) missing because of wait- ing eight days before an autopsy was attempted. F ebruary to March 1992 also in- cluded reports of 11 mutilated cows in Webster County, Missouri east of Springfield. Photos, top to bottom: Same steer. Rectum cored out. Photo by Chuck Pine.

At the same time, people were see- ing strange lights in the sky over North- view. The Highway Patrol said so many people were parking along the 1-44 Northview exit to look for UFOs that it was a safety hazard. Tissue from nine of the mutilations was sent to Dr. Altshuler who found evidence of high heat at the excision lines and a hardened \"plasticized\" edge which is not consistent with typical lasers. Even a portable laser is the size of a large freezer and requires a large electrical generator. \"If you could afford one, why would you lug it out to a field in the middle of the night where a farmer might take a shot at you for messing with his cows? Why not just buy your own cow?\" Duane Bedell asked. He is Co-State Section Director of the MUFON chapter in Webster County. \"And how are the cows killed without a struggle, no tracks and no blood?\" One farmer, Joe Bouldin, said his cow's throat was slit, the esophagus was removed and the teats were sliced off the udder. \"But there were no marks on the ground anywhere. It's real mysterious,\" Bouldin said. A necropsy revealed most of the blood had been drained from the cow. But the ground was dry. \"How do you drain a cow of blood without spilling any?\" Bouldin asked. \"I've never carried a gun before in my life,\" Bouldin added, \"but now we are carrying a loaded gun in our truck. That's about how I feel about all this.\" Another troubled farmer was Ed- wina Ragsdale. She said, \"It's just like the cows were embalmed. We went out there last week (February 1992) and there was a faint smell of decay, but they should have been deteriorated by now.\" When asked what she thought was responsible, she said, \"UFOs or cults, they both scare me to death.\" I have also seen an \"embalmed\" animal. In May 1980, when I was pro- ducing the documentary \"A Strange Harvest,\" a rancher east of Colorado Springs found one of his horses dead and mutilated. As often happens, mutilations aren't reported for several days. In this case, the crew and I filmed about 20 days after the horse was first found dead. The weather had been warm, but still there were no mag- gots. Another week later, after the horse had been dead for a month, mag- gots emerged. But when we cut into the horse's flanks to take tissue sam- ples, the muscle was bright red. I asked a local veterinarian if that was normal. He said it was not, that there should have been decayed tissue. MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 294 October 1992"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"B y April 1992, mutilations were reported in Liberty, Mississippi and Leduc, Alberta, Canada. In Liberty, two cows had been found with half their face hide removed and the tongues cut out. Then a three-day-old calf was found with its head and hind feet missing, all bloodless and trackless. That month in Canada, ranchers Dorthea and Roman Ver- chomin discovered the first of six mutilated cows found be- tween April 14 and July 16, 1992. They are certain predators are not to blame. The first was a 20-year-old Holstein milk cow that Mrs. Verchomin had raised and kept to provide extra milk during the calving season. She was a quiet, docile cow and Mrs. Verchomin said she does not understand what could have separated her from the herd. The cow hadn't been dead more than six hours when she was found. In the left shoulder was a hole like a \"bullet hole\" that angled down into the chest, similar to the cow in Okemah, Oklahoma. Like the Okemah case, no bullet was recovered and there was no exit-wound. On the cow's throat was a 12-inch vertical cut just beside the jugular vein. There was also a round cut around the rectum, approximately two inches deep into the hide, right through\" the hair, and the anus and vagina had been cut out. \"Most notable was the absence of blood in and around the body,\" wrote MUFON investigator Janice Semeniuk, working with Gordon Kijek, Director of the Alberta UFO Study Group. Mr. and Mrs. Verchomin called veterinarian Dr. Wayne Sereda and when he opened the cow on site, \"the flesh was unusually white,\" indicating thorough removal of blood. Mrs. Verchomin said the vet and Royal Canadian Mounted Police investigator, Cst. Coloumbe, discussed how \"they\" could drain so much blood out of the animal. Yet the two investigators maintained that predators were responsible for the kill. That conclusion upset Mrs. Verchomin. \"I have never seen cuts like those on that cow. I followed the cuts with my finger. They were harder than the hide and every two inches there was a slight rise like a scalloped edge,\" she said. \"The rest of the cows became very upset when they found her. Their eyes rolled around and they bellowed and stampeded.\" Mrs. Verchomin is convinced after years of farming that no predator could cut a cow that way. \"Coyotes don't even come onto our property,\" she said, \"and they haven't bothered the herd in the past.\" Speculation about Satanic cult activity raised the possibility that someone arrived quietly, perhaps by canoe, from the shore of Saunders Lake which runs alongside the property. Yet, there were no clues as to how the blood was drained from the cow without leaving a trace or tracks. Mrs. Verchomin remembered that she had let her dogs out the evening before and was waked around 1:45 a.m. by their barking. She realized she had not shut down the pump house. So she took a flashlight out into the yard. \"It was unusually quiet, even for the country,\" she said. \"There was no noise whatsoever.\" But she saw nothing unusual until the next morning when she found her mutilated milk cow. Then between June 14 and July 16, 1992, Dorthea and Roman Verchomin found five more dead cattle on their Leduc, Alberta, Canada farm. All six of the cows were found lying on their right side. The chronological list is: 1) April 14, 1992 20-year-old Holstein milk cow 2) June 14, 1992 250-pound Charolais Hereford calf 3) June 21, 1992 250-pound Hereford heifer calf 4) June 24, 1992 250-pound Hereford heifer calf 5) June 28, 1992 800-pound Hereford milk cow 6) July 16, 1992 800-pound Hereford milk cow M rs. Vermochin estimates the June 14 calf was found about two days after death. It was in a twisted posi- tion with the right side of the head and chest lying on the ground with front legs straight to the left, while the back half was flat to the ground with the hind legs spread apart. The left ear and eye were gone. A hole in the left side of the neck angled down into the chest. The tail was removed up to the tail bone. The rectum and vulva were cored out, along with a large, oval-shaped piece of hide that extended from the rectum up between the back legs, along the belly to three ribs up onto the chest. All the internal organs had been cleanly removed and the internal cavity was dry and blackened in color. Again, Dr. Sereda was called to examine the animal. This time he brought a veterinarian colleague along and stated that because the calf was decomposing he could not make a positive determination of cause of death. An RCMP in- vestigator was also there, but neither photographs nor tissue samples were taken. The June 21 calf was still warm when found dead near its mother's feet. The cow was standing guard over the body a full mile from the rest of the herd. Mrs. Verchomin took the carcass to the Provincial Lab veterinarian who said \"there is no such thing as cattle mutilations\" and promptly deter- mined that the calf died \"due to overwhelming bacterial in- fection,\" specifically Clostridium bacteria. There were no excisions. Three days later on June 24, \"we smelled another dead animal,\" said Mrs. Verchomin, and they discovered another 250-pound calf decaying 60 yards from where yet an even bigger Hereford would be found on June 28. That 800-pound Hereford milk cow found on the 28th had an ear and eye missing, the tail was removed to the tail bone, the rectum and vagina had been cored out and the udder had been excised in a \"perfect, round circle only hide deep leaving the membrane tissue covering the muscles completely untouched.\" Mrs. Verchomin said the pristine nature of the cuts on the perfectly preserved body astonished her. Cst. Coulombe of the RCMP Leduc Detachment arrived to check the cow, but no vet was called because \"the body was already MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 294 October 1992"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"two or three days dead.\" There were no signs of predators. \"In fact, the animal layed there for a full week and not even the coyotes touched it. Not one bite! Finally, it decomposed by itself,\" said Mrs. Verchomin. On July 16, a two-year-old Hereford milk cow was found with the rectum cored out and one teat cleanly removed from the udder as if \"burned off.\" Part of the tongue and several teeth were gone. On the left side of its neck was a four-inch slit with a one-inch-wide and two-inch-deep hole in the mid- dle of it. Tissue samples were taken from the outer region of the rectum and vulva, and forwarded to Dr. Altshuler. He found the excision lines to be darkened and plasticized; under the microscope the cells revealed exposure to high heat. M utilation reports are not confined to cattle. They have included most domestic animals, including house cats. Since the 1970s, there have been waves of cat mutila- tions in Canada, California, Texas and again in 1992. From May 15 on, cats were found dead and mutilated in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. Typical was the purebred Rus- sian blue cat that was put out in the evening and never came back. The back half of the cat was found three blocks from its owner's home without a trace of blood. It was the fourth cat found cut in half in a two week period. In the summer of 1991 in Piano, Texas, an upper middle class community north of Dallas, the police department had nearly 100 reports of missing domestic cats along with several mutilated ones. After my book, An Alien Harvest** was released in June 1989 about animal mutliations, human abductions and government knowledge, I received a letter from a security guard in Denver, Colorado. He described a night in August when he was patrolling the grounds of a large corporation west of the city. From his truck, he could see a large circle of lights in the dark sky. The lights remained stationary over a pasture a few hundred feet from where the guard watched. He never phoned anyone because he was afraid if he uttered the word \"UFO\" he might lose his job. But the next morning, he felt guilty as he watched a farmer gather up two dead and mutilated cows from the pasture where the lights had hovered overhead. He asked me, \"What kind of technology are we talking about? I never took my eyes off those lights. There was no beam, no sound, nothing. How did they do it?\" If alien life forms have been involved with nearly three decades of worldwide animal mutilations and disap- pearances, what is it the aliens need? In 1980, Myrna Hansen and her young son saw two white- suited beings working on a cow near Cimarron, New Mex- ico. The cow was bellowing in pain, and Myrna tried to in- terfere. The result was that both she and her son were ab- ducted by large, brightly-lighted disks which took them to **An Alien Harvest - Further Evidence Linking Animal Mutilations and Human Abductions to Alien Life Forms, ©1989 by Linda Moulton Howe. an underground facility which she thought was in the Las Cruces region. There Myrna saw a humanoid figure floating in a vat of reddish liquid which she perceived to be a \"treat- ment\" or sustenance of some kind for the immersed being. She also thought the liquid was related to blood fluids and tissues removed from animals. A decade earlier in 1973, Judy Doraty watched a brown and white calf rise in a pale beam of yellow light. Inside a small, round, white room, she saw tissue excised from the calf s eye, tongue and testicles by two, small, grey- skinned creatures with large eyes. They had four fingers, instead of five, and those long, thin fingers tapered to dark nails. Their eyes were not solid black, but were yellow with a black vertical pupil like a cat's or a snake's. Judy's daughter, Cindy, was also abducted at the same time, and in a 1990 hypnosis session with psychiatric hypno-therapist John Carpenter in Springfield, Missouri, also reported seeing a calf rising in a beam of light. Judy had the clear impres- sion that what the alien beings were doing with the calf had to do with survival — theirs and ours. In both the Cindy Doraty and Myrna Hansen cases, the women were examined by the beings. Eggs were removed in a painful procedure from Myrna's ovaries. In some cases, men and women have been shown \"baby things\" which they are told are hybrids, part human and part something else. If genetic material is what the alien intelligence wants, why does it need so much over so many years? And why does it leave animals to be found with strange, bloodless excisions that provoke fear and anger? To report or obtain further information, please contact: Linda Moulton Howe P.O.

Witneses I met Mrs. R.W. in Denver at a UFO conference (May 24, 1992) when she rather casually told me the following details of her sighting. She did not seek me out; I met her because she had participated as a conference organizer. I was impressed with her obvious intelligence and technical capabilities. She received a Master's degree in Computer Science and had worked at Bell Labs from 1979 to 1987 as a software programmer. Her husband also has a Master's degree in Biometry, which is a new synthesis of forestry and statistics. Neither had seen a UFO before. I was also impressed with Mrs. R.W.'s apparent honesty and the forth- right manner in which she recounted her experiences which took place some seven years earlier. Details of the Sighting Event The following narrative (within quotations) is taken direct- ly from a two-page summary prepared on May 23, 1992 by Mrs. R.W. (age 28) \"It was approximately 11:30 p.m. on a Saturday evening. My husband and I had taken my friend, Lisa, out to dinner in Denver. Neither my husband nor myself had consumed any alcohol or drugs; Lisa had a small amount of wine with dinner. We were dropping her off at her car, which was parked in the parking lot of Bell Laboratories at 120th and Pecos Streets in Denver, Colorado. Lisa and I were both computer software engineers for many years at this Bell Laboratories facility. Figure 1 is an ap- proximate drawing showing the path of travel of the three witnesses as they approached the AT&T property (see cover). Position 1 was approximately where Mrs. R.W. first saw the strange formation of lights on Pecos Street. A is where they stopped their two-door car to let Lisa out. (1) \"The Bell Labs facility is co-hosted with Western Elec- tric in a very large, flat-topped building at this site, approx- imately 120 acres on the main level. The building is situated on a slight hill. As our car approached the building (Posi- tion 2), I noticed that there were red and white lights shin- ing down on the roof of the building. I began to try to figure out what they were — perhaps the maintenance department was working on the roof-mounted air conditioning units over the weekend.

At this point, we were quite close to the bottom of the UFO, about 20 or 30 yards away. (3) The lights appeared in an oval for- mation, about 30 feet long and 20 feet wide. They appeared to be attached to the undersurface of a dark oval-shaped ob- ject. I tried to see the upper contours of the object, but because of the brightness of the lights, I could not. \"The only thing my rational mind could conceive that this might be at this point was a very large helicopter. I reasoned that the Air Force Academy at Colorado Springs, about 60 miles away, was training cadets in reconnaissance work, showing them how to view objects through the roof of the building. But there was absolutely no motion or vibration apparent in the lights. My husband rolled down his win- dow, and I opened the car door to let Lisa out of the car. There was no engine roar or rotor blade sound coming from the 'helicopter' \"! T here was a slight hum, which may have come from the parking lot lights, or may have emanated from the craft.

The photograph also shows the relative locations of Mr. and Mrs. R.W.'s car at \"A\" and Lisa's at \"B\" (portrayed on cover). There were no other cars present at the time in the parking lot. On a second drawing made by her in May 1992, she gave the diameter of the oval of eleven, round colored lights as 30 feet wide by 20 feet high. This size estimate is quite close to the above calculated object diameter as scaled from the photograph. Each individual (pure) red and white light was not as large in angle as her thumbnail viewed at arm's length; each is therefore estimated to subtend an angle of about 1.5 degrees arc. \"At this point, my engineer's mind was racing trying to determine what this thing was. \"When we slammed the car door shut, an amazing thing happened. The UFO moved suddenly and silently, straight up in the air, about 50 feet, and stopped. There seemed to be no acceleration phase or deceleration phase in its move- ment, even though it traversed the short distance at a very high rate of speed. \"We were going to chase this thing,\" she said during our site visit. \"My husband and I took off around the drive (see arrows at point 4 through 7 on cover) and out onto Pecos Street at a high rate of speed. We turned right onto 120th Avenue and then onto Interstate 25 heading north. We got up to 80 mph at one point, but it was out of sight by then. I don't remember much after that... It seemed to be travelling horizontally and smoothly.\" (4) Sighting Locale The observation site was at 1200 North Pecos Street, just north of the small town of Northglenn, Colorado (23.75 miles due north of downtown metropolitan Denver and just west of Interstate highway 25 leading to Cheyenne, Wyoming, to the north). The site also lies 12.5 miles NW of the NW edge of the highly restricted Rocky Mountain Arsenal at which triggers for nuclear bombs were assembled for many years. The work there was top secret, and the air space above it was restricted at the time. Stapleton International Airport lies due south of the arsenal several miles farther. Lowry Air Force Base lies several more miles south of the airport. The terrain in the immediate area is characterized by gent- ly rolling hills with an elevation difference of about + / — 50 feet. Discussion The primary witness typed a two-page summary of her experience upon request and wrote, \"Strangely enough, we (my husband and I) never discussed this event for four years. It just never seemed to enter our minds as a topic of con- versation. It wasn't that we were embarrassed or afraid to Figure 2: AT&T Lab from witnesses' point of view. discuss it with each other. We just didn't consciously remember it ... One summer day four years after the sighting, I was having dinner by myself in a Boulder Restaurant. On the cover of the local newspaper 1 was reading, there was an article about a UFO researcher (whose name eludes me now) who lives in Boulder (5). Suddenly, in the middle of the article, the memory of our UFO sighting came flooding back to me. I immediately drove to the home of this researcher to tell him my story ... When I returned home and told my husband of my memory, he, too, remembered the same events.\" She told me that at no time during the event did she feel fearful, but that she was very excited four years later when she read the article. Some Questions This narrative raises some challenging and interesting questions. First, why did the amnesia occur at all? There was no obvious trauma and little to suggest an abduction event which might result in memory loss. Second, as is so typical with others having this kind of experience, why didn't they remember this event the following day or days? What is implied is that the encounter actually involved far more than was recalled either four years later or very recently. Third, is everyone's amnesia linked or are there different mechanisms involved? Fourth, why did Mrs. R.W. have to read half way through the article by Dr. Sigismund before triggering the recall? If artificially induced, was the amnesia implanted so deeply that it takes a long period of exposure to trigger words or concepts to release it? Why didn't Lisa remember anything about the event after- ward? Is it possible that the three witnesses experienced missing time and possibly more? There is no way to know for sure.

Stringfield Author Stringfield continues his investigations into cases involving retrieved UFOs and aliens. H opefully we are a step closer to breaching the pro- verbial wall of secrecy by releasing this story, which chronicles an alleged major event that may repre- sent a rewarding breakthrough for mankind's right-to-know. Although details at this time are scant, the two sources responsible for the story are credibly recognized in scien- tific circles. One, who is acting as intermediary for the prime source, a longtime friend and colleague, is a professor of physics at a major Midwest university. The prime source is a highly educated individual with a strong scientific background, who must remain anonymous for obvious reasons. He chose to take his friend into his confidence to relate that he had at an unspecified time a one-on-one, face- to-face meeting with a live extraterrestrial entity under pre- arranged conditions. As recorded in my book, The Inner Sanctum, Status Report VI (published September 1991), contact with my source began with the investigation of a UFO crash/retrieval incident, which gave us the opportunity to work closely for many months, build- ing a lasting mutual trust in our research endeavors. This relationship was exemplified in March of 1990, when my friend \"The extraterrestrial was insectoid in appear- ance and stood about four feet tall. It had large, black wrap-around eyes that were both power- ful and riveting.\"  — Anonymous called to alert me that sensitive information would follow by mail. His edited letter stated in part: Dear Len: Here are the details of my friend's experience with a live EBE in the Seventies. I thought it best if I didn 't say anything over the phone about my writing this letter. First of all, I trust this individual about as much as one can trust anyone, to the extent that if he is lying to me, I really don't know who I can believe. He was asked by officials (either government or military, I don't know which) to meet with the extraterrestrial in order to attempt to communicate telepathically with it. I asked him where they keep it, and he gave me a vague answer that did tell me where. He also said that the military had devised some kind of electrostatic barrier for study of the limits of signal ranges at a specified location where dialogue took place. He told me an interesting thing about the crystal com- municator that the EBE had there. He didn't see it himself, but spoke to someone who had seen it. Apparently each event that happens leaves behind some kind of biogravity trace, like the infrared trace we might leave for a few days if we walk across a field. According to information given to my friend, this crystal device distinguishes between bio- magnetic and bio-gravitational signals in the human brain's own crystalline field and can sort out bio-gravity traces from the past and can coordinate traces from specific events and show them in the crystal. Well, Len, that's about it. If you have any questions about any of this, I will be glad to try to answer them. I think I have told you all of the details I know; but if I think of anything else I'll let you know. As we discussed previously, please don't mention these details to anyone. In late 1990 and early 1991, following this disclosure, other credible sources were also sharing bits and pieces of sen- sitive information, some of it dealing with UFO crash/re- trievals, suspected government interaction in abduction cases, a hostile confrontation in a war zone and military air- craft encounters, et cetera. As a result, I wrote The Inner Sanctum, in which I included this terse reference on page 126: \"... two sources tell of scientific and/or military con- tact with a live alien. One, who was more specific, is a physicist, whose friend, also a scientist, was assigned to interrogate a live entity in isolation under rigid control con- ditions. The details entrusted to me are, by request, not publishable at this time.\" Further sensitized by the influx of new information from deep- throat sources, I speculated in the Prologue of my book that some of it may have been initiated from inside the wall of secrecy, either as part of a master plan to spoon- feed the public, or, because of a sudden dire urgency. My friend's source gave no hint as to his role, but I learned later that he evinced some personal concerns. I n January 1992 my friend and his source met again. Because I had received information from firsthand medical sources in the late 1970s about the ET's physiological features, he asked before the meeting that I submit a list of pertinent questions to ask his contact. My friend's letter of January 18, with significant parallelisms, follows, in part: The extraterrestrial was insectoid in appearance, and stood about four feet tall. It has large, black, penetrating, wrap- around eyes that were both powerful and riveting. They seemed to be 30-40 times stronger than ours, so it could see well at night, and in dark environments. Its nose and mouth were insignificant. Its arms were long with respect to its body, and its hands had four fingers, two of which seemed longer than the others. My contact could not deter- mine its sex. It had some kind of head covering on (not a helmet), and also wore clothing; but my contact hardly MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 294 October 1992"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"noticed, since its face was so powerful and riveting. He doesn 't know if it had a beltline system on. It didn 't gesture or move (I think / remember this correctly). My contact did not notice any eye movement or blinking. It was too dark to tell if the skin was reptilian. It was cooperative, not hostile. The room was dimly lit, with modest furniture and a single window. My contact was seated, and it was standing. There was no one else in the room, but my contact thought he was probably being watched, possibly through electronic or paranormal surveillance. My contact would not say how he was brought in, and would not say when their meeting occurred. He would only say that he has been cooperating with the government since 1973. The extraterrestrial was not captured, and there was no intercept mission. Rather, it was part of an exchange pro- gram. My contact would not say when the exchange took place. Their ship (and others) operates out of both east and west coast areas, which accounts for the confusion among UFO researchers. My contact said that we benefited far more from the exchange program (with the higher or ethical ETs) than they did. Dialogue with the ET was normally behind some kind of electrostatic barrier, but the barrier and locks were useless, since it could free itself any time it wanted to. It chose to stay where we wanted it. Their mission here is scientific, not hostile. My contact communicated with it telepathically for roughly 35 minutes about various topics in astronomy and astrophysics. He wouldn 't tell me what they told each other mentally, except that it said that it came from a star system so far away that it wasn 't worth giving the location. It was not from the Zeta Reticuli star system — much farther away. My contact said that there are four different kinds of greys. He had the impression that this one seemed to take energy from the surroundings rather than through eating or absorp- tion by photosynthesis. There are lower (unethical) and higher (ethical) ETs involved with genetic experimentation. We are in trouble because most experts cannot discern the intent of the lower ETs from the higher ETs who respect human freedom. All governments in the world originally kept everything quiet, until they could find out what was going on. Then, as more information was gotten and an agree- ment with the aliens was made, it became harder to release the information. There could be a massive public outcry when this is exposed, forcing resignations on a grand scale — governmental, military, etc. New people will be needed to come forth with new ideas. My contact said that the meeting was a powerful, riveting experience. C omments: Persistent rumors, since the late 1960s tell of ET contact and/or clandestine connection with of- ficialdom. Stories cover a wide spectrum: cooperative treaties for peaceful universal coexistence or, on a grimmer Author and researcher Leonard Stringfield. note, the takeover of underground bases and a broken trea- ty, hostile skirmishes, exchange of abduction rights for technology, animal and human mutilations, ad infinitum. If any of these scenarios are true, except for the Utopian prospects for peaceful universal coexistence, then one need not expect an official admission — especially if a superior race is dictating the terms. According to my friend's source, the ET he met as a representative of one race of greys is here for non-hostile scientific purposes. Why, then, has officialdom not shared this bit of seeming harmony with humanity? Why maximum secrecy? But to appraise or put into perspective the far-reaching implications of an alleged human-extraterrestrial exchange program, we need more definitive and updated information. If, as my source avers, we are visited by more than one ex- traterrestrial race, each possibly with a different agenda, we are left only to ponder the intents of those not agreeing to formal contact or an exchange program. What for example, is the purpose of abductions, a viola- tion of human rights? What, if true, is the meaning behind the claims of genetic manipulation or fetus snatching?

Hyzer (\"The Gulf Breeze Photographs: Bona Fide or Bogus?\") which ap- peared in the July 1992 issue of the MUFON UFO Journal in the following points: 1) Hyzer assumes that photos #35 and up were shot on SX-70 film in a Sun 600 camera. SX-70 film won't fit in the Sun 600 series cameras. 2) Hyzer states that Polacolor film gives a near-doubling of contrast with extended processing to 15 minutes or so. My testing of the 108 film used, as verified by others, shows no such effect. 3) Hyzer claims that under optimal conditions, a 20% con- trast between a model and its background can be obtained using the methods he describes to fake photo #1. However, measurement of the original photo #1 using an X-Rite 418 densitometer, show that the UFO main body in photo #1 is over 50% brighter than the sky, and the brighter \"lower- window\" area, partially blocked by the tree, is over twice as bright as the sky. Therefore, his hypothesis is inapplicable to the photo in question. Grayscale reflectance percentages found on the original photo#l are: Tree   1.2 UFO upper center  4.9 Sky just above UFO  3.1 UFO right-lower-window area  5.8 Sky right of lower-window area 2.8 4) Hyzer's method of \"hiding\" the UFO behind the tree assumes the tree is totally dark. This is not the case in photo #1. The darkest part of photo #1 was measured to be .75% reflectance, in close agreement with Hyzer's data as pub- lished in PHOTOMETHODS. However, the tree-region of interest has a reflectance of 1.2%, either due to its intrinsic brightness or more probably due to glare. This brightness is mostly in the blue, not the unreliable red, so it appears to be valid exposure. E ven assuming Hyzer's published 15-minute film- exposure versus reflectance data are valid, the com- bined exposure of the UFO (.006MCS) plus the tree (also .006MCS) would result in an overlap exposure of 2.4%, only slightly dimmer than the sky brightness of 2.8%. But utter- ly no evidence of this is evident, even if the individual col- ors are scanned. In practice, my reference photographs which succeeded in duplicating the tree, UFO, and sky brightness showed a visible overlap which was readily obvious to eye or machine. References photographed by Maccabee and myself, two to four times darker than photo #1, which the hypothesis would predict would be more successful, never- theless fail simple visual inspection. 5) Hyzer says all of the photographs could be created us- ing the double-exposure methods described, presumably in- cluding photo #37L, which he acknowledges receiving, although he considered it photogrammatically worthless for stereo purposes. Looking at photo #37L as a simple photo rather than part of a stereo pair, his \"hiding\" mechanism is obviously inap- plicable. The mechanism requires a dark tree and, minimally, \"somewhat underexposed\" background. But the sky in photo #37L is totally black, yet the UFO illumination is successful- ly blocked. So Hyzer's claim of universal double-exposures is contradicted by this photo. 6) Hyzer states that there is no pattern of increased pave- ment illumination beneath photo #19's power ring. My work on the original photo shows not only that there is, but that it corresponds to what would be expected in a real setting. Both the pavement edges, and to a lesser extent the centerline, show signs of illumination. Attempts to duplicate these ef- fects using double-exposure techniques have failed. 7) Photo 24 shows evidence of interaction between the beam and the sweater arm, and an anomalous glow atop a PVC pipe in the background, neither of which is explainable by Hyzer's theory. 8) The published reference photograph showing headlight reflections from a Ford 150 XLT truck hood, shows that any UFO or roadspot reflections should be compressed at the extreme front of the hood. Photo #19 shows an inverted reflection of the sky in the hood near the cab, then darkness, then some other reflection near the front. (Figure 3: Lines mark correlated horizon features to their reflections, while an uncorrelated front-hood-reflection is bracketed.) Note that the distant treeline peaks above the UFO, but the corresponding hood-reflection is substantially straighten Assuming the dent is a simple shape, any UFO reflection would therefore be \"pushed\" toward the hood front. Figure 3 shows that the front hood-reflection does not align to the sky, and aligns best to the UFO. Without a better description of the dent, this may or may not be a UFO reflec- tion. It is dim, but this may be due to a dirty front end. A survey of pickup-trucks in my employer's muddy park- ing lot verified that many pickups are dirty near the hood front, and this would not be unusual for the construction vehicle involved. Without more data regarding the hood dent and dirtiness, I cannot say this reflection is not due to the UFO. As Hyzer ignores all witness testimony, the mud fac- tor may not have been considered. Several of these points, and others not covered by Hyzer, are covered in more detail with pictorial evidence, in my article in the MUFON 1992 Symposium Proceedings (\"Photo Analysis: A Pictorial Primer\"), available through MUFON. (Color data, needed to best understand the analysis of photo #24, are available on videotape.)

Since there are differences in the availability of quality input, the usage of witness testimony, and the process- ing methods, my rebuttal of several of his points should not be taken as a rebuttal of his photoanalytic expertise. Jeff Sainio is manager of Imaging Research & Development for the Quad/Tech Division of Quad/Graphics, a Wisconsin state direc- tor and MUFON staff photoanalyst. William G. Hyzer Responds D igital image processing is a highly creative tool, more of an art than a science, which Mr. Sainio has skillfully applied in his efforts to counter any and all arguments by other investigators that in any way ques- tion the authenticity of the Walters' photographs. He ad- ministers the coup de grace early in his \"Photo Analysis: A Pictorial Primer\" (MUFON 1992 Symposium Proceedings, pp. 133-65), with the notion that UFO appearances might \"resemble fakes or misidentifications\" as a means of in- tentionally misleading earthly observers. After encounter- ing this profound statement in the 8th paragraph, I wondered: \"what earthly reason did Mr. Sainio have for continuing his work described on the remaining 39 pages!?\" There is a certain commonality that exists between some statisticians and digital-image-processing aficionados: \"Tell me what you want them to hear and I will produce a statistic to support it.\" \"Explain to me what you want them to see and I will create an image to buttress that perception.\" The power to alter images is a cause of great concern among forensic image examiners and by those who depend upon their images to convey impartial information regarding a scene or object. Elements within an image can be fabricated, enhanced, distorted, shifted, cloned, erased Top: Gulf Breeze photo #19. The road edges are only well defined near the UFO, suggesting they were illuminated by it. (Digital image by J. Sainio) Bottom: Figure 3 - Same photo with red dropped out, hood contrast- enhanced.

Those who doubt the creative potential of digital image processing should see the film Ter- minator II. This is not to imply that Mr. Sainio is such an aficionado or possesses either the facilities or the expertise required to produce the spectacular special effects of Terminator II, but digital image processing, even in primitive form, is a highly manipulative process capable of changing an image into something it isn't in order to highlight certain features and/or subdue others at the personal discretion of the operator. Mr. Sainio's article in this issue of the Mufon UFO Jour- nal is highly critical of my photo analyses on several points. In fact, there is practically nothing good he has to say about it. The best he has to offer is 1) to acknowledge that he \"had access to excellent copies, or originals as needed,\" of the Walters' photographs, which I was denied and 2) to speculate that I didn't have the equivalent digital image processing and densitometric instrumentation that he purportedly applied to his analyses. On the first point, Mr. Sainio is quite correct. My opi- nions were based on the analyses of 2nd and 3rd-generation photographic prints, reportedly rephotographed under un- favorable conditions by Mr. Walter Andrus, who officially commissioned my study for MUFON. Some of these im- ages were totally unsuitable for scientific analysis. My re- quest for the original Walters' Polaroid prints, or at least professionally produced copies of those prints, was ignored. It is a fact of life in the field of image analysis that the quality of information that can be derived from a photographic print is only as good as the quality of the print itself. Some image information is lost and new artifacts (light reflections, finger prints, scratches, etc. on the print sur- faces being copied) are added in going from one genera- tion to the next in the photocopying process. On his second point, Mr, Sainio is dead wrong. I have access to the most advanced digital image processing in- strumentation and software, but I draw upon these facilities with upmost care and discretion for reasons cited above. Photography has evolved over the past 150 years to become by far the most accurate medium known to man for recording the real world as we humans actually see it. Tampering with these images for the intended purpose of revealing things that are not visually apparent in them is an exercise that can easily lead an overzealous photo analyst out of reality and into the realm of pseudo-science. n is also worth noting that Mr. Walters strictly for- bade me from publishing his copyrighted photographs. In compliance with those demands, none of his photographs in original or enhanced form have.been included in any of my reports or articles. This explains why my article in the Mufon UFO Journal was practically devoid of illustrations. It is not my purpose here to discuss the technical details of Mr. Sainio's work or of mine. These are matters that are better addressed in a journal devoted to photographic science. I can't comment objectively on most of Mr. Sainio's reported findings because he worked with original prints and excellent copies, while I had access to neither. This gross inequality poses an interesting series of questions. Was it because I insisted from the very beginning that I had no preconceived notions regarding the authenticity of the Walters' photographs and that my analysis would be focused on seeking out the real truth whatever the consequences? Would the same restrictions on the availability of photographs have been ap- plied to Mr. Sainio if his approach had been the same as mine? If not, why not? Was it because Mr. Sainio was will- ing to direct his efforts in opposition to those who challenged the authenticity of the Walters' photographs, in which case he obtained the full cooperation of Mr. Walters? I don't know the answers to these specific questions, but now that Mr. Sainio has gained access to the original Walters' photographs, these and other questions will continue to re- main unanswered, and will fester in the minds of many MUFON members and the general public (except those who subscribe to Sainio's theory that the illusion of fakery is an indigenous feature of the UFO experience) until his findings are thoroughly corroborated. These corroborative analyses should be performed by at least two other photo analysts selected for their impartiality, so the controversy that sur- rounds the Walters' Gulf Breeze photographs can hopefully be settled once and for all. S pecial attention needs to be given to photograph num- ber 19, the controversial \"road shot,\" in which Mr. Sainio claims to have detected what \"may or may not be a UFO reflection\" in the hood of the truck and a \"pattern of increased pavement illumination beneath photo #19's power ring\" which \"corresponds to what would be expected in a real setting.\" I could find neither. I am also skeptical of photograph number 18 showing three UFO-like objects that blend with the colors of their immediate backgrounds. Mr. Sainio defends the validity of this photograph with his \"blue-moon\" analogy, which I consider to be grossly in- ept. Of course, both of us could be right with regard to these photographs for those willing to accept his more general \"illusion-of-fakery\" theory. In the final analysis, when scientific opinions differ, it is the objectivity and credibility of the investigators that must determine the issues. Several UFO investigators have asked me if I intend to continue any further with this investigation. The answer is no; my future scientific pursuits carry me to much higher ground  - William G.

Ware Log #920903: On July 4, 1992 about 9:30 p.m., a 32-year- old, self-employed man and his brother photographed nine red lights that appeared to be on a triangular-shaped object off Route 302 near Pinebush, NY; investigator, Dana M. Schmidt. The object made a hissing sound. The witnesses had a new Canon camera with 100-300mm zoom lens and 1600ASA Kodacolor print film and were looking for UFOs at a local \"hotspot.\" Shutter speed was automatic, but estimated at 1/15 second. Four photos were taken and the best three were analyzed using a PCD Film Scanner Model 2000 and put on a Compact Disk attached to a Model 2400 Work Station. The three largest lights were mostly white on the film, apparently caused by overexposure. The tops of the lights appeared flattened in the most distant photo, indicating possible shielding from structure. Log #920701E: From June 20 to December 31, 1991, be- tween 7:01 and 10:27 p.m., the Gulf Breeze Research Team reported 68 UFO sightings (on 63 days) in and around Gulf Breeze, FL; investigators, Anne Morrison, et al. The number of named witnesses ranged from 3 to 40. Video was obtained on 51 sightings and still photographs on 40. The duration of 52 sightings was at least a minute, with the longest at nine minutes. Triangulation data was obtained on 21 sightings, with a range to witnesses varying from 1/2 to 8 and 1/2 miles. Most were red lights that frequently became brilliant white. A green glow was often seen. On three sightings the structure of a craft was seen. Other testimony from experienced witnesses include: six whitish-yellow lights in a semi-circle; a circle of amber-gold lights traveled NW, did a complete loop, went up and faded; a ring of 8-10 white lights; a pale reddish-orange, oval-shaped object with dark window-like markings vertically on the side. On 30 occa- sions unidentified lights seemed to be ejected from the objects. Log #920702E: January 6-25, 1992, between 9:12 and 10:01 p.m., one or two UFOs were seen on seven occasions by the Gulf Breeze Research Team; investigator, Anne Mor- rison. The number of named witnesses ranged from 11 to 33. The UFOs were photographed on all occasions and recorded on video six times. Durations ranged from three to six minutes. Photos of the UFO using a diffraction grating showed the spectra of the red phase to be quite unlike that of a road flare. They often appear stationary, regardless of the wind, and sometimes move indepedent of the wind. On January 10, two UFOs moved closer together. One photo by Bland Pugh showed a clear ring of reddish light. They seem to appear because the witnesses are there, although tri- a'ngulation data indicates they didn't come closer than about 2 and 1/4 miles. Log #911208E: November 23, 1990, a 55-year-old registered nurse, the MUFON Field Investigator of this case, and her husband took friends visiting from Georgia to the Gulf Breeze end of the Pensacola Bay bridge to look for a UFO. It appeared for four minutes at 8:47 p.m.; investigator, Anne Morrison. They saw a bright, white light to the south, 15-20° above the horizon. It turned a bright, fiery red and slowly appeared to get larger and brighter. It dimmed twice and then got brighter. The third time it turned white as it dimmed from view. It could be seen longer through binoculars. It reappeared for a few seconds as a white light. It appeared larger and brighter than the red light on top of the Gulf Breeze water tower. Three other witnesses had an indepen- dent sighting of the UFO. Log #911209E: January 6, 1989 at about 11 p.m., a retired teacher and her friend, while driving to Gulf Breeze across the Pensacola Bay bridge, saw an orange-ball UFO to the southeast: investigator, Joe Barren. She said it appeared as wide as two fingers at arm's length. The bright, orange light was slightly darker at the top where it bulged slightly. After about five minutes, when they got to the south end of the bridge, it disappeared. She felt it went straight up. (The ob- ject described is similar to the orange balls photographed at Pensacola Beach in 1988 and elsewhere around the world. Evidence I have seen indicates witnesses are seeing orange photons coming from the air surrounding a vehicle. —DW) Log #911210E: From January 1 to June 18, 1991, between 6 and 12 p.m., 42 sightings of unidentified lights were re- corded by members of the Gulf Breeze Research Group; in- vestigator, Anne Morrison. The number of named witnesses ranged from 1 to 30. Usually just one object/light was seen, but sometimes two or three appeared. Video and photographs were taken on many occasions. Infrared film and a diffrac- tion grating were occasionally used. The UFO often ap- peared as a brilliant white light, which changed to bright red and back to white at various times. Sometimes it pulsed. Occasionally, white-over-red, or a greenish glow or flash was seen. It hovered, moved slowly (against the wind) and sometimes changed direction. It, or they, normally departed by winking out, slowly fading out, or rapidly streaking away. During the six-month period, one hoax was discovered, on April 1st, when investigators suspicious of a pale green light found two people on the Gulf beach pulling in a green, lighted object. They fled in a small red car before they were identified. (The appearance and behavior of one of the 42 sightings causes it to be considered a possible hoax.) Sometimes structure has been seen behind the light. These sightings are considered significant. The Gulf Breeze \"red light\" UFOs continue to be seen often enough for anyone with a little persistence to go out and see one.

The object was observed through the windshield for about 20 seconds as it moved from south to north \"at a speed similar to or slower than a commercial jet taking off.\" It had no wings, no tail, no vertical stabilizer, and no visible markings. A white light, like reflected sunlight, came from the top front portion. Log 0911212E: November 11, 1990, 4:10 a.m., sighting over Big Lagoon near Pensacola, FL for one hour and 35 minutes by two fishermen and an independent witness. It received a rating of highly strange and highly credible; investigator, Joe Barren. Fisherman #1 felt compelled to go fishing at the unusual hour of 1 a.m., and he persuaded fisherman #2 to go with him. A light that first appeared as a white star, low over the barrier island to the south, got bigger and then appeared yellow, red and blue in alternating sequences. It came about half way across the intercoastal waterway, 1/2 to 1/4 mile away, and moved up and down. Low, orange light from the \"energy base\" was seen reflected from the water. It had a bright red light on top, a single row of four windows that they could see near the mid-section, and a lighted dome and ring near the bottom that rotated. Light from the quarter-moon reflected off the left side of the craft, which looked metallic. Several times it shot blue beams to the water. The object would sometimes move so fast it ap- peared to be in two places at once. One fisherman tried to mentally \"talk\" to the object, and it appeared to react to his thoughts. Fisherman #2 drove to the nearest phone and called TV-3, but he could only get their answering service. He then called the MUFON hotline; but, since the object was not in sight from the phone, the investigator, who had had very little sleep, only took his name and number. The fisherman did get the tag number of another witness who refused to identify himself; when located by Joe Barren, he gave sup- porting evidence. Before the object departed to the southwest, an airplane circled it. The object shot out a \"red ball of light,\" which the airplane followed. Also, a barge was reported to have passed close to the object, but it is unknown if people on the barge saw it. Log #911214E: Summer 1965 about 8 p.m., a UFO followed an 8-year-old boy and his father as they drove to a gas sta- tion in a rural area near Salem, NH; investigators, Ann- Marie Tessier and Cheryl Powell. The boy felt terror and panic and said he \"was scared because my mother was home alone\" with no one to protect her. He thought it was another flying saucer. It was cigar-shaped and had white lights \"so bright there was a haziness around it.\" It appeared the size of an audio cassette at arm's length, and he thinks it was about 300 feet away. The father got the gas station atten- dant to look at it, but neither of these people could be interviewed. The boy did not remember the planned visit to relatives that evening, and he felt this missing time was very strange. He said he, his brother, and his parents have seen strange figures in the parents' bedroom and around the home, but he fears investigation through hypnotic regression. Log #920803E: On March 6, 1991 at 9 a.m., a 92-year-old gentleman and his housekeeper observed a \"sun-sized\" very brilliant light that appeared to land on Mount Kearsarge in New Hampshire; investigator, Vail Leach. During a five- minute descent down the side of the mountain, the object left a ribbon of yellow and white light in its wake. The rib- bon and the UFO had a silver outline, and a flashing red light was seen on or near the object. When it reached the bottom, the UFO turned whiter, and a lot of smoke came up from the base of the mountain. At that time, the ribbon of light started disintegrating from the top down at the same speed that it formed. The object changed direction just before it stopped, and it was seen for another 15 minutes before it disappeared. Log #920805E: On June 27, 1992 at 12:25 a.m., a 29-year- old nurse's assistant and her mother saw a UFO on the ground in Raeford, NC; investigators, Rick Heldreth and Wayne Laporte. They were preparing to retire when they heard a roaring train-like sound pass from behind their mobile-home toward a field across the street. It caused the home to shake. The sound suddenly stopped as they went to the front window. About 150 yards to the east was a curved row of about 10 reddish-orange \"windows\" close to the ground. Their dusk-to-dawn light was out and so was their neighbor's to the west. They called the sheriff and reported a downed aircraft, or something odd. About 10 minutes after it landed, they went out to get a better look, and as they turned the front porch light on, the UFO blinked out. Then the two dusk-to-dawn lights came back on, and three others farther east went out. Moments later six of the sheriffs cars arrived with two deputies each. Oddly, none of the witnesses' eight dogs barked, even when the deputies arrived, and the cats were nowhere to be seen. Some deputies reported hear- ing the noise as it passed by their office a few miles away. The next morning a 15-foot diameter nest was found in the field where the grass was swirled, depressed and discolored in the center. On July 11, during the MUFON investigation, a compass that acted normally outside of the circle would continuously swing 25-30° either side of north while in the center. The gentleman claiming to represent military in- telligence at Fort Bragg conducted a strange interview with the witnesses. Newspaper coverage of the sighting led to a local CE-4 report. Log #920806E: On March 24, 1992 at 7:35 p.m., a 33-year- old housewife, her husband and four chidren saw a 90-foot- long object that separated into three pieces over their home in Havelock, NC; investigator, John W. Patterson. When MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 294 October 1992"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"the primary witness went out to get the laundry, she saw the object hovering over the woods about 1/2 mile away. After she got her husband and children, it moved to a position low over their house and the neighbor's house. The right section had four, soft white lights in a diamond \"formation.\" The left section was of undetermined form with one, and later two, red lights on it. The center portion appeared to be an unlit gray rectangle. Then the red light section moved to the west, behind their tree in the backyard. Then the white light section came slowly toward them, to within 100 feet or less. They ran through the house into the front yard. The diamond formation of white lights then moved slowly to the NE, and the red light section was not seen again. Their sighting lasted about 25 minutes. At 8:15 p.m, a few blocks away, two 11-year-old boys reported a diamond-shaped solid- white light that came from the NW, silently circled above the tree-tops and then climbed away toward Cherry Point Naval Air Station. Log #920807E: On June 2, 1992 at 10:20 p.m., a 47-year- old interior designer saw two Saturn-shaped objects near Pittsford, NY; investigator, George K. Hoenig. She first saw a light through the windshield, stopped on a siding, got out and watched two identical objects, one 75 to 100 feet behind the other, fly toward Rochester at about 200 feet above the ground. They crossed the road at about 60° elevation and went out of sight in about three minutes. They each had four evenly spaced prongs on the bottom with a round, spherical, white light on the end of each. A steady, red light was centered in the middle, and the body was charcoal-black and shiny. Log #920808E: On March 9, 1992 at 6:30 p.m., two boys, ages 10 and 8, were playing in a cemetery in Arnold, PA when a disk-shaped object shined a white beam on them; investigator, Dennis M. Stadterman. It had the sound of a jet and appeared to be the size of a bus. It appeared to have two headlights as it approached. It was gray and shaped like number C-14 on the standard silhouette sheet, with a row of lights around the perimeter and a beam coming down the center. It hovered and fluttered, and seemed to follow one of the boys as they ran home. A red and blue light was also seen in a wooded area near the cemetery. A police report was filed. Log #920901E: On September 7, 1992 at 7:24 a.m., a 40-year-old lady observed a silver-colored object shaped like two cereal bowls placed rim-to-rim, some 200 to 300 feet away, in East Berlin, CT; investigators, Christopher Schmitt and Robert Newth. She spotted it above the road to the west as she turned south. It turned south and lifted up to follow the contour of two groups of trees. She lost sight of it after about 30 seconds when it went behind other trees while 40 to 50 feet above the ground. Log #920902E: On November 11, 1987 at about 5:30 p.m., a 38-year-old mother and her 15-year-old son were followed by a \"crown-shaped\" UFO as'ihey drove on Highway 98 West to Delchamps in Gulf Breeze, FL; investigator, Joe Barren. The mother said it looked exactly like the first ob- ject photographed by Ed Walters. She reported it to The Sen- tinel but did not give her hame. She described it as calmly floating along at tree-top level, keeping pace with her car and moving to and fro like a feather. The whole structure glowed and lit up the inside of the car. Each time they talked about it, it would get brighter. When she parked, it hovered, and she put a mark on the windshield to mark its position. The next thing they remember, it was dark, and when she checked the mark on the windshield, the UFO was still there. Then it shot up and was gone in an instant. They bought three items and got home after 8:30 p.m. They had lost at least two hours and five minutes. Strangely, the husband was found in bed when they got home, well before his normal bed time. He seemed unconcerned about their late return. All four members of this family have experienced numerous strange events, the mother since age five. These include bedroom visits by big-eyed entities, recent dreams by the husband and wife of abduction-like experiences together, and strange marks on the skin. Case investigation continues with regression planned. Log #910902E: On October 6, 1990 at about 9:45 p.m., a 32-year-old salesman saw a disk-shaped object for about 20 seconds in Maiden, MA. The metallic-gray disk with six lights around the perimeter hovered over a church about 355 feet away. The lights were blue/green, orange/yellow, and purple/blue. When the witness got out of the car and pointed to it, it moved about 400 feet to the right in less than a second, hovered for a moment behind some trees, and then vanished. He said, as he approached the church, he could feel the presence of the object, like a vibration in his head. The other witness, who drove the car, refused to talk about it. A few minutes prior to this close sighting, both gentlemen had seen two lights in the sky that appeared too low to be stars.

MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 294 October 1992"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"EDITOR'S COLUMN I recently received a letter from a female UFO investigator and author who accused me of being \"involved in an organization with flaws,\" and one, moreover, composed mainly of \"chauvinistic men who don't want women around.\" The reason for this outburst seems to have been occasioned by the fact that we haven't yet gotten around to reviewing her book, and presumably favorably at that. The author went on to point out that \"someone called my publisher to tell them I am the first female writer (aside from England's Jenny Randies) of a book on UFO research.\" I pointed out that I lived in a country with flaws. Was I supposed to resign my citizenship as a consequence and move to another country without flaws? And as far as I knew, neither MUFON nor the MUFON UFO Journal had ever claimed to be picture-perfect or fault-free. I also noted that Janine Vallee, Ann Druffel and Coral Lorenzen had long ago co-authored several significant books on the UFO sub- ject. True, they were only listed as co-authors, but I under- stand, in the case of the books by the Lorenzens in particular, that Coral actually did the majority of the writing. In addi- tion, there was The UFO Encyclopedia (Putnam, NY 1980), authored by Margaret Sachs. I haven't gone through my own personal library with a fine-tooth comb yet, but I feel cer- tain that somewhere out there lurks the name of another North American female who can lay claim to being both a bona fide UFO researcher and book author prior to this latest claim. I also pointed out that the Journal hadn't yet reviewed books by male authors Keith Thompson (Angels and Aliens), Jacques Vallee (Revelations) and David Jacobs (Secret Life). In other words, our \"transgressions\" could best be measured by a lack of time and resources rather than by any ingrained attitudes toward gender. B ut the letter did get me to thinking. How involved were women in UFO research? Was serious ufology solely the province of male \"tekkies,\" or did female researchers and writers have a significant role to play in UFO investiga- tions? The answer quickly resolved itself. Glancing through the last two years of the Journal alone, I encountered ar- ticles, reviews and letters authored or co-authored by female contributors Ann Druffel, Virginia Tilly, Victoria Lacas, Elaine Douglass, Cynthia Newby Luce, Carol Salisberry, Mildred Biesele and Anne MacFie. England's Jenny Randies also contributes regularly to the Journal. (I could mention several male names belonging to various ethnic minorities, too, but we'll confine ourselves for now to women.) In general, MUFON and ufology as a whole seem to have been fairly forward-thinking. For example, MUFON and the Fund for UFO Research currently award an annual $500 cash prize to the most deserving ufologist of the year. The award is named in honor of the late Isabel Davis (founder of New York City's Civilian Saucer Intelligence) and the most recent recipient was none other than Linda Moulton Howe, presently MUFON's director of Media Relations. In the past Ann Druffel, Mildred Biesele, Marge Christensen, Rosetta Holmes and Norma Short were all simultaneously listed in the Journal's masthead in one prominent capacity or another, from editor emeritus to director of public rela- tions. Teresa Brito-Asenap recently served as chairperson for the highly successful MUFON annual symposium held this year in Albuquerque, NM. N or do I mean to suggest that the relationship between each and every one of these individuals and MUFON as an organization has always been a case of roses and more roses, only that few if any have ever complained openly of blatant male chauvinism. And outside MUFON proper, the list goes on and on, to include Vicki Cooper and Sheri Stark of UFO magazine, Phyllis Galde of Fate and Pamela Wein- traub of Omni. Mimi Hynek, widow of the late Dr. J. Allen Hynek, has also made a significant contribution to ufology, as has any other wife or mother — and their names are legion — who have had to put up with their \"husband's hobby\" over the years. So I categorically reject any notion or implication that ufology is a bastion of male Anglo-Saxon chauvinism. Com- pare our record with that of the Committee for the Scien- tific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal (CSICOP), for instance, and I think you'll find there's little to debunk. CONNECTION, Continued can be objectively explained as scientific, ethical or non- hostile. But for now, there' are too many gray areas overall, which may involve a hidden and more sinister agenda. My friend's story, with the illustrious credentials of his source, is extraordinary. For both to surface, despite anonymity, is an example of courage when I consider they are not in lock step with the mainstream of scientific ra- tionale. It may also prove difficult for the myopic media to put the story into reportorial perspective, especially when the mindset of the average citizen is mainly concerned with traditional mundane affairs. I have every reason to believe the word of my physicist friend, just as I have believed my medical informants who provided firsthand information to me about the alien anatomy. When I questioned my friend about his source's veracity or whether he may be playing the disinformation game, he replied, as an analogy, that he had always believed his mother and was quick to put his colleague in the same entrusting category.

Webb November 1992 • Bright Planets (Evening Sky): Venus (magnitude -4.1) is easier to see at dusk low in the SW, not setting until about two and a quarter hours after sunset in mid-November. The resplendent planet lies 5° below the lunar crescent on the 27th. Mars, in Gemini, increases in brightness by another half magnitude during November, from -0.2 to -0.7, and closes the gap with Earth by some 17 million miles. Our red- dish neighbor rises in the ENE about 9 PM on the 1st and about 7:30 by month's end. It is 5° below Pollux on November 4, the first of three passes by the star — a tri- ple conjunction. The second conjunction occurs next month after Mars begins retrograding westward (on November 29). The red planet is also near the gibbous Moon on the night of the 14th-15th. Saturn (0.7), in Capricornus, stands low in the S at dusk and sets in the WSW about 10 PM. The Moon is near Saturn on the night of November 1-2 and the 29th. • Bright Planets (Morning Sky): Mars stands high in the SW at dawn. Jupiter (-1.8), in Virgo, rises about 2:30 AM in midmonth and is well up in the SE at dawn. • Meteor Shower: The slowest (17 miles per second) of all major meteor showers, the South Taurids, peaks about November 2, although some shower members can be seen all month. While the reddish Taurids normally are visible all night, observe them after midnight when the bright quarter Moon has set. About 10-15 meteors per hour are the pre-dawn rate expected. • Moon Phases: First quarter — November 2 Full moon — November 10 Last quarter — November 17 New Moon — November 24 • The Stars: The bright constellations of winter — Orion the Hunter, Taurus the Bull, Auriga the Chariot-driver, Gemini the Twins — are already appearing above the eastern horizon at 9 PM in midmonth. The dim stars of autumn, including the Great Square of Pegasus, occupy the central southern sky. In the west the Summer Triangle prepares to exit the celestial scene. In midevening look for a faint patch of light almost square- ly overhead (from midnorthern latitudes) in Andromeda the Princess. You are glimpsing our sister spiral galaxy in space, the Andromeda Galaxy, the most remote object detectable with the naked eye. This immense gathering of billions of stars appears not as it is today but as it was two billion years ago. It required that much time for its feeble light to journey across space and enter our eyes. And this is one of the nearest of all galaxies! The Double Cluster — two blobs of light some 25° N of the Andromeda spiral — is much closer to us, in fact within our own galaxy. Light from these twin clusters of hundreds of stars takes a mere 7,000 and 8,000 years to get here. The Double Cluster is a special treat for those using optical aid. LABORATORY, Continued Preliminary Conclusions One conclusion which appears justified is that if this witness is telling the truth at all, which I believe she is on various grounds, her estimates of angular and linear size of the airborne object are quite consistent. Another conclusion is that this case is similar to other Close En- counters of the First Kind in several respects: a) credible eyewitnesses report seeing an apparently solid, three- dimenionsal aerial object which hovers and moves silently; and b) the object displays remarkable flight dynamics which exceed those dynamics which characterize our own terrestrial technology. What is different here is the strange prolonged period of memory loss for the event which is highly characteristic of abductions. There is no way to be sure that there was or was not an abduction in this case. Footnotes 1. Lisa's car was parked at position B. She recalled that they never shut off their engine. Mrs. R.W. had to get out of her (two-door) car in order to let Lisa get out. Both walked over to Lisa's car at some point. 2. Mrs. R.W. stated that one of the main functions of the facility was as a PBX switch design laboratory. There were about 2,000 employees there at the time. 3. A more accurate estimate of the distance to the UFO from the loca- tion of the eye witnesses was at least 235 feet. If the object subtended a visual angle of about D deg arc at this distance it would have had to be N feet across: D = 8, N = 33; D = 12, N = 50; D = 16, N = 67. All of these values are well within the values given above, based upon Mrs. R. W.'s sketch of the UFO relative to the building. 4. When questioned about this statement, Mrs. R.W. said that the UFO moved without accelerating or jumping around. She was impressed with the fact that an object that large could hover almost silently, rise instantaneously, and then fly away so smoothly. 5. Dr. Richard Sigismund.

Annual State/Provincial Director's Meeting Two items of business recommended by the State Direc- tors to the MUFON Board of Directors concerned member- ship cards and a leadership qualification form for their use to help select competent and qualified State Section Direc- tors. The following revisions have been instituted with regard to Journal Subscribers and Field Investigator Trainees: each will receive an I.D. card marked \"Member.\" Previously, Journal Subscribers (JSB) did not receive an I.D. card, whereas Field Investigator Trainees (FIT) were so designated on their card. All other position categories will be treated as indicated on the back of the membership application form. The changes were made to prevent Field Investigator Trainees from conducting investigations on their own without an accompanying Field Investigator. Journal Subscribers will now be issued membership cards, so they will receive re- duced admission price to MUFON functions when such benefits are offered to members versus the general public.
