FROM THE EDITOR In testimony before Congress, scientist Barry Commoner stressed the importance of asking the right question: \"In general terms there are three ways that a presumably scientific analysis may arrive at a faulty conclusion: (a) The question addressed by the analysis is inappropriate- ly stated; (b) the data employed in the analysis are inaccurate; (c) the analytical procedures are faulty. The first of these faults is particularly serious since it is likely to result in the use of inappropriate data and analytical procedures as well.\" When we ask, \"Are UFOs extraterrestrial?\" (\"or other dimension- al?\", etc.) we are stating the question inappropriately, invoking selec- tive data, and slanting our analytical procedures. The question that needs to be asked is, \"What are the stimuli or referents of UFO re- ports?\" The correct answer to that some 90% of the time is conven- tional objects or phenomena, so we need to further refine the ques- tion by adding '\". . .that describe phenomena of appreciable size and duration, \"high strangeness,\" and remain unexplained after competent investigation and careful screening against possible familiar or known objects (e.g., meteors, advertising aircraft).\" No UFO report should be considered an accurate datum until it undergoes this process.

My wife and three daughters were spending the summer in Guanajuato, Gto., Mexico, where my wife was studying Spanish at the University of Guanajuato. They had rented a small house atop a mountain next to the city. I had joined the family for a week's visit, and we had just spent the day sightseeing around the area, re- turning to the house at dusk. It was at 8:10 p.m., Sunday even- ing, August 6, 1967, that I was just outside the house, leaning against a fencepost, looking at the beautiful mountains, watching dusk turn to nightfall, seeing the brighter stars begin to appear. As I happened to be looking at the horizon to the south- west, I saw coming over the mountain ridge in the far distance what I thought to be some jet airplanes com- ing toward me. I fly a lot, and am still no expert on judging altitudes of craft, but I would guess these craft were perhaps flying at 10,000 to 20,000 feet. I noticed that they also seemed to be flying at a much faster speed than anything I had observed before. As the craft came closer and closer, I could see more and more of what they were. The first thing ap- parent was that there were four very bright bluish-white lights in formation, abreast of each other, and I could de- finitely tell by their movement that they were four craft, each separate from the others. Streaming way out behind each white light was a long phosphorescent bluish-white comet- like tail, shimmering much like an artist's conception of a comet. As the craft approached closer, I then saw there was fifth craft in formation following the other four from behind. This craft was a bright red light, and had no comet-like tail behind it. The red light was pulsating very fast, much like a fast heartbeat, going bright, dim, bright, dim. It ap- peared much different from our usual red flashing warning light as seen on most conventional aircraft, and the flashing rate was much faster, much like opening and closing one's fist as fast as possible. While the craft were directly over- head, at the best possible viewing point for me, the red craft passed up the other four craft to assume the lead position. The interesting thing here is that its acceleration was phenomenal. It passed up the other craft in the time it takes to snap one's fingers. . .it liter- ally zipped ahead of the others. It stayed in the lead position the rest of the time as far as I was able to observe them as they went on out of sight over the northeast horizon. I believe I saw the craft for about one full minute, from horizon to hori- zon. After they passed overhead, I thought to call to my wife and chil- dren, and they ran out in time to see them about the last 40 degrees of the pass. Since it was just dark, I could not see the craft themselves, but only the light which they emitted. Now here is a most unusual as- pect. As the craft approached, and were closer, about 30 degrees up in the pass to 30 degrees from the end of the pass, I could see many smaller colored lights appearing and disap- pearing around the craft. These smaller lights were very confusing at first, and I didn't know if I was seeing many smaller satellite craft or what. Here is what I saw oc- curring around each of the four white- Walter Blaney with Merv Griffin light craft (and not around the red- light craft). At a steady pace, there appeared small green and red (and perhaps other colors as well) lights that popped into view at a small dis- tance behind a white light. They moved in a forward manner, passing up the white light, then vanishing at a small distance in front of the white light. It finally occurred to me that if the white light were at the center of a saucer-shaped craft, and if the smaller colored lights were around the perimeter of the saucer, and if the saucer were slowly spinning, and if the saucer were on its side as it passed over me, then I was observing each light as it came around into view from behind, passed up the center of the craft, and disappeared out of sight as it went around the other side of the craft. If my assumption was correct, I was not able to see how many lights were around the perimeter of the sau- cer, so could not accurately estimate how many revolutions per second each craft was turning. If I were to guess, from what I recall seeing, I would say about two or three revolutions in 5 seconds. During the whole pass, there was no sound whatsoever from the craft. I recall hearing a dog barking down (Continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"(Mexico, continued) the mountain side in town at the very moment the five craft were directly overhead, and it dawned on me that I heard nothing from the craft at all. The atmosphere was 100% clear with no pollution. Since I was on a moun- tain top, I was away from any city light, so viewing was exceptionally good that night. And finally, I was not the only observer of these UFO's. In Spanish they are called OVNI's, for \"objeto volando ni indentificado\" . . .objects flying not identified. Apparently the craft came in over the ocean at Tamp- ico, hovered there a few minutes, went to the airport in Mexico City and hovered there, made a long sweep in- land when I saw them over Guanajua- to, and passed on to Veracruz, hovered there, then back over the ocean again. The newspapers in Mexico were full of headline stories for several weeks after the sighting. All reports described the craft almost exactly as I have de- scribed them. Thousands of Mexican people observed them. In Vera Cruz and at the airport in Mexico City, the red-light craft descended from the formation to hover close to the ground, observe, return to the forma- tion, and the formation zipped away. In the reports it was mentioned that the ability of the'craft to accelerate and decelerate, and to change direc- tion was phenomenal. If these craft are of this world, and perhaps some secret possession of a major world power, it seems unlikely that they would be flying around such populated areas for all to observe. One more strange note is that upon my re- turn to the USA I found that no one had read or seen on any news media any report of this exceptionally good sighting by so many thousands of peo- ple, all reporting substantially exactly the same descriptions of these OVNI's, or UFO's. If I am right that this story was indeed not reported in the USA, I find this fact incredible. Prelude I was lucky to have a very good view of the craft as they passed direct- ly overhead. Once having seen these UFO's, I of course believe in what I saw, and know them to be craft far advanced from anything the general public knows about as far as conven- tional aircraft are concerned. But I also know it is easy to be fooled by what one sees, and I have seen unusual \"lights\" before, as have so many citi- zens, and have been tempted to say \"I have seen a flying saucer.\" Once when driving on the high- way to Dallas from my home in Houston, I saw many cars stopped along the road about 6 pjn. with pas- sengers all out looking at a strange and bright white light in the sky, hovering almost motionless. After a few moments, it was apparent that it was a meteorological balloon, with the sun catching it just right for a few moments to reflect a brilliant light in- to our eyes. As the sun lowered, one could see it was a large balloon. The most interesting \"sighting experience\" I had was way out in west Texas, on the flat prairie, 30 miles away from the nearest town, and far away from the nearest ranch house. It was at the rim of a large cavern known as Devil's Sinkhole. My best friend, whom I had known since col- lege days, and I had driven out there to inspect the sinkhole, as we were amateur spelunkers. We had just fin- ished a cookout supper, it was dusk, and my friend was telling me about a strange occurrence that happened to him the night before, near his ranch some several hundred miles away. A strange light appeared in the sky approaching him at incredible speed as he drove down the highway toward it. As it came closer and closer, he turned his truck around and headed the other way. Then the light stopped, went back in the other direction, then came at him once more, then turned and went on away out of sight. I was thinking what a thrill it would be if we could see such a sight while we were out on the prairie. And just at that moment this very thing happened. From way off in the dis- tance there appeared all of a sudden a light speeding toward us at incredible speed, getting brighter and brighter, changing color slightly as it came, from bluish, to yellowish, to reddish, etc. We jumped behind trees, got our guns ready in case we would need them, and were in a great state of ex- citement. The light got very bright, yet there were no roads, railroads or airports anywhere for miles around. The light seemed to stop, then head back away from us, then come closer, then back away again, etc. After sev- eral minutes of this, I tried lining up the light over a fencepost, and I no- ticed it never went to the right or the left, only directly toward us or away from us. As I watched further, I no- ticed it kept appearing slightly and slowly higher and higher above the top of the fencepost I was using as a sighting bar. As time went on, and the minutes passed, we realized that what we were seeing was the planet Mars, which was very close to the earth at that point in time. We were observing it as it ap- peared in the sky at dusk, as it came up through the atmosphere. The slight strata of haze would cause the light reflected off the planet to dim or increase, according to the haze thickness, which also accounted for the change in color. As a light source brightens it appears to come closer, as it dims, it appears to recede. If it brightens very fast, there is the illusion that it is approaching one at a very fast speed, and conversely if it dims quickly. We were able to watch Mars the rest of the night as it traveled across our Texas sky. By profession, I am a magician. By philosophy, I am a realist. I am looking for what is real in everything that I see. A magician must first under- stand what is real, in order to think of a clever way to perform his tricks in order to give an illusion of overcoming reality, which thus produces a great and fun entertainment form. And so I have been interested in UFO reports for years, knowing that so many re- ports were of phenomena easily ex- plained, such as the two I have men- tioned above. Many reports are of well meaning citizens who actually have seen strange lights in the sky, etc. I also knew that probably a very small percentage of the reports were accu- rate reportings of qualified individuals who knew what they saw was not any readily explainable light or sky phe-"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"AUSTRALIAN\"ALIEN HONEYCOMB\" ANALYZED By Mildred Biesele On the back cover of Alien Honeycomb by John Pinkney and Leonard Ryzman (Pan Original Paper- back, 1980), the publishers blurb: \"When the richly-colored UFO exploded over a vast, empty property in Queensland, Australia, its compo- nent pieces were scattered for more than three kilometres. Most of the wreckage â€” strange, intricate, eerily beautiful â€” is now held by the United States Air Force in maximum security vaults. But a few pieces of the craft were retrieved by private investigators. These pieces contain unknown ele- ments and configurations that will present science with new, fundament- al problems. The nature of those re- mains now raises disturbing questions for mankind.\" Bill Chalker, NSW-Australian MUFON Representative and coordi- nator of the Australian Physical Evi- dence Study Group, sends us his re- view of the book, a laboratory analy- sis of the material in the \"alien honey- (Mexico, continued) nomena or conventional aircraft from our planet. What was it these people were actually seeing that could not be explained by any of the sciences we know about? I believe the sighting I had in Mexico in 1967 was one of the latter. I saw unusual craft, flying in the air, manned by an intelligent being, or at least directed and controlled by an intelligent being. And the craft were able to perform in a far superior man- ner to any known conventional craft in our world society. If they are man- made, then someone here has the jump on everyone else by a long, long way, and I can't think of why and how it could be kept a secret so long, or why they allow the craft to be ob- served more and more each year. I am thus led to a conclusion that they must come from a world other than our own. comb,\" plus press coverage of the \"expose\" and an urgent plea for the Journal to set the record straight on this story before it is spread any farther. First a word about the book in general terms. Although anyone who tries to keep informed on the inter- national UFO front must be aware of continuing activity \"down under,\" Alien Honeycomb gives a sprightly survey of recent events in Australia and New Zealand. I was particularly interested to read about the numerous sightings surrounding the Valentich disappearance in 1978. However, Chalker in his review of the book criticizes the authors for a number of factual errors, and in their discus- sion of U. S. cases they are a little careless with detail. And Dr. Bruce \"MacCabee\"? With all the publicity that attended Dr. Maccabee's investi- gation of the Fogarty-Crockett film, they should have a record of how he spells his name. The book begins in Los Angeles where co-author Leonard Ryzman meets \"an engineer who had been as- sociated with the Apollo program,\" now an \"executive in the aircraft in- dustry ,\" who asks if there is any truth to the rumor he has heard about a UFO explosion over Queensland, leav- ing fragments that have been recover- ed. Ryzman replies that he doesn't know of any such event, but he will find out what he can about the story. His source of information will be his friend John Pinkney, a journalist and broadcaster in Melbourne who has been active in UFO research since the 1950's. When Ryzman returned home to Australia, he and Pinkney began to search for information about the UFO explosion, thumbing through Pink- ney's voluminous files and going through stacks of old newspapers at the public library in Melbourne. A lead suggesting a 1975 explosion in that area took Ryzman to Brisbane and to a fortuitous meeting with a young woman who happened to have \"a piece of a UFO\" and was willing to divide it with Ryzman. Later he visited the place where the fragment had been found on the isolated ranch of Mrs. Jean Fraser near Greenbank, 20 kilo- metres south of Brisbane. Mrs Fraser was kind enough to give him two larger pieces of the material that she had stored in her barn. The substance was a honeycomb of hexagons bonded to a hardened woven backing, the larger piece mold- ed into a curve on one end. The struc- ture of the material made it very light with high insulation value and great tensile strength. Whether it was \"eerily beautiful\" is hard to judge from the photographs. I do not think that a ruse or a hoax was intended when Pinkney and Ryzman leaped happily to the conclu- sion that what they had was the rem- nant of an object from another world. ' Rather, I think they were blinded by their enthusiasm and encouraged by those they consulted who should have cautioned them to use restraint. They concluded that the only analysis they could trust would be one underwritten by the United Nations, and they sent a letter to Secretary-General Kurt Waldheim notifying him of their find, offering the pieces to him and asking him to establish a committee to study UFOs which could then test and eval- uate this remarkable substance \"that could be the key, and the beginning of the unlocking of the door, to the mystery of the unidentified flying ob- ject.\" Meanwhile, back at the ranch, Dick Smith, a skeptical Sydney mil- lionaire, sent an investigator out to in- terview Mrs. Fraser and to pick up some more samples. These were sub- mitted to Dr. T. S. Hickie, Senior (Continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"(\"Honeycomb,\" continued) Lecturer in the School of Textile Technology at the University of NSW in Sydney. Dr. Hickie burst the bubble with a very mundane analysis of the alien honey comb: \". . .This analysis showed that the filaments consisted largely of silicon and calcium, with a medium amount of aluminium, a small amount of mag- nesium, trace amounts of iron and titanium and possibly very small traces of potassium, sulphur and chlorine. The elements identified and their pro- portions indicate that the material of the filaments of both fabrics is a glass similar in type to one commonly used in the manufacture of fibreglass. Note that there were no unknown elements present in the materials examined. . . \"It is concluded that the materials submitted for analysis are woven fab- rics in plain and sateen weaves and woven from multifilament fibreglass. They have obviously been in a fire and are covered with carbonaceous matter. \"It is highly likely that individual layers of the plain woven fabric have been thermally set into the forms nec- essary to fabricate the 'honeycomb' type of material. \"For your information, fibreglass yarn has been manufactured in quan- tity in many countries throughout the world since production of commercial grades began about 1938.\" This does not come as a surprise to anyone who has read the book warily, watching for any real evidence to connect the material with an ex- _ploding UFO. Mrs. Fraser observed a UFO over her ranch in 1966, and about a week later \"a classic saucer nest\" was found where it had appar- ently landed. (She saw it go down.) No explosion was seen by anyone in the area. Widely dispersed fragments of the honeycomb material were found 2 years later, first by Mr. Fraser and then by officers from Aberly Air Force Base when he noti- fied them of his find. Several officers came out to join the search and took pieces of the material, which they could not identify, back to the base with them. What seems to be a likely explana- tion for the presence of the honey- TRIANGULAR UFO: PRELIMINARY REPORT By Robert E. Morgan (MUFON Field Investigator) On the morning of Sept. 13, 1980 at 02:30 hrs (CST) Herb Van Gundy, 19, and three other persons were sleep- ing in a large tent at Hamilton Pool 26 miles northwest of Dripping Springs, Tex., when they were awakened by a scream by one of the girls. The tent was lit up with a faint yellow glow. Herb thought that one of the logs from the fire outside had rolled over and this is what she had seen. He went outside but the fire, was out. A loud humming sound caused him to look up, and at an altitude of 125 ft. was a triangle-shaped object with two lights at each tip, yellow and white, comb is suggested by Chalker. He says that in the 1950's and 1960's two Lib- erators and a Canberra bomber crashed in the Greenbank area. He adds, \"Hon- eycomb is widely used in aircraft fuser lage shells, wing skin panels, flying control surfaces, engine structures and cowlings, tail structures, doors, hatch- es, floors, interior trim and furnish- ings.\" I am not at heart a debunker. I feel a trace of guilt and regret in turn- ing thumbs down on a book I enjoyed and whose authors were appealing in their bubbling enthusiasm. In fact, it is with some dismay that I find myself with Phillip Klass, described by the Melbourne newspaper that quotes his (negative) reaction to the book as \"America's leading UFO private in- vestigator\"! But, I have to admit it. The \"alien honeycomb\" is full of holes. Editor's Note: Another important consideration is that various honey- comb materials have been used for many years in earth-orbiting satellites. Even if witnesses did observe the crash of a fiery object that left honey- comb debris, the most probable ex- planation would be a satellite decay (burning out in the atmosphere with fragments falling to earth). Unless evidence is advanced in contradiction, this seems to be the most likely ex- planation. red and green, blue and white. The object was moving to the north very slowly. Herb also saw three thrusters on the underside, (like nozzles on a rock- et), black on the inside and grey at the rim; nothing was coming from them. The underside was a greenish grey color, not reflection from lights. The object hovered for about 10 seconds and the humming sound started to make a pulsating hum. Herb said that it sounded like the object was about to stall. It then started to move to the north and the humming sound was continuous again. It moved over the hills and went out of sight, but the sound could still be heard for a while. Total sighting duration was about one minute. About 30 minutes earlier they had heard a loud explosion like a cannon being fired. The girls were in the can- yon and saw sparks from above the ledge. Herb heard the noise but did not see the sparks from the tent. Weather: National Weather Ser- vice in San Antonio, Tex. Calm and Mild. Temperature in the low 70's. Visibility good. Ceiling none. Clouds moved in over the Hill Country later that morning. Witness said he saw no clouds at the time of sighting. The sky was clear with very little wind.

Bryant The world of UFO research is fill- v ed with \"if-onlies.\" // only, for ex- ample, a UFO would stay grounded long enough for us to acquire the nec- essary empirical data. // only the so- called \"crashed saucer\" accounts could be further corroborated and then pre- sented in the appropriate public fo- rum. If only the U. S. Freedom of In- formation Act (FOIA) had been in force back in the early fifties. The latest of these exercises in what I call condition awareness centers on the recent revelation that the U. S. Army Counterintelligence Corps oper- ated (clandestinely, of course) an \"In- terplanetary Phenomenon Unit\" in the Pentagon. First discussed in the September 1979 issue of the newsletter Just Cause, this controversial, apparently UFO-related operation has become as much of a mystery as the whereabouts of certain hard-core UFO-encounter cases that never made it into the files of the USAF Project Blue Book. In- deed, the more the Army tries to down-play its role in official UFO re- search, the more reason we have for looking deeper into that role, especial- ly if we are to learn anything from the lessons of the CIA-UFO expose'. What's in a Name Of course, one can speculate for- ever on why the Army chose to label its UFO research project the \"Inter- planetary Phenomenon Unit.\" If you can accept the premise of the Roswell Incident's crashed-saucer account, in which the retrieval operation and sub- sequent coverup were engineered by the Army air force, then the obvious answer becomes, \"Why not label it 'Interplanetary . ..'?\" At any rate, unless the principals involved in the Unit's mission and functions come forward with detailed answers, it's likely that this mystery will linger as long as the UFO subject itself. Just who are those principals, and what role did they actually per- form? The trail leads back to a routine Freedom of Information inquiry dis- patched on September 6, 1980, by re- searcher Richard Hall. In addressing his letter to the Army's Assistant Chief of Staff for Intelligence, Hall sought copies of all Army records pertaining to the Defense Intelligence's Agency's June 2, 1980, teletype message de- scribing a Peruvian air force UFO en- counter. In reply on September 25th, the Director of Counterintelligence ex- plained, \"We regret to inform you that no record system is maintained within the offices of the Assistant Chief for Intelligence ... to catalog, process, in- dex or otherwise evaluate UFO in- formation. This agency has not been a recipient of subject message.\" The next paragraph of the Director's reply states: \"Please be advised that the In- terplanatary (sic) Phenomenon Unit of the Scientific and Technical Branch, Counterintelligence Directorate, De- partment of the Army, was disestab- lished during the late 1950's and never reactivated. All records pertaining to this unit were surrendered to the U. S. Air Force Office of Special Investiga- tions in conjunction with operation 'BLUEBOOK.' \" Now You See It, Now You Don't That explanation runs into troub- le when you recall that the OSI record- keepers have disavowed any know- ledge of the alleged records transfer (see Just Cause, Sept. 1979). How can such historically valuable records as these escape permanent account- ability? That question was uppermost in Richard Hall's mind when, on Octo- ber 1, 1980, he sent the following re- quest to the Army's chief records man- ager, the Adjutant General: Assuming that this Unit's organization- al history and charter, like similar re- cords of other Army agencies, are maintained as \"permanent files,\" I re- quest that, under provisions of the U. S. Freedom of Information Act, you provide me with copies of all government records pertaining to the Unit, such records to include the fol- lowing information: (1) The relevant Tables of Distribu- tion and Allowances; (2) The Unit's organization chart/ staff directory for each year of its ac- tivation; (3) Its standing operating procedure (including all revisions thereof); (4) Its Mission and Functions Manual (including all revisions thereof); (5) Its operating budget; (6) Its periodic Historical Reports as submitted to the Army's Chief of Military History; (7) Its legislative-liaison reports and evaluations; (8) Its project 'case files.' (If these case files no longer exist, or are in the custody of some other Federal De- partment/agency, please index them by title/date/subject/file number, and identify their departmental transfer record.) After waiting patiently for over a month without a reply, Hall sent a postcard reminder to the Adjutant General, who, a few days later, told him that his inquiry had been referred to - you guessed it - the Assistant Chief of Staff for Intelligence (ACSI). Finally, on November 29th, he re- ceived this carefully worded demurrer from the Director of Counterintelli- gence: The unit was formed as an \"in-house\" project by the Chief of the Scientific and Technical Branch, as an \"interest\" (Continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"(UFO Secrecy, continued) item for the ACSI. It was never formal- ly organized or reportable as such. It had no investigative function, mission or authority. The transfer of any re- cords, if they formally existed, oc- curred through the Office of the Ad- jutant General, DA, during the late 1950's. The establishment of the De- fense Intelligence Agency (DIA) ab- sorbed the functions, mission and personnel of the Scientific and Tech- nical Branch, and institutional memory recalls the transfer of the unit files to the U. S. Air Force \"Bluebook\" office. No transfer record exists in the files of this office. Stalking the Smokeless Gun As the story of the \"Interplane- tary Phenomenon Unit\" continues to resist unfolding, we're left with more questions than we began with. If we accept, at face value the Army's con- tention that the Unit amounted to no more than an intelligence analyst's whim, then we can move on to con- temporary pursuits. If, however, given our acquaintance with official ufo- logy's underground existence, we yield to our instincts, then we can't help concluding that the U. S. military intelligence community still maintains the key to the Unit's mystery. We know, for example, that cer- tain Army-originated UFO records are included in the Central Intelligence Agency's package of FOIA-released UFO documentation. Do some of those records reflect the files of the \"Interplanetary Phenomenon Unit\"? We know also that, despite claims to the contrary, the U. S. Defense In- telligence Agency easily can marshal â€” and has marshalled â€” its resources to- ward active investigation of UFO- sighting reports. Will the current FOIA litigation of Citizens Against UFO Secrecy vs. DIA produce some of the elusive files of the \"Interplanetary Phenomenon Unit\"? // only the key persons would consent to come forward with the answers to those questions! CHINA UFO RESEARCH By Paul Dong (MUFON Field Investigator) On November 13, 1978, the Peo- ple's Daily on its 6th page internation- al sub-column published a title, UFO- An Unknown \"World Puzzle,\" written by Mr. Heng Yen which was later broadcast on radio. A year later, on September 21, 1979, the Peking Guang Ming Daily published Chou Sing Yem's \"Do Flying Saucers Exist?\" report, and it was announced by the New China News Agency. In the same year, a physics student of Wa-han University in Hupei province named Cha Lok Ping wrote to Aerospace Knowledge Magazine and requested his country- men to launch a study of UFOs. When his letter was published, many readers responded. Their \"China UFO Re- search Organization\" had thus been formed with hundreds of members in over 26 provinces and major cities. They also issued a hand written bi- monthly magazine named UFO Re- search. UFO research had begun but it obtained no support from the government. In early 1980,1 joined China UFO research and supported the \"UFO lovers.\" I had written many UFO arti- cles and published in magazines to help the people in China understand more about UFOs. Now the China UFO Research Organization (CURO) has become official and as a unit under the China Academy of Social Sciences. This news was announced to the world by the New China News Agency on December 4,1980. One of the Peking editors of As- tromomy Monthly had said to me: \"Your articles really helped.\" I am a consultant of CURO. For those Americans who wish to help these New China UFO studies, please contact me at P. 0. Box 2011, Oak- land, CA 94604. CURO mostly needs UFO photos. China will also have its first The Journal of UFO Research magazine which will come out on March 1, 1981. For those who wish to publish their UFO articles, data, or advertising please write to me. In its first issue is STAN FRIEDMAN TO DEBATE Fireworks are anticipated when Stanton T. Friedman meets in a for- mal debate with Philip Klass at Trinity University, 715 Stadium, San Antonio, .Texas, on Sunday, February 22, 1981, at 7:30 p.m. in Laurie Auditorium. This debate was arranged by Dr. Michael Hart, a Trinity University astronomer, who hosted the University of Maryland extraterrestrial life con- ference titled \"Where Are They?\" Considering the fact that Dr. Hart is a UFO skeptic, he is to be commended for setting up this significant debate, since it will give the San Antonio area residents an opportunity to be ex- posed to the leading professional UFO lecturer versus a man whose major \"claim to fame\" in UFOlogy has been as a debunker. (Both Stan and Phil receive copies of The MUFON UFO Journal.) About 3 years ago, Mr. Friedman lectured at St. Marys University in San Antonio. Both MUFON head- quarters in Seguin and MUFON of San Antonio will be cooperating with Ms. Lisa Burrows and Dr. Hart of Trinity University in publicizing this splendid event. We look forward to visiting again with Phil Klass and mak- ing him welcome to south Texas. FUND FOR UFO RESEARCH The Fund for UFO Research (Box 277, Mt.

The percipient is a Baptist minister, Rev. Harrison E. Bailey, who is well- known to me and respected in his community. I have, since 1975, been investigating and documenting his re- port of an encounter and abduction by two UFOnauts in an Illinois woods, on September 24,1951. Rev. Bailey's original UFO ex- perience is lengthy and highly detailed and for that reason cannot be covered in this column. Some of the facts re- garding it have been published in FATE Magazine 1 and precise descrip- tions of the prolonged investigation, with accompanying documentation, have been sent to MUFON, to CUFOS, and to selected researchers nationwide and in Europe 7- We refer here, however, to a re- cent incident involving two UFO en- tities, apparently two of the same type creatures who engineered Bailey's abduction 29 years ago. On November 1,-1978, according to Rev. Bailey's recorded statements, he was awakened from a sound sleep by the two creatures, who first appear- ed as disembodied heads against the window shade of his studio apartment. The heads were human-sized, dark brown in color and had distorted fea- tures. Normally, the sight of such an apparition would frighten any witness out of his skin. However, particular circumstances preceded this\" startling incident. These will be explained here in order that the reader can better un- derstand Bailey's subsequent, reasoned actions. As early as 1965, Bailey experi- enced vivid \"dreams\" in which he saw and talked with the two entities he had encountered in 1951. He did not, however, connect these \"dreams\" with his 1951 UFO adventure until after his two hypnotic regression sessions, held with Dr. W. C. McCall on May 18, 1977, and September 28, 1977. Dur- ing these sessions, fuller memories about the encounter and abduction were disclosed. In October 1977 Bailey began to have severe financial worries, due to the fact that his government disability pension was abruptly cut off. The \"dreams\" about the two entities, which heretofore had occurred only occasionally, began to recur with alarming regularity and were usually accompanied by sleepwalking epi- sodes. Many night he walked for miles all over Pasadena and surrounding communities and often times was re- turned to his home by sympathetic police. The sleepwalking episodes invariably occurred between 11:00 p.m. and 1:00 a.m. During these \"dreams\" the en- tities reiterated their original 1951 message. They demanded that he in- form the U.S. government and the American populace about UFOs â€” that they were friendly toward the human race and wished to land un- hindered. Nagged by their repeated inquiries, Bailey began to argue with the entities during the \"dream\" epi- sodes, protesting that they should contact persons with more influence, preferably scientists. When I discussed these \"dreams\" with Bailey in the spring of 1978, he stated they were so vivid that they actually seemed real. I suggested he buy or borrow a camera and try to photograph his \"visitors\" when they appeared next. In this way he could determine whether or not the dreams were reality. On January 8, 1979, Bailey told me about his November 1, 1978, en- counter with the creatures and added that he had successfully photographed them! The 2-month delay in informing me was caused, he stated, by the fact that the experience had been so upset- ting to him that he had not been sure just what to do. As I heard his full ac- count and viewed the 12 photos he had taken, I could understand his re- luctance. The Episode On November 1, 1978, Bailey re- counted, he suddenly awoke at 1:00 a.m. to see two brownish, disembodied heads against a bare window shade at the foot of his bed. They were illumi- nated faintly by the glow of a 40-watt bulb which he customarily kept burn- ing in his bathroom. He lay still for about two or three minutes hoping it was his imagination or perhaps the re- sult of medication which a doctor had prescribed for sleepwalking. His head hurt and his eyes burned. He went into the adjacent bathroom and washed his face. As he returned to bed, the faces were still framed in the window shade. Frightened, Bailey turned on all the lights in his small studio apart- ment, about 400 watts total. The entities spoke with him about one half hour, repeating their message and dictating a long, complicated statement which they demanded he write down. Twice during this time he asked them if he could take their pic- tures with a One-Step Polaroid camera which he had purchased a couple of months before and which he kept near his bed. It is important to note that, although the camera had a built-in (Continued on next page) 9"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"(Entity Photos, continued) flash mechanism, Bailey apparently did not realize this and to the best of his memory none of the necessary flash bars were in the original box. The entities finally consented for Bailey to photograph them, saying that they must first \"de-energize.\" Bailey did not know what they meant, nor had any notion of how long it would take them to accomplish \"de- energizing.\" He waited about a minute and then took two photos of the heads. Then the entities asked him for something \"to get behind.\" Two Hallowe'en masks were lying on Bailey's bookcase. He had planned to attend a Hallowe'en party that evening at his church but had been too tired. He lay the two masks on the small table directly under the window shade and continued taking pictures. During the entire photographic session, which Bailey estimated lasted about 7 minutes, the light on his floor lamp dimmed and flickered on and off, but he cannot relate the times of flickering to any particular photo. As he photographed the masks, which now stood upright on the table against the window shade, he noticed that gray-white appendages had ap- peared, dangling out from the bottom of the masks. Their texture and color were like \"light gray eggs,\" and they took the form of thin, misshapen legs and feet and a miniscule torso. The heads of the entities now seemed hid- den behind the masks; the eye holes were black instead of empty. (See photo.) Although frightened, Bailey was also enthralled. He took five photos of this aspect of the phenomenon. Sud- denly one of the entities jumped from the table and sprang through the open bathroom door. Bailey managed to snap a photo as the creature was framed in the doorway, apparently beginning a spring upward. Bailey followed the creature, but by the time he reached the open doorway the en- tity had disappeared. In the bathroom, Bailey saw whirling globes of colored light near the ceiling, and other dim- mer balls of light were floating nearer the floor. Bailey accidentally brushed 10 7 r The Hallowe'en Masks (Â©1979 by Harrison E. Bailey) ** P. ,.. o Purported Entity Photo (Â©1979 by Harrison E. Bailey)"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"against one of these. It brightened and whirled, and almost instantaneously there were four globes of yellowish bright light whirling around in a circle. Each individual globe was a few inches in diameter. Bailey photograph- ed these before they shot out of sight through the ceiling. The ceiling at this instant seemed to disappear and Bailey had a heady feeling that he was look- ing out into space. This inexplicable happening dull- ed Bailey's reactions. Back out in the living room he saw the second entity jump from the table, starting an up- ward spring. He photographed it as it hurried through the doorway (See photo.) He took another picture as a second group of swirling lights stayed long enough for him to aim his camera. They then disappeared through the ceiling as the first group had done. The phenomenon seemed com- pleted, but Bailey took at least one other photo in the bathroom in hopes of catching some unexpected occur- rence. He was left bewildered and ex- alted, but does not remember return- ing to bed. The next morning when he awoke, he remembered that he had had another \"dream\" about the entities. He rose and was amazed to see his handwritten pages and the 12 Polaroid photos scattered near his bed. Perusing the pictures, he realized that the \"dream\" had been real, but the pictures were as strange as the oc- currence itself. They were not like any pictures Bailey had ever seen. Some were completely dark, others had dim images accompanied by panels of brilliant orangish light, others show- ed clearer, but shadowed shapes. The strangest of all were the photos of the Hallowe'en masks with their staring black eyes and gray-white \"limbs\". These pictures were in full light; the colors were bright and true. This series of five also showed dim yellow globes of light which, in successive shots, made apparent movement from the window shade into the bathroom. Bailey was astounded. He did not know what to make of the pictures. He put them in a safety deposit box at his bank until he could figure out what was best to do. He developed a fear of the apartment, especially at night, and spent the next few weeks at the home of a friend. Follow-Up When I saw the pictures 2 months later, I realized the incongruities and questions they posed. My husband Charles and myself took three dozen comparison photos both with Bailey's camera without flash and with our own Konica with flash. None of Bailey's photos could be duplicated with his Polaroid under the lighting conditions he stated were available to him. The only photos we were able to duplicate, even partially, were the full light pictures of the masks, but this had to be done with flash equipment and our own Konica. Of course, the dangling limbs could not be replicated. We could not think of any material, or combination of materials which could replicate the peculiar, flexible texture depicted by the white ap- pendages. Bailey stated that the whitish material, whatever it was, was not in the apartment when the creatures appeared, neither was it left behind at their departure. We decided to leave this, and other phases of re-- plication, to others more expert than ourselves. There are, of course, several para- normal implications in Rev. Bailey's photos, as follows: 1. The difference in lighting of the 12 photos suggests that the light source varied considerably, from under 200 watts to over 1000 watts. Shad- ows in the \"full-light\" photos also show that the unexplained light source moved from left to right behind Bai- ley. 2. On at least two of the shadow- ed pictures, part of the overall image seemed double-exposed or otherwise perfectly duplicated, while other areas in the same pictures were single- imaged and both clear and fuzzy. 3. The \"appendages\" of the en- tities suggest that the creatures \"fash- ioned\" their own humanoid shapes. Ectoplasm, as described in psychic research literature, is typically whitish or grayish-white, and in some mani- festations (photographed) appears quite dense and of a flexible texture reminiscent of the \"limbs\" in Bailey's photos. Rev. Bailey, in my considered opinion, is an honest and rational man. In my four years of documenting his 1951 encounter I have never found any discrepancy in his statements, and many facets of his complex account were verifiable at the source. Are we seeking only \"acceptable\" photos to prove the UFO phenome- non? Or dare we venture into the un- known? Can we begin developing ways of analyzing the \"impossible\"? (Next month, the search for a source to analyze Bailey's photos and the startling evidence that these pic- tures depict a real, but paranormal event.) NOTES AND REFERENCES 1.

In 1975, he was found suspended from a tree in Pasadena under circumstances that police found \"highly suspicious\"; he claimed that \"Nazis\" had placed him there. (Pasadena Guardian, Oct. 15, 1975). 2. Various statements about his medical history that he attributes to his doctors alleging several specific illnesses and medical anomalies sup- posedly resulting from alien contact. Many of these claims were explicitly disconfirmed in the medical records, and no evidence was found to support such claims as that his internal organs and his teeth had \"aged\" abnormally. 3. His insistence that the pictures taken in his room were made without flashbulbs, yet they show typical re- flective patterns off of shiny surfaces exactly like those obtained with flash- bulbs. In 1979 Bailey, a self-styled minis- ter, issued a rambling statement pur- porting to contain \"messages for Earth,\" the message content indicat- ing Christian spacemen (just as Adam- ski's spacemen spoke \"cosmic philoso- phy\" and Dan Fry's spacemen spoke technical jargon, reflecting their own beliefs). Medical data on Harrison at the Northwestern University Medical Center dated Nov. 18, 1966, showed that he had \"mild cerebral damage\" (Ann Druffel report, March 13, 1979). It is not widely known that in the 1967 Herb Schirmer abduction case, psychological testing showed a classic brain damage pattern that fit exactly with a pre-existing head injury. (Source: Dr. David R. Saunders, psychologist, former member of the Condon Committee, Colorado UFO Project.) Then there is the hypnosis. Even if we did not know as much about Bailey as we do, the techniques of hypnotic regression used do not in- spire confidence that an objectively real experience is being described. At the precise point where Bailey, under hypnosis, is not recalling an abduction, the hypnotist â€” up to this point asking neutral questions â€” abruptly suggests to the witness that he describe an imaginary abduction. (Ironically, Bailey himself openly ac- knowledges fantasizing because he was asked to do so.) Under hypnosis, Bailey is asked to reconstruct the times of various e- vents. When he is asked to \"look at his watch\" and state the time, he o- bliges. At one point when asked whether he is wearing a watch, he dis- tinctly says, \"no\". At another point, he says, \"I have a watch.\" Later, when asked, \"What time does your watch say now?\" he replies \". . .about 2:30 or 3:00\" . . .and later, \"7tf figure a- bout 5:00 o'clock.\" Here and else- where in the transcripts, it is clear that the witness was repeatedly prompted and was obligingly suggestible. This prompting, especially, casts serious doubt on the entire hypnotically de- rived abduction story â€” Hypnotist: OK. Harrison, I want you to do a little experiment for us. I'm going to ask you to just use your imagination. I want you to imagine that you were taken aboard. . . . (Tape transcript of May 18, 1977, hypnotic session, p. 11) In most respects, Bailey's story and behavior are not typical of the classic 1950's \"contactees.\" Rather, they sug- gest another hypothesis (other than actual abduction or conscious dishon- esty): A mildly brain-damaged, men- tally confused person who wants and probably psychologically needs caring attention, and who may or may not have had a UFO encounter. Under this hypothesis, the disconfirmed medical claims and the dubious photographs can be interpreted as less-th an-con- scious attention-seeking devices to maintain contact with a caring and supportive investigator (a phenomenon familiar to investigators of purported adepts in parapsychology research). UFO investigators continue to un- derestimate the role of human psy- chology, when overpowering emotion- al needs lead people to engage in \"un- conscious fabrication\" in order to get attention and to feel some sense of in- dividual importance.

Scott Rogo (Pren- tice-Hall, 1 Inc., Englewood Cliffs, N.J., 1980,264 p.,$9.95). A tireless ufologist, author of many articles on various aspects of UFO research, here joins forces with, a professional parapsychologist, also a writer, to investigate \"an actual ep- idemic\" of close-encounter cases in a localized area This is a deep and thoughtful study requiring concentra- tion and commanding respect. The complex material is well organized. The Shaw-Whitley incident was the primary case. Sara Shaw and Jan Whitley, while living in an isolated cabin near Los Angeles, were awaken- ed by an oscillating blue light. When it vanished they found 2 hours had passed. Twenty years later, under hyp- nosis, they discovered they had been abducted. A few years after the ab- duction, Jan was living with a new roommate, Emily; the young women were often visited by \"alien pres- ences.\" Friends of Emily â€” Lori and Jo â€” experienced still other encoun- ters. Jan apparently was the source of the \"contagion\", which spread from her and Sara to Emily and then to Lori and Jo. Thus the investigation uncovers more puzzles than solutions. One mys- tery is a \"cancer cure\" that Sara was convinced she had been told about. As the hypnotic regressions are related, with direct quotations from tapes, dif- ferent facets of the abductions and en- counters are skilfully compared with those of other cases. This makes for comprehensive and interesting treat- ment, and allows the reader to follow the thoughts of the researchers. The differing conclusions of the authors are fascinating. I admire their tenacious pursuit of this tangled enig- ma! Ann Druffel gives us her back- ground thinking on UFOs. She re- views the changes in the UFO phe- nomenon, always a little ahead of the investigators, a progression that has given rise to theories about UFOs be- ing a system â€” for control, for expan- sion of consciousness, for carrying on a teaching process, etc. Druffel thinks the next steps will be philosophical and cosmological. To her philosophy means a study of being. Will UFOs teach us about the nature of \"being\"? Between God and man, accord- ing to all monotheistic religions, are spirits, called by many names, among them \"angels\" and \"demons.\" These spirits can materialize temporarily. UFO entities seem to be similar to angels and demons, invisible spirits who are able to fashion bodies at will. In the Tujunga cases there were be- nevolent and malevolent entities, dif- fering in appearance and attitude. â€¢ Another part of the phenomenon is that some abduction reports reflect personal details in the life of the wit- ness. Druffel thinks this \"detail re- flectivity\" can be explained thus: The \"mother ships\" are \"manifesta- tions of UFOs as they really are,\" but the entities inside them are \"balls of energy or light,\" which create their appearance and that of their craft as the witness would expect, psychically taking details from the mind of the witness and projecting them into the encounter. Druffel believes that the entities were attracted to the Tujunga women because they were all interested in metaphysical studies and other mind- expanding activities, and because some were engaged in a gay (non-procrea- tive) life-style. Here Druffel says \"deep inquiry into personal aspects of witnesses' lives is unbecoming and, to an extent, unnecessary. The search for truth can- not justify violation of privacy.\" That is a kind and tactful ethic, but this re- viewer thinks that such inquiry, con- ducted by a qualified psychiatrist, is exactly what is needed. This valuable information is almost always lacking to the researcher, who usually knows little of psychiatry himself. The tricks the subconscious can play on the con- scious mind are obviously evident in many cases, but have seldom been clarified by proper psychiatric evalua- tion. In summary, Druffel thinks UFOs and their occupants, part of God's creation, are superior to man intellec- tually and in not being \"bound by the confines of a material world.\" Rogo, although agreeing with Druffel on many points, comes to a different conclusion. He begins by re- marking that many researchers no longer believe in the \"nuts and bolts\" theory. UFOs are \"partially immateri- al,\" they \"change shape at will,\" \"sometimes seem sensitive to the thoughts of the viewers,\" are \"natu- ral mimics\" and \"bad mimics.\" He notes two important clues to their identification: they are \"partially physical and partly ethereal at the same time\" and (from Keel) \"as our aeronautical technology has improved, UFOs have changed shape according- ly.\" Like Druffel, he sees that \"UFOs are always a step ahead of the re- searchers.\" They are symbiotically linked to our planet, our culture and our minds. A close encounter is often the prelude to a lifelong ordeal of con- tinued alien contact or psychic attack; it can result in \"paranormal fallout\" and \"poltergeist victims.\" Here Rogo, author of \"The Pol- tergeist Experience,\" establishes a connection between UFOs and pol- tergeists. Poltergeists are violent tele- kinetic or psychokinetic displays that occur when a family (or a member) cannot deal with psychological stress. The close association between some UFO sightings and subsequent pol- tergeist activity tends to indicate that these two phenomena have a similar cause. UFOs may be projected at times of psychological stress. Rogo thinks UFOs may come into existence in either of two ways: as the product of a mass psychic ef- fect generated by an entire culture,or through the psychic abilities of an in- dividual mind. His theory amalgamates Jerome Clark's idea that UFO experi- ences are rich in symbolic content and merges it with Vallee's concept of a control system that can work on an individual or a cultural level. The origins of Rogo's theory were develop- ed by Clark in \"Earth's Secret Inhabi- tants\" (with D.S.R.). Rogo adopted Clark's ideas and elaborated on them. These postulated the existence of an intelligence, called X, or The Phenom- enon, that generates the UFO mystery.

Double- day Dolphin, New York, 1980. 440 pp. Cloth $24.95. Paper $12.95. This is a landmark contribution to UFO literature, far and away the best thing we have had for a long time. It assembles more information on UFOs, UFOlogists, and UFOlogy than has ever been made available in a single volume before. To begin with it is a good-looking book. The publishers have given it a handsome cover, suitable to its serious character. The type face is legible, the page format clear and uncluttered. Furthermore, the proofreading is above average for these days; typo- graphical errors are not numerous. The 300-odd entries, from the AAAS symposium to the Zeta Reticuli connection, are rich and varied. They are .divided about equally into sighting cases, biographies of individuals promi- nent in the field of UFOlogy, and topi- cal entries on different aspects of the subject. Almost all the biographies are accompanied by a photograph of the subject and by a position statement, either written by the subject or taken from his or her writings. (Incidentally, the biographies raise a fascinating question: Why are so few women prominent in UFOlogy? There are on- ly a handful of them in the Encyclope- dia, and this is not sex discrimination by the editors. A psychological exami- nation of possible reasons for the over- whelming predominance of men in this field would be of considerable interest.) Except for a few entries presum- ably prepared by the editors, all con- tributions are signed by the writer, there are lavish cross-references, a good many black-and-white photo- graphs relevant to cases, and eight pages of color photographs (including stills from the Great Falls, Montana, and Tremonton, Utah, films). Four appendices add further to the book's interest: A chronology of important political, military, and scientific events in UFO history from 1947 into 1978; a list of UFO magazines, with ad- dresses, by countries; a list of acronyms 14 and abbreviations related to UFOs; and a 14-page bibliography. Reading the Encyclopedia is like wandering through Aladdin's cave. Here are articles on angel's hair, the Condon report, the swamp gas episode; opinion polls, orthoteny, and the Tunguska meterorite. Soviet studies are described, and South American at- titudes toward UFOs. All the famous Projects are here: Blue Book, Saucer, Sign and Grudge, Twinkle, Magnet, Second Storey; CIA and FBI involve- ment. There is an excellent article on UFO shapes, and another on colors. Radar sightings, pilot sightings, and sightings by astronomers are summa- rized. There is a useful listing of all al- leged sightings by astronauts (one does not have to agree with all of James Oberg's opinions as to what the astro- nauts \"probably\" or \"presumably\" saw). The major UFO organizations in the U.S. and abroad are described (no encyclopedist, no matter how diligent, could cover all of the hundreds of groups that have risen and vanished since 1947). Peripheral topics like ani- mal mutilations and the Bermuda Tri- angle are considered (although the al- leged Bigfoot-UFO link does not ap- pear). Theories are well covered; articles include the space animals theory, the extraterrestrial hypothesis, conspiracy theories, the secret weapons theory, ancient astronauts, and propulsion theories. Those who want to examine UFOs from the viewpoint of other dis- ciplines will find articles on their psy- chological, psychiatric, and sociologi- cal aspects. Various effects of UFOs are treated â€” physical traces, E-M ef- fects, physiological effects. Several of the best articles are con- tributed by Consulting Editor J. Rich- ard Greenwell, such as those on the extraterrestrial hypothesis, the Con- don report, and the reliability of UFO witnesses, to name only a few. In the biographies, all shades of opinion are represented, from arch- skeptic Donald Menzel to arch-contac- tee Frank Stranges. The sighting reports are a good cross-section of cases. Al- though each of us might like to see some of our personal favorites also re- presented, all of those included cer- tainly belong he re. Perfection is not for mortals, how- ever, and there are some omissions among this wealth of information. I miss some of the early names in UFO history. I would like to have seen an article on UFOlogy in Japan, and one on skyquakes. But there are cogent reasons for these gaps: the pressures of time and available space under which the editors must have worked, the fact that some invited contributors must have failed to respond, and the scope and complexity of UFOlogy itself in the third of a century since Arnold's sighting. And in the face of what is here, to cavil at the omissions is down- right greedy. Objectivity should be a primary goal in a work like this on a subject as full of controversy as a cactus is of thorns. Even in writing about disputed topics and figures it is possible to let the facts speak for themselves (as Story has done in his biographies of Daniel Fry and Howard Menger, for example). Unfortunately, the editors have not been entirely successful in elimi- nating bias. I do not know how much of this is their fault. But it does seem strange that the entry on ball lightning should have been assigned a writer who subscribes fully to the plasma theory of the nature of UFOs. Some- times prejudice bursts out in polemics. Kevin Randle ends his article on hid- den bodies in crashed saucers' as fol- lows: \" ... the story is Scully's, dug up and fed to UFO buffs who want to be- lieve.\" This is intemperate language and has no place in a reference work. The same angry note occurs at the end of Randle's article on the Allende let- ters. He seems to feel that the reader will be taken in by the story if he, Randle, does not cram his own judg- ment down the reader's throat. A more serious form of bias, be- cause less obvious, is the omission or minimizing of relevant facts about a topic or case. The treatment of the Heflin photograph is far from even- handed. No mention is made of Heflin's widespread reputation for integrity - surely a relevant datum. The pictures are labeled inconclusive by APRO, and hoaxes by Blue Book and by Sheaffer (Continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"(Encyclopedia, continued) in his postscript, citing the evaluation by Ground Saucer Watch. He does not seem to be aware that GSW's methods of evaluation have themselves been crit- icized. Some indication should have been given of this disagreement about the case.

Stringfield is a serious researcher of long experience, and to ignore his work entirely is â€” no matter how contemptuously Randle personally views the hidden bodies story â€” to give a distorted picture. Not all the bias is exhibited by skeptics. When Robert Ellsworth, Jr., describes George Van Tassel as \"an American individualist of strong char- acter in the classic mold of the wea- thered pioneer ..,\" one feels that he is' treating that gentleman with more ten- derness than Van Tassel's record de- serves; and Ellsworth's long article on Orfeo Angelucci is almost reverent. Fortunately, the position state- ment appearing with each biography enables the reader to determine whe- ther the author of a given article is like- ly to be writing lop-sidedly. These criticisms do not change my opinion that the Encyclopedia is a fas- cinating, useful, and unique addition to the UFOlogy bookshelf, and that we owe the editors congratulations for their remarkable achievement. It will not be surpassed until its own second edition. (Tujunga, continued) X beams projections into our world; it knows our minds and provides us with \"visions\" that have certain phys- ical qualities. Applying these ideas to the ab- duction syndrome, Rogo believes that a contact, probably psychic in nature, can be made under certain conditions between The Phenomenon and an in- dividual mind. These UFO dramas would be highly personalized in na- ture, since the mind of the witness is acting as a channel through which the event is occurring. Abductions really do occur, but are produced jointly by the mind of the witness and the materializing ability of X. Abductions happen when the victim is in a state of psychological need, and when the unconscious mind needs to impart an important message to the conscious mind. X relies on a prototypical experience which it then molds individually to best communicate a vital message in symbolic form to the witness, a pro- cess similar to dreaming. X extracts the conflict from the witness's mind and projects it back to him in objec- tified form. Rogo also suggests that The Phenomenon might use an alternate modus operandi. It might not always materialize the abduction drama into three-dimensional space, but may on occasion directly imprint it on the mind(s) of the witness (es) through some mechanism akin to telepathy. This is illustrated by one of the Tu- junga Canyon cases. Clark and Coleman say the sym- bols in the abduction dramas are ba- sically archetypal in nature. Rogo, however, thinks the abduction is some- times structured around individual symbols in the witness's mind. He ap- plies this theory to the Hill case, pro- ducing an interpretation that is novel but makes sense. He then applies the theory to the Sara Shaw-Jan Whitley case, again with most interesting re- sults. In summary, Rogo says he has not solved the Shaw-Whitley case, but has explained its many aspects, including why it happened. He maintains that his theory \"demonstrates that the UFO mystery cannot be divorced from the mind or the culture that perceives it.\" \"Some Personal Conclusions\" by Saia Shaw follow. In this chapter the witness states that almost all the theories presented by the investigators are possibilities. To her the experience as relived through hypnosis was very real, but she does not know its mean- ing. In the Appendix there is a com- parison between the Sara Shaw and the Betty Andreasson cases, stressing the common features. These are events the witnesses say happened to them, Letters Comments On \"Hangar 18\" Editor, After reading Barbara Mathey's movie review on \"Hangar 18\" .(MUFON UFO Journal, Sept. 80), I find that I have some behind-the- scenes information to her question of whether or not the story is based on a true incident or a combination of cases. Back in March 1977. the produc- tion managers of Sunn Classic Pictures contacted a number of selected UFO researchers around the country to do research on various UFO related top- ics, mainly where, if it exists, is the military holding UFO hardware, and who has the inside facts about what has been going on. UFO researcher Leonard String- field, I, and several others were asked to sign a contract to do exclusive re- search on those questions for Sunn so they could produce a nonfiction film based on the facts showing how the military has captured a UFO and kept this information from the public. I, for one, signed the UFO Consulting Agreement and supplied Sunn with various UFO crash information from my files. Then something went wrong. The original production crew bailed out of the project and according to my con- tact at Sunn, another film company was going to make the movie. (Scotia Films, New York - - Ed.) Rumors floated that a government agency had impressed upon Sunn Classic it would be in their best interest not to produce (Continued on page 17) such as \"floating\" and mind control. It is not a psychological comparison of the abductees themselves, which might be revealing. The book also includes photos, drawings by the witnesses, a map of the Tujunga Canyon area, and an in- dex. It is not a simple book. The in- terwoven complexities of the related cases are, as Ann Druffel says, almost overwhelming. Nevertheless it is high- ly recommended, both for the clear reporting of the unusual and unclear material and the careful reasoning of the authors. - Barbara Mathey 15"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"MUFON STATE DIRECTORS We are publishing this list, and will up- date it periodically, in order to encourage cooperation and coordination not only a- mong the various elements of MUFON, but also with other groups.

Then in 1980, \"Hangar 18\" is re- leased. Some of the events described in the film closely resemble some of the data that I gave Sunn Classic 3 years ago. After a number of frust- rating calls to them to get to the bot- tom of this matter, their research de- partment told me none of the UFO data they paid for back in,1977 was used in the making of this picture. They started with fresh material and this film is supposedly pure fiction from beginning to end. Or is it? T.Scott Grain, Jr. Fort Matilda, Pa. Editor's reply: Sunn Classics also con- tacted me, Walt Andrus, Larry Bryant, and others at various stages of re- searching a UFO movie. Originally it was to be a general documentary. At that stage, 1 signed a contract and pro- vided material on a number of CE-II â€¢cases. Gradually, Sunn Classics saw \"sensation\" value in the \"crashed sau- cer\" stories and focused on them. Meanwhile, Scotia American Produc- tions, New York, was working on a rival documentary (with Todd Zechel as research director). I did consider- able research in the National Archives for Scotia. Later, Scotia also began seeking \"sensation,\" and Sunn Classics negotiated with them to take over the film altogether. I do not know the ex- act deal that was struck, but do know that Scotia acquired the Sunn Classics research files. The Scotia film, also tending toward fiction last I knew, never was completed.

As with all such reports (especial- ly those involving hypnotic regres- sions), one never knows how much can be accepted as fact. The book's au- thor, Frank Johnson, seems convinced that the account is valid. It is certainly a fascinating story, with a great deal of information about the supposed planet Janos. With reports as detailed as this one, a point is reached where one must consider which is more fan- tastic, a literal interpretation of the story or the hypothesis that it is all a product of subconscious fabrications.

Blann, Lewisville, Texas, submitted a xeroxed copy of a NASA publication titled \"Field Res- onance Propulsion Concept\" by Alan C. Holt to MUFON, which he felt may be of interest to some of our Journal readers who are interested in UFO propulsion methods. It is an unclassi- fied pamphlet dated August 1979 pub- lished by NASA, Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center, in Houston, Texas. The number' of the publication is JSC- 16073. Mr. Holt is a member of MUFON, VISIT, and served as the moderator for the Workshop on Ad- vanced Propulsion at the 1980 MUFON UFO Symposium in Clear Lake City, Texas. The abstract pro- vides a clue to the contents of this 13-page report: A new \"propulsion\" concept has been developed based on a proposed reso- nance between coherent, pulsed elec- tromagnetic wave forms and gravita- tional wave forms (or space-time met- rics). Using this concept a spacecraft \"propulsion\" system potentially cap- able of galactic and inter-galactic travel without prohibitive \"travel times\" has been designed. The \"pro- pulsion\" system utilizes recent research associated with magnetic field line merging, hydromagnetic wave effects, free-election lasers, laser generation of megagauss fields, and special structural and containment metals. Research re- quired to determine potential, field resonance characteristics and to eval- uate various aspects of the spacecraft \"propulsion\" design is described.

Dennis Stacy, MUFON Director of Publications, recently had a five- part series of articles published in the San Antonio News starting on Nov- ember 23 and concluding on Novem- ber 27, 1980, under copyrighted title \"Texas Strange,\" which he hopes to syndicate.

Some of the investigations into this case seem highly question- able, at best. The December 16 issue of THE STAR reports on China's growing in- terest in UFOs. A special commission has been set up by the Chinese govern- ment to investigate about 100 sight- ings in that country. Dr. J. Allen Hy- nek has accepted an invitation to visit China and confer with the researchers studying the subject. One of the most fascinating \"con- tactee\" stories of the post-1947 period is the tale of Samuel Eaton Thompson. Until now, Thompson's claims have been virtually unknown, but Jerome Clark summarizes them in the January issue of FATE. Kenneth Arnold inter- viewed Thompson on two occasions and the tapes of those interviews form the basis for Clark's article. There are numerous parallels with later \"Venus- ian\" stories by Adamski, Menger, and others, but Thompson seems to have been the first to describe this particu- lar type of UFO being. Clark's article should be read for the data, rather than his conclusions and speculations, but it is well worth your attention.

A British family of three adults and two sniall children were al- legedly taken on board a large space- ship in June 1978.
