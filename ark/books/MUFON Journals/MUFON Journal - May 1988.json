A quick glance at the cover will now tell you what waits inside each month. In addition, each page is identified as to month, issue and year. If you have to make copies of articles for research or per- sonal reasons, this will make your job easier. Artwork and pho- tographs will continue to appear on the cover from time to time, but with far less frequency than in the past, as is standard scien- tific journal practice. For all practical purposes, the Journal's format is now final- ized. Changes were not made arbitrarily, but with an eye to mak- ing the Journal easier to read and use. A different layout, how- ever, would mean little in itself, unless it reflected an improvement in the quality of material inside. We think you will agree that this happens to be the case. And we appreciate your support. Gulf Breeze Note: Instead of the Nimslo photographs mentioned in the article, which would not have reproduced well, we have used instead a sketch by \"Mr. Ed\" which originally appeared in the Gulf Breeze Sentinel. Having viewed blow-ups of those pictures, however, we can say that the light patterns pho- tographed do indeed seem to parallel Mr. Ed's sketch. APRO 1952 -1988 A letter from Robert G. Mars- land, Deputy Director for APRO, dated March 29, 1988 and address- ed to \"Dear Friends\" stated the fol- lowing: \"It is with deepest regret that I tell you that there will be no more issues of the APRO Bulletin. Mrs. Lorenzen has been through- some very trying times, both phys- ically and emotionally, no doubt hastened by the death of her daughter last month. Now her doctor advises that for her own welfare, she must not take on any more of the burdens imposed in running this organization. And since there is no one else with the editorial skills and endless font of memory to do the job, I must attend the last rites.\" On April 12, 1988, Coral E. Lorenzen (age 63) died in a Tucson hospital. She was preceded in death by her husband, Leslie James and daughter Lesli Stryker. Funeral services were held April 18, 1988 under the direction of the Adair Fun- eral Home at the Unitarian Universalist Church in Tucson, Arizona. Inurnment will be in Arlington National Cemetery with her husband. Thus ... another era passes into UFO history.

Strand INTRODUCTION French-born Jacques Vallee, bilin- gual in both computers and astro- physics, is ufology's both most reknown- ed and reclusive figure. Certainly he is the most controversial thinker in a field fraught with philosophical pitfalls, having served as the model for Lacombe\\ (played with suave dignity by the late Francois Truffaut) in Steven Spielberg's \"Close Encounters of the Third Kind.\" At the time Vallee objected strenuously to the portrayal of alien beings as benign \"brothejrs\" from another world, an argument that not unexpectedly succumbed to Hol- lywood's boxoffice sensibilities. He once said of the cinematic Lacombe, \"I think they were simply looking for a character at a level of strangeness halfway between the main American characters and the space people.\" Interestingly, Dan Ackroyd's extrater- restrial nuclear family, the former \"Saturday Night Live\" Coneheads, also said they were from France when pressed about their origins. With the late Dr. J. Allen Hynek, Vallee helped found an \"invisible col- lege\" of UFO experts (the title of one of his own books on the subject) and co-authored The Edge of Reality. Val- lee's early studies (Anatomy of a Phenomenon and Chaflenge to Science, written with wife Janine) were char- acterized by a concise phenomeno- logical approach to the UFO data. But with Passport to Magonia (1969) and particularly Messengers of Decep- tion (1979) the lanky, soft-spoken Val- lee left many of his American follow- ers confused if not openly skeptical. Magonia, which compared contem- porary accounts of aliens and abduc- tions with precedents found mostly in medieval European folklore was well- received on the continent. Indeed, a movement based on psycho-sociologi- cal interpretations of UFO pheno- mena sprang up in its wake, pro- moted largely by fellow Frenchmen. MUFON UFO Journal, No. 241 May 1988 Â«; My mind works best by soaking up data like a sponge and squeezing it every once in a while.\" In England it even led to the estab- lishment of a quarterly journal by the same name. Messengers, however, with its emphasis on mostly west coast American UFO cults, was a somewhat unfocused work that even Vallee himself admits \"I would do dif- ferently now.\" After Messengers Vallee published three books about technology, includ- ing a textbook on computer network- ing. But he went underground as far as the American UFO community was largely concerned. Aside from the public demands on his time (unavoidably, a personality cult had formed around his own writings), Val- lee had learned that he did his best thinking in a vacuum, free from the \"contamination of popular theories about UFOs, maintaining a circle of silence around me, and conducting my own investigations in the field.\" More to the point, he says, \"my mind works best by soaking up data like a sponge and squeezing it every once in a while.\" Vallee's latest squeeze is a book that summarizes and clarifies his ear- lier works. It is called Dimensions: A Casebook of Alien Contact (Con- temporary Books, Chicago, $17.95). In it he expands on the concept first proposed in Invisible College, com- paring UFOs to a control system operating on our collective uncons- cious. Both in their folklore and mod- ern forms, says Vallee, \"UFOs are the means through which man's con- cepts are being arranged.\" While working on the manuscript of Dimensions, Vallee gradually emerg- ed from his self-imposed silence. In 1986 he published a novel in French entitled ALINTEL, which is thought to contain facts and speculations he could not publish in non-fiction form. December a year ago he addressed a UFO conclave in London, and late last year he turned up as one of the speakers at a San Francisco New Age symposium on \"Angels, Aliens and Archetypes: Cosmic Intelligence and the Mythic Imagination,\" spon- sored by the Omega Foundation. Linda Strand is a freelance journal- ist living in Boulder, Colorado, who specializes in scientific subjects. Her articles on a wide variety of topics have appeared in Science Digesr, Astronomy and similar publications. \"I first heard the name Jacques Val- lee in 1977,\" Strand says, \"as my interest in the area of UFO research was just getting started. Two pf my most trusted friends in such matters strongly recommended that I try to contact him, saying his work was 'far and away the best' in the field. Five years later, having been thoroughly disillusioned by most of the UFO research I had studied, I finally wrote to Vallee in care of his publisher. \"When we met some six months later over dinner, I was constantly amused by the similarities between Vallee and the character played by Francois Truffaut in 'Close Encoun- ters of the Third Kind'. When I pointed this out, he smiled and said in a strong French accent, 'that's not coincidence'. \"What has continued to impress me most about Vallee is his humility: He never gives the impression of being the guru with all the answers. It is so refreshing to relate to a 'true scientist,' unashamed of having more questions than answers, still trying to understand and to keep his precon- ceptions out of the way of creative thought. I think his intelligence and wit shine through in the following interview, which we began late last year.\" The Journal wishes to thank both 3"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Ms. Strand and Mr. Vallee for the exclusive interview that follows. Strand: Jacques Vallee, in recent years you have been \"in retreat\" as far as UFOs are concerned. Are you simply becoming reclusive, or have you given up UFO research? Vallee: The only thing that interests me is getting closer to a solution of the UFO problem. The controversies that are currently being played out on the stage of the UFO community in the U.S. seem largely irrelevant to that goal. But I haven't disappeared from the field: two research trips to South America, lectures last year in Lon- don, and several visits to researchers in Europe, including a briefing of the top-level, scientific community of GEPAN in France ... I would hardly call that \"reclusive.\" Strand: Yet you have not published anything in book form since Mes- sengers of Deception in 1979. Are you working on anything new? Vallee: I am finishing a new book called Dimensions, which will be pub- lished in the Spring of 1988 in hard cover by Contemporary Books of Chicago. I believe it will answer many of the questions people have asked about my position. Strand: Are you planning to include in that book the cases you have been investigating recently? Vallee: No, I have not found the right format yet to publish these cases. Many of them need more work. I do plan to make the informa- tion available, but I want to do it in a format that is constructive. Strand: Why do you find it neces- sary to operate in this rather secre- tive manner? Vallee: Let's call it \"private\" rather than \"secretive.\" It is natural for a researcher to stay a few years ahead of what he publishes. I go through phases of quiet work and phases of active dissemination and discussion. Currently what we lack most of all is not data: Heaven knows we've got more data than we know what to do with! What we lack is a framework, and that's what I have tried to con- struct in Dimensions, using both old material drawn from my earlier works and new observations. Strand: How do you get information? 4 The field has been very quiet for sev- eral years now. Vallee: It is true that we have not had a major \"wave\" in the Western countries for a long time. Also, peo- ple do not report their sightings to the press or the authorities as they did before; they now understand that such reports are, unfortunately, point- less. But I do get quite a few reports directly from the witnesses or through my friends in the field. Since I am able to run my own research, I don't have to wait for a grant or ask anyb- ody's permission to pursue a case. And I have free or nearly free access to all the technology I need. Strand: We will come back to this subject later, but first, can you sum- marize your educational background? Vallee: I grew up in France wanting to become an astronomer. That meant studying at the Sorbonne, taking math and physics, then a graduate program. Those were the early days of computers, which I found terribly exciting, so I took information science and programming courses as part of my master's degree in astrophysics. Then I worked at Paris observatory for a year under the French Govern- ment's Space Committee. When I came to the University of Texas in 1962 I used this background. I wrote the program that computed the map of Mars for the Mariner project âthe first detailed map of the planet, under NASA sponsorship. Later I moved to Northwestern, and I did my Ph.D. in 1967 on a topic that would be called artificial intelligence today. In those days it was regarded as applied mathematics! Strand: How did your relationship with Hynek start? Vallee: He knew that my wife and I had compiled and analyzed the first computer catalog of world-wide, unex- plained UFO sightings. He urged me to work with him, and he generously made his own data available. I stayed at Northwestern from 1963 to 1967. Strand: Why did you change your emphasis from astronomy to informa- tion science? Many UFO researchers have considered astronomy the most useful training to investigate UFOs. Vallee: A good background in astron- omy is essential to sort out genuine sightings from common celestial ob- jects. It is also very useful in order to de-mystify the statements of close- minded scientists who like to pontifi- cate as if they understood the whole of the universe. The study of astron- omy should make us humble and cur- ious about all the things we don't know, including UFOs. However it doesn't really work that way. I found the computer field much more open and dynamic. My information science teachers actually encouraged me to pursue my UFO work. Strand: The years you spent with Allen Hynek at Northwestern seem to have been a turning point for both of you and, as a result of the later work you both did, a turning point for U.S. Ufology as well. How did this transformation take place? Vallee: For me, it was very simple: for the first time I had access to the totality of the Blue Book files and I could vastly expand the analyses I had done before, while getting an insight into the entire history of the field and meeting the key players. For Allen Hynek, the change was dif- ferent. He was a very open-minded scientist, who had thought long and deeply about the limitations of science, but he had to walk a tight rope when it came to UFOs. On one hand, he knew that many Air Force explana- tions were \"pure hogwash\", as he liked to say. On the other hand, he had never found convincing scientific evidence for the existence of UFOs, so he remained skeptical. Strand: What is it that changed his position? Vallee: This happened slowly, over a period of weeks, months, as he saw the accumulated evidence from my files of landing reports, and the corre- lations that were established with sim- ilar data from the American files. Strand: He must have been aware of these landing reports. Vallee: They were circulated in Amer- ica among marginal groups, but they were mixed in with all the \"hogwash.\" You must realize that those landings which were reported to the Air Force were generally placed in the \"psycho- logical\" category, and Hynek was rarely asked to follow them up. The leading civilian group was NICAP, which was trying to gain credibility in' Washington, and they suppressed these reports too. The only group that understood the significance of MUFON UFO Journal, No. 241 May 1988"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"the landing reports from the begin- ning was APRO. In France, on the other hand, we had hundreds of well- documented close encounter cases since the major wave of 1954. Strand: What did he think of those cases? Vallee: He was certainly aware of them. He had met in Paris with Aime Michel and Pierre Guerin at the sug- gestion of a leading French astrono- mer who had moved to the United States. He came back from Paris very intrigued with the data and impressed with Michel and Guerin but he remained unconvinced until I showed him the details and the actual patterns. He told me, \"those reports sounded like ghost stories to me.\" He was especially struck by Aime Michel's description of the 1954 wave as \"a festival of absurdities.\" Strand: What made him change his mind? Vallee: A key factor was a running argument we had for several weeks about what constitutes proof that the phenomenon exists. I took the posi- tion that a single report means nothing in itself, but that hundreds of reports fitting into a global pattern indicated a genuine phenomenon. The clincher for him, of course, was the fact that the same pattern started to emerge from the Air Force data. At that point Allen Hynek decided the time had come to advocate serious research into the phenomenon. Strand: The history of that period usually claims that Hynek did not change his position until Jim McDo- nald came into his office and banged on his desk. Vallee: That is simply not true. I was there, by the way, when Jim banged on the desk. A long time before that particular scene Hynek had agreed to sponsor severa) proposals I wanted to submit to the Air Force, but they were reluctant to do anything, and so was Northwestern University. Hynek went on with the fight quietly, behind the scenes, as was his style. McDonald's approach was vocal and direct; he took the controversy to the public arena prematurely, in my opinion. And he suffered the consequences. McDonald's highly visible action pre- cipitated the Condon Committee. Strand: It sounds like it was an excit- ing period, with a powerful sense of MUFON UFO Journal, No. 241 May 1988 \"Should we let engineers, artists and college pro- fessors untrained in clinical hypnosis mess with the minds of impressionable witnesses? Emphatically no. discovery in the air. Vallee: It did not happen overnight. It took me four years to go through the totality of the Blue Book files, twelve thousand cases. And most of them, of course, could be explained by natural phenomena. I still have today the only complete, screened and abstracted set of unexplained cases from the Air Force files. Not just the few cases they labeled \"uni- dentified\", but the large number of those for which there was really no adequate explanation. It was that residue that was valua- ble. Allen compared the process to looking for a few grams of radium in tons of pitchblend. He encouraged me to bring other scientists into our group. Fred Beckman joined us, from the University of Chicago, and Bill Powers, the chief engineer at Dear- born Observatory, as well as several mathematicians, engineers and psy- chologists. We re-investigated many of the cases which the Air Force had pushed under the rug. Strand: Why do histories of the UFO problem gloss over that period, which was a key transition point? Vallee: I can't answer that question. Perhaps they tend to concentrate on the \"official\" side of things, the Con- gressional Hearings, the McDonald controversy that made a big splash with the media. The really important things occurred behind the scenes, and it may be a long time before somebody realizes that the true his- tory of the phenomenon has not been revealed, because many of the partic- ipants kept a low profile. You're the first person who has asked me ques- tions about that period. Strand: What do you think is missing from the historical analyses? Vallee: Two things: a sense of the slowly-changing positions of the key researchers rather than the big, sen- sational events; and the international perspective. American historians of the field have looked exclusively at the U.S. scene, probably because they had to define the subject narrow- ly to keep it manageable. But it was always apparent to us from the beginning that the problem could only be tackled at an international level. Strand: Give me some examples of that. Vallee: Just look at the foreign indi- viduals and organizations that have had a major impact. People like Olavo Fontes in Brazil, or the British 'Flying Saucer Review in London. No U.S. magazine has ever compared with it, although a lot of money has been squandered on flashy publica- tions that disappeared quickly. Right now I am working on three cases, one a physical evidence analysis, the second a photograph of a UFO, and the third one an abduction. Only the latter one comes from the United States. Strand: Obviously you think there is something wrong with U.S. research into UFOs. What is it? A parochial attitude? Vallee: Too much talk and not enough research. Strand: Is that why you don't belong to any UFO organization at the moment? Vallee: You don't need to belong to a UFO organization to do UFO research any more than you need to join a wine appreciation club to enjoy a good bottle. I believe that in the future you will find as much research being done outside the organized groups as you will inside. There is room for many approaches to this problem, and there is a continuing need for some strong, structured groups. But if the main activity is tell- ing scary stories and speculating end- lessly about what the government may be hiding, I am not interested. Strand: What do you think of the unexpectedly immense popular accep- tance of both Whitley Strieber's Com- munion and Budd Hopkins' Intruders? Vallee: There are several lessons to be drawn from their success. First it shows to what extent the media and many people in official positions had misjudged the depth of the phenome-"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"\"MJ-12 could very well have existed, but its objec- tives might be other than what the UFO commun- ity thinks.\" non. Both of these books came out at a time when very few \"sightings\" were being reported, yet the tension of personal experiences with the phenomenon was reaching a peak among the public. But the UFO community can be surprised, too: six months prior to the publication of these books, a novel by John Fowles entitled A Maggot was an interna- tional bestseller. Interestingly it passed completely unnoticed by UFO research- ers. Here you had one of the greatest living writers in the English language publishing a masterpiece dealing entire- ly with the problem of alien contact, and our community ignored it com- pletely! A Maggot is the most fasci- nating book I've read in the last ten years. Strand: What are your feelings about the rampant use of regressive hypno- sis in abduction investigations? Vallee: I am repelled by the way hypnosis is being used by many UFO researchers today. It is not simply misguided, it is irresponsible, unscien- tific and profoundly unethical. Does hypnosis have a place in the arsenal of the investigator? Yes, when it is performed by a professional psychia- trist with clinical experience in hyp- nosis and no personal bias with regard to UFOs, or by clinical psy- chologists. What makes the Hill case so significant is the fact that the ses- sions were conducted by Dr. Simon, who meets these criteria. But should we let engineers, artists and college professors untrained in such matters mess with the minds of impressiona- ble witnesses? Emphatically no. In most cases other psychological tech- niques are available which are more reliable and less intrusive. That may sound more harsh than it needs to be, but the UFO community should clean up its act without waiting for Phil Klass to do it every time. Strand: Can you be specific about what you regard as such abuse? Vallee: I cringe when I listen to tape recordings of sessions where wit- nesses are bombarded with leading questions by eager believers in this or that particular theory. There are innumerable examples. I know one witness who developed a cardiac problem during one such session, conducted by a San Francisco Bay Area UFO group. The interviewers did not know how to bring the sub- ject out of the trance. In another case a sincere witness in a close encounter case was actually interrogated under hypnosis in a roomful of other \"abduct- ees\", who took their turn describing their experiences! What is tragic in such cases, of course, is that the real data may be lost forever. Later hyp- notic regressions, even if conducted by a professional, are likely to bring back memories of the first trance rather than the event itself. All the investigators have done is to pollute the mind of the witnesses. Strand: What about lie detectors or stress analyzers? Vallee: I think they have no scientific validity whatsoever. Strand: Previously you've said that you were not very interested in dis- cussing government coverup. Don't you think that the authorities are in fact hiding something? Vallee: Sure they are hiding things, lots of things. But put it this way: if the government was trying to hide the Andromeda Nebula, do you think that would stop me from dragging my own telescope into the backyard to look at it? UFOs are not a phenomenon you can just confiscate and hide in a drawer. I am glad some of our col- leagues in UFO research are trying to get some of the hidden information into the light, but I can use my own skills better going on with the kind of research I have been doing. Strand: Do you think the govern- ment has physical proof of the exist- ence of UFOs? Vallee: If you mean that they have a lot of interesting and relevant data, yes. My guess would be that they are as utterly confused about it as eve- ryone else, and they are reluctant to come out and admit it. If you mean that the Air Force has crashed sauc- ers and humanoid bodies, then I have to tell you that I remain extremely skeptical. That whole business abso- lutely stinks. Strand: Do you have a personal the- ory about MAJESTIC-12 and its real purpose? Vallee: We are entering a hall of mir- rors here. I am rather skeptical about the ways through which the informa- tion has come out. You could make the point that a deliberate leak has been created to propagate the idea of outer space visitors and give it credi- bility through the civilian UFO organ- izations, which are more than recep- tive to that kind of \"proof. Given the names on the list of MJ-12 scientists, however, it seems to me their work could have had an entirely different orientation, having to do with psycho- logical warfare. I scratched the sur- face of that issue in Messengers of Deception, and I got burned because the UFO research community was not ready to even consider that side of the problem. Strand: Now that a few years have gone by, and that more data has come to light, can you restate the main point of Messengers? Vallee: The book states that the UFO phenomenon is absolutely real, but not necessarily extra-terrestrial. And that the idea of extraterrestrial visitors can be exploited, and indeed has repeatedly been exploited, by human organizations with very mun- dane goals. Many of our colleagues in ufology thought I was saying that the UFOs were all human craft, some- thing I never even considered. But they cannot imagine something that isn't from here, yet isn't from another \"planet\" either. Strand: Perhaps because everybody has been looking at a purely technical solution to the problem, a simple extension of our engineering and scientific knowledge? Vallee: Those who saw the long-term implications were outside the scien- tific community. When I met Mukte- nanda around the time I was writing Messengers, he knew exactly what I meant. He told me: \"They are not from another planet, they are from another planel\" Strand: Many readers saw Messengers as a break with your earlier work. Vallee: It was not. We are con- fronted here with the challenge of understanding not just another envir- onment, but another reality altogether. MUFON UFO Journal. No. 241 May 1988"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"I introduced this idea in Passport to Magonia in 1969 and later in Invisible College. Messengers was just the next book in the series, consistent with everything I'd written before. But it went further, it added a new idea which was very sensitive at the time with most ufologists: the UFO prob- lem is a social phenomenon, and as such it can be exploited, and it is being utilized even now, for purposes that have to do with contingency planning and psychological warfare. Strand: Do you have data to back this up? Vallee: I think so. When you spend enough time in the field you come across cases that turn out to be hoaxes, but hoaxes that were not contrived by the witnesses. Instead they were contrived by somebody else for the benefit of the witnesses, as part of a covert exercise. Some- times the exercise gets aborted, other times it gets out of hand. Strand: Can you give some examples? Vallee: There are two major cases that fit into this pattern, the UMMO affair in Spanish-speaking countries and the Pontoise case in France. I have researched both of these in depth. In fact I had been one of the recipients of the original UMMO material, and I have tracked some of its ramifications all the way to Argen- tina. I think UMMO is an exercise that got out of hand. Pontoise is one that was aborted. Strand: What could be the purpose of such manipulation? Vallee: A primary goal could be to stimulate the creation of a cult with strong internal structure that could later be exploited for other purposes. This was certainly successful in the UMMO affair. In Pontoise, something went wrong. I find it amusing that the witnesses in the Pontoise affair with- drew their claims of abduction in the days following publication of the French edition of Messengers of Decep- tion ... Strand: Are you hinting that there have been similar cases in the U.S.? Vallee: Absolutely. But it isn't a sub- ject that is ripe for discussion. And remember, this would only affect an infinitely small number of reports. The problem is, those are the reports that tend to become well-known through the media, and we as research ^MUFON UFO Journal, No. 241 May 1988 \"This is a phenomenon that challenges all our notions of reality, and we need to bring many dif- ferent parts of view into the debate.\" ers may have to waste a lot of energy on them before recognizing them for what they are. Strand: Why do you say the subject isn't ripe for discussion? The UFO community is filled with rumors about coverup and manipulation. That seems to have become a primary topic in recent years. ' Valle'e: Yet public opinion is still extremely naive about the methods and goals of the covert world. In the UFO field this gullibility is exacer- bated by the need to believe that the government has all the answers and isn't telling us. Strand: Should they tell us, whether or not they have the answers? Vallee: Not necessarily. When is the last time the Government told us the truth about anything else? It is the nature of bureaucracy to keep things to itself, especially when they are handled in an incompetent manner. Every time I have had a chance to gain some insight into the official handling of the UFO problem I've seen either well-meaning, but poorly- organized efforts, or just outright incompetence. Strand: Do you think MJ-12 is an outright hoax? Vallee: No, I didn't say that. MJ-12 could very well have existed, but I would look long and hard at the objectives it could have been pursu- ing, other than what the UFO com- munity currently thinks they were pursuing. Strand: Such as? Vallee: In Messengers of Deception I tried to hint at what was happening. I mentioned \"The Martians\" and the \"Double Cross Committee\" of World War II, which were high-level scien- tific enterprises of strategic decep- tion. I believe MJ-12 was in the same business. This hypothesis fits abso- lutely with the names on that list, including Menzel's name. Strand:This brings us to ALINTEL, your recent novel in French which is beginning to circulate here within a small circle. In that book I was fasci- nated by your reference to Doppler shifts in connection with the objects. Can you elaborate? Vallee: I wrote ALINTEL in fiction form to say the things I couldn't develop in Messengers of Deception. The book describes in detail for the first time what an encounter with a multi-dimensional craft would look like, and what the consequences would be. Doppler shifts were part of the physical observation of an object that is moving very rapidly while staying in one place, as a multi- dimensional craft would appear to do. the book is also concerned with the reaction of the intelligence commun- ity to the possibility of alien contact. Strand: You hypothesized that there was an organization called ALINTEL, which means \"Alien Intelligence Agen- cy\". Does it stand for MAJESTIC-12? Vallee: Not exactly. MJ-12 would be a bunch of amateurs compared to ALINTEL. The nice thing about fic- tion is that you can explore many possibilities. In the novel, ALINTEL is a world-wide organization that links East and West, because the interests of the major powers converge when it comes to identifying UFOs. Strand: Will the book be available in English? Vallee: I have been working on a translation, but I have not put a lot of energy into it, because I don't have a publisher in view yet. Strand: One last question: What do you think current UFO research needs most? Is it money, is it government support? Vallee: We need many things, includ- ing money and support. But one weakness that is especially deplorable is our lack of intelligent skeptics. I don't mean closed-minded fanatics who spend their time heaping ridicule or personal attacks against UFO wit- nesses. There are plenty of those, and I find them easy to ignore. But we need informed skeptics who are ready to look at the data. Without them the arguments for UFO reality are very one-sided. Strand: Do you think there can be open-minded skeptics in this field? Vallee: I'm thinking of people like the late Dr. Christopher Evans, who did 7"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"several series for the BBC on UFOs and on cults. He was a collaborator to OMNI. He was a true scientist and was willing to approach the question with curiosity and honesty. He was frankly skeptical about UFOs, and he made me reconsider many things, but he had really done his homework on cults. This kind of critical dialogue would enrich immensely the development of theories about what UFOs might be. As long as we are trapped between fanatical believers in extraterrestrials and quasi-religious skeptics, it will be very hard to make good progress, to construct the sophisticated theoreti- cal framework we need. This is a phenomenon that challenges all our notions of reality, and we need to bring many different points of view into the debate. Pursuing The Ultimate Encounter By Walter N. Webb Walter Webb is a MUFON con- sultant in astronomy and staff member of the MUFON UFO Journal. There is a growing belief among ufologists that the key to the UFO mystery may very well lie in the sto- ries of abduction. Most of these con- troversial cases, however, feature only one individual's anecdotal account without substantiation by another witness. And nearly all multiple-witness UFO abduction experiences have heretofore involved friends or family members where the risk of contami- nation rendered suspect the hypnotic recovery of shared abduction details. (Sometimes only one of the alleged participants has been regressed so that there was no confirmation of the abduction. In other instances, one of the hypnotized members of the group failed to support an abduction.) I have completed a very detailed and lengthy investigation into a dual- witness abduction experience which I believe is unprecedented in at least two important respects: 1. I was able to determine that neither individual saw, spoke, or cor- responded with the other over the 10- year span between the conclusion of their experience and the initiation of my investigation. Despite this separa- tion and the usual period of missing time, both observers independently filled in their time lapses with a shared abduction scenario during re- gressive hypnosis, with astonishing agreement in many major and minor details. (In Budd Hopkins' best com- parable multiple-witness case, \"Susan\" and \"Al\" recalled no mutually shared on-board details, unlike the episode which follows; shared portions appar- 8 ently were limited to a number of elements outside the UFO.') 2. My five-year probe into the incident makes it the most thoroughly investigated and documented of any single UFO abduction episode to date. I have written an in-depth case history of the encounter and its investigation and have been seeking a publisher for the book. The contents of this complex affair can only be broadly summarized here. The experience took place on August 7, 1968, at a private girls' camp on Lake Champlain north of Burlington, Vermont. Many of the counselors and campers had left the camp during a two-day break while the swim team competed in Burling- ton at a state meet. Two of the staff â a 16-year-old whom I will call \"Michael\" and a 19-year-old, \"Janet\" â stood alone on the camp dock at sunset. (Both the primary and secon- dary witnesses in this report have been assigned fictitious names.) FOUR OBJECTS Michael, who had more conscious recall of the UFO experience than Janet, reported that just after sunset a glowing cigar-shaped object sud- denly swooped down across the lake. Three small round objects emerged from the cigar and proceeded to cavort about the sky. The larger object departed. At the end of the aerial display, two of the satellite objects streaked away in opposite directions, leaving the third one which advanced toward the observers. The UFO, a classic disc with a transparent dome and revolving rim of spectral colors, ap- proached the dock, halting first about 60 feet from the end of the dock and then only 10 feet away. According to Michael, two entities could be seen through the dome of the craft, and he said they communicated with him tel- epathically. Meanwhile Janet appeared to be frozen in a trancelike state. The disc abruptly moved overhead and shone a brilliant beam of light down on the two witnesses. Michael stated that he grabbed Janet and fell with her on the dock. While under the light, Michael thought he passed out for a few minutes. The teenager's next memory was hearing the slamming of car doors and the voices of campers returning from the swim meet. From the park- ing lot, the UFO would have been partially concealed by a 15-foot-high bluff, a row of trees, and a pavilion. While most of the swimmers moved obliviously toward their cabins, two of the girls, 15-year-old \"Susan\" and \"Bar- bara,\" ran down to the bluff, appar- ently attracted by the UFO's glow. Michael asserted that the two camp- ers on the bluff cried out. At that point the hovering disc rose slightly, directed its beam across the camp in a rapid-fire sequence of flashes, and then angled upward over the lake, disappearing from sight in a matter of seconds. The male witness said he helped his dazed companion up the steps on the bluff. In addition to a memory/ time lapse, each suffered from abnor- mal fatigue and in fact fell asleep in their separate quarters right after the encounter. Of crucial importance was the fact that neither co-worker dis- cussed the sighting with each other afterward. The male observer who .MUFON UFO Journal, No. 241 May 1988"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"ELAINE (1ST UFO DEPARTURE?) SUSAN & BARBARA (2ND UFO DEPARTURE ?) PAVILION MICHAEL & JANET Figure 1 had a clear awareness of the close encounter interrupted by a time lapse recognized that his partner seemed to recall little, and he said he was afraid he might traumatize her further if he attempted to converse with her about the night's sensational events. Janet, as it turned out, possessed only a vague memory of distant lights. She told me that the day after the UFO episode she desperately wanted to talk with Michael but was at a complete loss to know what she wanted to talk with him about. Camp closed a few weeks later, and the two witnesses never saw each other again. (During my investigation the princi- pals met once in my presence. The reunion was brief and completely controlled.) Ten years later certain events occurring over the span of one year finally prompted Michael to report his sighting to the Center for UFO stu- dies. Mimi Hynek recommended him to me as a New England investigator who had dealt with similar cases before. Thus, Michael telephoned me on Halloween of 1978 and the long investigation began. ABDUCTED Within six months Janet was located in a city in the Southeast. During separate hypnosis sessions held in the Boston area, Michael filled in his missing-time gap with an abduction MUFON UFO Journal, No. 241 May 1988 SO tOO FT. sequence, while Janet confirmed not only seeing the UFO at close range but undergoing an abduction as well. In a point-by-point comparison be- tween the two narratives, the female witness verified 70 percent of her companion's alleged close-encounter details outside the UFO and 68 per- cent of his claimed on-board events. Janet confirmed being in a semicons- cious altered state both on the dock and inside the UFO. Both abductees described the faces of their alien cap- tors in similar fashion â large, elon- gated heads, enormous eyes, two nasal openings, and a small mouth- slit. Each was in constant telepathic contact with a \"guide\". Both witnesses were subjected to medical examinations in the dimly illuminated center of the craft. Michael declared that as he stood next to his guide, he watched Janet's body being probed and sampled on a table. Janet said at one point she sensed her partner's presence on another exam table and remembered seeing him at least twice aboard the UFO. An instrumented panel on the wall beyond the tables proved to be a key element, providing solid evidence for a shared abduction experience. This device was briefly introduced during one of Janet's hypnosis sessions. It was subsequently corroborated and depicted in greater detail during Mich- ael s own hypnotic interviews and finally substantiated fully by Janet in her last session. In short, despite the absence of communications between them since their experience, both observers sup- ported many specific details of each other's close encounter/abduction seg- ments, strongly indicating the suc- cessful recovery of original memory traces. A persistent search for Susan and Barbara not only turned up these two important secondary witnesses, but also uncovered a possible third as well. The two former members of the swim team retained vague memories of seeing an unidentified, silent, dark, circular object with lights along its curved edge race away from the waterfront. (Susan's memory of this fleeting event was explored under hypnosis.) Their dim remembrances of a UFO leaving the area, but not arriving, could be explained if they suddenly came upon the unknown object as Michael alleged and wit- nessed its hasty departure. Neither woman unfortunately could positively recall Michael or Janet at the scene. The playhouse director, \"Elaine\" (25 years old in 1968), recollected that her cast was rehearsing a play when there were shouts at the door about \"lights\" in the sky., Everyone dashed out of the playhouse and headed toward a clearing on the bluff. Although Elaine's view was obscured by trees, she said she was aware of a silvery glow emanating from a nearby 9"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"UFO I LAKE CHAMPLAIN DOCK Figure 2 moving source. By the time she caught up to the campers at the clearing, the glow had already receded across the lake and was fading from sight. Upon questioning the youngs- ters about what the light was, Elaine said she received varied and confused answers â none of which she now could remember. Her sighting occur- red sometime during the same week of Michael and Janet's encounter. If Elaine's and Susan's and Barba- ra's sightings did indeed happen the same evening as the primary event â and this could not be definitely sub- stantiated â it is possible that Elaine may have viewed the UFO's first departure (the abduction flight) and Susan and Barbara, the UFO's final retreat after returning the abductees. The speculation is aided by each par- ty's differing time estimates for the observations. Elaine said it was early dusk while the latter stated that it was totally dark out â between 9 10 and 10 pm. This abduction experience occurred during a period of local, regional, and global UFO activity. In fact two more UFO sightings were uncovered in July or August involving two other counselors at the same camp, and two instructors at a second camp on the lake 25 miles to the south. Michael and Janet were given MMPI (Minnesota Multiphasic Personality In- ventory) tests, PSE (Psychological Stress Evaluator) exams, and back- ground character checks. It was established to my satisfaction that both witnesses were basically honest, credible individuals who did not per- petrate a hoax (indeed they had no opportunity for collusion) nor suffer some sort of shared hallucination or delusion. The probability is high that Michael and Janet experienced a real external event of unknown origin. * 1988 Walter N. Webb (Figure 1 portrays a profile view of the camp waterfront.

Ware, Florida State Director, Charles D. Flannigan, Lead Investigator and Walter H. Andrus, Jr., International Director Copyrighted by the Mutual UFO Network, Inc. (MUFON) March 1988 INTRODUCTION The date, November 11, 1987, introduced one of the most unique on-going UFO cases in UFO history, in which investigators and researchers have had an opportunity to work alongside the principal and very coop- erative witness as the case unfolds. By journalistic policy, the MUFON UFO Journal does not publish a UFO sighting report until it has been thoroughly investigated, evaluated and assigned a definite classification: UFO, hoax, misperception, or deluded wit- ness. It is extremely rare to have an opportunity to study a continuing case of this nature and caliber. As we said in the March 1988 issue, we are breaking a precedent by inviting our readers to join the team of field investigators via the pages of the MUFON UFO Journal, in their search for evidence and answers to the incredible photographic case that may be classified as a CE I, CE II, CE III and possibly a CE IV case. Officially, the Mutual UFO Net- work will not, under any circumstan- ces, issue a statement on the authen- ticity of this case until our investigation has been concluded and all of the facts and evidence are revealed, recorded and evaluated by pertinent members of the MUFON Board of Advisors â our consultants. In the meantime, everyone can benefit by learning the methods and techniques used to unravel this mystery as it unfolds before us. If this case is exposed as a grand hoax, Journal readers will be the first to know. At this stage of the investigation, it is either one of the most incredible cases in UFO history or a most fan- tastically orchestrated hoax, one that would challenge the production skills of Steven Spielberg to duplicate. New readers to the Gulf Breeze, Florida scene should refer to the MUFON UFO Journal, No. 241 May 1988 March and April 1988 issues of the MUFON UFO Journal for published details up to this point. Yes â the photographs are continuing to be made. The latest photos were made on March 17 and 20, 1988, with dual Polaroid Sun 600 LMS cameras mount- ed on a tripod stand and boom to obtain stereo photographs as directed by Dr. Bruce S. Maccabee. On Feb- ruary 26, 1988, Mr. Ed made ten exposures of a long, multi-lighted craft at Shoreline Park South with a special 3-D Nimslo camera shipped by San Antonio-MUFON to Don Ware for this express purpose. See photo in this issue and story in the April \"Director's Message\". If your International Director sounds enthusiastic about this case, he is. At the same time there are questions and doubts plaguing Walt Andrus that must be answered by further study and investigation in order to document this case according to the principles and practices outlined in the MUFON Field Investigator's Man- ual. On the other hand, skeptical views have been expressed by Robert D. Boyd, Alabama State Director, and CUFOS Investigator Coordina- tor, and Dr. Willy Smith, UNICAT Project, which are being considered and investigated. Due to time and space, only the major events will be elaborated upon in Part II. The photograph appearing on the cover of the March Journal and page 13 (Photo No. 19) was made on Jan- uary 12, 1988. This was the first photo that had sufficient reference points to compute the size of the object and distance from the camera. The width of Highway 191-B at this point was 20 feet. In his analysis using the original Poloroid photo- graph, Dr. Bruce S. Maccabee deter- mined that the object was 12 feet in diameter and 8 feet in height, not counting the light on top. By utilizing the tire indentations on the left hand side of the highway where Mr. Ed pulled his pickup truck off on the soft shoulder, and aligning a tree above the object with this point, the dis- tance to the object was approxi- mately 185 feet. (Definitely a CE-I classification, since it was still daylight.) None of the investigators could find any evidence of damage to the black- top highway or the dual yellow lines down the center of the highway where the object allegedly hovered. Tom Roche, Santa Rosa County Civil Defense Director, performed a radio- logical survey of the highway with a CD V-700, Model #6 radiac meter and found no readings above the background radiation level of less than 0.1 milliroentgens. CEII On December 17, 1987, at 1:05 a.m., Ed made Photo No. 14 as depicted on page 10 of,/ the March Journal where the object is hovering a few feet off the ground and illumi- nating the dry grass below it. Cha- rles D. Flannigan and the photo- grapher conducted a survey of the field to determine if there was any evidence that the object may have touched down during the numerous apparent visits to this area. They found a circle of dead grass which might have indicated a potential land- ing trace case. Bob Boyd was advised by Don Ware on February 2, 1988 by telephone, concerning their find- ing. On February 12, 1988, a team of investigators composed of Don Ware, Charles Flannigan, Duane Cook, Dun- can Crow and Mr. Boyd converged on the area to conduct an investiga- tion of the alleged landing site. The circular area measured 14 feet, 6 inches in length (north to south) by 13 feet, 3 inches in width (east to west). The only observable difference 11"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"Gulf Breeze investigators (left to right): Gary Watson, Bob Reid, Donald Ware and Charles Flannigan. in the \"oval-circle\" area consisted of dead grass within the circle compared to the green grass outside of it. When Walt Andrus visited the site on March 5, 1988, the contrast between the dead and green grass was even more obvious due to normal growth. (See published photo.) The soil in the field had a high sand content when examined by Walt. Soil samples were taken by Robert Boyd from the center of the ring and control samples 15 feet west of the center. No basic differences were found in moisture, salinity, tempera- ture, pH, or other basic factors. Tom Roche, Santa Rosa County Civil Defense Director, surveyed the circu- lar area with a CD V-700, designed to detect and measure gamma radiation and detect beta radiation. None was detected. There was no evidence to indicate that the object may have touched down, only hovered as report- ed by the witness and substantiated with a photograph. The coincidences between the diameter of the circle in the field and the diameter of the object over State Highway 191-B are intriguing. If a person was perpetrat- ing a hoax, they would have had to use considerable finesse to duplicate the oval-circle of dead grass and the 12 dimensions of the object over the highway. Samples of the grass and sandy soil from the circle have been submitted to a laboratory to test for pesticides, weed killers and petroleum derivatives to determine if their pres- ence could account for the dead grass. All tests were negative. Possi- ble root damage from heating is now being investigated. Investigators living near the scene will periodically pho- tograph the circle and visually inspect it for changes in appearance and growth patterns. CEID Please refer to the March 1988 issue number 239 of the MUFON UFO Journal for two different occa- sions when small entities were involved. A single entity was observed during the night of December 2, 1987 peer- ing through the French doors of Mr. Ed's master bedroom. Five similar entities were deposited on State Highway 191-B at about 5:30 p.m. on January 12, 1988 as he was hiding under his pickup truck on the left shoulder of the road (see Photo No. 19 for the event both on the maga- zine cover and page 13. Also note a drawing of the entity on page 8). CONFIRMING WITNESSES A family friend, Patrick Hanks (pseudonym), age 20, and a junior col- lege student, had visited Mr. Ed's home on numerous occasions during the later part of December 1987, hop- ing that he would be present if the object reappeared. On December 27th at 8:15 p.m. he rang the door bell and was greeted by Ed's wife, who said \"it's here.\" Patrick walked straight through the house to the family room window where he simul- taneously observed a distant hovering object and Ed by the swimming pool in the foreground. The object was at tree top height in the southeastern sky at an estimated distance of 500 feet from .Patrick. Ed had observed the same object and was coming inside for his camera. Patrick's pres- ence was noted by Ed as he entered the house, but at the same time the object \"blinked out\"; consequently, no photographs were made. (Taken from a tape recorded interview con- ducted by Charles D. Flannigan on February 20,1988). On January 26, 1988 at approxi- mately 8:00 p.m., Ed's wife was in their backyard when she observed a similar object seen on a previous MUFON UFO Journal, No. 241 May 1988"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"Circular ring of dead grass found where UFO hovered. sighting on January 16th. She imme- diately called for Ed to come out, however he was in the shower. This object appeared to be smaller with an \"energy veil\" coming from the bot- tom. She got the camera and took one photo before Ed arrived. The first photo shows their dog in the foreground next to the pool, along with the distant object. The second photo shows a rear view of Ed with a bath towel wrapped around him and the object in the distance. He is clenching his fists and waving at the object, yelling \"get out of my life or land.\" Since these two photographs were published in the Gulf Breeze Sentinel and in the WEAR-TV Chan- nel 3 documentary titled \"The Sight- ings\" aired on March 4, 1988, we have permission to publish same in the Journal. (Now we have another photographer on the scene.) On February 7, 1988 at approxi- mately 7:00 p.m., Ed's wife was feeding their dog in the backyard. Suddenly a blue beam approximately 28 inches in diameter appeared near her. She MUFON UFO Journal, No. 241 May 1988 called for Ed to come out, but he didn't hear her. Their daughter said loudly \"Daddy, Mommie needs you.\" As Ed ran to the back kitchen door, he picked up his camera. Ed's wife said the circumference of the beam was \"rotating\" fast and leaves were being drawn up by this action. When Ed reached the back kitchen door, another \"blue beam\" appeared near the door, blocking and apparently discouraging Ed from rushing outside to help his wife. (He was very cogniz- ant of his prior experiences with the paralysis induced.) Ed made a photo from their kitchen window of this beam, with his wife attempting to get past it to enter the back door. Ed refused to allow this photo to be rep- roduced, since his wife is clearly pic- tured and could be identified. (The principal investigators have seen this photograph.) POLYGRAPH EXAMINATION When Budd Hopkins visited Mr. Ed in Gulf Breeze, Florida, and appeared in the WEAR-TV documentary titled The Sightings,\" he strongly recom- mended that Ed take a polygraph examination as further evidence con- cerning his experiences and photo- graphs. During a private meeting March 4, 1988, Charles Flannigan, Gary Watson, Bob Reid and Walt Andrus again proposed this idea to Ed and his wife. It was at this meeting that he revealed that he had been getting so perturbed with people implying that he was lying about the photographs that he had made a per- sonal decision to submit himself at his own expense to a certified polygraph examiner. The examination was conducted in Pensacola, Florida on February 18 and 23, 1988 by Harvey W. McLaugh- lin, Jr., Examiner. The purpose of the examination: To verify the authentic- ity of photographs, personal sightings, experiences, and general information supplied by Mr. concerning his experiences with UFOs since November, 1987. Point 3 of the Pre-test Interview stated: \"During the approximate 5-6 hours of pre-test interviewing the sub- ject sincerely presents this informa- tion and states that it is his desire only to aid in the verification of the information that he is taking the exam. He claims to desire no per- sonal gain or remuneration from these sightings.\" (He had refused a book company offer.) The examiner contacted both Cha- rles Flannigan and Donald Ware to solicit applicable questions that could or should be asked, in addition to standard test questions that are nor- mally used for such purposes. The following quotations are taken from the examiner's report dated March 1, 1988: Following two separate multiple chart specific issue examinations there were no specific physiological reac- tions of a deceptive nature /ioted to any of the reviewed test questions. General areas of questioning followed as: \"Did you lie or falsify the informa- tion you have furnished me concern- ing the UFOs?\" \"Did you in any way falsify or lie about the humanoid beings that you saw or any other physical evidence that you have pres- ented?\" With the information that is present at this time, furnished by the 13"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"s Ptcov.ATI OAJ o-oooe'oe. o oeoeoeoee \\ J OOOOOOOOOOO I i -  oooooooooooooooooooooooo %Â£ zoo * 30' -DIA. ^oveo i ^ February 26, 1988 at 9:30 pm. at Shoreline Park South, ten photographs were taken of a -UFO.

Opinion of Examiner: With the information that is available to this examiner at this time, it is felt that Mr.  truly believes that the photographs and personal sightings he has described are true and factual to the best of his ability. Approved: Harvey W. McLaughlin, Jr. Examiner NW FLORIDA SIGHTINGS The investigative team of Charles Flannigan, Gary Watson, Bob Reid and Donald Ware have been deluged with UFO sighting investigations that have been referred to them since the November 19, 1987, edition of the 14 Gulf Breeze Sentinel hit the news- stands and followed with weekly sto- ries. Additional articles by the Pen- sacola News Journal and the 30-min- ute, professionally produced documen- tary by Mark Curtis of WEAR-TV (ABC) Channel 3 in Pensacola added fuel to the fire. We are indebted to this fine team of investigators for all of their reports, but space does not permit the Jour- nal to elaborate on each of the Northwest Florida sighting reports. These are the same investigators who have been working so diligently on the Gulf Breeze case. Donald M. Ware, State Director for Florida, must be commended for regularly teaching Field Investigator Training Courses, because without these train- ed investigators, who were \"baptized under fire,\" this case could not have progressed to this stage. PHOTO ANALYSIS Dr. Bruce S. Maccabee, Chairman of the Fund for UFO Research and a consultant in photo analysis to MUFON, made copies of the first 23 Polaroid color photographs taken by Mr. Ed. He has also received two sets of stereo photographs made on March 17 and 20, 1988, plus samples of the 3-D photographs from the Nimslo camera shot on February 26th, supplied by San Antonio-MUFON. Dr. Maccabee's speech at the MUFON 1988 International UFO Symposium will be titled \"An Analysis of the Gulf Breeze, Florida Photographs\". He will share the techniques used to deter- MUFON UFO Journal, No. 241 May 1988"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"mine their authenticity â regardless of whether they are hoaxes or credi- ble. Walt Andrus will present a sli- de/illustrated lecture of the \"Gulf Breeze Case\" prior to Bruce's pres- entation, so as to set the stage for the analysis. This case has challenged some of the top authorities in the field of Ufology, therefore we are expecting a resolution to this intrigu- ing mystery. Dr. Willy Smith, UNICAT Project, paid a visit to Gulf Breeze, along with a team of investigators on March 19, 1988 to obtain first-hand information on the case and to view the original 23 Polaroid color photographs. He had previously been dealing with pub- lished photographs in the MUFON UFO Journal and a few second generation prints in his personal photo analysis study. He is very anx- ious to obtain detailed copies of the stereo photos made on March 17 and 20, 1988. As a physicist, Dr. Smith has noted serious discrepancies in the first five Polaroid color photos that he has had an opportunity to study. However, he has been handicapped by not having high resolution copies to evaluate. (It is evident to Walt Andrus, after studying first generation color prints, that the first five photos were not taken within a 3 to 4-minute time span as claimed by the witness, due to movement of the clouds and decreased sky illumination.) On the other hand, Robert Boyd has been playing the part of \"the dev- il's advocate\" on the team, which is a healthy situation, provided that he deals with facts and not emotions, or simply \"a gut feeling\". Since the Gulf Breeze case seems to be continuing, the MUFON UFO Journal will keep its readers as current as the logistics of publishing a magazine will permit. On the advice of several people on the investigative team and in the interest of detailing each event, Mr. Ed has submitted material to a liter- ary agent for consideration and eva- luation for a potential book on his experiences and photographs. If this case is able to stand on scientific documentation and intense scrutiny, it has all of the requisites for a \"best seller\". However, on the other side of the coin â if the investigation dis- MUFON UFO Journal, No. 241 May 1988 closes that a hoax has been perpe- trated upon the UFO community, MUFON will be the first to acknowl- edge and announce this revelation.

Johnson, Ph.D. is MUFON state director for Washing- ton and a consultant in research psychology and quantitative meth- ods. The Knowles family CE-II encoun- ter with an ovoid-shaped UFO on the Nullarbor Plateau in Western Austra- lia January 20th was right on target in terms of time and place, according to the 61-month wave cycle first pro- posed by Dr. David Saunders back in 1971. At least two other UFO encount- ers of major importance occurred that same night in Australia and Tasmania. If the indications are cor- rect and this is not an isolated inci- dent but the beginnings of a major UFO wave, we will have to recon- sider the significance of this long-term prediction in terms of our ability to predict and act upon the occurrence of this and future UFO waves. Dr. David Saunders first noticed the regularity in major American UFO waves (1947, 1952, 1957 and 1967) in the early months of 1971 while working with the UFOCAT computer catalog at the University of Colorado. He determined that what distinguished these UFO waves from other, possibly publicity-generated UFO waves, was the shape of their distributions. These were waves of UFO reports in which the frequency of daily reports began building slowly, built to a crescendo, and then dimin- ished rapidly. These negatively-skewed UFO waves occurred with a periodic- ity of five years, or more accurately 61-months, with an accuracy in peak prediction to within a day or so (1). Furthermore, another characteris- tic of these five-year waves was the progressively eastward movement of their loci of activity. The first wave crested in July 1947 and occurred predominantly in the Pacific and Mountain States.

The absence of a 1962 wave was accounted for by a search of South American references which revealed a Brazilian and Argentinian UFO wave in September, and the 1967 wave â which began on the Eastern seaboard of the United States â actually crested in November of that year in England. PREDICTION Saunders was able to make his first prediction that a major UFO wave would occur in the vicinity of 30 degrees East longitude and peak in December 1972 over a year prior to its occurrence. This prediction was borne out by the occurrence of a UFO wave in South Africa in late November. How- ever, most ufologists lost interest in the theory when the predicted waves for 1977-78 and 1983 failed to mate- rialize (so far as we can tell). Both of these waves should have occurred in countries controlled predominantly by governments unfriendly to the West. Saunders continues to have faith in the theory and has offered a consist- ent, convincing response to critics: that it is unfair to judge the merits of the theory on what we may or may not hear about from the Soviet Union. A corrollary to the Saunders' spatio- temporal wave theory is that physical evidence cases should occur at approx- imately the same time worldwide; thus, if the Australian close encoun- ters continue to occur during the pre- dawn hours, we should expect U.S. CE-II cases to occur in the evening hours between 4 and 10 pm, since the United States and Australia have a time difference of some 8-11 hours. We shall soon see if the new evi- dence merits the revival of an old theory. (1) Saunders, D.R., (1976). A spatio-tempo- ral invariant for major UFO waves. In N.

A former editor of the Journal, he is presently Director of Publications for MUFON, Con- sulting Editor to CUFOS, and a National Board Member of the Fund for UFO Research. Unin- vited Guests: A Documented His- tory of UFO Sightings, Alien En- counters, and Cover-Ups is sched- uled for publication in May 1988 by Aurora Press, Inc. of Santa Fe, New Mexico. The approximately 350-page quality paperback will retail for $14.00. To a large degree, this book represents the culmination of a long personal odyssey which began more years ago than I care to remember. I was \"there at the creation\" as a high school student when Kenneth Arnold's sighting led to the term \"flying sauc- ers\"; on active duty as an Air Force enlisted man when Major Keyhoe's book Flying Saucers Are Real was published in 1950; published a \"little noted nor long remembered\" newslet- ter on UFOs while attending Tulane University in the mid-1950's; and was an officer of the National Investiga- tions Committee on Aerial Pheno- mena (NICAP), in Washington, D.C. from 1958 to 1959. Later, I became active in MUFON and CUFOS and continued my personal quest toward understanding the nature and mean- ing of UFOs. Uninvited Guesfs draws on this long experience and represents my summa u/o/ogica â my mature thoughts on and interpretation of the UFO phenomenon. My views will give no comfort to self-styled \"skeptics\" (more accurately, debunkers) or opin- MUFON UFO Journal, No. 241 May 1988 ionated scientists who don't bother to study the phenomenon in any depth, yet think they have all the answers. Nor will the basically European school of thought, that UFOs represent a purely \"sociological phenomenon,\" find support here. To be sure, there are many sociological and psycholog- ical aspects of the UFO subject to which scholars in those fields can fruitfully apply their expertise; but social or psychological events are not the genesis of UFO reports to any significant degree. My conclusions, in a nutshell, are that (a) UFO reports are describing a real, presently unaccounted-for phe- nomenon of potentially enormous significance; (b) the reported events probably represent activities of \"beings from elsewhere\" (a carefully chosen phrase so as not to exclude origins other than planetary systems in space); and (c) there has been a Government cover-up in which vitally important information has been sys- tematically withheld from the public, whether or not Government officials have all the answers (or most of them) based on secret studies. I would not presume to suggest that I know the location of \"Elsewhere,\" or what these \"beings\" are up to. How- ever, the book contains a considera- ble amount of carefully reasoned argument and speculation designed to weigh the alternatives and narrow down the possibilities, and to stimu- late thought and (hopefully) raise the level of public discussion on these issues. A thoughtful Foreword by Dr. John B. Carlson (astronomy professor at the University of Maryland) places my work in the context of the \"Galactic Club\" and alternative views on the likelihood of extraterrestrial intelligent life and visits to Planet Earth. He terms the book a \"stimulat- ing intellectual exploration\" of the UFO mystery, and concludes that \"the potential significance [of UFOs] is awe inspiring ... The book is divided into four parts. Part I reviews and analyzes the var- ious types of UFO reports, with a strong focus on UFO-vehicle encoun- ter cases, including chapters on human- oids, \"crashed saucers,\" and abduc- tion reports. Part II examines the history and range of human reactions to UFO reports and the various the- ories advanced to explain them. Part III tackles the problem of how to evaluate UFO reports and attain- an understanding of their overall mean- ing for us. Finally, Appendices include a substantial Case Book of UFO incident report summaries represent- ing a cross-section of the UFO mys- tery, Government UFO documents, and other material. It is my hope that this will provide useful source mate- rial for serious students of the UFO subject. Throughout, I have included anec- dotes and inside information from the NICAP years, results of personal investigations, and some little known but highly significant unpublicized UFO cases. Uninvited Guests provides a broad history of the UFO subject and how people and governments have reacted to it. Inevitably,. any serious discus- sion of UFOs involves rehashing of important UFO reports, including well-known cases. I have tried to res- trict retelling of reports for their own sake (the careful reader will discover that I have totally omitted or barely mention some famous cases), and instead use reports to illustrate and analyze certain features or patterns in the data, or to make some point about interpretation of the data. UFO report junkies not satisfied by those in the text will find ample material in the Case Book Appendix. Most of all, Uninvited Guests is a book of ideas; a logical, philosophical, scientific statement of the problem and appraisal of its potential meaning for Humankind. It will challenge the 17"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"reader's beliefs head-on and offer hard facts, careful arguments, and documents that must be considered before minds can be made up. I intend for this book to be informative to the inquisitive layperson who has limited knowledge of the subject; challenging to scientists â including true skeptics â who want to learn about the hardcore evidence; and thought-provoking to new or expe- rienced UFOlogists. It offers not only a wealth of factual information and ideas, but also a long-term perspec- tive that may be useful to those who have the wisdom to appreciate it and to integrate it ihto their thinking. MUFON Management: A Quiet Crisis By Dan Wright Dan Wright is a MUFON dep- uty director. Over the past few decades, our society has experienced a continual onslaught of books and articles devoted to management theory, the total the- reof probably outstripping the pro- duction capacity of any single paper mill. Discussions of vertical and hori- zontal organizations, centralized and decentralized schemes and so forth are endlessly massaged. Two guiding principles, though, seem to cut aross all the verbiage, regardless of whether a commercial, government or volunteer enterprise is being addressed. First, as its person- nel and functions increase, so also do the levels of accountability. Bank presidents, for instance, do not call in every teller to determine how to max- imize security. That is properly handled at a series of decision-making points. Second, as an individual rises within the organization, hands-on \"mission\" work is replaced by managerial func- tions. Citing the same example, on payday the branch manager does not leap behind a cash register to help with the influx of depositors. Rather, in preparation a sufficient number of qualified staff are hired and trained, business hours may be adjusted, and efficiencies are put into place. MUFON Management As conceived by its founders, MUFON is largely a \"grass roots\" investigative organization. Encompassing every U.S. state and Canadian province, adher- ence to these two principles of man- agement is ever increasingly impor- tant. In all fairness, we have not as yet cast our \"net\" over every county and parish essentially because many 18 of those appointed to managerial positions (regional, state, and state section directors) have not performed the implicit duties of their- assigned roles. Consequently, untold numbers of sighting reports by the public con- tinue to suffer quick deaths on police blotters and in air traffic control tow- ers. This, in turn, means a skewing of the data for later research. In retrospect, the most important factor in assessing the volume of recorded reports from one state or province to the next has not been its total population, geography, climate, or the number of military bases and nuclear facilities. Instead, the prepa- ration and responsiveness of its inves- tigative group outweighs all other considerations. After two years as MUFON state section director, six as state director for Michigan and three as the central regional director, I am at once encour- aged and disheartened. Encouraged by the direct knowledge that, in many locales, MUFON can and does make a significant contribution. Citizens in search of a listening ear, open mind and expertise have been helped in large numbers, despite the benign neglect of officialdom. Discouraged because our patchwork of investiga- tive coverage is, after two decades, still far from constituting a completed quilt. Our shortcomings as an interna- tional group cannot be passed off as the inevitable result of sporadic activ- ity in the skies. Particular states such as Massachusetts, Pennsylvania and Michigan have spawned vigorous mem- berships even during lean years of reports from the public. To the con- trary, leadership â or the lack of it â is at issue. Clearly, some individu- als have been given management responsibilities prematurely, while others with that potential are lan- guishing at entry levels, waiting for the opportunity to demonstrate their potential. In order to set the record straight, the following outlines the minimum expectations for those who aspire to make a difference. SECTION DIRECTOR This, the first level of MUFON management, is for the person who seeks to directly investigate incoming reports in addition to directing field investigators. A foremost expectation is the recruitment of at least one energetic person to assist on cases and thereby learn the business. After all, witness sessions with dual inter- viewers are far less susceptible to over- sights and misinterpretations. And, obviously, multiple investigators are better able to handle a sudden influx of reported activity. A state/provincial section director is likewise expected to establish working relationships with municipal police, local airports, news- papers and the electronic media, and other public agencies. To those section directors who have been serving, in effect, as field investigators while ignoring their assign- ed managerial duties, it is only fair to ask why. STATE/PROVINCIAL DIRECTORS The director of a state or province serves in the organization's most cru- cial role. MUFON's overall successes and failures can be traced directly to them. Without substantial and relent- less efforts to recruit, train and dis- patch investigators to the sites of late MUFON UFO Journal, No. 241 May 1988"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"breaking UFO events, any organiza- tional structure is only a paper exercise. Imagine the havoc if the nation's weather were reported without a network of reporting stations manned by dedicated meteorologists. Yet, a comparable state of affairs exists over major portions of the U.S. and Can- ada as to UFO investigative coverage. The state/provincial director is not expected to be a super-investigator, racing across wide areas to handle new cases. Rather, five basic tasks are a must: (1) Find and enlist quali- fied people to enter training; (2) cor- respond with them in a standard for- mat; (3) meet with and instruct them regularly; (4) establish statewide con- tacts with police and airport authori- ties to obtain and assign raw sighting reports; and (5) lay the groundwork to receive, review and forward reports of completed investigations. In short, it is an administrative role. The achievements of those in this position are measured not by the number or quality of case reports personally generated, but by the strength of the membership and lines of communication. It is expected that public appear- ances will be made, both to inform audiences as to the true nature of the phenomenon and to enlist new mem- bers. MUFON did not grow to its present numbers by quirk of chance. There is no magic, no secret formula by which some states have dozens of qualified investigators while others languish with only a few. The former grew to their current stature because recruitment and training were priori- ties. Having acquired a cadre of volun- teers, the director of a state or pro- vince must be acutely aware of the fragility of newer members' interest. In any organization, out-stationed staff need regular updates regarding recent developments in order to retain a sense of purpose and belonging. Newsletters on at least a bi-monthly basis are indespensable for outlining activities in progress and inviting member input. Periodic membership meetings con- stitute the third expectation of this all-important position. Thereby, two MUFON UFO Journal, No. 241 May 1988 purposes are simultaneously served: Through repeated gatherings, friend- ships and a communal spirit are formed. Equally important,'experts in specific fields with a bearing on the UFO subject can impart their knowl- edge. In virtually every town or city and on every college campus, there are available speakers on the funda- mentals of astronomy and physics, aviation, meteorology, engineering and a host of other pertinent topics. They need only to be asked. Perhaps not surprisingly, MUFON members travel hundreds of miles to meetings with regularity when the agenda is alluring. The fourth expectation is to estab- lish firm links to the state/provincial police posts, sheriff departments and major airports. Wherein MUFON is not widely represented locally, this is all the more critical. A well structured letter of introduction, renewed annu- ally, ensures word of claimed anomal- ies. Most police and airport officials realize they are ill-equipped to resolve UFO reports and are willing to defer to someone competent. The fifth basic function is to clarify to the membership that all investiga- tive summaries and supporting mate- rials must be sent to the state/pro- vincial director for initial review. Origi- nal documents are then forwarded to the international headquarters and copies to the investigations director for evaluation and response. Having laid the groundwork, this ensures a satisfaction that cases are recorded for comparative analysis. The administrative duties inherent to the position would seem barely worth mentioning. Yet, in only a smattering of states and provinces are they conducted. Where there are only a small handful of members, no newsletter, no meetings, no contacts with police and airports, and no procedure for report processing, should it surprise anyone that very few UFO reports ever reach the light of day? REGIONAL DIRECTORS Overlying the state and provincial groups are four regional director- ships. Contrary to past and current practice, the intention of MUFON's founders was not to reserve an important sounding title for a few longtime members who have grown weary of the battle. Regional directors have an essential monitoring duty. If a state or pro- vince is disorganized and stagnant, it is the regional director's responsibility to assess the causes and initiate cor- rective actions. From their years of experience, they have myriad oppor- tunities to share insights and resour- ces. Correspondence would seem to be an obvious means. Where a state/- provincial director has not been per- forming and is unlikely to begin, it is logical to assume that the regional director would recommend a replace- ment. Yet, these basics have not happened. Again, one must ask why? For several years we have been individually and collectively anticipat- ing another wave of UFOs descend- ing over the continent. With some notable exceptions, however, our state and provincial memberships are ill- equipped for the occasion. In effect, an investigative disaster is waiting to happen. Completed reports arriving with regularity now suggest we are entering such a period. It can only be hoped that we as an organization can somehow catch up in a real hurry to what is happening. This is undeniably among the most important of human endeavors. To approach the task casually is to cheat the purposes for which MUFON was founded and the people out there who need someone in whom to place their trust.

Occasionally one would deviate from its course making sharp angular turns. They seemed to disappear in the distance rather than burn out and vanish sud- denly. Estimates given mention the number of objects at between 50 to 60. While Memphis citizens thought they were meteors, Air Force experts sought more advice before jumping to that conclusion. Checks were made with military installations in the region to rule out any mass flights of air- craft. In the process of investigating the incident, Lt. Col. James C. Beam discussed the case with Dr. Paul Heget of the Cincinnati, Ohio Obser- vatory. Dr. Heget expressed serious doubt that the 50 or more objects observed on the 7th were meteors. *** THIRTY FIVE YEARS AGO - May 1953 â Numerous residents of Bouffioulx, Hainault, France observed a flat, circular, shining object moving across the sky at 8:15 PM, about mid-May. The disc stopped abruptly, with an oscillating motion. Suddenly there was a loud explosion accom- panied by strong vibrations. As the disc became stationary and sharply tilted, what looked like white threads detached themselves from the craft. The threads moved away from the disc, then vanished as they fell. A few seconds later the disc levelled out and streaked away at a high rate of speed. *** THIRTY YEARS AGO - May 1958 â A bright silvery UFO over Uruguay on the 5th created such 20 intense heat in the cabin of an air- plane that the pilot was forced to open the windows and door, and remove his jacket. Carlos Alejo Rodri- guez, flying his Piper aircraft from San Carlos to Montevideo, saw the brilliant object approach on an east- erly course and apparently stop, wobbling slightly. Rodriguez, an expe- rienced pilot and parachute instruc- tor, closed to within 800 yards and saw a metallic-appearing \"top-shaped\" object, its form symmetrical above and below. Then, as the object took off at fantastic speed south toward the sea, intense heat filled the cabin of the plane. Rodriguez had always been skeptical about UFOs. After his experience, however, he reported the incident to the Director of Aeronau- tics and Air Force authorities. Later he described it publicly over the radio. Rodriguez said that the heat from the object caused him to \"sweat profusely.\" The outside temperature was only 77 degrees. He estimated that the object, which was hovering in the vicinity of a Naval Air Base, was about 50-60 feet in diameter. About 8:30 PM, (date unknown), James H. McCloud, 56, was on his lunch break in the scarfing yards at the Kaiser Steel plant in Fontana, California. As he gazed up at the sky he spotted two silver, disc-shaped objects about 1,000 feet in the air. They were perfectly round and their surface was \"rough, like tiny honey- comb pits.\" The discs came from the north at about 200 to 300 mph, then stopped in mid-air at about the center of the mill. \"I'm guessing they were 100 to 200 feet wide. They stayed there four or five minutes, then tilted forward and downward at about a 45- degree angle, then swooped upside down and went back to where they came from,\" McCloud said. They had no openings, no flashing lights and were absolutely silent. \"They were so quick it amazed me,\" he added. \"I thought no group of people on earth were capable of building those discs. I thought it might cost me my job so I kept quiet. I was afraid if I went to the sheriff they'd have a trip to Pat- ton (mental hospital) for me, so I never mentioned it.\" *** TWENTY FIVE YEARS AGO - May 1963 â A 17-year-old apprent- ice mechanic came upon a myste- rious oval-shaped UFO while driving between Glencoe and Mount Gamb- ier, Australia, on the 20th. The youth's father said his son had returned home \"white, upset and frightened.\" The youth who did not want his name released because people would think he was \"crackers,\" saw the object at about 9:30 PM. \"The object was on one side of the road, and I thought it was a truck or a bul- ldozer,\" he said. \"When my car was about 20 yards away, a bright light came on and dazzled me. I pulled up and the object moved across the road, and I then speeded up my car. The object suddenly shot straight up into the air and hovered above the car while I drove underneath. It dis- appeared for a while until I reached the main road, but I saw the object again at about the six mile post. Although I was driving at about 50 or 60 mph, the object followed the car. It disappeared soon after.\" The youth said the object was about five meters wide and three meters high. Several other sightings of the object were reported to the police. *** FIFTEEN YEARS AGO - May 1973 _ \"What I am about to relate to you,\" said Ms. Margaret K. Roffe, of Coatsville, Pennsylvania, \"happened the first part of May, when I was still working as an aide at Coatsville Veterans Hospital.\" Carrying out her evening duties, Ms. Roffe was walking from one building to another shortly after 9 PM when she heard \"the sound of swishing leaves high above the buildings.\" (There were trees alongside the buildings.) She looked up, watching in awe as a disc-shaped craft hovered directly over one of the buildings. \"As I watched, the disc descended slowly down to the roof of MUFON UFO Journal, No. 241 May 1988"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"Building I, which is four stories tall. The surrounding leaves were moving violently all the while, and soon four silver-colored legs eased slowly from the disc-shaped craft to the roof.\" Ms. Roffe felt an impulse to run, but managed to contain it, remaining where she was, between the two buildings about 150 feet away from the landing spot. Next, she said, a ramp containing steps emerged from the disc to the roof, and as she stared in disbelief, three creatures climbed backwards down the steps. \"Each creature walked to one of the jutting legs of the disc, and appeared to be examining it.\" While they were on the roof, Ms. Roffe noticed they were talking among themselves, their voices audible as \"high\" and \"squeaky,\" sounding \"like so many birds.\" She said, \"the being nearest the edge of the roof had a very large elongated head, grayish- looking skin; arms that extended well below the knees, and what looked like claws instead of fingers. His legs appeared rather short.\" She added that the creature appeared to be old, with no hair on its head. Ms. Roffe said she was able to observe every- thing clearly despite the darkness because \"the roof where this craft landed is illuminated by a light in the large dome on the left of the roof.\" One of the creatures turned and saw Ms. Roffe watching. \"The one that saw me first must have said something to the others, because they moved to the steps and went slowly up them.\" The disc then rose slowly from the rooftop, again caus- ing a flurry among the tree leaves. The stilt-legs were pulled up beneath the disc, and the craft disappeared up through the trees into the night. \"I told no one of what I saw because of a fear of ridicule. I knew they wouldn't believe me anyway ... Most people will not believe anything they do not see themselves ... I don't care if anyone believes me; I know what I saw, and I still keep thinking about it.\" The witness firmly believes she observed visitors from another planet. \"They must be far more technically advanced than us,\" she said, \"or else they surely wouldn't be here.\" About 8 PM on the 2nd, Mr. R.R. Zadow was driving across his prop- erty near Kalyan, S.A., Australia MUFON UFO Journal, No. 241 May 1988 when his truck engine stopped and the lights went out. When he came to a stop he noticed a UFO over a pad- dock about 30 yards from his vehicle. He described it as a \"very bright, glowing object which appeared to be about 18 inches in diameter.\" As it moved silently toward his vehicle he estimated it was about 40 feet above the ground, but the bright object did not illuminate the ground. As it departed over the rear of the vehicle, the truck's lights came on, and the engine suddenly started. Brian Toomey and Mick Chew observed a shiny, silver object shaped like a rocket or a cigar, stationary in the sky over Lakeside Hospital at Bal- larat, Victoria, Australia, on the 4th. The UFO appeared to be about ten feet long and flashed in the sun against a clear blue sky at 8:30 AM. Suddenly it took off like a flash toward Melbourne. Neither man heard any sound. *** TEN YEARS AGO â May 1978 - A dome-shaped object was seen by 14-year-old Tracey Segasby and her friend Michaela Field, 13, when they were putting away their horses after riding near Lowestoft, England, the evening of the 13th. The girls saw the object hovering near the ground among some trees about a quarter of a mile away from them. \"We glanced across the marshes and spotted the craft. It had a silvery appearance with bright orange lights around it. We stared at it and after about 10 seconds the orange lights changed to a pinky-red and then to a dazzling white. It then began to slowly rise above the ground, hovering for about five seconds and it then landed again. When it did so the lights turned to bright orange again,\" Tracey said. \"Then they began to fade away. It was then that we noticed four figures coming towards us. There were two large creatures standing side by side. On either side there were two small ones. They did not walk towards us. They moved in a jerky manner, at least five feet every time. The crea- tures then disappeared and the UFO gradually started to rise into the air and fade away in about 10 seconds. It was pretty scary,\" Tracey said that horses nearby were going \"really mad,\" rearing up, and that dogs were howling and barking and cats started running about. UFOs were observed and tracked by radar for more than an hour by personnel at the Pinecastle Electronic Warfare . Range, a Navy bombing range in the Ocala National Forest, Florida, on the 14th. The first report came from a man driving near Silver Glen Springs with seven other adults. The man described the sighting as an object 50 or 60 feet in diameter with flashing lights. He said it flew right over the top of the vehicle he was driving, close enough to get a good look. Following this report to the Navy facility, SK-1 Robert J. Clark, the Duty Officer, ordered the radar turned on, and the tracking device rapidly picked up an object on the screen. \"We locked, in on it and then all of a sudden, it was gone. I've never seen anything like it and I don't want to see anything like it again,\" said TD-2 Timothy Collins, who was manning the radar scope. \"First it was heading south and then it was heading north, all in the split of a second. Planes just don't have a turn- ing radius like that,\" Collins said. \"I just know I couldn't lock in. We were tracking it, and at first I thought I had it. But it started moving and by the time I caught up with it, it had changed direction.\" \"The computer wouldn't handle it,\" said Pinecastle's Lt. Commander John Sullivan. -4- YEARS â¢ IS LONG â¢ ENOUGH \\ 21"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"Message, continued ence Program Director, and Carol Ostrom, Conference Organizer, are all involved in this paranormal conference.

MUFON 103 Oldtowne Rd. /' Seguin, Texas 78155 22 The Night Sky By Walter N. Webb MUFON Astronomy Consultant May 1988 Bright Planets (Evening Sky): Venus still dominates the western evening sky. Our planet neighbor achieves greatest brilliancy on the 6th at magnitude -4.5. At this time it appears as a crescent in small telescopes and even in binoculars. But it is getting a bit lower in the sky each night, setting about 11 PM daylight time in mid-May and around 10 PM by month's end. Saturn, retrograding in Sagittarius, rises in the ESE about 10:30 in midmonth. Shining at magnitude +0.2, the ringed planet is brightening toward a June opposition. From now into September is the best period to telescopically observe the ring system at near maximum tilt. The north face of the rings is the side exposed to view. Bright Planets (Morning Sky): Mars, moving from Capricornus into Aquarius, rises in the ESE about 2 AM in mid-May. Keeping pace with Saturn in brightness, the red planet gleams at zero magnitude. The quarter Moon lies less than a degree below Mars oh the 9th. Jupiter enters the morning sky on the 2nd but is too close to the Sun to be visible this month. Saturn stands low in the south by dawn. Meteor Shower: A gibbous Moon washes out all but the brightest Eta Aquarid meteors, which peak on the morning of May 4. Under better conditions, observers might have seen up to 20 meteors per hour. The shower lasts from about May 1 to 8 in lesser numbers. Moon Phases: Full Moon â May 1 Last quarter â May 8 New Moon â May 15 First quarter â May 23 Full Moon â May 31 Two full moons in a single month. The second full moon is called a \"blue moon\". The last time this occurred was July 1985; the next time December 1990. The Stars: May is an excellent month to view three star patterns near the celestial meridian about 11 PM daylight time. v The Big Dipper, in its best position of the year high in the north, points the way to the other two groups. Follow the curve of the dipper's handle to find bright orange Arcturus. This star is located at the bottom of kite-shaped Bootes the Herdsman.

Three of these outstanding people were intro- duced at Eureka Springs, and orally expressed their sincere desire to serve as the Central Regional Direc- tor if elected to the MUFON Board of Directors by their peers. A ballot has been enclosed in this issue of the MUFON UFO Journal to all members in the Central States Region so they may vote for their choice. All ballots must be received by MUFON in Seguin, Texas, by June 20, 1988, to be counted. Dan Wright has done a superb job, therefore it will be a chal- lenge to maintain his track record of leadership and accomplishments. (Please vote promptly so your vote may be received before the deadline.) The Annual MUFON Award for the most outstanding contribution to Ufology for 1987-88 will be presented at the MUFON 1988 UFO Sympo- sium in Lincoln, Nebraska, on June 25, 1988. The following people have been nominated by members of the MUFON Board of Directors as of April 18, 1988, in alphabetical order for this prestigious award: Barry Greenwood, Budd Hopkins, David M. Jacobs, Bruce Maccabee, Paul B. Norman and Dan Wright. A ballot has been enclosed with this issue of the MUFON UFO Journal so all members and subscribers may vote for their choice to receive the plaque and recognition by their colleagues in Ufology. It was previously suggested that a short paragraph be prepared about the accomplishments of each of the nominees. This would seem superfluous or even repetitious to Journal readers, since all have been speakers at prior MUFON symposi- ums. With the exception of Paul B. Norman, the MUFON Representative for Victoria, Australia, all live in the U.S.A. and are very well known through the pages of the Journal and their own books. All ballots must be returned to MUFON in Seguin by June 15, so adequate time is allowed to engrave the recipient's name on the plaque. As the Deputy Director of Investi- gations, Dan Wright has proposed a new award to recognize an individual or a team of investigators for a spe- cific UFO sighting case which has been thoroughly investigated, reported and documented according to the principles and practices outlined in the MUFON Field Investigator's Man- ual. This will be a means of recogniz- ing an investigator(s) for exceptional work in our prime field of responsibility. To qualify as the best case(s) com- pleted in a given year, the only res- triction would be a high preliminary rating, as currently designated by the Speiser Classification. That is, a Strange- ness Factor of S4 (strange; does not conform to known principles) or S5 (highly strange; suggests intelligent guidance), together with a Probability Factor of P4 (credible and sound) or P5 (highly credible, leaving almost no doubt) would be required. For the case selected as most deserving, a framed certificate entitled \"Meritorious Achievement in a UFO Investigation\" will be presented at the Lincoln, Nebraska symposium by Dan Wright. In the circumstance of multi- ple investigators covering a single case or multiple cases of equal merit, duplicate certificates will be awarded. The calendar year January 1987 through December 1987 will apply to submittals for this award. or \"bear guard\". The star is the third brightest luminary in the entire night sky; only Sirius and Canopus are brighter. If the curve from the dipper's handle is continued through Arcturus, the next bright star that one comes to is bluish-white Spica in Virgo the Maiden. Spica is at the base of a huge crooked \"Y\" which slants up to the right. The upper branches of the \"Y\" embrace \"The Realm of the Galaxies,\" a wondrous region full of countless blurs of light â each one a spiral galaxy of billions of stars. While amateur telescopes can see the brightest of these, it is estimated that more than 30,000 fainter galaxies inhabit this particular region of space at an average distance of about 50 billion light years from Earth. MUFON UFO Journal. No. 241 May 1988 *** In addition to the newsstand maga- zjne titled UFO (formerly California UFO), published and edited by Vicki Cooper and Sherie Stark, a new magazine will go on sale June 4, 1988 with the colorful title UFO Universe. Edited by Tim Beckley (Timothy Green Beckley) and published by Al Weiss, the premier issue will feature such articles as: Beyond Communion, A Candid Conversation with Whitley Strieber; UFO Abductions: Will You Be Next?; Aliens Among Us?; Identi- fying the \"New Age\" Space Channels; Can ETs Cure Cancer and Aids?; and a special â John Lennon's Close Encounter, plus \"shocking new color UFO pix!\" It may be a new magazine, but Tim Beckley's style is reminiscent of the supermarket tabloids. He is soliciting articles and photos for future issues in return for a small fee for those that may be interested. Your Director declined an invitation to submit a requested article and photos. I sincerely hope that Tim Beckley does a better job on the magazine than he does on his newspaper called UFO Review. (Time or Tim will tell.)
