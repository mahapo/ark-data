In Chicago last year some 600 people passed through the turnstiles; at Albuquerque, the numbers were more on the order of 8-900, and this time the hotel air conditioning didn't go out as it had in both the Win- dy City and Pensacola. Our congratulations go out to Teresa Brito-Asenap and the other members of New Mexico-MUFON who made the Albuquerque symposium such a stunning success. I was unable to attend the Friday night reception but by all accounts the room in which it was held was packed shoulder- to-shoulder as old acquaintances were renewed and new ones made. The number of vendors attending was also up, with everything from new and rare books, T-shirts and UFO-related jewelry on sale. Whether success will spoil MUFON remains to be seen. What is certain, though, is that future symposium host committees will be hard-pressed to keep pace with New Mexico's laid back hospitality (and aura of UFO history) and that the organizers of same should be prepared to accommodate overflow crowds. Public interest in UFOs may well be at an all time high. Moreover, such interest is international in scope, as reflected by several of the weekend speakers, including Mr. Montague Keen from England, Philippe Piet van Putten of Brazil and Vladimir Ajaja of the former Soviet Union. In addition, MUFON's International Coordinator, Antonio Huneeus, gave a comprehensive slide-survey of current global UFO activity. But the centerpiece of the Albuquerque banquet was un- doubtedly Budd Hopkins' update of what promises to be the most sensational abduction case of the century — one which not only involves multiple independent witnesses but perhaps a political figure of major standing. Hopkins not only \"wowed\" the crowd with eyewitness illustrations and audio tapes per- taining to this particular case, he also introduced the central figure of this potential landmark event in person. Unfortunately, Hopkins, apparently well on the way to full recovery following a recent kidney operation, did not provide a printed paper for the Proceedings. In other words, you had to be there. The other papers are printed in full, however, and the entire 231-page Proceedings are available from MUFON for $20 plus $1.50 p&h. Aside from those speakers already mentioned, Jacques Vallee, Linda Howe, Stanton Friedman, Walt Andrus, Richard Haines, Jeffrey Sainio, Dr. Richard M. Neal and Clifford Stone also gave presentations. The follow- ing summary of events draws heavily on their printed papers. MUFON's international director, Walter H. Andrus, Jr., meets the Albuquerque press. MUFON's Extraordinary Role O rdinarily Walt Andrus opens the annual MUFON sym- posium with a few words of greetings and turns the rostrum over to the local organization and master of ceremonies. This year, however, following the usual introduc- tions and speeches by Linda Howe and Richard Haines, he presented a full-fledged paper of his own entitled \"The Role of the Mutual UFO Network in UFO Research.\" After a brief history of both the Aerial Phenomena Research Organization (APRO) and the National Investigations Com- mittee on Aerial Phenomena (NICAP), Andrus outlined the origin and structure of the Mutual UFO Network itself and its subsequent growth and development into the world's largest civilian UFO organization, currently boasting nearly 4,000 members worldwide. MUFON's success, said Andrus, could be attributed mainly to \"the grassroots structure of the organization, composed of dedicated volunteers who fully recognize the scientific im- portance of the challenges associated with the UFO phenomenon.\" MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 292 August 1992"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Dr. Richard F. Haines, founder and co-director of the Joint USA-CIS Aerial Anomaly Federation. Pilot Sightings Involving Electromagnetic Effects \"Reports of anomalous aerial objects appearing in the at- mosphere,\" said Dr. Haines. \"continue to be made by pilots of almost every airline and air force of the world in addition to private and experimental test pilots.\" Fifty-six such cases were examined by Dr. Haines \"in which electromagnetic ef- fects took place on-board the aircraft when the phenomenon was located nearby, but not before it appeared or after it departed. These effects were not related to the airspeed or altitude of the aircraft. The average duration of the 37 cases in which duration was noted was 17.5 minutes. Eyewitnesses on the aircraft numbered between one and 40, with an average of 2.71. \"Reported E-M effects included radio interference or total failure, radar contact with and without simultaneous visual contact, magnetic and/or gyro-compass deviations, automatic direction finder failure or interruption, dimming cabin lights, transponder failure and military aircraft weapon systems failure. There appears to be a reduction of the E-M effect with the square of increasing distance to the anomalous aerial phenomena.\" Dr. Haines said that \"other investigators should concen- trate on this particular area of research because of the wealth of information it might possibly yield about the nature of such anomalous aerial objects, including wave- length/frequency and power density emissions.\" The UFO Jigsaw \"It's been 45 years since the first rumors of crashed 'flying saucers' were heard — and then covered up,\" said Linda Moulton Howe, an independent producer of video documen- taries. \"Now, in 1992, the mystery has become a complex pu/zle of many pieces. These include eyewitness descriptions of alien beings that vary in size, coloring and type, and puzzl- ing symbolic formations in fields of wheat, corn, barley and other plants. \"The puzzle includes people who suddenly have amnesia for an hour or more, day or night, and recall in dreams or under hypnosis that non-human beings took them for examina- tion and removed tissue, sperm, ova — even their minds, in some instances. In addition, there are eyewitness accounts of non-human creatures with animals that disappear or are later found with bloodless excisions of genital and other tissue which, in some cases, reveal high heat damage along the cut lines. \"Anomalous trauma victims, or abductees,\" Howe added, \"report that small objects are sometimes implanted in a nostril, eye, ear, ankle, the genitals or other body part. Some ab- ductees describe seeing or being asked to hold a 'baby thing' which they understand to be a hybrid that is part human and part something else. \"The puzzle also includes the emergence of alleged govern- ment documents and eyewitness descriptions not only of crashed flying saucers over the years, but of the retrieval of these disks and their occupants known as 'extraterrestrial biological entities,' or EBEs. At least one scientist has reported engineering bays inside the Papoose Mountains at Nellis AFB, Nevada, where retrieved alien craft are studied and efforts made to reverse-engineer the advanced technology under in- tense security. \"And finally, there are reports from construction workers and military personnel about underground tunnels and habitats where an alien intelligence resides and works unseen on our planet while we humans, above ground, ignore its presence.\" Doubt and Deviousness in the UK Crop-Circle Scene The first of the symposium's international speakers was Mon- tague Keen, the convenor of the Crop Effect Panel for the Centre for Crop Circle Studies, and the author of 1991: Scien- tific Evidence for the Crop Circles Phenomenon. \"In erratically rising numbers,\" noted Keen, \"crop circles have been appearing and reported in England over at least the last 12 years. Little can be safely said about any aspect of them which commands general assent, save that they are readily distinguishable from lodging (the phrase we use to describe crops laid flat by wind and rain), both by precision of the edge separating the flattened from the upstanding crop, and by MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 292 August 1992"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Montague Keen of the Centre for Crop Circle Studies the neat, apparently undamaged manner in which the crop has been left lying swirled clockwise or counterclockwise.\" Cereology, as the study of crop circles is called, went relatively, smoothly, said Keen, \"until about the mid-1980's, when opinion on the origin of these formations became sharp- ly divided. Rival groups were embarking on that escalator of mutual antagonism which seems to be a feature inescapable from the painful process of scientific investigation into any phenomenon which fails to fit comfortably into the paradigm of conventional physics. \"In consequence — and doubtless because the crop circles business was beginning to assume commercially marketable dimensions — information on individual formations began accumulating in private archives. How many still linger in inaccessible data bases we do not know. Indeed, the absence of cooperation among the various research groups, and of common criteria for recording, are among the most noteworthy and least proud achievements of the crop circle industry in England.\" At any rate, cereology soon split into several camps. In one corner was Dr. Terence Meaden, who proposed the original plasma-vortex theory, \"the only one to surface thus far,\" Keen noted, \"which makes any serious attempt to fit the formations, however uncomfortably, into the straight]acket of conventional physics. Although much denigrated by critics, including conventional physicists and meteorologists, it represents a painstaking effort to record and make sense of a mass of evidence which Mea- den and his colleagues had spent years collecting and studying. \"The plasma-vortex theory attempted to account not only for multiple rings, satellite and grapeshot circles, but also for the reports of associated luminosities, strange nocturnal noises and disturbing effects on domestic pets. Indeed its more vocal supporters claimed it as the definitive explanation of all UFO sightings, and wrote a book to sustain that view.\" Critics claimed that no known meteorological phenomenon had ever developed over the years as crop circles had appeared to do,, especially in such numbers and patterns. Meaden's plasma vortex was also not an ordinary whirlwind, in that it necessarily involved downward wind pressure as opposed to a vertically rising air current. Moreover, crop circles seem- ed to violate the law of angular momentum. In other words, according to Keen, Meaden was proposing \"a rapidly cir- culating pneumatic force which managed to exert no more pressure, and do no more and no less damage to crops at the periphery of a 100-foot-wide circle than at the center, although presumably moving at vastly greater speed.\" Photo Analyst Jeffrey W.

Haines (r) at the historic first board meeting of the new Joint USA-OS Aerial Anomaly Federation held in Albuquerque, NM, on Monday, July 13. Also present were members of MUFON, the Center for UFO Studies and the Fund for UFO Research. Several attempts to monitor the phenomenon by night have been undertaken in recent years, but with largely inconclusive results. As a consequence, the search for scien- tific evidence for an anomalous (or at least previously unknown) phenomenon has concentrated largely on the analysis of soil and plant samples. While the latter approach shows promise it, too, is a complicated process and the findings subject to considerably varying interpretations. Nonetheless, work in that area continues to go forward this summer, although the results will not be known for sometime. In the meantime, said Keen, the subject has been greatly complicated by the involvement of human hoaxers. Ufology: New Practices The international theme of the Albuquerque symposium was reiterated with a Saturday afternoon presentation by Dr. Vladimir G. Ajaja, vice president of the UFO Center in Moscow. The visiting Russian ufologist said that progress in ufology would probably have to wait for a reconsideration of our ideas about the material nature of the universe. \"The variety of mat- ter consists not only of the world of things,\" he said, \"but of that of energy, information, intelligence and time. The world is not just three dimensional. Such an approach may help ex- plain the apparent polymorphism of the UFO phenomenon.\" Perhaps as important as Dr. Ajaja's talk, however, was the first board meeting, on Monday, July 13th, of the renamed Joint USA-CIS Aerial Anomaly Federation, CIS standing for the Commonwealth of Independent States formerly repre- sented by the Soviet Union. Along with Dr. Haines, Dr. Ajaja is co-director of this promising new cooperative venture. Also present at this historic occasion were representatives of the American UFO organizations that will be coordinating cooperation into the study of the UFO phenomenon from this side of the Atlantic, namely MUFON, the Center for UFO Studies and the Fund for UFO Research. Dr. Vladimir Rubtsov of Kharkov, in the Ukraine, was also scheduled to attend, but was unable to travel because of last- minute complications. The planned activities of JUSA-CISAAF will include data exchanges, the reciprocal translation of UFO publications, and hopefully joint field investigations. A personal account of the trip to Russia by Dr. Haines that ultimately led to this latest cooperative venture will be published in Timothy Good's forthcoming The UFO Report 1992 (Sidgwick & Jackson, London). MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 292 August 1992"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"Jacques Vallee's Forbidden Science: The UFO Phenomenon and the Research Community S ome cinema buff out there can probably correct me, but if my memory serves, the late French film director Fran- cois Trufraut once did a b&w film by the title of \"Don't Shoot the Piano Player.\" Ironically, Trufraut also played the character Lacombe in the Steven Spielberg production of \"Close En- counters of the Third Kind,\" a role loosely based on the real- life career of Jacques Vallee, arguably the most prominent (and controversial) ufologist of this or any other century. Vallee must now feel as if art really does imitate life; for the more he expounds his message to the UFO community, the more body shots he has been forced to absorb in the process. The tragedy is that his unsettling message has largely been lost among the smoke and sound of gunfire. That message can be summarized in a couple of sentences. First and foremost, mainstream ufology has become so en- tranced by, and enamored of, the standard extraterrestrial hypothesis that it can no longer see the phenomenological forest for the trees. Secondly, nowhere are the consequences of same more evident, and more potentially fraught with peril, than in the study and increasingly public promotion of that subset of the UFO phenomenon referred to as abductions. \"The American public,\" said Vallee, \"is being taught to ex- pect an imminent landing by extraterrestrials and to recognize them as short, gray aliens with big dark eyes. The fact that real UFO witnesses actually describe a wide variety of other shapes has been censored, to such an extent that some research groups do not even accept these other shapes into their database.\" I know this to be true, Vallee argued, \"because like a few other researchers, / happen to have evidence, in the form of first-hand data, that flies in the face of the theories theabductionistsare marketing.\" Cue cards weren't required to know which UFO research groups and abductionists Vallee had in mind. In fact, Vallee sees himself as waging war on two fronts. Thus the \"forbidden science\" of his talk refers not only to how orthodox science perceives ufology as a whole, but to how ufology itself treats the supposedly anomalous data that doesn't readily match its own established precepts and paradigms. If science is guilty of ignoring inconvenient evidence, then so, too, is ufology, says Vallee. The truth in either case is apt to be less obvious than surface appearances would indicate. In Vallee's own words, \"the pursuit of ufology is a forbid- den science, and doubly so; the skeptics do not want free in- quiry on the subject because it might disturb their rational universe. And many advocates are equally opposed to free inquiry because the systematic application of the tools of science to this problem might reveal their incompetence as researchers.\" This is a strong message, but in my opinion it seems rather petulant and premature to shoot the piano player before the song has finally played itself out.

A relative newcomer to MUFON, Mr. Sainio is manager of Imaging Research and Development at the Quad/Tech Division of Quad/Graphics in Wisconsin. There are three basic techniques, said Sainio, the first be- ing the most obvious (and sometimes overlooked), which is simple visual inspection of the photograph itself. Do all the elements fit together and make sense? For example, are all the pictured objects (UFO, trees and buildings) illuminated by the same angle of sunlight? Secondly, Sainio advises try- ing to replicate the original picture as closely as possible, in- cluding the use of the same equipment under similar condi- tions. \"Many Monday-morning quarterbacks,\" he said, \"fre- quently hypothesize how a particular photograph might be replicated but fail to test their ideas using this simple but often time-consuming process.\" The third approach involves sophisticated computer analysis which can often be carried out, at increasingly affordable prices, on a desktop home computer, preferably either a 386-based PC or 68020-based Macintosh (or higher) system. Images can be. digitally enhanced by computer and various picture elements analyzed for edge-sharpness, color contrast and density and so on. Sainio illustrated such approaches with numerous examples of known hoaxes and other photographs thought to be genuine. Many of the Gulf Breeze photographs taken by Ed and Frances Walters were analyzed during the course of Sainio's slide-show, often with interesting results. In a number of cases, the internal evidence in the photos themselves would seem to rule out a particular hoax hypothesis; in others anomalies were revealed that need to be taken into account in any final analysis of their genuiness. Sainio also devoted part of his talk to an analysis of videocassette film taken of the infamous Gulf Breeze \"RUFO,\" or red UFO, which has often been compared to ordinary road flares held aloft by a balloon or some other aerial device. However, said Sainio, there are a number of observable dif- ferences; a videotaped road flare shows signs of sputtering, whereas the RUFO doesn't. Moreover, an analysis of the color spectrum reveals that a typical road flare has more green while the RUFO has less green and more blue. Despite lower resolution (or less information) than still film, videos are harder to fake, said Sainio, and they \"often add another dimension, time, to the record of events,\" along with sound, or a lack of same, and a better sense of distance. \"In conclusion,\" he added, \"conclusions are not a good idea in ufology. However, I will predict that the proliferation of low- cost, high-quality camcorders will eventually revoluntionize the quantity and quality of the UFO physical evidence.\" MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 292 August 1992"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"The Abduction Case of the Century\" B udd Hopkins spoke Saturday evening on what may turn out to be the most astonishing UFO abduction case of the century, one involving multiple independent witnesses to the actual abduction, a missing, although X-rayed, implant and a major political figure. At the end of his talk, Hopkins was joined on stage by the abductee herself, introduced as Linda, an attractive brunette apparently in her mid-30's, who said that her experiences \"were as real as a city bus or taxi.\" Since Hopkins himself will be submitting a fuller report to the Journal soon, I'll confine myself here to only a brief outline of the case. In the early morning hours of November 30, 1989, Linda was abducted from her 12th-floor bedroom in Manhattan, quite near the Brooklyn Bridge, after being floated through her apartment wall or window in the com- pany of three alien beings and then lifted along a beam of light and into a hovering UFO. In a stalled car two blocks away were two men who original- ly identified themselves as New York City detectives. Both say they saw a woman, dressed in a white night gown, emerge from the top floor of high-rise apartment building in a fetal position, accompanied by \"three of the ugliest creatures we had ever seen.\" The four were then 'beamed' aboard the waiting UFO. Subsequent information uncovered by Hopkins indicates that the two were actually in the employment of a higher government security agency, and that a political figure, who they were in the process of transporting to the United Nations helicopter pad, was in the back seat of the car and also witnessed the abduction. Another independently reported witness has also come for- ward, a woman who was driving on the Brooklyn Bridge at the same time. Her car had stalled, too, as had others on the Bridge. And she also said she saw a woman float out through the wall of a building, along with three small beings, all of whom were then floated into a UFO. She made a drawing of what she saw, as did one of the two \"detectives,\" slides of which Hopkins showed during his speech. He is now in the process of trying to locate the other stalled motorists (and potential witnesses) who were on the Bridge at the same time. The case also involves a nasal implant, captured on X-ray and apparently removed the day or so after. If it continues to hold up under scrutiny — and especially if the political figure can be induced to come forward and corroborate events — then this could indeed be the \"case of the century.\" Worldwide Ufology Hopkins' \"act,\" as might be expected, proved hard to follow, but Sunday's speakers tried their best. The first was Philippe Piet van Putten, MUFON National Director for Brazil, and director of the Brazilian Academy of Parasciences in Sao Paulo, who reported on recent UFO cases in his country and the current state of Brazilian ufology. Van Putten was followed by Clifford Stone, director of research for the recently established UFO Enigma Museum in Roswell, New Mexico. Stone's present line of research, being conducted via the Freedom of Information Act, con- centrates on the retrieval of classified government documents pertaining to an Operation Blue Fly, thought to be involved in crashed UFO recoveries. Further information can be found in Stone's UFOs: Let the Evidence Speak for Itself. The Missing Embroyo/Fetus Syndrome R ichard M. Neal, M.D., a MUFON medical consultant and one of the original founders of the Los Angeles UFO Research Group, addressed the issue of missing embryos reported by abductees, of which there are several, beginning with the now classic case of Debbie Tomey, first reported under the pseudonym of \"Kathie Davis\" in Budd Hopkins' 1987 book, Intruders. However he could find no convincing medical evidence of a missing fetus or embryo that could be attributed to abduction by alien beings. Dr. Neal began with a review of the pre-Intruders abduc- tion literature, extending the relevant thesis of nocturnal visitors in general to include Dr. David Hufford's generally overlooked signpost, The Terror That Comes in the Night, a study of the supernatural assault tradition typified by the Old Hag accounts encountered in Newfoundland. In the main, sexual activity, and particularly sexual activity leading to pregnancy (which later goes \"missing\" or otherwise), is a relatively rare component of the Old Hag experience. The theme is also conspicuously absent from Dr. Eddie Bullard's two-volume landmark survey of the then extant ab- duction literature, UFO Abductions: The Measure of a Mystery, published in the same year as Intruders. Bullard wrote Neal that \"this element (of missing embryos) did not appear in any of the abduction stories I studied.\" In fact, most such cases, said Neal, are merely hear-say that fall into two distinct categories: women who say they have been artifically impregnated during the course of an alleged abduction by alien beings, or who claim they were im- pregnated via actual, i.e., physical, sexual intercourse. The latter, Neal said, seems curiously odd in that the 'typical' alien Gray is usually described as lacking external genitalia. By the same token, assuming aliens lack sexual organs, why produce spermatozoa at all? In other words, how do human female earthhngs become pregnant by the reported extrater- restrial intruders in the first place? These are major questions, Dr. Neal suggests, and the more so since missing fetus cases bear resemblances to the psychological aftermath typically associated with rape and subsequent post-traumatic stress, and because they tend to emerge in dream states or under hypnotic trance. And on a purely physical level, there are a number of medical factors, including spontaneous abortion and secondary amenorrhea (cessation of the menstrual cycle), that may easily mimic the missing fetus syndrome. MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 292 August 1992"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"More Worldwide Reports J. Antonio Huneeus, MUFON's International Coordinator, spoke Sunday afternoon on \"Global Ufology: Worldwide Cases, Of- ficial Policies and Ufological Attitudes.\" Virtually a one-man, walking encyclopedia of international UFO knowledge, Huneeus gave a far-ranging update of recent cases occurring in France, Belgium and Japan, the official UFO policies of those coun- tries, and how they compare with that of the United States. The contrast is often dramatic. During the recent Belgian flap, for instance, the military and civilian government then in power displayed a remarkable degree of cooperation with the local civilian UFO groups. At about the same time, a similar flap was underway in France, where the official response was more muted but still somewhat more friendly and open than what we might expect here. Huneeus also reported that the government's former Study Group of Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (GEPAN) has been reorganized as SERPA, an organization charged mainly with tracking and identifying At- mospheric Re-entry Phenomena, in other words, satellities. There is much debate (and dispute) within the French UFO community as to the official role played by GEPAN; some say it was a public relations entity along the lines of our own Pro- ject Blue Book, others that is was actively involved in the dissemination of disinformation, although the latter charges are under a cloud of suspicion and remain unfounded. The Japanese public, according to Huneeus and other sources, may be more entranced by the UFO phenomenon than any of us. This has resulted, in at least one case, in the govern- mental or public funding of a UFO Museum and Archives in the small city of Hakui in Ishikawa Prefecture on Japan's western coast. In private, former Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu has also expressed a personal interest in the subject. These various approaches, noted Huneeus, can be readily compared with the lacklustre attitudes of our own country. Crashed Saucers, MJ-12 & Debunkers Stanton Friedman, who closed out the Sunday afternoon speaker's program, was his usual voluble and entertaining self. While much of the territory covered resembled familiar ter- rain (to anyone who has heard Friedman deliver his speech, \"UFOs Are Real\" before), new details about the 1947 New Mexico crashed saucer cases are revealed in his printed paper in the Proceedings. Friedman not only takes the more public and visible UFO debunkers to task, but also offers up a few sharp barbs for some of his colleagues within ufology who seem reluctant to jump aboard the Roswell and MJ-12 band- wagon for whatever reasons. Stanton puts all this much better in person than I could ever hope to here, and as I said, his latest paper is available in the published MUFON Proceedings. A much fuller case for the New Mexico crashes can be found in Friedman's new book, Crash at Corona (Paragon Books), co-authored with Don Berliner. EDITOR'S COLUMN You'll read elsewhere in this issue about the public proceedings that took place at the Albuquerque, NM, symposium. This particular column, however, is to inform you of the current state of the MUFON UFO Journal and the future changes adopted during the Sunday morning meeting of the MUFON Board of Directors. First, the good news. For starters, both MUFON and the Journal have never been healthier. We have long been the world's only monthly publication devoted to UFO studies; with a print run of just under 4000 copies per month, we are also the planet's largest such publication. In the last few weeks alone I received queries from publishers in England, Scotland and Spain requesting permission to reprint articles which originally appeared in our pages. This is a practical measure of how highly we are regarded by our peers. Moreover, during a recent visit to England, I was both sur- prised and encouraged to learn that the Journal was considered required reading for anyone remotely interested in UFOs. The inevitable component of success, however, is change, and we have a couple of same to announce. In short, we will soon be phasing out two of our regular columns, Robert Grib- ble's \"Looking Back\" and Lucius Parish's \"In Others' Words.\" In their stead there will be an increased emphasis on the \"Cur- rent Case Log\" as compiled by a variety of our Regional Directors, including Gribble. Robert's regular column has long been one of our favorite features. As editor, we'll miss his monthly contributions, and I'm sure our readers will as well. But Bob also operates a national UFO Hotline, and that, along with the demands of a monthly update of historical UFO cases, is simply too much to ask of one individual. Any excess energy will now go toward keeping us informed of current cases in his region. MUFON will continue to support the postage costs involved in mailing Cribble's national UFO Hotline Newsletter to government agencies. Another column we'll hate to see go is Lucius Parish's \"In Others' Words.\" While highly informative, much of the infor- mation contained therein was typically a month or two behind our own publication schedule, rendering the magazine listings in particular relatively moot, through no fault of the author. I hope I speak for all of us when I say how highly we have appreciated and enjoyed the selfless contributions of Robert Grib- ble and Lucius Parish. May they both live long and prosper. In their place we hope to be able to provide a monthly listing of current UFO cases, collated and summarized by MUFON's regional directors, each citing both location, the event, and the local investigators involved. In this way we hope to focus on the present status of the UFO phenomenon rather than draw attention to its past exploits. Beginning this issue, we'll also.be adding a regular feature, \"Readers' Classifieds,\" to the Journal's makeup.

Tilly, M.A., is MUFON's Director of Public Education and a clinical hypnotherapist. j After spending hundreds of hours working with abductees, 5 I would like to take exception to some of the ideas expressed by Ann Druffel in \"Resisting Alien Abductions\" (March 1992) and to what appears to be a growing trend in counseling these individuals. Just over a year ago I first became aware of this practice when several interested psychiatrists stated at a meeting that they were now giving abductees instructions that they could resist future abductions if they would only try. Druffel elaborates in her article by giving at least nine techni- ques which can be employed in supposedly stopping the in- truders from accomplishing their missions. Druffel says, \"witnesses are the best judges concerning the motives of entities who contact them.\" While it is true that ultimately each person must decide for him or herself how to respond to the experiences, there are many reasons why one's understanding about what is happening may not be clear- ly established. In working with such individuals it is apparent that many of them wish or hope (and often convince themselves) that the experiences are something that fits in with their belief system. They then conduct themselves in an appropriate manner, and speak with absolute conviction about what is happening to them. Upon closer inspection many often realize that the experiences have not been all that they had thought them to be. In many instances it is religious faith which colors one's reactions. This phenomenon is then interpreted as being saved, as having visions of a holy person or an angel, being snatch- ed by satanic forces, or feeling that benevolent beings are directing their lives. Mostly though, there is apparent disin- formation or too little information for anyone, myself included, to accurately judge the true motivations of these entities. The best we can do is make guesses. It appears, however, that at least some abductees have a deep psychological need to believe certain things about their abductors - whether that is for peace of mind or because of a previous belief structure. When one can \"step back\" and look at the experiences from a broader perspective the motives of the entities appear unintelligible or, at best, confusing. D ruffel goes to great lengths to establish that the entities do not have superior technology (a position with which many would take exception) therefore must not be extrater- restrial. She then assumes that we should thus be able to work against them. I find this concept to be totally illogical. Where they come from or what they are capable of doing has little or nothing to do with our ability to resist them. Whoever, or whatever, they are, they possess a remarkable under- standing of the functioning of the human mind. The control they exert over us via mind power alone - even being able to change our perceptions of \"reality\" - is truly awesome. We know so little about our own minds, and use so little of our brain. But apparently our \"visitors,\" whether through technology or some other method for which we have no com- prehension, have transcended that. It may also be inappropriate to assume that the process is really \"for the purpose of genetic experiments, interbreeding ...\" Again, this seems illogical. Why such a primitive method of harvesting sperm and ova? It is common knowledge that such genetic material is readily available in any number of laboratories around the world. Is it possible that this too is a cover memory for something else? Furthermore, I am not at all sure that we can say that that activity (or at least some similar memories) are not \"mentioned in the literature of our major philosophies and religions.\" A thoughtful reading of many ancient texts (the Biblical book of Genesis being just one example) as well as myths and legends worldwide, reveals stories of \"heavenly\" beings and humans interacting. Likewise, I challenge the notion that \"The process would take place without trauma.\" It would be nice if that were so. Yet birth is a traumatic event for both mother and child, but one that must be experienced if there is to be life. Most of us also go through some radical, frequently very traumatic, changes in our personal lives. If we survive them with an intact personality we experience personal growth in the pro- cess. Why should this monumental phenomenon with which we are dealing be any less so? It is also curious that Druffel, and many others, seem to believe that if the entities were advanced (and therefore ex- traterrestrial) they would recognize that we have individual rights. Perhaps our concept of inalienable rights is an aber- ration of time. Historically, with the divine right of kings, that was a virtually unheard of concept. Certainly Adolph Hitler, the Nazis, and now the rapidly growing, worldwide neo-fascist movement would never subscribe to such a philosophy! Again, it seems illogical to assume that since these entities treat humans as possessions they therefore could not be extraterrestrial. And since they do treat us as possessions, why would it become logical to assume that we can overpower them and prevent the abduction experiences? Why is being \"intradimensional in nature\" proof that the entities are not extraterrestrial? This non sequitur and its com- panion, the ability \"to shape-shift according to the demands of the moment,\" do not make a case for humans being able to prevent their own abductions. Similar lack of logic is displayed in the statement, \"if these entities are not technologically superior to us and are not a permanent part of our space-time, human beings should be able to break off contact with them if they choose.\" Many people think, at least for awhile, that they have broken off contact, but that appears to be more a hope than a reality. My experience with abductees has been that eventually they realize that the abductions have been continuing all along; they have just been sublimating the experience, denying that it could possibly still be hap- MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 292 August 1992"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"pening to them. Druffel also claims that because the mind is \"capable of affecting matter, as demonstrated by psychokinetic ex- periments in parapsychological labs, \"We should therefore be able to fend off invasion by other-dimensional creatures.\" While I do not deny that psychokinetic activities are possi- ble, there is no reason to believe that except for relatively rare incidents (or rare individuals) only the most minimal feats have been accomplished. If we carry Druffel's logic a bit fur- ther, theoretically you should be able to set this page on fire with your mind. (Probably more easily than fending off in- vading intruders who have already displayed incredible abilities at human mind control.) Yet for most of you this has not, and will not happen. A yogi could most likely accomplish such a feat but most humans have not achieved such capabilities. As stated earlier these entities are masters at con- trolling the human mind and without some very advanced training I fear that we are not yet a match for their talents. \"IT Thile the techniques given for resistance may sound VV impressive, in actuality they are not very helpful. I ques- tion whether \"mental struggle\" and \"righteous anger\" real- ly accomplish anything. Repeatedly abductees have related accounts of responding in such a way, but it never, to my knowledge, prevented any abductions! Believing that physical struggle (with or without some type of mental gymnastics) in which an arm or a toe is moved, or a lunge is made at an entity and then the abductors supposedly disappear is, as many researchers have already realized, the end of an abduc- tion (or as Budd Hopkins might say, \"the get-away car\") not the prevention of one. I am aware that many abductees have an intuitive feeling, a gut level reaction, when one of these experiences is about to happen. It may, or may not, be possible to do something as soon as one has that awareness, thus preventing (at least for the time being) the abduction. In all likelihood at best it can only delay, not prevent, the abduction. Furthermore, one is probably already in an altered state of consciousness when that feeling begins and this is probably the early stages of the experience. For some reason at a certain time, for some individuals, there is that \"window\" of awareness at the onset. If we understood more about that window we might find it an actual opening to understanding the phenomenon. Many abductees have resorted to taping messages to their abductors on their bedroom windows or walls, or on their own legs; to setting up video cameras; or to using prayer, meditation, the Bible, crosses, crucifixes, rosaries and the Sacred Heart. As a result they usually feel at least protected, and for awhile some even believe that they have stopped the experiences. Again, there is much evidence to suggest that this too is a form of denial, and, just as with other techni- ques it does not stop the abductions. In fact, most people I know who have used such techniques have eventually acknowledged that it has not stopped the abductions, though it seemed to at the time. Using white light, internal sound, \"expanding the sub- conscious,\" and other such techniques are all forms of self- hypnosis. Using one's own suggestions to enter a deep state of altered awareness probably actually facilitates the work of the abductors. In no way should we assume that any of these prevents abductions from taking place. \"protective rage, I doubt, has ever accomplished anything. A There are innumerable stories, primarily from horrified parents, who knew that someone for whom they were respon- sible was being abducted and they were powerless to prevent it. Most of these individuals are completely mystified as to how they could have peacefully fallen back to sleep thinking \"Everything is okay,\" when something was seen going into a child's room. A frantic desire to protect has not stopped abductions! Someone who believes that is has probably needs to feel that way in order to overcome their own guilt or fear at having been so impotent in the face of danger to a loved one, or someone they had wanted to help. I would never mean to suggest that we tell abductees that what they think they are controlling, they are not. That must come from them. Each person needs a \"comfort zone.\" We must, however, be ready to support them when they reach that level of awareness and their cushion of safety has disappeared. My very grave concern, though, is that as counselors we not encourage people to deny what has been happening. Denial is never a good form of therapy. I cannot help but wonder if this is not being done because of the therapist's need to feel that there is something that he or she can do to help the victim. I know well the feeling of helplessness in not being able to assist a victim in finding a way out of this trauma. Very recently someone said to me, \"If praying hasn't stop- ped this, if I can't even call on God to make this stop, then what else is there that I can do?\" Just as in other crisis in- tervention, an appeal to God may at least bring personal com- fort and inner strength. It does not necessarily, however, stop the fire, the beating, or even the hurricane. (I realize that there are those who would challenge that statement and would be able to cite examples of when appeals to a Higher Source have apparently changed crisis situations. However, there have also been many faithful people who over the centuries have ap- pealed to God and most of them must still endure the crisis.) I fear that the practice of suggesting to vulnerable, frightened percipients that they can stop the phenomenon is creating an even more serious problem with which we will need to deal in the future. Eventually the abductee will realize that not only are the experiences ongoing, but also that the therapist has misled them. Another layer has thus been added to an already mind-numbing situation. Certainly we as therapists must inspect our own motivations to be absolutely sure that we are not creating an even greater problem for the people who come to us for help.

During the past three years I have investigated resistance techniques to ward off UFO abduction. I am reporting what I have found in my March 1992 Journal article, which Ms. Virginia Tilly finds so unacceptable. Anyone is free to disagree with any aspect of my work. This is how scientific knowledge advances. No one to date knows what abducting entities are, why they are here, or why they act as they do. We all try individually to make sense of the data which comes to our attention. Tilly states, or seems to state, that I agree abducting en- tities perform genetic experiments and interbreed humans. She's mistaken in this. There is as yet no proof that these ac- tivities are going on. There is also no documented proof of \"missing fetuses\" and \"implants\"; the only evidence for these is that witnesses report them. Her mention of Biblical accounts of heavenly visitors in- teracting with humans also does not apply. Accounts of heavenly visitors (and hellish visitors as well) describe com- pletely different creatures from abducting entities. The lat- ter therefore must be a separate order of creation from either angels or devils (demons). I do not suggest to \"vulnerable, frightened percipients\" that they can stop the phenomenon. I collect cases in which rather fearless individuals have been able to ward off the intruders on their own. Those percipients who come to my attention who seem fearless and who feel they have a right to resist violation are the ones I choose to work with and I might add, successfully. If Ms. Tilly prefers to believe that resistance can- not work, she has a perfect right to state her opinion.

Boylan, Ph.D. If you haven't yet made next summer's vacation plans, consider Dr. Boylan's recent itinerary. Just take an extra spare tire and don't say you weren't forewarned! B etween April 9 and 15 of this year, I conducted a per- sonal field investigation of several secret military- industrial sites where made-in-the-USA UFOs are allegedly designed, manufactured and flight-tested. This intense recon- naissance trip took me from California to Nevada, Arizona, New Mexico and Colorado. I travelled as a casually-dressed ordinary citizen in a four-wheel-drive vehicle with no special military or intelligence clearances. My interest in UFOs and accounts of joint government-EBE operations and technology transfers had been stimulated by my professional work as a clinical psychologist. Various per- sons began to show up in my caseload over the past three years who came into counseling for other reasons, but dur- ing the course of therapy revealed, or had flashback recall of, encounters and abduction by extraterrestrial beings. Earlier this year I had begun conducting a formal private research project, interviewing and debriefing persons with at least par- tial memory of a CE-IV experience. Hypnosis was used as necessary. So motivated, I determined to find corroborating evidence on this trip, if available, for the presence of UFOs and alien- human contact, primarily because my CE-IV contactees found it so hard to believe the reality of their visitation by EBE's; confirming data would provide helpful reassurance of their sanity. (Not to mention that of their therapist!) My first stop, on April 9, was Tonopah, NV, where I discovered that the U.S. Air Force Air Defense Command (ADC) maintains a headquarters, although the nearest \"of- ficial\" air base — Nellis — is on the edge of Las Vegas, 210 miles to the south. Strange, unless there is a secret aircraft base near Tonopah itself (there is). My next stop was approx- imately 15 miles east of Tonopah on U.S. 6, where a paved road leads south 25 miles through desert flats to the extremely secure Tonopah Test Range (TTR). Although this is where the Stealth F-117A fighters were kept until declassified, it is no longer an Air Force Base, having been taken over by the Department of Energy's weapons development and refinement organization, Sandia National Laboratories (SNL) of Albu- querque, which is one of the defense budget enterprises of AT&T. Sandia is heavily into Star Wars refinement, with nuclear fusion, electromagnetic pulse and particle beam Dr. Boylan is a licensed clinical psychologist living in Sacramento, CA, and a MUFON consultant. Needless to say, we cannot recommend his extracurricular activities to everyone! weapons, extreme magnetic fields, and laser research, among other things. Thus, SNL's Tonopah Test Range is conveniently located only 60 air miles from Area 51, where anti-gravity research has reportedly reached a high level of execution. I proceeded next towards the secret saucer test range at the Groom Lake (Area 51) and Papoose Lake (Area S4) com- plex. At Warm Springs, NV, I took State Highway 375 for 62 miles to Rachel, NV, where a number of the employees of Area 51 live. It is also home to the Little Ale Inn restaurant and bar, where flyers from Area 51 sometime stop in for a beer or two. The genial hosts, Joe and Pat Travis, have a veritable museum of UFO photos and lore on their walls. With precise directions from them and the assistance of my US Government Survey map (Pahranag'et Range, NV) of Groom and Papoose Lakes area, I drove about 24 miles southeast on Highway 375 to the infamous Black Mailbox which marks the intersection with the dirt road leading southwest to Area 51. It is 20 miles to Groom Lake base, but the military reser- vation boundary is five miles out from there. I drove 10 miles down the road (and was therefore still five miles from the military reservation boundary), when I passed a parked, un- marked Bronco with a light-bar on the roof. Two men were sitting inside wearing camouflage jumpsuits and no insignia, but armed. As I drove past I immediately noticed a pulling on my drive train. I stopped and got out, to discover that my rear tire on the side facing the Bronco was completely shat- tered. Although the tread was good, there was a sidewall punc- ture (courtesy of a silenced bullet?). As I started to change my tire, the camouflaged duo drove up and asked sarcastically, \"having any trouble?\" They probed as to whether I was headed \"up ahead,\" and whether I had a badge (photo ID). When I said no, they replied, \"No use going up there, you can't get in.\" I asked if there was a closed gate, and they replied affirmative. S ince I had learned earlier that security at Areas 51 and S4 is provided by EG&G and the Wackenhut Corpora- tions (with NSA and CIA ties), I concluded I was not going to get my rights to unhindered travel honored by these two. So I strategically retreated until nightfall. Under cover of darkness I again travelled down Groom Lake Road but stopped a half-mile short of where the armed duo's truck was parked. I set up binocular watch around 9.p.m., facing west and scanning just above the jagged ridgeline of the Groom Mountain Range. I was not disappointed. About 9:15 p.m. an intensely burning gold orb of light rose above the range, hovered, and glided slowly sideways. The intensity of the radiating light was directly proportional to the power demand of the maneuver being executed. Thus the orb grew extremely bright as it rose upward, and when it turned. After about four minutes the orb descended below the ridgeline. . About 9:40 p.m. a second orb of super-intense white light with bluish tones arose, reached an estimated height of 1500 feet, hovered, then drifted slowly south, then reversed and drifted north and hovered again. After this the craft began MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 292 August 1992"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"Any pilot in a conventional aircraft attempting such manuevers would have been slammed so hard against his seat as to lose consciousness. blinking and then began a series of maneuvers difficult to describe and almost defying the laws of physics. It jumped from one position to another, changing positions almost simultaneously over a distance of about 500 feet in two-thirds of a second, in a crazy quilt pattern of sideways, crisscrosses and ups and downs, in a random tic-tac-toe kind of sequencing. The craft kept up these split-second gyrations for several minutes in an incredible display of ability to defy inertia! and gravitational forces. No fighter plane could ever execute such maneuvers. None could turn so fast as to per- form right angle and direction-reverse maneuvers without any turning radius and so fast that the craft seemed almost to be in two positions at the same time. Any pilot in a conventional aircraft attempting such maneuvers would have been slammed against his seat and other restraints so hard as to be knocked unconscious, or at least left dizzy and faint from inertia! shifts. Clearly this craft is not reliant on the limitations of gravita- tional and inertial forces. The blue-white orb of light finally paused and hovered, and then began tracking downrange in a south-southwesterly direc- tion above the ridgetops. I followed it in binoculars for another 15 minutes or so before it finally became too small to view. About 10:20 p.m. another intensely burning, bright yellow- orange radiating orb arose above the Groom Range, and began blinking upon reaching the 1500-foot hovering height. This third craft did a rather modest bumble-bee-dance set of maneuvers when compared to the second, executing the turns rather slowly. It then went into a pulsing pattern, blinking once as a sharp distinct orb, followed by a second blink in which it appeared as a smeared patch of light. This one-two, one-two pattern persisted as it slowly proceeded downrange at perhaps ninety miles per hour. I followed it about 15 miles as well before it became indistinguishable from the stars. W hile I use the word orb to describe these burning- bright craft, I feel free to call them saucers because of corroborative information from two sources. The first is a telephoto photograph of a similar orb above Area 51 taken last year, enlarged and enhanced for detail, on display at the Little Ale Inn. The other source is Bob Lazar, a physicist formerly employed at Area S4. His description of the HPAC's (Human Powered Alien Craft) he claimed he helped build matches the telephoto picture of the gold orb seen over Areas 51 and S4. Lazar states that the HPAC's are powered by nuclear fusion. On April 11, I reconnoitered Los Alamos National Laboratories, a Department of Energy (DOE) complex at Los Alamos, NM, where the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory researches the relationship of magnetic and gravitational fields. On April 12,1 did reconnaissance on San- dia National Laboratories, another DOE complex, inside Kirtland Air Force Base, Albuquerque, where I learned that sustained nuclear fusion, magnetically contained, was achieved seven years ago. (Lawrence Livermore Laboratories in California is also heavily into nuclear fusion research us- ing lasers.) These labs conceivably provide much of the technical research for any human-powered, anti-gravitational craft. But the actual production takes place elsewhere. I headed west to California. Northeast of Los Angeles in the Antelope Valley portion of the Mojave Desert are the \"secret\" Black Budget aircraft production facilities of Lockheed (Helendale), McDonnell- Douglas (Llano) and Northrop. Northrop's facility is located on the huge Tejon Ranch in the Tehachapi Mountains, near the mouth of Little Oak Canyon. Here is where the Made- In-America flying saucers are purportedly built. I drove west of Lancaster on Highway 138 to 190th Street, turned north for three miles to the Los Angeles Kern County line, parked and got out my binoculars. Between 3-5 a.m. on April 16, I witnessed four short test flights of the seem- ingly same intensely-burning, bright yellow-orange orbs I had seen over Areas 51/S4. The first one lifted off around 3:15 a.m. On the ground it had looked like a parked passenger airliner in the dark, an elongated shape with a row of lighted panels like airline windows. As it began to power up and leave the ground, however, the entire frame began to emit powerful throbbing light. Even from seven miles away through crisp desert air, the light radiating from this saucer dazzled my eyes. After rising an estimated 500 feet in the air, the HPAC began to travel southwest about !/3 mile, then hover, then slowly fly back towards the Northrop plant. Approximately half an hour later a second intense orb of the same color lifted off. In all, 3 HPAC's were test-flown short hops from the southwest hangar area. A fourth one flew later from the northeast staging area in a due-East 1 A mile test loop. This appears to be production testing, with the lengthy field testing taking place at Area S4. The United States Black Budget military-weapons industry complex is theoretically assembling a fleet of U.S. saucers whose operational capabilities make the F-117A Stealth fighter look like a biplane. The purpose of this operation can only be guessed at. My hypothesis is that the Hawk elements in the military-intelligence community are preparing for an alien invasion by seeking to have equivalent spacecraft \"on our side\" for defense, or as part of a first-strike, coordinated with Star Wars electromagnetic-pulse and energy-beam weapons.

Stephen J. Brickner of the First Marine Divi- sion recalled that \"I was cleaning my rifle on the edge of my foxhole, when suddenly the air raid warning sounded ... I heard the formation before I saw it. Even then, I was puz- zled by the sound. It was a mighty roaring sound ... which didn't sound at all like the high-pitched sewing machine drone of the Jap formations. A few seconds later, I saw the forma- tion of silvery objects directly overhead.\" Brickner estimated that there were at least 150 craft ap- proaching. \"Instead of the usual tight 'V of 25 planes,\" he said, \"this formation was in straight, majestic lines of 10 to 12 objects, each behind the other.\" They were flying very high, too high for a bombing run. A closer look revealed that the objects were disc-shaped and faster than Japanese planes. No tails or fins were visible. The gleaming objects seemed to \"wobble slightly, and every time they wobbled, they would shimmer brightly from the sun,\" Brickner said. The reflect- ing glare of the tropical sun on the strange craft gave him the impression of highly polished silver. The formation disap- peared swiftly, leaving the excited witnesses open-mouthed. (Mysteries of the Skies by Gordon Lore, Jr., and Harold Deneault, Jr.) August 1952 • At 10:51 a.m. on the first, radar men at a Ground Control Intercept (GCI) post had spotted a fast-moving UFO. Apparently it was observing Wright-Patterson Air Force Base near Dayton, Ohio. About the same time the object was seen from the ground by several civilians near Bellefontaine, Ohio. It appeared to be round, with a shiny, metallic gleam. When the blips came on the scope, two F-86 jets were about 10 miles away from the disc. The two pilots, Major James B. Smith and Lieutenant Donald J. Hemer, were immediate- ly vectored toward the UFO. As Smith and Hemer reached 30,000 feet, they saw a bright, round, glowing object maneuvering above them. Both pilots switched on their gun- cameras and climbed at full power. At 40,000 feet the mysterious object was still above them. Pulling up at a sharp angle, Major Smith tried to get a pic- ture. But his F-86 stalled and fell off. When Hemer nosed up for a camera shot, the same thing happened. Then Major Smith, climbing again to 40,000 feet, made a second attempt. This time he was successful, and he clicked off several feet of film before the plane stalled. Then he quickly checked his telescopic gunsight and found it just covered the disc. But before he could get a closer look, the object quickly ac- celerated, disappearing at a tremendous speed. The gun-camera pictures showed a round object at least 12,000 feet away. Enlarged copies of the pictures showed on- ly a blurred round object. But that didn't lesson their import- ance. For the first time a UFO had been photographed dur- ing simultaneous radar and visual sightings, with the camera plane also locked on by radar.

They were tracked on radar, photographed, and were observed by the pilots of commercial airliners us- ing the National Airport. The whole dramatic story of that night was described in the Civil Aeronautics Administration Technical Development Report #180-CAA, entitled \"A Study of Unidentified Targets Observed on Air Traffic Control Radar.\" It shows how the UFOs maneuvered on the radar screens and lists the commercial planes and pilots involved in the events. (Strange World by Frank Edwards; The Jour- nal, Lorain, OH, 11/14/64) August 1957 • On the night of the 14th, a Varig C-47 cargo plane took off from Porto Alegre in Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, en route to Rio de Janeiro. At the controls were veteran pilot Commander Jorge Campos Araujo and his experienced co- pilot Edgar Onofre Scares. At 8:55 p.m. the aircraft, over the state of Santa Catarina, had passed Joinville five minutes before. At 6300 feet Scares spotted a luminous object far to the left of the plane. Suddenly, in a fast maneuver the object was ahead of them, then crossed to the right side, following a horizontal trajectory. It stopped for a moment and then abruptly went into a dive and was out of sight in the cloud- bank below. When the object reached the right side of the airliner, the engines of the plane began acting up, coughing and missing, and the lights in the cabin dimmed and almost went out; it seemed like the whole electrical system of the airliner was going to collapse. Besides the commander and co-pilot, radio operator Rubens A. Tortilho and stewards Jose D.S. Machado and Alfonso Schenini also observed the strange craft. All said the object was disc-shaped with a cupola or dome on top. The dome glowed with an intense green light and the flattened base showed a less intense yellowish luminosity.

Shortly before Capt.

At 10:30 a.m., the cows were about to jump over a low wall and Francois climbed up on a pile of stones whereupon he saw, on the other side of a hedge, about 40 meters (150 feet) away, what he thought were four children whom he did not recognize. They appeared strange; they and their clothing were completely black and had a silken look. Near the four figures was a large, extremely brilliant sphere which shone so much it was difficult to look at it. One of the small beings was bending over and seemed to be busying himself with something on the ground, while another, holding an object which reflected the sun like a mir- ror, waved his hands and seemed to be making signs to his companions. At this point Francois called out: \"Are you com- ing to play with us?\" At that moment the beings, who did not seem interested in the children, realized they were being watched. The first being flew up vertically and dived head first into the top of the sphere. The second followed him/her in the same manner and the third one, after standing up, did the same. The fourth being rose off the ground, came down again and caught up with the sphere which, during this time, had begun to rise by describing small circles and had reached a height of about 15 meters (50 feet). The fourth being then disappeared into the sphere in the same manner as the other three. As the sphere rose from the ground a low, fairly sharp hiss- ing noise was heard, mingled with a noise like a breeze blow- ing which neither of the children felt. The craft described a few more circles, still rising, and the intensity of the light emitted by the sphere increased greatly. Then the noise stopped and the sphere made off at full speed. At the same time that all of this was happening, a smell of sulphur was detected by the children. The children said the craft was about six feet in diameter and a very bright silver. The beings were about three and a half to four feet tall. The arms were long and slender, and no hands were noted. The legs were short and slender, and the feet of the fourth, when it caught up with the sphere, appeared to be webbed. The skull was pointed and the chin very marked. The nose was pointed and no eyes or mouth were evident. (The A.P.R.O. Bulletin, July/August 1968) August 1972 • John Burgess, 32 was terrified on the 22nd as he was chased by a UFO in England. \"I was driving from Spalding Home to Market Deeping when I saw a red light coming across the fields towards me,\" said Burgess. \"I'm one of those people who said flying saucers were a lot of codswallop anyway. But I soon changed my mind. The light came closer and closer. It was bright red. I slowed down to see what it was because by now it was obviously no aeroplane. As it zoomed up to within 200 yards of the road I saw that it was a vast globe-shape, 20 feet across. I proceeded to try and think what it might be. I rolled down the car windows but it was not some sort of freak reflection. It wasn't the moon, it was no higher than the treetops and it was moving. \"I stomped down on the accelerator and took off at 75 mph but I didn't shake it off, it just kept pace with me ... the faster I drove the faster it went, moving along beside me, flying over the fields. By now I was thoroughly scared and chain smoking as I drove. I slowed right down to 30 mph to see if it would take off. It slowed down with me.\" When John pulled up outside his house he was too frightened to leave the car because by now the sphere was circling the village above him. \"When I saw it zoom off towards Stamford I got out, shaking,\" he said. \"I don't care if people don't believe me. I know what I saw and I was frightened to death. It is an experience I will never forget.\" (The Evening Telegraph, Peterborough, England) August 1977 • A priest, a film director and a bank official were among startled witnesses who saw a glowing, oval- shaped UFO hover over a field in north-central Italy on the 12th. \"It was phosphorous-white in color with a green dome on top which flashed on and off, while the base gave off lights which dazzled us,\" recalled author and film director Pier Car- pi. \"It was solid and floating above the ground.\" Father Artemio Vezzosi, a priest in the parish of Villa Aiola, said: \"I'm not a UFO fan. I do God's work and I'm not given over to fantasy, but I can't explain what I saw. The night was clear, starlit, not a breath of wind. Like the others, I could see this shining mass, like a cloud, only much better defined. It was about four inches above the grass, above five feet tall, 13 feet in diameter and it was undulating in this field.\" Witnesses were stunned by a bright light as if it had sud- denly become daylight. They rushed from the local church hall and found the object, radiating light, just down the road in an open field. Bank official Giancarlo Ferretti ran toward the glowing mass. \"He was thrown backwards,\" Capri said. \"I heard him cry out, 'Leave me alone!' as he was lifted up in the air and flew backward about 20 feet.\" Said artist and factory worker, Antonio Bedini, \"We saw him fall. It was oval-shaped ... we were all scared ... we didn't know what it was.\" Ferretti himself didn't know what hit him. \"As I went toward this luminous object, I felt myself pulled back by a violent force. People say I fell between 20 and 30 feet backwards, but I wasn't aware of this.\" Awestruck, the witnesses withdrew to return to the church for a camera to take photographs of the UFO. They had only gone a short distance before it simply disappeared.

Unless noted, no sound, odor or vibration was detected. All times are local. • Log09112DE: On September 15, 1991, at 2p.m., a 32-year- old contractor and his wife reported that a dark, flat object with protrusions like tree branches and an object shaped like a bow-tie were observed in Gulf Breeze, FLfor 10-12 minutes; investigator Joe Barron. The objects came from the south, stopped nearly overhead, spiraled slowly down to 2-300 feet above the ground, shot up very quickly, and then repeated the spiraling motion. The motion seemed deliberate, as if they wanted to be observed. At the closest point, the large object appeared as wide as both hands at arm's length. The con- tractor called his wife who got good triangulation data from 350 feet farther west. The large object was calculated to be about 64 feet across. It shot straight up \"very high,\" stopped again, and then went very fast to the north. It stopped again and then sped straight down toward the water about a mile away. The small object stayed for a short time, and then drifted toward the north slowly until it went behind the trees. • Log #920201E: About September 1981, a young bride was returning home at 3 a. m. with her husband, near Lithia, FL, when a UFO hovered about 50 feet over their car; investigator Fearon L. Hicks, Jr. Two lights on the UFO, which looked like an approaching car, were seen for some distance before the UFO lifted up and hovered over their car. They stopped, leaned out the windows, and saw an undefined silvery object covering the roadway and the power lines along the side. Her next recollection is waking up in bed the next morning. She had a rash on her left arm, neck, and the side of her chest. The area where the rash was still becomes dark red when exposed to heat, but does not cause discomfort. The witness's sister also suspects UFO encounters. • Log #920203E: On January 19, 1991, at 8:30p.m. a 31-year- old respiratory therapist in Bridgeport, CTsaw a UFO hover- ing over and slightly beyond a 35-foot tree across the street and about 360 feet away; investigators Anastasia Wietr- zychowski and Bob Elmore. The object was a domed disk with a large square \"window\" on the upper portion emitting brilliant white light. Two smaller \"windows\" emitted dim- mer white light, and the object appeared to be outlined by white light. A truck passed, backed up and stopped. The light disappeared and reappeared in another location. The witness observed this for about 30 seconds through a glass door while talking on the phone, and static was reported. • (No Log Number) A February 10, 1992, 5:10p.m. event; in- vestigated by Craig Grundy, State Section Director in Ogden. Three children, a nine-year-old girl and two boys, age 10 and 11, were playing in a field near their homes in the small town of Willard, Utah, north of Ogden. They heard a strange sound and, looking up, saw a disk-shaped object about 10 feet in diameter swaying at tree-top height across the road. They said it was a dull metallic gray color with a lighted dome, topped with what looked like an antenna. They stood still, watching the disk until it \"took off real fast\" to the north. The father, who called in the sighting, said he was convinced the children were telling the truth because they were so excited and weren't prone to make up stories. As one mother said, \"My boy is not that good an actor.\" Crop Circle Update Michael Chorost, MUFON's crop circle consultant and the director of Project Argus, called Walt Andrus from England on the night of August 9 to offer a brief up- date. After an inauspicious start, circles have now begun appearing in the vicinity of Alton Barnes, where Argus is headquartered, at the rate of two to three a day. In all, more than 150 circles have formed within a 20-mile radius of Alton Barnes. Project Argus per- sonnel have been able to collect soil and crop samples from some 40 to 50 formations this summer, a full analysis of which will not be available until later in the year. Five circles were reported on August 9 alone, three of which had formed the night before. Dumbbell shapes predominated during the past week. One series of circles, connected by an intersecting straight line, was more than 110 meters in length. Numerous other groups were in the field as well, including that of Steven Greer, director of CSETI, the Center for the Study of Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence, of North Carolina. Greer and other CSETI members claim to have seen a structured craft some 80 feet in diameter. Other people have reported other luminous nocturnal phenomena. Since the fields are now being harvested, Chorost will be returning to the U.S. on the 19th of the month. MUFON, which contributed $2500 to the expenses of Project Argus, will eventually receive a full report of this summer's crop circles activities.

I think that all Journal readers were affected one way or another by the story several issues back of MUFON members converging on the nation's capital and mounting a good old-fashioned street demonstration in front of the White House demanding \"End The UFO Coverup.\" I cer- tainly understand the motivations of my colleagues who made that effort, born of the frustration of several decades of official stonewalling and deceit, and appreciate their suc- ceeding in an orderly and dignified manner in getting their message before the president and some portion of the public. This event started me thinking about the nature of demonstration and confrontation between a people and their government, and its applicability to the \"flying saucer problem.\" Actually, I perceive mat the group within our government/military establishment that has set itself up to deal with this issue faces two intractable, interrelated pro- blems: the first is that it is obvious even to outsiders that the tasks of intelligence gathering/analysis, and attempts at management or containment of these flying objects and their occupants, pursued diligently since the mid-1940s, has not exactly met with any sparkling success. The second problem is simply that they have lied about it to the public for decades, covered it up and even mounted counter- intelligence operations against the people of this country and the world, which have for the most part been rather successful in deflecting or diluting civilian, scientific and even congressional inquiry into the subject. Getting out from under this latter problem must be a no-less depress- ing prospect than admitting defeat in the former. At this point in history, I wonder if confrontation be- tween organized civilians cognizant of the flying saucer phenomenon, and their government (only a small, secretive, probably \"inbred\" portion of which is genuinely cognizant) is likely to be at all productive. I'm thinking that cooperation rather than confrontation would be our mutual benefit, and I'm looking for signs that either side is willing to begin cooperating. What would the \"buffs,\" as we are labeled despite our professional or academic credentials, have to offer? For one thing, we serve as ex- amples that people from all walks of life can know what we do (accurate or not) about the flying saucers and their effects on people, either through personal encounters with, or independent study of the phenomenon, and live with that knowledge for years or decades without becoming dysfunctional due to fear or worry. Surely those struggling with the problem of how to integrate this denied knowledge into the general public's consciousness can make use of this sizeable experience. Secondly, it would seem that those who have shown an innate and abiding interest in the sub- ject might just function at a higher level of motivation and diligence than those merely assigned or \"detailed\" to pur- sue what must appear to be an endless and insoluable pro- blem, whose sensitivity precludes their even receiving recognition for their effort. Thirdly, it's just possible that those individuals and families who seem to have attracted the concentrated attention of the phenomenon may have in- sights to offer as to its ultimate nature and future course, if only they could be more openly involved in multidisciplin- ary studies to \"read between the lines\" of their varied and misleading experiences, something that cannot be efficiently pursued in an atmosphere of secrecy, denial and ridicule. Confrontation in the street or cooperation across the con- ference table; which shall it be? And who will make the next move? — Jerold R. Johnson Austin, Texas How To Make An Ice-Ring This is hi reference to the \"Charles River Ice Ring\" article by Raul Rosenfield in the April 1992 Journal. A most in- teresting story and an excellent example of the observa- tional skills and follow-up that are so important to an understanding of what may be a natural process or side ef- fect of mankind's activities (pipelines, pollution, etc.). But, of course, there are two other distinct possibilities. The first is that the ice ring may be a part of the \"visitation scenario\" with UFOs, coverups, and all that that implies. Perhaps, and I can't rule that out, but neither can I bring anything useful to bear directly on that possibility. The remaining possibility for the production of this ice ring pattern is a hoax. And I agree that production of the pattern from the top is not practical given the conditions stated in the article. With ice that may or may not be safe, with no tracks, no handy branches overhanging the circle, etc. the thought of someone causing this from above stret- ches the imagination. How about from beneath the surfaces of the water/ice? How would I attempt to produce this pattern if I wanted to fool folks? Consider an energy transducer that could be planted us- ing simple diving equipment in the warm water of say the previous August or September. Such a device that produces either a standing wave pattern of concentric circles or a direct heat shadow pattern in the forming ice. Standing wave patterns could be produced by acoustic energy (ever watch a glass of water on a vibrating surface produce circular rings when things are just right?) or possibly by the \"near field\" effects of a low power radio transmitter aimed from below. A direct shadow pattern could be from a heat lamp in an underwater enclosure pointing up with a shadow mask to produce the concentric rings. Heat problems would be nil with all that river water around acting as a heat sink. For my pick as the easiest way to hoax this I would use a medium power speaker in an underwater enclosure with perhaps a hundred watt amplifier on shore next to my easy MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 292 August 1992"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"chair, next to a convenient window overlooking the river. The connecting cable out to the bottom of the river would be large but not impossible. The speaker would be pointing straight up and after some experimenting with the proper frequency tone in the wee hours of a Fall night I think I could produce standing waves on the surface of the water. Then I would shut off my amplifier and wait a few weeks for the first ice to start to form before I started to give it . the acoustic treatment in earnest. After my artwork froze into place I would wait for the first ice break-up and just troll in my equipment. The above implies that those living in the houses visible in the photo might be prime hoax suspects. I couldn't resist checking the local City Directory to see what they might list as their backgrounds. But not being local I will leave this to someone else closer to check. I welcome comments from the author and would be pleased to learn the actual facts should they become known. — David A. Bodner, PE Syracuse, NY Battle Over Belgium UFOs In his letter published in the MUFON UFO Journal of April 1992, Steven M. Greer, Director of the Center for the Study of Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence (CSETI), tells of his trip to Belgium and his meetings with several leading SOBERS members involved with the investigations of the recent Belgian UFO flap. His inquiries left him with an impression that was very different from what I wrote in my article \"Triangles over Belgium\" (MUJ, Feb. 1992). When Dr. Greer claims that \"SOBEPS is without a doubt the most scientific, credible and professional general UFO research organization in the world today\" then this tells us more about the general state of affairs in ufology than it does about the research capacities of SOBEPS itself. In fact, the \"truly top-notch\" scientists that Dr. Greer is referring to number no more than three: First, we have Prof. Auguste Meessen, whose published work on UFOs is not endorsed by his colleagues (I already pointed out in my article how the professor's biased approach has led him away from the truth on earlier occasions). Second- ly, there is the French physicist Dr. Jean-Pierre Petit, a man who has always displayed a passionate desire to ap- pear on radio and television, this time to promote the ex- travagant idea that beings from the planet UMMO are liv- ing among us (even SOBEPS has recently decided to reconsider its collaboration with Petit). Thirdly, SOBEPS can rely on the help of Dr. Leon Brenig, a physicist who is a newcomer to ufology and is one of the very few SOBEPS collaborators who does not openly endorse the ET hypothesis but apparently tries to keep an open mind. Dr. Greer is also impressed by the quality of the evi- dence that the Belgian flap produced and refers to the radar tapes of March 30-31, 1990 and to a photograph taken at Petit- Rechain in April of that same year. Both documents are in- deed regarded by many as the best evidence that some- thing out of the ordinary was chasing through our skies between 1989 and 1991. About the radar tapes it should suffice to say that a sec- ond analysis has been conducted by members of the Belgian military school, but that a press conference about its results has been postponed on several occasions. It is rumored that the outcome of this independent analysis is very different from Prof. Meessen's findings. Fact is that several investigators suspect an instrumental malfunction and reportedly Meessen himself now considers the possibility of a ground-based object as the cause of the unusual radar returns (whereas he first emphasized that these could only be explained in terms of ET technology). It should also be reported that these radar observations are not in good agreement with the recorded visual sightings. About the transparency taken at Petit-Rechain, one should not forget that results from a full analysis have not yet been published. Furthermore, many elements of this case are missing, some are even suspect. Not only did the photographer throw away a second slide \"because there was nothing on it,\" he also kept the \"UFO slide\" in a drawer for four months despite the fact that all the media at that time were covering the news of the F-16 chase that had occured only a few days earlier. Contradictions be- tween the statements given by the two witnesses (a young man and his 18-year-old girlfriend) are also apparent and the up-standing position of the triangular shape in the pic- ture is unusual to say the least. Furthermore, the trans- parency contains no background information which allow verification of the object's actual size and distance. In an attempt to duplicate the picture, I have been able to obtain all the so-called \"anomalies\" in the Petit-Rechain slide with the use of a blue and black piece of cardboard, a pair of scissors and a set of lamps (see enclosed photographs). It should also be noted that the copyright owner and dis- coverer of the slide is an acquaintance of the prime witness and asks a lot of money from anyone who wishes to pub- lish the document in question. Finally, the exact day of the purported sighting is unknown, which makes meteorolog- ical and astronomical verifications impossible. Clearly this case does not constitute good proof. It is not our impression, nor that of any of the UFO groups in our country that the Belgian flap continued un- abated until after June 1991. In a TV debate broadcast on June 17, 1992, Michel Bougard, Chairman of SOBEPS, even mentioned April 1991 as the end of the flap. Finally, in his own article, \"UFOs over Belgium,\" which appeared in the May 1992 Journal, Greer makes some glaring errors: There are not 3,500 reported sightings, but only between 1,500 and 2,000 (according to Bougard in a published interview dated May 16, 1992). The location of the first series of sightings is not Eupan but Eupen and, no one here has ever heard of any \"presently inactive volcanic sites\" in our country. — Wim Van Utrecht Antwerp, Belgium MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 292 August 1992"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"Ice Ring: Part II Some comments regarding Paul Rosenfield's article on the Charles River ice ring (MUPON UFO Journal, April 1992). Circles on ice are not very common and I have only in- vestigated two similar circles in Sweden. Both of them formed in rivers where the current under the ice was the direct cause of their formation. The largest of the two, of which I supply a photo, was 50 meters in diameter and rotated steady as a clock. Every turn the central ice core touched the surrounding ice, slow- ly making a perfect circle. The ice circle was so thick that is was possible to drive a snow scooter on it while it was rotating. This hydrological phenomenon has no name and the Swedish meteorological and hydrological institute knows only of three or four other places in Sweden where similar rotating circles have formed. The underwater current that forms the circle can be quite slow. Typically the formation begins just before the ice gets too thick, but at first it can be very difficult to see. Snow, of course, can hide the ring for a while before it starts rotating. However, not all circles start to rotate: the current can be too weak or the ice too thick. All circumstances must be right for the formation and this makes these rings so rare. The other ring I have investigated looked quite similar to the Charles River circle since that one never broke free and did not start to rotate. I don't know if this is the solution for the Charles River ice ring but I think that it is highly probable. What this does imply — and here I use the words of Paul Fuller, editor of The Crop Wztcher — is that nature can and does produce precisely-defined geometrical traces without the need of ah'en intervention. — Clas Svahn Chairman, UFO-Sweden Vallingby, Sweden Award Thanks Thank you very much for the 1991-1992 MUFON Award honoring work which has contributed to advancing the study of the complex UFO phenomena. The Albuquerque Conference called it \"the ultimate mystery of the millen- nia.\" I know it's the most difficult subject I've ever encountered. Each year since producing the 1979 documentary film A Strange Harvest, I have struggled to find clarity in the mystery. In that struggle amid crosscurrents of eyewitness testimonies, suppressed truths, manipulation and misinfor- mation, I am humbly grateful if I have been able to share any constructive insights. As the centuries change this decade, I hope we all will share in a global shift toward understanding the new cosmology that is emerging which includes other life forms and other dimensions.

Webb September 1992 • Bright Planets (Evening Sky): Venus (magnitude -3.9) is slowly pulling away from the Sun's glare low in the W, setting 114 hours after sunset by month's end. Our bright planetary neighbor resides near the slim crescent Moon on the 28th. Mars (0.4), crossing from Taurus into Gemini, now rises in the NE about 11:30 PM daylight time in mid-September. Also at mid-month the U.S.'s first Mars mission in 17 years is expected to thunder off a Cape Canaveral launch pad atop a Titan III booster. Called Mars Observer, the un- manned spacecraft will orbit the red planet for two Earth years, surveying the little world in great detail and in several wavelengths. Saturn (0.4), retrograding in Capricornus, can be found low in the SE at dusk. From there, it moves westward across the southern sky during the night. • Bright Planets (Morning Sky): Mars stands high in the SE at dawn. The planet is only about 1° above the quarter Moon on September 20. Jupiter ( — 1.7) becomes visible in the early morning sky at month's end, rising in the E some 40 minutes before the Sun at that time. Saturn sets in the WSW about 3 AM in mid-September. • Moon Phases: First quarter — Sept. 3 ^) Full moon — Sept. 11 (Harvest Moon) Last quarter — Sept. 19 New Moon — Sept. 26 • The Stars: During the midevening hours in midmonth the sky is evenly split between the summer stars in the western half and the autumn constellations in the eastern half. The fall season's celestial symbol, the Great Square of Pegasus, is easily visi- ble in the east while the summer symbol, the Summer Triangle, remains high in the SW. For rural skywatchers, the Milky Way now passes directly overhead from NE to SW, its best evening appearance of the year. Be aware of the following midevening bright stars low enough in the sky to be subject to atmospheric refraction effects and therefore false UFO reports: Arcturus (in the WNW), An- tares (WSW), Fomalhaut (SE), and Capella (NE).

After demonstrating in Albuquerque the UFO instrumen- tation devices that he has built, Wesley E. Ellison, B.S.E.E. (Baldwin City, KS) was appointed to the MUFON Staff as the Specialist in Instrumentation. By the action of the MUFON Board of Directors the resignation of Dan Wright as Deputy Director, Investigations, was reluctantly accepted. Dan has launched a very ambitious program to transcribe ab- duction audio tapes under the sponsorship of MUFON. In this capacity he will report to John S. Carpenter, MUFON Director for Abduction Research, in the organizational structure. New MUFON Amateur Radio Net Leslie H. Varnicle (WA3QLW), Amateur Radio Director, has announced the inauguration of a new 20 meter net that meets every Thursday on 14.264 plus or minus 3 Khz at 0200 UCT (8 p.m. Eastern Standard or Daylight Time). The Net Control Station is WB2GAJ. Eighteen stations checked into the net on July 16th from across the U.S.A. As the informa- tion spreads about this new net, we can expect more U.S.A. and foreign country stations to check in. UFO Museums Opening in April 1992 in its new location, the Roswell UFO Enigma Museum has already had over 400 visitors. This does not include the influx of people attending the MUFON 1992 Symposium in nearby Albuquerque who stopped by to see the beautiful panoramic view of the famed Roswell UFO crash. John A. Price and his wife Sharon operate the museum as a wing to their \"Outa Limits Video Store\" at 6010 S. Main Street, adjacent to the main gate of the former Walker Air Force Base (Roswell AAF). In reality, the crash depicted is more like the object and bodies of the San Agustin Plains incident related by Stanton Friedman, Don Berliner, Gerald Anderson, and Barney Barnett in the new book Crash at Corona. The museum was featured in the July 5, 1992 edi- tion of the Albuquerque Journal. If you are traveling through New Mexico on vacation, I can personally recommend that you include a visit to the Roswell UFO Enigma Museum on your itinerary. For those members who are planning a vacation trip to Disney world, a new UFO museum opened on July 17, 1992 at 11955 S. Orange Blossom Trail, Suite #1144, Orlando, Florida. It is an adjunct to the retail store International U.F.O. Center, operated by James S. Greenan, local State Section Director. The grand opening is scheduled in conjunction with National UFO Information Week on August 9, 1992. Another UFO crash museum is being organized in Roswell, New Mexico by action of the City Council to recognize this historical event. Spearheaded by Walter Haut (P.I.O.) and Glen Dennis (mortician), principals in the famous Roswell crash, the location will be in a former church building on 8th Street near downtown Roswell. Please give the commit- tee adequate time to assemble their museum before schedul- ing a visit. The MUFON Board of Directors authorized a donation of one copy to each of our symposium proceedings from 1975 through 1992 to each of these museums for display purposes. MUFON literature is also available in each of the two exist- ing museums for the convenience of visitors. John Price and James Greenan are to be congratulated for their ambitious efforts in behalf of UFO public education. Our best wishes are extended to the City of Roswell for their non-profit organization museum.

Format Revisions in Journal The MUFON Board of Directors approved proposed revi- sions in the format of the MUFON UFO Journal at their July 12th Annual Corporate Board Meeting in Albuquerque, NM. In order to allow more space for the \"Current Cases\" or \"Current Case Log\" column authored by the three Regional Directors and the Canadian National Director, the very popular \"Looking Back\" by Bob Gribble and \"In Others' Words\" by Lucius Parish will be phased out in future issues. Since MUFON is basically an investigative organization, it is imperative that our readers are made aware of the signifi- cant UFO reports of a current nature. Even though Bob Grib- ble's historic sightings were of considerable interest, especially to newcomers, this will provide Bob more time to process and report current investigations from his Western Region for the expanded column. The Board also approved short classified ads as a service to members and readers as a new innovation, but rejected ac- cepting display ads, adhering to a 25-year policy of SKYLOOK and MUFON UFO Journal. The editor, Dennis Stacy, will define the rules and costs of classified ads. Ads will be monitored by both the Editor and Associate Editor for appropriateness and good taste before publishing. A state- ment of policy and disclaimer will be published in the Jour- nal as it relates to classified ads.
