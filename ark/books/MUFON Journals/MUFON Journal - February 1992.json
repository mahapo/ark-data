I was investigating the reports of sightings associated with a Northrop Skunkworks facility in the Tehachapi Mountains on the north side of the valley when I heard about two witnesses who had experiences of missing time. These two women, Pam and Jackie, lived within eyeball range of the facility and had experienced a number of strange events. In addition, Jackie, who could see the facility clearly from her property in the high desert, reported two daylight sightings. In each case she contends that she witnessed a large disk as- cend from the facility and move eastward along the base of the Tehachapis. Construction workers have informed me that the facility itself has several underground levels. On the evening of May 14, 1991, Pam had her strangest en- counter ever. Shortly after 11:00 p.m. she reports that three \"grays\" appeared by her bedside and started to lift her off the bed. She lives in a large, custom-built pentagonal desert home that has one large room without partitions. The kit- chen, bedroom and living room are open to one another. She started to struggle with the grays — the four-and-a-half-foot category — when she spotted a human in the living room area. A man, dressed all in black, was holding a device that resembled a small TV and dan- gling a cord. Pam heard the man say, \"you have no electricity.\" At this point she somehow freed herself from the entities and went to grab a light cord that would switch on a light from her twelve-volt system. The light would not come on. She then yelled for her husband to awaken. Events then took a bizarre turn. Hearing her 100-pound Labrador barking in the yard, she and her husband went to the north-facing kitchen window. Her attention was drawn to a man who lay prone on a pro- jecting part of the roof near a ladder. The man was dressed in full-dress Air Force blues. The three grays were now on the ground below the man as well as a K-9 sentry dog that was poised to attack Pam's dog, Casey. In the sky over the yard there were a number of red lights. The man yelled to the grays, \"get her out of the house,\" while Pam yelled back, \"don't kill my dog.\" In the wake of this panic, Pam next remembers standing alone outside and behind their generator shack. The man, the dog, the grays, and her husband were no longer in sight. Red lights were revolving above her and a thick fog was emanating from ports set around the large craft hovering above. Her next memory was that of awakening, seated on her bed at 3:50 a.m. I had arrived at Pam's place the next morning and spent SKYWATCHERS FLOCK TO ANTELOPE VALLEY all day with her. That evening we had a local certified hyp- notherapist, Miranda Cunha, regress Pam through the inci- dent. We discovered a mental block in the missing time period. A few tidbits emerged from this session. It seems Pam believes that she may have been taken to a base inside the Tehachapis (the second case that reported this) and that she was cautioned not to reveal what she knows. She felt very threatened by this incident. This is just a brief recounting of only one of Pam's en- counters, but significant for its mention of human involve- ment and its disturbing implications. Pam is a good observer and very precise about her experiences. Jackie reports see- ing Pam's yard enveloped in a fog that same night, but does not remember seeing the lights which may have been directed downward and obscured by the fogscreen put out by the ob- ject. Since that night Pam has also been buzzed by low-flying helicopters. One military helicopter hovered less than a hun- dred feet over her yard. Her yard comprises two-and-a-half acres of desert property. Since there have been some remarkable sightings over this area during the year and Pam's account raises many ques- tions, I would like to proceed by relating other events that enlarge the scope considerably. On May 28th, the night of a full moon, I went to a certain observation area in the Antelope Valley just west of the city of Lancaster and south of the Nor- thorp facility in the Tehachapi mountain range. Joined by three other observers we saw our first aerial light emerge at the crest of the mountains south of us. The light was white with an amber tinge. It moved west above the mountain ridge, reached a cer- tain point, then started strobing fluorescent red and white lights. As it continued to move west, then northwest, it began to jump and dance in erratic movements. When it reached the far end of the west valley I could see a silhouette against the twilight blue sky. The object appeared to be boomerang- shaped with several strobe lights dancing around its perimeter. This object suddenly and instantaneously vanished. A sec- ond and third object appeared above the same mountains and followed roughly the same pattern of activity except that they continued on their course to disappear in the distance. The wild \"jumpers\" were sometimes so erratic that normal air- craft could not withstand the structural stresses that would result from such rapid changes in motion. On the following night, with thirteen other witnesses gathered at our desert observation post, I viewed a spectacular light show starting in the same way as the previous night.

MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 286 February 1992"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Researchers and abductees (including Pam and Jackie) were present. We saw between 25 and 30 objects. Several of these danced and zig-zagged at all compass 1 directions. One or two of the objects also disappeared when in clear view. In addition to the strobing jumpers, we saw what ap- peared to be a large craft manuevering to the east. It appeared to be triangular with a steady fluorescent red light on the right and an aquamarine-colored light on its left tip. This object flew both forwards and backwards as well as gliding silently sideways. It turned and tilted until it came to the south end of the street as if it were peering at us. It then tilted on its edge and turned to proceed back to its point of origin. I snapped four photos at that instant, but the lights failed to register on 1000 ASA Ektar film. This light show lasted two-and-one-half hours. At one point two Air Force jets crossed from northwest to southeast and returned, but did not attempt to close with any of the UFOs. N earby Palmdale is the site of a major L. A. Air Traf- fic Control center as well as several aerospace facilities and Air Force Plant 42. Edwards AFB is a few miles to the north, near the town of Rosamond. Yet no aircraft were sent out to intercept these strange aerial objects! I phoned Edwards AFB Public Affairs Office the next day and the officer on duty was extremely interested in our sightings, but could offer no immediate explanation for them except to say that he was aware that the Antelope Valley had several secret projects that may involve advanced technology aircraft and that he had no access to that sort of information. We feel that the people on these secret projects are well aware of what is flying in the skies over Lancaster. In the early morning hours of July 25th, Pam and I were watching the valley skies as we had made it a sort of ritual during the warm summer nights. At 12:45 a.m. a string of gold-colored lights approached silently and rapidly from the west, moving east. The golden lights were surrounded by a coronal field that may have been ionized layers of plasma. Some of this \"plasma\" appeared to be shedding from its source and trailing behind. As the string reached the city limits of Lancaster, the lights disappeared one by one. At least two other sighting parties were viewing this same light string from separate locations. One of the other parties had a camcorder and starlight scope and videotaped this procession of lights. I have a VMS copy of the tape. When one of the other witnesses mentioned the starlight scope and its ability to enhance night photography to his neighbor, his neighbor bought one and on the night of August 1st tested its ability to record the passage of an airliner over downtown Lancaster. To his surprise a small lighted object appeared and raced around the airliner, executing a sharp- angled, high-speed fly around and then faded out against the background stars. I also have this segment on video and have shown it on San Diego's ABC affiliate Channel 10 which did a special report on UFOs on their nightly news in late October. One of the most spectacular sightings occurred on November 4th. While driving to work in the morning, Pam spotted a triangular shape over the Antelope Valley Freeway (Highway 14) at 7:11 a.m. It gave off a bright flash of gold and green. She was headed south on 60th Street west when the triangular object appeared. She then entered the freeway traveling south toward Lancaster. At 7:18 a.m. a very large charcoal-black, arrowhead-shaped vehicle passed over her pickup truck which was headed north and passing over the Avenue H overpass. It had no windows or openings. Run- ning the whole length of the bottom of the craft was a tubular structure. The craft had no vertical stabilizers and made no sound. It was traveling very slow. She estimated its altitude as 300 to 500 feet (very low) and its dimensions as a football field in length (300 ft.) and as wide as the freeway, including the central corridor and pullovers (about 80 ft.) She exited at Avenue I and pulled into an ARCO station and quickly jumped out to look for the object. The object was nowhere in sight. There have been other peculiar activities and light shows reported to me from the east side of the valley. Some of these sightings are in the vicinity of another secret underground facility owned by the McDonnell-Douglas Corporation. Near this facility is El Mirage Dry Lake and Shadow Mountain. A team of skywatchers from Victorville has seen many strange balls of light and one huge lighted craft near Shadow Mountain. They have also reported seeing an identical string of lights on several occasions similar to the one we viewed on July 25th. Another abduction case was reported in the Victorville area. The abductee, Diane, reports being taken to an underground facility jointly occupied by grays and men in Air Force uniforms. A Victorville psychotherapist is doing extensive work on this case. If we take these reports seriously and do not dismiss them as a product of the witness's imagination, then there are significant implications in the content of such reports. The few informants from the Aerospace sector who have approached me have done little more than cautiously con- firm the existence of these underground areas, the reality of the alien presence, and verified advanced technology projects. I am not advocating a wholesale belief in any conspiracy scenario nor do I believe all the tales I hear, but I am ad- vocating a need for further careful and cautious investigation based on eyewitness testimony. The light shows over Lancaster continue. The \"jumpers\" are still seen frequently. Skywatchers are flocking to the Antelope Valley in hopes of seeing UFOs.

The event marked the beginning of one of Europe's biggest \"UFO flaps\" ever. In the early stages, most of the reports emanated from the eastern regions of Belgium. But in the course of the months that followed, other parts of the country, and especially the areas around Brussels and Liege, also became the seat of unusual observations. Because of certain sensational aspects, the flap caught the attention of news agencies in all corners of the world. Jour- nalists were impressed by the fact that there had been several occasions on which jet-fighters had taken off in an attempt to identify inexplicable lights. Equally exceptional: policemen, military personnel and scientists also claimed to have seen the unknown objects manoeuvring through the sky. Further- more, almost all witnesses unanimously spoke of triangular platforms with bright, white lights in each corner and a red, pulsating light in the middle. As for the physical evidence, the sky watches had produced dozens of photographs and approximately 30 video-films. Aside from this, a handful of radar tapes had been made available for analysis. By the spring of 1990, the situation was such that many Belgians spent long hours outdoors, hoping to catch a glimpse of the bizarre craft. But perhaps the most unique aspect of all was the collaboration that had been set up between the national Royal Air Force and a Brussels-based UFO group named SOBERS* As UFO reports kept pouring in for more than a year and a half, the popularity of SOBERS increased at an equivalent pace. Interviews with members of the group were published in almost every journal and magazine in the country. Usual- ly the group's address and phone number were given in case readers wanted to report a personal experience. On radio and television, ufologists answered questions about the possibility of an alien presence in our skies. On two occasions, first in December 1989 and again in June of 1990, the U.S. Air Force assured our Ministry of Defense that the F-1T7A Stealth fighter — believed by some investigators to be at the heart of the sightings — \"has never flown in the European theater.\" This leaves unanswered, of course, the question of whether some other Stealth platform might have. All this time the scien- tific community kept silent, with the exception of some weather-prophets, who tried to calm down the situation by speaking of inversion layers and sea plankton ... Under these circumstances, speculation and suggestion were given free play and it did not take long before almost any light in the sky which could not be readily identified was labeled a * SOBERS - Societe Beige d'Etude des Phenomenes Spatiaux (Belgian Society for the Study of Space Phenomena): Avenue Paul Janson 74, B-1070, Bruxelles, Belgium. UFO. People who had never made a habit of looking skywards were now surprised by the variety of luminous phenomena that could be seen in the course of a single night. As months went by it became clear that the popularity of SOBERS had strong- ly influenced the course of events. Twenty years ago, a similar situation had occurred when the publicity following the in- itial creation of SOBERS set fire to a local outburst of UFO reports. Conceivably, the wave of sightings that was now flooding the country would never have had the same magnitude if the group had not been promoting it so vigourously. By the spring of 1991 things had quieted down a little and SOBERS announced that a detailed report about the events would soon be published. On October 17, a book more than 500 pages thick was presented to the press. The title read: Vague d'OVNIsur la Belgique - Un dossier exceptionel (UFO Flap over Belgium - An Exceptional File). The book was sold out in no time. T he introduction to the SOBERS book is written by Dr. Jean-Pierre Petit, Director of a research division at the French Centre National de Recherche Spatial (CNRS- National Center for Space Studies). Further scientific contribu- tions included papers by Auguste Meessen, Professor in physics at the Universite Catholique de Louvain and Leon Brenig, physicist at the Universite Libre de Bruxelles. SOBEPS associates Bougard, Clerebaut, Vertongen and Ferryn signed most of the other chapters. Major-general Wilfried de Brouwer wrote the postscript of the book. As an aviator, de Brouwer had coordinated a sky watch during which, for the first time in history, ufologists and airmen joined forces. The authors almost unanimously concluded that, in view of the evidence, the extraterrestrial hypothesis seemed the most likely solution. Naturally, this was too much to swallow for the scientific com- munity in our country. On October 26, 1991, the newspaper La Wallonie noted the following news: at the instance of astrophysicist Andre Lausberg, ten Belgian scientists had signed a declaration in which the SOBEPS report was heavily criticized. Professor Meessen and Dr. Petit were especially reprimanded for their rash statements and pseudo-scientific approach. In a way, the scientific community had set up a tribunal that would deal with members who were supposedly feeding pseudo-scientific in- formation to the public. While highly respected by European ufologists, Meessen and Petit may not be household names to most overseas readers, so some background information may be in order. Before he launched himself into the investigation of the Belgian UFO flap, Professor Meessen had already written Wim van Utrecht directs the Groep Voor Vreemde Luchtverschjjnselen (Group for the Study of Strange Aerial Phenomena) in Antwerpen (Antwerp), Belgium.

Although written in an academic style, Meessen's work is almost entirely based on unverified witness accounts published in dubious UFO magazines. A second reproach that can be made is that the professor is perhaps a too over-zealous defender of the ETH. This is known to have affected his evaluations in the past. In 1988 for instance, an analysis of a sound recording made by a ten- year-old UFO witness in France led Meessen to speculate about the propulsion systems that UFO pilots use. Unfor- tunately for him, it was later established that the recorded beeping sound had originated from an over-the-horizon radar transmitter, an interference phenomenon well-known to French radio amateurs. One wonders if Meessen's personal convictions may not have influenced his analysis of the Belgium radar tapes as well. As a matter of fact, the unexplained radar images acted so spooky (impossible accelerations and sudden changes in altitude) that they remind one of false radar returns (due to meteorological conditions) or of distorted echoes from real targets (e.g., aircraft equipped with Stealth technology). But for Meessen the \"only reasonable hypothesis\" was that we were dealing with \"UFOs, of which the performances clear- ly indicate a non-terrestrial origin.\" A s for Dr. Petit, it was he who introduced magneto- hydrodynamics into ufology in the Seventies. Now, with the publication of his latest book, Enquete sur des extraterrestres qui sontparmi nous - Le mystere des Um- mites (In Search of Extraterrestrials Who Are Among Us - The Mystery of the Ummites), Petit has lost his last grain of credibility. In this book Petit reveals that his scientific work at the CNRS was in reality dictated to him by the inhabitants of Umrno, a planet far beyond our own solar system. Well- read ufologists will remember that, dating back to 1965, the Ummites have been held responsible for a series of mysterious letters and documents sent to UFO researchers and scientists around the world. In fact, the Ummo virus seems to have affected other scien- tists at the Space Center as well and rumours have it that the entire question will soon lead to some sort of purification. Another incident is bound to discredit the Center's reputa- tion even further. Last year, two journalists of a local French newspaper visited the headquarters of the Raelian Movement in Albi, southern France. This UFO sect is led by a man who claims to have travelled to distant planets and to have sat at a table with personalities such as Moses, Jesus and Buddha. During their visit to the sect, the journalists ran into a research member from the CNRS. Together with a doctor, a biologist and an engineer, the man had just ordered pizza and ice cream on the cult's premises! Returning to the Belgian flap, it should first be emphasized that the evidence gathered by SOBEPS is impressive in quan- tity but not very convincing when considered as proof of unearthly manifestations. In fact, the photographic evidence THE UMMO VIRUS SEEMS TO HAVE AFFECTED OTHER SCIENTISTS AT THE SPACE CENTER AS WELL. A DEVELOPMENT THAT MAY SOON RESULT IN A PURIFICATION PROCESS. yielded only one good slide, a copy of which is printed on the cover of the SOBEPS book. On page 418 we are told that an indepth investigation of this slide has yet to take place; but the absence of background details in the picture, together with the fact that the young photographer threw away a sec- ond photograph which he had taken during the sighting, create doubts about the authenticity of the evidence. Stimuli for most of the remaining photographic documents varied from aircraft lights to reflections of sunlight in distant windows, and from bright stars and planets to xenon-lamps used by some discos. Many of these explanations came from the ufologists themselves, SOBEPS members included. As for the eyewitness accounts that are not backed up with physical evidence, they number several thousand and main- ly describe incidents which occurred within an area 200 kms long and 100 kms wide. About 5 to 10% of these cases are published in some detail in the book. Examination reveals that there is much less internal agreement in the descriptions than SOBEPS would like us to believe. Position and colour of the lights are rarely identical. Features, such as protru- sions, windows, domes and hatches always appear to be posi- tioned at different sides of the objects. Furthermore, not only triangle, but rectangle, trapezoid, diamond and boomerang-shaped objects were also reported. In short, exactly those shapes that match designers' views of what airplanes of the future should look like. Apparently, the old flying saucer myth has put on a new face, perfectly in line with modern trends in design. Also worthy of note is the fact that only one or two witnesses mentioned daylight objects. It is the opinion of the author that some kind of flying machine did indeed manifest itself over our country on several occasions between November 1989 and June 1991. This may have been some kind of platform, balloon or giant glider (self propelled or carried by helicopter), or perhaps an experimental airplane such as the F-117A Stealth Fighter, the A-12 Avenger or the TR-3A Black Manta. To try to find out the exact origin and motive of these apparitions will be extremely difficult because of the extensive media coverage that seems to have immensely influenced the reporting process. The only thing that remains certain, even in the midst of a flap of major proportions, is the feet that it has proven almost impossible to solidify eyewitness accounts with substantial evidence.

Barry Downing's commentary on the UFO experience (\"The Rock of Ages Principle,\" MUFON UFO Journal, May 1990) is important because it further directs the attention of the ufological research com- munity to the religious implications of UFOs. His 1968 book, The Bible and Flying Saucers, is a seminal work in the field. There he argues that some biblical passages are best under- stood in light of UFO research, including accounts of angels or God's messengers. However, while Downing's perspective is a highly plausi- ble explanation for some ancient events, I do not find it ac- ceptable as an explanation of contemporary abductions. I am especially concerned that he tries to convince us that \"disguise and deception\" should be regarded as benevolent. He says we may have to decide whether UFOs are good or evil, and he opts for the \"good\" position, arguing that UFO reports, including abductions, are best understood in light of the biblical doctrine of angels. I find Downing's position flawed because the Bible recognizes \"fallen\" angels who retained their superhuman capacities but turned from their allegiance to God. Since then, their paranormal abilities have been used for evil rather than good. Thus, the choice Downing would have us make with regard to UFO entities is not a simple either-or. Both good and evil are possibilities, depending on the sort of angels with which one is dealing. Downing is well aware of the \"fallen angel\" perspective on UFOs; his contribution to the 1980 Encyclopedia of UFOs entitled \"Demonic Theory of UFOs\" is an excellent survey of the topic. Despite that, in \"The Rock of Ages Principle\" he arrives at what I regard as an unsupportable conclusion. My response to it focuses on the phenomenon of alien ab- ductions and examines them in the light of biblical doctrine. I disagree with Downing's interpretation for several reasons other than the one above. First, there is nothing in the Bible which indicates that God or God's messengers use deceit as standard operating procedure. Due care for human limitations, yes - deceit, no. Only the primal adversary of God - called Lucifer/Satan - does that and is therefore known as the Great Deceiver. Second, nothing in the Bible indicates that contact with God's messengers results in the wild stories and wounded psyches of contemporary abductees. God's messengers iden- tify themselves as such and state their purpose. They pre- sent their credentials without equivocation. Last of all, God's messengers show respect for the sanctity of human life and do not overpower human will. Yes, one can point to the Angel of Death, acting at God's command, to slay the firstborn of of the Egyptians when the Hebrews were in captivity, but that is the exception, not the rule. Any deaths which have occurred in connection with alien abductions - and I'll discuss some below - simply cannot be compared to that biblical cir- cumstance. Abductees are not contemporary Pharaohs and the god of the Bible is a god of love and life-enhancement. My interpretation contrasts radically with what Downing calls his \"God hypothesis,\" while retaining a framework of religious concerns. And although it may seem that I am merely offering the simplistic Christian fundamentalism which Down- ing rightly rejects, I maintain there is an enlightened fundamentalism - that is, grasp of true fundamentals - which is congruent with that position but has greater depth and solidi- ty because it is grounded in ufological data, metaphysical understanding and spiritual insight. That is what I offer here. It is a \"worst case scenario.\" Before proceeding further, however, I want to acknowledge that my interpretation is also similar to some scare-mongering science fiction novels and movies. And I acknowledge that it has underpinning assumptions which are open to challenge. (To name just two: Are the alien abductions physically real events or psychological projections from the mythic-imaginal level of the human unconscious? Are the MJ-12 documents authentic?) Moreover, the data on which I build this scenario are few, tenuous and far from indisputable. The evidence for my position is difficult to describe to an audience which is not psychologically sophisticated and parapsychologically educated. I've circulated a draft of this paper to a handful of UFO investigators and theorists. Some agree with me, in whole or in part; others think that, as one put it, I am \"com- pletely off-base\" and \"lapsing into a kind of primitive super- naturalism and infantile paranoia.\" Perhaps so. I acknowledge the possibility, but at this point I'm not convinced to see things differently. Therefore I pre- sent this statement as an hypothesis for discussion of what is a perplexing aspect of the UFO experience - and poten- tially the most important. I welcome critical feedback in the interest of reality-testing. I don't claim to have the \"final\" answer to the UFO question. (I've said before that I think John White is a well-known author, editor and literary agent, and host of the annual UFO Experience conference in New Haven, CT, near his home. His work covers a wide range of topics. He is the author, for example, of What Is Enlightenment? and the editor of Psychic War- fare: Fact or Fiction?, among many others. The opinions expressed here are of course his own and do not in any way reflect those of MUFON or the editors of this Journal. MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 286 February 1992"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"there is no single answer to that question.) And I am not \"locked in\" to this hypothesis. I only claim that this state- ment is the result of thoughtful observation and analysis by a seasoned investigator of the paranormal which draws out reasonable implications and leads logically to a plausible con- clusion. I recognize, however, that a chain is no stronger than its weakest links and that this chain of logic has various weak links. So I simply offer the following with sincerity, the most rigorous thinking I can bring to it, and a wish to provoke fur- ther discussion and investigation along the lines I'm develop- ing. Of course, it's possible to be sincere but deluded. I am willing — indeed, eager — to be shown that is so in this case because if I'm right, even partially, we're all in big trouble. T he thrust of UFO research is into the metaphysical, where things are not always as they seem. Downing sees UFOs — meaning, in these circumstances, the gray abducting aliens — as benevolent, superior beings who com- passionately take into account, through \"disguise and decep- tion,\" our inability to directly perceive their \"vastly superior reality.\" In Downing's interpretation, that reality is traditionally known as the full glory of God. In my judgment, however, the gray abducting aliens are demonic and untrustworthy. \"By their fruits ye shall know them,\" Jesus said about evaluating spiritual credentials. Saint Paul added that the fruits of the Spirit are peace, joy and love. Judging by the fruit of the gray abducting aliens, I see aspects to the UFO abduction ex- perience which indicate there may be profoundly sinister dimensions to it. I get a strong sense of conspiracy by the abductors — a vast, subversive plot of long duration and careful coordination which aims at nothing less than the complete enslavement of humanity. I see nothing about their words and deeds which indicates anything except lies, evasion, misdirec- tion, manipulation, exploitation and total disregard for human values, personal property and our concept of respect for the inviolability of personhood. We humans consider kidnapping and violation of civil rights to be criminal, rape to be loathsome, brainwashing and mind control to be heinous, lying to be despicable, deliberate in- fliction of pain to be sadism, unauthorized surgical invasion and unauthorized impregnation of people to be monstrous, mutilation of bodies to be savage, and damage to personal property to be vandalism. The gray abducting aliens exhibit such behavior — and possibly even murder (see footnote 4). On the other hand, I know of no behavior by them which is clearly intended to show respect for our physical or psychological personhood, property, civil rights, moral values and concern for truthful speech; the abducting aliens routinely violate all that. As I view the situation, it's a ghastly picture which emerges. It is not merely alien; it is profoundly evil in precisely the sense given in the Book of Revelation and other sacred scriptures which describe a battle between the forces of light and the forces of darkness for the salvation or damnation of humanity and the planet. So when abduct- ing aliens allegedly say, \"We're here to serve you,\" I take it to mean they have something like cookbook recipes in mind. SO WHEN ABDUCTING AUENS ALLEGEDLY SAY \"WE'RE HERE TO SERVE YOU,\" I TAKE IT TO MEAN THEY HAVE SOMETHING LIKE COOKBOOK RECIPES IN MIND I want to make clear that I am limiting this discussion to one class of UFO entities: gray abducting aliens. I am not condemning all gray aliens. I'm willing to believe there may be good ones, just as there are good and bad people. And speaking more generally, my assessment of ufology's data leads me to conclude that Earth is probably one of the major crossroads of local space, with many alien life forms visiting us. Some of them may indeed be motivated by vision and values in keeping with our own most transcendent insights and sacred wisdom. Others, however, are not — and that is my point. If alien abductions are the work of angels, let us be clear about who they are: fallen angels or demonic entities. To get specific about what I think may be going on, con- sider the humans and / or humanoids who have been reported by abductees to be present on UFOs, apparently working with and for the aliens. There are many such reports, most notably that by Travis Walton. If the grays have been conducting a genetic experiment or an interspecies breeding program for at least several decades — which is what Budd Hopkins' work indicates — then there could be adult humans who have been raised under alien control since infancy and who are thoroughly alien in their loyalties and psychology, although they certainly would be able to pass as \"real\" people. While seeming to be ordinary citizens, they would nevertheless be at least programmed, if not naturally inclined through psychological bonding, to identify with the alien culture. Such people could have been raised in an off-world site —say,'a base on the moon or Mars or even a gigantic \"mother ship\" 1 — and then reintroduced to human society, with suf- ficient training and ongoing support from aliens to make their way into careers in many fields. D epending on the scope of the aliens' work — which I take to be happening on an enormous scale since abduction reports are .worldwide —the abducting aliens could have hundreds or even thousands of their peo- ple infiltrated into science, industry, finance, government, education, the military, etc., with some undoubtedly in posi- tions of great power and influence. These people, in turn, could have recruited others to various degrees, creating in classic fashion the \"cells\" of a resistance movement prepar- ing to overthrow the establishment. More likely, though, they would have made their true identity known only to other \"aliens among us\" and committed true-human collaborators who have been voluntarily working with the aliens. How might the aliens begin to infiltrate and recruit? The MJ-12 group offers a point of entry. A crashed flying saucer would be \"bait\" to hook the military-government-scientific complex into contact. Of course, this infiltration activity would not be limited to the United States. If the aliens are doing it here, they're probably doing it elsewhere. If they've made contact with MJ-12 or its successors — as the Project Aquarius, MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 286 February 1992"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"REMEMBER THAT AMERICAN POWs IN KOREA AND VIETNAM WERE CONTINUALLY SUBJECTED TO BRAIN-WASHING BECAUSE, WHILE THEIR BODIES HAD BEEN CAPTURED. THEIR MINDS HADNT. Project Snowbird, Project Sigma and Project Gamma reports indicate 2 — we can be fairly certain they've contacted the Soviet Union and other major powers. (Timothy Good's Above Top Secret demonstrates a worldwide cover-up of the UFO phenomenon, although he doesn't take that to the extreme I do here.) However, being scheming, untrustworthy and bent on planetary domination, the aliens would not have told MJ-12 anything about their contact with other scientific and govern- mental / military officials or groups they have contacted over the decades. It wouldn't do to let each know about the others. Infiltration would be the hidden agenda behind their contact with MJ-12 and the governmental-military-scientific elite of the world until the time is right to let all players know of the others' participation. In the meantime, since \"loose lips sink ships,\" the military- intelligence community would have undertaken counter- intelligence, disinformation and media influence programs to discredit anyone on the inside who might come forward to tell the truth and anyone on the outside who might sur- mise the truth. Thus, the ridicule and harassment which people who tell stories about ETs or UFOs encounter may have been started or aggravated by MJ-12 or its successors. Once the attitude \"caught on\" with the public, anyone who broached the subject was considered a lunatic and his / her claims or data disregarded. How could there be a \"Hanger 18\" at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base or Alternative 3 - like col- onies on the moon and Mars when everyone knows that UFOs are sheer fantasy, hallucination or misperception? In parallel with the aliens' infiltration movement would be Manchurian Candidate-like programming of the true-human abductees and collaborators, as well as alien-human hybrids produced through interspecies breeding. My thinking is this: If the grays' ultimate intention is world control, they have several ways to get there. Their last resort would be violent takeover, using open warfare. That would certainly unite true humans in opposition, and even if the grays conquered humanity, we would continue to resist them by any and all means, even if our condition were reduced to the status of POWs at a Hanoi Hilton. No, the aliens would seek a bloodless takeover by conquering through deception, manipulation and propaganda. Remember that American POWs in Korea and Vietnam were continually subjected to brainwashing because their bodies were captured but not their minds. The aliens 'Would recognize that and, in order to make their victory com- plete, try to indoctrinate us, through covert means, to accept them as we walk down a garden path, rather than have to \"re- educate\" some five billion people in effect held captive as POWs. So, the more intelligent approach to total control would be to co-opt the human race — to subvert it through a cultural conditioning control system such as Jacques Vallee suggests in Messengers of Deception and Dimensions. (To be flip about it, we can call it the \"crock of ages principle\" — meaning crock of you-know-what.) MJ-12 and its counterparts in other nations would be the starting point. Here's where the plot thickens. In fact, it ties in with more mundane conspiracy theories in the political sphere which allege that groups such as the Rothschilds, Rockefellers, Trilateralists, Bilderbergers, Council on Foreign Relations and others are the hidden powers and the secret establishments directing world affairs through international banking and con- trol of the media, education, science and military / political institutions in order to set up a one-world social order with themselves at the seats of power. There are some plausible arguments for the political con- spiracy theory made by responsible, credible thinkers and scholars such as Carroll Quigley and Antony Sutton; there are also some absolutely bozo claims made by head-for-the- hills redneck survivalists and fringe Christian fundamentalists. I try to assess them all to see what looks viable, weighing them against my standards of reason, logic and evidence. Now, it's perfectly clear, thanks to the Iran-Contra affair, that in- ternational conspiracies can and do happen. The real ques- tion is to what degree and how well coordinated and con- trolled they are by the alleged secret powers. Until the last few years, I pretty much dismissed the no- tion of a generations-old international conspiracy to set up a one-world society controlled by international banking- financial interests such as the Rockefellers and Rothschilds. I reasoned that if there were one conspiracy, there would be others, and the net result would be to negate or at least neutralize each other. No one would gain total control or unassailable ascendancy. The vagaries of world affairs would be too unpredictable; too many things could go wrong; peo- ple wouldn't stay loyal to such a cause all their lives; evidence of it simply couldn't be covered up forever. Then the abducting gray aliens came into view, and the situation took on a wholly different complexion. If the aliens have secretly planted their agents throughout civilization for decades and if they are pursuing contact with the top echelons of power around the world for purposes of infiltration and subversion, then over the years they have been playing out a hand which was strategized nowhere but in Hell. L ook at MJ-12's roster. The members and their probable successors lead straight into the heart of the most disturbing \"conventional\" conspiracy theories about international finance and military / political / scientific in- trigue. For example, consider the Skull and Bones Society at Yale University. It is, from the political conspiracy theorists' point of view, the quintessential \"evil empire\" within the USA. George Bush, McGeorge Bundy, and a large number of the Trilateral Commission members and the Council on Foreign Relations were tapped by this secret society while they were undergraduates at Yale and were bound by an oath of secrecy to be loyal to the \"Bones\" purpose. That purpose goes far beyond simple collegia! fraternity and the typical \"good oF boy\" network's interests. MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 286 February 1992"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"The conspiracy theorists say that the aim of all this is to covertly create a new world order in which the secret establish- ment becomes the hidden power controlling global affairs — its economy, science, industry, religion, education, technology, etc., even while maintaining a facade of increasing freedom and prosperity for the world's masses. Nationhood would wither away, but political power would not. It would be con- solidated behind a screen through the fraternal bonds of men (Skull and Bones presently excludes women) whose aims and loyalty are not to any country or group, but only to their own supranational cabal. They would be \"the power behind the throne.\" Imagine that such a conspiracy has been going on for decades. That would explain U.S. State Department approval of high-technology transfer from American industry to the Soviet Union, even when it ends up being used against America in military situations — as has happened. It would also explain multimillion dollar bank loans to the Soviet Union with no assurances sought that they wouldn't be used to under- write anti-American activities — as has happened. Then im- agine that the aliens not only know of the conspiracy and understand its operations, but have also cunningly planned to co-opt it by pretending to establish friendly relations with it. What would be the nature of the directing intelligence behind the aliens' scheme? It seems to me that the gray aliens alone are not smart enough or powerful enough to pull it off, despite their technological edge. They appear to be rather robotic or hive-like in their capacities. They appear to lack the intellectual creative flair for such scheming. A greater intelligence is required. I see it like this: The alien abductors are glad to let the secret establishment continue its work aimed at world domination because the humans involved don't realize the danger they've gotten into by making what is in reality a diabolical pact — in the most literal sense. The secret establishment thinks it's simply got an edge by making contact with the aliens because the aliens can provide advanced technology 3 to help the power brokers advance their scheme; all they have to do is let the aliens con- tinue with their \"scientific\" work of abducting people for \"ex- amination.\" But the aliens' intention is to be the power behind the power behind the throne. And the MJ-12 successors played right into their hands. U FO conspiracy theorist John Lear says that a team amalgamated from MJ-12 and the CIA have had a longtime joint venture in which hidden underground bases for alien activity play a part. He also says the team is now scared of that alliance because they have begun to realize the magnitude of the deadly game into which they've been suckered. From the perspective of this hypothesis, that makes sense. Just as they and their fellow conspirators see their \"final\" victory nearing — i.e., global affairs are tending well for the establishment of a one-world order, exactly as the con- spirators have been working for over decades — the aliens trump them and in effect the secret establishment itself becomes secretly, subtly but inescapably enslaved, exactly THE ALIEN \"MEDICAL EXAM\" IS A SHAM AND A COVER FOR SOMETHING ELSE. as they sought to do to others. A delicious irony is there — but don't laugh too loud about it because, if this hypothesis is correct, the situation is appalling. It's the Book of Revela- tion coming true: a titanic war is being waged in \"the heavens\" — i.e., invisibly — between the powers of light and the powers of darkness for the liberation or enslavement of all humanity. I'll say more about the powers of light in a moment. For now, return to those alien-raised humans and humanoids. If the aliens are as knowledgeable about human psychology, physiology and anatomy as UFO research indicates, then they are wholly competent to \"program\" human beings and humanoids to react in certain ways upon signal. Under hyp- nosis, abductee Betty Andreasson stated repeatedly in The Andreasson Affair — Phase Two that she would reveal something in the future when the time is right as determined by the aliens; quite independently, her future husband, Bob Luca, received exactly the same mental programming from abducting grays. All the hypnotists' skill could not retrieve the unrevealed information from Andreasson because there was/is a second, deeper-level block in her mind to prevent people from learning the truth about the aliens' intention, even after the primary block was removed and her abduction reveal- ed. The hypnotist, Fred Max, agrees with me on this point. After speaking with him, I was gratified to see that Raymond Fowler's The Watchers confirms and greatly elaborates on this point. Fowler initially titled the book The Andreasson Affair —Phase Three because it reveals much more about the Lucas' experience and their precise, profound programming by the aliens (\"... they have been and are in control of all the information stored within the deep recesses of Betty's mind\" p. 128), as well as Fowler's own. On the basis of these further revelations, Fowler states, \"They know more about our overall makeup than we do ourselves\" (p. 183). Think about the so-called medical exam given to abductees. Isn't is perfectly obvious now that the abduction-as-medical- exam scenario is merely a cover for something else? How many skin samples do alien \"scientists\" need before they have sufficient data? Why, as David Jacobs points out in a forthcom- ing book, hasn't their data-gathering become more sophis- ticated over the decades? It hasn't changed since Betty and Barney Hill were abducted in 1961. Why the now-stereotyped, unvarying and well-rehearsed routine for thousands of ab- ductees? While performing — in the sense of theatrical acting —their seemingly elementary examination of ab- ductees, the aliens demonstrate that they actually have a deep and highly detailed knowledge of human psychology, physiology and anatomy. Abductee reports show that the aliens can completely control the human nervous system. When aliens want to abduct them, abductees are routinely paralyzed instantly and placed in suspended animation. When they are on alien examination tables and report feeling pain from some operation, the mere touch of an alien hand can block the MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 286 February 1992"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"person's perception of pain. Reports also show that aliens can effect instant healings, alter memory, distort a person's sense of time, and perform precise surgical operations on the brain and visceral organs, not to mention the wide range of gynecological procedures they employ. I conclude that the alien \"medical exam\" is a sham and a cover for something else, namely, brainwashing and mind control. For what purpose? I suspect this: the alien-humans would undoubtedly be programmed to rise up violently in armed warfare if the aliens felt it necessary to achieve their aims in ex- tremis. Imagine hundreds of thousands of Manchurian Can- didates, each programmed to assassinate or otherwise eliminate designated leaders and officials so that the aliens' hand-trained agents can come forward. Is that far out? Not in the shadowy — or should I say gray? — world of political intrigue, subversion and life-or-death struggle for conquest of Planet Earth. 4 W here would all the alien-humans come from? Many would have been bred in vitro from sperm and ova, or raised from fetuses, as Budd Hopkins' research indicates. But many others could have been obtained the easy way — by kidnapping children. An estimated one million children are missing in the United States each year. Where could they all go? If just one percent of them were abducted by aliens, that's a sizable population to work with at off-world bases. If you grant the plausibility of this admittedly fantastic scenario so far, it then makes sense to say that the grays are not the \"ultimate\" type of beings contacting us in this mat- ter. The grays are alien, and perhaps they're extraterrestrial. (I present the case for grays as extraterrestrials in \"ET or MT? A Response to Kenneth Ring,\" Mufon UFO Journal, July 1989. That statement was deliberately devoid of the con- siderations made here.) They may also be what J. Allen Hynek called metaterrestrial. Whatever the case, it appears there is another \"race\" behind the abducting gray aliens, directing their activities. This \"race\" is not merely \"alien\" — it is evil. It is truly sinister, malevolent and unswervingly committed to the damnation of all humanity — and it is definitely not extraterrestrial. These intelligences have been characterized in ancient scrip- tures and sacred traditions as native to Earth, diabolic, hostile to our very existence as free people and intent upon dominating us totally — physically, mentally and spiritually. St. Paul spoke of humanity contending with \"powers and prin- cipalities.\" My reason, research and personal experience lead me to conclude that such entities are onto logically real, albeit paraphysical. I see the hand of such intelligences behind much of the UFO phenomenon. I will even name the chief entity, using its Judeo-Christian appellation: Lucifer/Satan. To say more than that in a meaningful manner, however, would take far more space than I have here. I am prepared to get into the issue of Lucifer/Satan and its nature, purpose and role in the UFO experience, but that will depend on my assess- ment of the response to this article. Taking the widest possible view of the situation, I will say that, in my judgment, we humans are not alone against forces of darkness. I also see benign and even benevolent \"alien in- telligences\" here as well — forces of light — trying to assist us in this struggle for psychobiological integrity, spiritual ad- vancement and true planetary unity — not a new world order but a new world community. We are \"surrounded by angels, unaware.\" These agents of godliness seek in gentle, non- coercive ways to guide us, protect us and enlighten us. For example, the beings of light whom people meet dur- ing a near-death experience (NDE) are providing tremendous support for humanity. The light-beings' nature is clearly evi- dent by the effect they have upon human lives. Completely unlike the abducting grays, the NDE light-beings produce no traumatic or ambiguous consequences on humanity. People who meet them while in the near-death state report later that they sensed only unconditional love and forgiveness for their misdeeds radiating wordlessly from these spiritual entities, along with heightened understanding of life. Abducting aliens induce fear and longlasting anxiety, disturbing dreams, in- tellectual confusion and a disturbed personality in their vic- tims; NDE light-beings have an aftereffect which brings people a sense of ultimate peace, cosmic goodness, reverence for life, deepened spirituality, concern for fellow humans and the environment — a general revaluing of materialistic, egotistic lifestyle in the name of God and Love. 5 Here in America alone, according to a Gallup poll, an estimated 14,000,000 people have undergone an NDE. If America is at the leading edge of a millennial demonic invasion directed by the \"Prince of Darkness,\" as I'm postulating, it is also the site of an even greater number of transformative, uplifting, inspiring en- counters with entities traditionally called angels, saints and enlightened teachers. And, like UFO abductions, such ac- tivity is happening around the globe. Altogether, this indicates a colossal support system of metaphysical forces which in- tend salvation — spiritual freedom — for humanity, building in opposition to what I have posited as a hellish plot aimed at complete enslavement of humanity and Planet Earth. In conclusion, I must acknowledge that some abductees disagree strongly with my hypothesis. They regard their ab- ductors' behavior as benevolent and intended for human bet- terment. (In The Watchers, Fowler explicitly equates the ab- ducting aliens with the NDE light-beings.) I do not deny that abductees, on the far side of their traumatic experience, often demonstrate psychological gains, and occasionally even ex- traordinary physiological health gains, as in the case of John Salter of North Dakota. All that does not negate my posi- tion. I attribute such transformation — such real benefits — to the innate human urge to health and the bodymind's self- reparative capability rather than to the aliens' noble inten- tions. Holocaust survivors are stronger for what they've been through, but they don't thank Hitler for it. Likewise, recover- ing alcoholics don't thank the bottle. And while I'm men- tioning the Nazis, I remind readers that the last attempt to \"improve\" the human race through a genetic breeding pro- gram such as the aliens apparently have was engineered by MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 286 February 1992"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"THE ABDUCTING ALIENS COME TO US UNDER THE COVER OF DARKNESS, BUT THEY NEVER TELL US WHY. THE WHOLE THING IS AS SUSPICIOUS AS A TROJAN HORSE. Adolph Hitler and the Third Reich. To put it simply: I am concerned here with spiritual discern- ment and denouncement of evil, concerned with truth, freedom and public safety. Downing's stance — that all ETs are from God — is representative of a widely held view whose variations range from \"ancient astronauts\" through \"Space Brothers\" to \"saviors from space.\" 6 I see that as one which unwittingly \"glorifies the devil\" by giving legitimacy to alien abductions. Legitimacy goes beyond merely establishing their reality; it passes into the moral dimension and makes or im- plies a public judgment of the aliens' benevolence and trustworthiness. This gives aid and comfort to \"the enemy,\" who, the Bible tells us, disguises itself as an \"angel of light.\" Yes, we called those flights of angels \"hordes of demons\" because they really are that — fallen angels. And lest I be accused of thinking in simplistic black-and- white, good-or-evil, us-vs.-them terms of Christian fundamen- talism, I hasten to say that is not so, as readers of my book The Meeting of Science and Spirit (Paragon House, 1990), will see. What is so is this: in keeping with Jesus' teaching about the proper attitude toward others, I regard the gray ab- ducting aliens and all other life forms with unconditional love. However, unconditional love is different from respect. My respect is entirely conditional; it must be earned. Uncondi- tional love is directed at personhood; respect is directed at behavior. The abducting aliens have not earned my respect. I judge their behavior — not their personhood — to be un- worthy of it. I am not casting them out of my heart; I am using my critical faculties to discriminate behavior from be- ingness and to condemn the sin, not the sinner. The abducting aliens always come to us under cover of darkness. They never tell us precisely why they abduct us. The whole thing is as suspicious to me as a Trojan Horse, so I'm simply voicing my concerns. If the aliens change their ways — if they reveal themselves in the light of day, une- quivocally state their business and allow us to convince ourselves of their benevolence — I'll welcome them into human society. But until they present themselves to us in unambiguous circumstances and without veiled intent, until they present themselves as trustworthy visitors to Earth-who do not violate and harm its human inhabitants, I shall con- tinue to regard them as cunning, predatory creatures from a nether world bent on evil-disguised-as-good. And whether they ultimately prove to be physical, paraphysical or metaphysical will have no bearing on that conclusion. Notes 1) In 1972, while visiting the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, I learned from my tour guide - a JPL employee - that the facility had analyzed many UFO photographs. The guide told me that JPL had explained away all of them except one. That one, he said, was taken by a man who provided such good information about the time of day, loca- tion, camera and film that JPL, after using computer enhancement of the photo, could offer only two explanations. The man who submitted the photo said he saw a UFO passing in front of the moon. The guide said JPL would not confirm it but was convinced there definitely was something real in the photo. The only trouble was that they couldn't tell if it was a small object about two feet in front of the camera or something 1,000 miles long at a distance of 100,000 miles from Earth. A mother ship? 2) These projects were reported by Jerome Clark in fate magazine (April 1988) in the last of his four-part article on crashed UFO retrievals. 3) Another implication of this scenario is that MJ-12 or its successors had access to UFOs through their alien contacts. If so, it must be assumed that (1) MJ-12 or its successors took advantage of that to visit the moon and other planets in our solar system long before the Apollo 11 moon land- ing in 1969, and (2) the NASA space exploration program is a gigantic boondoggle whose real purpose is to be another secret conduit for fund- ing military/intelligence projects which are intended to be kept from scrutiny by Congress and the public. 4) I do not mean to have people regard all abductees with suspicion and fear, which might lead to a modern witch hunt against them. My sym- pathy for them is genuine and strong, and I trust that this essay makes that clear. I say this because Betty Andreasson Luca and Bob Luca, who are friends of mine, do not agree with me concerning the possibility of Manchurian Candidate programming of themselves and others. They do not believe the grays are evil, including their abductors, and have asked me to refer people to two quotations from Raymond Fowler's books about them. Betty points to her statement from The Andreasson Affair as evidence: \"He [Quazgaa, leader of the alien abductors] says my race won't believe me until much time has passed - our time... They love the human race. They have come to help the human race\" (pp. 110-11, Bantam edition). Bob points to his statement in The Andreasson Affair—Phase Two: \"[Fred Max, hypnotist] Why do they need to meet other people?\" [Bob] \"Prepare us for something good. Going to be for mankind\" (p. 40, Prentice-Hall edi- tion). Since our conversation, The Watchers (Bantam, 1990) has been published, and it amplifies their position greatly. The Watchers also reveals that the 1977 automobile accident in which Betty Andreasson lost two sons was \"foreseen\" by the aliens, who told her of it three days before their death. However, they claimed they could not intercede or do anything about it. Moreover, they suppressed Betty's conscious knowledge of it until afterward. I cannot accept that situation as simple precognition by the aliens. Parapsychological studies of precogni- tion indicate that warnings can be given in order to alert people to im- pending danger and thereby avert tragedy; that, if anything, is the biological purpose of extrasensory perception: survival. Common sense leads to the same conclusion. So why should the aliens refuse to let Betty recollect their warning before it was too late? Moreover, since the aliens have legen- dary capability for tracking people and likewise have technology capable of controlling our own, they were not powerless to intercede; ufology abounds with stories of vehicles' electromagnetic systems being overrid- den. Last of all, since they are masters of mind control, capable even to the point of programming precisely timed and exact behavior in people, I reluctantly conclude that the aliens knew about Betty's sons' death in advance because they deliberately engineered the \"accident.\" That can be described quite simply as murder. The aliens also told Betty that her religious faith would bring her through the tragedy. That proved true, but it was not thanks to the aliens. It seems to me that the situation had the effect of conditioning Betty - and, through her, Fowler and his readers - to the notion that the aliens are allied with her spiritual outlook, thus making even death an acceptable action in support of the aliens' hidden agenda. I therefore regard the situation as profoundly deceitful. It cleverly and completely undermines Betty's spiritual sensibilities. 5) For details, see Kenneth Ring's Life at Death (Morrow, 1980) and Heading Toward Omega (Morrow, 1984), Charles Flynn's After the Beyond (Prentice Hall, 1986) and George Ritchie's Return from Tomorrow (Chosen, 1978). MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 286 February 1992"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"6) Another example is Fowler's interpretation of the Lucas' abduction experiences. He asks in The Watchers, \"Are highly advanced beings from outer space god's agents of creation on this and other planets?\" (p. 206). He concludes the answer is yes; \"Watcher,\" he tells us, is translated from- the Chaldean word for a class of angelic beings responsible for watching over the affairs of humanity (p. 214). Somewhat similarly, G. Cope Schellhom's Extraterrestrials in Biblical Prophecy (Honus House: Madison, Wisconsin, 1989), concludes, \"It would appear that the present mission of the large group of assorted extraterrestrials now operating near earth is a standby mission, or as the Gospel of Matthew put it, a gathering of eagles, 'Wherever the body is, there the eagles will be gathered together' (Mt 24:28). \"Schellhorn, like Strieber, Fowler and Downing, indiscrim- inately lumps together all ETs as divinely motivated. There is a double irony in Schellhom's use of this biblical quotation. First, the more accurate translation is \"a gathering of vultures,\" as the Revised Standard Version notes, since eagles are not carrion-eaters who look for corpses. Second, and even more important, the quotation comes in the context of Jesus' enumeration of signs to distinguish false messiahs from the true one. A gathering of vultures, Jesus clearly indicates, is a sign of false messiahship - i.e., deception. Despite this and several other flaws in Schellhom's work, his book is a very useful survey of biblical events which might be better understood as encounters with extraterrestrial societies.

Dr. Laibow, a leading child and adult psychiatrist, is founder of The Center for Treatment and Research of Experienced Anomalous Trauma (TREAT). The model city's organiza- tional plan specifies methods and applications to deal with the extreme Soviet problem of alcoholism, which is a crip- pling factor in Russia's productivity. Dr. Laibow also presented a paper at the 2nd All Union Scientific Conference on UFOs organized by the SOYUZ UFO Center in Moscow. The three-day conference was pre- sided over by Dr. Vladimir G. Azhazha, internationally recognized as one of Ufology's leading scientists. Dr. Azhazha's \"invitation only\" conference heard from Russia's scientific community on the physical, mathematical and theoretical aspects of Ufology. Dr. Laibow spoke about her ongoing psychiatric work with abductees. Laibow also criticized past unscientific approaches to Ufology's artifacts. Laibow generated audience excitement by stating \"all my information was, is and will continue to be publicly available to you.\" She told the standing-room-only crowd of well over 300 that she continues to exchange UFO- related materials with Russian researchers, and called for strict laboratory testing and freely published results. Yuri Lubkow, Ph.D., a leading Soviet researcher with ex- cellent relationships with the Soviet government and UFO researchers alike, has promised Dr. Laibow \"metal-like balls\" from the Voronezh landing. The Voronezh case, ridiculed by the U.S. press when TASS first reported it, is considered to be one of the strongest cases in Russia. Lubkow and Laibow have agreed to collect, under strict scientific guidelines, UFO landing soil samples from 10 sites in Russia in the spring of 1992. Laibow also received for analysis a rock from a UFO crash site at Dalnagorsk supplied by Sergei Kuzionov, Ph.D., of the Leningrad State Technical University, and a member of the Council of Association for Anomalous Phenomena Research. Dr. Laibow was also given two large hardened soil samples from a UFO landing site in Middle Asia, presented to her by Andrew Poiarkow, a UFO researcher connected with an ESP laboratory in Moscow. Dr. Laibow cautioned her Soviet audience to be wary of hypnotically-induced abduction reports conducted by non- clinically trained investigators. She advised researchers to keep in mind that biological evidence is available to confirm at Drs. Rima Laibow and Vladimir Azhaaha in Moscow. least one aspect of alleged abductions. She proposed a study of morning-after urine analysis of UFO abductees. The body produces a substance in the urine as a result of traumatic stress. Such collected data would be invaluable. She urged researchers to make repeat abductees aware that this would be one viable step in confirming the reality of a biological stress state having taken place. Questions from the audience centered on U.S. claims of alien/human births, the so-called \"Star Children.\" Laibow said she hopes that DNA testing will be made available for such children and adults. Later, Dr. Azhazha proposed an exchange of information between SOYUZ and TREAT on the subject of Direct Con- tact. Dr. Laibow agreed to formally co-sponsor an Interna- tional UFO Conference with SOYUZ. The three-day event will be held in St. Petersburg, Russia in September. Dr. Azhazha intends to invite a large number of Soviet specialists on Direct Contact. TREAT'S co-sponsorship will enable U.S. and European scientists the opportunity to attend and for TREAT to help shape the direction of the conference. Laibow's TREAT IV Conference — The Range of the Anomalous — will be held April 9-12, 1992 in Atlanta, Georgia, sponsored by the Department of Philosophy of Georgia State University. A Clinicians' Workshop scheduled for April 8th and llth will be devoted to Russian anomalies. Leading Russian ex- perts studying the vast number of Big Foot sightings, UFO landings and contacts, and extra-sensory research have ac- cepted invitations to present papers. The general public's in- terest in previous TREAT \"by invitation only\" conferences has lead Dr. Laibow to open the 1992 Conference to the public.

The object was first detected at a distance of 25 miles and when it closed to 20 miles it made a wide turn to the east, on a course directly away from the carrier. As excerpted from a message to the Commander, Naval Forces Far East, sent by the Philippine Sea, the report on the speed and unusual separation into two objects of this UFO contact stated: \"Measured speed 10 miles per-minute (600 MPH) for first minute, 15 miles per minute (900 MPH) for second minute, 30 miles per minute (1800 MPH) for third minute. Opened as two contacts five to 12 miles apart.\" Three signal observers on the deck of the ship sighted the UFO visually and reported independently to the bridge that they could detect three exhaust flames. However, no aircraft at that time was capable of the incredible speeds attained by the UFO and no conventional aircraft were reported in the area. The estimated altitude of the object was 52,000 feet; it faded from the radar scope at a distance of 110 miles. A letter classified Secret was sent by the Far East Com- mander to the Chief of Naval Operations, enclosing a track chart of the UFO in question and stating, in part: \"Enclosure (1) is forwarded for information and evaluation. This is pro- bably the first instance of a visual and radar contact on a high speed aerial target being made simultaneously in the Far East.\" The Pentagon issued a press release on the 20th announcing that an investigation of the UFO encounters in the Korean war zone was \"full scale,\" adding that top officials in Washington were being briefed on the case (The Hynek UFO Report, by Dr. J. Allen Hynek; UFOs: A History, 1952, by Loren Gross) • 1957 A challenging Radar-Visual case occurred at Lin- coln Air Force Base, Nebraska, on the 13th. UFOs were visually observed by three control operators and by the Direc- tor of Operations, who was in town to supervise a wing mis- sion. Objects were also observed on radar by two separate radar installations for three to five minutes. The UFOs were about five to six miles behind an airliner and moving twice as fast. One of the objects separated in two and another made a 180-degree turn. The radar operators estimated that the UFOs were about the size of a B-47 bomber. They appeared to stand still and then speed up and rush away. (The UFO Ex- perience: A Scientific Inquiry, by Dr. J. Allen Hynek) • An Unidentified Flying Object swept across the skies of Houston, Texas on the 27th. The object was reported to Ell- ington Air Force Base by F. J. Cornell of the Ground Observer Corps, who said he saw it make several sweeps across the sky between 8 and 9 p.m. Then seven men of a radar crew in an Air Defense detachment at Ellington saw the UFO and tried unsuccessfully to pick it up on the radar scope. Lt. J. R. Poole said it moved across the sky and disappeared in 45 seconds. It looked like a star. He estimated its height at 40,000 to 50,000 feet and its speed at 2000 MPH, judging by its size and the lack of sound. He said Cornell looked at the object through binoculars and reported it looked white and \"seemed to have some fire coming out of the back end.\" (The Caller, Corpus Christi, TX, 2/28/57) 1967 • At 3:40 a.m. on the second, Mrs. Ed Winn open- ed the front door of her home to check on weather condi- tions. \"I didn't believe what my eyes were looking at,\" she said. Just a few feet over the television antenna of a neighbor's house was an object \"as big, every bit as big, as my living room,\" Mrs. Winn said. She said it remained motionless, mak- ing not a sound. Mrs. Winn described the UFO as having a silver dome, encircled about two-thirds of the way down with a flange, which appeared to be a soft green fluorescent light. Around the dome she said she could see what appeared to be windows. After 20 minutes, with neither Mrs. Winn nor the \"thing\" making a move, the mysterious craft began to move slowly away. (The American, W. Frankfort, IL, 3/4/67) • Mrs. James Thompson had a strange experience about 10 p.m. on the 13th. She was driving in Bigfork, Montana when the engine in her pickup truck stalled and all of the lights went out. Mrs. Thompson got out of the vehicle and noticed a light above. \"It was so bright I couldn't even look at it.\" Her two small children, Karen, 4, and Alan, 5, were with her. Mrs. Thompson got back into the pickup, sat for awhile and told her children to look at the bright object. She wasn't able to gauge the distance, but when the object veered to the right the engine started strangely without her pressing the starter. Mrs. Thompson said she could feel heat from the greenish-blue lighted object which moved over toward the trees and changed color to reddish-orange. It seemed circular in shape. The object was in sight for about 10 minutes. (Hungry Horse News, Columbia Falls, MT, 2/24/67) 1972 • An unexpected encounter with a mystery light on the evening of the 26th on the outskirts of Lamed, Kansas, left Johnnie Beer, a high school junior, shaken and frighten- ed. Young Beer told his parents that a big, white light ap- peared in front of his car as he was leaving Larned around 9 p.m., headed for the farm home. \"Johnnie said the light lowered down in front of the car and kept about 100 yards ahead,\" Mrs. Beer reported. \"He said it frightened him and MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 286 February"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"he slowed down and speeded up, but the object kept right in front of him. When Johnnie turned north at Riverside School, the object circled and traveled in front of him,\" she said. \"As he turned west to the farm the light turned again and followed him into the farmyard where it hovered over the corral. \"Johnnie said he ran into the house and closed the doors and drapes but when we arrived home about a half hour later, we didn't see anything,\" Mrs. Beer added. \"But the next mor- ning, the bottom two wires of the corral fence looked like they had been cut and twisted up in a pile in the corral, and several of our milk cows had burn spots on their backs.\" The hair in the burn spots was singed to the skin. (Tiller & Toiler, Lamed, KS, 2/28/72) 1977 • When Madison County Sheriffs Deputy Kenneth Creel left on routine patrol on the evening of the second, he didn't expect to find his attention completely focused on a UFO. Deputy Creel first saw the object west of Flora, Mississippi, near the county line. He was with Constable James Luke at the time. \"It looked like an evening star or something,\" said Creel, but it kept getting brighter and bigger.\" Creel contacted the Mississippi Highway Patrol with his car radio. When the strange object came within some 200 yards of his car, Creel said he \"stopped and cut my engine and my lights to listen.\" What he heard was a whir- ring sound \"like a blender, like it was straining, when you first put ice in it.\" \"The thing came right over the car,\" said Creel, \"like it was being piloted. It hovered over us, about 20 or 30 feet up, for more than a minute.\" There was light coming out from little windows. The craft was about 30 to 40 feet in diameter and perfectly round. By this time Highway patrolman Louis Younger had driven his patrol car within a short distance of the UFO and reported seeing the same craft. Then the thing just picked up and took off. (The Madison County Herald, Canton, MS, 2/17/77) • About 4 a.m. on the 18th, Angel Maria Tonna, a 52-year- old rancher who lived on a farm nine miles south of Sal to, Uruguay, and his foreman, Juan Manuel Fernandez, were driv- ing about 80 cows into the barn for milking when all of the barnyard lights went out. Then a bright light appeared on the east end of the barn. Tonna jumped over the fence and ran toward the source of the light at the far end of the barn. His dog Topo was with him. \"Then I heard a noise,\" he said, and he saw a fiery disc like two plates placed face-to-face hovering a short distance above the ground behind the barn. He stood and watched until he noticed that the cows \"were going crazy\" and all the dogs were barking. At this point the disc began to move in a southerly direc- tion, breaking off the branches of a tree near the barn. The object displayed a rocking motion as it flew, and stopped and hovered over some trees about 100 yards south of the barn at an altitude of about 60 feet. It stayed there only a moment, then moved east another 75 yards or so, and stopped above a concrete bath that the cows were forced to walk through to disinfect them. By then Tonna and his dog, a 60-pound black and brown police dog, had run back to the west side of the barnyard and climbed back over the fence. The light from the craft illuminated the whole barnyard and Tonna said he felt attracted to it. Tonna and Topo walked a , few feet toward the UFO and it made another turn and began moving toward them. It came to a stop about 60 feet from them and Topo ran toward it to attack it and protect Tonna, but stopped and sat on a small mound about 15 feet from the object and looked up at it and howled. When the object started moving toward Tonna, he noticed six beams of light, three on each side \"like small wings.\" At that point, Tonna said, he felt electric shocks which went all through his body and a very intense heat hit him. He flung an arm up over his face to shield his eyes. He said he felt attracted to the light and couldn't move. \"I don't know if I couldn't move or didn't want to,\" he said. After several minutes the object began moving away, turn- ing from its original bright orange color to red. It increased its speed as the color changed and when it got to the forest about a half mile to the south, it was out of sight. When the disc left, the generator, which powers 20 lights in the barn- yard area, started running again but didn't produce any elec- tricity because the wires were burned out. The whole inci- dent lasted about 10 minutes and Tonna's 19-year-old son, Tulio, who was a second year veterinary student at the Univer- sity in Salto, witnessed the whole episode from the house. Following the UFO encounter the dog would not eat or drink. He moved around normally but stayed in the house all day, which was unusual. On the morning of the third day after the incident,' Topo was found dead on the same mound where he had sat and howled at the disc. An autopsy was per- formed at the ranch by a veterinarian who teaches at the North University in Salto. The doctor would not discuss the case but he did let Tulio make a copy of the autopsy report which said, in part: \"The hair along the animal's spine was sticky but completely hard. The fat under the skin was found on the outside. The fat is normally solid, so to get to the outside it had to be melted and come through the pores. Once it was outside it solidified again. The animal was exposed to a very high temperature that can't be reached naturally by the dog. All the blood vessels had been bleeding very much and all the capillaries were broken. The rupture of the blood vessels was caused by an increase in temperature that couldn't be natural. The liver, normally dark and red, was completely yellow, caused by a high fever. All the blood vessels were yellow, too. With all the blood vessels broken, the animal started bleeding inside and lost so much blood that 48 hours later the amount of blood he had circulating was insufficient and he died of a heart at- tack. When we took the skin off the dog, we didn't see any marks. He didn't have any bruises or anything, nor was the hair burned. The conclusion was that something very hot caused this.\" On the morning after the incident, the underside of Mr. MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 286 February 1992"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"Tonna's right arm, which he had put up to shield his eyes, began hurting. Several days later, Dr. Bruning Herrera, a friend of the Tonna's, and a physician in Salto, paid the fami- ly a personal visit. Tonna confided that he wasn't feeling well and Herrera examined him. He found that the underside of Tonna's right arm was very red and after being told about the UFO incident, decided the irritation was caused by some kind of radiation. Eventually the ailing arm cleared up with no lingering aftereffects. Later, Tonna and his farmhands found a dozen or more mysterious dark green circles in pastures some distance from the house and farm buildings. Most measured about 35 feet across, while several were nearly 200 feet across. One 35-foot circle about two miles from the farmhouse had three circular impressions forming a triangle in the center of the ring, the impressions being about 10 feet apart. The small rocks inside the circle were darker on the top than on the sides and bottoms, and appeared to have been burned. (The APRO Bulletin, August 1977.

Pratt is a former editor of the Mufon UFO Journal.) 1982 • Aubre Brogden was driving home along Vermont 36 from St. Albans at about 9 o'clock on a clear mid-February night. \"I was about a mile and a half out of Bakersfield, Ver- mont when I saw a large, white light moving slowly, quite low in the sky,\" she said. \"At first I thought it was a plane about to land, so I flashed my car headlights to warn it off the road. And then it started coming towards me.\" As the ob- ject got closer, Brogden was able to discern it was triangular in shape. Then she lost sight of the object. When she turned into her driveway she was a little more than taken aback by the sight of the glowing triangle in her own backyard. \"It was just hovering there, about 25 feet away from me,\" she said. \"I got out of the car, picked up my two bags of groceries and started toward the house. It was obviously watching me.\" Feeling fairly panicked, Brogden then began running for the house, and in the process dropped her grocery bags. \"I looked down at the bags, then up at the sky. The thing was then mov- ing right over my head, making absolutely no sound. And it was much bigger than I'd thought; maybe as big as a foot- ball field.\" She ran in the house and locked the door. The UFO moved away noiselessly. She would not go outside for the groceries. The next morning the UFO was nowhere to be seen and the groceries had frozen onto the snow.

When William Moore told only a small part of this story at the 1989 MUFON Symposium in Las Vegas, it created an uproar that continues today. Since that time, rumors, allegations, accusations, claims and counter- claims have so bombarded the UFO grapevine that no one knows what to believe. Now Moore, producer- director Jaime Shandera, and ex-Special Agent of the USAF's Office of Special Investigations Richard Doty, three of those most in a position to know what really happened and what the government's involvement was, have joined forces to tell their tale. The Scientist, the Government and UFOs; Personal Recollections of the Paul Bennewitz Affair goes straight to the heart of the government's involvement with UFOs. It's an upsetting and revealing story that is going to raise a lot of eyebrows. If you thought the controversy was about to blow over, think again.

In the November issue, Ann Druffel titles her piece \" 'Missing Fetus' Case Solved,\" and though her research is commendable, her use of the word \"solved\" is highly misleading. Like Ms. Druffel, I also have firsthand knowledge of the \"Morgana\" case, though I've never spoken to the \"Dr. Levine\" who conducted the D&C on the patient. Neither Ms. Druffel nor I have spoken to \"Dr. Holland,\" the perinatologist whose \"crown/rump\" measurements of what he called a \"fetus\" are supportive of the original missing fetus interpretation of the data. Despite the fact that many other missing fetus cases remain truly inexplicable, Dr. Levine presented Ms. Druffel with an apparently plausible medical explanation for this particular report. But in her piece on Morgana and her family, Ms. Druf- fel also outlined an extraordinary list of their previous UFO experiences — entities in their bedrooms, paralysis, ground traces, a small, mysterious, untraceable \"nurse\" in the hospital room just before the D&C, and so on — all of which may help to resolve this case in a less prosaic fashion than Ms. Druffel's readers have been led to expect. As one might imagine, Dr. Levine has virtually no knowledge of these phenomena, and so quite naturally he re- jects any UFO cause for the \"no fetal parts\" reports from the pathologist. Since he feels he has a plausible prosaic ex- planation for the missing fetus, he prefers his theory to any UFO-connected \"paranormal\" explanation. He may well be right. He may also be quite wrong. Given all the circumstances of the ongoing Morgana case, we simply do not know for certain what actually happened. Morever, with one of Dr. Levine's assertions I take strong exception. He states that any \"physician\" encountering a [missing fetus] would be anxious to talk about the case, because legally and medically he'd want to show that he did not do anything wrong.\" In fact, obstetricians are a very com- mon target for malpractice suits, and it has not been easy for them to prove to a jury of laymen that they bear no personal responsibility when pregnancy-related tragedies occur. Therefore, it seems to me that something as final and incom- prehensible as the disappearance of a patient's fetus while she was under a doctor's care might easily precipitate a defen- sive medical coverup rather than a spate of truth-telling. Over the years, the thousands of letters I've received sug- gest that the mysterious paranormal experiences of military officers, airline pilots, doctors, police, scientists and other mainstream professionals are more often covered up than \"eagerly talked about\" to colleagues, employers and superior officers. In fact, certain details of the Morgana case — details which involve Dr. Levine and which unfortunately I cannot disclose — support that assertion quite specifically. In the light of these many and various uncertainties, I hope that Ann Druffel, my respected colleague and friend, will join me in asserting that this intriguing case, as it stands, remains most definitely unsolved. LETTERS In the December issue of the MUFON Journal, Forest Crawford writes about his in- teresting and controversial \"Ask the Aliens\" research program. Unfortunately, he does not explain exact- ly how and where the abductees involved in this research were able to question the aliens. How much of this information was channelled in the traditional way? How much was \"in- tuited\"? How much arrived in a dreamlike state and how much was elicited during abductions, while the receiver was physically aboard a UFO? The degree of validity we ascribe to such messages will undoubtedly be affected by these circumstances. In a special report I wrote and distributed last year to the members of IF, the Intruders Foundation, I dealt with the prob- lem of alien deception. In one important example, two young women, arriving home inexplicably late from a party in Washington D.C., remembered having come upon a brightly- lit, six-car pile-up of wrecked automobiles, with no occupants, witnesses or emergency vehicles in sight. Subsequently, investigation, hypnotic regression and sim- ple common sense revealed that there never had been an aban- doned six-car pile-up in the middle of a deserted intersec- tion at two that morning. What had happened is this: a vir- tually identical but false image had been, as it were, fed into the minds of the two young women as a screen memory to conceal the abduction of one of them. They were both made to remember the brightly-lit, hovering UFO as a string of wrecked, passengerless cars, all with their headlights ablaze. Similarly, identical but deceptive \"answers\" to religious, cosmic or merely technical questions may very well be placed in the minds of various abductees, leading us wrongful- ly to infer the truthfulness of this special information. Chan- nelled material of all kinds is notoriously unreliable, whether it comes from the \"Ishtar Command,\" from Billy Meier, from small, gray humanoids, or even from Marlin Fitzwater himself. Mr. Crawford could construct an equally persuasive arti- cle based soley upon various statements and answers to UFO questions received by the public from U.S. government sources. And, like the information he has presented from alleged alien sources, it will probably contain a tangled web of disinformation, truth and outright lies. The safest course is this: never believe a thing you are told by either an alien or a government source. Each side has demonstrated a capaci- ty for deception, and each has a vested interest in controlling what we perceive as truth. Instead, each of us must develop a personal, highly critical truth-detecting system, and refuse to defer automatically to either alien or government \"authorities.\" — Budd Hopkins Dear Editor: In response to my friend and colleague Budd Hopkins, I would like to note several factors in the Van Klausen case: 1.) Morgana Van Klausen has a good deal of conscious memory concerning her entity experience and most research- MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 286 February 1992"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"ers feel that hypnotic regression in such cases is unwise. Morgana, at present, prefers to let things lie. She has used resistance techniques to discourage further entity contact and is now leading a normal life. 2.) While hypnosis sometimes helps recover memories, there is always the danger of confabulation (unconscious embellish- ment). Any \"memories\" which surface will probably be a mix- ture of truth and unconscious invention, no matter how skilled the hypnotist and how sincere the subject. Hypnotic regres- sion, at best, is a supplemental tool. There is also the possibility of telepathic leakage between hypnotist and subject. This has been established in parapsychological experiments, and I plan to write more about this in the future. 3.) Budd writes, \"Despite the fact that many other 'missing fetus' cases remain truly inexplicable ...\" as if these cases are fact. There is no case in the literature where a true \"missing fetus\" has been verified. I wrote \"Missing Fetus Solved\" to persuade other researchers to document suspected \"missing fetus\" cases. Only when such claims are proven, can they be accepted as fact. 4.) Dr. Levine's statement that true \"missing fetus\" cases would promptly be written up in medical journals surprised me as much as it did Budd. Such cases would be interesting anomalies, but they have to be proven to exist before any credi- ble case can be made that \"UFO entities\" cause them. 5.) Witnesses who think they have a \"missing fetus\" situa- tion need the perserverance and fortitude displayed by Morgana Van Klausen. The fact that my co-investigator on this case, Georgeann Cifarelli, is a physician's wife was most helpful. She knew how patients can obtain copies of their medical records. Physicians are obliged to provide copies if patients request them and give written permission. This task shouldn't be left to investigators. It is the witnesses' job; it is also their job to persuade their physicians to consult with researchers and to assure them they will not file malpractice claims. 6.) To my mind, the case of Morgana's \"missing\" fetus is solved; all the best evidence indicates it was a missed abor- tion, misunderstood by the witness because of the physicians' imprecise terminology and incomplete explanations. If evidence to the contrary is later proved to exist, I will be the first one to say so. The investigation of Morgana's many ex- periences continues, and we cannot predict the future. — Ann Druffel Dear Editor: Following my piece in the December Journal of the English Hoax Update (written Sept. 21), I think some further updating is needed. The elusive \"MBF Services\" still cannot be positively identified despite early indications of a connection with \"MBF Consultancy\" which has a registered address in Shepton Mallet. The Director of this MBF, Dr. Andrew Clifford, whose scientific research is largely for the British Ministry of Defense and is of a confidential nature, has since then denied to me that he has any connection with \"MBF Services\" or with the Today newspaper, where Doug & Dave's 'confession' first appeared. Certainly \"MBF Services\" is not a listed press agency. Today deputy editor Lloyd Turner said that MBF Services was \"just an agency that handled the details for us, that's all ... just an ordinary press agency, a freelance agency ... they put us in touch with these people [Doug & Dave] so they own the copyright.\" This conversation was taped and cannot be disputed. However, further inquires to Today caused such em- barrassment that reporter Graham Brough stated on November 4, when put on the spot by Pat Delgado at a meeting, \"that MBF Services was just a joke. We made it up.\" Quite clearly either Brough or Turner is lying. The suspicion that the Doug & Dave story is part of a deliberate disinformation campaign remains as strong as ever, but it will be exceedingly difficult to pin the scam on any visible government agency. This is something which we an- ticipated, and obviously Today are not going to tell us the truth of the matter. Some other reporters are interested, but of course dog doesn't eat dog. Moreover, most of the press in this country still treat the Circles with derision, like they have always treated UFOs. Even the remarkable discovery of 13 radioisotopes, which do not occur naturally, in a Wiltshire pictogram by Michael Chorost and Marshall Dudley seems to be of no interest to the impenetrably skeptical British Press! — George Wingfield Shepton Mallet, Somerset Dear Editor: In Bob Oechsler's article in the Jan. 1992 issue, he complains because J.R. Johnson did not contact him to get Oechsler's comments before publicly criticizing his so-called research with Adm. B.R. Inman. Oechsler, in publishing a counterfeit letter purportedly written to me by a nonexistent USAF of- ficer (\"Maj. Thomas Shively\") without trying to contact me to try to verify its authenticity, is guilty of that which he ac- cuses Johnson. Oechsler also read the letter at an earlier UFO conference and implied it was authentic. Even cursory examination of the letter reveals that its \"Department of the Air Force\" letterhead is significantly fainter than the typewritten text, showing the letterhead is a hoax photocopy. And there are serious discrepancies in the contents, as I detailed in my letter of Dec. 24 to Oechsler, to which he has not responded as of Jan. 11. Oechsler claims that \"Maj. Thomas Shively\" is a pseud- onym, to protect the identity of the USAF officer. I have challenged him to produce authentic USAF letter in which the writer has used a pseudonym to protect his/her identity.

We made several attempts and left messages but he didn't return the calls. And he never answered the letters. We also asked Stanton Friedman for tran- scripts, which he promised but never sent. We were thus forced to advance the investigation in other arenas. It is not true that we spent very little time investigating Gerald's account. We have more than 70 sources on the case, including nearly every living archaeologist who was on the Plains of San Agustin dur- ing the summer of 1947. Carpenter suggests that our tape is only 26 minutes long, and has even supplied a copy of Anderson's phone bill \"prov- ing\" this. The problem here is that my tape of the interview runs 51 minutes, and since I have the tape to prove it, it sug- gests the bill Anderson submitted was doctored. While Carpenter is so busy stepping on the ants he has missed the elephants about to run over Anderson, Friedman and him. This means, quite simply, that he has attempted to divert the discussion to points of trivia, overlooking the ma- jor discrepancies in the Anderson story. First, Barney Barnett told others that he was the first on the crash site and watched the archaeologist approach. Anderson placed him there last. Barnett mentioned the archaeologists but never said a word about a family with two small children. And finally, Barnett placed the crash site either to the north- west of Magdalena or between Magdalena and Datil and not near Horse Springs which is more than 60 miles away. (We believe that Barnett was actually on the Corona site.) Second, Carpenter changes the date of the event to suit his current scenario. The diary submitted by Anderson clearly puts the date of the event as July 5. The diary kept by Ruth Barnett shows that it was impossible for Barnett to have been there on July 5, and since Anderson said he saw Barnett on the site, there is a major problem. Next we are told it was July 3, but Barnett was in the office and not on the Plains then. Now, we are told it was July 2. If Anderson was there, why is the diary date wrong? Speaking of the diary, it is interesting that no one mentions that the paper was available in 1947, but the ink was no older than 1974. Rather than have this suggest'another discrepancy, we are told that it is a copy of the \"real\" diary. If it was not produced as the \"real\" diary in the first place, why would it be tested? And who laboriously copies a diary in the era of the Xerox machine? There are other problems with this diary that Carpenter con- veniently overlooks. For example, the diary clearly states they were close to Magdalena when they found the ship. Anderson found a site near Horse Springs. Why would the diary list a site more than 60 miles away when Horse Springs was less than a mile from the site? Anderson identified the lead archaeologist as Dr. Buskirk. He even supplied an indentikit sketch of Buskirk. We found Dr. Buskirk and he has said repeatedly that he was not on the Plains of San Agustin in July 1947. That means either Ander- son or Buskirk is fabricating, and I'm betting that Dr. Buskirk is telling the truth. He has the documentation to back up his claim, and he has living witnesses to his version. Anderson also said that the archaeologists were from the University of Pennsylvania. We asked if he was sure and he said that he thought so. Carpenter's comment is splitting hairs. It was Anderson who introduced the University of Pennsylvania into the discussion, and he has reinforced it since then. Dr. Buskirk was working out of the University of New Mex- ico. In fact, there were no field teams from the University of Pennsylvania working in New Mexico in 1947. This is another area where Anderson's story does not check out. Doesn't that raise a few eyebrows? There are no first hand witnesses to anything on the Plains in the summer of 1947. We have interviewed (or been pro- vided with copies or notes of interviews with) every living archaeologist from the Plains. There is not a single one who remembers or who saw anything. Not one. Robert Drake, working with Wesley Hurt and Dan McKnight, remembers hearing a cowboy tell of a crash, but both Hurt and McKnight remember nothing of that. Besides, Drake's information is second hand. Dave Farr owns the ranch where Anderson claims the ship crashed. In 1947, Farr lived 11 miles away and he knows nothing of it. He spoke to more than 30 long time residents of Horse Springs and not one had any first hand knowledge. One man from Magdalena seems to remember someone talk- ing about it some time ago. One of the things that Carpenter does that I don't under- stand, is change my transcript to reflect what he wants to believe. Anderson told me that the eyes were milky blue, im- plying that they were light blue. Carpenter quotes from the transcript (not the tape itself) \"not blue like blue in human eyes.\" Finish the quote, John! \"... not blue like blue in human eyes, but blue like (long pause) sort of a milky blue.\" There is no trouble understanding him on the tape, but Carpenter changes the words because he doesn't want to have to answer the question of the changing eye color. (Note that Carpenter has a copy of our transcript, but has yet to send us any of his information.) It was Anderson who talked about blood and I did ask him a leading question, a perfectly acceptable interrogation techni- que. I did it on purpose and he walked right into the trap, telling me that the blood was red. I freely admit that I put in the moaning comment where it clearly did not belong. The oozing blood is the result of a typographical error. But these are minor points compared to the major discrepancies that have developed in the Ander- son story. Anderson told me that three.-were dead and one was injured. Now he is saying that two were dead, one dying and one uninjured. Anderson told me that the eyes were milky blue, but now both he and Carpenter insist that he said murky MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 286 February 1992"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"blue, without ever having heard my tape. Anderson said that Barnett was the last to arrive, but Barnett told others he was first. Anderson described a patch worn by the soldiers he saw, but we have not been able to find any American military unit to have ever worn such a patch. Anderson told me that there was no dome on top and now says that there was. Anderson claimed that they had been in search of moss agate, but the experts in New Mexico, including Robert Weber (notice that Carpenter and crew never name names but we always do?), say that moss agate is not available there. The dates Ander- son supplied for the events don't track, and the diary blew up when the ink was found to be no older than 1974. Ander- son (according to Friedman) was asked on the polygraph ex- am if he had ever seen Dr. Buskirk after 1947 and answered no. We've put them in the same high school. (Carpenter wonders how we could know what was asked, because, ac- cording to him, neither he nor Friedman had access to the particular questions. Friedman told us he had been asked.) When some of these points were raised, Friedman answered that there was disinformation in the diary. Does this make any sense? Who would write a diary and put in \"disinforma- tion?\" Isn't that just a fancy way of saying that the diary is filled with fabrication? Would the disinformation include the temperature in Albuquerque on July 4, 1947? According to the diary, it was \"110 degrees no shade.\" The weather records show that it was only 95. Carpenter has suggested that we were premature in releas- ing our information but that's not the case. We carried out an extensive investigation trying to verify the facts as outlined by Anderson and have been unable to do so. There is no first hand corroboration to his story and the facts he's given do not track with the independent sources available. Carpenter has said that he wants \"to preserve the truth and correct the record.\" I suggest that he do it. Look at the ma- jor discrepancies and answer some of those major questions. It is Anderson who must prove the veracity of his statements, because he is the one diverting from the norm. If these can't be adequately addressed, then the only possible conclusion is that Anderson was never there. Yes, I freely admit that I called the Anderson story a hoax on a Kansas City radio station (KCMO) in June 1991. Just to set the record straight, I do not deny I said it. I deny that my conclusion was hasty and I wouldn't have expressed it publicly except that Carpenter and his team had already published several articles about Anderson. Why are they allowed the privilege of publication, but we are not supposed to ask our difficult questions or announce our conclusions? The interesting thing here is that I don't have to conceal my sources. I name all the names. Let Carpenter do the same so that free-thinking, intelligent individuals can search for the truth themselves. I have nothing to hide because I have been very careful. Let them, Carpenter, Anderson and Fried- man do the same. Let's just see who is right. — Kevin D. Handle Cedar Rapids, LA Dear Editor: Being a recent newcomer to MUFON (February '91), a long-time associate of — and occasional analyst for — CUFOS, and modest supporter of FUFOR, I am led to this comment: I'm troubled by what I perceive to be an intensifying destructive trend. It's my impression that in recent years the ranks of UFOlogy, traditionally sporting an unalloyed mix of conflicting individual hypotheses and conclusions, are in- creasingly resorting to personal allegations and rebuttals couched in vituperative and deprecatory tones. In recent issues of the MUFON Journal , for instance, ongo- ing interchanges laced with personal animus pit Schmitt/Ran- dle against Shandera, and Shandera against Schmitt/Randle; also, Beckjord vs. Stacy, Stacy vs. Beckjord, Walters and Mac- cabee vs. the Salisberrys, the Salisberrys vs. Maccabee, Good vs. Johnson, and Hopkins vs. Strieber — to mention just a few at random. This is not to deprecate the essential need to identify er- rors and unwarranted conclusions appearing in published works. Certainly exposure and correction of error in the endless search for elusive truth is a paramount mission of UFOlogy. But must we do it through personal invective? Many of the \"versuses\" noted above are far more subjective than objective. They're rife with condescension and wounded ego; with derisive personal attacks on scholarship and defensive retorts in support of pet hypotheses — even going so far as to question one's veracity because of minor grammatical and typographical lapses. This begins to resemble the personal attacks resorted to by some of UFOlogy's most vocal critics when objective argument fails them. And it consumes much valuable and limited space in our publications; space that would better be used more objectively. Clearly no one has all the answers. And no one will, so long as those who have disparate elements of the truth jealous- ly guard their own turfs in an adversarial way. How can you unite with another researcher in seeking the collective truth when you have antagonized him? Perhaps if we were to put cooperation above competition and controversy, for a change, we would all benefit. Although absolute objectivity is im- possible to achieve, we can come much closer than we're now doing. — R.H. Coddington Richmond, VA Letters of comment should be neatly typed and doublespaced.

Webb March 1992 Bright Planets (Evening Sky): Little Mercury, nearest planet to the Sun, may be seen at its best evening appearance of the year during the first half of the month. Look for a tiny orange dot low in the western sky after sunset. Brilliant Jupiter (magnitude -2.5), in Leo, rises in the E around sunset and advances westward across the southern sky during the night. Bright Planets (Morning Sky): Saturn (0.8) joins Venus (-3.9) and Mars (1.2) in the early dawn, all quite low in the ESE. The lunar crescent lies above Mars on the 1st, to the left of Venus on the 2nd, and above Saturn on the 29th. Saturn and Mars are less than half a degree apart on March 6. Jupiter sets in the West around sunrise. Asteroid Vesta A minor planet or asteroid should be barely visible to the naked eye in a dark rural sky for several weeks around its opposition date. Vesta, 4th asteroid discovered and the 2nd largest (335 miles), is exactly opposite the Sun on March 8. At this time it brightens to magnitude 6.1 and is about 125 million miles from Earth. The dim object on the 8th is located at R.A. llh 38m, Dec. +14° 41' (2000 coor- dinates). This places Vesta in Leo not far from the star Denebola, the lion's tail. The asteroid's motion against the stars can be followed with binoculars from night to night. Sky & Telescope will publish a finder chart to help locate the starlike object. Moon Phases: New moon — March 4 First quarter — March 11 Full moon — March 18 Last quarter — March 25 The Stars: During midevening hours the bright stars of winter slide into the SW, while the springtime constellations ascend the eastern heavens -- Leo the Lion (with temporary resident Jupiter), Bootes the Herdsman, and Virgo the Maiden. In this 1st month of spring, the sky is full of blazing stars; ten Ist-magnitude stars can be counted at 9 PM. Rising in the NE about 7:30 PM in midmonth, orange-tinted Arcturus, in Bootes, is one of those celestial objects caus- ing false UFO reports when low in the sky. Arcturus is the 3rd brightest nighttime star (after Sirius and Canopus). The Big Dipper climbs high in the NE, turning its bowl almost upside down. The Pointer Stars on the end of the bowl point nearly to Polaris the North Star. END NOTES Our feature article this issue was originally going to be a lengthy report by Michael Chorost and Marshall Dudley detailing the discovery of 13 radionuclides in a crop circle near Beckhampton, England. But last minute number crunching (and checking) has forced us to postpone it until a later date. Instead, readers will find John White's \"Aliens Among Us — A UFO Con- spiracy Hypothesis in a Religious Mode.\" Personally, this editor finds such theories almost whol- ly untenable and unprovable, for reasons too long and complex to enter into in the short space available. Suf- fice it to say that few issues are more inherently con- troversial than UFOs and alleged abductions, but that among that small handful religion certainly ranks as a top contender. We don't see what is to be gained by layer- ing a hypothetical \"Satan\" atop an already confusing situation, but so be it. Some readers are no doubt in- terested in this particular viewpoint and here they have it, and in great depth at that. If White's article stimulates some rigorous thinking on the subject, fine; we hope it does. But if the issue of religion itself — and per- sonal interpretations of same — become the central issue of focus, then the Journal may bow out of this one ear- ly. We have enough problems trying to decide what a UFO is without trying to arbitrate the religious beliefs of our readers! Controversy reigns supreme in this issue's letters col- umn, too. We applaud Mr. Coddington's comments in particular, and wish we could see an easy way out. Un- fortunately, given the nature of the beast, nothing presents itself as a ready solution. Give and take must remain an integral part of the process of interpreting, and perhaps even of discovering, the multivaried UFO phenomenon. Any attempt to eliminate different points of view about this or that particular case (or witness, or photo, etc.) is obviously doomed to failure from the start. But while we can't ask everyone to march in lock-step behind a single hypothesis or approach, we can ask that those with variant views couch their objections in civil, courteous language. We can ask that researchers confine their remarks to the investigation and not the investigator. And we can ask that individuals continue to share their find- ings and let the facts speak for themselves. We can argue for cooperation and against personal discordance, and we do so now.

Operation Right to Know Operation Right to Know is a unique experiment that will be conducted in Washington, D.C. to further publicize UFOs and urge the U.S. government to disclose additional UFO secrets. The most convenient format to share with our readers is to quote from an advanced flyer announcing the event. Under no circumstances, whatsoever, could MUFON support this demonstration, however we will be very curious to know how effective such an ambitious, innovative program was in achiev- ing its goal and the degree of acceptance by the public and media. \"A demonstration promoting a greater public inquiry into the UFO mystery and urging the disclosure of government UFO secrets has been scheduled for March 21 through March 31, 1992 on the sidewalk across the street from the White House, Washington, D.C. \"Operation Right to Know is organized by private citizens and operates independently of all UFO organizations. The message presented by Operation Right to Know asserts that there is a high-level cover-up of information and encourages the disclosure of that information. It is suspected that a small number of persons at the highest level of government have been granted need-to-know access to information confirm- ing the presence of extraterrestrial visitors on this planet. We feel that fact can be safely disclosed to the public. \"Operation Right to Know will offer at the White House sidewalk demonstration site a comprehensive briefing package for educational use by journalists and other interested per- sons. Briefing material will reflect different aspects of UFO events and of the investigations into them. No particular point of view characterizing the exact nature of the cover-up, and of the alien presence, will be adopted by Operation Right to Know. \"It is the intent of Operation Right to Know to operate in legal, non-disruptive manner and that all activities organized shall remain free of hostile behaviors and fanatical agendas.\" Organizers Ed Komarek, Jr. Route 3, Box 1076, Thomasville, GA 31792 Mike Jamieson 554 Randolph St., #2 Napa, CA 94559 The organizers have a written permit from the Washington, DC Chief of Police to conduct the educational table display. In order to evaluate the impact of this demonstration upon the printed media, I am inviting and encouraging every reader to send me all newspaper clippings, identifying the newspaper, city and date. May I thank you in advance for your help? Current Case Log The Current Case Log initiated by Dan Wright several years ago has been reinstated by Donald M. Ware, Eastern Regional Director. These are summarized recent UFO in- vestigations that are rated significant and of definite interest to members to show continued UFO activity. The four regional directors accepted the responsibility for screening and evaluating the reports in their regions from the state direc- tors when Dan Wright took a temporary leave of absence near- ly a year ago. Mr. Wright is going to devote his primary time to computerizing the MUFON UFO file starting this month, therefore he will not be involved in the evaluation of reports. Since Don Ware has been the only regional director fulfill- ing this responsibility, there are probably several reasons why the other three have not done so. (1) The state directors are not screening the reports submitted to them; (2) The state directors may not be forwarding investigated reports to their regional directors; (3) The regional directors are not currently processing the reports as received; and (4) If they are pro- cessing the reports currently, they are not submitting the com- pleted reports and summarized current case log to MUFON headquarters. Readers are asking the question why only eastern states in- vestigated reports are being published in the Journal. This problem can be corrected by having all State Directors and Regional Directors review the established procedures and responding accordingly. If there is a question about the pro- cedure please contact Walt Andrus. Thank you for your cooperation.
