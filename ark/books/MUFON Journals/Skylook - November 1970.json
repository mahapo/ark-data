On the 4th of, Septcmb~r, ncar !:sxiltan, Nrs Otto Dennison stepped out of- her farm hope to see why the 'dog mes barking. Alnost i~nrn~di'at - ely she saw an object in the southwest sky which-she thou-ght, on firsi glance., to be the noon. Quickly, however, she notlced it was movlr,g towzrd a farmhouse less than one eighth of a mile west. Th€re it stopped just above the trees and began making errBtic movem~n.ts 'which resembled a kite which h2d no tail,' jerking 2nd shifting in every di- rection. The light being emitted from this roulld configuration was' basically yellow to yellow-orange, Mrs. Dennison wondered whet this thing' nes and whet she shohld do abou>,it. Her husbmd w~s asleep 2nd tht neighbors h2d no llght,'so she assumed they-were not home. She went inside for a few minutes while pondering the situption, After a while she returned to her yard but did-not see anything until she turned-to the east. Now the Tight was bouncing above the f~rmhouse to the east, mentioned above: No lights were on at thzt home and she hter le~rned they they were, away at the time. She ent.ered her home apain%for a period of time and when she again looked for the light, it could not be scen. It had-be~n in the are2 zt least a half hour. -. About 3 :00 a.m. on Monday, October 5th) near K~hoka, \"MO., Robert Benj2min md Jackie, Jones sttopped their auto when they s2w a \"blue moon.'', Not only the color ceuglit their-attention, but on further' observ~tion, they could tell it 'w~s moving slowly. They got ou< 'of the c2r, sensing something very unusual. The night was clezr and tho sky dark except for stars and this pale blue circle which fooked'likc ''a piece of plain blu'e paper cut into 2 circle and piaced in the skyl'' Aftelr- two or three minutes a tzil, or streak, of yelxowish iight strerked skywcrd from the blue ball. Thc ball f~ded away, but the- streak remained for znother three minutes or more until <, lt also,f,zded away. Then on Wednesdey, Oct. 14, Pks. Raymond Tcdd, who wes driving from Hamilton -to 'C~rth~gc, Ill., noticed a. brlght star in the +?,st, Aft'cr awhile this star seemed neprer the moon which was in the e;tcst southeast. Now wztching more clo'se.ly a's 'she drove, she could cleerly see the light wgs boving from left to right of the moon, Mrs. Todd pulled off on the shculder: ar,d got out z;s she mar-ed Carthage. The bright light was now passing overhead. Behind the bright l~ght she could see two rectangular, dimly lit ?reas which looked like windows; And ,i following a shar t -dis Lance behind, but lower, were two more \"win- dows.\" The back set changed position enough as she w~tched that it is thought they belonged to 3 separ2te unit. As the licht traveled away to the west, it grEw dimmcr snd soon disappc~1.cd.

The chapter on UFOs says that such objects have been reported for almost 50,000 years and that \"the entire phenomenon could'be psycholo- gical but this is quite doubtfulff because of some of the reliable wit- nesses who have spotted them. \"It could also be due to known and unknown phenomena'. . . but this is a1s.o questionable,\" the book says, ffThis leaves us with the unpleasmt possibility of alien visitors or at least alien-controlled UFOs. However, the data are n~t well correlated and suggests at least three and maybe four groups of aliens, possibly at different stages of development.. \"This, too, is difficult to accept: It implies the existgnce of intelligent life on a majority of planets in our solar system or a surprisingly strong interest in earth by members of other solar sys- tems. lf The textbook szys,lfThe best thing to do is to keep an open and skeptical mind and not take an extreme position.'l Source: St. Louis ffBost-Dispatch'f, Oct. 11, 1970.

Although'the atomic absorption spectrophotometer is a highly sens:- tive instrument which will measure concentrations of most \"trace\" metals as low as ;n:lrts per million or parts per billion, the flame photometer -does a b et$er j.~b of analyzing for the alkali metals ( I-i . thium, sodium, r-tasci3im, cesium), boron, uranium, and the rare earth metals. Dr. Utke explahs that to l!cJe a flame photometer one sprays a, solv.. tion of the sample-into a-gas/air flame and thus atomizes it. The atcar are raised to an \"excited\" state and when they llrelaxl:, they emit a charactistic light radi2tion, in proportion to their concentration, which can then be measured. He po-ints out that the ~ethods mentioned will only give a qualitativ- and quantitative plcture of the sample--in other words, whzt elerl?ents CI compounds'are present and how much. More sop'histicated information can be gathc-red- by the use'of x-ray diffraction, nuclear magnetic resonanze techniques, and mass spectroscopy. We are' told the x-ray diffraction analysis can be applied -to most elements and compounds---the sample is bombarded with x--r~ys which are deflected by the atons,and molecules present, in a pattern whicki is characteristic of the sample's structure. The p2tt~rn is recorded on a photographic plate and then used for qualitative and quantitative an.- alysis, and more important--ehe pattern can be used' to tell somethinrl; about the atomic structure of the sample.

WHY I Believe in UFO's . .. . By'Bi,ll Finch ' i ~rie, Pennsylvsnia, isn't the best spot in %be world for observi-s: the sky. There is much more.cloud.cover than ~2.1-kine.

A beautiful, bright sunny dzy combined wjth the desire to see one of the newf~ngled pirnl~nes ceused me to loo~,closely 2t two big-h flvin.: objects lezving vapor trails. Expecting to see a pair of. jets, 1 wzs su- pris2ed to note the objects crepting the white streaks in an otherwise azure sky were disc shaped, , Disappointed - thzt it wzsnlt swept bzck wings., I almost ignored the discs. 1 he$ other things on my mind. Then .I spotted two more streaks in the sky. They were the .swept back wingc'd planes I, hzd wanted to see! wesnlt until I reelized they seemed to be pursuing the two discs th?t my mind snepped to full attention. I was watching two jets pursue two flying saucers! . v The two disc shpped obje<cts made an abrupt right, angle. turn, their trail being very clearly defined. The two jets swung on the dizgonal and 'rapidly closed on the two discs. - I idly wodered ~f I might see a dogfight and watched intently. As the two jets..approached the discs, there was a sadden increase in the speed of the circulzr shsped objec::: The vapor trail became pinpointed, and the discs rapidly disappeareC from my view. Evidently the also disapbe~rtd from thc view of the pilots of tha. jets, for therk$~~or streaks all over the 'sky as they apparently searched for the round sh~ped objects.

By F~rk Herbstritt- - The c.onstellation Cassiopeia is near the meridian this month. The brightess stair; in Casslopeia form a Lettcr W. The objects listed should be discernible in a 6-inch telescope, and some can be seen without pptical aid. The brightest star is Alpha dass- iopeia, magnitude 1.23. It has a 9th magnitude chpanion, discovered- by William .Herschel in 1781. The distance to Alpha >is 150 light years, Gamma Cassiopeia is the central star in the W. It is a varizble and is about 100 light years distant. Eta Cassiopeia is a double star of mag- nitudes 3 and 7 and colors of yellow and red. Mu Cassiopeia is a' 5th magnitude yellow star and is 26 lipht years away, A -Niew Planetary System A recent issue of the St. Louis vfPost-Dispatchn contained an articl~ about the formation of a new planetary system. A British astronomer:. Zdenek Kqpal, says he has found a planetary system forming around a large star, Epsilon Aurigae. This star is 20 times as big as the' s:m and is 5000 light years away. The unusual feature is the low tempera:-' ture, about 500 degrees, of the ring of matter surrounding the ,star and extending about 2 billion miles out.
