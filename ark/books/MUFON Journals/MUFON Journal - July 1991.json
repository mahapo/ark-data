O n Monday, May 20, 1991 I received a phone call from Robert Gribble at approximate- ly 7:40 p.m. He informed me that he had been unable to reach Walt Andrus or Tennessee State Director John Ko- mar at the time, and so had called me to ask if I was aware of the UFO in- cidents within the Dandridge, Ten- nessee area. At the time I was unaware of the ac- tivity. It should be noted that the sightings were first known to be wide- ly reported publicly by WBIR TV (Channel 10) news in Knoxville, Ten- nessee that morning, and were picked up nationally. Unfortunately, I watch another station for news, which had not made mention of it on the evening news nor the morning news, to which I had listened to in part. After receiving the basics from Robert Gribble, I went back to the amateur radio net that I was then par- ticipating in. This was the Oak Ridge Isochronous Observation Network (ORION) which meets every other week at that time. This group has the subject of UFOs as one of its interests. Informing the net that I had just received a UFO report, I asked if anyone on it had heard of any reports in the area. None had at that time. After getting no response I began try- ing to call the witness, Larry Thurman, and at approximately 8:15 p.m. I managed to do so. Mr. Thurman agreed to meet with me the next day and told me the basics of the case, and also of the Mills' crop circle case, and he agreed to take me to the circle site. It should be noted that until the time of the crop circle report, the Thurmans did not know the Mills. They are several miles apart by road, though closer by air. Due to the fact that Mr. Thurman works part-time with the Sheriffs department, his older sighting was uncovered through same, apparent- ly by the television crew in the wake of the crop circle. The Thurman house is located on the side of a small hill surrounded by other small hills. There are no obviously unusual structures or other terrain features of note. They are close enough to 1-40 that there is a fairly constant level of light noise from it. During the time of the sighting there was no other activity noted to any elec- trical equipment, nor to their small dog, whose location was not known. The sighting was also seen by Mrs. Thur- man and their small son. The video tape had been set aside after the sighting and it took the Thur- mans awhile to find it for the TV crew. They gave it to the crew to take to copy for the news and were supposed to have it mailed back to them the next day. Mr. Thurman instead decided to go pick it up himself. It should be noted that I didn't han- dle the tape itself at first and after hav- ing taken a VCR to their house to tape from their system, made two tapes for myself, one to send in with the report, when they asked for a copy to be made for them while I had the equipment set up. This I had planned for, however at the time I began to think that maybe I should look at the tape itself. A fter all this time the tape still had not had the tab pulled out to prevent accidental erasure. Originally the tape had the previous Christmas day recorded upon it, which is why the Thurmans wanted to keep it initially, and also some cartoons for their son, which were recorded over by the sighting. I pointed this out to the Thurmans and received permission to pull the tab out. They asked me what I thought they should do with the tape and they men- tioned a safety deposit box. I told them that it would be a good idea to place it there. The sighting occurred when Mr. Thurman was taping a plane flying in the area. This is the first object seen on the tape. The second object, which he calls a plane on the tape initially, is the UFO. Although the initial date on the tape is March 10, the later and ac- tual date is March 15, 1991. Mr. Thurman is a self-employed building contractor and Minister for the Church of God. He also works part time for the Sheriffs department and has some of the newer radio gear in his pickup truck, in addition to other scan- ning equipment in his home. Mrs. Thurman is a housewife. Both appeared intelligent and curious about the sighting. Both had previous- ly been aware of the subject of UFOs and crop rings through various televi- sion shows, and have now begun receiv- ing phone calls from as far away as Germany. I then followed Mr. Thurman over to the Mills' home. By the time of my arrival both families had already talked to TV reporters and each other. This is an important point, as they had begun sharing details of the incidents. However, there appeared to be no obvious distortions of the basic details in either group. Both responded to questions with either straight answers or simply stated that they didn't know certain things. The Mills were also slightly sur- prised as to the amount of response that had occurred due to the circle. They also have been receiving calls from many places. It should be noted that they do not wish their address or phone number given out. The Mills' field appears normal at first glance. The circle itself is inside a fenced area away from the home. Across the fence on one side from the circle is a small barn where calves are MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 279 July 1991"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"kept. It was one of these calves that laid down shortly after the circle's appearance. At the first trip there the calf ap- peared okay to myself, though I have no knowledge of such animals. The coat was normal looking with no obvious signs of any injury to a casual glance. The calf was frolicking a little with two other calves and Mr. Mills, who arrived then with medicine for it, said that it was now feeling better. He also said that it had never been sick like that before the circle's appearance. When asked if a vet had looked at it, Mr. Mills responded that an animal couldn't be taken to a vet everytime one got sick. The next day, when we re- turned, he said the animal was a little worse. The night that the Mills heard the sound that they likened to that of a rope being swung about overhead, their dog, a Pomeranian, ran into the house, ap- parently frightened. The circle was found the next day. Mrs. Mills has a bad back and Mr. Mills, several months before, had an in- cident with his heart. Although both walk, they also use a small yard trac- tor/mower to move about upon. The circle itself had a small false outer ring which was created when this vehicle was used to go around it. It also has a path up to its edge on one side caused by the mower driving over it, but not mowing it. The circle itself did not ap- pear to be caused by such a vehicle. In the area of the path, about 10 feet from the circle's edge, was a small piece of white/clear plastic, apparently a sec- tion from a milk jug. Neither of the Mills knew what it was doing there, and it may just have been trash that happen- ed to be there at the time. While it had some cut grass on it, any residue would have likely been washed off by the re- cent rains in the area. Mrs. Mills, who has not been to a doctor, has a rash-like skin condition on both arms. Initially she was the first one to actually go into the circle. She stated that she has no other medical problems than the said bad back. The rash occurred first on one arm and then the other. They were mildly concerned that radiation might be involved. She was sick for several days afterward. On the opposite side of the barn is a junkyard that appears to have around a couple of hundred vehicles. A short distance on the opposite corner of the field is a small cemetery. No one else has reported any strange effects. At the time of my initial site observation there had been heavy rains in the area, so any obvious conditions could have previously been altered. The circle was approximately 24 feet in diameter, depending where on the edge one decided that it began. In the center of the circle was an apparently unaffected tuft of grass approximately 5'/2 feet in diameter. Therefore the grass was actually depressed into a ring formation. U pon looking at the grass itself it was difficult to determine what was the change in the grass due to the unknown cause, and what was changed due to human in- teraction afterward. There was some definite bending to the point of breakage and creasing of the grass. However, most of the grass appeared to have been bent without severe or sharp cracks at any one point; rather it was bent in a smooth arc, near the ground, with no obvious physical change in the plants. There were small yellow buds of a plant that were still alive, though a few of them and a small amount of the grass had turned brown. Considering the amount of physical change in the act of lying down on the ground, this did not appear particularly unusual to me. The several trees, between about 15 and 18 feet high on one side of the fenc- ed corner, showed no obvious signs of disturbance nor change of any type. These were about 40 feet from the edge of the circle. Mr. Thurman identified these as cedars. The grass had a small amount of in- sect life, both within the center tuft and within the ring itself. It did not appear to be any different than that observed in the undisturbed field. When the calves came out, obviously interested in the people, they came up to the closest point allowable by the fence without any noticeable reluctance to be near the ring. The initial Tuesday survey and inter- views were conducted quickly to con- form to the Mills' desire to return to the Thurman home to have a look at the video tape. T he next day I returned with MUFON member and environ- mentalist Charles Hanion and his friend, and video worker Alan, who took % \" video later to be transferred to VHS. An Optoelectronics 3000 frequency meter was available so I tried to see if it would pick up any unusual readings within the circle, but it acted the same within and without, with no noticeable difference, giving random readings on all settings. An external mike from the % \" video camera was moved through the circle without any unusual sounds being pick- ed up. On that Wednesday we noted a small, lively toad in addition to the insects within the circle area. Within the circle were two points that the Mills indicated had first been pointed out to them by the TV crew. Both points appeared to be where the grass had been moved away slightly with only a small area of dirt seen due to that. Neither appeared substantial, only a few inches across, and may have only been where someone had stepped. On Monday, May 27, I notified the Mills that no abnormal amount of radiation had been found within the soil samples. I learned that Mrs. Mills was still feeling ill and that her rashes had temporarily cleared a little, but had then grown worse. I was also told by Mr. Mills that the calf was expected to die and that another had been purchased to replace it. Mr. Mills stated that he had done all that a vet could have done for the calf and that it wouldn't be worth the effort to take it to one. The dog appeared normal. Mr. Mills also relayed a fact that his wife had at first been reluctant to discuss. At the time of the circle's ap- pearance she had also noted two three- sided diamond-like or round marks that she thought might be footprints at the MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 279 July 1991"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"entrance of their barn. He stated that they were no longer there. I then called Mr. Thurman who had had several experiences worthy of note by that time. Several individuals who did not identify themselves had made monetary offers for the video, even though they claimed to only have descriptions of it, not having seen it themselves. One caller offered $50,000 for the video. After Mr. Thurman did a phone in- terview with a Seattle radio station (call letters unknown or forgotten), he received another call from someone he assumed to be from that region who also wished to purchase the tape. When asked, Mr. Thurman joking- ly responded that it would cost $50,000. The man responded seriously and after a few more details said he would come with the money and get it. The radio station then called and told him that someone had called them claiming that they had bought the tape. Mr. Thurman replied that it wasn't sold yet, but that someone wanted to buy it, but when asked, he wouldn't tell them how much was offered because that was a matter between the two of them. The station then asked if $75,000 would buy it, to which Mr. Thurman basically responded something to the effect that the early bird gets the worm. Mr. Thurman has spoken to a lawyer and banker to insure that any possible transaction is properly handled. I ad- vised him to make certain that he had everything pinned down before making any such transaction. Mr. Thurman confirmed that the tape itself is now located in a secure location. Mr. Thurman continues to receive calls from individuals and news organizations that would like to see the tape and interview him. He has also noticed several vehicles in the area that stop or slow down when coming to or past his driveway, but has not been able to gather any details when making a slight effort to identify the plates before the vehicles leave. One of these vehicles is referred to as slightly larger than a Honda Accord and grey in color. Another is a white Chevrolet with white or grey background plates with black lettering. Mr. Thurman also reports that at ap- proximately the same week or shortly after the time of the video taping, he had begun seeing black-colored helicopters, both day and night, several times. These typically occur three at a time and shine lights down. He has not been able to see any markings upon them though they have come close enough for him to believe that he should have been able to do so. Mr. Thurman has also begun hear- ing various clicks upon his phone system. He assumes that his phone is tapped. He has also built what he describes as a simple UFO tester which uses a light bulb lighting up to show a change in magnetism. He offered to show it to me but would rather not describe it over the phone. This detector was dreamed of eight to ten years ago but never built. He con- siders it to be very simple, yet practical. He also stated that Mrs. Thurman has now remembered that she had a dream of a blond-headed woman on a space- ship that had landed, shortly before the video was taped. She recalled this dream after seeing a female blond in- vestigator who was looking into the case. Both families have expressed an in- terest in continuing to be informed of any conclusions that come out of the investigation, which shall be continued as there are several unfinished apsects of the situation. CROP CIRCLE AT MILAN, ILLINOIS Jeff Fischer, Field Investigator Trainee O n 10-20-90, myself, Dan Riley, MD, and Grey Woodman, MD, MUFON investigator, drove to a farm a man named Ed Lawson works for a property owner, on Andulsia and Turkey Hill Roads near Milan, Illinois. We were first able to spot the circle from the road. The field was cut except for the area around the circle. We received permission from a person who worked on the farm to enter the field, and drove approximately 1/4 mile into the field to the circle. The area had been roped off in an ef- fort to keep curiousity seekers out. Many people had stopped on the road to look, and a few had ventured into the field and up to the circle. Only a few stalks now surrounded the circle, because the field had been cut four days earlier. This was when Mr. Lawson first noticed the circle. We all saw that the corn stalks were laying in a clockwise pattern, most broken off at ground level, and some at about 16 inches from the ground. The com was imbedded in the soil such that the outlines of the stalks and leaves were visible in the soft dirt under them. This was consistent at every location we ex- amined. The soil was moist in the cir- cle, as was the soil outside the circle. The marks in the soil seemed too deep to be caused by trampling alone. When we attempted to trample a stalk with our foot, the same result was not found. Soil samples were taken at locations in the center, half way between the center and the edge, the edge, and 6 feet out- side the circle. The results of the testing done on this soil is discussed below. Standing in the center of the circle and looking around 360 degrees, it appeared that the corn was flattened in a spiral pattern, tightening in the middle. None of the soil was marred or scorched except for as described above. It was somewhat compacted, MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 279 July 1991"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Grey Woodman, M.D., State Section Director and Psychiatrist, standing in cornfield circle near Milan, Illinois. and more difficult to dig than we ex- pected. The corn did not have any unusual characteristics other than the fact that it was broken. The stalks were not broken anywhere other than the bot- tom. Approximately one to five percent of the stalks were randomly broken off at around 16 inches and intact at the ground. A grouping of these 16-inch stalks were noticed and measured. They were in the east and west sides of the circle, and were approximately four feet long and spaced in about 10 inches from each edge. Although broken off at around 16 inches, the direction of the fallen stalks were random. Five to six stalks formed each of these rows, and they were within the row as originally planted. The circle measured approximately 49 feet in all directions. Newspaper reports said the circle was 46.5 feet. It was difficult to get an accurate mea- surement due to the nature of broken corn. Some of the corn outside the circle was broken off at a level of around five feet. All these stalks leaned to the north. Analysis of Soil Data The analysis was conducted by a lab which is a division of Corrpro Com- panies in Houston, Texas, which routinely tests soils for the items listed on the report. The company usually is involved in testing for corrosion and corrosion related failures, corrosion be- ing an electrical activity. The premise that these circles may be formed by some sort of natural or unnatural elec- tromagnetic force makes this data significant. Generally, readings like these are consistent within a short distance such as we are dealing with here. The possibility of farm chemicals being used in this area should add to these consistencies. The nearest road to this area was approximately 250 yards away, so one would not expect this area to be affected by road salts. The pH factor was slightly higher than normal with a very high reading in Sample 2. These readings may be the result of chemicals used on many crops. Resistivity in Samples 1, 2 and 4 show normal resistivity readings and is somewhat consistent, although with a greater range than is usually found in this short distance. Sample 3 shows a very high resistivity, especially within the short distance involved. Minimum resistivities were not consistent with the dry readings, but showed wider varia- tions than are usually found in such a short distance. Chloride readings are higher than normal and the reading in Sample 3 is abnormally high. It is also unusual that these readings vary so much in such a short distance. It should also be noted that chlorides and resistivity are usually inversely proportional. In this case they are not. Other Tests Other tests for Sulfates, Sulfides, Ni- trates and Nitrites show a great variety of values and that in itself is unusual over such a short distance. It should also be noted that live in- sects were found in one sample. While not unusual in itself, it may be signifi- cant that they were only found in one sample. Although the report does not state which sample contained the in- sects, it could be that the insects were killed or fled the area of the circle, or that our sample merely captured these bugs by accident. Conclusion This crop circle does not appear to be a hoax and follows many of the con- sistencies of the crop circles found in England. Many crop circle investiga- tions have focused on the possibility that they were caused by an elec- tromagnetic force. Some state that these are caused in nature through a yet still undiscovered force, perhaps a plasma- vortex. Others feel they are caused by the UFO phenomenon. In either case, a change in the resistivity of the soil could be possible. Another possible cause could be the use of farm chemicals. If this were the case, one would expect the soils to be consistent within the small distances examined. This, and the unlikely probability that a hoax was involved, leads the writer to lean toward the idea that this circle was caused by a still unknown phenomenon. In a related note, it was reported in the Chicago Tribune that two teenage couples (all honor students and one a valedictorian) spotted a strange light two months prior to Ed Lawson's MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 279 July 1991"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"discovery after leaving a movie. This was in New Boston, Illinois about 35 miles to the southwest. \"It was about tree top height and a big geometrical shape, with lights around it : in all colors ... we thought it looked like a street light or a star, then a tower light, then a helicopter hover- ing. We kept getting closer, and it didn't move.\" When they drove to a spot directly beneath it, the object took off. They then \"blew all the stop signs\" trying to keep up. When they speeded up, the ob- ject did. When they slowed, so did it. At one point the object disappeared below the horizon and, just when they thought they lost it, it popped up again. \"It took off again, but when we got to Turkey Hollow Road it disappeared.\" One of the girls' mothers said it had upset the kids so much that they each woke their parents when they got home. Another report in the paper told of a man and his wife who were driving their new car near the farm in late August when the engine started cutting out and shuddering. He said \"it seemed as if a helicopter was trying to land on the car.\" The car was later checked out and nothing wrong was found with it.\" A third report from the area, also reported in the Tribune, is from a former sheriff who said he and a friend had followed a UFO all night. \"It had halo lights and was spinning like a top.\" He says he never reported it because he was still a sheriff then and \"didn't want people to think he was goofy.\" UNUSUAL OBJECT OVER ST. PAUL Richard Bauerlein, Edward Phillips and William McNeff A few years ago Minnesota MUFON sent a letter to all of the county sheriffs in the state offering our assistance in the inves- tigation of UFO reports. As a result, we have received several reports from law officers over the past few years. On the morning of September 11, 1990, Ric- hard Bauerlein, MUFON Section Director for Hennepin, Scott and Carver counties, received a call from the Inver Grove Heights police saying that a woman resident of the city had called them and reported sighting a UFO. The police had Bauerlein's phone number from the letter sent to the coun- ty sheriffs. Bauerlein, whose nickname is Buddy, called the woman and got an initial verbal report over the phone. He reported that she was an articulate and iritelligent-sounding person. Because of a planned trip, Buddy was not able to interview the witness in per- son. William McNeff, MUFON State Director, asked Edward \"Tim\" Phillips, Field Investigator Trainee, to try to in- terview the witness. Because of schedule conflicts, the first opportuni- ty to interview the witness was on September 19, eight days after the sighting. Tim interviewed the witness in her home in the presence of her hus- band. Tim's personal impressdn of the witness was very favorable. The witness filled out a report form, which included a written account. Here is the witness' account, with one interpolation in brackets based on Buddy's original telephone interview with the witness, and a spelling correction: \"September 11, 1990: At 5:15 a.m., I was driving east bound on Mendota Rd./Southview Blvd. and turned left (north bound) to get on Lafayette Freeway. As I looked to see if any cars were coming from behind me on the freeway, I saw this huge thing with red and white lights in the sky. I pulled over on the shoulder and watched it. I knew it was not a plane because it was mov- ing too slow and because it was so low to the ground. I rolled down my win- dow to listen if I could hear anything. I thought that maybe it was a helicopter but I couldn't hear any noise. \"Some of the lights were blinking slowly. The white lights at the bottom of the four legs and the red light on the bottom of the body were not blinking. The lights on the thing were reflecting off the legs and the legs looked a shiny silver. The thing was moving very slow- ly heading east. It did not pass over Lafayette. It was about two blocks west of me when it turned around slowly [on its own axis, practically hovering] and headed back west. \"I thought about going to the next exit and coming back to try to follow it, but I chose to go to work and call some- one about it. I was hoping someone else had reported it also. \"When I got to work at 5:40,1 wasn't sure if I wanted to call anyone about it. I sat in my office thinking about it, and thinking about what to do. I wanted to know if someone else had reported it, so at 6:00 I called the Inver Grove Heights Police. \"I told the police everything that had happened. At 6:30, the police called me back. They told me that they sent some squad cars out in the area after I called, but they didn't see anything. \"Shortly after that Richard Bauerlein called me.\" F irst of all, the witness told Buddy that she times her drive to work so that she virtually always gets there at 5:30 a.m. sharp. Because she got to work 10 minutes late the morn- ing of the llth, she is certain that she parked the car on the shoulder and watched the object for 10 minutes. This supports her statement that the object moved at a very slow speed. Because the witness was in a mov- ing car during the initial part of the sighting, she had an opportunity to in effect \"triangulate\" and thus form some judgement of the object's distance, and therefore its size. She judged that it was about 100 feet on a side and one-to-two blocks away. Figuring 12 city blocks to a mile, a block is 440 feet. Averaging her estimates to get 1.5 blocks or 660 MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 279 July 1991"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"feet away, an object 100 feet across would subtend an angle of 8.6 degrees. In the report form, she compares the size of the object to \"16?\" times the size of the full moon. Since the full moon is 0.52 degrees on average, this estimate is 8.3 degrees. Her two estimates agree within 0.3 degrees! There is probably a bit of luck here, but we appear to have a fairly accurate witness. A calculation of the elevation angle can also be made. The witness estimated the altitude of the craft to be between 300 and 900 feet. If we assume the one-to-two block distance to the ob- ject is to a point on the ground direct- ly under the craft, then the angle of elevation for an object one block away and at 300 feet altitude is 34 degrees and for two blocks and 900 feet, 46 degrees. The average is 40 degrees, i.e. a little less than halfway up in the sky. When first seen, the object was, very approximately, 1/4 of the way up in the sky, or on the order of 20 degrees. Assuming the altitude to be the average of the witness' estimates or about 600 feet, trigonometry gives the distance as about 1500 feet to the object when first seen. It would then have had to move approximately 800 feet in order to be 660 feet away at closest approach. Eight hundred feet in five minutes is about two mph. This seems possibly too slow, given her description; it would probably be hard to see motion this slow of an object in the sky. Because Form 1 forced her to round off the angle, it could easily have been half that or less. An angle of 10 degrees would have meant the object was initially 3400 feet away; it would then have had to move 2700 feet in five minutes, or about six mph. It seems plain that the object was moving so slowly that the witness could have followed it in her car, just as she considered doing. Again the math supports the witness' account. The witness braved the ridicule of her co-workers to ask them if they had seen the object. Initially none of them ad- mitted to seeing anything unusual. One of her co-workers used computer graphics to sketch a color picture of the object based on her description. It must be pointed out that the computer sketch has minor errors on three points: The body and legs were only about 2/3 as thick as shown (the witness sketched the recalled thickness in with pencil lines, which we have almost totally erased); the lights along the sides were red, green and white, not just red and green as shown; and the \"tail\" was about twice as long as her co-worker had drawn it. (We also have the witness' original sketches on the report form, which agree with her verbal description.) We advertized in the Sun News- papers, which covered all or most of the southern suburbs of the Twin Cities, asking if any one else had seen anything on September llth. No additional reports were received from this ad. McNeff called the witness several weeks later to clarify the distance estimates. The witness made a good im- pression on him in that brief phone call. At that time she said that a co-worker had seen something that morning, but that he didn't want to report it. Out of respect for his privacy, we made no at- tempt to contact him. Since no man-made object resembles the appearance and flight characteristics of the reported object, no checks were made about aircraft, etc. Since the witness was able to give a clear and concise description of the ob- ject and its behavior, and since there is excellent internal consistency to this report, and since all three investigators had a very favorable impression of the witness, it is our conclusion that we have an accurate and detailed account of a very unusual object seen early in the morning of September 11,1990, over West St. Paul, Minnesota. INTERVIEW WITH JESSE MARCEL, JR., M.D. Paul Fischer T wo MUFON investigators have contacted Jesse A. Marcel, Jr., M.D., son of Jesse Marcel, the intelligence officer at Roswell Army Air Field, to gain more input on the descrip- tion of the I-beam and the symbols ap- pearing thereon. The debris was shown to both Jesse, Jr., and his mother on their kitchen table the evening that it was collected. Since 43 years have elapsed, Dr. Marcel could only share his memory of the pieces that he handled. Paul Fisher of Glencoe, Illinois con- tacted Dr. Marcel by telephone on Oc- tober 29, 1990 in his home in Helena, Montana. These are the highlights from the call. Question: What color were the symbols? Answer: The symbols on the debris were a violet hue on a gray or dull aluminum color background.

Answer: No. Question: Do you think your father told you everything, or might he have been holding back some information? Answer: It's possible, but I don't think so. I think he told me what he knew.

Quarterly Report — FUFOR The apparent crash of at least one UFO and the recovery of alien bodies outside Roswell, New Mexico, con- tinued to be the major activity of the Fund's Executive Committee during the first quarter of 1991. This activity was conducted in several ways: • Congressional contacts — In January, a group of concerned citizens in the Washington, D.C. area presented a briefing paper and videotape, both en- titled \"Recollections of Roswell,\" to an important congressional committee. The evaluation of the committee's Deputy Chief Counsel was that the case for the crash of an extraterrestrial spacecraft was \"circumstantial, at best.\" However, he indicated a desire to receive any additional information when it is available. An effort is under- way to provide that information; in the meantime, other congressional contacts are in progress. • Follow-up investigation — The Fund awarded a grant of nearly $1,900 to Don Schmitt and Kevin Randle to pay for expenses incurred in interviewing additional witnesses in the Roswell case. One of the witnesses said her family was threatened with death by the Army Air Force if they discussed the event. Other witnesses described loading and transporting crates with what they believed were the remains from the Roswell crash and transporting them to Fort Worth, Texas - the head- quarters for the Eighth Air Force. A summary of the latest witness testimony will be provided to contributors to the Roswell project. • Public Education — A newspaper column was distributed to 3,800 .newspapers across the country in an ef- fort to focus further public attention on the Roswell case. The effort was co- sponsored by Ryan Wood, operator of Stanton Friedman's UFOLine (1-900-446-UFOS), whose support is greatly appreciated. In the meantime, the primary in- vestigators into the case (Schmitt and Randle, co-authors of the forthcoming book, UFO Crash at Roswell, and Stan- ton T. Friedman and Don Berliner, who are also writing a book on the case to be published later this year) have sub- mitted proposals for additional research. During this quarter, the Executive Committee selected two recipients for the 1990 Donald E. Keyhoe Journalism Award, which was established in 1990 in the memory of the former director of the National Investigations Commit- tee on Aerial Phenomena. This year, the committee decided to make awards for both print and broadcast entries. The winner in the print category was Sharon Santus, a staff writer for the Greensburg (PA) Tribune-Review, for her article on the alleged crash of a UFO in Kecksburg, PA. Her December 9, 1990 article on the 25th anniversary of the event, \"Kecksburg UFO Seen at AF Bases,\" was considered the best en- try in the print category because \"it was an excellent example of investigative reporting,\" according to the judges in the awards competition. The winner in the broadcast division was George Knapp, reporter for KLAS- TV, Las Vegas, NV, for his multi-part series entitled \"UFOs: The Best Evidence?,\" which was broadcast in May 1990. Knapp's series was a follow- up to the documentary he produced in 1989, which was the winner of that year's Keyhoe Journalism Award. San- tus and Knapp each received a $1,000 cash award from the Fund. Two entries also received Honorable Mention by the panel of judges: \"The Gulf Breeze Debate\" by Vicki Cooper, a series of articles in UFO magazine, which is published in Los Angeles, CA: and \"Unidentified Flying Objects\" by John T. Witt, Assistant State Editor of the Richmond (VA) Times-Dispatch, on the more than 100 UFO sighting reports around the Chesapeake Bay in Virginia. The purpose of the annual awards competition is to encourage and recognize quality journalism and serious investigative reporting on the subject of Unidentified Flying Objects, without regard to any particular hypothesis. We are pleased to report that UFO Crash at Roswell by Kevin Randle and Don Schmitt is now available from the Fund for $4.95 plus 50 cents postage. This affordable paperback book will provide a new breakthrough in our understanding of what happened in New Mexico in July 1947. Thanks to your support, the Fund has provided nearly $45,000 for the follow- up investigation into the Roswell case, which has resulted in the identification of additional witnesses and evidence. However, the effort is continuing, and additional costs are being incurred. If we are to provide more financial sup- port for this highly significant project, we will need at least $10,000 in addi- tional funds. Therefore, we are asking you to make a generous donation to support the Roswell case research. Contributors will receive regular up- dates on the progress of the investigation.

The Implant Puzzle Since writing \"The Implant Enigma\" about 16 months ago, I have received some interesting responses. Two or three individuals were quite upset because my speculative article was printed in the Mufon UFO Journal. The article had exactly the opposite effect on others. Many were happy to develop a dialog on the subject and to seek some real answers to the puzzle. One man, with X-rays of his nasal passage in hand, thought he had proof of an im- plant. A bit of investigation showed that the implant was nothing more than a 'marker' placed there by the technician during the X-ray process. Another man MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 279 July 1991"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"sent me copies of the laboratory analysis results of testing on what he thought might be an implant. The jury is still out on this one - the results are quite puzzling. Stuart Appelle, Ph.D. of Brockport, NY sent the following letter to the Editor of the Mufon UFO Journal for publication in the January 1991 issue: \"Dear Editor: In his article, \"The Im- plant Enigma' (June 1990), John Schuessler suggests that a structure reportedly found in amniotic fluid dur- ing a routine chromosome preparation (Nature, Vol. 323, Sept. 25, 1986, pg. 300) might be an alien implant. In relating this unidentified fetal object to unidentified flying objects, Schuessler implores researchers to 'take the im- plant issue seriously.' A number of readers did just that (see Letters to the Editor section, August 1990). Two con- tributors comment on the fact that in subsequent issues of Nature, a mundane explanation of the structure was pro- vided, and Schuessler is taken to task for \"sloppy articles and sloppier research.\" It is correct to point out the in- complete and misleading aspects of my article. Indeed, my entreatment to \"look at the possibilities\" so as to avoid \"wild speculation\" invites such a response. In the same spirit, it should be noted that the information provided in these Letters to the Editor is also in- complete and misleading. While both letters correctly reference cor- respondence published in the October 23 and October 30, 1986 issues of Nature, in which the mystery object was interpreted as a diatom skeleton, it is misleading to state that the object has been \"identified\" as such. The diatom explanation was an expression of opi- nion, not a presentation of proof. Moreover, the December 25, 1986 issue of Nature provides two other \"ex- planations\" (a \"fragment of tubular myelin\"; an \"area of meshwork of the nuclear lamina\") and yet another ex- planation (a contaminant originating in the fabrication of semiconductors) ap- pears in the January 22, 1987 issue. In that same issue, J. Wolstenholme, who originally reported this \"mystery object amid the chromosomes,\" indi- cates that all these explanations describe objects too irregular to match the one in question. He also rejects an extraterrestrial explanation which, in- terestingly, he indicates accounted for the majority of the explanations sent by readers to him. To find out if this search for explana- tions has been solved more satisfactori- ly since 1987, I wrote to Dr. Wolsten- holme and received a gracious reply. As of July 26, 1990, he still did not have an explanation he regards as convinc- ing, but continues to believe the object is likely to be an artifact originating in either the laboratory environment, the reagents used in preparation, or the laboratory equipment. He reports that \"the object has been sent for more detailed analysis elsewhere,\" and he assures that he will let researchers know if and when the object is positively identified. Missing the Point While Dr. Wolstenholme's artifact is interesting, it probably is not related to implants in humans by aliens. I said as much in \"The Implant Enigma, Part n,\" written weeks before \"The Implant Enigma\" was published in the Mufon UFO Journal. The following is a quote from Part II: \"The object was many times smaller than the alleged UFO implants; but this tiny object has been spotted in the laboratory. My point was that scientists find and identify strange anomalies on a continuing basis. Why not apply the same techniques to locating and iden- tifying UFO artifacts located anywhere in the human body?\" While some individuals are content to spend their time challenging the words written by the active researchers, many other individuals find their challenges by working with the pa- tient/abductees and their implants. Some good examples of the latter category are David Pritchard, David Jacobs, John Altshuler and Budd Hopkins. These 'doers' are the people who will eventually provide some real answers for the implant puzzle. A number of inquiries resulting from \"The Implant Enigma\" have been in the form of \"unusual questions.\" They are offered in the form they were received in order to see if they evoke a response from anyone. • What causes the scoop marks found on abductees' bodies? Was the flesh used elsewhere on the body to repair areas where implants were inserted? • Has anyone tried having a psychic surgeon remove an implant? • Originally, it was believed that im- plants were spherical BB-like objects. In reality, many of the alleged implants have been irregular shaped objects. Have any BB-like implants been found? • What is the purpose of the small wire-like protrusions found on recovered implants? — John Schuessler Dis-Communion ? Whitley Strieber was on ABC-TV the morning of Thursday, July 11, looking as relaxed as I've ever seen him and saying that UFO abductions are essen- tially due to anxiety and stress, perhaps induced as early as childhood. The next day I received the latest issue of The Communion Letter, accompanied by a cover letter from Mr. Strieber announ- cing the quarterly's cessation after two years of publication. The reasons for its demise? \"I am not a UFO researcher,\" Mr. Strieber writes, \"and do not wish to endure the con- tinued media attack that is associated with being involved in this field. In ad- dition, the so-called 'UFO-ologists' are probably the cruellest, nastiest and craziest people I have ever encountered. Their interpretation of the visitor ex- perience is rubbish from beginning to end. The 'abduction reports' they generate are not real. They are artifacts of hypnosis and cultural conditioning.\" We assume Mr. Strieber had a choice of going graciously into the UFO night or angrily. Obviously he has opted for the latter. His remarks about the media are nonetheless somewhat interesting. By his own admission, he made up- wards of 250 media appearances in the course of publicizing the bestselling Communion alone. If same were nothing but relentless attacks, one MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 279 July 1991"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"might be forgiven for thinking that he might have been a bit battered and bruised by, say, media appearance one or two hundred and withdrawn from the spotlight accordingly. But he did not. He went on to write Transformation and Majestic and to suffer through countless additional media appearances, or at- tacks, as he has it. Anyone who ever saw Mr. Strieber on \"Larry King Live,\" however, would have thought that he was being handled with kid gloves rather than the usual character assassination tool kit the media is well known to wield. For that matter, what about Mr. Strieber's ABC appearance? Did network moguls, sensing this was their last chance for a parting backstab, implore one last appearance? How and why was it so arranged? Could it have been at Mr. Strieber's request? But no: there are no honorable humans in the media, apparently, no sympathetic ears or hearts, just as, col- lectively, there are no ufologists, sane, sensible or otherwise, but only the cruellest, nastiest and craziest citizens of the planet Earth Mr. Strieber has ever had the personal misfortune to en- counter. If memory serves, a similar falling in and out of friendship occur- red earlier between Mr. Strieber and the science-fiction community. No doubt they were all jealous of his success, too. Certainly Mr. Strieber himself is never to blame for his misfortunes and misunderstandings, only others. One wonders what circles Mr. Strieber keeps, and why he keeps land- ing himself in the same pond. Is there a worldwide conspiracy afoot, or is he merely the victim of a martyr complex? Is there something about the UFO sub- ject itself that turns otherwise curious people, ipso facto, into raving Blue Meanies, hellbent on destroying lives and careers. In his concluding \"Farewell\" for The Communion Letter, Mr. Strieber writes that \"unless one thinks indeterminate- ly about the visitors, one cannot think about them usefully and correctly.\" By indeterminately, he seems to suggest something akin to the contradictions found in current quantum mechanics, which treats a photon, for example, as simultaneously a wave and particle. One wonders why Mr. Strieber himself can't apply his own hard- learned lessons, why he can't think in- determinately of the media and ufology as composed of individuals rather than as monolithic structures, the members of which all mindlessly adhere to the footsteps and thinking of a few promi- nent visible leaders. Instead, we read that \"The press and the UFO communi- ty stand together against further pro- gress in the field. Until organizations like MUFON and CUFOS disintegrate or become discredited, and the press is allowed to discover that there are peo- ple with strong and respected creden- tials working on the subject, further progress is unlikely.\" Those two organizations, who find themselves frequently at odds with prevailing media attitudes, as well as with each other, will no doubt be sur- prised to learn that they are now link- ed in league with same. In this context, at least, we share similar wounds with Mr. Strieber, who keeps his salt to himself. And in the end he doth, methinks, protest too much. Newton, at least, had the graciousness to say that if he saw so far, it was because he stood on the shoulders of his predecessors. Certain members of the Communion club are so intellectually arrogant, however, as to believe, like Columbus, that they discovered America. And I speak from personal experience, which I will not go into here. Finally, there is the matter of what this all meant. I personally thought that The Commuion Letter was one of the more well-produced newsletters in the business. If it had a different point of view from \"orthodox\" ufology, so much the better. If it served as a legitimate critic of some of our prac- tices and conclusions, again, so much the better. If it offered \"abductees\" an alternative approach, so much the bet- ter, too. Instead, the proprietor has thrown in the towel, churlishly and seemingly in childish spite, sprinkled with scattered parting shots. For fellow travellers and scientists whom he would seemingly want to win over to his side, what kind of example is this? Either it takes in- testinal fortitude to stand up to the \"world,\" or it doesn't. Moreover, what is to become of the Communion club as a whole? Having cast their die with same, are its members now to be reconsigned to or- thodox ufology, \"the cruellest, nastiest and craziest people\" its organizer has ever encountered? In terms of commitment and thanks for past support, it strikes this observer at least as a strange fare-thee-well. Speaking indeterminately of course. -D.S.

Johnson MUFON Continental Coordinator for Central America \"Timothy Good now believes that governments are realizing they will not be able to maintain the cover-up much longer ...\" so the dust-jacket flap on Alien Liaison - The Ultimate Secret states; perhaps indicating to us why this new book from Britain gives the impres- sion of having been written and publish- ed with some haste. Or perhaps it was the concern of the publisher that the book could be held up by some sort of legal injunction, as was Peter Wright's Spycatcher recently, for openly discuss- ing too many UFO \"official secrets\" too soon (the injunction threat, real or im- agined, was on author Good's mind in letters he wrote as late as March 1991). In any case, for whatever reason, we have a new volume from Timothy Good that is likely to disappoint many readers of his previous Above Top Secret (Sidgwick & Jackson Ltd., London, 1987), as it lacks both the historical depth and worldwide scope of the previous work, tending to concentrate heavily on the American flying saucer scene and its many lurid rumors of re- cent years. Here are all the tales of alien malevolence and human reproductive tampering; disappearing planes and pilots; the Robert Lazar story of cap- tured (or bartered) alien disk craft and \"element 115 reactors\"; the equally col- orful career of Robert Lazar himself; animal mutilations and unmarked/black helicopters; paranormal happenings and haunted ranches in Colorado; the five- year-old Roswell saucer crash wit- ness; the Kecksburg, Pennsylvania and other crash/retrievals; contactees, both named and anonymous (p. 61, 66); the \"MAJESTIC TWELVE\" group and involvement by U.S. Presidents Truman, Eisenhower, Carter, Nixon and even Jackie Gleason (p. 93), with crashed disks and alien corpses. No stone or tabloid page is left unturned as Good draws upon such sources as John Lear, Paul Bennewitz, Richard C. Doty and the other \"birds\" of William Moore's flock, through extensive references to the writings (and more recently, televi- sion documentaries) of Robert Emeneg- ger, Linda Howe, George Knapp, William Steinman, Leonard Stringfield, Wendelle Stevens, and even Timothy Good's previous Above Top Secret which is cited often in the notes. That much of this retold \"informa- tion\" is suspected by American research- ers of being disinformation is hardly mentioned, and Mr. Good's largely British and southern-hemisphere English speaking readership are left to sort it out for themselves, aided by such guidelines as \"In order to be effective, disinformation should contain some elements of truth\" (p. 39), and \"The aliens themselves are not adverse to spreading disinformation\" (p. 77). Lit- tle in the way of original investigation by the author in order to establish what is \"the truth\" is in evidence, despite references to numerous trips to the USA. It seems that Good prefers to re- ly extensively on informants, cor- respondents and previously published reports, without adequate primary- source checks to establish the veracity of what is being reported. Some of these sources of historical accounts are dead, of course, but much of the material in the book is contemporary and can be checked. Perhaps the intent was not to check too closely; why ruin a good story by investigating the peo- ple mentioned in it or the storyteller and discovering that it is probably false? Better perhaps to just repeat the claims made in documentaries, newsletters and the everpresent \"personal cor- respondence with the author,\" in order that the readers experience the full gale of current flying saucer winds blowing around North America, unbroken by any analysis or active investigation. But we discover that the flying saucer breezes are made more turbulent by the \"who you gonna believe?\" factor, as some of Timothy Good's informants ap- pear to change their stories over time, and others \"have proved to be completely unreliable,\" as Good ironically says about John Lear's sources (p. 19). For exam- ple, quoting Robert Emenegger and Alan Sandier, Good cannot decide whether an alleged UFO landing at Holloman AFB, NM occurred in April 1964 or May 1971 (p. 102). The following page has Good relating the same story from no less a source than Richard C. Doty (via Linda M. Howe's 1989 book, An Alien Harvest), who includes the touching, homey part about the Socorro, NM lan- ding witnessed by policeman Lonnie Zamora being a mistake of some sort. Apparently the UFOnauts got the coor- dinates wrong and missed Holloman AFB by 90 miles and half a day (or seven years and a month, depending on which Emenegger account we accept; Good provides both). But what of the April 26, 1964 land- ing at La Madera, NM with all its similarities to the Socorro case two days previous?* Are we to buy that they \"got the coordinates wrong\" twice, or that they had to search around for Holloman for seven years? Is this supposed to be the same extraterrestrial intelligence that walks through walls and has been \"adjusting\" human genetics for 25,000 years (p. 106)? Something about all this just doesn't add up, and one begins to believe that some (or all) of Timothy Good's sources are having a little fun at the expense of the truth. T his becomes even more apparent in the final chapter of Alien Liai- son, where we expect Good to reveal either some conclusive proof of * NICAP files MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 279 July 1991"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"government-alien \"liaisons\" or some of the personal contacts with the phenomenon he has only hinted at in several interviews. Instead we are treated to an uncritical and unquestion- ing account of the odyssey of Robert L. Oechsler, Maryland's frequently heard radio UFO-personality, which begins with a conversation with an Admiral. Bob Oechsler has doggedly pursued retired Admiral Bobby Ray Inman, former director of the National Security Agency, for some years now hoping to get the Admiral to reveal an association with the \"MAJESTIC TWELVE\" group. To this writer's knowledge, Ad- miral Inman has not in any manner ever been connected with the flying saucer controversy except in this assumption asserted by Bob Oechsler. Good begins his concluding chapter by contrasting the careers of Inman and Oechsler, and then offers us a \"revealing\" transcript of a telephone call that Bob Oechsler made to the retired Admiral at Timothy Good's urging. In this conversation, it is somewhat obvious that Inman is not at all sure of what Oechsler is referring to with his convoluted questions about \"cultural dialog,\" \"indoctrination pro- gramme,\" \"EMP,\" \"crafts\" and \"vehicles,\" and that the Admiral mostly wants to just get this guy off his phone by inviting him to try some other retir- ing intelligence service heads some- where else with his inquiry. Curiously, there are no specific references in this whole transcript either to flying saucers, UFOs, MJ-12 or anything of the sort, yet much emphasis is placed on the implied significance of this exchange: \" 'Do you anticipate that any of the recovered vehicles would ever become available for technological research? Outside of the military circles?' Bob asked. 'Again, I honestly don't know,' replied Admiral Inman. 'Ten years ago the answer would have been no. Whether as time has evolved they are beginning to become more open on it, there's a possibility ...' \" (p. 191). Well, is this flying saucer Glasnost at last ... an MJ-12 member tearing down the walls of secrecy and reveal- ing all to Bob Oechsler? We were in- terested in what really passed in this conversation and what the Admiral might have to say on the subject of saucers. Bobby Ray Inman graduated from the same University of Texas as did this writer, and after a life of public service at posts all around the world he returned home to Austin, Texas where he has been variously a director, president, chief executive of- ficer, or chairman of the board of a number of microelectronics, com- munications, computer, chemical, or other high-technology businesses in his \"retirement.\" We called Admiral Inman on the phone, and he was cor- dial and forthcoming in his answers to our specific and unambiguous questions: We asked Admiral Inman if he re- called conversations with Bob Oechsler representing Timothy Good and Lord Hill-Norton: (Inman) \"Mr. Oechsler made contact with Tom King of my office, and talked to me one time by phone.\" We asked if he had suggested the names of Everett Hineman (CIA) and Rear Admiral Sumner Shapiro (Naval Intelligence, Ret.) for Oechsler to contact: (Inman) \"Yes, I did, but Oechsler misrepresented himself as approaching those gentlemen at my urging, which was not the case ... I only provided names for him to contact.\" We asked if the quote from Timothy Good's book about \"recovered vehicles\" was familiar to him and essentially correct: (Inman) \"What kind of vehicles is he talking about?\" We replied that the whole book was concerned with flying saucers: (Inman) \"That's totally out of con- text. The conversation I recall ... the reference was to underwater vehicles.\" Finally, we asked the Admiral if he had any observations on the subject matter of Timothy Good's book: (Inman) \"Of course I haven't seen the book, (but) on this matter of alien vehicles; I have never encountered any information on the subject that turned out to be factual.\" (From notes made during a telephone interview with the reviewer, May 29, 1991.) B ob Oechsler next pursued CIA Deputy Director for Science and Technology Everett Hineman to his Langley, VA office, but apparently could not get even an ambiguous state- ment to quote out of context from him: \" The bottom line, from the forty-five minutes I spent with him, was that he tried to conclusively give me the im- pression that he didn't know anything about flying saucers,' Bob said. 'But he indicated that either he or someone else would get back to me within the next week.' \" (p. 193) Oechsler seemed to have better luck with retired Director of Naval In- telligence Rear Admiral Sumner Shapiro, who is reported to have discussed the intricacies of the \"in- terlocking components of the craft\" (spacecraft? watercraft? arts and crafts?), yet there are no direct quotes from Mr. Shapiro; only Bob Oechsler's generalizations of what was discussed in their meetings (p. 194-5). We telephoned Sumner Shapiro to get his recollections (something Timothy Good, or his editor, or his publisher could have done but did not; Shapiro didn't know he was featured in a book): We asked Shapiro to comment on the passage from Timothy Good's book: \"Shapiro seemed to Bob not only to suggest that the United States was in possession of extraterrestrial space vehicles, but also to give every indica- tion of having studied one at close quarters.\" (Shapiro) \"That's absolutely false. I gave him no reason to believe I had any knowledge of what he was talking about.\" We asked him to comment on another passage: \"He told me how they would take them apart, pack them up and ship them around in trucks to different laboratories. He never told me specifically where things were taken: he was very careful about obvious breaches of security of classified infor- mation.\" (Shapiro) \"No, that has no basis in fact ... I thought the guy was a nut, I didn't want him in my home any longer than necessary. He started off beating around the bush. I had to ask him 'What is the subject? What are we talk- MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 279 July 1991"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"ing about?' ... and Oechsler pulled out of his bag a triangular plastic thing with what looked like a shrunken head in it, a triangular head like some kind of spaceman ... wasn't long before I asked him to leave.\" (From notes made dur- ing a telephone interview with this reviewer, June 8, 1991.) Timothy Good reported that Bob Oechsler's meeting with Sumner Shapiro in the retired admiral's Virginia home \"concluded rather abruptly\" (p. 195). The rebuttal, no doubt, will be \"you believe them!\" But the real question should be, \"Can we believe Bob Oechsler?\" Timothy Good introduces us to Bob Oechsler as an engineer and refers repeatedly (at least five times) to his past association with NASA, work- ing in some capacity not disclosed on the International Ultraviolet Explorer and the Apollo-Soyuz Test projects dur- ing the mid-1970s at Goddard Spaceflight Center (p. 189). Before long, Bob becomes \"a NASA mission specialist and project engineer\" (p. 197, also photo caption opposite p. 115). Of course, we phoned the God- dard Spaceflight Center in Greenbelt, MD and spoke twice to Ms. Randy Ex- ler in the Public Affairs Office. While not recognizing Bob Oechsler and not knowing of his radio (and satellite distributed cable television) broadcasts, she was very interested in his using the NASA-Goddard affiliation and pro- mised to \"check on it.\" She provided the following information in our second conversation: \"I checked with Personnel Manage- ment Branch and our records only go back ten years. Robert L. Oechsler is not known in the current records. He could have worked here for a contrac- tor, in which case we would not have record of him in any case. The title 'mission specialist' is not something that is used around here; that's a title that NASA gives to an astronaut!\" O ur confidence in Timothy Good's source thus bolstered, we embark on the climax of his book, Bob Oechsler's strange and wonderful odyssey (often by unmark- ed, quiet helicopter) into some of the most secret and impenetrable places the government has for storing, studying and using \"alien technology,\" the Cosmic Journey Project. All the locked doors open to Mr. Oechsler, who mere- ly has to flash his identification as \"mission specialist\" for Ringling Bros, and Barnum & Bailey ... that's right... Circus! With some misgivings about Good's journalistic judgment, we read on about how Bob Oechsler ran away and joined the Ringling Bros, and Barnum & Bailey International Organization and, as Bob tells it, from early November 1989 through late January 1990, worked for them in getting actual captured alien spacecraft and an \"alien/ET corpse in a cryogenic tank\" (p. 199) for use in a proposed travelling public exhibition. Timothy Good reports that Bob Oechsler arranged this himself with an unnamed General of an unspecified service branch somewhere in the bowels of the Pentagon Building. After shaking hands on the genuine saucer and frozen alien deal, Oechsler's con- sultantship with Ringling et al qualified him to \"tag along for the ride\" inside the dreaded black helicopters as they made their rounds to such wonderous places as: (1) An \"antigravity chamber\" in a building with no roads leading to it \"about 20 miles southwest of Ellington AFB\" (Houston, Texas). Inside, \"engi- neer\" Oechsler got to float around with astronauts and scientists, and he was asked to personally redesign the space shuttle's remote manipulator arm dur- ing his visit! (p. 203, it's in the book!) (2) A secret \"bunker\" north of Houston housing an alien control panel, which \"engineer\" Oechsler had to study and understand (p. 204). (3) An offshore platform in the Gulf of Mexico where NORAD maintains a huge, secret \"control room\" with \"an enormous screen that was many times the size of a normal cinema screen\" (p. 205). Bob had fortuitously tagged along and dropped in just as the radar displays indicated an invasion of five alien spacecraft over the southern United States! \"Engineer\" Oechsler was not, however, asked to take command of the situation in defense of our planet against the onslaught. In his own words: \"Everyone was quite busy. I was essen- tially there along for the ride.\" (p. 206) (4) An encounter with an apparent \"alien\" in a Dallas, Texas cocktail lounge, which included the psychic equivalent of a barroom brawl between Oechsler and the cat-eyed entity; with Bob seeming to be getting the worst of it until his lady friend (at last a name: Melanie King) intervened and chased the alien away! (This is in the book, really ... p. 200-1.) We are relieved to learn that Bob Oechsler suffered no permanent psychic injuries as a result of this altercation. Despite the fantasy / dream-like nature of the aforegoing we did check and found out that there really was a project \"Cosmic Journey\" intended to be a travelling exhibit of space travel history and extraterrestrial contact possibilities, including information on UFO sightings and abduction reports. But a rather different picture of Bob Oechsler's role emerged when we talk- ed with Mr. Robert W. Kirchgessner, Director, Special Development Group, Ringling Bros, and Barnum & Bailey International, Inc.: We asked Mr. Robert Kirchgessner (RK) if Bob Oechsler was employed in the Cosmic Journey Project: (RK) \"Not really. He was called down one time to discuss the alien aspect of it. I met with him one time in Orlando and we felt that his contribu- tion to the project wasn't what we were looking for.\" We asked about Oechsler's claims of being sent to Houston to work in an \"antigravity chamber\" and redesign the remote manipulator arm for a display space shuttle: (RK) \"Not on our behalf. We built a replica shuttle which is currently on display at the Kennedy Space Center that does have a Canadian ... remote manipulator arm in it, but ... all the work that was done on it was done in Apopka, Florida. To my knowledge he had nothing whatsoever to do with that.\" We asked if the Project had sent Oechsler on any journey to Ellington AFB: (RK) \"No, to my knowledge they did MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 279 July 1991"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"not... I was project director on the pro- ject ... The only involvement I had with Mr. Oechsler was a single meeting in Orlando, Florida that lasted one after- noon. Other than that we did not use him for any consultation or involvement in the project ...\" We asked about Oechsler's claimed meeting with a \"general\" in the Pen- tagon to discuss including real flying saucers and alien bodies in their displays: (RK) \"No .. to my knowledge, the only thing that Oechsler did with Timothy Good's recommendation was I called him down, and I was sitting in a restaurant here with him in Orlando, Florida; and he proceeds to tell me that there was a CIA agent behind us watching him, and I just felt that I didn't need any part of this type of action whatsoever, especially when our par- ticular project was an entertainment type project.\" We asked if there was any participa- tion by intelligence agencies or the military in the Cosmic Journey Project? (RK) \"No ... none whatsoever ... we had a board of advisors; we had Cap- tain Gene Cernan, we had Peter Con- rad (Astronauts) ... working with us very closely .. the NASA organization through Jim Funkhauser's office up there, and through local NASA officials here. The 'alien' expert that we had used for consultation in developing the show was Mr. (Jun-Ichi) Yaoi, who worked for ... NHK (Television Net- work) in Japan ... one of the foremost authorities on alien encounters ... But in the type of issues you are talking about, No; and the only thing that I did at Timothy's recommendation was, like I said, I called him (Oechsler) down and paid for his expenses and asked him to come to Orlando to talk to me about what he knew about this stuff, and in our conversation he offered that he could get hold of an alien space ship, and that he had CIA agents watching him, and I backed off! ... To my knowledge, nothing else was ever done with him.\" (From a telephone conversation with this reviewer on May 28, 1991, edited for length.) Timothy Good, his editor or his pub- lisher could have made the same in- quiries that we did and perhaps the last chapter of Alien Liaison would have been written somewhat differently. As it stands, we fear it is the kiss of death for what would otherwise still be only a muddled, uncritical collection of rumors and assumptions derived from less-than-always-reliable sources (we're being generous here). As Rear Admiral (Ret.) Sumner Shapiro put it to us in our interview, which we were given specific permission to quote: \"Mr. Good's credibility will suffer from using this in his book.\" We couldn't agree more. For a subject such as this one, short of offering any \"absolute proof,\" an author must gain the confidence of the reader by examining the available evidence and weeding-out that which does not stand up to certain critical tests. Timothy Good seems to take the \"where there's smoke there must be fire\" approach in Alien Liaisons, dump- ing rumor and hearsay together with some little documentation to build his case. Unfortunately, there are a lot of people \"blowing smoke\" in the flying saucer world, and the inclusion of any and everything does not inspire a high level of confidence in the thesis Mr. Good is trying to convey. In Others' Words ... Lucius Parish The June 11 issue of NATIONAL ENQUIRER featured an article based on Howard Blum's controversial book, OUT THERE. Very little UFO mater- ial makes it into the ENQUIRER these days; if only we could say the same for the other weekly tabloids! The 1989-90 UFO sightings over Belgium are the subject of the \"An- timatter/UFO Update\" column in the July issue of OMNI. Investigations of the Belgian events have been notable for the cooperation between the military and civilian UFO research groups. Raymond Fowler's third book on the Andreasson (Luca) case, THE WATCHERS, will soon be available in a paperback edition from Bantam Books. Autographed copies of the paperback are available directly from Fowler for $8.50 each or $21.00 for the hardcover edition (postpaid). The address is: 13 Friend Court - Wenham, MA 01984. You might also want to check with Fowler concerning copies of his other books, some of which are getting very difficult to find. UFO CRASH AT ROSWELL by Kevin D. Randle & Donald R. Schmitt is now available (Avon Books: $4.95). While there are elements of the Roswell case which are not discussed in this book, it does represent a signifi- cant amount of research into the events which took place in New Mexico dur- ing the summer of 1947. For that reason, it is well worth adding to your UFO library. If you're at all interested in the sub- ject of \"ancient astronauts,\" you will undoubtedly want to obtain a copy of the latest book by David Hatcher Childress, VIM AN A AIRCRAFT OF ANCIENT INDIA & ATLANTIS. Childress has reprinted various ancient writings which detail various types of flying machines supposedly used by these civilizations. The book is well il- lustrated with drawings and photos relating to the subject matter. This large softcover volume (333 pages) is available from Adventures Unlimited Press - P.O.

People seldom took us seriously. They giggled. But I don't care any more. I'm talking.\" DeYoung had a close encounter with a UFO. The setting was Mountain Home Air Force Base near Boise, Idaho, on a quiet, crystal clear summer night, shortly after sunset. \"I was part of a contingent of about 120 persons, mostly department heads in the Air Force, assigned to reactivate Mountain Home. It was to become a departure base for Armed Forces personnel going to Korea. That night about half of our group was away. But that left sixty.\" DeYoung was in the barracks, resting on a bunk bed and reading a book. \"Suddenly, one of the guys came run- ning into the barracks. He was yelling something about 'a UFO above the run- way.' I told him, 'That's just great. Go have a ball.' Of course I thought it was a joke. In those days I was a 100 per- cent non-believer when it came to UFOs. So I stayed in my bed with my book. But then I heard them cranking up an old C-45 (an eight-passenger air- craft). Most of us thought it was un- safe to fly. But it was the only plane on the base. So I figured something must be up. That got me outside. Apparent- ly I was the last guy to arrive on the scene. Everybody was there, gawking at a disc-like craft hovering 400 to 500 feet above the runway. It must have been 20 to 25 feet in diameter. We had never seen anything like it before. \"I tell you it was mind-boggling. I've never been the same guy since then. We just waited there, expecting that it would land. We were mesmerized. Eventually, it got close enough for us to see portholes. Something was inside. But just what, I can't say. Maybe it was creatures. Maybe it was the backs of chairs.\" DeYoung said enough of the men had the presence of mind to get the C-45 aloft so they could get a closer look. \"It must have taken a half-hour to get that crate airborne. For awhile, we didn't think it would make it. It stall- ed near the end of the runway and had to start all over again. But finally, up it went. It circled around and moved in on the object from above. But the disc took off. It shot straight up, silently, into the atmosphere at a fantastic speed. We looked at it in awe, until it was just the size of a pinhead. Later I learned that our radio operator tried to make con- tact with it. \"Those of us there that night were quickly reassigned, all over creation. We had been living together in the same one or two barracks. But we got as- signed to many different barracks, then to other bases. I ended up in New Mex- ico. It was as if some higher-ups didn't want us talking to each other about what happened. It seemed strange that some investigators didn't come in to question us. I know a colonel was in charge of the base. He almost had a nervous breakdown that night. The colonel was an older man then, with grey hair. But maybe he's still alive. I'd like to talk to him.\" (Dispatch, St. Paul, MN, 1/11/79) 1956 • In early July, Pat Michaels, news chief of KWIZ, Santa Ana, California, was one of several to go on a Navy sponsored junket to Honolulu. He and the other newsmen were briefed with Naval Air Reserve Squadron VP771, at Los Alamitos Naval Air Sta- tion, California. What Michaels heard made news. His account for the Orange County News Service was dispatched upon his return in mid-July. \"The United States Navy will not publicly ad- mit that it believes in flying discs,\" he wrote, \"but it has officially ordered combat-ready pilots to 'shoot-to-kill' if UFOs are encountered ... the informa- tion was first learned when Navy pilots navigating trans-Pacific routes from the United States to Hawaii were ordered in a briefing session to engage and iden- tify 'any unidentified flying objects.' If the UFOs appeared hostile, the brief- ing officer told pilots of Los Alamitos Naval Station Reserve Squadron VP771, they are to be engaged in combat. \"In Honolulu, members of the squadron talked over the unique orders. It was found that the orders are not unusual. They are a standard command issued to pilots on the trans-Pacific hop.\" Michaels continued: \"Although the Air Force has publicly stated it does not believe in the existence of UFOs, extensive operational procedures, in- cluding forms of combat have been devised by various air defense, com- mands.\" He added that \"operational procedures for a UFO scramble ap- parently are highly classified. Most of- ficers refused to discuss the Pentagon's plans or modes of UFO combat. How- ever, it was learned that a concrete plan of action does exist, covering all types of UFO sightings. The plans reported- ly can be swung into action within seconds.\" How did Navy pilots react to the reported \"orders?\" \"How do we know our bullets will work on a UFO?\" one pilot was quoted as asking the Orange County News Service correspondent. \"And if we do shoot,\" the Navy pilot continued, \"that's asking them to shoot back. And we don't know what they're to shoot at us!\" (Flying Saucers by Max Miller) • An Air Force two-engine transport plane made an emergency landing at Bakersfield, California on the 22nd, after the pilot reported a collision with an unknown object about 11 a.m. The crippled plane, a C-131D, landed at Kern County Airport, its left horizon- tal stabilizer and elevator badly dam- MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 279 July 1991"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"aged. (The Associated Press monitored the pilot's emergency radio call to the airport, and thereby scooped the field as far as the story went. Had it not been for this unintentional \"leak\" it is unlike- ly that the public would have ever heard of the incident.) \"It looked like something struck from above,\" an Air Force spokesman said. The pilot, Ma- jor Merwin Stenvers, said the plane was near Pixley when the collision occur- red. \"It was as if we struck a brick wall,\" the officer'said. The plane, flying at 16,000 feet, went into a vertical dive after it was struck. Stenvers said that he, his copilot, and two crewmen all blacked out during the dive. He said when he came to, the plane was going almost straight up. He estimated it must have dropped' 9000 feet. Major Fred Mclntosh, public in- formation officer at Edwards Air Force Base did not anticipate finding that the accident was caused \"by little green men flying around in saucers.\" But what about UFOs? They were seen in the area before the plane was hit. At 5:15 a.m., two oil drillers, working in Kern County, spotted a flight of six \"disc-shaped objects flying in forma- tion.\" A Richfield Oil truck driver also witnessed the six craft. At 5:30 a.m., UFOs were seen near Pixley, Fresno, Bakersfield, and Piedra. The Opera- tions Center at Edwards Air Force Base, southeast of Bakersfield, also received several UFO reports that morning. Fifteen minutes later, at 5:45 a:m., two additional incidents, which could be related to the Kern County sightings, occurred over Placer County, east of Sacramento. Lauren Bryan and Richard Marty, of the Mosquito Ridge area, saw \"a torpedo-shaped object from which little balls of fire were launched from the rear\" for about a minute. About the same time the Foresthill Ground Observer Corps post reported \"five small objects that looked like balls of fire streak across the sky.\" (SAUCERS magazine, June 1956; OR- BIT newsletter, September 1956; The Times, Los Angeles, CA, 7/23/56; The Califomian, Bakersfield, CA, 7/23/56, plus numerous other newspaper clippings) 1966 • Douglas Tibbets, 18, Mrs. Anita Haifley, 22, and Betty Jean Klem, / ; 16, were parked in a car in the Presque Isle State Park, a peninsula adjacent to Erie, Pennsylvania, on*: Lake Erie, at 9:30 p.m. on the 31st, when a strange craft appeared in the sky from the north and landed abut 300 yards from the car. \"It was metallic, sort of silvery,\" Klem said. \"It landed between two trees. It came straight down. The car vibrated. It was mushroom-shaped with a narrow base rising up to an oval Structure.\" The teenager said that as she and her boyfriend watched from the front seat of his car a beam of light came out of the craft and moved along the ground in a straight line. • \"It lit up the whole woods along its path. It wasn't like a search light. There was light along the ground, along its whole path:\" She said the light did not waver back and forth like a search light, but continued to ex- tend its beam into the woods. Shortly after the light went into the woods, Klem said a police car pulled up near their vehicle. She said as it did so, the beam of light from the craft went out. As her boyfriend and an officer were walking toward the landing site, the horn sounded in the boyfriend's car arid they ran back. The girl said there was a \"thing right by the car.\" It was about six feet tall. It appeared to have the general shape of an upright large creature such as a gorilla, but hot like any animal she had ever seen. Patrolman Paul Wilson and J. Robert Canfield discovered two triangular im- pressions in the sand some dozen feet apart in the landing area. The impres- sions were about eight inches deep at the apex, and then sloping upward to an area that was rounded and smooth. The lines of the impression were \"very distinctly made\" Closer to the car, three more imprints were found. They formed a perfect triangle. From where the first two imprints were found, leading to within 12 feet of where the car was, a pattern of conically-shaped imprints were found by the officers. They also were sharp- ly outlined, about nine inches in diameter and six inches deep. They were staggered as if made by a walk- ing creature. The patrolmen said the prints were five or six feet apart. Later in -the dayV 'the sameMmprints were found leading to the water of Lake Erie. The officers were particularly intrigued by the markings on the imprints which appeared to have been made by claws. They said, \"It was like if you were to take your four fingers and press hard on the sand.\" They were also amazed by the sharpness of the impression in the soft sand.

There were seven eyewitnesses, all staff members of the criminal identification section of the NPA. One of them, Ryozo Wata- nabe, 34, first spotted the object cir- cling over the Imperial Palace, about 400 meters from the NPA building, at about 6:30 p.m., while he was work- ing on the fourth floor. After hearing Watanabe's cry of \"UFO!\", six other staff members rushed to the windows and all saw the object moving around the Imperial Palace.

Moore, 14, was fishing with friends near Newberry, South Carolina around 10:30 p.m. on the 15th, when he saw a large cigar- shaped craft land on the water. The weather was excellent, with a clear sky and a temperature of 75 .degrees. Carl and his friends 1 had been fishing that day, but with very little luck. They had only a few fish to show for their efforts and were on their cots for a rest. Carl decided to go down to the boat ramp and check his trot lines, so he was alone when he observed the UFO. The Continued on page 22 MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 279 July 1991"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"Letters to the Editor... Dear Editor: Dennis Stacy has written a well- reasoned and learned piece on the sub- ject of hoaxes and crop circles (Hoaxes and a Whole Lot More, June 1991), and he raises a number of questions that strongly beg to be answered. Since I have been to England, as has Stacy, and have been working on speculative decodings (see page 15, June 1991) and have also been in close contact with many of the major investigators, I would like to try to answer Editor Stacy's points, if I may. 1) First, Stacy quite rightly is suspicious of \"Captain Kirk's\" claim to have hoaxed the Doons Law circles. We do not know for certain that there were three members of the crew, nor do we have any means of asking ques- tions of the anonymous \"Captain Kirk\" (would you buy a hoaxed circle from this man?\"), and the entire claim of hoaxing could be the pipedream of a high school kid sitting (sic) a typewriter, planning to fool the Glascow (sic) Herald. It is my experience from Bigfoot and Loch Ness research that newspapers will print ANY stupid story or claim, as long as it claims to debunk an alleged anomalistic event. We do not know if Captain Kirk is real, or if he, or anyone, really did such a hoax. Talk is cheap. 2) Stacy also points out a great deal of complexity was found in the forma- tion, and this gets so complicated that he asks \"Am I making myself clear?\" \"No?\" \"Then you begin to appreciate the difficulties ...\" And to this, I agree, I could not follow the description, and I doubt three hoaxers with a plank had the intelligence and drive to do such a complicated formation. 3) It is asked if Haddington had con- sidered the wind currents, etc., so as to be able to rule out the vortex theory in this case. I think that George Wingfield's excellent letter on page 21 makes it clear that this didn't HAVE to be considered. Circular vortices, not proven to exist anyway, could not create a complex formation of this type, because such vortices have no in- telligence nor guidance, and the forma- tion shows that intelligence when (sic) into making it. The vortex theory is quite dead, and Haddington recognizes this, and has saved his effort. 4) Back to hoaxing, it is my position that an extraordinary claim, such as the making of an extraordinary circles-set, require (sic) extraordinary PROOF, and at minimum, the correct names and ad-, dresses of hoaxers should be given, and overall, a videotape showing that they indeed, did make that formation, would be required. If they have trouble mak- ing such a video, then they should not complain if nobody accepts their ex- traordinary claim. 5) I deny that crop circles are very easy to hoax. Simple circles, perhaps, but such circles as Alton Barnes, Winterbourne Stoke, Stanton St. Ber- nard, and Hazeley Farm, no- not on your life. These are not easy to hoax, and nobody has done a good demonstration yet as to how such could be done, and done well, and in what time, much less how it could be done in the dark, without $3000 goggles of night vision equipment, on EACH par- ticipant, again, without a farmer see- ing them, nor any crop watchers nor any car drivers, walking lovers, or postmen seeing them. The burden is on the hoaxer. Thus, the greast (sic) majority of the complicated circles are not hoaxed, until the hoaxer-claimant can come forth and prove irrefutably that they did it, when, how and how long. It is inherently too difficult to do. With- out such proof, the circles are not hoaxes. 6) Translations - Stacy really doesn't address this issue, but takes umbrage at the idea that the complexity of the patterns represents any sort of message. He asks, in paraphrase, why a non-human intelligence would waste its time carving messages in crops (?). And the answer is not totally known, since these non-human intelligences (could we call them aliens?) haven't sat down with us to explain their reason- ing process, no more than we do when we deal with hyenas in the veld. We do what we want with hyenas, and aliens do what they want, with humans. Ours is not to question why ... ours is but to shut up and learn. I can however, speculate that they cut the messages in order to impress us that they are \"here\" with us, and they use as a black-board a renewable resource that makes no nasty scarring marks on Mother Earth. Fits in well with various alleged alien ecological messages. Neat and elegant. 7) Are the patterns \"too funada- mentally (sic) complex, on their face, to have sprung fullblown from nature ... ? \" The answer is YES, they are. The closest thing that nature can produce to compare with these pat- terns is the snowflake, which is a very symmetrical thing of beauty that can be seen in crystals and in the very cutting of a plant stalk. These patterns in the fields are largely not symmetrical, and show a thoughtful a-symmetry. In fact, to counter the idea that all pictograms would be dou- ble dumb-bells, the \"circlemakers\" (aliens perhaps) started to make curved and very non-symmetrical patterns in August of 1990. This is just one exam- ple that shows that they appear to be listening to us. 8) Hurricanes as some sort of an ex- ample - this I violently disagree with. Hurricanes can be very complex, but the marks that a hurricane leaves on the ground, are a long mishmash of ran- don (sic) destruction. There is no com- parison with crop circles here. 9) Strange that circles didn't \"talk to us\" in the sixties and seventies. - This is (sic) find strange. Why have the circlemakers any obligation to talk to us at all, much less for US to complain that they didn't talk to us sooner? Does the hyena complain that we shoot them in Africa more in the 90's than in the 80's? The aliens who make the circles do it when they jolly well want to, and it is not for us to question nor to complain. We are just mere humans. 10) Translations again - on a spec- ulative basis, I have used the Norse- Celtic Tifinag and Ogam petroglyphic languages to take a stab at making six decodes, using six types of pic- tograms.

In the meantime, we'll confine our response to the above oddly worded remarks. First, I did not say that ' 'a great deal of complexity was found in the (Doon Laws) formation;'' I did in- dicate that it was difficult to picture the formation itself and to try to figure out what might have happened, in light of the claimed hoax, without a graphic diagram to go by. Mr. Beckjord seems to have confused these two issues, among others. He also notes that I \"asked ifHad- dington had considered the wind cur- rents, etc, so as to be able to rule out the vortex theory in this case.\" Again, Mr. Beckjord misstates me. I did not mention or support the vortex theory propounded by Terence Meaden in this context. What I did call attention to was the fact that weather data and naturally occurring topological features now tend to get routinely overlooked in the headlong rush by some cerealogists to establish the miraculous nature of such formations. Well, maybe they're miraculous and maybe they 're not. How can we pretend to know, however, when the prevailing natural conditions and circumstances operant at the time of formation are so studiously ignored in favor of so-called mystical \"align- ments '' with distant man-made struc- tures like churches and standing stones? Eliminate the first set of circumstances before concentrating on the second, in- cluding the possibility, however remote, that the original Doons Law formation may or could have been hoaxed by human hands. There is no indication in Haddington 's original article that a hoax was ever considered, let alone considered and eliminated. Mr. Beckjord also says that ' 'circular vortices (are) not proven to exist anyway.'' We assume he is referring to Meaden's unique plasma-vortex, as all sorts of circular vortices certainly do exist. What, pray tell, does Mr. Beck- jord think dust-devils, waterspouts and tornadoes are: square vortices? The issue of whether a guiding in- telligence is involved in the formation of the more complicated circles is, of course, what some cerealogists are try- ing to determine. Mr. Beckjord simply accepts it as a given. What we do know at this stage is that human intelligence is definitely involved in the creation of some circles. I'm only for finding out which ones. Mr. Beckjord's assertion that a human hoax is an extraordinary claim I find even harder to fathom. His de- mand that hoaxers prove their claims with names, addresses and videotapes is equally absurd. Either he is unaware of, or simply chooses to ignore, the ob- vious fact that anyone entering a farmer's field without permission has committed a punishable offense known as trespassing. Moreover, confessed hoaxers could conceivably be held responsible for damages as well. The \"average\" circle results in about 400 to 500 dollars in damages, since the flattened crop can no longer be machine-harvested. If you were respon- sible for such damages, would you stand up and provide video proof in public? Mr. Beckjord also erroneously assumes/demands that hoaxers would/should carry video cameras in- to a field at night to validate their claims, when of course hoaxers are up to nothing more than perpetrating a hoax. By analogy, we should expect a UFO hoaxer to prove he or she perpetrated a hoax, when the whole purpose of a hoax is to say, \"OK, here it is. Now you go figure out how I did it.\" The demand that each hoaxer wear $3000 night-vision goggles falls on equally fallow ground. Apparently, Mr. Beckjord has never been outdoors at night under a full moon or heard of flashlights. Available night illumination levels, incidentally, are but another argument for recording the extant meteorological conditions at the time of crop circle formation, and of course have nothing to do, one way or the other, with any ' 'vortex theory.'' It is, after all, summertime, and people will play. Aside from Mr. Beckjord's other im- moderate demands, he continues to ig- nore the growing data and body of literature concerning known hoaxes, which is now way too large to cite here, save for the following quote from Thierry Pinvidic of Paris, which ap- peared in The Circular, the quarterly journal of the Centre for Crop Circle Studies, for December 1990: ' 'In June we employed a specialist of 'special ef- fects ' usually working for the cinema and we asked him to design in a wheat field a huge quintuplet with two rings (one clockwise, the second anti- clockwise). He did so within one hour (a shape 70 meters wide!) in the presence of a Court Usher ('Huissiere de Justice').\" (My emphasis added.) Even so, the burden has never been on the back of the hoaxer, and never will be, to prove that a hoax has been committed. The burden is on those self- styled cerealogists who claim that hoaxes don't take place, or who, like Mr. Beckjord, pretend to be able to establish the authenticity of a particular formation by a glance at an aerial photograph. Moreover, however ex- traordinary a hoax claim may be, it cer- tainly can't compete on a level playing field with those who assert, without any physical evidence whatsoever, that the crop circles are being written in ancient terrestrial Tifinag by an alien in- telligence. Mr. Beckjord has so long in- habited the world of the extraordinary that I'm afraid he's no longer able to distinguish between what is indeed or- dinary, extraordinary and what is not. In fact, his claims are the extraordinary ones here, and the ones which require extraordinary proof, with apologies to Carl Sagan and others. True, I did not address the issue of so-called crop cricle ' 'translations'' in my article, mainly because it never came up in connection with the Doons Law formation which was under discussion. As for the question of complexity in nature and its relevance to the crop MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 279 July 1991"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"circle patterns, Mr. Beckjord is wel- come to his own opinions, including the one that snow/lakes are \"the closest thing that nature can produce.'' My own is that snow/lakes are but one of many examples of complex, ordered struc- tures in nature. Nature, in fact, is order, compared with total chaos, else we wouldn 't be here to appreciate the fact. Regarding the example I made of hur- ricanes, however, Mr. Beckjord again purposefully misrepresents, or honest- ly misunderstands, my original point. At no time did I indicate, or intend to indicate, as Mr. Beckjord has it, that the destructive wake left by a hurricane should somehow be compared with the delicate crop circle patterns. How he might have leapt to such a conclusion is a mystery to me. What 1 did indicate was that hurricanes have a complex in- ternal structure not necessarily obvious or identifiable close up, and that they have their origins at a vast remote distance from where they eventually manifest. As I write, in fact, some meteorologists have just hypothesized that drought conditions in eastern Africa play a prominent role in deter- mining both the number and strength of hurricanes that eventually strike the Caribbean. My points were twofold: One, final effects often land a long way away from their original cause, and two; the presence of such a structure in a natural phenomenon, as far as I know, has not yet led anyone to claim or conclude that hurricanes are the product of an alien intelligence, or that they are ' 'written'' in the ancient Tlfinag script, although Mr. Beckjord may wish to correct me on the latter point. — DS Dear Editor: I was sorry to see George Wingfield's insulting and inaccurate letter appear- ing in the May 1991 Journal. Please allow me to correct some of Wingfield's errors. Wingfield was incorrect to claim that none of the meteorologists expressing support for Meaden's theory had actual- ly visited crop circles. Professors Christopher Church (Miami Universi- ty), John Snow (Purdue University), Hiroshi Kikuchi .(Nihon University, Japan), Tokio Kikuchi (Kochi Univer- sity, Japan) and Y.H. Ohtsuki (Waseda University, Japan) all visited British crop circles prior to the 1990 Oxford Conference organized by TORRO. The alleged contravention of physical Laws described by Wingfield don't appear to have caused any great concern to these scientists, none of whom accept the theory being promoted by Wingfield and his colleagues. Wingfield seems unaware that some crop circles display very ragged edges and that the precise cut-off zone is not ubiquitous. Wingfield's vitriolic dismissal of Meaden's theory seems to ignore over two dozen eye witness ac- counts of wind vortices creating crop circles in broad daylight as well as the widespread and long established belief among small pockets of the farming community that crop circles are created by unusual wind vortices. At Ham- bledon in Surrey, on May 17, 1990, two witnesses stood inside a whirlwind that created a crop circle all around them. How can Meaden's theory be dismiss- ed in the light of such powerful evidence? In Japan Professor Y.H. Ohtsuki has now recreated the circles effect by fir- ing mini wind-vortices at a thin layer of aluminium powder. Ohtsuki's ex- periments resulted in the creation of a ringed circle some 10mm in diameter. In Illinois Sheldon Wernikoff has repeatedly created a set of five equidis- tant vortices inside a capsule contain- ing neon and argon. Details appear in Meaden's new book, Circles from the Sky (Souvenir Press). If Meaden's theory is wrong, why have the meteorologists successfully recreated basic crop circle patterns in the laboratory? Britain's leading expert in lodging, Dr. John Graham of Shuttleworth Col- lege of Agronomy, has publicly ex- pressed his opinion that crop circles are the result of \"air moving in a circular configuration of velocities in excess of 50m/sec.\" David Reynolds and myself have examined the weather conditions during 20 of Britian's best close en- counter cases, including vehicle in- terference cases. In two-thirds of the en- counters the pre-requisites for Meaden's theory were met superbly. Details will be published in The Crop Watcher magazine. How can Wingfield claim that we have been \"stupid\" to entertain such an exciting theory that may be capable of explaining a whole range of anomalous phenomena? Surely as responsible UFOlogists we all seek an explanation for the UFO enigma, so how can our attempts to do so be la- belled \"stupid\"? — Paul Fuller Circles Effect Research Unit (CERES) UFO NEWSCLIPPING SERVICE The UFO Newsclipping Service will keep you informed of all the latest United States and World-Wide UFO reports (i.e., little known photographic cases, close encounters and landing reports, occupant cases) and all other UFO reports, many of which are car- ried only in small town and foreign newspapers.

Webb August 1991 Bright Planets: (Evening Sky) Venus might be visible very low in the west briefly after sunset the first few days of August. It moves into the morning sky late in the month. Mars (magnitude 1.8), in Leo, is dimly seen very low in the west, setting an hour after the Sun in mid-August. Jupiter has vanished from the evening sky, officially shifting into the morning sky around midmonth. Saturn (0.2), in Capricornus, lies low in the SE at dusk and advances westward during the night. Bright Planets: (Morning Sky) Saturn sets in the WSW about 4 AM in mid-August. Meteor Shower: This year's Perseid display is unhampered by moonlight and so the shower's peak on the morning of the 12th should be worth staying up for. These bright, yellow meteors increase to about 50 or more per hour before dawn, radiating from the region near the Cassiopeia/Perseus border in the NE. Among them are fireballs leaving behind a trail that may remain in the sky for some seconds after the main body has disappeared. If the forecast is unfavorable, look for the Perseids on the previous or following morning. Moon Phases: Last quarter — August 3 New moon — August 9 First quarter — August 17 Full moon — August 25 The Stars: Late in the evening that stellar trio making up the Summer Triangle — Vega, Deneb and Altair — takes center stage high overhead. Located within the borders of the triangle are several famous objects observable through small telescopes. The first is the Ring Nebula between the bottom two stars in Lyra the Harp's crooked rectangle. The diffuse object is nearer the righthand star, Beta Lyrae. Higher magnifications resolve a fuzzy, 9th-magnitude \"star\" into an oval \"smoke ring.\" Called a planetary nebula because of its roughly circular shape, this object is a spherical shell of gas spewed from a collapsing faint star in the center. Our own star is expected.to pass through the same process some five billion years hence. The second object happens to be another planetary nebula, the Dumbbell, situated in Vulpecula the Fox. Although appearing like its namesake in small instruments, its true circular shape becomes evident in large telescopes. The Dumbbell's position is at R.A. 20h 00m, Dec. +22° 43'. Finally, find Eta Cygni in the neck of Cygnus the Swan and sweep half a degree to the east. The brightest (9th magnitude) of a pair of faint stars is the visible component of the well known black-hole candidate, Cygnus X-l. The invis- ible companion is thought to be vacuuming matter off its neighbor. A black hole is the endpoint in the life of some supermassive stars which explode and then collapse into a gravitational- ly intense tiny object where even light cannot escape from it. The visible neighbor is located at 19h 58m, +35° 10'. The distances of the Ring, Dumbbell and Cygnus X-l are 5,000, 3,500 and 8,000 light years, respectively. LOOKING BACK, Continued craft was a 30-foot long glowing silver- white cigar-shaped object. It was fly- ing very slowly over the water. It slowly settled on the surface of the water caus- ing steam to rise around it. After about three minutes it ascended slightly and hovered about one foot above the sur- face. Suddenly it shot skyward, rising vertically until it was out of sight. When the craft landed on the water, it was less than 50 feet from Carl.
