Carolina DATES OF SIGHTINGS: April 3, A, 5, 6, 1975. etc. LOCATIONS OF SIGHTINGS: Lum-, berton and Pembroke, N.C., and surrounding areas. SOURCES OF INFORMATION: THE ROBESONIAN and THE LUMBERTON POST of Lumberton, N.C. (MUFON investigators Lee Spiegel and Ted Phillips were at the scene, but no formal, written reports have been submitted by them thus far.) The news stories, sketches and photo were ob- tained by SKYLOOK staff member Joe Brill; the article was written by Dwight Connelly. An alleged UFO landing near Pembroke, N.C., on April 6 -has been the high point thus far in a rash of sightings in the five counties of Rbbeson, Cumber- land, Hoke, Sampson, and Bladen in the southeastern section of the state. The first reported sighting was on Wednesday, April 3, at 1:^5 a.m. when Lumberton police officers Phil Stanton, Neil Mc- Cormick, and P. H. Atkinson saw a V-shaped \"thing\" moving 200- 300 feet above the ground. RED LIGHTS The \"craft\" was described as having a row of red lights on one side and a row of green lights on the other. The ob- ject also had two spotlights, according to the officers. Police at St. Pauls, 15 miles north of Lumberton, were contacted and told to be on the alert for the object, which was moving in their direction. Of- ficers R. T. Higgins and John McPasson sighted the object two miles south of St. Pauls. The two said they saw a blinding flash of light which, according to McPherson, \"just lit up the woods like a giant flash bulb.\" He said it was something like an explosion. McPherson said he could see the outline of trees silhouet- ted against the light, leading him to believe the object was hovering near the ground or was on the ground. The two witnesses spotted the object two additional times, a- bout 20 feet off the ground and later as it zoomed to about 300 feet. The speed was estimated at.200 m.p.h. The fields and woods around the sighting area were inspect- ed later, but nothing was found. McPherson said .it had been stormy, but it was not raining at the time he saw the craft. He said the object was about the size of a twin-engine Cessna and made no sound. IN HOKE COUNTY . Following the sighting near St. Pauls, the object was re- ported in Hoke County,\" north- west of St. Pauls and home of the Ft. Bragg Military Reser- vation. Hoke County officers also described the object as V- shaped and lighted. From Hoke, the object—fol- lowed by officers—traveled in- to Cumberland County, east of Hoke County. From Cumberland County the object continued east to Roseboro in Sampson County. A Roseboro police officer, Jim Driver, said the object slowly passed over -him about 100 feet above the ground, making no noise. When he got out of his car, he said a spot- light came on, intensified, and the craft took off at high speed. He said he followed the craft to Garland, \\k miles southeast, where he discontin- ued the chase. ' The craft was reported at Elizabethtown in Bladen County, 2k miles due east of Lumberton, about *t5 minutes later. , Pol ice Officer Bullock confirmed the sighting in Elizabethtown, and citizens claimed the object's searchlights bathed the town in light.  :' From Elizabethtown the object moved to the south, where it was sighted in ColumbusiCounty at about 6:55 a.m., five min- utes before sunrise.

Three of the areas of ash are shown in the above photo (the areas have been circled with a pen on the photo). the last report. Weather conditions for the Lumberton area on the night of the sightings featured a vio- lent thunderstorm and \"particu- larly vivid\" lightning flashes. High winds, driving rain^ and intense lightning lasted sev- •eral hours, including .part'of the time of the UFO observa- tions. The Fayetteville airport in Cumberland County reportedly had no radar contact with any UFO during the period of the sightings.^' Ronald Thompson, a dispatcher with the Robeson County Sheriff Department and a UFO enthusi- ast, said he did not give any description of the UFO when notifying other police units, and that he was \"amazed\" at the similarity of descriptions radioed back to him. Thompson said he contacted air bases and airfields as far away as Myrtle Beach, but none reported having planes in the area. A spokesman for the Fed- eral Aviation Administration initially said the-UFO sight- ings were of a Piedmont Air- lines Boe.ing Delta Jet. making test runs. Later the FAA re- versed this statement, saying there were no airplanes in the area at the time of the sight- ings REPORTS CONTINUE On the evening of Thursday, April. 3, the sighting reports continued, with eight law of- ficers and numerous citizens allegedly making observations. Some of the citizen reports were admitted hoaxes, however. A possible landing was re- ported in Robeson County on NC Ik at \\:kS a.m. (April 4) near .the residence of Evander Par- nell. Parnell said a craft ap- peared to have been .on the ground in a wooded area, and it reportedly rose to a height of 300 feet, then disappeared,, The sighting reports con- tinued on Friday evening, April *f, as dispatcher Thompson al- legedly saw a flying object at 9:15 p.m. in the Midway commun- ity. He said the object ap- proached from the southeast and then stopped and hovered about 300 feet away. Thompson says he shut off his engine and flashed .his head- lights at the craft, and that the object flashed a search- light back before taking off in a westerly direction behind some trees. TWO SEARCHLIGHTS Thompson described the craft as being 30 feet in diameter and having two searchlights, one on 1 the bottom and one on the front. He said the V-shaped object was also illuminated from the inside. It made no noise. Also on Friday, at White Lake, eight miles east of Eliz- abethtown, Police Chief Gary Moore reported that he was driving a lakeside road about Page 4"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"50 m.p.h. when a UFO came down and \"the whole side of the road lit up like it was daylight.\" Moore says he continued about 300 yards before stopping his car and getting out. \"I looked in the air and the light was so bright I had to look back.\" He then got his binoculars out and looked at the object. \"Then I got an airplane landing light that I. carry in my patrol car,\" he related, \"and I shined it. up there. I blinked the light and it blinked back.\" ANOTHER GOOD LOOK Moore says he \"took another good look at it with the binoc- ulars\" before the object moved west toward Lumberton. He said he followed it about two miles, going as fast as 85 m.p.h. in his patrol car, but \"it left me.\" He-said that after the object blinked its light it \"went straight up and out\" at an est- imated 200 m.p.h. '. . Describing the object from his vantage point of about 200 feet at one time, Moore said the craft was V-shaped with lights around one big light \"that looked double the size of the steering wheel of a car.\" The object reportedly lit up an area of about 500 feet on either stde of the road, and several other drivers reported- ly stopped to view the object through Moore's binoculars dur- ing the five minutes the craft was hovering. A state patrolman reported a slow-moving flying craft about 2 a.m. Saturday (April 5) near Saddletree. He said the object was about 300 yards away at his closest observation, and that it had brilliant orange and reddi'sh 1 ights. The first daylight sighting and verified landing came at 5:15 p.m. Sunday, April 6. Ray Strickland, a Pembroke State University campus policeman; his wife; and children observed five UFOs (or one UFO, depend- ing upon later interpretation) on the Philadelphus Road : one mile north of Pembroke. •-' Driver's sighting Moore's sketch. Unlike the V-shaped UFO re- ported .previously, the sighting by the Stricklands involved what appeared to be five cir- cular objects, in a circular formation about 100 feet off the ground, traveling about 50 m.p.h. . . Strickland said his wife was afraid the objects were going to crash into a house located in a nearby field. The objects were a formation of pinkish-red 1ights, and behind each object was a bluish trai 1 ..or .\"streak.\" He .said the objects were sev- eral feet apart. The objects appeared to land in a potato patch,' so Strick- land went to his home two miles away\\ to call someone to the scene quickly. Dispatcher Thompson arrived from, the sheriff's office with a photographer, but all that was left were five circular ash .patches which had not been there previously. Each 'patch was about a foot in diameter, and comparable in overall pat- tern to the. format ion\" observed by the Stricklands. .The ash is described as \"a strange blue\" in color. Additional witnesses !to the landing or near landing'observ- ed .by the Stricklands have been located by' Ted Phillips, who investigated the landing . for the Center for UFO Studies. A small boy playing i,'\\.n the area said the objects '(;6r ob- ject) kicked up a cloud of dust as high as a house. ONE OBJECT OR FIVE? While Strickland thought he saw five, objects in formation, other witnesses viewing the phenomenon from other angles say they saw a chrome-like at- tachment between each ;..light, making one connected object. Phillips was reportedly in- terested in. a ci rcular .impres- sion found at the site, saying he had not seen . .anything .like it before. He also reportedly said that he had not previously heard of lights being seen on a UFO in daytime. A hole which some,observers thought might be a landi,rig gear indentation reportedly did not impress Phillips, since, there were no other .similar holes to form a landing gear pattern. Phillips was reportedly:puz- zled at the lack of damage to plants located very near the six patches of ash. He also appeared surprised that ,'no one saw the UFO leave the site. Phillips is quoted as say- ing that \"it's very difficult to imagine .,what the ash could have resulted from.\" The ash and soil samples are to^be an- alysed, by the Center for UFO Studies or a,participating lab. \"Right now I see no conven- tional answer to what happened out there,\" Phillips is quoted as saying. : \"But as far as a landing site providing I infor- mation, it!s, not particularly .interesting ;., unless analysis shows something, extraordinary.\" Page 5"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"CIA declassifies Robertson Panel Report By Ann Druffel On Jan. 21, 1975, the Robert- son Pane-1 Report, long an enig- ma to UFO researchers, was de- classified at the request of a MUFON investigator who was seeking additional material for a project TV documentary. This action by the CIA might be a small stepping stone to- ward government disclosure on UFOs. A brief history of the Robertson Panel might be appli- cable here. In 1953 the U.S. Air Force had an immense prob- lem on its hands. The 1,900 UFO reports which had flooded in during 1952 had choked mili- tary communication channels. Officials surmised that a potential enemy might possibly create a fake UFO flap to give t ! iem advantage while launching an unexpected missile attack a- gainst our nation. \" CIA HELP REQUESTED The Air Force sought help from the Central Intelligence Agency (CI A), perhaps assuming, with topsy-turvy reasoning, that an agency more secret than themselves would be better to advise on the problem. Evidently the alternate ap- proach of open, scientific in- quiry, adequately financed by government, funds, was never cons idered. Now positive proof is avail- able that the CIA was the agen- cy directly responsible for the inane and inhumane \"debunking policy\" used by government agencies for seventeen full years. This policy of ridicule and de-emphasization was em- ployed to embarrass UFO wit- nesses, deny reports, and to confuse the American public a- bout the importance of this in- triguing phenomenon. Certain officials were of the opinion, even in 1953, that the UFOs were a matter of scientific interest. Therefore, a group of prestigious American scientists was selected, and the panel — later called the Robertson Panel—was convened. The declassified report states plainly that the panel was convened at the request of the director of Scientific In- telligence (CIA), and authority over it was delegated to the assistant director of Sientific Intelligence (AD/SI, CIA). SCIENTIFIC PANEL The Robertson Panel was of- ficially a scientific advisory panel.of the CIA. But the re- sults of the panel, as written in the Robertson Report, were anyth.ing but scientific. They set back meaningful research on UFOs at least twenty years,, The panel was composed of Dr. H.P. Robertson, a mathemat- ical physicist, experienced in relativity, cosmology, and war- time intelligence missions; Dr. Luis Alvarez, a nuclear physi- cist who, among other achieve- ments, co-invented the GCA sys- tem for tracking aircraft in fog and rain; Dr. Thornton Page, astronomer and underseas weapons genius; Dr. SamuelA. Goudsmit, discoverer of the theory of electron-spin; Dr. Lloyd V. Berkner, expert on ionospheric research and ter- restrial magnetism. These scientists, together with selected CIA personnel, associate scientists, and Blue Book personnel who had studied the UFO problem-first hand, met on Jan. ]k, 1953. A speedy four days and eight meetings later, they filed two \"results\" to the CIA, The first \"results,\" append- ed to the Robertson Report as \"Tab A,\" concluded the follow- ing: 1. That the UFOs were not hostile and did not indicate a need for revision of current scientific concepts; 2. That the emphasis on UFO reports would be a threat to the orderly functioning of the protective organs of the body politic; 3. That national security agencies should strip the UFOs of their aura of mystery; and k. That national security agencies should institute poli- cies of intelligence training and public education. The second \"results,\" also called the \"final report,\" ap- pended to the Robertson Report as \"Tab C,\" is still under re- view, and the CIA has refused declassification of it to this date. In 1966 the late Dr. James E. McDonald came upon a copy of the Robertson Report in Blue Book Headquarters where he was studying the UFO problem first hand. The Report had been \"routinely declassified under the 12-year rule\" by Project Officer Hector Quintan!1 la. C ^RESPONSIBLE £•\"••. McDonald made extensive notes and was the first to discover that the CIA was responsible for the \"debunking policy\" of the Air Force from 1953 through 1969. He requested a Xerox copy of the Report, but before it was given him, the CIA inter- fered and re-classified the re- port. Dr. McDonald treated the in- formation in his notes as open information in no way affecting the security of • the United States and shared the facts of CIA involvement. freely with other researchers and interest- ed members of the media. -An-unsatisfactory \"sanitized\" version of the Report was re- leased later by the Air Force at the request of aircraft man- ufacturer John Lear. But in this partial version everything concerning the CIA's involve- ment was deleted. It was not Page 6"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"until January, 1975, that the CIA admitted openly, through declassification, their part in the absurd debunking policy. We can only wonder why the CIA has chosen this time to de- classify. The action came about almost\" by accident. While writing a segment of a projected TV documentary—a segment concerning the part the Robertson Panel played in the history of UFO research in the U.S.—on a whim I wrote the CIA in November, 197^, requesting a declassifed copy of the Report. I was aware of the sanitized version, but felt it was un- satisfactory and therefore \"played dumb\"; in writing for the declassified copy. A GRAND SURPRISE It was a grand surprise to receive a letter from a Mr. Robert Young, \"Records Manage- ment Officer,\" stating that the Agency could provide a declas- sified copy, consisting of 28 pages, for .10 per page. The necessary $2.80 was speedily transmitted to the CIA, and late in January the declassified report arrived. However, though plainly showing CIA involvement, including spe- cific names of CIA personnel and departments, involved in the debunking policy, the Report was missing Tab B and Tab C. I inquired about this, and Mr. Young wrote back on Feb. 19. He now signed himself, \"Freedom of Information Coord- inator.\" .It is wondered wheth- er the trouble the CIA was fac- ing concerning 'illegal inter- ference in domestic affairs had anything to do with his change of title! The Feb. 19 letter confirmed that Tab B, which was described in the Repo'rt's Index as \"a list of personnel concerned with meetings,\" could hot be declassified. However, he sent the sanitized version, which is already available in the Condon Report. But Tab B of the sani- tized version turned out to be a brief list of the evidence presented to the Robertson Panel during the eight meet- ings! Mr. Young also stated-that Tab \"C\" was still under review; that is, still classified \"Sec- ret Security Information.\" He stated he would notify promptly of the results of that review, but I've not heard from him since. According to the Index of the declassifed Report, Tab C was supposed to be a \"list of documentary evjdence present- ed.\" This, however, is covered in the sanitized Tab B! CLASSIFIED REPORT Tab C, in reality, is the classified \"final report\" of ; the Panel, which has never been made public. Perhaps not even Dr. McDonald saw this Tab C. We cannot 'be certain. Accord- ing to the text of the declas- sified Robertson Report, Tab C was the \"final report.\" It evidently differs, in what ways we do not know, with the de- classifed \"results\" known as Tab A. The field of ufology. has been enriched by the CIA's declassi- fication of the Robertson Re- port. But Tab B and particu- larly Tab C still remain \"secret.\" Why? Demands should be made upon the CIA, or perhaps the Rocke- feller Committee which is in- vestigating the CIA, for re- lease of these documents. Other persons who may want copies.of the declassifed Rob- ertson Report can send $2.80 to Mr. Robert .

To my surprise, I found that less than a third of these cases were described in the literature.

An unresolved discrepancy. It is true that Dr. David Saunders' UFOCAT now contains date and location references for the majority of Air Force \"unknown\" cases, but whether descriptions of the sightings exist is not clear, and in any event there are no publicly available descriptions of these sightings. The two salient findings of this study are (a) that we have never been able to read des- criptions of J2% of the cases that puzzled the Air Force; and (b) that for all its preten- sions, the Colorado Project ex- amined only 1% of these cases. Don Berliner, an aviation writer and former member of the NICAP staff, has done addition- al research on the Air Force \"unknowns\" in connection with a book on the history of the Air Force UFO project. His book would make a valuable addition to the 1iterature. Object from sky strikes tractor The NICAP UFO INVESTIGATOR reports that a piece of ceram- ic-like material \"golf-ball sized\" and weighing about one pound apparently fell from the sky and struck a tractor on Jan. 12, 1975, near Carlisle, N.Y. After striking the tractor, the object landed on a patch of ice and quickly melted through it. The object is apparently not from any conventional aircraft or satellite, nor does it ap- pear to be a meteorite. Through the efforts of Dr. J. Allen Hynek, the object was examined at Northwestern Uni- versity. According to a pre- liminary analysis, the object contains iron, has a rust col- oration, is.magnetic, and has experienced extreme thermal shock.

This report involving two young boys as witnesses is an- ecdotal, lacking personal on- the-spot follow up for techni- cal details. This is a result of the parents of one boy being reluctant to allow his son to relate additional information and a drawing of the UFO, which I had requested. Fortunately, in this case, I got. the preliminary details by phone from the two young wit- nesses, which follow: Peter (last name on file), age 10, and Chris (last name on file), age 8, were playing to- gether after school at Chris 1 home. Chris saw the UFO first about 5:30 p.m. in gray skies; watched it for about two min- utes before Peter could get to the window. Chris said the gray metallic object was quite low, .about \"twice as high as the tree tops.\" He said it was \"oval and large like a blimp with lines or indents,\" which he described as running horizontally from the front to the rear. \"It had no wings or windows,\" he said, \"but around the body was a large gray ring like Saturn that was not attached to the body.\" He added, \"The ring seemed to move slowly around the body, and it had little 1 ights on it.\" On the top of the oboid ob- ject, Chris described a \"dome that lighted up brightly; a sort of yellowish light.\" Chris then described his observation This is the drawing made by Peter of the object which he and Chris say they saw over a school in Cincinatti, Ohio.     : of \"something like a steering wheel\" at the top and bottom of the rear end of the craft. The UFO's appearance .was over a heavy residential area known, as Hyde Park in the heart of Cincinnati. I thought it was significant that the UFO's .location was above, or near the Hyde Park School, as schools seem to be \"common ground\" for UFO surveillance, known in UFO research,, Chris said, the UFO came from the east, then moved slowly to the northwest in a \"slight curving and tipping\" motion, or as I could best-determine, in a swerve to the northwest. He said it did not change speed or hover, left no vapor or smoke, made no sound,, and disappeared into the clouds. Chris said, \"It was sort of weird, and I was frightenedo\" Peter was called to the win- dow, and most of his descrip- tion of the UFO is similar to Chris 1 . He said he saw it for about a minute. \"It was cigar shaped,\" he said, \"of dull gray color, and it was made of metal.\" He said it was still 1ight. outdoors and the UFO was very clear in the .sky above Hyde Park School. He also des- cribed the lighted dome on top, which he said was .\"green\" (Chris said \"yeMow\") and that \"it blinked.\" Peter said the object was a- bove the tree tops and in,clear view; that it was \"without any wings, but it had rings around it.\" I asked for details on the rings and he said it ap- peared to be \"three rings close together or just one wide ring.\" He said the body was \"oval rather than round, and at the end of it was a tail stuck up at the top.,.all of it was dull gray.\" Peter also described the craft as moving in a curve, adding, \"You could see it bare-- ly, barely, barely turn to the right in the direction of the school.\" He said he didn't hear any sound and he couldn't see how the UFO disappeared \"because trees were i;n the .way.\" I asked Peter if he was in- terested in UFOs, or read books about them. He said that he .\"didn't get into the subject,\" but.he did watch a TV show a- bout UFOSo Peter's mother was concerned about his delay in returning from Chris 1 and called, re- questing that he get home. When she\" learned of the incident, the poMce were called. : To compile my report, I re- quested from Chris and Peter their individual drawings of the object they witnessed. Peter was prompt in sending me his drawing. '. Chris' drawing never arrived, Page 9"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"so I followed up by phone eight times, and on each try, I was told by some member of the fam- ily that he was not at home. With both drawings, my next hopeful move was to have a meeting with the boys on loca- tion. Finally, I reached Chris by phone Feb. 8, 1975. I asked a- bout his drawing he promised and he said, \"My dad was lis- tening on the other phone to our talking about the UFO I saw and got mad at me.\" He said the father \"would not allow me to send the drawing I made.\" I asked to speak to his father, but he was out of town. Chris said his drawing was different from Peter's. I asked how did it differ? He indicated that it was the' \"ring,\" and added, \"but I saw it longer than Peter.\" Unquestionably, the two boys witnessed an unidentifiable aerial object maneuvering at low level over a residential district of Cincinnati.

Fowler, MUFON director of investigations and author of the book \"UFOs: In- terplanetary Visitors,\" has done a superb job in composing and editing this outstanding contribution to UFOlogy, dedi- cated to providing the methods and techniques for interview- ing and gathering the raw data on reported UFO sightings. Recognition must also be be- stowed upon the following indi- viduals who either wrote sec- tions on their field of exper- tise or contributed in a major way: .Ted Phillips, Adrian Vance, David Webb, Ted Bloe- cher, Ron West rum, Robert Stin- son, Fred Youngren, John Os- wald, Joe Santangelo, J 0 Allen Hynek, John Acuff, Rubin Sil- ver, Walter Webb, and Walt Andrus. The nine distinct question- naire forms have been printed, and the manual was sent to the printer on April 28. Distribu- tion of the manual to \"paid-up\" MUFON members will be announced in the June issue of SKYLOOK, and copies will be available at the UFO Symposium in Des Moines, Iowa, on July 5. . However, we expect ~ to mail copies to state directors and others prior to this date. This manual will also be used by the independent investigators for the Center for UFO Studies. Both Dr. Hynek and your Direc- tor have Xeroxed copies in finished form. As previously announced, the 8?X11\" pages will be printed on both sides with standard 3 punch holes for 3 ring or clasp binders. INTERNATIONAL COORDINATOR It is with regret that we announce the resignation of Joe Brill as international coordin- ator. Joe has systematically developed a world-wide group of foreign representatives in over thirty countries' to provide liaison between MUFON and the UFO organizations in their re- spective nationso His specialization of \"UFOs Behind the Iron Curtain\" will continue unabated, since he will be sharing his vast reser- voir of information by continu- ing as a staff writer for SKY- LOOK. Joe's resignation will be effective May 31, 1975. In order to retain the con- tinuity of .correspondence with our network of foreign repre- sentatives, we are taking this opportunity for announcing Joe's successor in.this impor- tant position on the board of directors of MUFON. Richard H. Hall, presently state director for Maryland and Washington, D. C., has accepted the ^position of international coordinator. Richard was formerly the as- sistant director of NICAP when Major Donald E. Keyhoe was its director. He is best known for his publication THE UFO EVI- DENCE and co-authoring a book with Professor Meany. Richard brings to this position matur- ity and experience based upon his outstanding \"track record\" of the past. Our foreign representatives, who receive a complimentary subscription to SKYLOOK from MUFON, should record Richard's mailing address. He resides at M18 39th Street, Brentwood, Maryland, 20722, U, S.

Dunn, coord- inator for the Ralph Mueller Planetarium, University of Ne- braska at Lincoln, with selec- tion of slides by Elmer A. Krai, MUFON state director for Nebraska. It is composed of 160 slides, many from the. collection of Walt Ahdrus, with a playing time'of'thirty-five-minutes. It is professionally produced and written .by Jack Dunn, narrated by- Don Jacks, photography by Terrence Winslow, and graphics by Mohler and Grubbs. When we say this is the first rendition, -we mean that it is already being updated, revised, and improved as of this writing to make it even more effective as a program that may be given as an introduction to the UFO phenomena to any assembled group as part of MUFON's public awareness program. Everyone in MUFON should be immensely proud that we have dedicated people like Elmer Krai . and Jack Dunn \"doing their thing\" for UFO research. This film will be shown during the afternoon workshop session on July 6 in Des Moines at the UFO Symposium.

J. (Dub) Mi 11s On Dec. 21, 197**, at approx- imately 11:30 p.m. Kim Lloyd, Rodney Walta, and Jeff Walta left Darmstadt, returning to New Athens. They were traveling west; it was a clear night with full moon and bright stars. Kim was driving, Rodney was riding in the front seat with her, and Jeff was in the back seat. At a point approximately four miles west of Darmstadt, they were suddenly aware of a bright light illuminating the area around them; Rodney was the first to see the object. He looked out his window to . the north, at about a forty-five degree angle and saw this brightly Ut disk- shaped object descending. Ex- citingly calling it to the at- tention of Kim and Jeff, they .too saw it as it descended into their field of vision. The object was descending at an angle, with the leading edgn lower than the trailing edge and the descent Was such so they were seeing the top of the object; it was probably twenty or thirty feet in di- ameter.. It had rotating lights around the lower edge of the rim that were red and yellow,- red and ysllow in that sequence all the way around. • There appeared to be portholes around the ob- ject; 11 had something resemb- ling antennas that were coming out each side of the dome and coming up as if they were going to meet at a point up above the dome of the object itself. The color of the \"antennas\" appear- ed to be blue. The object continued its descent and appeared to be in the process of landing in a wooded area that was approxi- mately one thousand feet from the road the youths were tra- veling. At a point where the object was fifty feet above the trees they lost sight of it momentarily due to the eleva- tion of the field on that side of the road. OBJECT GONE At that particular point you could not see the woods, and their vision was obscured here for probably five or ten sec- onds. When they were again able to see the same area where the object was descending, it was gone. The entire time involved here from the. time they first saw the object up until this particular moment was no more than two or three minutes and a driving distance of no more than perhaps a mile, perhaps less. They were so certain that it had landed they began driving down roads and lanes in and a- round the area in an effort to relocate it. Feeling certain it was on or near the ground and would be obscured by the trees and other terrain, they felt that in patrol ing in these areas they would have a chance of spotting it. However, after probably thirty or forty min- utes they gave up the search and drove into New Athens. In New Athens they ran into some of their friends and pur- suaded them to accompany them back to the area for another search. Again they went through this patrol ing for perhaps an hour. By this time, the friends had lost interest and returned to New Athens^ However, Kim, Rodney and Jeff were not yet ready to give up the search, so they drove around a little while longer and finally parked the car to set up a watch for any further sign of their elu- sive U.F.O. or anything else that might come along. INVESTIGATION OF AREA I checked out this area quite thoroughly on Jan.12. It was a beautiful sunshiny day and quite cold. The ground .was frozen, but I am told by the witnesses that the night of the sighting was confortably warm and that the ground was muddy. I discovered no trace of a landing. The day I was there I did discover a huge clearing in the wooded area. I was accompanied by Rodney, and he felt this would have been approximately where the object was des- cending when they lost sight of it. This area was approximate- ly fifty yards wide by one hun- dred yards deep. It could have been used for a landing site, with no one from the surround- ing area being able to see ito UNIDENTIFIED TRACKS I did discover tracks I can- not identify. The tracks be- gan in a section of the clear- ing and they also abruptly end- ed as if they were made by something or someone stepping onto the ground, and at approx- imately a point thirty-five feet away they stepped back on to whatever. In other words, the tracks abruptly began and abruptly ended. I made some photographs of these tracks. As I type this I have not received the film back so I can't really tell you if the photos turned out well or if they did not. If they did, they w-i 1 1 be attached to this report. So that you have something as a matter of information, these tracks were similar to paw . or hoof marks, yet they were not any kind of paw or hoof marks I am familiar with» Since I have done considerable Page 12"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"hunting over the years, I am familiar with many wild game tracks and am quite familiar with domestic animal [tracks. I am certain neither would fit the case and I feel these tracks were made by a two-leg- ged being with a stride of per- haps forty inches. For me to stride along side of these tracks I had to stride in very exaggerated long strides. I would say my normal stride is between thirty and thirty-six inches. In carefully examin- ing these marks I would esti- mate that the prints were four JL to five inches wide, seven to i eight inches long. I am sorry I did not have a ruler along f with me. the imprints were one inch to one-half inch into .the ground, which at that time would have been soft and muddy. The prints were reasonably clear and seemed to have been made by a multi-toe foot. I really can't be more specific than this. I checked with several neigh- bors in this area regarding i anything they may have heard or seen at the time of the sight- ing. Being a farm area, and considering the time, no one could shed any additional light on the subject. ACTIVITY CONTINUES While phase one was apparent- ly over, the activities of the night were only beginning for Kim, Rodney and Jeff. They had parked their car at an intersection facing, north, ^ with the Darmstadt road going east and west in front of their car. At about four thirty t which would now be the morning of Dec. 22, in the northeast at about sixty degrees and very high, they noticed a light that first looked like a star„ As they watched it, the light be- gan to gyrate and hop around. It shot .beams down as it began to come down lower. During this initial obser- vation the object was contin- ually changing color, green and red according to the witnesses. As it came lower it seemed to level off at about fifty feet above the tree tops, but it was still quite far away, perhaps a mile or even more. However, now it is only ten or fifteen degrees above the horizon as they look at it, and it is still more or less in a northeasterly direction. After perhaps one or two minutes it moves back up to about forty- five degrees. Then it begins moving toward the witnesses, be- coming larger. It appears to be emitting a light point like a beam toward the ground except the beam continually breaks up and never seems to touch the ground. As Rodney stated, \"It was like pouring out mercury; it beaded up and seemed to break up the beam and somehow join back together.\" At this point, Kim, who was the driver of the car, started the car and turned west on Darmstadt Road headed toward New Athens and Route #13. The object changed course and fol- lowed them,' moving parallel to their car and remaining about i mile distance from them. Now this object is definitely not like the initial object they saw. This object is very much of a pie-shaped object with a row of yellow lights around the bottom of the pie plate and a row of red lights around the edge of the pie plate, with the pie itself making up the entire top of the object as they des- cribed it. ANOTHER OBJECT As they neared the route #13 and the Darmstadt intersection the object appeared to stop and hover over a long cylinder ob- ject on the ground. They esti- mated this to be at least fifty feet long and perhaps five to seven feet in diameter. This cylinder had a pulsating orange light in the front half of it and a green light in the rear half. When they arrived at the Route #13 and Darmstadt Road intersection they turned on to Route #13, going northwest to Rodney's house. They lost sight of the object.  ' When they arrived at Rodney's house they were all in a very excitable state. There are several children in the family, and in their excitment some of the children awakened and the story was related to them, al- though Mrs. Walta evidently slept through this part of the excitement. During this period of time Rodney continued to insist in a very excitable state that he knew the object was coming over to the house. Very shortly they observed that some type of a light was illuminating the area around the house. They are not quite sure if this was an artificial light or if it was actually the light, of day; As the time was approximately five thirty a.m., it was not' getting light—of that I am certain. My guess is that it was an artificial light that was illuminating the area around the house. DOGS ACT STRANGELY In looking out the window, Rodney excitedly called Kim and Jeff to look at the dogs and their strange behavior. The dogs were lying on the ground as if mesmerized, with their tongues literly hanging out, making no movement or sound whatsoever. I might inject at this point that when , I was there on Sunday, Jan. 12, these dogs were continually barking, and I am told they are very vocal at any time anyone or anyth i ng'comes around. However, at this particular time in the early morning hours in question the dogs were doing nothing. At this time Rodney thought he heard noises on the roof of his house and possible noises down in the basement of his home that he ^somehow attribu- ted to the presence of this U. F.O. 'Neither of the other wit- Page 13"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"nesses could be certain that they heard these noises, but Rodney insisted he heard them. He was now in a state of ex- citement to the point of being hysterical. AN ELECTRIC SHOCK Suddenly, without any warn- ing, there was a tremendous electrical shock within the house that was of such force that little five-year-old Susie, who was in an occasional chair, was knocked . into the floor. .All of the children were up at this time,, I'm speaking of Kim, Rodney, Jeff, little Susie, and one other little fellow whose name es- capes me,, All of them felt this shock. At this time Rodney went to the window, pulled back the shade, and saw the bottom side of this U;F.O. slowly leaving the area from :above, the top of his house. It is- moving in a northerly direction as if it was following the railroad tracks that move along here running north and south. At this point Mrs. Walta was awakened and Rodney was in a hysterical state. She was try- ing to calm him down and find out what was going on. How the lady slept through the excite- ment as described by the wit- ness is inconceivable, but evi- dently she had. However, her concern for Rodney and the mental state he was in prompted her to call the doctor and make arrangements to take Rodney to see him and get something to calm him down,, She did take Rodney to the doctor about seven thirty or eight a.m. that morning. Rodney, in telling the doctor of his ex- perience, was asked by the doc- tor \"what he had been smoking,,\" AN ANALYSIS My own analysis of this par- ticular case based on two very lengthy interviews with these witnesses is that they.defin- .itely had two experiences as I have related. I cannot deter- mine in my own mind whether or not the incident as related happened after they returned to Rodney's home are actual facts or the working of an imagina- tion by some very excited teen- agers. There are some areas that do substantiate Rodney's claim of the incident at his house: 1. The condition of the dogs and the fact that they were not responding as they normally would. 2. The light that illuminat- ed the area outside of the house at five thirty a.m. .It could not have been the light of day that time of morning. 3. The electrical shock that was felt by five witnesses at this point, although Mrs. Walta did not feel it, or at least it did not waken her» These instances would cer- tainly indicate that there was more going on than just imagin- ation. However, it does perplex me that Rodney is the only one that seems to have heard the noises. Rodney is also the only one who says he saw the'U.F.0 0 as it was leaving, and the fact that the other witnesses are not absolutely sure of all of these happenings at the home leave me with a very question- able attitude about that phase of it. I think it is very important that we do not discount the highly excitable .state of the three witnesses at the time leaves me with a very question- .they arrived home and related their experience of the night to even younger children. UFOs escort Mexican pilot DATE OF SIGHTING: May 3, 1975 LOCATION OF SIGHTING: over Tequesquitengo Lake, Mexico SOURCE OF REPORT: United Press International SUBMITTED BY: Joe Brill, in- ternational coordinator .Carlos Antonio de los Santos Montiel has reported that three UFOs joined him as he was fly- ing his Piper Cub at 15,000 feet over Tequesquitengo Lake, about 50 miles south of Mexico City, on May 3. The 23-year-old flier said he was traveling at about 1^0 m.p.h. when he was joined by the objects. \"Two of them flew a few inches from each wing, and another below the plane,\" he said. \"I tried to lower the landing wheels to hit the one below, but the mechanism fail- ed.\" He said he then \"tried to hit the other two with the wings, but the controls did not respond.\" The pilot, said that at that moment his nerves broke and he burst into tears. He said his plane was \"pilot- ed by some strange force\" be- tween Tequesquitengo and Tlal- pan, a southern suburb of Mexi- co City, but that he was able to radio the control tower at the Mexico City airport. The objects left the Piper Cub at Tlalpan and moved to- wards two snow-capped volcanoes about 50 miles to the south. Two air traffic controllers, Julio Interian and Emilio Estanol, said they observed the incident on two separate radar screens at Benito Juarez Inter- national Airport. They said radar indicated \"an unidenti- fied object\" speeding along at the side of the Piper Cub. Interian said he \"observed the plane from the moment it was over Tequesquitengo until it landed. When it was above the Ajusco (a mountain on the edge of the Valley of Mexico) I noticed another mark on the screen move rapidly away from the plane.\" The two controllers said that it was at that moment when the pilot radioed that the UFOs had left him.

It was clearly seen at times that the object had a triangular shape, since occasionally an equilat- eral triangle was clearly pro- jected on the background of the sky, with some kind of internal luminous filling, and some sort of body slightly darker than the sides .of the .triangle could easily be distinguished in the center of the triangle. \"At times, the object assum- ed a position with respect to the ground wherein from' the side it resembled the shape of a hat and \"some sort of tail protruded, straight, like a pencil emanating from the cen- ter of the hat. This tail was projected straight downward and had a thickening on the end of it. This tail changed its po- sition together with .the hat; that is, it did not change its position relative to the hato The length of this tail was scarcely less than the height of the hat. \"The object gave off no sound that could be heard. My vision is very . good despite my old age. The object could be ob- served clearly without glasses even in a darkened place. .Therefore, I am transmitting exactly what I observed with my own eyes. \"The . entire population of the: village of Second Lesken observed this object for a long time. There are about 6,000 people and more than 550 house- holds in.this vi1lage. \"Before the sun . set, the color of the object was white, but as darkness set in the white gradually became reddish and then red. \"I quit watching the object when it began to move in a southeastern direction. I af- f i rm. that this : ;bbject was emit- .ting its own light.\" (Signed): A 0 G.

The entire population of Ruse watched this object for more than three hours, and it changed direction of movement twice. It's color was described as \"a silverish glow becoming purple toward the edges.\" This UFO was also observed over Pana- gyurishte, Bulgaria, the same day, accord- ing to the Peoples Observatory in Stara Zagora. I noticed that the UFO moved slowly. \"I remember that there was a telescope and camera in the school. The UFO hung in the west-southwest at an altitude of fifteen degrees, it moved approximately toward us. It could be seen with the naked eye that the UFO had a bright white color and a triangular shape—it was clearly visiVle in outline against the back- ground of the sky. The triangle seemed to be scalene with rounded corners. \"It appeared that the light of the .UFO shone with a blue light. The impression was form- ed that the body was transpar- ent or semi-transparent. Some kinds of lines could be seen inside the body. \"The UFO seemed to have a three-dimensional shape in the telescope,, It was noted with the naked eye that the UFO. ro- tated around an axis. In the telescope it was observed that the UFO rotated in.al1 direc- tions in a rather complex man- ner. When the sun was setting, the light of the UFO became reddish, and when the = sun had set the object became red. The impression remained, however, that it shone from within and the body was transparent. \"Some kind of vertical 'ca- ble 1 , protruding from the UFO was also seen in the telescope. This UFO was first sighted over Pristiha, Yugoslavia, at 1530 hrs. on Nov. 21, 1967. It was observed by hundreds of people in Leskovac, Vlasotinci, and Pristina, Yu- goslavia, between 1530 and 1630 hrs. The above photograph was taken at 1710 hrs. over Sofia, Bulgaria, where it was ob- served until 1735 hrs. It was observed by the entire population of Sofia. Its color was described as \"silverish-blue gradual- ly changing to orange and finally to red when it disappeared from view.\" (Photo has been retouched for better printing.) It was just a little shorter than the UFO. The first impres- sion was that it was an antenna with a thickening on the end. The vertical position of this 'cable 1 did not change. The body changed its direction of movement once during the obser- vation. At first it moved from southwest to east-northeast and then from west-southwest to southwest. When the body chang- ed its direction of movement, the luminescence changed from blue to red. At approximately. 1830 hours the UFO began to disappear as a regular non- luminous body would disappear. \"The outlines of the object were still clearly visible at the end of the observation, but they also, gradually went out. The object was illuminated ap- proximately uniformly unti1 it began to -disappear,, The lines within the 'triangle.' \" were not parall.el sides and they rotated together with the body.\" (Signed): 0.

Walton Beach has assured him that there have been no air tests run in the area at the time of the sightings, but that the base, located 300 miles north- west, has been unable to track any of the objects on radar. One of the sightings was .made at 2 a.m. April 21 by mem- bers of the James Townsend fam- ily of Ponce de.Leon, who went out to milk when they saw a bright object. Sheriff's dep- uties were called, and they said the object was \"flying in some sort of zigzag pattern\" and \"changing colors from red to green to amber to white.\" It appeared to be the size of a basketball, but the witnesses said they could not tell how high it was.

Va., along twisting route 88. With them in the car was a friend of the two girls. At the top of the hill over- looking West Liberty State Col- lege they all saw at once a black oval shape coming toward the college to their right in the distant sky. The time was immediately checked; it was 3:05 p.m., EST. A dull blue gray color washed an overcast sky, permitting the dark shape to be seen. It was larger than the apparent size of a typical airplane as seen from that distance. They thought a fist at arm's length would be about right (to be consistent, with later aspects of the sighting they should have suggested thumb nail size). There were 1 ights on the shape, described by one of the girls as window-like, although the others specified the im- pression of rim lights. Al- though not exactly seen as such, they had an image of a .circular disc with low dome on top. The lights would have been . around the interface of the dome and disc rim. The lights either turned on and off in sequence or the object was rotating. The carload of bewildered witnesses drove on past the college and into the village of West Liberty where they let off the girls' friend, who wanted nothing more to do with black oval lights. Rather than stop- ping at their own home, a spirit of adventure took hold and they drove on past West Liberty in search of the ob- ject. At the top of the next hill it could be seen in the far distance occasionally moving to the right and then back to the left. The girls tried, sending \"telepathic\" messages asking it to return and land. When the object did turn and begin com- ing back the girls' mother de- cided that it was time, indeed past time, to go quickly and safely home. After the quarter-mile ride home, the three came out of the garage and one of the girls said, \"Look mom, its directly above us!\" OVER THEIR HOUSE \"Mom\" did not really want to look up and see anything; she was frightened by now. But there was no escaping the fact that a huge, black, oval shape could be seen hovering over the house. When asked to think of some- thing in the house that when held at arm's length could dup- licate the apparent size and shape of the object, they thought first of a dish pan and then, even better, a tub. The thought that a fist at arm's length could have covered it up was greeted with laughter. By now the girls had run over to the bright street lamp in front of the house to wave up at the craft and to demon- strate their eagerness to have a landing occur. There was no indication of structure, only a black shape with lights around the rim— alternating white and red lights. Confusion exists over whether the lights blinked in sequence or the entire shape turned.. After the longest five seconds in history, the shape smoothly accelerated and moved again out past the distant hilltop where it seemed to be joined by two other lighted ob- jects (possibly airplanes at a greater d.istance). While overhead, a distinct humming sound could be heard coming from the shape. The sound was similar to that of a phonograph motor left running. ANALYSIS Only some preliminary thoughts at this time: Many airplanes fly over this area due to the presence of the Wheeling airport in the vicini- ty. During the course of the interview on the evening of Jan. 17, I had them identify every mysterious light in the sky that went by. All were properly and confidently iden- tified as ai rplanes. There are also regular heli- copter flights between Wheeling and Pittsburgh airports. This reported black shape was thought to be much lower than the typical helicopter flight, and hummed instead of making the usual heavy drone one ex- pects from helicopters. After this sighting, Dr. Hynek's book, \"THE UFO EXPER- IENCE, was checked out of the library by the witness for the purpose of finding out what to do if the shape were to return. Some terminology from the book seeped into the interview— words like \"mother ship\" and \"contactee.\" I believe these ideas have grown upon them after -the sighting and knowledge about other sightings became known to them. I judge the witnesses to be sincere, uninterested in publicity, and with no axes to grind. The sighting could perhaps be considered explained if it were to turn out that a blimp had been manuvering at low al- titude over West Liberty that night, an unlikely circum- stance.

Any critic, if he is trying to be constructive, must point out the positive as well as the negative, despite the well- established principle in the news media that good news is no news. MUFON is growing by leaps and bounds and our beleaguered edi^ tor has his hands full in sort- ing through materials of all kinds and degree of quality. He brings to bear a background in journalism 'that is a defin- ite asset to MUFON. SKYLOOK is changing and evolving into what I confidently predict will be the premier publication on UFOs. In this time of growth and change, we should be quick to support and s-l:bw. to criticize— except for constructive criti- cism. Th.e editorial qualifi- cations placed on the \"Stiisa'nge Journey\" story are welcome, and necessary if we wish to avoid being label led gul 1 i'ble land urn critical. The comparison cases are a good feature. Another comparison case to the Rhodesian \"strange journey\" occurred Oct.. 22, 1973, in Blackford County, IN. (Hartford City News-Times, 10/23/73). Two ^t-foot silvery creatures were seen cavorting on and alongside a highway t \"One thing that bothers Flatter (one of the witnesses) is the condition of the field they were-standing in» When he spotted the two strange beings, he could swear they were standing in either a freshly plowed or \\ disc(ed) field.\" As with the tropical foliage Page 20 seen by the witnesses in Rho- ' desian dry country,it is tempt-' ing to speculate that someone Is tajnperi.hg with bur space- time perceptions (or giving 1 the illusion thereof), but first, we must attend to the facts. Some of the skeptics also need to learn that facts come before theory, and poorly checked facts can lead to nonsense theories. One might question whether a spectacular and controversial case of this type should be reported so fully before more thorough investigation is ac- complished. In talks with col- leagues, ' I •• detect two schools of thought: (1) such cases should be reported . i,n outline, fol lowed--up and investigated as thoroughly' as possible, THEN reported in detail with invest^ igator's findings.; (2) ail ava liable deta i 1 s shpu Td be , published, then criticized, re- viewed, and put through a pro- cess pf refinement. Either view is .defensible, 'Two other welcome features in this issue are the follow-up detai'ls on the Spanish roadside occupant case and the correc- tion notes. No matter what approach is taken to reporting partially investigated cases, follow-up reports with new findings or details are important to UFO research. So are what may ap- pear to be picky criticisms of specific cases. One must chip away, doubting and questioning, to get at the underlying truth. Some garbling and error in- evitably gets introduced while processing large amounts of in- formation, and it may be by the reporter, editor, or typist.
