FROM THE EDITOR Certain areas of UFO research loom larger than others today. The following topics, in particular, need to be fully explored and doing this would constitute a worthwhile research program: (1) Evaluation of humanoid reports and reporters, witness credibility, report content credibility, cultural influences .(\"filters\"), psychological factors, etc. (2) Ways and means for collecting and studying physical evidence cases of all types (physical traces, E-M effects, phsyiological effects, etc.); kinds of appropriate laboratory analysis and tests on soil, foliage, animals, humans, and vehicles. (3) Radar, photographic, and other instrument cases: how best to analyze them and derive reliable information from them. (4) Historical research: gathering still-secret reports from credible witnesses so far unwilling to talk; prying loose important cases known to exist somewhere in U.S. Government files; studying the role of the CIA and others in suppressing information. (5) Methodologies: We need to know far more about the proper uses and limitations of such instruments and methods as computer photo-enhancement, polygraphs, psychological tests, psychological stress evaluators (PSE's), chemical analysis, and hypnosis. In addition to case reports and general news, the Journal will publish articles related to these five topics to encourage a coherent research program. We urge all staff members and contributors to focus on these areas of research.

In the course of the event, witnessed by a couple of high social status, a wrist-watch stopped for no apparent reason. After-a first report by Mrs. B., Ernst Berger conducted a field investigation on this case on July 18, 1978.. Gertrude B., 48, master hairdresser and chief of a fashionable saloon was sitting beside her husband Herbert, a realtor, 62. Leaving a private rifle range near Neurisshof -in the Vienna Basin, SW of Baden, Lower Austria, he steered the family Mercedes along a rough lane through open fields a little after 2200 hrs. GET. Night had fallen and the sky was overcast. Mrs. B. recalled: \"Suddenly ... there was an intense orange, disc behind the dark clouds, like one of my mirrors in the hairdresser's saloon. I told my husband: 'That's strange, look!' and he replied: 'It's the moon.' (in fact, the moon — one day before first quarter — set at 2306 GET, but the object became visible 30° up in the southwest - E.B.) 'Do we have full moon?' I asked him ... then noticed he slowed down the car considerably. I asked 'Why are you driving that slow?* and he recalled 'Because it's uncanny.' ... The orange disc, first partially hidden by clouds, seemed to twist, standing at a tilted angle like airplanes in a curve before approach... was blue-grey...a cold color and looked like a pot-lid how or, so to say, a disc with a center hump. ... Suddenly it changed again into two orange dots and disappeared on the spot...  \" I said:'Switch on the interior light, I must get the time of this' and he did so. It was 2215 GET... Driving home I kept both eyes on the sky, to no avail. . .When we arrived home, my watch had stopped, still showing 2215! ...I don't like to mention this, I'm not crazy, but it had .stopped at the time of the observation...and when I just turned the crown two times...as the watch was stiH almost fully wound-up, the hands moved and all was OK again.\" The watch was an expensive gold Longines (Swiss) lady wrist-watch. In my field investigation, the B's drew a sketch series of the event and gave more details. The observation lasted about 1 minute. First, a clear-cut, intense orange disc of 1.5° stood at 30° elevation between dark cloud strips which were not illuminated by the object, \"unlike the moon rays\" (sketch 1). Mrs. B. also compared the color to the light of sodium vapor high-pressure streetlights at the end of Southern Highway, Vienna. As the car moved ahead slowly, the elevation diminished to 10/12° with the same azimuth of about 250°, towards Southern Highway near Holies. Instantly, an \"ice-cold\" metallic blue-grey tint, was seen illuminating a domed disc (sketch 2). Shortly afterwards, the scene went dark except for two orange points of light (sketch 3) which disappeared \"as you switch off an electric light\", according to Mrs. B. The cloud base of an altocumulus field near Vienna at 2200 GET was reported to be 12,000 feet by the airport weather service. Therefore, taking into account the different sea levels and the 30° elevation, we can assume 6.5 kilometers slant range distance and 200 meters true diameter for the beginning of the observation, if the reported values are correct — an enormous size indeed. Tilt, color change, and \"switch- off are other typical patterns. The windows were closed and the car engine functioning normally, with no sound from the object: Further discussions on the affair ended with the comment of Mrs. B. that she often has had vivid precognitive dreams on minor accidents, etc. which were verified days later. Her husband does not take this seriously and puts it off as \"unbridled fantasy.\" A tank commander of World War H, he has .-been an enthusiastic hunter for years with good eyesight and corroborates most details given by his wife. Both are familiar with Austrian magazine and newspaper details of UFOs and reported the incident as a UFO, \"something we've never seen before.\" On July 21,1978, the freshly tape- recorded data was presented v for psychiatric analysis to Prof. Dr. O.A. of Vienna University, a renowned expert on psychopathological processes such as visual hallucinations. His comments can be summarized as follows: \"I do not personally know me subjects, but ... a change of one shape into another single one is rare in shaped visual hallucinations. ... Often, hallucinated forms are interpreted immediately in a symbolic way by patients — e.g. a triangle as Holy Trinity; abstract reporting is not very common. ;.. One has to observe that orange and blue are frequent natural colors of the sky, basic colors of the everyday optical stimuli.... This leaves an illusionary misinterpretation within reach. A circular disc is a normal shape in the sky, but not a tilted disc. ... \"Observations through a car windscreen contain other physical factors like chromatic diffraction,..but are not relevant for almost vertical lines of sight through the glass (as was the case in the B. incident • E.B.),,, and clear, non-shaded windscreens... (Visual) hallucinations are rather short and modified/intensified by the emotional stimulation: ...

The object first followed every manuever of the car through the south outskirts of the town, then paced the car at the highway and was finally lost over pine woods. A field investigation by Ernst Berger and Heinz Szabo on July 16 yielded the following tape- recorded data: Harald, 19, state railway engine fitter, and Josef, 16, an electrician, both normal-sighted, sober, and mentally stable residents of the Wiener Neustadt region, returned to their town, 40 kilometers south of Vienna in the Vienna Basin, in the last hour of Thursday from Pottendorf (see map). Harald was driving his Alfetta, an Italian Alfa Romeo sports car. Entering Wiener Neustadt (position 1 on map) Josef spotted a luminous object of more than full moon size stationary 40° right off the road heading, at about 10° elevation, the direction of airfield (Vienna Sightings, Continued) visual hallucination will last 10 to 15 seconds at maximum, but definitely less than a minute without motion. Developing hallucinatory episodes can last somewhat longer... The second part of the observation may contain subjective colorings, interpretations like the cupola typical for UFO reports and the lights suggesting \"take-off rockets\".... The primary experience speaks against a illusion/delusion as the persons involved have had no other hallucinations and were not under the influence of drugs or alcohol.\" The result is a psychiatrically- attested genuine UFO, the third in the Baden/Wiener Neustadt region of the Vienna Basin since mid-June 1978. Wiener Neustadt-East. It was strangely shaped (see sketch a), like a pale orange-red half moon with a ragged left contour and dark dots or spaces over the surface. Harald thought they were folds, and both took the thing for a balloon. The light shone steadily and seemed to illuminate only the object. No lateral displacement or rotation was noticed. Driving through the town south, then westwards, the object was not lost behind but remained visible for seconds to the right of the car. \"I had the impression it was moving with us, but didn't believe it,\" Josef recalls. Because he was not driving, he had the better look at everything that happened. At the outskirts, \"we stopped at an intersection.. waiting for the green light (position 2). I rolled down the side window and looked closer.\" The object was now a full orange globe (sketch b) with dark spots, sharply outlined, and had stopped at 300° azimuth and 5° elevation. \"Suddenly it moved across the road in front of us to the left side (az. 260°, el. 2°) and stopped again ... now we got it: That's a flying object!\" The UFO halted way over a firm rooftop, moving up and down, even disappearing behind the roof. \"When we got a green light and went left (now southbound), it started and kept at our right again... I got a peculiar feeling kind of being followed and Watched.\" The object stayed right of the vehicle, at low altitude so it was frequently lost for seconds behind trees or buildings. The Alfa Romeo reached another crossroad near a gravel pit (position 3) and stopped. So did the object. \"I told him (Harald) to go straight on to the pit, but he turned left, and when I looked right there was the object again\" flying southeast beside the car. \"It always kept its distance, though it was big, or maybe smaller and nearer.\" For slightly more than full moon size, a true diameter of 5 meters is equivalent to 500 m distance, for instance. Harald sped westwards over the Southern Highway approach road. The UFO kept its place. Southbound on the highway Josef still had the thing in sight"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"to the west over the Steinfeld pine forest. \"We picked up speed to over 150 kilometers/hour, but couldn't shake it off. It was there, at times higher, then lower, but still there.\" Turning into Neunkirchner Alley, a perfectly straight turnpike of 10 kilometers length, the Alfetta passed a gas station (position 4) \"and then I saw it in the left back window, looking back.\" It kept a position 130° left of the car heading, now and then obstructed by trees. \"Then, there was one of those clearings (position 5)...and I saw it suddenly trail a kind of a glow...in the same color, but fainter,\" which was described by Josef as a cone 2 or 3 times the globe diameter, fully merging with the contours of the main object (sketch c). Josef held the driver's wheel for Harald and shouted \"Look at this!\", but seconds later the light cone was gone. At St. Egyden they turned the car left onto a road through the pine forest. Josef caught glimpses of the globe more distant at 130° left, 5/10° elevation (position 6) through the passing stems. Then he lost it from sight. Apparently it remained in a low position over the pine woods. Heading back to Wiener Neustadt on Federal road 54, Josef sighted the globe again at the same elevation, 90° left of the road after the branch-off to Fbhrenau (position 7). \"It looked smaller—then moved off into the distance (to the north - E.B.) (position 8) and we lost it... I searched the sky all the way home; but it was gone.\" \" Somewhat disturbed, the two young men entered Wiener Neustadt after their 20-25 minute drive. July 13 was a 'fair summer night with few clouds. Subsequent calls revealed the Wiener Neustadt region had had no civil or military flight activity of any kind at the reported late hour; Although there have been no corroborating reports on the object forthcoming from the area so far, the boys' testimony given during a field investigation drive along the original route was honest and colorful. The incomplete globe shape, color and dark dots of the early sighting phase remind us strongly of the Vienna police report on a similar object in north Vienna on February 27, 1977 (see \"Policemen watch UFO\", MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 112, March 1977; page 17): That object also had peculiar Austrian car paced by ITFO, sketch Sketch Series of Object by Josef UFO sighted by local family A Morgan Hill family of four had an unexpected encounter Monday nighl on the way to church, they sighted a UFO while traveling along Highway 280 in the San Jose area.

Niemtzow, M.D. (MUFON Consultant and Former APRO French Representative) and John F. Schuessler (MUFON Deputy Director, Administration) The Houston based Vehicle Internal Systems Investigative Team (VISIT) has focused its efforts on the scientific study of UFO internal engineering systems. This study requires the analysis of the obvious clues and full consideration of the secondary effects so often noted. One such effect is the paralysis of witnesses in close encounter cases. Witness paralysis has been well described in the UFO literature. For example, Vallee, in Passport to Magonia, identifies a number of such cases. On June 19, 1951, Joseph Matiszewski of Sonderborg, Denmark, saw a UFO land in a meadow. When he approached within 50 m he found himself paralyzed. Mr. Mercier of Bouzais, France, found himself paralyzed on September 28, 1954, when a luminous mass landed 50 m away and three figures emerged. Messers. Gallois and Vigneron, also of France, saw a craft only 50 m away in a pasture on October 11,1954, and were paralyzed until the craft left. On October 21,1954, a young man walking in a field near Melito, Italy, saw a craft land and found himself paralyzed. In a similar incident near Scotia, Nebraska, on November 5,1957, a man watched a balloonlike craft that came down to ground level. He too was paralyzed. Significantly, many of the victims despite the loss of motor functions in the upper and lower extremities do not fall, and death has been rarely reported. Because of the selective paralysis of some body functions and the pathological absence involving the autonomic nervous system, Niemtzow has suggested elsewhere (APRO, March 1975) that the clinical manifestations and paralytic pathways avoid the vital functions of the organism and that nerve trunk diameter seems the differentiating consideration of the paralytic process. This process seems to involve the large diameter nerves used in muscle innervation rather than the smaller fibers associated with autonomic regulation essential to the maintenance of life. It is not unknown in ufology that accompanying the human paralysis are other physical manifestations which may be related to E-M effects. The car motor that fails, the extinction of electrical and radio systems, and the silencing* of animals and insects are all well known to the reader. That this E-M process may be the culprit of untoward effects on the victim is not surprising. However, it is an essential consideration that the resulting clinical signs must not be confused with ionizing radiation effects which may mimic E-M biological effects of extremely low frequencies. Perhaps it is very naive to suggest a physical mechanism involving such a poorly understood phenomenon; nevertheless, it becomes quite suggestive. Schwann, 1957, and Hasted, 1973, propose that the human cell membrane having such a high dielectric constant and low conductivity does not permit current to enter through the cell membrane; instead, it is bypassed through electrolytic components of interstitial fluid. It is thus possible to calculate the actual current density in the interior of cells within tissue and to ascertain the intensity of an external electric field to cause dangerous cellular damage. We find according to Schwann, 1972, that an external electric field of 5 x 10 8 volts/meter is necessary to cause a change of 1 mv in cellular membrane potential. From these considerations Schwann states that it is virtually impossible to evoke dangerous current densities in the human body by external low frequency fields. Unfortunately, the authors do not believe that a 1 mv change in membrane potential is significant to normal physiological situations. The electrokinetic properties of cells are such that certain compensating mechanisms exist and slight variations in intracellular and trans membrane potentials are physiological. More related to the UFO problem is the consideration of magnetic fields. Unlike the situation with electric fields, the external magnetic field is not attenuated by the body. All portions of the body have the same magnetic permeability as free space. AC magnetic fields can induce currents that will flow in closed circuits within the body. It can be calculated that a 1 g, 60 hz magnetic field induces a 2 mv/m electric field in a a circuit radius of 0.1 meter, composed of material having the same resistivity as body tissue. This internal field produces a current density that is comparable to that produced by a 2.5 kv external electric field. Thus the magnetic field can induce greater electrical currents in the human body than comparable external electric fields. Interestingly enough, microwave effects on the large motor nerves causing a propagated electrical spike in afferent and efferent directions along the axon can block physiological action potentials and thus be capable of inhibiting muscular movement (McCampbell: Ufology, 1973). Concerning UFO paralysis, it may be possible to hinder the action potential of a nerve without producing tetanization and effectively achieve a state of immobility. The autonomic nervous system may be placed in a quasi balanced state during this phenomenon. It should not be admitted that paralysis may be aimed at the motor center of the brain.

Within the field of UFO study, our organization has focused its efforts on the scientific and engineering study of the internal systems of Unidentifed Space Vehicles (USV) and of the physiology of the beings which occupy these vehicles. Scientific and engineering data is obtained from (1) transcripts of conversations between psychologists or case investigators and the UFO abductees, (2) followup conversations with the abductees, (3) abductee critique of mockups of USV interiors built by VISIT, (4) physical evidence resulting from the contact (including medical evidence), and (5) physical evidence at the location of the encounter. The objectives of this research are to (1) determine if there is a correlation of scientific and engineering data from case to case, (2) identify internal systems which are most prevalent, (3) evaluate the purpose for these sytems, (4) determine how these systems operate, and (5) share the information obtained with the public at large. To date VISIT has cataloged 40 abduction cases. Of 18 cases for which information is available, 15 indicate that medical examinations were performed on the abductee. Similarily, of 19 cases, 15 indicated the presence of some sort of light beam and of 18 cases, 15 indicated medical aftereffects. Of 17 cases, 15 have some sort of description of the internal systems of the spacecraft. VISIT has comprised a list of questions which will aid the investigator of abduction cases. The questions deal in detail with the space vehicle engineering systems, medical examination and instruments used, physiology of the beings, and the physiological aftereffects of the abductee. A copy of the questionnaire can be obtained by qualified investigators by writing to VISIT. Our organization cannot achieve its goals without the cooperation of the expert investigators in the field. In return for case information, we will provide the investigator with a scientific and engineering critique of the data obtained in the case as well as provide the expanding findings of our research. Although we hold all particular case information strictly confidential, it is our objective to provide the general results of our research to educational institutions, government agencies, doctors, scientists, other specialized experts, responsible. UFO organi- zations, news media, and the general public. The interchange will be accomplished through letters, quarterly public meetings, articles in scientific journals, television and radio presentations, written articles in UFO organization's journals, and by participating in symposiums. VISIT will host the 1980 MUFON UFO SYMPOSIUM to be held at the University of Houston at Clear Lake City near the Johnson Space Center. The subject of this symposium will relate to scientific and engineering findings of abduction cases. The date will be announced in THE MUFON UFO JOURNAL when it has been firmed up.

(Paralysis, Continued) E-M on the brain with animals is poorly studied and any hypothetical correlation of ,UFO paralysis phenomenon would be beyond the scope of this paper. The untoward effects of E-M radiation reported by Asanova and Rakov (1966) on clinical studies of 45 employees of a Soviet 400-500 kv substation suggests similar hematological findings that one may find with low level ionizing radiation. It appears that E-M fields may indeed be responsible for what ufologists have thought to be \"radiation sickness\"; emphasizing the fact that E-M and not atomic radiation is associated with the UFO phenomena. The E-M field effect noted herein may be studied in the laboratory with animals to provide additional clues to identify the UFO systems involved. The long range gain from such study would be twofold; to permit modeling of the systems themselves, and, unfortun- ately, for use as a weapon in the control of human behavior. 7"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"CASE WITHHUMANOIDSATRIEC-SUR-BELON (Finistere) September 29, 1974\" (From Lumieres dans la Nuit No. 145, May 1975, pp 6-8. HumCat Case No. 1361.) In a letter full of sincerity Mme. Le Bihan, 46, told us of the extraordinary events which, with her husband and son, she had witnessed, and asked us to send a LDLN investigator to whom she could tell the story in full, This article summarizes that visit, which was made with the cooperation of the Pont-Aven gendarmerie brigade, more especially of brigadier Rampt, whose perfect cooperation M. Brochard wishes to acknowledge. Riec-sur-Belon (Michelin map 58, fold 16), near Pont-Aven, is a community of southern Finistere, with 1,233 houses and 4,400 inhabitants. On Sunday, September 29, 1974, it was 0045 in the morning when M. and Mme. Le Bihan were brusquely awakened by their son Younic Le Bihan, 20, a sergeant in the Air Force, returning from an evening out, who came into their bedroom to ask them to come into his room, taking care not to turn on any lights. (Mme. Le Bihan tells us she believed the house was on fire from the way her son \"irrupted\" into their bedroom.) They could then contemplate, from the second-floor window, oriented S-SE, a spectacle of rare beauty... M. Le Bihan, 46, a merchant seaman, made the following reflection: \"One would have said it was a steamboat lighted up in the middle of a prairie...\" The object, some 500 m away as the crow flies, appeared to them through binoculars as a hemisphere whose upper portion resembled at all levels a \"furnace\" with vaporous, indefinite outlines. In its center, some 8 Investigation by MM. J.-L. Brochard (LDLN Delegate) and Pascal Gireaudot sort of portholes emitting a very bright light of a very beautiful color, but rather difficult to define, resembling both orange and green. At what seemed to them to be the base of the object, on each side, was a light \"twice the size of a car's headlight,\" of a very vivid red, its color resembling that of a car's \"stoplights,\" circular, but also with vaporous and unclear contours. No foot was perceived, and they even thought that the object might be resting on a cushion of air, for it seemed to vibrate, oscillating from right to left. Perhaps it was rotating, but the witnesses could not say so with certitude. It is certain, though, that the object was not touching the ground; it was about 60 cm above it. It appeared to be of large dimensions: 10 m wide and 7 m high. At no time did it move: the witnesses saw it at all times opposite them. All at once, there was only darkness there, where a fraction of a second earlier there had been the luminous object. M. and Mme. Le Bihan could see, high in the sky, a yellow- luminous point that disappeared at high speed. It was at this moment that Younic perceived three \"beings,\" and passed the binoculars to his mother, asking her what she saw. Three \"humanoid\" appear- ances, fairly tall, perhaps 1.7 meters, of great corpulence — Mme. Le Bihan compares them to the Michelin \"tire man\" — were moving rather heavily, rocking from side to side — exactly the way the astronauts walked on the moon. No detail was visible; they were enveloped by suits of the color of molten metal — or of aluminum foil — but not dazzling. Their heads were round, but no detail of their faces was visible. They wore no headgear. Suddenly, the three \"beings\" changed their direction and came straight at the witnesses, in V formation — one in front in the middle, with the other two on each side — the same arrangement as on the cover of LDLN #132. They seemed to fly above the ground, traversing all obstacles. Panic-stricken, the witnesses cried out: \"they have spotted us...they're going to irradiate us...we must evacuate the house...\" It was done at once: they left their house to seek refuge with their mother, living farther up the street. They kept looking back, expecting at every moment to see the \"beings.\" Mme. Le Bihan was so terrified that after a few moments she stopped in the middle of the street, incapable of taking another step, crying to her husband and her son to flee, to abandon her, that she was sacrificing herself so that they could flee, and so that there would be someone left to tell the authorities of the nightmare they had experienced. Returning, M. Le Bihan and his son carried Mme. Le Bihan, but, puffing, they put her down at their nearest nieghbor's, a retired gendarme's. These neighbors told us that the witnesses were \"green,\" their faces deformed by terror. They spent the night there. M. and Mme. Le Bihan have a dog, Fox, who howled dreadfully before the event, and continued to do so throughout their desperate flight.

Curiously, the elements had calmed completely at the time of the observation: wind practically none, sky overcast, temperature relatively mild. Mme. Le Bihan observed that her clock, which had been normally wound up that evening, stopped at precisely the time of the observation, though it was going normally the next morning. No observation concerning watches. The presumed place of the landing, searched by gendarmes, showed no traces. The soil was particularly full of water from the rains that had fallen in the last few days. No geological fault in the area. (The map at 1:1 million shows the great complex which begins near Nantes up to the point of Le Raz, of which one southern fault passes S of Quimperle, 1.5 km to the north of Pont-Aven, and approximately 2 km from Riec-sur- Belon.) Two power lines, of low and high tension, above the presumed place of landing. Physically and mentally, Mme. Le Bihan remained greatly shocked for 3 days after the observation. She had insomnia, headaches, the feeling of having the brain wrapped in cotton, and felt pricklings all over her body, as if from needles. This prickling sensation disappeared as suddenly as it had come, several days later. Apart from these sequelae, Mme. Le Bihan lost 12 kg in weight. M. Le Bihan, like his son, cannot free himself from this vision in spite of the time that has passed: they too are still somewhat shocked. A \"complement\" to the investigation will be furnished by M. Brochard. The difference between the sketches of Younic and his mother will be noted. Younic draws a structure such as his father describes. M. Brochard furnishes no explanation for these differences. It seems, judging by the drawings, that there were several phases. At the beginning of the observation it was a question of luminous masses, the form seems not to have become precise until later. Then Mme. Le Bihan took the binoculars given her by her son... Was the mise au point properly done?..; Has Mme. Le Bihan properly reproduced what she saw?... Did the object become modified meanwhile, and is this the aspect that it subsequently took on?... These are details of a certain interest, but which bring no new element to the reality of the observation, and the presence of an object which traumatized the three witnesses. Complement: Declaration of Younic Le Bihan On Sunday, September 29, 1974, about 0045,1 was coming back to my house. I had just escorted Mile. Maryvonne Cadic home. When I arrived at the door of my property, there was a very intense shower going on. I went in and went to the kitchen to take some refreshment. While I was in the kitchen there was a violent thunderclap. The noise got louder up to a burst which appeared to me very near. This lasted about 30 seconds. I opened the living-room door at the moment when the sound ceased. It was about 0050. After making one or two steps I perceived a fugitive light of yellow-orange color. I thought of the lights of a nearby house... It took me about 10 seconds to go up to my bedroom. As I entered the room, I immediately perceived a red- colored halo through the window. I thought of a fire.:. Without turning on the light, I put down my jacket and went to the window. I perceived, at a place that I cannot specify but which seemed to me to be near the \"la Villeneuve\" crossroads, 500-600 m away as the crow flies, a big fire the size of a house. I was still thinking of a fire in one of the nearby farms. I went back to put the light on, then Itook my binoculars. What I saw at first was three rectangles of bright red light, like \"trap-doors\" above which were doors that could be raised or shut down. Almost simultaneously I saw passing, well below these trapdoors, three luminous masses of phosphores- cent white, without definite contours, but of about the size and form of a sheep. These three masses suddenly appeared, and disappeared toward the left, making an arc as if going around something. Examining the red rectangles, I clearly made out a form. It was a sort of horizontal pedestal about 1 meter high, sloping at its left end, surmounted at its middle by a sort of cabin in the form of a truncated cone, about 4 m high, which surrounded the three red rectangles. The contours were sharply defined by straight lines. Only the base of the pedestaj was invisible. The whole thing was of a gray color, seen against the darkness of night. The engin, stationary in position, appeared to be held in suspension and seemed to vibrate. I could, only see part of the object: the right-hand portion was masked by an obstacle which I cannot specify, probably a hedge or a screen of trees. The countryside around it was not illuminated; I could not see it. To examine the nearer ground, I lowered my binoculars slightly and I then saw, in front of the.engin, in my direction, silhouettes having the appearance of human beings. They were of the same color as the three luminous masses seen at first, the color of an electric arc. They seemed to be the size of a human being, about 1.7 meters. They were of stocky build, the head proportional to the body, and I could clearly distinguish the legs. I then went downstairs rapidly to wake my parents on the ground floor. I said to them \"Come quickly, but above all don't turn on any lights,\" without specifying to them the object of my intervention. They came upstairs right after me. This took me a minute or a minute and a half. On arriving in my bedroom, my parents took the binoculars. I was observing with the naked eye and I saw (continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":",eiool(liIunianoId8^G;ontinued) only the \"fire\" I had seen at first. On the other -hand, I clearly saw three silhouettes such as I have already described. They were in a \"V\" formation, i.e., one ahead and 2 slightly behind at the sides. They were moving in our direction. I took back the glasses and I could see them distinctly; their walk was slow and heavy, but they seemed nevertheless to progress at the speed of a person who walks quickly. With their slow and heavy gait went a slow rocking back and forth: their movements were perfectly synchro- nized. They did not seem to make contact with the ground, but it seemed that they nevertheless had something to stand on. I could make out no features of the face, and I did not see \"superior members\" (arms.) I lifted my glasses slightly, to look at the engin and judge the distance which separated it from the silhouettes. At that moment it seemed to make a slight lateral somersault, then suddenly disappeared. I had a slight recoil and, instantly, my eyes perceived a red-orange light, very fugitive, to my right and very high in the sky, a sort of flash. The three silhouettes were still on the ground, in the same position, and still advancing upon us... It was at that moment that, fearing we had been spotted, I decided . to leave the house, and urged my parents to do the same. We took refuge with M. Cadic, about 300 m from our house. I took my dog along. During our walk, I turned around several times, but saw nothing. My view of the apparition had lasted 3 to 4 minutes. The night was very dark, the sky overcast, the stars and the moon could not be seen. The engfn, taking into account its hidden portion, may have had a length of 9 to 10 meters. During the whole duration of the phenomenon, I perceived no noise or sound. I felt no effect, either immediately or later, of any kind. When we took our dog, he showed no reaction. Oh the other hand, when we went back, about an hour later, he continually moaned as we approached the house. I noticed nothing else abnormal in his behavior. The silhouettes appeared to be dressed in head-to-foot suits. 1 am certain that I saw an \"object,\" and that the \"personages\" were real. It cannot be a question of a natural phenomenon due to the thunderstorm or to some other cause, but certainly of an \"engin\" having well-defined contours and proportions. Investigation carried out by: MM. Jean-Louis Brochard (regional delegate) — Pascal Gireaudot (Investigator 56.) Complementary Investigation at Riec-Sur-Belon (Finistere) by M. J.-L. Brochard (From Lumieres dans la Nuit, No. 146 , (June/July 1975). pp. 16f.) Witnesses: Mme. Marie-Francoise Duigou (26), M. Alexandre Duigou (36). Address: Le Bel-Air, 29124 Riec-sur- Belon. Profession: Monsieur: Fish warden of Waters and Forests. Madame: No profession. Date: Night of Saturday, Sept. 28, 1974, about 0045-0100 on Sunday morning. Account Between 0045 and 0100 th?' night, M. and Mme. Duigou had gor > to bed, when the.y were suddenly awakened by a very \"dry\" noise (a little like the sonic \"bang\" of an aircraft) very close to them, in the direction of Moelan, which shook the windows of the house. M.Duigou thought of a thunderstorm, and decided to get up to unplug the TV set, as he usually does in storms. He tried to light the light, but it was not working... At this moment, an impression of extreme heat made itself felt in their bedroom, and M. and Mme. Duigou had the stupefaction of seeing that an intense light, comparable to that of neon, was filtering into their room through the closed shutters. This window opens to the SSE. The electricity came back on about 5 minutes after M. Duigou had tried to light his lamp. Unfortunately, M. Duigou did not have the idea of opening his shutters to look for the origin of this intense neon light. Two weeks passed, then M. Duigou noticed, looking out his bedroom window, on the second floor of his house, three rectangular traces of 60 x 90 cm, where the grass was completely burned...in the lawn belonging to the house. M. Duigou then went down to look more closely at these traces (he had meanwhile heard of the Le Bihan observation) and observed that in these three rectangles the grass was nonexistent, burnt, but not by a flame, for the ground was not blackened as a burning by fire would have made it, but scorched, as if by some chemical product...(here, too, M. Duigou did not have the idea of telling the police.) The grass did not grow again until recently* but one of these traces still remains very visible; the two others, though much effaced, nevertheless remain visible, when seen from the second-floor bedroom window. These three traces in a triangle, of which I enclose a photograph and a drawing, are they connected with the observation of the Le Bihan family? Several facts make all this very disturbing... (1) The house of these witnesses is situated on the exact axis of the bedroom window of M. Younic Le Bihan... (2) It is also situated less than 50 m from the crossroads of la Villeneuve... (3) We have searched in vain with M. Younic Le Bihan for the \"mask\" which prevented him from seeing the right-hand part of the object, and we found nothing to correspond with it in the presumed zone of the landing (i.e., 10"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"in the fields adjacent to the la Villeneuve crossroads.)--. Now, from the garden where the traces were found, a house, about 100 m from the Duigou house (between the Le Bihari house and theirs), corresponds perfectly to this \"mask\"... (4) The heat felt by the witnesses and that intense neon light, while the sky was very dark that night... To conclude, I will say that M. and Mme. Duigou appeared to me sincere in their declarations. Nevertheless, certain points seemed nebulous to me and after mentioning it to them, they told me that they had not thought that their observation had any great value, thinking even that it was, all in all, too insignificantly to justify a deposition to the police... However, Mme. Duigou spoke of it to Mme. Le Bihan, who told it to the police. P.S.: I was able to take several photos that I will send you as soon as they are developed, with their negatives. I also have some corrections to make in my report \"Mme. Le Bihan\": to wit, that their dog, as well as the neighbors', howled like mad 5 to 10 minutes before the observation and not during the observation... Also, the Le Bihan family did not pass the night with M. and Mme. Cadic, as I thought before, but only a few hours, then they went back home.

Schuessler According to recent Gallup Polls more people are accepting the reality of UFOs and more individuals have had a UFO experience. Often the witnesses are experienced observers such as pilots and law enforcement .officers, while many others are of the untrained variety. Nevertheless, the eyewitness testimony reveals a continuing pattern of unexplainable events. Critics are quick to point out that -the subjective phenomena of vision depends on the brain as much as the retina of the eye — much depends on what we think we see. This is supposed to mean that if we see a UFO it is because we wanted to see a UFO; therefore, the eyewitness testimony is of \"little value/Such thinking is pure hogwash. In a fairly recent meteorite case in Texas, witnesses were spread over hundreds of square miles. The incident took place at night and lasted only seconds. Even so, the eyewitness reports were so good and so consistent that researchers were able.to recreate the event and determine the path of the object. Admittedly, this was an uncontrolled event, but with highly satisfactory results. Results of the U.S. Army PROJECT SKYFIRE study of attempts to improve visual detection through use of search patterns and optical aids showed a similar success with visual .observations. In the February 1973 HumRRO Report No. TR-73-3, a \"summary of research being conducted to ascertain the visual skills of operators of low-altitude air defense weapon systems, a remarkable .consistency in eyewitness reporting was shown. This was in no way a UFO- related project, but the results are applicable. In 2,500 samples an F4C Phantom jet aircraft was detected at a range of 12,000 meters, with little 12 variance in the data. The conclusion of the study is as follows: \"The most general conclusion that can be drawn on the basis of research reported here is that the greatest facilitator of visual detection is a pair of 'sharp' eyes. Although it cannot be categorically concluded that optical aids and systematic search patterns do not have beneficial effects upon detection time, the studies reported here certainly indicate that it is not easy to .improve unaided visual detection through either optical assists or training in systematic methods of searching for small targets. Rather, it would appear that fundamental characteristics of vision such as visual acuity and, possibly, the field of view are the major sources of variance in determining the time required to acquire visual targets.\" The interesting point in all this is that the F4C aircraft used in the study is of the same size as the typical disc- shaped UFO — about 35-40 feet wide, and the detection .distance was repeatedly in excess of 7 miles. Visual .detection is very important in this life or death situation, so why shouldn't it be equally important to the UFO researcher?,,, I 1978 MUFON SYMPOSIUM PROCEEDINGS (131 Pages) A SURVEY OF CEIII REPORTS FOR .1977 'by Ted Bloecher, .New York.

Fawcett MUFON of North Carolina held its second annual training conference in Winston Salem on Saturday, June 17, and Sunday, June 18,1978. This year's conference, hosted again by officers and members of the Tar Heel UFO Study Group of Winston Salem, was chaired by Raymond C. Rhein, a MUFON Field Investigator and retired engineer from Pfaffton, Henry Morton, Also a MUFON Field Investigator and electronic researcher from Wadesboro served as Mastcr-of-Ceremonies for the 2-day conference. Newspaper coverage prior to the conference arid a UPI newswire follow-up story after the conference reached an even larger audience. Almost 50 investigators, researchers, members, and guests of MUFON-NC were present from Winston Salem, -. Wadesboro, Lewisville, Lumberton, Moyock, Lexington, Lincolnton, Eden, Boone, Pfaffton, Greensboro, Statesville, Germanton, Matthews, Clemmons, and Jamestown. The consensus of those present was that new personnel and funding should be made available for future UFO investigations, but it was hoped that this could come from the private sector rather than from the government. It was felt that APRO, MUFON, CUFOS, and NICAP should be part of such a new undertaking in the UFO field. The MUFON-NC 1978 conference was open to card-carrying members of the above-mentioned groups.' Dr. Dan Duke, MUFON member and a psychology professor at Appalachian State University in Boone, was the opening conference speaker. Duke's topic the \"Highlights of a UFO Weekend at ASU,\" covered lectures and debates on UFOs given by non- skeptic George D. Fawcett and skeptic Robert Sheaffer on the ASU campus. Dr. Duke said, 'To my knowledge it 14 was the first college or university in North Carolina to have opposing viewpoints on the UFO enigma debated oh its campus.\" Duke stated that he felt that all viewpoints, both pro and con in our quest for UFO truth, should be . heard and that this would lead to a better understanding of the UFO phenomenon. Wayne P. Laporte, a facilities industrial engineer who serves as the MUFON State Section Director for Mecklenburg, Cabarrus, Gaston, and Union Counties spoke on \"UFOs Mimic IFOs,\" covering his investigations of cases where UFOs may have posed as such commonly reported IFOs as airplanes, helicopters, clouds, etc. Dr. Duke also gave an excellent presentation on the \"Tungus Mystery.\" This topic concerned the possible extraterrestrial vehicle that entered the earth's atmosphere, made a trajectory change, and then exploded in Siberia in 1908. The event resulted in considerable scientific investigation and speculation as to the nature of its origin. Dr. Duke used maps and drawings to detail some of the current and older investigations. Greg Cooke, a young member of the Tar Heel UFO Study Group, then showed the MUFON slide-tape presentation entitled \"UFOs: A Problem for Science.\" This proved to be a valuable visual tool for training MUFON members and their guests and fellow investigators on the multiple implications of UFOs and the inherent need for scientists of all disciplines to face the UFO challenge head-on with all the facilities at their disposal. After a supper break at the nearby Morrison's Restaurant at the Hanes Mall Shopping Center, the group convened for the evening program and heard two taped interview cassettes presented by George D. Fawcett of Lincolnton. Posterboard illustrations of the eyewitnesses' original drawings were used with the cassettes. The first interviews covered the multiple experiences with UFOs over a period of time from 1954-1977, which were reported by Bob Brannigan, a WPNC radio announcer from Plymouth, N.C. Brannigan suffered injuries when a UFO forced his car off the road in 1977 and four out of five encounters involved half-globe shaped UFOs, lime-green in color, that gave off sulphur-like smells and caused both physiological and electromagnetic effects. A taped interview with pilot Floyd P. Hallstrom near Santa Monica, California in broad daylight on January 1, 1978, proved to be another interesting case. The air-to-air encounter involved a dome-topped UFO and Hallstrom's detailed report drew lively audience interest and response. (See No. 122, January 1978.) Later in the program, Fawcett presented illustrations drawn by three out of four witnesses to a close encounter of a \"dome-topped UFO with windows and landing gears\" that was reported by Mrs. Bruce (Jeanette) Stewart, (31), her daughter Holly (8), her son Robert (10), and a neighbor Mrs. Joseph McDonald (67). The incident occurred in Belvidere, New Jersey, on May 5, 1966. The drawings by the witnesses, who drew their sketches in separate rooms, turned out to be almost carbon copies of each other, despite the age differences of the witnesses. Wayne Laporte then gave a report titled \"CEIIK Landing\" on his personal investigation of a UFO landing in Charlotte, N.C., on March 5,1978, also involving multiple witnesses. The witnesses.(names on file) reported the landing of a dome-topped UFO with tripods between two trees spaced 10 feet apart. The UFO had green, yellow,"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"red and blue lights on it. As evidences of the visitation, the landing gears formed an isosceles triangle with markings on the ground 8 feet by 8 feet by 6 feet. The grass at the landing site was killed and the soil was left sterile, and luminescence increases were detected. The case is still under investigation. Nolie Bell, president of the Tar Heel UFO Study Group and the MUFON State Section Director for Davidson, Rockingham, Guilford and Randolph Counties, presented a talk on \"An Unusual Nocturnal Light,\" covering a case of a nocturnal meandering light that had puzzled area residents for months. Upon close investigation by Bell and other MUFON investigators, the UFO was determined to have resulted from afterburners on jet planes as they turned to make a final landing approach at the area airport. Jayne Ware, with her father, the late E. Z. Jones, State Civil Defense Director of North Carolina, investigated the near landing of a UFO, complete with an \"occupant\" in Red Springs, N.C., in December, 1951. Jayne, now a resident of Advance, N.C., related how the UFO returned to the same area that dusk, after having appeared earlier in the day leaving a burn mark on the ground near the farmhouse. The UFO with its 'pilot' had been observed earlier in the day by various members of the Sam Coley family. On its return visit the \"occupant\" was not seen, but the UFO was viewed at low altitude by Jayne, her father, two policemen, two of the Coley family children, and Mr. and Mrs. Sam Coley. During its close approach to the farmhouse ' the observers smelled something like burned electric wiring (ozone?), arid the droning sound it made seemed to cause their heads and internal organs to vibrate. Mrs. Ware's talk entitled \"CEII, Psychological and Physiological Aftermath,\" told of the effects of the UFO during and after the incident. She reported that she suffered from skin burns, scars, headaches, nausea, eye disorders, etc. The UFO was estimated to be about 30 feet in diameter and changed from a dull to bright orange and red color. Estimation of the duration of the encounter ranged from 5 to 10 minutes. The Sunday afternoon session opened at 1 PM with a 40-minute session on \"Astronomy for UFOlogists\", part of a training program directed by Nolie Bell. It proved to be a highly interesting and informative presentation and resulted in a lively question-answer period. One of the highlights of the conference was presented by Dr. Tag Guiton, school administrator of the Guilford Technical Institute at Jamestown, N.C. Dr. Guiton, a certified hypnotist, spoke on \"Hypnotic Regression: A Special Tool.\" Dr. Guiton said that the process of hypnotic regression can be used as a tool for memory recall, but that it must be used carefully with the view not on just truth for truth's sake, but for the purpose of relieving the subject through therapy. \"Encountering UFOs can be a traumatic experience - for the eyewitnesses, but the true professional should ask himself before proceeding with any case, what right do 1 have to add to the trauma?,\" Dr. Guiton emphasized. The conference closed with a variety of exhibits and demonstrations. The closing remarks were given by George Fawcett, who mentioned that MUFON now has representatives in over 60 of 120 counties in the Tar Heel state. Fawcett urged MUFON members to recommend qualified persons in the areas not already blanketed by the organization's network for various MUFON positions. Fawcett said, \"UFOs lead to a study of mankind and the spiritual, military, scientific, and academic implications of UFOs are ones we must continue to probe.\" MUFON 1030LDTOWNERD.

My advice right away is to buy them both, but if you think that two books will tell you more than you want to know on the subject, here are some points you might want to consider in making your choice. Both books assume the premise that no fraud was involved; they present what might be called the WaltorVAPRO version of the story, and they present it persuasively. The Walton Experience is, of course, a personal testimonial and would be interesting for that reason alone, but it has more than that in its favor. Not ghost-written, it bears out what I have heard about Walton from people who know him, that, far from being the hayseed type, he is a quiet but articulate young man with a sharp mind. He tells his story clearly and matter of factly, actually with less \"gee-whiz\" than Barry employs. In addition to his advantage of being able to write in the first person, Walton also had access to pictures which give graphic dimension to his book. He has photographs of all the crew members, plus local law officers, national investigators, and even the old boardsided truck that the crew was driving in the forest. The poor quality of some of the photographs is compensated for by full-color reproductions of the paintings by crew boss. Michael Paine, done from Walton's description of the interior of the craft and its occupants. In Bill Barry's book, instead of the personal point of view we .have the broader perspective of a competent journalist with a good background knowledge of the UFO phenomenon. He tells the same story of the CE III and 16 its immediate aftermath, the two polygraph tests, etc. He counters at length Phillip Klass's claim, based on an armchair investigation, that the whole story was an elaborate hoax. He gives a behind the scenes picture of the family, the crewmen, the press, the critics, the law—all working, for the most part, for their own separate interests with a remarkable and deplorable lack of coordination and ultimate concern. Barry brings up the Moody case, another possible CE III which occurred the same year,; 1975, in New Mexico. For good measure he throws in a variety of more or less related subjects ranging from animal mutilations to anti- gravity propulsion systems. These are both good books to add to your -UFO library. -Mildred Biesele MUFON AMATEUR — RADIO NETS SATURDAY: .40 meters, 7237 KHZ. 0700 (COST) .

Neither should they be accepted uncritically as evidence of . unidentified flying objects. The angels' hair phenomenon, delicate strands falling from the sky, has been observed before in other parts of the world. Samples of it have been hard to analyse. The threads evaporate before they can be scrutinised closely. Two aspects of the Feilding case make it likely to be angels' hair and not cobwebs. That well-known UFO inves- tigator Harold Fulton described the threads in detail without seeing them. His description came from those he had read after sightings overseas. Also, coincidental really, is the fact that Erich von Daniken, Chariots of the Gods author, is in New Zealand promoting his latest book which claims to prove the extraterrestrial origins of man. In his book he has an illustration of a manna- from-heaven machine. Are the threads manna? There are many who would like them to be. Add to this the opening of Encounters Of The Third Kind in Palmerston North on Friday, and we have all the conditions for a sudden burst of UFO sightings. There are many puzzling occurrences being revealed to a public hungry for evidence of the supernatural, paranor- mal, call it what you will. The solid reality of the external world is becoming flimsier and flimsier - almost vanishing like the threads that fell on those Feilding fields. EVENING STANDARD, THURSDAY.

Visually superb, and weirdly effective. Close En- couoten has an impact that must impress even the most sceptical of aerial phenomena. Although based on in- credible eye-witness reports from people who say they have met aliens from space, the film is no fun fantasy. It blends dazzling special effects, with human reactions, cul- minating in a believable documentary-type footage. It has not been made to frighten, but is more of a friendly epic, patiently de- tailing events leading to actual contact between extra-terres- trials and humans. The final 30 minutes are the most startling as the mother ship eases its wav ftentlv into the receiving station. Gasps of amazement from the audience as this \"carrier\" swept into sight lent further drama to a remarkable, and possible, contact. And apart from the saucers films (tart, the audience is taken from one different situation lo another, a proverbial maze that finally leads to Devil's Tower mountain, the meeting place. Richard Dreyfuss cleverly portrays the power company repairman who is \"frozen\" by a UFO, shaken, stunned, and facially burned by its powerful rays. And his obsession with the mysterious mountain leads him to a unique inter- planetary communication set-up.

Don't be upset if you cannot manage this to your satisfaction, you have lots of company. The movie makers, while trying valiantly, cleverly, and with noticeable success, to cast illumination on the great mysteries of the skies, create additional riddles themselves, the solution of which only becomes evident in the last few minutes of this mind-stretch- ing footage.

Sightings were made on five nights of an eight-day period, with Hashing lights, at times changing colour, moving at moderate and fast speeds, as well as remaining stationary. Mr Fulton said some sight- ings could have been a light commercial aircraft which now visits the city, alt hough in the flashing light sightings.

The Mutual UFO Network emphatically takes exception to having the scientific study of UFOs placed in the same category as the other diverse subjects being treated as one package by CSICP. The title of this article is not only disgraceful, but it shows the lack of continuity and the failure of CSICP to live up to its published purpose — to investigate unusual phenomena with open-minded skepticism, and to help the public distinguish between fact and fiction. If the public was to accept the prejudiced view of a \"committee of one\" — namely Philip Klass as the self- appointed authority on UFOs, and ignore the scientific endeavors and data collected by hundreds of qualified competent scientists, educators, and engineers throughout the nation, scientific progress in resolving \"the greatest mystery of our time\" would immediately become stagnant. It is a pity and a shame that Reader's Digest, a publication read throughout the world, should allow itself to be a vehicle for such unscientific trivia on UFOs and be literally \"used\" by a few people, posing as experts. I wonder what brand of catsup, Phil will use when he has to \"eat crow.\" In direct contrast to the article in Reader's Digest, the United Nations and its secretary general Kurt Waldheim recently asked an international panel of scientists to make recommendations for history's first worldwide study of Unidentified Flying Objects. The five-member panel, composed of noted French and American scientists, have already begun the initial .probe .of UFO materials never before released by various governments around the world. The five members on this panel are Dr. J. Allen Hynek, Dr. Jacques Vallee, Dr. David Saunders, Gordon Copper, and Dr. Claude Poher, who heads the official French UFO Research Study Group. MUFON was represented at the United Nations planning meeting by two board members, Leonard H. Stringfield and Ted Phillips, and 18 member Lee Speigel, in addition to our closely allied colleagues, Dr. Hynek, Dr. Saunders, and Dr. Vallee. The meeting was originally requested by Sir Eric Gairy, Prime Minister of Granada, and his to UN ambassadors George Griffith and Francis Redhead. Both Lee Speigel and Sir Eric Gairy'attended the meeting with Secretary General Waldheim and the five member panel. Lee is presently spearheading a visual aids program on UFOs to be delivered at a future date to a large segment of, United Nation representatives.

Issue Number Four or the Summer 1978 edition of this fine publication was recently received from Tom Adams, MUFON State Section Director in Paris, Texas, who had specialized on study of UFOs and their possible -relationship to. animal mutilations. Project Stigma represents an ongoing probe into the relentless wave of animal mutilations and mutilation-deaths, and is an attempt to coordinate and assist in information- gathering activities on the part of the pertinent and responsible investigative agencies and individuals.

The July issue of UFO REPORT has an interesting interview with Leonard Stringfield, plus articles by Dr. Berthold E. Schwarz, Brad Steiger and others. Good material is published side- by-side with very questionable articles in UFO REPORT, so reading it is very much a \"pick and choose\" operation. APRO's Coral Lorenzen contributes a good article on a Brazilian abduction case in the July issue of FATE. This particular claim has been the subject of some controversy (but what abduction case is not?), so it is good to see all the details brought to light.

Some of the highlights of this meeting, which would be of interest to MUFON members and Journal subscribers are submitted in capsulated form. Charles L. Tucker, State Director for Indiana, was elected Central Regional Director to fill the expiring term of Elmer A. Krai, former State Director of Nebraska. Also elected to the MUFON Board of Directors was Joseph Santangelo, presently State Director for Massachusetts, who will fill the expired term of David F. Webb as Eastern Regional Director. Paul Cerny and Henry McKay, Regional Directors for the Western States and Canada, respectively, continue on the Board, since their terms have not expired in these elective positions. Activity reports were given by the following State Directors: Joe Santangelo, Massachusetts; Henry McKay, Ontario; Willard P. Armstrong, Missouri; Paul Cerny, Northern California; Ted Spickler, West Virginia; Forrest Lundberg, Iowa; Charles Tucker, Indiana; Mrs. Mildred M. Biesele, Utah; Bruce Maccabee, Maryland; Larry Moyers, Ohio; Ted Bloecher, New York; Mrs. Cynthia Hind, Rhodesia; and Marilyn Epperson for Mrs. Idabel E. Epperson, Southern California. Joe Santangelo reported on the success of the MUFON Amateur Radio Net each Saturday on the 40 meter and 75 meter bands with the recommendation that the 20 meter net on Sunday afternoon be discontinued due to the inconsistent \"skip distance\" for satisfactory communications. Dr. Willard P. Armstrong gave a resume of the subjects discussed at the Consultants Meeting and their recommendations for greater effectiveness in helping MUFON resolve the UFO phenomenon. Mrs. Cynthia Hind, MUFON Representative for Rhodesia, stressed the need for a strong International Coordinator and recognized the need for Continental Directors to provide good communication links with the Foreign Representatives and National Directors. Work is continuing to implement this structure with additional people volunteering to fill some of these important posts. Emphasis was generated to continue improving the professional stature of The MUFON UFO Journal under the capable editorship of Richard H. Hall, and many suggestions were offered to increase Journal subscriptions and MUFON member- ship. Formal bids were placed in the minutes to have the 1980 MUFON Symposium in Houston, 1981 in Los Angeles or Southern California, and prospects for 1982 on the East coast or Toronto. The 1979 MUFON UFO Symposium will be held July 6 and 7 at the Airport Marina Hotel in San Francisco. Houston will soon be announcing the date and location for the 1980 event. Theodore Spickler, State Director for West Virginia, has appointed David A. Bodner, Box 122, Elkhom, W. Va. 24831, as State Section Director for Mingo, McDowell, Mercer, Wyoming, and Summers counties. David's telephone number is (304) 862-3635.

A caucus of State Section Directors present from New York nominated Dr. Gary Levine, CPO Box 1485, Kingston, N.Y.; telephone (914) 339-40%, presently a State Section Director, to the position of State Director for New York. His nomination, election, and approval was immediately forthcoming. \"UFOs! Horoscopes! (And Other Nonsense)\" by Kendrick Frazier, condensed from Smithsonian magazine is published in the July 1978 issue of Reader's Digest. It appears that the editors of Reader's Digest have been duped again, but to a far greater extent than by Ronald Schiller's \"Three UFOs — How Real Were They?\" that appeared in the November 1977 edition. The Committee for the Scientific Investigations of Claims of the Paranormal (CSICP) has taken the liberty of lumping such diverse subjects as the Bermuda Triangle, Ancient Astronauts, psychokinetic key benders, biorhythm, astrology, exotic religious cults, unidentified flying objects, Bigfoot, and the Loch Ness monster into one package and assigned volunteers to attack each segment. The title of the article, by Kendrick Frazier who is editor of \"The Skeptical Inquirer\", the CSICP publication, is designed to catch the readers' attention and, without scientific grounds, to throw UFOs into the same \"black pot\" that they label as unusual paranormal. Not all scientists, however, dismiss all claims of paranormal in the field of extrasensory perception (telepathy, clarivoyance, and precognition). Even Marcello Truzzi, professor of sociology at Eastern Michigan University and a former very vocal CSICP member, takes exception to lumping \"protoscientific\" researchers — those investigating ESP, for example, with \"mystical\" occultists whose claims cannot be demonstrated empirically.
