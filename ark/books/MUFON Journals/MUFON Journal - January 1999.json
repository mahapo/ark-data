A quiet Thursday evening in Ticonderoga, NY (population about 3,500-4,000). Fred and Mary (pseudonyms; witnesses requested anonym- ity) were working in their yard. It was about 8 p.m. when Fred looked up at the partly cloudy sky in the south- east and saw it. He was im- mediately struck by the fact that he could not see any wings. No noise, either. Sud- denly it dawned on him: maybe it was a UFO! He ran into his house to get the video camera which he keeps loaded and ready to use. About 10 seconds later Mary saw him running out the door with the video camera. He pointed the cam- era upward and started videotaping. Mary looked in the direction the camera was pointing and she, too, saw the object traveling northward through the sky east of them as he got about 12 1/2 seconds of video before the object disappeared above a cloud..Fred walked to another location to see if it might come out of the cloud but ... no luck. That was it. The sighting had lasted perhaps 25 to 30 seconds, maximum. About a week later Fred was wondering who to tell about this event. He managed to locate Stanton Friedman and a local MUFON investigator, Jim Bouck. Fred sent a copy of his video to Stanton, who then recommended that he call me, which he did on July 31. Subsequently he sent me his \"affidavit\" which re- counted the history of the event and the original video for analysis. Fred wrote about their sighting as follows: \"(We) observed an object in flight moving through the clouds (and) blue sky (between clouds) from south to north. The craft was soundless and wing- less and flew at a fairly fast rate of speed. The cloud ceiling level was 5,000 feet and (the object was) viewed at a 65 degree angle. It flew on the eastern side (of Ticonderoga, NY.) past St. Mary's Church. (My wife) viewed it with the naked eye and said it resembled a peanut, contoured some (i.e., narrowing down) in the center with a vertical black band or (vertical) line around the center portion of the object, and that she could hear no sound from it, nor did it have any wings. We both saw it as cream or beige in color. I also didn't see wings or hear any sound coming from it. That's the About the author Dr. Maccabee holds the Ph.D. in Physics, and is a research physicist at the Naval Surface Weap- ons Center in Silver Springs, MD. He is a former member of NICAP, and was one of the founders of the Fund For UFO Research (FUFOR). He has written nearly 100 articles in publications such as the Journal, and co-authored UFOs Are Real: Here's the Proof with Ed Walters. reason why I quickly ran into my house to get my video camera.\" The whole sighting took about a minute. TECHNICAL ANALYSIS Editor's Note: Figure 1 provided by Dr. Maccabee is not included in this edited article. The MUFON investigation determined that Fred first saw the object coming from the southeast at an azimuth of about 125 degrees. It was last seen at an azimuth of about 65 degrees. It took 25-30 seconds to cover this angular distance. The analysis described below indicates that either there was a single object with a very small (so small as to be unresolved by the video) structure connecting two larger white structures, or else there were two objects, with the second travel- ing at a fixed spacing close behind the first. There is no clear evidence in the video imagery of a connection between the white images. However, since the resolu- tion isn't good enough to prove there was no such con- nection, I refer herein to \"the object(s)\" in the singu- lar, thereby allowing for either possibility. The video begins with a wide angle view that shows the object(s) as a faint white dot in the sky, above thin clouds. The object(s) had passed its point of clos- est approach to the witnesses and was already travel- ing away when he began videotaping. During the first several seconds, Fred zoomed in on the object(s) and then he followed it as it moved to his left (north) past the cross on top of the church. After a few seconds it disappeared in the clouds just before it reached the edge of the roof of his house. The complete track of the object(s) recorded on video is a straight line about 10 degrees in length. The object(s) was optimally illumi- nated by the sun which was low in the west northwest at the time. Fred obtained about 378 frames, of which about five dozen have images clear enough for analy- sis. For most of the other frames, either the camera is out of focus, there is too much motion blur, or the object(s) is lost in the clouds. Two whitish images Figure 2 shows the object(s) just before it passed the top of the cross on the church steeple at an azimuth of about 70 degrees. The overall image con- sists of two whitish elliptical or ovoid images \"end to end\" with a darker space between them. This gap is more easily seen in the blowup inset which was ex-"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Page 4 January 1999 MUFON UFO Journal traded from a frame in the original video that occurred a few seconds after the object(s) passed the steeple. Blowups of the clearest images show, that the two white ellipses are separated by a very small distance and that between the elliptical images there is what certainly appears to be blue sky. Although there is no video evi- dence indicating a structure connecting the two ellipses, the image resolution is not sufficient to rule out the possibility of a narrow connecting structure between them. Probably 'bleeding' images Because the white images are somewhat brighter than the blue sky, the gap between them ap- pears as a dark area or vertical dark line, even though the area actually is a pale blue color (probably a result of the white images \"bleeding into\" the blue sky color in the gap). The two white ellipses traveled close to- gether without changing the spacing between them. The steeple is at an azimuth of about 70 de- grees (east northeast). The top of the cross was about 140 ft above the camera and about 267 ft away hori- zontally, according to measurements made by Fred and MUFON investigator Jim Bouck. Thus the angular el- evation of the top of the cross was about 28 degrees. Fred obtained the airport weather information for Glens Falls, NY. This showed about 20% sky cover at 5,000 ft, ground level visibility of 15 miles and zero wind speed. The object(s) was occasionally partially ob- scured, and at other times completely obscured, by thin clouds. Ultimately it was lost to view as it passed into or beyond a cloud at an altitude of at least 5,000 ft. Hence the radial distance from the camera as it passed the cross was at least 5,000/sin(28) = 10,700 ft. Yardstick calibration At my request Fred provided zoomed images of a yardstick at 69 feet. This allowed me to determine the angular size calibration. The analysis was done using computer-grabbed images from the original vid- eotape of the object(s) and of the yardstick, for which distances are measured in pixels. At full zoom the yard- stick image is 448 pixels long. The angular size of the yardstick at 69 ft is 0.0434 radians or 2.49 degrees (0.01745 radians per degree) so the angle per pixel is 9.75E-5 rad or 5.56E-3 deg. As the object(s) passed the top of the cross its overall length was about 19 (+/-)! pixels measured along the slanted axis (connecting the centers) of the elliptical image in Frame 189 (Figure 2). This corre- sponds to (1.85 +/- 0. 1 )E-3 rad in angular length. The overall length of any object, as projected onto a plane perpendicular to the sighting line (a plane parallel to the focal plane), is the product of the distance to the object and the angular size of its image as measured in radians (a good approximation for angles less than 10 degrees). At a distance of 10,700 ft along the sighting line, the projected length of the image corresponds to 10,700 x (1.85 +/- 0. l)E-3 = 20+/-1 ft. (If the object(s) were above cloud altitude the projected length would be larger than this.) Because the image actually appears as two el- liptical white areas that may be disconnected, a dimen- sion more applicable to these images is the'spacing of their centers. In Frame 189 this is about 9.5 pixels or 9.3E-4 radians. At 10,700 ft this corresponds to a pro- jected spacing distance of about 10 ft. Thus if these were two elliptical objects flying along, each was about 4 ft in radius, and they were traveling with a spacing of only a couple of feet. Of course, if the distance had been greater, then these dimensions also would be greater. The length just presented is not the actual length of the object(s) since it was viewed at an oblique angle. (This is the length as projected onto a plane parallel to the focal plane.) It is now necessary to estimate the actual length. Orientation assumption The actual length can be calculated only if one makes an assumption about the orientation in space of the major axis of the object(s). I have chosen to as- sume the major axis was horizontal and that the object(s) traveled in a horizontal plane at a constant altitude, although I could not rule out the possibility that it traveled upward or downwards at a small angle. Using angles a and e the actual overall length of the object(s) can be calculated from the projected length, 20 ft, again assuming that the object(s) axis lies in a horizontal plane (comparable to, but smaller than, a Piper Cherokee Lance or Beechcraft Model 76, single engine propeller driven airplane). The height of the object(s), allowing for the natural diffusion of the edges of the elliptical images, appears to be about 1/5 or 1/4 of the overall length, i.e., about 4 to 6 feet if at an alti- tude of 5,000 ft. Similarly, the centers of the white images were separated by 10 ft/0. 84 which is about 12 ft if at an altitude of 5,000 ft. Cloud calculations The object(s) was occasionally partially ob- scured and occasionally totally obscured by the clouds. This means that the object(s) could have been at cloud height or above. If above, then the calculated size would be larger. For example, if it were assumed to have been at 10,000 ft altitude the range would have been 21,400 ft (4 miles) and the overall length would be about 48 ft (comparable in size to a business jet [Gates Learjet] or fighter aircraft [e.g., Grumman A-6E]), ; if at 15,000 ft, then it would have been 6 miles away and about 72 ft long; if at 32,000 ft it would have been about 12 miles away and about 145 ft long (comparable to a Boeing 707). The object(s) passed behind the lightning rod at the top of the cross. It required 4 frames (at 30 frames/"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal January 1999 PageS FRAME 189 FIGURE 2 FRAME 189 5x BLOWUP FRAME 241 5x BLOWUP AIRPLANE ^COMPARISON ~— V' ••*; f.- FRAME j£'.''

If it were about 24 ft in length this would correspond to about 180 ft/sec or about 123 mph. If it had been twice as high, its speed would have been about 246 mph, and so on for other assumed heights. At a height of 32,000 ft the speed would have been nearly 746 mph, the speed of sound (at sea level). If this had been a large jet airplane \"breaking the sound barrier\" the witnesses might have heard a sonic boom even though the plane would have been about 13 miles away. Instead, on this quiet night with no wind, they heard nothing. The only conventional non-hoax explanation for this sighting is that the witnesses misidentified an airplane. However, the airplane hypothesis is not with- out its problems: why didn't the witnesses hear the aircraft, why couldn't they see any wings, and why did it appear, oddly enough, as two whitish ellipses with a darker, bluish area between? In answer to the last question, Jeffrey Sainio, MUFON image analyst, has pointed out that a glint (a very bright reflection of the sun) off the fuselage, the center of which was blocked from direct view by the wing closest to the observers, could appear as two bright objects with a dark space between. The answers to the first and sec- ond questions then follow from the glint hypothesis: the airplane was so far away that the wings and other portions of the airplane were not visible (even though the bright glints were visible) and the sound was too faint for them to hear. This explanation is based upon the idea that a glint actually occurred. It also assumes that the nearest wing blocked the direct view of the center of the fuse- lage, thus creating two approximately equal sized ar- eas, to the front and back of the wing, which made the white images. Since it appears that the object(s) was flying along a level and straight trajectory, i.e., a hypo- thetical airplane was not turning left or \"banking\" with"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Page 6 January 1999 MUFON UFO Journal its left wing downward, this explanation also requires that the wing be attached at the bottom of the fuselage so that it could be between an observer on the ground and the main body (sides) of the fuselage. It just so happens that many models of aircraft have the fuse- lage \"riding\" on top of the wing. For these aircraft the wing could obstruct the ground-level view of part of the fuselage even when the plane is flying level. If one assumes that this type of aircraft was flying past the witnesses, then one may propose the hypothesis that the two white images were glints from the front and rear portions of the fuselage while the nearest wing blocked the direct view of the center portion. A particular angle The glint or optimum reflection from a flat mir- ror (specular) surface takes place at a particular angle that satisfies the well-known reflection rule: angle of reflection (the \"specular reflection angle\") equals the angle of incidence. A non-specular (i.e., diffuse) but nevertheless smooth or \"shiny\" surface will reflect light over a wide range of angles, but the reflection will be brightest only over a small range of angles (a few de- grees) centered about the specular reflection angle. The amplitude of the reflection will decrease considerably as the angle is tilted away from the specular reflection angle. The glint hypothesis requires a particular align- ment between the sun, the assumed airplane, and the observers. The sun was at an angular elevation of about 5 degrees and an azimuth of about 297 degrees (ac- cording to the Expert Astronomer computer program). That is, the sun was about 27 degrees north of due west. As nearly as can be determined the axis of the assumed fuselage was at an azimuth angle of about 17 degrees measured as rotation clockwise from due north. Therefore, if the sun had been 17 degrees north of due west the sun rays would have been at an angle of 90 degrees (perpendicular) to the axis and the (specu- lar) reflection angle would also have been 90 degrees to the axis. However, since the sun was 27 degrees north of due west the sun rays were hitting the assumed fuselage at an angle of 90 - (27-17) = 80 degrees mea- sured as counterclockwise rotation from the direction the assumed airplane was traveling, i.e., from the 17 degree azimuth. This is the incident angle. The angle of reflection would be the same, 80 degrees from the axis, but measured as clockwise rotation from the di- rection opposite to the direction the airplane was trav- eling, i.e., 80 degrees measured clockwise starting at the 195 degree azimuth. The brightest glint would oc- cur at this angle of reflection. Along an azimuth Thus the brightest rays from the glint would be traveling along an azimuth of 195+80 = 275 degrees as measured at the location of the assumed airplane. Recall that the direction from the observers to the .object(s) was at an azimuth of about 70 degrees as the object(s) passed the steeple. The direction opposite to this 70 degree azimuth is the direction that reflected rays would have to travel from the assumed airplane to reach the observers. The opposite direction is 180 + 70 = 250 degrees. This is 25 degrees less than the azi- muth for maximum glint, 275 degrees, calculated above. In other words, the observers' viewing location was 25 degrees away from the direction for an optimum glint, too far for the glint to be much, if any, brighter than the ordinary diffuse reflection from the assumed fuselage. Fred saw the object(s) initially at an azimuth of about 125 degrees and he saw (videotaped) it again over the azimuth range from about 75 1/2 degrees to about 65 1/2 degrees. In other words, he saw it com- ing and going as it traveled in a straight line over a wide range in angles. A glint could not persist over such an angle range. Even within the relatively narrow range of about 10 degrees of azimuth captured on video one would expect a continual decrease in the glint brightness if there had been a glint. Fuselage glint ruled out However, the only changes are several in- stances where the brightness decreases and returns to the full value as the object(s) is obscured by clouds. The size of the angle away from the expected glint direction combined with the lack of brightness varia- tion attributable to alignment with the sun rules out glints from an airplane fuselage. If these images are glints, then they are glints from circular or elliptical objects, for which there is always some portion of the surface that satisfies the reflection rule. Since the glint explanation, with its accompa- nying assumption of great distance to a large airplane, is rejected, then the assumed aircraft must have been reasonably close (within several miles). In this case the most important reason for rejecting the aircraft ex- planation is the lack of any indications of wings. Fred and his wife have said they could see no wings on the object(s) even though they saw it over a wider range of angles than is represented in the video. The video images are small, but they support this claim. The right hand inset in Figure 2 shows a comparison image con- structed to look the way a typical T-shaped airplane would look if flying alongthe same path as the object(s). The question of wings As can be seen from the comparison \"airplane\" image, if the object(s) had been an airplane seen at the same angular elevation and direction of travel relative to the sighting azimuth the wings would have been vis- ible as protrusions above and below the image of the fuselage. Although the diagram shows the situation for a T shaped aircraft, the same situation would occur for"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal January 1999 Page? a large aircraft with swept back wings or a high per- formance jet (fighter): the outer end of the nearest wing would be silhouetted against the sky above the fuse- lage and the farthest wing would be silhouetted against the sky below the fuselage. Fred has demonstrated that his camera could have detected wings under roughly comparable viewing conditions by videotaping objects known to be aircraft. The wings are clearly visible. Figure 2 also has several blowups of the im- age. These are representative of roughly four dozen other images for which wings should be apparent if the object(s) were an aircraft. These blowups also show that the spacing between the white images appears to be blue or pale blue, as if some of the white color from the elliptical images was \"spilling over\" into the darker blue area. Such \"spillage\" is common for optoelectronic systems such as video cameras Not a distant aircraft For all the reasons cited, then, the image is not consistent with what would be expected if the object(s) was a distant aircraft. On the other hand, it is consis- tent with what might be expected if two elliptical ob- jects, white in color, close together and either connected by a small appendage or entirely separate, traveled at a moderate speed and moderate altitude (5000-10,000 ft) past the witnesses. In this height range each object would have been 8-16 ft in diameter. The MUFON investigation indicates that this was not a hoax, since the witnesses are upstanding citi- zens of the community, are both employed in law-enforcement, and have requested anonymity. Since the aircraft and hoax explanations are ruled out, the image can be considered to be that of a single uniden- tified flying object with two major whitish sections connected by a narrow structure not seen on the video, or of two whitish elliptical unidentified flying objects traveling in a close formation. By way of comparison, the statistical study carried out by the Battelle Memo- rial Institute under contract to the Air Force (Project 10073, Special Report #14, May 1955, published by the Air Technical Intelligence Center, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base) carefully studied 3201 sightings (des- ignated as \"All Sightings\") reported between January 1947 and the end of December, 1952. They determined that 689 sightings (21.5% of the total) were unexplained after analysis. Of these, 177 (26% of the unknowns) were of white or \"glowing white\" objects, 331 (48% of the .unknowns) were elliptical, 64 sightings (9%) involved two objects (150 involved more than 3 ob- jects), 56 sightings (8%) lasted 11-30 seconds and 61 (9%) lasted 31 to 60 seconds. I thank Fred and his wife for providing the origi- nal video along with calibrations and other video for the analysis. (c) B. Maccabee, 1998 New MUFON investigator initiated quickly By Paul Cook On Feb. 5, 1998 I received e-mail from Mel Podell, the San Diego MUFON Director. Though I correspond with Mel on a regular basis, this would turn out to be the beginning of my first case since com- pleting and passing the Field Investigators Exam. I didn't realize how much would be expected of me so soon. This is how the e-mail began: \"Yesterday, Wednesday Feb. 4, Brad McLellan of Channel 10 phoned me about having someone check on a videotape taken by a truck driver in New Mexico. Gary Davidson has checked on previous videotapes, but has been recovering from the flu. He does not feel well enough to handle this. Since you are now a ca- pable investigator with credentials, would you please if possible give this your best analysis.\" (snip) . He said that they wanted it for that night's news. I thought they wanted me to look at it, give an opinion, and then we would get the tape. I found out, after I showed up in wrinkled work clothes, that they wanted me on TV, and they wanted to know what this object was ... NOW. The logical and carefully phrased expla- nation that I gave as to how we would proceed with a serious and scientific investigation did not go over well with them. Something more emotional They did agree that I should investigate it thor- oughly, but what they wanted for the nightly news was something more emotional, and since I didn't think I'd get the tape if I didn't produce something for them, I began a discourse with the phrase, \"I believe in ex- traordinary possibilities.\" They chose the wildest of the comments, and while they were cutting and past- ing the evening's brief, I got them to call Bill Sauter, the videographer and witness of the UFO, and arranged to meet with him to get a VHS copy from the original. After an unsuccessful attempt (due to busy schedules) was made to get the tape, I finally went back to Channel 10 and talked them into making a copy from the one they used on the newscast. It wasn't very good, but I sent it to Gary Davidson, who is our local videoanalyst, to check it out. By the end of February I had his enhancement. The video looked like a balloon, except that it was moving steady and appeared to be in control, like a blimp. In the enhancement it appeared to me to be a saucer, but the light that was reflecting off of it made it hard to give it a shape. We needed the original. Finally, on July 5, we were able to get the origi- nal from Bill, who had been out of town. By this time it had been featured on \"Hard Copy,\" which had talked"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"PageS January 1999 MUFON UFO Journal with him while he was out of town. I had also posted a webpage 1 with information about it on our local website. 2 Though the video could be of some sort of blimp, Bill did not feel it was and said that it was ca- pable of sudden acceleration. Here is a portion of the transcript of the interview which was conducted while filling out the MUFON report forms: Bill Sauter: Well I was, Yeah I was headed westbound, back to ports California and, just to the west of Deming which would be exit 68... Mel Podell: Deming, New Mexico ... Sauter: yeah... that would be ...about ten miles west of Deming and approximately I'd say anywhere from ten to fifteen miles south of there... to southeast was where the spotting was and it appeared to be like a... best way to describe it is like a 747 without wings or a tail section... a metallic object... Paul Cook: Could you do this, maybe, timewise. What was the first indication that there was something to look for? Sauter: Oh there was jibber jabber on the CB radio from the people going in the other direction... they'll say \"Hey look, what was that in the air out there?\"... somebody says \" Ahh.. It's just a UFO.\" (edit) Sauter: Yeah... yeah, I heard them talking first and then, you know, as they say ... me traveling westbound and this was to my southeast, so my first glimpse I caught of it was in my mirror, then I pulled over to a safe spot.... Podell: Oh, as you were listening you noticed in your rear view mirror that... the object was there, right after you heard the people describe it? Describe it as it looked through the rear view mirror. Sauter: Like I say, it looked like a metallic object... like a 747 without wings or without a tail section... very shiny. Podell: How fast was it moving? Sauter: I have no idea. Podell: You couldn't tell. You were still driving? Sauter: Have no idea what the altitude was but, as they say, just from where those mountains are in the background, you know, I mean, normally a person can see anywhere from twelve to fifteen miles on flat ground with ... you know... Podell: Describe the day. What type of day? Sauter: 6:30 in the morning. It was very clear. Visibil- ity was great. No overcast. No haze, (edit) Podell: OK, how far did you drive along before the next event happened? ... I mean, after you noticed it in your rear view mirror? Sauter: Oh, I pulled in ... the next exit where I could pull off was exit 68, which, you know, was the safest place where I could pull off the road not the point where I got my camera out then. Podell: So you kept a camera with you? Sauter: Oh yeah, yeah, Camera's always(edit) Podell: What kind of camera? Sauter: 8 millimeter ... video Podell: Do you use it very frequently? Sauter: Uh hum Cook: Does it have a zoom? Sauter: Yeah., it's a 10 to 1 or 1 to 10 Cook: lOtol? Sauter: yeah, 10x1 Cook: Did you use it when you were videotaping? Sauter: yeah (edit) Cook: Now, did you videotape it the entire time you were looking at it? or ... tell me what happened. Sauter: Ahh, it was videotaped as far as I could, you know, and then the vibration was getting so bad as it was moving back... Cook: So you weren't watching it before you got the videotape... Sauter: No Podell: You say it was vibrating....? Sauter: Well, you know, vibrating as the truck, shak- ing up and down Podell: Oh, I see, you were., you didn't get out of the truck.

No video distortions are evident that would add artifacts to the image.\" We are looking forward to more enhancements and feel that the video cannot be explained as a blimp be- cause of the witness testimony. The witness is cred- ible, and the investigation continues. I am continuing to gain valuble experience as an investigator and hope that others will have the opportunity to learn at a slower pace, though I must admit, I am enjoying it, every minute.

As ufology struggles to maintain a credible, scientific, nuts and bolts approach, alien abduc- tion reports continue to rise with subjective and nonsensi- cal fervor. One can look at this thorn in the side as a symp- tom of a larger problem that has yet to be diagnosed in the body of humanity. As an abductions re- searcher of 15 years, and from the perspective of female in- tuition, I contend that most ufologists and abduction re- searchers are so adamant about the nuts and bolts that they overlook the whole drama of what is taking place in abductees' lives. Specifically, I am referring to a variety of alien-orchestrated human bonding dramas, relationship manipulations, and love obsessions that are carried out in the abductee population. Raggedy Ann & Andy This angle of approach is better understood if you place yourself in the position of a drama director. Imagine, for a moment, watching a children's puppet show. Raggedy Andy meets Raggedy Ann. They flip and flop to the tune of an enigmatic love affair. Rag- gedy Andy courts his beloved Ann, wooing her to that anticipated kiss. Raggedy Ann swoons into a spell of romantic love. The curtain closes. Next scene: Raggedy Ann is yearning for her newfound knight in shining armor. Raggedy Andy sees her, but instead of running to embrace her, turns around and walks off stage, leaving Ann grieved with unre- quited love. Raggedy Andy and Ann are not really puppets; they're real people who have had lifelong alien encounters. The puppet masters are the aliens playing the role of the proverbial Cupid and his arrow. Perhaps a puppet show is a harsh analogy for the lives of some abductees caught in the dramas of the alien matchmakers. But I adjure you to take a look from a different perspective, one that asks different questions regarding the modus operand! of the alien About the author Eve Frances Lorgen has been a researcher in the alien abduction phenomenon for more than 15 years and conducts a support group for experiencers in north San Diego County, CA. She holds a Master's of Arts degree in Counseling Psy- chology, a Bachelor of Science in Biochemistry, studies in oriental medicine, dreamwork, paranor- mal and the occult, the Bible, reverse speech, alien implant research, fluorescence markings post ab- duction, and health and medical issues of abductees. She has published several articles internationally. Currently she is co-authoring a book with Barbara Bartholic entitled The Love Bite, which should be out sometime in 1999. Editor's Note: If there are UFOs, if there are occupants, if there are abductions, and if aliens are somehow manipulating humans, then the sce- narios described by Ms. Lorgen are not so far- fetched as they might appear at first glance. In fact, given the importance that we humans place on sex-in music, advertising, and affairs of the heart-perhaps it would be more surprising if aliens were not also interested in sexual manipulation. The term alienation of affections may have more rami- fications than we have thought. intelligence. Throughout my experience studying and counseling abductees and \"experiencers,\" I can confi- dently say that the alien presence-or whoever is act- ing behind its image-exerts a heavy influence on their lives, sometimes down to the lovers they meet and even the very partners they choose to marry. Budd Hopkins' famous Brooklyn Bridge UFO abduction investigation brought to light this rarely dis- cussed aspect of alien directed human bonding arrange- ments in some abductees' lives. This investigation, de- scribed in Mr. Hopkins' book, Witnessed, recounts the dramatic story of \"Linda Cortile's\" UFO abduction in 1989 from an apartment window in Manhattan. Three men witnessed the extraordinary event, one of whom (Richard) Linda Cortile had previously met in her ab- ductions as a child and young adult. Alien-orchestrated bonding These mutually shared encounters and dream- like scenarios that took place between Linda and Ri- chard can be described as alien orchestrated bonding exercises. According to Hopkins, the bonding that Linda and Richard experienced are not isolated inci- dents in the abductee population, but are rare. Mr. Hopkins has observed the bonding dramas in 14 out of 650 cases, which accounts for roughly 2% of all his cases. Barbara Bartholic, a hypnotherapist and abduc-"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"Page 10 January 1999 MUFON UFO Journal tions researcher of 25 years, has observed that many of these alien-manipulated bonding dramas result in dramatic love obsessions. Ms. Bartholic maintains that the bonding phenomenon carried out by aliens occurs much more frequently than one would think. Ignoring these dramas results in a serious lack of understanding concerning the alien intelligence and their motives for interacting with humanity. A characteristic pattern The bonding experiences exhibit a character- istic pattern and sequence of events that goes some- thing like this: an abductee meets another abductee during one or more alien abductions or in very vivid dreams. The couple may interact on a verbal or physi- cal level to initiate the bonding process. This can oc- cur several times until a strong emotional connection occurs. The nature of the bonding exercises seems to be tailor-made to the individual. The bonding interactions may or may not be consciously recalled by either partner. Often, only one partner will remember the experience, while the other has no memory or only a vague recall. When both part- ners meet in real life, there is an instant sense of rec- ognition, and the couple may fall in love. There are variations to the pattern and sequence of events, but in most cases one partner falls in love more than the other and is left feeling unrequited. A magnetic attraction The relationship between the two bonded in- dividuals is such that both persons are magnetically attracted to one another, often in unlikely situations. The love relationship set-up may include a number of bizarre synchronicities, vivid dreams, supernatural events, and bonding exercises during alien encounters. The orchestrated experiences are often intimate and sexual, such that one or the other develops an intense chemistry and love obsession with the targeted part- ner. Oftentimes, either person is married to-or has an existing relationship with-another mate. It makes no difference. The emotional, passionate and even telepathic connection between the bonded pair is unlike normal relationships (whatever normal is, anyway). Some have described it as the most exhilarating love imaginable, to the point of total spiritual immersion or indwelling with their \"beloved.\" Then the inevitable happens. It's absolutely devastating. The targeted love partner becomes \"switched off,\" and the love-struck other-half becomes painfully unrequited. The switching off is described as an emo- tional and sexual disinterest in their once \"attractive\" partner. The chosen partner may have an initial attrac- tion or even a strong love for the other, but then loses interest, often right after an abduction or vivid dream. If one or the other abductee has a good recall of their dreams and abduction memories, they may remember being previously bonded together in one or more ex- periences. Some abductees report spontaneous remote viewing images and visions of the intended partner in such a way as to elicit emotions, such as jealousy, ob- sessive love, yearning, and grievous unrequited love pangs. The alien-manipulated love obsession process is akin to a carrot being dangled just enough to get the obsessed lover into a constant cycle of love and unre- quited love. This can extend from relationship to rela- tionship and is emotionally exhausting. Barbara Bartholic and I have compiled a num- ber of abduction cases where a love obsession, rela- tionship manipulation, or some other type of obses- sion took place as part and parcel of the alien abduc- tion experience. In our co-authored book, The Love Bite, I take a closer look at the modus operandi of the alien intelligence by the very nature of the orchestrated dramas themselves. The Love Bite will consist of actual cases of alien-directed human bonding matches, relationship ma- nipulations, and dramatic love obsessions. A signifi- cant portion of the work comprises a brilliantly por- trayed commentary on a psychological, mythical, mys- tical, and spiritual warfare perspective. The various \"love bite\" cases range from the less spectacular rela- tionship manipulations (marital break-ups and question- able sudden urges to marry a particular mate) to bla- tant infatuations and love obsessions with unlikely part- ners, replete with high emotional drama and disastrous chaos. For example, one person, while engaged, sud- denly, without rhyme or reason, broke off the engage- ment and decided to marry another mate within a short period of time. Thereafter, the abductee's children start having alien encounters, while the non-abductee spouse (or abductee spouse who is in denial) is unbelieving, leaving their marriage partner in emotional isolation. The marriage ended in divorce, either from lack of com- patibility, or a combination of things-including alien interference. Partner in denial In other cases, both husband and wife may be having alien contacts, while one partner is in denial of what is happening. The marriage may be manipulated such that one partner is switched off (usually after a series of abductions or wave of activity)~leaving the other partner vulnerable for further manipulation by the aliens. (Compound this with the normal temptations of infidelity.) The rejected mate and the \"switched off spouse is then open for another love bite set-up with other partners, if not kept in check. The real culprit is the lack of awareness of how the aliens interfere-and how to combat the effects-before the relationship or"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal January 1999 Page 11 family unit is destroyed. Some abductees handle the bonding experience well, especially if they are on the non-unrequited end of the love bite, or if the bonding engendered a mutual friendship. But for those who developed a love obses- sion with a partner and were unable to consummate the love, it is very difficult. Abusive marriages Many female abductees have entered into con- trolling and abusive marriages, ensuring a constant life of victimization and crisis that prevents them from ad- dressing the core issues of abductions. I believe these types of relationship problems are primarily due to un- resolved abduction-related psychological issues, other personal family affairs, and direct interference by the alien handlers. The point I want to make here is that these re- lationship issues are unique to the abductee popula- tion. They need to be addressed as such, taking into consideration the reality of alien abductions. In other words, simply going to counseling, hypnosis, or other psychological therapeutic modes is not fully effective in treating these complex relationships. In another anonymous case, a married couple went on a camping trip together. Everything was fine in the relationship until after an abduction during the camping trip. Afterwards, the partner who was ab- ducted became emotionally and sexually switched off from their spouse and started using drugs. The sub- stance abuse destroyed the marriage, and abductions increased-further undermining the strength of the mar- riage and the family unit. Barbara Bartholic has investigated cases that would shock most researchers-let alone the uninformed mainstream. In fact, there seems to be an unspoken \"no talk rule\" about the more taboo elements of \"nega- tive\" abduction reports, especially if shape-shifting rep- tilian aliens are reported! This serves to maintain the secrecy of alien abductions, forcing many experiencers into the inevitable \"Stockholm Syndrome.\" Shift in attitudes In fact, some therapists and support group fa- cilitators across the country and abroad have admitted to me in private that there appears to be a shift in abductees' attitudes towards alien contact. Many experiencers have accepted the reality of lifelong alien interaction, and may even welcome it. Instead, they choose to focus primarily on the positive aspects of being an experiencer, such as having psychic and spon- taneous healing abilities. The distractions outnumber the nuts and bolts in the UFO abduction phenomena. If we can get through the cloak and dagger confusion that the alien intelli- gence presents, then perhaps we will find that the very heart of the matter is in the human drama itself. Filer's Files George Filer By George A. Filer MUFON Eastern Regional Director, Majorstar@aol.com (609) 654-0020 Albert M. Chop, deputy public relations direc- tor, National Aeronautics and Space Administration, and former United States Air Force spokesman for Project Blue Book stated, \"I've been con- vinced for a long time that the fly- ing saucers are real and interplan- etary. In other words we are be- ing watched by beings.\" Kentucky object Kenny Young reports an unusual \"blue-object\" was spot- ted in Northern Kentucky on Dec. 13,1998. Blue UFOs, suspected black helicopters, power outage and earth tremors were reported in Northern Kentucky Sunday evening. A caller to the Bill Boshears radio program \"Sci-Zone,\" on A.M. Radio 700 WLW, reported visually observing a \"blue-colored\" object descending from the sky in an area near the Eastgate Mall, located off of Interstate 275 in Clermont County. The caller questioned if the object he observed could have been a meteor. While Pennsylvania researcher Stan Gordon, the guest for the program, listened intently, the caller reported the blue- colored object around 10:35 p.m. during the radio pro- gram. A separate, independent report of a blue-col- ored object seen near Hopeful-Church Road in Boone County, KY, was received at 12:30 p.m. by telephone from a resident of Florence, KY. This person, whose name will be withheld to honor privacy concerns, left her place of employment near Burlington, KY, at 11 p.m. and was driving home. She had not heard the radio program and is an independent source. While traveling south on Hopeful-Church Road at 11:15 p.m., she reported spotting a large triangular object that seemed to be hovering. The object was composed of very prominent blue lights which blinked or traced in a vertical pattern. This vertical arrangement struck the witness as very unusual. She said that she almost hit a curb while looking at the object. With her car running, she could not discern any noise. She was impressed of a triangular structure behind the lights by discern- ible against the \"skyglow\" caused by light pollution in the Florence area, and by a partial luminance of the (Continued on Page 20)"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"Page 12 January 1999 MUFON UFO Journal Ufologv Profile Stan Gordon continues to search By Dwight Connelly Thirty-three years ago a 16-year-old kid be- gan an investigation that has yet to see a conclusion. The kid was Stan Gordon, and the incident was the Kecksburg, PA, landing case which he has helped to make famous. Stan was, in fact, already an experi- enced researcher by the time he began investigating Kecksburg, having started his career in ufology six years earlier at the tender age of 10. Like many ufologists, he got hooked on the subject after listening to exciting radio programs. This led to trips to the local library by the 10-year-old re- searcher, then to actually calling up witnesses. Six years later, in December of 1965, came the case that has held Stan's interest to this day-Kecksburg. \"I really wanted to get involved with that case,\" he explains, \"but I didn't get very far then. However, I began to get more and more bits of information on up through the 1980's. In 1987 our ufology display at the Greengate Mall resulted in finding our first primary witness, Jim Romansky, who actually saw the object on the ground before the military came in.\" As time passed, more witnesses were found, and Stan recently created a 92-minute VHS video tape documentary which covers Kecksburg in detail (see June 1998 MUFON UFO Journal). However, he says the case is still open, despite the many witnesses which have been located and interviewed. \"The paper trail has been well hidden,\" he notes. Through the years Stan has investigated nu- merous cases, including one that had the unusual ele- ments of both a UFO and two \"Bigfoot\" type crea- tures (see sidebar article). Some of his early work was with the UFO Research of Pittsburgh organization, an outgrowth of the NICAP group, which also included Stan Friedman. Gordon served as the coordinator for telephone reports, and it was his job to decide if the reports coming in warranted an investigation. Around 1970 this group disbanded, and Stan continued on his own, setting up a UFO hotline. \"There were too many reports to keep up with by myself,\" he recalls, \"so in 1970 I founded the Westmoreland County UFO Study Group.\" He notes that the group included scientists, law enforcement personnel, and military retirees. In 1975 the organiza- tion expanded to become the Pennsylvania Center for UFO Research. In 1981 Stan formed the Pennsylvania Asso- ciation for the Study of the Unexplained (PASU). This group included volunteers in many specialties, includ- Stan and Debbie Gordon. ing scientists, engineers, technicians, law enforcement personnel, and former members of the military. \"We had a lot of good equipment,\" says Stan, \"ran a 24- hour operation, and met every month. People didn't get bored.\" He notes that some people came to meet- ings as skeptics, but often left as convinced members. This group was active until 1993. Gordon says one of the keys to getting good cooperation from law enforcement personnel is con- tinuous contact and continuous education. \"Most po- lice agencies in our area-and sometimes out of the area- automatically call me when there is a report,\" he notes. \"They are glad to have someone to refer cases to.\" Stan says he began hearing about abduction cases in the Pittsburgh area in the late 1960's. \"The pattern seemed to be landings, being taken aboard, and being questioned,\" he says, \"but I don't recall a lot of physical examinations reported. I do recall at least one case in which a propulsion problem was reported.\" Another case that Stan recalls involved a busi- nessman going for parts, then finding himself hours away on the Pennsylvania Turnpike. Under hypnosis he gave a very detailed description of the interior of the craft, the equipment, and symbols observed, from the perspective of where he was lying on a table. There have also been some physical trace cases, stretching over many years. \"There have been some interesting materials left,\" he notes. \"Though man-made, why were they found at these particular"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal January 1999 Page 13 -V locations?\" Other sites have had burn marks. He says a number of these, oval-shaped in this case, were found in Butler County in 1990 in conjunction with witnesses reporting \"something strange\" in the area. Analysis of one of the sites a week later showed no sign of an accelerant being used. While the investigating team was there, a UFO described as \"like a child's top rotat- ing\" appeared in the sky, and three people videotaped it. A woman a mile down the road was videotaping it at the same time. Gordon has also investigated a couple of crop circle cases without reaching any conclusions, \"but there were no tracks going in or out of the area.\" After nearly forty years of investigating, Stan has not lost his enthusiasm. \"UFO investigations have affected every part of my life,\" he says. \"It never stops. Many times I wish I had never heard of UFOs, but ufology is so intriguing and important that I can't stop. I did semi-retire in November of 1993 when I got mar- ried, but I got back into it and my wife Debbie is very supportive.\" And what has Stan concluded about UFOs af- ter 40 years of investigation? \"Well,\" he says, \" I've never seen one myself. It is my feeling that there is more than one source for the UFO sightings which re- main in the unexplained category. A small number of these are probably extraterrestrial. Some are likely related to little-known natural phenomena, and there are the high strangeness reports which contain elements of the paranormal and are reported by seemingly re- sponsible individuals.\" Gordon reports on case that caused him to reconsider Bigfoot By Stan Gordon Twenty five years ago, I was directing the Westmoreland County UFO Study Group based in Greensburg. I had started this volunteer research group in 1970. In 1973 a major UFO wave broke out across the country, and hundreds of sightings were being re- ported in the Keystone State. Then to make the situa- tion even stranger, sightings of Bigfoot-like creatures began to be reported over a multi-county area in both western and eastern Pennsylvania. These reports con- tinued for several months, then began to slow down. Reports taken seriously Interestingly, the media and police agencies for the most part took the reports seriously, and our UFO Hotline number was literally deluged with reports and questions. I had set up a communications center in my home, and we were radio dispatching investigators to the sites as reports were coming in. We were conduct- ing this research around our regular jobs, but in many cases, we had teams on site within minutes to hours after a UFO or creature sighting was reported. But it was one case which occurred that made us aware that there were some aspects of the UFO and Bigfoot mys- tery that are even stranger than were first apparent. As I have stated since this event, most unex- plained UFO sightings are not reported with Bigfoot encounters. And most sightings of Bigfoot have no as- sociation with UFO reports. But here in Pennsylvania we investigated a few cases where both were seen at the same time. In other cases, A UFO would be re- ported in an area, and soon Bigfoot reports would come from that area, or vise versa. Cases historically true What association there exists between the two anomalies, if any, remains open to speculation. I must stress that these cases are historically rare, and some are well documented. It was my position as an investi- gator to gather the data, and present the information, not to hide the facts that were uncovered because it would cause controversy from both cryptozoologists and ufologists who have their theories as to what these phenomena represent. Briefly, on the night of Oct. 25, 1973, my UFO Hotline was active with UFO reports from around the state. About 10:30 p.m. that evening, I received a call from a state trooper from the Uniontown barracks concerning an incident which he had just returned from investigating. One of those in- volved was put on the phone for me to interview. At about 9 p.m. about 15 people had observed a very large red spherical object hovering low in the sky which began to descend towards a pasture. The witness and two boys proceeded up the field and ob- served a white dome-shaped object on the ground that illuminated the area and was making a loud whirring sound. It was estimated to be about 100 feet in diam- eter. They were about 250 feet from the object, and about 75 feet from a fence line. Walking along the fence line were two tall figures, 7 to 9 feet tall, covered with hair, with arms hanging down past the knees, and dis- playing glowing green eyes. The creatures were fired upon. First tracers were shot overhead, then live ammo was used. The largest of the two creatures turned towards the other, almost touching it, and at the same time the object in the field disappeared, and the sound stopped. The crea- tures slowly walked towards the woods. One boy had already run home. The other two left the field, went to the farmhouse, moved the family members to a neighbor's home, and called the state police. A glowing area When the trooper arrived he and the main wit- ness went to the site, and where the object had landed there was a glowing area that, according to the trooper,"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"Page 14 January 1999 MUFON UFO Journal was about 150 feet in diameter. He said he could read a newspaper from the amount of light that it was emit- ting. The farm animals refused to go into the area. The witness we talked with has always stated that before they left the field, the largest of the two creatures was seen in the woods about 10 feet from them, and he shot at it and it struck the fence that stood between them. Later that night our team arrived in the area. Radiation levels were normal, and the glowing area was now gone, but animals still wouldn't go near the spot. Strange events began to occur during the early morning hours in this dark, secluded location. Farmhouse lights up A farmhouse several hundred feet from us was seen by some in the party to suddenly light up like daylight for several seconds. A bull in the field and a dog seemed unconcerned about us, and were looking into the woods. The main witness, a rather large indi- vidual, while being questioned suddenly began to growl, throwing his father and my assistant, George Lutz, towards the ground. The man ran into the field growling like an animal and emitting screams, one which was near inhuman. His own dog approached him as to attack, then ran off whimpering. The man sud- denly collapsed onto the ground. Then two of my team members began to complain that they were having trouble breathing. Suddenly the air was filled with a strong odor that can best be described as rotten eggs. The man, as he came out of what appeared to be an almost trance- like state, began talking about visions he saw about the end of the world, etc. Not knowing what could hap- pen next, we helped each other back to our vehicles. It was apparent that professional help was required in this case, and eminent psychiatrist Berthold E. Schwarz was contacted. Dr. Schwarz traveled to Pennsylvania at his own expense and interviewed all of those in- volved, including the eyewitnesses and the state trooper. The follow-up There is much more detail to this case, and I spent years following the life of the principal involved. There were many paranormal events which reportedly occurred in the years following this episode. And many years later, in a follow-up interview, an MIB event as- sociated with the case was revealed. For a more detailed account of the case see Dr. Schwarz's article, \"Berserk,\" in Flying Saucer Review, Vol. 20, No. 1 (Jan-Feb, 1974), or \"An Encounter in Fayette County\" in True Tales of the Unknown, Vol.11, published by Bantam Books, November, 1989. This was a well-documented event involving numerous individuals who had no interest in the un- usual. If you are aware of any similar cases please con- tact me.

Reviewed by Dwight Connelly This is an easy-to-use, general introduction and reference CD which is decidedly pro-UFO, pro-ani- mal mutilation ties with UFOs, pro-government coverup, pro-abduction, etc. While the disk can be run on computers without sound capability, this is not advisable. Those expecting to find as much on this six- hour CD as one would find in, say, Jerome Clark's The UFO Book will be disappointed, though the trek through the CD will probably be more fun. There is a wealth of photos and a fair amount of editorial mate- rial, all enhanced with special effects and sound. Access to the material is through a pyramid system of choices. The first thing to greet users is a triangular UFO with three light beams: one for the In- troduction by retired Command Sgt. Maj. Robert O. Dean, one for \"How to use this disk,\" and the third for the actual anthology. In using the anthology, you first click on a broad topic, such as UFO Descriptions, UFO History, UFOs Worldwide, U.S. Government, Crop Circles, Abduc- tions, or Mutilations. Then you go to a sub-topic, such as (in UFOs Worldwide) Brazil, Ireland, United States, etc. As another example, you can move from the gen- eral topic of Abductions to the specific topic of Fa- mous Abductions (Antonio Villa Boas, Betty and Barney Hill, the Anders Case, Patrolman Shirmer, Travis Walton, Kathie Davis, Betty Andreasson, and Linda Cortile). Some viewers might quarrel with the selection of the specific eight \"famous\" abduction cases, won- dering why their favorite case, such as Pascagoula, was not there. In Clark's 705-page The UFO Book, for example, there are 15 abduction cases. Overall, how- ever, this CD covers a great deal of material-though not in much depth. There are references to various printed materials at the end of the presentations, so those looking for more information have a place to go. Among those involved in this production are Colin Andrews, Yvonne Smith, Dr. Richard Haines, Dr. Roger Leir. Jaime Maussan, Prof. Sun Shi Li, Jaime Rodreguez, Jorge Martin, Linda Moulton Howe, and Peter Sorenson. Additional volumes are apparently planned, but there is no indication of how they might work in conjunction with this one.

Each of the sightings has been entered into their computer data base from the three major is- lands that compose the state of Malta in the Mediterra- nean Sea. It would not be feasible to publish all of the full reports in the Journal. However, some of the more interesting UFO sighting reports have been screened for publication. 18 June, 1845. Witnesses: Sailors of the ship \"Victoria\"; location: Latitude 36,40'56\"N, Longitude 13,44'36\"E. Source: The Malta Times, 18 June, 1845. The ship \"Victoria\" was 900 miles from Adalia, Tur- key, when the crew spotted three white objects com- ing out of the sea about half a mile from the ship. These objects were watched for about 10 minutes by numer- ous sailors. (Report of the British Association, 1861, page 30) The coordinates given are actually in Maltese waters. Summer 1947. Witnesses: Pawlu Zammit and others; location: 20 miles south of Malta; Object: Black Submarine. Fishermen on a boat 20 miles south of Malta were raising their nets with a catch offish when they saw an object floating on the water's surface. The fish- ermen were frightened because they thought it looked more like a monster than a submarine, so they quickly pulled their nets and started the boat's engine. At that moment a bright light from the \"submarine\" lit up the whole area and \"little men\" began running over the deck of the object. The fishermen couldn't make out much detail from their boat, but whenever the light il- luminated the \"little men\" they could see some sort of apparatus around their waist. When the witness was asked how tall these men were, he replied, \"About the size of a 10-year-old boy.\" After a few minutes, the \"little men\" entered the \"submarine\" which began to glow so brightly that the fishermen couldn't see the object. It then submerged. 25 June 1977. Witnesses: Raymond De Giovanni and Charles Mamo. Location: On a boat in the Grand Harbour, Malta. The first ever photos of a UFO taken by a Maltese. The photos show two bright luminous objects which seem to move at great speeds, enough to leave bright, zig-zagging streaks on film taken at l/250th of a second shutter speed. These photographs were published in the newspaper, It-Torca. Source: The Times of Malta. 6 May 1996. Witness: J. J. Mercieca (myself); Location: Mriehel Bypass (near Qormi); Object: cyl- inder shape; Sound: too far off to hear anything. At 12:20 p.m. (noon), I noticed an \"aircraft\" in the sky in the direction of Qormi. What caught my eye was the seemingly bright sun's reflection off the fuselage, which was blinding when looked at directly. The reflection dimmed in a couple of seconds as if the \"aircraft\" was banking and suddenly the \"plane\" was not there any- more! It just blinked out! The sky was cloudless, so it couldn't have flown into a cloud. The object was roughly 2 cm long at arm's length. 27 September 1996 Witnesses: Mario Borg and family; Location: \"West side of Malta\"; Object: Red and orange cylinder; Sound: none. At 6:15 p.m., Mario Borg was out on the balcony feeding his birds when he looked up and saw a red and orange cylinder (approximately 1 foot long, but distance to the object remains unknown). The object stayed still for about 10 minutes and then slowly faded while leaving a zig-zag line. 13 September 1998. Witnesses: Joseph Farrugia, wife and children; Location: Blue Lagoon, Comino. Object: Three orange flashing lights: Sound: none. Joseph Farrugia, his wife and children were on their boat near the Blue Lagoon near the small island of Comino when they saw three flashing orange lights in the shape of a triangle. The lights remained station- ary for five minutes and then disappeared. The time of the sighting was roughly 7 p.m. Some of the long narrative reports have not been published due to space limitations in the Journal. The Mutual UFO Network expresses its appreciation to Mr. Mercieca for allowing MUFON to file his sub- mitted UFO sighting reports for Malta.

With the aid of computer hardware and software, I have been working on the \"Ramey letter\" problem, and think I should pass along at least some partial and tentative, but potentially important, results. (A portion of the letter is printed at the bottom of this page.) Using (so far) two different image-enhancement software packages, I have been able to look at the im- age both on-screen and in laser printouts, and have been able to try many different combinations of light/dark, contrast, size, image stretching, zooming, negativizing, and the like. To date I have been able to corroborate most of the Filer transcription given in the November 1998 issue of the Journal, with one possibly signifi- cant difference. Where the Filer transcription gives (on the same line with \"DISK\") the reading AT 0984, some of the 70-or-so different printouts I have produced seem to show a different result. First, the 8 is just about cer- tainly a 4. and I make the most likely reading of the four-digit sequence as 0940, though at best some of these digits are less than clear. It appears that there is a hyphen immediately in front of them that has been missed. Further, the Filer reading gives AT for the two- character sequence preceding, but in some of my print- outs there is considerable doubt about the A, and in fact some printouts suggest an intriguing alternative: in some versions, if one uses a magnifying glass, the letter may well be an M. The second letter in the se- quence in any case looks, under magnification, like a J, and if this whole sequence really says something like MJ-0940,1 scarcely need point out that it would raise some interesting questions about when and how Truman put the whole \"Majestic\" structure together. (Have a look at the much-disputed Majestic briefing document and you will note a reference to a contin- gency designation MJ-1949-04P/78, so that the MJ+four-digit configuration perhaps has good prece- dent.) The line above \"DISK\" appears to say THE VICTIMS OF THE (as in the Filer transcription) with a five-character group following what looks like MAJ(something)(something). It looks like MAJOR, but I can't see what sense that would make in context. At the beginnings of the line including \"DISK,\" right up next to Gen. Ramey's now famous thumb, there appears to be a word starting with M and per- haps containing SS; with a little stretch it might say MESSAGE, for example. Then it's ON THE \"DISK\" (ON could conceivably be IN) and the words follow- ing appear to be something like MUST HAVE SENT THE. At that point we're back up to what might or might not say MJ-0940. In these imagings of the crucial letter, the A-versus-M question is tricky at best (it's the light • Extreme enlargement of a portion of the Ramey letter, as provided by Dr. Donald R.

But we have to get one. As I see it, this is turn- ing out to be the most important problem anyone in the field of UFO studies has ever worked on. Donald R. Burleson, Ph.D. Pine Bush revisited I was surprised when several people called to tell me I was in a current article on Pine Bush in the MUFON Journal—let alone a positive one. My only problem with the article is the wrong and outdated in- formation put forth by Scott C. Carr—as well-intended as it may have been: (1) My talk show career was far from short-lived and is far from over. Between 1987 and 1996, I ap- peared on Geraldo, People Are Talking, Joan Rivers (twice), Larry King, Sonja Live, Sightings (now out on video tape), Encounters, Strange Universe, Dennis Wholley, appeared in a Japanese documentary on UFOs (NIPPON TV), and there are others I'm probably leav- ing out. I've been on at least 300 radio talk shows, including Radio Free Europe. I've been written about in the New York Times and many other newspapers and magazines. I'd hardly call this having my book, Silent Invasion, fall on \"deaf ears,\" as Carr writes. The only deaf people have been in the UFO community-a small number considering the vast population on this planet. (2) Carr writes, \"As of January of this year [1998], sky watching has been banned in Orange County [NY]. Though the legalities of this are uncer- tain ... apparently anyone found guilty of trespassing or parking with the intention of \"sky watching\" will be subject to incarceration and/or fine. Many of the re- searchers have moved their efforts to ... Wanaque, NJ ... and have dubbed it The New Pine Bush.\" I don't know where Carr got this information, but it is wrong. There is no such law in Orange County- a huge county north of NYC. Pine Bush is one tiny little town in it. Anyone trespassing on private prop- erty was, and still is, always subject to the owner's whims-as it is across America. Pine Bush police tell me there is still an onslaught of UFO watchers from all over the world coming to the town, and they direct them toward the proper streets. Many police officers on and off-duty pull over to \"sky watch,\" and they en- courage people to do it safely-and to let the police know if you are having a sighting so they can see it. I already have extensive evidence that most of the operation has been pulled underground and have most of a second book finished. Ellen Crystal!, Ph.D. Scott Carr replies: The information concerning the skywatching restrictions were taken from reports and personal ex- perience. As noted in the article, I questioned the ac- tual legality of what I and others saw taking place around us in Pine Bush in 1998. Connection between ME and Aliens? I am about to begin researching what I believe may be a possible connection between \"Myalgic En- cephalomyelitis\" (Chronic Fatigue Syndrome) & Alien abductions. I am employed as entertainer/marketing man- ager/Project Launch Leisure Industry and also a con- tributing writer For Alien Encounters magazine UK (now defunct). I have been a UFO researcher for 10 years and have had an interest in the subject since sight- ing a craft at age 9. I previously requested via the Internet that those interested in taking part in this cuurent project contact me, and Katharina Wilson has expressed an interest. Her input is valued and most wel- come, as well as a number of others. Over the past two years I have lent a friendly ear to a 32-year-old female abductee from the UK who, as well as having a long history of other medical prob- lems, has been diagnosed with M.E. (Chronic Fatigue Syndrome). Even more interesting is that she is part of a 20-member abductee group who meet once a month in London. These people are a fair cross-section of the population, and travel from all around the country to the meetings. The other day I was interested to learn that out of the 20 members of the group, 14 have been medically diagnosed with Myalgic Encephalomyelitis. As this 70% figure is extremely high, this must warrant further study. If any good is to come from this study, it is required that my investigation be meticu- lous in the way in which I gather the data and analyse it. I will endeavor to employ the help of professionals. I am open to suggestions. I feel that 500 to 1000 abductees globally would have to submit data to provide an accurate study. Comments and help in this investigation would be greatly appreciated.

Hall This issue is particularly impressive, touching as it does on all the significant areas of serious UFO research and, mercifully, containing very little on the \"sociological\" side. The focus on hard-core science and re- search includes investigation of data, methodology, investigative standards, real experimental sci- ence, and professional ethics. In order to make a point, I will comment on the content of this issue out of order, instead in the sequence standard to sci- entific inquiry. First of all, we have the basic \"data\": UFO sighting reports as represented in Richard Hall Filer's File. Although not all cases have been investi- gated, it is important to know as accurately as possible what people are reporting. Dan Wright discusses the importance of following up with meticulous investi- gation, which I strongly endorse. The field investiga- tion component of MUFON, though sometimes un- sung, is absolutely vital, and Dan sets an important standard for methodology. The people who do this work deserve recognition. Then there are abduction reports, which for the most part are very difficult to investigate scientifically and which contain strong subjective elements that can elude \"hard\" science and make it nearly impossible to find final answers. But, they CAN be studied scientifi- cally in terms of attempting to verify the physical real- ity of the reported events. Several entirely meaningful avenues of approach are possible, and here I agree wholeheartedly with the main thrust of Katharina Wilson's article. Although the idea of \"morning after\" medical tests is complicated by the fact of delayed re- call in many cases, such tests are greatly to be desired when possible. Roger Leir's work, if monitored by objective parties and subjected to standard peer review, adds very important experimental science with the potential to provide real proof. Dr. Leir's book, reviewed in model fashion by Dwight Connelly, is an unorthodox approach to making laboratory analysis results avail- able for other scientists and medical professionals to review, but given the prejudices against UFOs in the scientific community, finding a mainline scientific jour- nal to publish the results probably is out of the ques- tion. Until mainline scientists become aware of seri- ous scientific evidence, however, their prejudices will remain intact and only \"believers\" will take the find- ings seriously. It is a vicious circle. Some way needs to be found to reach the scientific community. Having been X-rayed probably a near world record number of times, and having had surgery sev- eral times, I was puzzled by the number of medical personnel needed by Dr. Leir and the extensive shield- ing required for such a relatively simple operation. Both seemed excessive, but perhaps that is related to the particular jurisdiction in question. Joe Lewels rightly emphasizes the ethical is- sues, especially the importance of keeping the abductee's welfare uppermost in mind. Many of us have observed that standard scientific investigation meth- ods do not apply well to abduction cases; a teamwork approach combining therapeutic support, scientific analysis, and detective work is required. Then there is the controversy surrounding the work of Dr. Duke. Mr. Jordan is entitled to his opinion and I am entitled to mine. Neither of our opinions mat- ters that much. Peer review is the required scientific method for resolving such controversy, and that is what I advocated. I also feel that MUFON consultants ought to review Dr. Duke's work and report on it in the Jour- nal. Then we might be closer to doing some real sci- ence in regard to his claims. MUFON member Hayes Marcel, a nephew of Lt. Col. Jesse A. Marcel, Sr., has advised that a new bronze marker has been placed on Col. Marcel's grave at the Matherne Cemetery in Houma, LA. The gov- ernment had failed to place a marker on the grave as promised, so another nephew, Issac Savoie, purchased the marker and had it installed after a 12-year delay to mark the final resting place of one of the important participants in the Roswell incident."},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal January 1999 Page 19 Case of the Month Dan Wright By Dan Wright Deputy Director, Investigations The report of a lighted object over a 24-hour period on Aug. 28-29, 1998, in Yuma, AZ, was reminiscent of too many sent to me for re- view a decade ago. Accord- ing to the field investigator trainee, several witnesses in and near the city, including two police officers and the trainee herself, observed the anomalous vehicle (possibly separate objects, given certain discrepancies in the descrip- tions) over two nights, both hovering and moving about for up to an hour at a time. With proper investi- gative follow-up, this might have proved to be one of the most important cases of the year. However, the case report consisted of only brief second- and third-hand entries attributed to each witness. There was no men- tion that personal interviews were conducted. No sight- ing forms were completed. Air traffic control personnel were apparently not contacted, nor was a request made for the police officers' incident report. State MUFON officers presumably remained unaware of the events, so they did not step in to help. As importantly, the write-up illustrated an absence of training in essential investigative procedures and report preparation. In short, an opportunity was lost. While no one did anything wrong, not enough was done right. Thus, the case report must be listed as incomplete and not entered in our computer catalog. In contrast, the basics of investigative effort have certainly not been lost on field investigator John Th- ompson of La Grange, GA. From a three-second sight- ing that others might well have passed off as not worth their time, he developed a credible argument for the appearance of a daylight disc. In the early afternoon of Sept. 25, 1998, a man was adjusting a ladder along the exterior of a house near Reel Town, AL. Directly overhead he happened to notice a shiny metallic object, probably oval in shape, at extreme altitude (estimated two to three times that of commercial air traffic) in a nearly cloudless sky. The wingless object streaked westward. In those few sec- onds, covering 60 degrees of arc before nearby trees obscured his view. With a onereighth-inch apparent; size at arm's length, its actual length may have been hundreds of feet. John interviewed the witness three days later, judging him to be articulate, serious- minded, and believable. A written account and Form 1 were completed that day. For many investigators that would have been sufficient, but John had only begun. He e-mailed NORAD and wrote to the public information office at Maxwell Air Force Base in search of a very-high-altitude aircraft. [Neither had replied as of the case report writing.] He contacted the Auburn, AL, airport, which confirmed that no westward traf- fic was in the area at that time. A local radio station was contacted but had no other witness reports. Not yet done, John communicated with three professional astronomers for their assessments. One in particular indicated that no visible meteor in bright daylight conditions had been reported in over two de- cades, that if this were one the astronomical commu- nity would have been abuzz. The other astronomers discounted the notion of a satellite (likewise not vis- ible in daylight) and an atmospheric balloon, given the great velocity described. John's case report was prepared \"by the book,\" i.e., offering witness background and detailing his in- vestigative activities, not glossing over his unsuccess- ful inquiries to the military, yet offering a sober ap- praisal why this was likely something out of the ordi- nary. Walter Sheets, state director for MUFON of Georgia, reviewed the case report and found it to be complete and compelling as written. So do I. When we step back from those enormous (ab- duction case) trees before us and look at the entire forest, it becomes clear that all incidents of genuine UFOs are really of equal value. For each is one solid link in a chain of intrusive events. We might soon learn of a close encounter involv- ing an ovular craft on the day of 9/25/98. In that cir- cumstance, this \"lightweight\" sighting will become heavy indeed.

The sighting re- port, forwarded by Michael J. Long of Mississippi UFO Files, reads: On Sunday, Nov. 29, 1998, at 7:55, a witness who asked to remain anonymous \"was at my brother's yard\" in West Memphis, Ark. \"when I looked up and saw a triangle-shaped craft flying just above the tree tops. I got a good look at it because the streetlights were shining on the bottom of the shiny silver craft. It had dim yellow lights on each corner. It was flying horizontal to the ground, and then the nose of it rose to a 45-degree angle, and it kept flying straight ahead. The craft then turned sharply to the left and disappeared behind the tree line.\" Trainor says the man added that within minutes \"several low-flying planes began cir- cling\" the area \"for 30 seconds, and then they left also,\" 12/7/98, UFO Roundup Vol. 3 #49, Joe Trainor editor, (Masinaigan@aol.com) Canadian phenomena LAKE ONTARIO—\"ORBWATCH\" is the name of a group of \"observers\" who are currently moni- toring the anomalous phenomena in the area of the west- ern end of Lake Ontario, Southern Ontario, Canada. These phenomena comprise: Unexplained aerial activ- ity in the form of \"Nocturnal Lights\" which have been seen moving over the water's surface, hovering and often submerging. At times these lights have also been seen moving under the water surface and reemerging. Unexplained aerial activity in the form of \"Diurnal Lights\" which seemingly \"appear from nowhere\" and are just \"there.\" Excellent photographs have been taken in re- cent months of the orbs, and the site was last updated on Nov. 25, 1998. They often remain in a certain spot, change shape, luminosity, height, width, and, at times, appear to have some form of solid object within the light itself. Sometimes these objects appear fifty feet above the surface.

UFO reports are coming from Melbourne, Victoria; Perth, Western Australia; Darwin, Northern Territory; Brisbane, Queensland; Canberra, Australian Capital; and Albury, New South Wales. All these reports are similar in nature. Respondents are claiming that they have sighted a very large black or dark triangular shaped object with an illuminated array underneath, descrip- tive of \"Ezekiel's wheel.\" The UFO was seen stand- ing still, rotating, and moving slowly passing overhead. Ross Dowe (ippoz@eisa.net.au) Pennsylvania light hovers A witness has reported an incident which she claims occurred at about 6:30 a.m. on the morning of Dec. 14,1998. The location of the sighting is about 10 miles from the city of Erie, and about a mile from the lake shore. The observer was unloading some items from her car when she was startled to see a bright white light with a tail that appeared to pass low directly over her head. The object was moving from N. to S. and no sound was apparent. The object continued to move to a distance of about 30 feet and stopped directly above the roof of her home. It then appeared as a solid round white light and was motionless. It then began a pattern of blinking off, then blinking on (in about one second intervals) several times. The witness became frightened at this point and ran inside, and that was the last the object was observed. The observation was short lived, with all activity occurring during the several seconds of observation. The observer's first impression was that she was watching a meteor streak through the sky, until it stopped just above her house. The witness was still bothered by the observation several days after the event. -Thanks to Stan Gordon at www.westol.com/~paufo \\."},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO Journal January 1999 Page 21 c: JOURNEY TOWARD MILLENNIUM March 19-21, 1999, Pensacola Beach, FL Gulf Breeze UFO Conference Hear famous sons Edgar Cayce, Jr. and Philip Corso, Jr., plus Whiiley Sirieber, Michael Lindemann.

(Just days prior, on the 18th, the crescent Moon joins the pair.) Though both planets stand out in the WSW, Venus (at magnitude -3.9) is about 5 times brighter than Jupiter (-2.1). Below and to the right of the two objects, look for the planet Mercury. And higher in the SW can be seen Saturn. All 4 planets can be viewed together at twilight from late February to early March. Mars (0.2), moving from Virgo to Libra, rises in the E about 1 1 PM in midmonth. It rises 3 degrees below the Moon on the 6th. Saturn (0.3), in Pisces, rides high in the SW at dusk. The ringed world sets in the W about 10:30 PM in mid-February. Bright Planets (Morning Sky): Mars stands about 30 degrees above the SSW horizon at dawn. Moon Phases: Last quarter-Feb. 8 New moon— Feb. 16 (No full moon this month) First quarter-Feb. 22 The Stars: The brilliant bluish-white star Sirius appears due S at 9 PM (mid-February) and thus is at its highest altitude above the horizon. Also dominating the south- ern sky are Orion the Hunter and the Winter Circle. In the NE Ursa Major the Great Bear, which contains the more easily seen Big Dipper, climbs the heavens. A very early hint that spring isn't far off: Leo the Lion, the celestial symbol of spring, has already appeared above the E horizon by midevening. Between the Sickle of Leo and the Twin Stars of Gemini, look for a very dim patch of light. Requiring a clear dark sky without interference from lights, this little blur is resolved with the aid of binoculars or a telescope into a wedge-shaped cluster of stars in Cancer the Crab called the Beehive. Observers in the southern states (below 38 degrees latitude) can now see the two brightest night- time stars together. Sirius, the brighter at magnitude -1.5, and Canopus (-0.7) lie one above the other and separated by only 37 degrees.

Potential nominations could also come from individuals who feel they are qualified and interested in serving MUFON and their fellow mem- bers in this vital capacity. A candidate must reside in one of the following states to be eligible: MT, WY, CO, NM, ID, UT, AZ, NV, WA, OR, CA, AK and HI. If nominating a friend or colleague, you must obtain the permission of the candidate and his/her as- surance that he/she will accept the responsibilities of the position if elected. Candidates must mail a letter, stating their rea- sons for desiring this post and their qualifications, to Walt Andrus before Jan. 30, 1999.- An election will be conducted by mail (through a bal- lot insert in the March 1999 MUFON UFO Journal to all current members in the above listed states. Since this is only one of four Board of Direc- tors elected by the membership, it is imperative that all eligible members participate and vote in the election. NEW DEPUTY DIRECTOR INVESTIGATIONS State/Provincial directors should now send their processed UFO sighting reports to Dan R. Wright at 3628 Aragon Dr., Lansing, MI 48906 instead of T. David Spencer. Dan's telephone number is (517) 327-8266. FUNDS NEEDED FOR MUFON UFO MUSEUM In 1994, when the Bigelow Foundation was providing financial help to all three members of the UFO Research Coalition, MUFON obligated itself to initiate specific new programs that we could not have financed otherwise. One of these was the MUFON UFO INFORMATION CENTER AND MUSEUM, located in an office complex on the main north-south highway Bypass 123 through Seguin, TX. This is a separate facility only a few blocks from MUFON's business office at 103 Oldtowne Road. The fundamental purpose of the \"UFO Infor- mation Center\" is public education for the general pub- lic and media, as well as UFO aficionados. This is the only UFO museum in the United Slates east of Roswell, NM. MUFON members from coast to coast and bor- der to border have visited the museum, including visi- tors from eight different countries. We do not charge admission, but solicit donations only. Obviously, the donations do not cover the monthly rent of $350 for the 500 square foot facility. After the museum was assembled in 1994, Bob Bigelow abruptly withdrew his financial support in July 1995, leaving MUFON with an additional expenditure that exceeds our annual budget. Even though our in- formation center and museum is very attractive and popular, it does not approach the tens of thousands of people who tour the International UFO Museum and Research Center in Roswell-and their donations. Over the years MUFON has received dona- tions that are I.R.S. tax deductible for the donor in their annual income tax report. These gifts are very much appreciated; however, they are far from adequate to cover the annual rent of $4200 for the museum. MUFON has never before in its nearly thirty years of operation ever solicited funds from our members to support projects. In order to keep the doors open at our museum, so as to continue to educate the public, we are taking this occasion to ask for donations. Those of you who have visited our museum recognize its importance and the unique displays. We have had photographs in the MUFON UFO Journal for those of you who haven't had the privilege of see- ing this one-of-a-kind unique display. The MUFON office acknowledges all donations or gifts of any size with a letter that you can attach as evidence to your annual income tax statement. If you want to see our UFO Information Cen- ter and Museum continue to share its displays, exhib- its, and photographs with people interested in learning more about the UFO phenomenon, this is your oppor- tunity to step forward and make a generous gift con- sistent with your financial status. May we thank you in advance for your consideration?"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"Page 24 January 1999 MUFON UFO Journal DIRECTOR'S MESSAGE Walter Andrus , NEWS FROM AROUND THE NETWORK NEW OFFICERS International Coordinator J.
