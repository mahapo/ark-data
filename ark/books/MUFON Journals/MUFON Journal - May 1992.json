By Elaine Douglass (WASHINGTON, D.C.) — A handful of enthusiasts staged the first public UFO demonstration in U.S. history in front of the White House March 28. \"Yo, yo, UFOs! The people have a right to know!\" was the chant shouted by the demonstrators. They walked in a circle and carried signs bear- ing slogans such as \"End UFO secrecy!\" Reactions from passers-by on the heavily trafficked White House sidewalk varied from friendly to indifferent. The most overt reaction came from a group of Japanese tourists who commandeered several placards and posed for pictures with unknown slogans hastily written in Japanese. Three Americans also briefly joined the demonstration before walking on. As for the demonstrators, they were elated. \"I was thrilled to participate in such an historic event,\" one demonstrator said. The Saturday afternoon demonstration culminated a week of educational, lobbying and organizing activity by the event's sponsors, Mike Jamieson of California and Ed Komarek of Georgia. Billing their efforts as \"Operation Right to Know,\" Jamieson and Komarek had arrived in the nation's capital with a truckload of UFO literature and a 30-foot banner bearing the words \"End the UFO Cover-up.\" Despite inclement weather, the two spent several days on the grassy ellipse behind the White House manning a UFO educational display which attracted the interest of numerous tourists, secret service guards, and even President George Bush. Jamieson says he is sure President Bush saw the banner on Tuesday, March 24. \"I first saw Millie, the President's dog,\" Jamieson says. \"I didn't pay much attention to the man in the orange windbreaker. Later, when I saw him walking near the White House fountain I realized it was Bush. Then I saw him look over his shoulder at our banner. Besides that, you could see the banner from the White House living quarters,\" Jamieson said. White House secret service men talked with Jamieson and Komarek several times, Jamieson says, and took literature from them. \"One of the secret service men had had a.close encounter in the Hudson Valley and he shared that with me. He saw something that was slow, quiet, with an incredible array of magical lights on it,\" Jamieson said. Asked why he came to Washington and staged the demonstration, Komarek said, \"It had to be done. I did this for everybody. The people who know what's going on have to make a stand for all the people who don't; The cover-up is political,\" Komarek continued, \"it's not a scientific prob- lem. It needs a political solution.\" Komarek, 44, is a land investor and a MUFON state section director in Georgia. Jamieson voiced similar sentiments. \"The demonstration Saturday broke the ice,\" he said. \"We need demonstrations. The news that we have off-world visitors is a political issue and talking about UFOs in public should no longer be em- barrassing.\" Jamieson, 41, is a MUFON state section direc- tor in California. He works as a psychiatric technician at Napa State Hospital in California. A New Jersey group that promised to participate failed to show up. Apart from Jamieson and Komarek, all the demonstrators March 28 were MUFON members from the Washington, D.C. area, including Mike Regimenti, Elaine Douglass, Larry Bryant, Carol Newmeyer-Spiegel, Marc Spiegel, Laurel House and one other. A total of nine demonstrators took part in the event. During the week Komarek and Jamieson distributed UFO literature to about 100 Congressional offices. Both said they were particularly impressed by the absence of ridicule and by the apparently genuine interest shown by the Senate staffs, as well as by the tourists and the White House secret service. \"I thought we'd get some heckling, but we didn't,\" Komarek said. \"People stopped for a long sober look at our educational exhibit,\" Jamieson said, \"and there was no nervous giggling.\" \"I know in my heart of hearts that the government has a lot of UFO information that would help the situation,\" said Carol Spiegel, one of the demonstrators. \"People do have a right to know and we're tired of the government covering up important issues. Someone has to stand up.\" \"I had fun,\" said Mike Regimenti, another of the demonstrators, \"and I was pleasantly surprised by the passers- by who asked pointed questions and even wanted to carry placards. A good time was had by all,\" Mike added. Future Plans It felt right. I believe it was right. As a result, Mike Jam- ieson, Ed Komarek and myself have decided to forge ahead with \"Operation Right to Know.\" Our objective is to foster public demonstrations on the issue of UFOs. Our immediate objective is to foster local demonstrations in various parts of the country. We would like to work with anyone in Gulf Breeze, in Las Vegas, or any other part of the country who would like to organize a \"Right to Know\" demonstration. We invite all persons who are interested in public demonstra- tions on UFOs to get in touch with us immediately. Write: Mike Jamieson, 554 Randolph St., Apt. 2, Napa, CA 94559.

April 13th, 1992 > By George WingfieW W e had never visited Washington, D.C., previously and had arrived at National Airport at 4:20 p.m. that after- noon. My wife Gloria and I had flown from Raleigh/Durham, N.C., and were met by Susan Webster, who is also English, but who has lived near the city for many years. Although we had corresponded neither of us had met Susan until that day. She drove us from the airport and pointed out many of the landmarks in the city. The weather was bright and sunny with hardly a cloud in the sky. We stopped the car by the Tidal Basin of the Potomac to wander in the sun and look at the cherry blossom which was at its finest. I suggested that we walk to the Washington Monu- ment which entailed crossing two busy roads which we managed with difficulty. There were dozens of tourists there, mostly in a straggly line round the base waiting to ascend the inside of the great obelisk. Enquiry indicated that we would have to wait 45 minutes if we wished to go up in the elevator. I took several photos of the 555 ft. high monument with my Canon Autofocus camera. Just as we were leaving the monument I said that I must get a photo of the White House from this vantage point and crossed to one side to do this. However this photograph was never taken for, as I walked, I glanced up again towards the apex of the great pillar. Over the top of the monument, travel- ling silently towards the west at great altitude was a bright disk. As if this was not astonishing enough there followed behind it a small fleet of seven lesser objects also shining brilliantly as they swept silently above the obelisk. Although there was no way of telling, these all appeared to be at a substantial altitude, say 30,000 ft. or so. This estimate is based on com- parison with jet aircraft at similar altitudes but it was quite plain that these were not aircraft. The large disk-shaped ob- ject must have subtended an angle of about one quarter the diameter of the full moon (7 minutes of arc). Gloria and Susan immediately saw what I was pointing at and watched the objects moving silently above. I motioned to several people standing by the monument who also looked up but most showed only limited interest or comprehension of what they were looking at. I found a boy with some binoculars nearby and borrowed them to look at the leading object. Adjusting the focus with some difficulty, I was able to see that this object appeared translucent and circular. By now the smaller objects had faded and only one or two re- mained in sight. Possibly their initial brightness was caused by reflection of sunlight from them in the position in which we had first spotted them. All of them had wheeled above us and were now receding again towards the east, in the direc- tion of the Capitol. Soon only the large disk could be seen in the sky, now dwindling in size as it flew away from us. Then Gloria and Susan both saw a further small object, apparently much lower, flying rapidly westward. Before it went behind the monument it halted in flight, flew back again, reversed westward and brightened suddenly, changing to an orange color, before apparently vanishing in thin air. This ob- ject I could not see, despite looking along Gloria's outstret- ched arm in the direction indicated. E arlier a boy had asked me what the first circular object in the sky was. \"That,\" I said, \"is a UFO.\" He looked somewhat puzzled. I attempted two photographs with my Canon camera. One shows the Washington monument and the tiniest white dot imaginable which may or may not be the disk. The other was not printed and one tan see that the negative shows nothing but blank sky. By 6 p.m., perhaps 15 minutes after the initial sighting the largest object had faded to a minute dot and was eventually lost to sight. We then headed back towards the Tidal Basin where the car was parked. Excited and bewildered by this totally unex- pected sighting, we felt almost honoured by this peculiar flypast. Then a further object appeared flying roughly on a course from the Capitol towards the Pentagon which was not visible from where we stood. This object seemed to drift silently across the sky changing shape as it did so. At first it looked to be shaped like a cross, then perhaps a cigar, then like an airplane viewed from above. But this was clearly not an airplane and the only conceivable object which it resembled would have been an enormous irregular cluster of balloons strung together and tumbling across the sky. If it was that, it would have been bizarre enough, but it was followed at a distance by a smaller object like those which had previously followed the disk. This object shone like the others but occasionally let out a bright flash, though it was impossible to say whether this was due to the sun catching on a reflective surface. In all we had seen 11 objects cross the sky, none of which behaved like any conventional flying object which one might have expected to see during the daytime. During all this time commercial jets had been fly- ing in and out of National Airport though these were in a different part of the sky. Although all three of us have travelled to many different parts of the world, none of us had ever seen anything like what we saw on that day before. I have seen a few strange objects in the sky, most often at night, but have never been sufficiently sure that they were not something of a conven- tional origin.to classify them as UFOs. On that Monday after- noon in Washington D.C. that was the only description that fitted the bizarre objects which we had observed. On countless occasions people have asked why, if UFOs exist, don't they just come down and land beside the White House. On April 13th it really looked for a time as if they would do just that.

Dennis Stacy T he 25 April 1992 issue of New Scientist (p. 5) reveals that Japanese scientists have successfully raised a goat fetus inside an artificial womb. Well, sort of ... Earlier this year Yoshinori Kuwabara, a gynecologist in the medical department of Tokyo Universi- ty, removed a fetus from its mother after 120 days of gesta- tion (about three-quarters into full term for a goat), and placed it inside a man-made rubber womb filled with artificial am- niotic fluid. Seventeen days later, the kid was \"delivered.\" \"A goat fetus is very immature, even at 120 days,\" said Kuwabara. \"It corresponds to about the 20th to 24th week of gestation of a human fetus.\" The goat fetus was fed via a catheter, through which nor- mal fetal blood, oxygenated and recycled, was pumped. Nutrients were added. The internal rubber sac was filled with a near exact reproduction of natural amniotic fluid, consisting of sodium and potassium chlorides, glucose and proteins. Temperature was kept at a constant 39.5 degrees Centigrade by passing warm water through two outer layers of rubber. As early as 1969, according to New Scientist, French ex- perimenters had been able to keep a sheep fetus alive for two days in a similar device. (I kid you not.) Kuwabara's solution had to confront two pressing problems. Since the 42-liter sac was a good deal larger than the normal goat's, the fetus could move around more freely, thereby run- ning the risk of taking in too much oxygen (toxic at high con- centrations) or swallowing too much amniotic fluid. To slow down its activities, Kuwabara and colleagues fed the fetus sedatives. The gynecologist said his research had two objectives: \"One is for animal models for fetal experimental medicine. The other is for clinical use, to rescue very immature or sick fetuses. \"I don't worry about the ethical problems,\" he added. \"I just want to rescue the fetus where it is impossible to be rescued by present treatment.\" Kuwabara thinks it may be possible to artifically incubate a goat's fetus as early as 90 days into gestation, and a human's as early as the 16th week. And Kuwabara's kid? A month after being \"born,\" it still can't stand or breathe on its own, side-effects of the muscle relaxants which are slowly wearing off. Otherwise, he said, it's \"doing well.\" S ome implications for the standard abduction hypothesis are obvious. It seems odd, to say the least, that an ad- vanced intelligence capable of spanning star systems should be reduced to the crude gynecological procedures related by most abductees. If our own 20th century medical technology is now on the verge of both artificial insemination and in- cubation, it's clear that any highly advanced society should be equally advanced in this area as well. Any extraterrestrial abductors, in other words, should be able to initiate and main- tain a massive genetic hybridization program without the repeated physical kidnapping of individuals. The latter simply no longer \"makes sense\" - either in simply logical or coldly scientific terms, or, for that matter, on a cost-efficiency basis. A million or more abductions are simply not required by any intelligent agency that can supposedly \"beam\" people through solid objects. It's time to seriously analyze and re-think the \"standard\" abduction scenario, the proponents of which are often fond of quoting Arthur C. Clarke to the effect \"that future technology will resemble magic.\" That may be true, but the gynecological horror stories we are hearing have nothing magical about them. In fact, in another century, if terrestrial science continues on its own current course, they will sound like nothing so much as the outmoded technology of the medieval Dark Ages. FORRESTAL'S FALL W e've touched on the strange, sad story of James For- restal in these pages before (see \"The UFO Press,\" August 1991, No. 280). Forrestal, you may remember, was President Truman's (indeed, the nation's) first Secretary of Defense. He was also the third member of MJ-12 listed in the controversial \"Majic\" documents. On May 22, 1949, he jumped to his death from the 16th floor of the Bethesda Naval Hospital. Now there is a new biography of Forrestal, Driven Patriot, by Townsend Hoopes and Douglas Brinkley, illus., 587 pp. (Alfred Knopf, $30). David Callahan, reviewing it in the New York Times Book Review (May 3, 1992, p. 11), calls it \"an illuminating and at times haunting book that will surely stand as the definitive account of James Forrestal's triumphant, yet tragic, life.\" The authors are a former Under Secretary of the Air Force and an assistant professor of history at Hofstra University, respectively. They refer to Forrestal as the \"god- father of the national security state.\" Prior to assuming the top Pentagon post in September of 1947, he had been Secretary of the Navy, having succeeded the late Frank Knox in April of 1944. The Roswell crash reportedly occurred in early July of 1947, and some con- spiratorialists have concluded that it was the revelations glean- ed from Roswell about alien visitors that contributed to For- restal's subsequent suicide. Hoopes and Brinkley, however, note that by then Forrestal was already described by one close friend as \"a burned-out case.\" MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 289 May 1992"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"FRENCH FLAP GOES LARGELY UNNOTICED By Jean Sider and Irena Scott While Belgium enjoys the spotlight, France is inundated with UFOs I nformation about the Belgium UFO sightings, e.g., Inter- national UFO Reporter, 7/8, 1991, might cause one to wonder whether this phenomenon is confined solely to the national boundaries of Belgium or if similar events have taken place in neighboring countries. The following reported in- cidents, which may represent the greatest UFO flap in France since Autumn of 1954, may provide the answer. On 5 Nov. 1990, a sudden increase in reports of uniden- tified aerial phenomena occurred in almost all of France. A preliminary analysis of more than 100 reports showed sim- ilarities to the Belgium (11/90 - 5/91) flap. However, the French events occurred over a shorter time-frame. Reports were collected by the following agencies: 1) SE- PRA, Service d'Expertise des Phenomenes de Rentrees At- mospheriques (an ex-GEPAN official department working on UFO sightings for the CNES, a sort of \"little NASA\"), col- lected more than 2000 reports (La Depeche du Midi, Toulouse, 11-7-1990); SOSOVNI (a private UFO group located in Aix- en-Provence) collected several hundred reports; 3) BIDU (another private UFO group located in Chatillon) collected several hundred reports; 4) LDLN (also a private associa- tion, located in Bretigny s/Orge), collected more than 100 reports. This indicates a sizeable UFO flap generating many wit- nesses, when one considers that some UFO researchers believe that only one in ten events are reported. The potential total sightings may have been as great as 30,000. Also, because these events occurred suddenly, they are unlikely to have been media generated. The following synthesis of the phenomena was based on over 100 reports from the national press and provincial newspapers. The main shape was triangular; however some \"structures\" looked like diamonds and others were sphere- shaped. (In one report the object had a variable geometry — it was first viewed as a triangle formed by several bright lights, then transformed itself into an enormous sphere). The object(s) was of enormous size, estimated to be from 25 to over 100 meters in length (82 to 328 ft.), and from 10 to 50 meters in width (33 to 164 ft.). Others reported even larger dimensions. It traveled at a very low altitude, under the clouds, between 50 and 1000 meters (164 to 3280 ft.). In general, most witnesses reported a very slow speed; however, others reported rapid or alternating slow and rapid speeds. Several witnesses reported a vertical assent with a lashing motion. Almost all witnesses reported soundlessness. The object displayed flashing bright lights, varying in size, color, brightness and number. Very often one or two spotlights illuminated the area back of the phenomenon. Many reported that it left a luminous furrow of \"white smoke\" or \"conden- sation.\" There were no reports of a radar echo and no in- frared tracks on the radar screens of Air Force bases or civil airports. The sightings occurred chiefly between 6:45 p.m. and 7:15 p.m. with a few cases before and after these hours. One observation reported by an astronomer was on 6 Nov. between 2:00 and 3:00 a.m. The geographical distribution of the sightings was in two general directions: Nantes-Colmar (West-East) and Nantes- Perigueux (North-South). But a few witnesses reported East to West and South to North directions. According to Mr. Jean- Jacques Velasco, Chief of SEPRA, all the country provided reports except the area of Marseille (South-Eastern France), according to La Depeche du Midi (7/11/90). Many witnesses were well qualified observers, including civil and Air Force pilots, Navy personnel, policemen, engineers, technicians, employees, tradespeople and students. For example, personnel aboard the Navy warship, the \"Jean Bart,\" near Lorient in the Atlantic ocean, reported an enor- mous triangle with bright lights, moving slowly and noiselessly under the clouds. No radar echo or infrared track was visi- ble on their radar. Several explanations for these reports were advanced. One was that it was a meteor. However, Mr. Velasco of SEPRA claimed on TV that the meteorite hypothesis was ruled out (A.2. 1:00p.m., 8 Nov. 1990). F-117A aircraft had been ad- vanced to explain the Belgian flap in Science and Vie, No. 877 (Oct. 1990). Consequently some newspapers chose this hypothesis to explain the French events, for example L'Humanite (7 Nov. 1990), a Communist daily newspaper. The latter may have proposed this explanation because they were opposed to the military position of the U.S. against Iraq. Another explanation was that of space debris re-entry. However, Mr. J. C. Ribes, an astrophysicist at the Lyons Observatory, ruled out the meteorite and space debris re-entry explanations, but did not rule out the UFO hypothesis (FR. 3, 10:20 p.m., 1 Nov. 1990). A n informant in the Ministry of Defense believed that the authorities were baffled by the situation because of the numerous reports from Air Force and Navy staff, and because the phenomenon was sighted under the clouds. They used a press release under the auspices of CNES to announce that the sightings were caused by the re-entry of a Soviet first stage rocket, the one which launched the satellite Gorizont on 21, Oct. 1990 (A.2. 1:00p.m., 9 Nov. 1990). However several facts were inconsistent with this explana- tion. An astronomer working for the Institute of Radio- astronomy on the Bure plateau near St. Etienne-en-Devoluy (Hautes-Alpes district), Mr. Andre Rambaud, was on duty that night about 7:00 p.m. He did not see anything unusual at the hour of the sightings, but between 2 and 3:00 a.m., he sighted three green, yellow and red lights moving together MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 289 May 1992"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"that he was not able to explain according to Le Dauphinee Libere, (Grenoble, 7 Nov. 1990). What is of importance here is that he did not observe anything at 7:00 p.m. He was in an ideal location (1300 meters in altitude) watching the sky. If a Russian rocket had fallen from a high altitude over France on a West to East trajectory from Nantes to Colmar about 7:00 p.m., he should have seen it. Another informant obtained the text of the NASA dispatch sent to CNES about the Soviet re-entry. It claimed that a multiple-stage Russian rocket had disappeared from orbit on 5 Nov. 1990, but gave no indication of the hour or the loca- tion of the re-entry. This information did not come from NORAD. Further investigation of these events was done in the U.S. and consisted of a review of newspaper and magazine articles published outside of France, along with a review of NASA, and other data bases and information sources. A U.S. Space Command source said that a Russian rocket body had been predicted to impact the Mid-Atlantic region at 2:35 p.m. 11/5/90. He said that their predictions are 92% accurate and that the probability range was plus or minus 20 minutes. He said it could re-enter at an angle and skip on the Earth's at- mosphere, but that this would delay the re-entry by a matter of minutes, not hours. He did not have any information on whether the rocket actually re-entered at this time or about whether there were any observers. Thus, no evidence existed to prove that the French reports were of a space object re-entry. In comparison to these French reports, recently published information about stealth technology (Popular Science, 12/91 and the MUFON UFO Journal, 1/92) shows three main types of craft: one with a wingspan between 60 and 160 feet across; the second has been described as a high-flying yellow or orange light with a loud pulsing roar, and the third has been described as a black boomerang 600 to 800 feet across. It appears that the French descriptions show a soundless object that is longer than wide, as opposed to most depic- tions of stealth aircraft as having a wingspan wider than its length and as emitting sound. In addition, descriptions of stealth technology suggest that particular types of stealth air- craft are not capable of alternately slow and fast speeds, but instead each craft is specialized for particular speeds. For ex- ample the F-117A (Gulf War Stealth) is believed to be limited to approximately 500 m.p.h. or below. Although this could be the greatest French UFO flap since the one of 1954, most of the reports gathered by SEPRA will remain unknown by researchers because this department works for CNES. In addition, the private associations general- ly don't publish their reports. Consequently, one of the largest possible UFO flaps in French history may remain for the most part unpublished and unknown.

Greer, M.D. Copyright 1992 Introduction ON February 5th 1992, members of the Center for the Study of Extraterrestrial Intelligence (CSETI) executive commit- tee departed for Europe to investigate the current wave of UFO sightings in Belgium. The purpose of this trip was to con- duct first hand research of this extraordinary UFO wave, to interview principle witnesses, to meet with the primary in- vestigators at SOBEPS and to conduct on site CE-5 Initiative research. (The CE-5 Initiative - or Close Encounters of the Fifth Kind initiative — is a CSETI research project which uses protocols to voluntarily interact with UFOs/Extrater- restrial Intelligence.) All of these goals were met with suc- cess, and we left Belgium convinced that this UFO wave is one of the most significant and well documented ones in UFO history. Here I wish to personally thank the many gracious and helpful people at SOBEPs (Societe Beige d'Etude des Phenomenes Spatiaux), Belgium's principle UFO research organization, without whose assistance none of these goals could have been met. At SOBEPS, Patrick Ferryn, Lucien Clerebaut, Dr. Leon Brenig and Professor Auguste Meessen as well as many others gave of their time and were of im- mense help to our efforts: The integrity, kindness and pro- fessional quality of the people at SOBEPS serves as an in- spiring example to UFO researchers everywhere. A special thanks also to Mr. Nicoll, the gendarme who, along with his fellow police officer, first saw these large triangular UFOs near Eupan, Belgium on November 29, 1989. Mr. Nicoll generously spent an entire afternoon sharing his experiences and observations with us, escorted us to all of the sites where his observations were made and showed us every kindness and courtesy. O n Saturday, February 8, 1992, we met with SOBEPS investigators at their headquarters in Brussels. Here, we were able to interview witnesses, receive an ex- cellent overview and briefing from Patrick Ferryn and make a presentation regarding the CSETI CE-5 Initiative and its applications in Belgium. During our meetings it became clear that the Belgian wave was ideally suited for engaging in serious real time UFO research using interactive CE-5 Initiative pro- tocols. To our great satisfaction, we learned that Dr. Brenig and others were organizing research observation teams to engage in real time research, and the day we arrived were making plans to place these teams in areas around the coun- try to achieve direct scientific observation of the UFOs. To their already excellent plans we made the additional sugges- tion that they encourage team members to go beyond passive observation and to actively engage these spacecraft using light signals, sound and coherent thought sequencing. These sug- gestions were enthusiastically received, and it is hoped that we will soon be hearing of Close Encounters of the Fifth Kind in Belgium. Summary Findings From Interviews and Briefings Below follows a brief summary of the salient features of the current UFO wave in Belgium, and of our interviews with various UFO witnesses and investigators. The current wave began on November 29, 1989 at 5:24 p.m. when police officer Nicoll and his fellow officer were on patrol near Eupan in eastern Belgium. There, they saw at close range a large triangular shaped aircraft with three bright lights, one at each corner and a large red-orange pulsating light in the center of the craft. This object, and another like it, were observed for approximately three hours as it glided over various areas near Eupan. To adequately describe this case would require at least a long chapter in a book; in lieu of that, we must be content with the following summary: T he UFO was seen at close range, was a structured craft over 100 feet and possibly over 200 feet in length, and was completely silent. • There were multiple other police and civilian witnesses to the UFO. • The UFO glided over the land, following the contour in a constant fashion, and emitted a laser like red light parallel to the land which would stop at limited distances (!) in space as if measuring something on or under the ground. The UFO would stop and go while it did this. • The UFO hovered at close range over a field and emitted a brilliant blue-white light many times more brilliant than that of a helicopter search light. • The craft was initially moving away from Eupan, but when the officers started to pursue it, it changed directions; the of- ficers were armed and it may be that the UFO took this in- itial evasive action because of the presence of weapons. • The officers then followed this UFO at a distance through the countryside near Eupan, until they arrived at a small chapel along a dirt road. Here they observed the UFO hover over the Gileppe Dam, then descend below the ridge apparent- ly to hover directly over the water of the dam. • At this point the two officers saw a large second UFO rise directly from a ravine very near to their location. It was \"huge,\" within 300 feet, brightly lit, and a lit dome could be seen on top of the triangular craft. Again no sound was heard. The UFO then departed towards Henri-Chapelle where other police officers saw the craft. MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 289 May 1992"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"• Mr. Nicoll felt no fear, but was amazed and dumbfounded by the experience. He insists that it was a real, structured physical aircraft, completely silent even at close range, and unlike any known human aircraft. Mr. Nicoll is highly credi- ble, sincere and he and the other witnesses are unimpeachable. • Mr. Nicoll personally took us to each of these sites, and we can attest that from his descriptions, this triangular craft was large and at close range. Mr. Nicoll relates that he feels this craft was on some sort of technical mission relating to the measurement of the land or subterranean features of the area. We later learned that this area has many old, presently inactive volcanic sites, geological fault lines and old hot spring sites, and that the region is occasionally rocked by earthquakes. We also learned that there are nearby nuclear weapons bases as well as a nuclear power plant in not-so-distant Tihange (more on this later). Other General Findings • Belgium, which has 10 million people but is only one- third the size of Indiana, has had over 3500 UFO sightings since November 1989; remember that some of these 3500 cases have had hundreds of witnesses and that a large number of these cases are multiple witness cases by highly credible people. • Most cases involve a large triangular-shaped craft, but other craft have been seen as well, including rectangular plat- forms, disc-shaped craft and others. • There have been no humanoid sightings, nor have there been any Close Interactions (so-called 'abductions') by humanoids. • The Belgian Air Force is cooperating with civilian re- searchers and has given them technical and logistical assistance, including the use of magnifying infrared night scopes, Air Force observation towers and joint airborne research efforts. Neither their Air Force nor NATO can ex- plain these craft as terrestrial in origin. It should be noted that NATO, with its large U.S. military influence, has been less cooperative and forthcoming concerning these events, even though at least one NATO nuclear air base has been overflown at low altitude by one of these UFOs. • There is at least one clear picture of this UFO which has been shown to be authentic and which conforms with the description of the UFO given by police and military person- nel. There are video tapes of the UFO which are of a lesser quality. • There have been more than one multiple radar/visual con- firmation of this UFO. On the night of March 30-31, 1990, the UFO was tracked on four separate Belgian NATO radar stations as well as an F-16 on-board radar (the F-16 was scrambled to pursue the UFO which was also seen visually from the ground by multiple witnesses). In addition, other radar/visual sightings have occurred, one as recently as December of 1991 when a commercial pilot, ground control radar and ground-based witnesses all saw the UFO at low altitude. The radar tape of the March 1990 sighting has been analyzed by Professor Meessen and is considered hard evidence of an extraordinary craft with non-terrestrial per- formance characteristics. • There have been several Close Encounters of the Fifth Kind in Belgium. Notably, in one case several Belgium military members saw a large triangular UFO at close range. The UFO was moving away from the group when one of the men decided to try flashing a flash light towards the craft. At this point, the craft stopped, came closer and signaled back to the man in the same sequence as that sent by the man. This interactive exchange, initiated by the human observer, continued for about 30 minutes and constitutes a significant CE-5 with multiple witnesses. • Although there have been a few daylight sightings, as well as sightings at all hours of the night, most of the sightings occurred between 5 p.m. and 9 p.m., often in full view of dozens if not hundreds of people. • Sightings have occurred throughout Belgium but are con- centrated along a river valley which extends from Eupan in the east of Belgium to Liege, Tihange and Mons. C ontrary to what a number of arm-chair speculators in the U.S. and elsewhere have claimed, there is no evidence that these sightings are due to secret U.S. aircraft, nor did we meet any military or civilian scientists or first hand observers who felt this. Moreover, given the secret handling of state-of-the-art aircraft in the U.S., it is not plausible that the U.S. military would fly such secret and experimental weapons over densely populated areas in the early evening hours when many people would be out to observe them. We spoke to no scientists or observers who felt that these craft were of a terrestrial origin. There are several cases where apparent 'transluminal'/ telepathic capacities are demonstrated. We interviewed a young man at length who had an extraordinary experience while driving home in the early evening hours last year. At some distance from his home he observed a UFO which was only several hundred feet or less in altitude. The UFO was ahead of where this man was going, and he was amazed when the UFO turned in advance of his actions. That is, before the man would turn his car onto a new road to go home, the UFO would turn first, as if leading him to his house. He felt that the UFO was able to 'read his mind' in advance of each turn, and the UFO continued to 'lead' him home, turning precise- ly at each intersection. Finally, he arrived home to find the UFO hovering at a very low altitude (50-100 feet) above his house. He called to his wife, who came out of the house and also saw the air- craft. While the man was unafraid, his wife became very frightened, and at this point the UFO left the area. An almost identical case was reported by a veterinarian who MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 289 May 1992"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"was driving to her home not far from the Tihange nuclear power plant. Again, the UFO anticipated her every turn precisely, and was hovering over her house upon her arrival. The UFO was observed by her husband and son at the house. It is not known whether such events, which have been reported elsewhere around the world, indicate the presence of Technology Assisted Consciousness on board the craft, in- nate mental capabilities of the occupants, or both. These UFOs have been observed near nuclear military in- stallations and nuclear power plants. Of particular interest is the remarkable sighting near the Tihange nuclear facility which involved numerous UFOs seen throughout the evening in the vicinity of the town near the nuclear plant. There have been multiple sightings in this area over the past two years, but on one evening virtually the entire town was awakened to loud booms coming from these slow moving aircraft as several of them roamed the area and converged on the nuclear reactor. Witnesses stated that these UFOs appeared to be mak- ing these loud booming noises to intentionally draw people out of their houses to see the huge triangular objects. This particular incident lasted several hours and was witnessed by hundreds of people at close range (100s of feet). Summary of CE-5 Initiative Research As mentioned earlier, one of the purposes of the trip was to engage in real time research in the area of peak UFO ac- tivity while using CE-5 Initiative research techniques. With this in mind, after completing our initial investigations with SOBEPS in Brussels, we headed for Eupan. Here, we were briefed by Mr. Nicoll, shown the areas around Eupan where these objects have been seen, and with the assistance of Mr. Nicoll secured a strategic field for our night research pro- gram. There we were joined by two SOBEPS members who brought with them the Air Force magnifying infrared night scope. At about 8:30 p.m. on Sunday, February 9th we gathered in the pre-arranged field, and, braving cold, rain, wind and seemingly endless mud, began our research and observations. Using high powered search lights, specific UFO related auditory tones (played from our cars' stereo system via cassette tape) and coherent thought sequencing, we began our CE-5 Initiative research. Observations were hampered by the weather which was certainly less than ideal, and which was intermittent driving rain with periods of relative clearing with only scattered low clouds. Then, at approximately 8:50 p.m. Belgian time, we noticed towards the southeast several bright white lights hovering above a ridge on the other side of Eupan. This ridge was traversed by a road which led into Eupan and had been the location of a number of UFO sightings in the past. At this point, the weather had cleared somewhat, and with the infrared scope I was able to clearly see first one and then up to eight UFOs hovering above the ridge. These lights were several miles away and no distinct craft was seen. However, their movement defied any prosaic explanations, and at times these lights would move in a circular fashion, reverse their direction, and appear to merge with one another. After 5-10 minutes of these observations, one of the UFOs signaled back to us in the same sequence which we had used to signal to them. These observations continued for about 30 minutes, at which time the weather became unfavorable for further observations. Later, while the area was still rather foggy, we saw lower lights which moved in a repeating fashion; these turned out only to be distant cars traversing the ridge road to Eupan. Earlier, however, the UFO lights were seen while it was clear, and they were well above the ridge and moving in a distinctly anomalous manner. F rom there we proceeded to the area on the dirt road where Mr. Nicoll and his partner observed the UFO rising from the ravine at close range. There we con- tinued our CE-5 techniques. A rather strange event occurred there which we cannot adequately explain: While we were looking over the area near the ravine, we saw four or five small white lights, which we assumed to be fluorescent street lights of some sort. These were bright white and located just over the area of trees on the other side of the ravine, but clearly in the field and no more than 300 feet away. While we had not seen any light poles or wires in that area during our in- spection earlier in the day, we assumed that we had simply not observed them. Then at approximately 12:30 a.m., all of the lights disappeared, as if a switch had been thrown and all of the lights turned off at once. We were momentarily amazed at this, but then tentatively concluded that these lights were on a timer of some sort and went off automatically at that hour of the morning. To confirm this theory, we returned to the same site the next morning, but were astonished to find that no such lights existed, and that the field in question was devoid of any lights, poles or wires. Later we learned from Dr. Brenig that others have observed blue-white and red lights in association with these UFOs. At the time of our observation of these lights, it was very overcast with a low cloud ceiling, and no obser- vation above a few hundred feet was possible. The next night we returned to this area with Dr. Brenig, but saw no lights in the area where they were seen the previous night. On the night of February 10, 1992, we proceeded with Dr. Brenig to a high ridge near the town of Henri-Chapelle, about 10 miles from Eupan. There we continued our observations and CE-5 research, and shared information and ideas with Dr. Brenig. About 10 p.m. we observed a convoy of military/official vehicles carrying a white canister on the back of a flat bed truck. This truck was escorted by several other vehicles with flashing yellow warning lights. It was obvious that the cargo in question was a hazardous material of some sort which required a high degree of security. The road over which this material was being transported was rather deserted at that hour of the night. Dr. Brenig left around 11 p.m. to return to Brussels, where he had an early class to teach at the university. We continued to remain at this site for several more hours, and at around MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 289 May 1992"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"12:30-1 a.m. observed another, even longer convoy of vehicles moving in the opposite direction on the same road, again carrying a canister under tight security. This convoy appeared to be between '/4 and '/2 mile in length and at this hour the road was virtually deserted of any other traffic. While observing this event, we noticed through a break in the clouds a bright, large yellow-white light appear, which moved slowly and was larger than the full moon. It should be noted that we could see the moon through thin clouds in the opposite direction from this other light. This light was in the clouds over the area of the transport convoy, and was soon obscured by rapidly moving clouds. A few minutes later, after the convoy had moved out of sight, we heard — and felt — a deep vibratory rumble directly over our car which lasted 10-30 seconds. This vibration was coming from the clouds directly overhead (the ceiling of clouds was very low from our position on the ridge). It was unlike anything any of us had ever heard; it certainly was not the distant rumble of thunder or jets, nor was it a sonic boom. Each of us felt that this sound was emanating from an im- mense and powerful object directly overhead in the clouds — like a million transformers humming almost to a roar or boom. It should be noted that this sound did not appear to be com- ing from a moving object, and that a second episode of vibratory rumbling occurred shortly after the first one. We all felt that it was associated with the mysterious light previous- ly observed, and that it emitted this sound once overhead to let us know it was there, because it could not safely descend below the very low cloud cover. Indeed, it appeared to be a sound which was intentionally turned on, then off, then on again, and reminded us of the case relayed to us by Dr. Brenig of the multiple UFOs over the nuclear power plant at Tihange. Could there be a connection between the high security con- voy, the light, the vibratory rumble/roar and the events which occurred over Tihange? We have reason to think so. Conclusions, Correlations and Reflections The Belgian UFO wave continues to this day, and is one of the most important UFO events in history. It involves multi- ple credible witnesses, police and military confirmation, radar evidence, CE-5s, photographic evidence and government cooperation with civilian research efforts. • The main body of these reports indicate the presence of extraterrestrial spacecraft over Belgium. No conventional, pro- saic or secret 'stealth' aircraft can account for the facts of this UFO wave. • The events occurring in Belgium provide an excellent real time laboratory for studying the UFO phenomenon and for performing CE-5 Initiative Research. The probability of hav- ing close range interactive experiences with these spacecraft and perhaps their occupants is deemed high if a concerted research effort can be maintained. CSETI plans to return to Belgium in the summer of 1992 to further these goals. • Why Belgium? Belgium is NATO headquarters; it has numerous nuclear facilities and bases; some of these facilities may be in areas of possible future geologic activity; Belgium is quickly becoming the economic capital of the new unified European Community; Belgium is strategically located; its people are gracious and are unusually open-minded; the peo- ple of Belgium have reacted to this phenomenon intelligent- ly, with governmental honesty and in a non-hysterical and non-hostile manner. Why is this UFO Wave occurring at this point in time? Perhaps the fall of the Berlin Wall in the fall of 1989 — when the current wave began — holds the key to this question. The collapse of the East Bloc and the Warsaw Pact, the dissolu- tion of the Soviet Empire and the unification of Europe are all temporally related to this wave. While generally positive developments, all of these events have a high potential for geopolitical instability in the short term, and would under- standably attract the attention of any extraterrestrial group observing the planet. We also note that NASA has confirmed the existence of a much larger than expected ozone hole in the atmosphere over this part of the world, and this may be both a spatial and temporal determinant of this wave, as well as the nearby crop circle phenomenon in southern England (see below). W hat are these spacecraft doing in the Belgian area? They appear to be involved with three major areas of activity in Belgium: 1) Technical geological surveillance. Many of the best and most thorough reports indicate that these objects are doing some type of measurements of the Belgian terrain/geology. This activity has been observed in areas of geological faults, dormant volcanoes and dormant hot springs. As mentioned before, these areas are near various nuclear facilities. 2) Observation/tracking of nuclear materials and facilities. Over-flight of NATO nuclear facilities, the multiple sight- ings in and around Tihange nuclear facility, our own obser- vations on February 10, 1992 and other cases lend support to this idea. 3) Social reaction experimentation. Like the large UFO wave in the early and mid-1980s in the Hudson Valley NY area, the current wave in Belgium often involved low level sightings in heavily populated areas during the early evening hours when large numbers of people are outside and in a posi- tion to observe these UFOs. Many people we talked with had the distinct impression that the occupants of these UFOs were intentionally allowing large numbers of people to see them. This may serve several inter-related functions: To observe human social, governmental, military and individual reac- tion to their presence; and to educate and condition large numbers of people and governments around the world to their presence (by doing this in Belgium, which is NATO head- quarters and the center of Europe, large numbers of people and various governments are systematically exposed to them in a gradual yet undeniable way). We believe they are also possibly awaiting an affirmative response from the non-military sector of society.

That we cannot fully explain such events must not serve as grounds for rejecting valid em- pirical evidence. Further Correlations At the risk of incurring the wrath of UFO researcher and debunker alike, I must state that we believe there may be a connection between the crop circles of southern England and the Belgian UFO wave. Consider: While crop circles have been reported for centuries (as have UFOs), the time period of the UFO wave in Belgium — 1989 to the present — cor- responds temporally with the growth in both the number and complexity of crop circles in southern England. Spatially, the correlation is obvious to anyone who looks at a map of Europe since these two remarkable events are separated by only two or three hundred aerial miles. These events in Belgium are due east of the southern England crop circles and both events have been occurring just north of the 50th parallel north and in the vicinity of the alarmingly large ozone hole over Europe (which we found incredibly polluted even by U.S. standards!). The two seemingly unrelated events both involve strong evidence witnessed by thousands of people locally and millions of people worldwide via the media. They are both temporally and spatially related. And both the crop circles and the Belgian UFO wave provide strong evidence for the interaction with planet earth by an intelligence at once enigmatic and real. But perhaps what is most extraordinary about both 'waves' is that they could be occurring in such close proximity to one another and yet be regarded as separate and unrelated events! It is as if 3500 sightings of UFOs had occurred in eastern North Carolina while at the same time hundreds of complex pictograms appeared in western North Carolina — and all the while the human observers and researchers assumed the events to be unrelated. Indeed, they may be, but we assume this blindly at great risk, and I for one would encourage a hard look at these correlations in the chance that we may un- cover something most profound. In closing, I wish to add that these investigations have shown us the great value of — and need for — close international cooperation and the exchange of ideas and information. It is our hope at CSETI that we may facilitate this sharing pro- cess and thereby bring us closer to the comprehensive understanding which we all seek.

This feature is apparently going to be used only occasionally (perhaps bi- monthly) in future issues of the magazine. The February 1 issue of the weekly magazine SCIENCE NEWS reported on astronomer Gerald S. Hawkins' research into the \"crop circles\" and \"pictograms\" which have appeared in England. Hawkins finds what he considers to be very significant — and previously unknown — geometric theorems in the patterns which have been formed in grain fields. Hawkins is perhaps best known for his books STONEHENGE DECODED, BEYOND STONEHENGE and MINDSTEPS TO THE COSMOS. The March 7 issue of the magazine presented a large selection of letters from readers comment- ing on the \"circles\" theories, along with a response from Hawkins.

Levengood, Marshall Dudley and Michael Chorost Prepared by Linda Moulton Howe T hese instructions are intended primarily for people sampl- ing crop circles in America and Canada. English samplers will hopefully find them useful in a general sense as well. It is important that samplers call us first before going out to sample a crop circle. The situation with regard to available labs and equipment will be changing throughout the summer, so samplers need to get up-to-date information from us. Below are telephone numbers to call. Call the number closest to you and explain your particular situation. The contact person will help you decide whether to collect soil or plant samples, or both, will give you detailed instructions for sampling, and will tell you where to send the samples. Phone 919 286-0529 615 966-0174 514 667-5099 312 226-0217 517 522-4765 Location North Carolina Tennessee Quebec, Canada Illinois Michigan (call before 9 p.m.) The first two labs will not be taking calls in July and August. Call the other three during that time period. Please do not call these numbers unless you need instruc- tions for sampling a crop formation. Much of this effort is volunteered, so collect calls cannot be accepted. General questions about the phenomenon should be directed to North American Circle, P. O. Box 61144, Durham, NC, 27715-1144. A. General Requirements Keep in mind that we are looking for effects which cannot be caused by simple physical trampling. If the soil is muddy, or if the plants look trampled or dirty, don't despair; our tests look beyond those things. Collect even if things look un- promising to the eye. If you suspect the formation to be a hoax, explain why in detail in the notes you submit with the samples. But take the samples anyway, because genuine but trampled or weathered crop circles can look as bad as hoaxes. In addition, we need to compare suspected hoaxes to formations believed genuine. It is always important to collect controls from outside the crop circle as well as samples from inside the crop circle. Controls allow labs to compare conditions inside the forma- tion with \"normal\" conditions outside it. Often, samples lack- ing controls are worthless. Controls should be taken about 100 yards away from the crop circle in any direction, and within the same field. The manner of collection should be uniform. It is also important to include a sketch of the crop circle showing where each sample and control was taken. If you can, include photographs of the general area, though don't hold up the shipment waiting for them to be developed. It is crucial to label each sample accurately — see section D. B. Soil Samples Soil samples will be tested for evidence of unusal radioac- tivity. We believe that newly formed isotopes, if present, would be detectable for only two or three weeks after the circle is formed. (We do not believe they would present a health hazard, since they have been detectable only by highly sensitive equip- ment.) Therefore, it is only worthwhile to take soil samples from fresh crop circles and it is important that those soil samples be rapidly transported to the lab. Consistency in containers is important, so please always use ziploc bags for soil samples. Once the soil is placed in the bag, zip it shut, tape it shut for extra protection, roll it up, and put a rubber band around it. Write up a label and make your notes about the sample at the location while details are fresh in mind. Each sample should consist of about a cupful of soil. The soil sample must be scraped from the very top of the soil, i.e. from the uppermost two or three millimeters. Scrape across the topsoil, not down into it. This is important because the phenomenon probably affects exposed soil more strong- ly than buried soil. A minimum of four samples and four controls (4 in/4 out) should be taken, preferably far apart in different areas of the formation, that is, some in circles, some in rings, some in bars, and so on. If it is possible to take more than 4 in/4 out, by all means do so. Give preference to areas under \"construc- tion lines\" if there are any. (Construction lines are straight lines of plants running underneath the laid crops, often in different directions from the top layer.) Wipe off the scraper between samples, to minimize contamination. IMPORTANT: If you are taking plant samples as well, each soil and plant sample should match. That is, plant sample A should be taken from the same site as soil sample A, and so on. It is vital for correct analysis that there be no confu- sion about which soil and plant samples were taken together as a matching pair. It is critical to get soil samples to the laboratory as quick- ly as possible. If funds permit, mail them by overnight mail. At a minimum, use airmail. Under no conditions should sur- face mail be used because is takes too long to reach the lab. MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 289 May 1992"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"C. Plant Samples There are five American labs prepared to receive plant samples, but since they will be performing different tests, they all require different collection methods. Most samplers will not have the resources to collect samples for all five. Thus the sampler must call one of the telephone numbers above prior to sampling, so that a decision can be made about which lab to collect for and what instructions need to be followed. Here we will give general instructions, which will suffice for many tests. Use these in the absence of specific instructions. Each individual plant sample should consist of a \"bunch\" of seven to ten plants. Plants should be cut off at the soil line, since the roots are not needed. It is important to collect the entire stem and seed head. Only the stems should be mailed immediately. The seed heads should be cut off and stored in open air to dry for two to three weeks. This will prevent mold and fungus from growing in them. (Good, clear, consistent labeling is important to allow stems and seeds to be matched up in the lab.) The stems may be folded up in plastic ziploc bags and then boxed for shipment. (Where folding is unavoidable, do it. But avoid folding at the plant's nodes or \"knuckles.\") Mailing tubes are preferable to ziploc bags and boxing, but one must take extra care that sample bunches do not get mixed up. Again, plants may be folded to fit in the tubes if necessary. Plant samples are not as time-limited as soil samples; therefore, airmail is acceptable. D. Labeling Give as much information as possible. This is not always easy to do under field conditions, but a poorly written label can invalidate the sample. Be as accurate as possible with specific dates and details, but don't be misleadingly accurate. For example, if you know only that a given circle must have been made in the last week of July, don't try to be more precise. Below are two example labels, one for a soil sample, and the other for a soil control: Soil sample 920730, location C, inside formation 3.5 mi. SE of Argonne, Illinois, USA Formed about 3rd wk. July 92. Collected 30 July 92, 2 p.m. Formation: Three single circles Collected by Becky Lewis, (312) 555-5555 Comments: Came from under a construction line; soil seemed harder-packed than at other locations. Soil control 920730, location F, 100m outside formation 3.5 mi. SE of Argonne, Illinois, USA Formed about 3rd wk. July 92. Collected 30 July 92, 2:30 p.m. Formation: Three single circles Collected by Becky Lewis, (312) 555-5555 Comments: Soil sandier here than in crop circle. The sample number (i.e. \"Sample 920730\") is based on the date the formation was made, in yy-mm-dd form. If the date the formation was made is not known, use the date when you took the samples. The real purpose of the sample number is to allow the lab to index the samples without confusion,not to give the actual date of formation. The location letter (\"location C,\" etc.) should be keyed to a sketch of the formation and each letter should mark where each sample was collected. Finally, be sure to tape over the label with clear, water- proof tape. E. Mailing Samples There is generally no difficulty in mailing samples within a country. Mailing samples across national borders is more of a problem, since customs officials can and do confiscate agricultural material. If you mail samples across borders, be sure to ask the lab for its importation permit number. Write this number, and the lab's phone number, on the package. Be sure you include your sketches and notes with the samples, or mail them separately. It is advisable to keep a copy for your own files. F.

Ware Eastern Regional Director The following summarizes some case reports recently received. Unless noted, no sound, vibration or odor was noted. All times are local. • Log #920301E: In February 1990 at 4:00 a.m. a witness reported he and his girlfriend had a CE-3 in East Hampstead, NH; investigator, Charles A. Gallella. Bright reddish light coming through the bedroom back window woke them. The 29-year-old man got up, went to die window, and saw a large circular object about five feet above the ground and 20 feet away. Frightened, he tried to exit the door, but the knob would not budge. He tried the side window, but he could not open it. (The next morning he found the plastic opening handle was broken off.) He hid in the closet, and then his friend said, \"It's no use. They are coming in.\" He came out and found a fat, four-foot-tall, bluish-gray being standing next to his girlfriend. It had a big head with big eyes, a wide nose and a big mouth. He was very frightened, but when it grabbed his hand he felt calm. When it cocked its head and smiled at him, he lost all memory until he awoke in bed the next morning. His friend lost all memory of the incident. He has since had a strange rash several times. Hypnosis is considered. • Log #920303E: On 7 October 1990 at 9:10 p.m., three witnesses, while driving in New Port Richey, FL, saw three red balls of light; investigators, Michael E. Forte and Leonard W. Sturm. They drove another block to home and got their three neighbors out to watch. The lights were at 22 degrees of elevation, moving slowly to the south and were seen for over five minutes. They appeared three times as bright as a star, but did not show up on his 35mm film. One witness has had other UFO sightings and unusual experiences. • Log #920304E: On 2 February 1992 at 7:05 p.m., a retired postman and his wife saw a red-light UFO from their yard in Gulf Breeze, FL; investigator, Joe Barren. He saw talking with his neighbor in the yard when he saw it, motionless and pulsating, in the sky due north of him. This object was reported by at least 11 other people from six different loca- tions: Pier 1, Shoreline Park South, a motorist on Pensacola bridge, another several miles east on Highway 98, and the SW corner of die bridge where the Gulf Breeze Research Team had gathered. Triangulation data indicated it was 3320 feet above Pensacola Bay and less than a mile west of the bridge. It was 9710 feet from the research team on a 322° bearing. The postman's wife thought she saw a \"bulge\" on the top part of the bright red light. Other witnesses got photos and video. • Log #920305E: On 22 August 1988 at 1:00 a.m., a 39-year- old man and his tent mate saw a 30-foot UFO land about 90 feet from them in Athens, Maine; investigator, Diana DeSimone. They were at a trapper's convention, and other campers had apparently gone to sleep when bright lights came through die tent screen. He woke his friend and diey observed die metallic UFO projecting white light for about 45 minutes. They were too afraid to get out of the tent to get a video camera nearby. The UFO emitted a ball of red light that went to the corner of die field, went down, came back under the UFO and \"blinked out.\" A veil of colored circles, like chicken wire, came toward them, and when it entered the tent they both lost all memory until 8:30 that morning when they woke up. Since then, the witness stopped trapping, had a change in religious beliefs, and apparently had an out-of-body ex- perience. Both experienced sleep disturbances, and one got a buzz in his head associated with paralysis, fear, and a black nun-like silhouette. • Log #920306E: On 9 February 1992 about 7:00 p.m., a 40-year-old man reported a white ball of light that once showed a ring of red lights on the bottom; investigators, Bill Goffrier and Joanne Von Voorhis. It was near a hillside in Camden, Maine and viewed from a balcony for 10 minutes before it \"faded\" away. It appeared almost die size of a quarter held at arm's length, and moved up and down and sideways behind the limbs of a nearby tree. The white light had a plasma-like quality. It was estimated to be die size of a house and about 1/4 mile away. The witness had a previous sighting, investigated by Ray Fowler, and has occasionally had UFO dreams that continue to puzzle him. MISSOURI WAVE Night-Lights, Humanoids & Mutilations Investigated by Duane & Susan Bedell, John Carpenter, Lisa Dusenberry, Dennis Mount, Jeanne Robinson, Vince Serencko, Tom Strand and Carla Vincel T he Northview, MO sighting \"wave\" came to the atten- tion of investigators by two sources. The first source informed Duane and Susan Bedell of the sightings by North- view area residents. Residents were becoming concerned about the regularity of the sightings and the traffic congestion engendered by observers at the 144/Northview exit. The sec- ond source informed investigators at the monthly MUFON public information meeting held in Springfield, MO. The source, a resident of the Northview area, told investigators MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 289 May 1992"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"that the \"light(s) in the sky\" appeared regularly between 9:20 p.m. and 9:40 p.m. and could be observed almost any clear night. Another area resident present at the meeting confirmed the information. The regularity of the sightings concerned State Section Directors Duane Bedell and Tom Strand. The 144/Northview exit, and area in general, is directly in the flight path of air- craft traversing between Springfield and St. Louis, MO. Fur- ther, aircraft also approach Springfield along the opposite heading. Witnesses were reporting the sightings as light(s) in the western sky suddenly appearing, as though a light switch was turned on, motionless, and either disappearing below the horizon or disappearing as though a light switch was turned off. However, other reports of sightings of a much different nature, including close observations of craft, convinced Bedell and Strand that a full investigation was necessary and pru- dent. Accordingly, plans were made to observe and photograph the light(s) and, if possible, to triangulate sightings from selected observation points. Observations The first \"expedition\" was organized for Saturday, February 1, 1992. Investigators set up cameras along the outer road at the Northview exit and began the vigil. At 9:41 p.m., the ob- ject suddenly appeared in the west about 20 degrees above the horizon. The object was amber in color and appeared to move laterally slowly, occasionally moving behind a tree line on a hill just to the west of observers. The light was observed for approximately seven minutes before disappearing below the horizon. Investigators moved to the west approximately two miles but were unable to relocate the light. All in- vestigators were able to get at least 4 to 5 time-exposure photos before the object disappeared. The photos revealed only a light source above the horizon. Additionally, at the time of the object's appearance, Tom Strand, who was monitoring Springfield Regional Airport communications, heard a plane being cleared to land on approximately the object's observed bearing. However, later triangulation from points marked dur- ing the sighting indicated that the object was approximately only one-quarter mile away from the observation points, which placed it over a small field surrounded by trees — a field wherein an unusual experience was reported later 1 . The triangulation distance was puzzling; the object had looked much further away. S ubsequent expeditions were coordinated between widely separated observation points with investigators remaining in contact via walkie-talkies and CB radios. Individual in- vestigators also made other trips to Northview. The investiga- tion soon became more complicated; the media had picked up the story and the area became a mecca for the sincere, the ambivalent, and the beer-drinking, cheap-thrill seeker. The atmosphere became circus-like and unlikely to produce results; chasing lights in the sky was never going to be con- clusive. Fortunately, the investigation was able to move into more productive avenues opened by the Northview investiga- tion. Bedell and Strand concluded that the investigation would yield better results if it were concentrated in the new areas; they also concluded that the probability of most sightings being conventional aircraft was very high, particularly after spend- ing several nights watching lights similar to the alleged UFOs turn out to be such conventional aircraft. Craft Sightings Three craft sightings have been reported since February 1, 1992; one in Webster county near Marshfield, and two in Greene county. One of the Greene county sightings took place near the east Springfield city limits and the second occurred near Willard, MO, a few miles north of Springfield Regional Airport. The craft were all of different'configurations and one potential abduction scenario is suspected. Separate reports of these cases will be filed. Cattle Mutilations Nine cattle mutilations have also been reported in Webster county. Six of the mutilations have been confirmed and three have been investigated by Duane Bedell, Susan Bedell and Tom Strand. Tissue and fluid samples were obtained and for- warded to Dr. John Altshuler for analysis. The animals are believed to have been killed on February 3, 1992. All three of the investigated mutilations occurred in areas reporting strange lights in or near the fields containing the animals. Summaries of these investigations are included with this summary. Humanoid Reports Two reports of humanoid creatures were also made in con- nection with the Northview sightings. One sighting occur- red near Northview 20 years ago and one ocurred near the field and pond mentioned in footnote one 10 years ago. Both described small, silver suited \"children\" that did not look like children. Conclusions A great deal of activity has been reported and is continu- ing to be investigated as thoroughly as possible. It seems ap- parent that something significant is occurring, and has been 1 Two teenage boys were in the field February 9, 1992 with the intent of observing \"the light.\" At approximately, 10:00 p.m. they were near a small pond in the field that was suddenly illuminated by an amber light coming from beyond the tree line on the east side of the field. The light illuminated the entire pond, which is approximately 30 feet in diameter, for an estimated two seconds before abruptly ceasing. The boys saw no potential source nor heard any sound with the light. The tree line at the eastern edge of the field marks the edge of the hilltop field; beyond the tree line to the east is a steep drop and a flat wooded valley.

MUTILATION SUMMARIES By MUFON Field Investigators Duane Bedell, Susan Bedell and Tom Strand Charles Cologna Ranch, Northview, MO — A dead and mutilated cow was discovered 4 February 1992 by owner Charles Cologna and Andrew Cologna in a pasture approx- imately one quarter mile from Charles Cologna's home. The Colognas had observed the cow the day before in the same location but at the time believed it to merely be asleep. Upon investigation they discovered that two of the teats were removed from the udder, the left jaw was stripped to the bone and clean, an eight-inch strip of hide had been removed under the chin, the left ear completely removed and the right ear removed down to a metal marking tag, the rectum cored out, and the tongue cut out, with the inside of the mouth appear- ing to have been burned black. There was nothing to indicate that a struggle had been involved in the animal's death. An autopsy was performed by Dr. Scott Espey, DVM, who, in addition to the wounds and conditions noted above, found that the animal's spinal cord had been pulled approximately one foot up into the neck and skull, apparently with the vertebrae left intact and unaffected by the cord position. Dr. Espey is reported to have remarked, \"This is the spookiest thing I've ever seen.\" The cow also was in the first trimester of pregnancy. The animal also appeared to have the left foreleg pulled from the shoulder socket and broken back under. Tissue samples were taken from the left ear (small sam- ple), the right ear (including metal tag), and from the jaw/throat area. The left ear was also tagged with a plastic tag that could only be removed intact by cutting the ear. The tag was recovered and is included in the samples. Ragsdale Ranch, Marshfield, MO — Two animals were discovered dead on 5 February 1992 by owner Philip Ragsdale. One animal had apparently died instantly without struggle and had two patches of hide removed from the underbelly. The animal was found at the edge of a wooded area border- ing the pasture with its head to the east. The other animal had struggled dramatically, apparently crawling or dragging itself on its belly for approximately 50 to 75 feet before dying. The path of the animal was over rocks, stumps and other obstacles common to a semi-wooded pasture area. The animal was not mutilated and was found facing downhill, leaning against a tree with its head to the east. Autopsies were performed on both animals by Dr. Max Hartman, DVM, of Marshfield, MO. The autopsies did not discern any apparent cause of death or wounds other than the strips of missing hide. Both animals were pregnant (in the last trimester) and the fetuses were removed during the autopsies. The fetuses, both male, did not exhibit any unusual features and were intact. During the course of the autopsy, Dr. Hartman remarked that the wounds from which the hide was removed had been made with surgical precision, going through only to the thickness of the hide and not beyond into the flesh. The edges of the wounds were discolored and smooth, reportedly with a somewhat rubbery consistency. The fore wound was oval-shaped, approximately 1 and 1/2 inches wide by 4 inches long. The aft wound was triangular in shape and measured 8 inches at the widest point. Bodily fluids were intact in both animals, and blood was not found in the area or in the wounds. The animal which had struggled had a small amount of blood coming from its nostrils. A sample of fluid from the mutilated animal's eye was taken by Dr. Hartman and is included with this report, as is a tissue sample from the oval-shaped wound. Both carcasses exhibited a lack of predatory activity, and were not as decomposed as one might expect after three weeks of relatively warm weather (well above freezing); a very minor smell of decay was pre- sent at the mutilated animal, and a somewhat stronger smell was present at the other. Neither had the degree of smell or decay expected with disemboweled animals three weeks after death.  ' OTHERS' WORDS, Continued One of the John Keel's most popular books, THE MOTHMAN PROPHECIES, has been reprinted in a beautiful softcover edition with cover art by fantasy artist Frank Frazetta. While I might quarrel with the publisher's statement that \"every single word\" of the book is true, PROPHECIES does make for very interesting reading, presenting the inside story of events along the Ohio-West Virginia border in the late 1960s. This 275-page edition is priced at $16.95 (plus $1.50 for ship- ping and handling) and may be ordered from IllumiNet Press, P.O. Box 746, Avondale Estates, GA, 30002. IllumiNet will also be publishing the first English translation of Spanish researcher Salvador Freixedo's VISIONARIES, MYSTICS AND CONTACTEES. Barring any delays, this should be ready by the time you read this column and will be priced at $12.95 (plus the same shipping and handling charge). Recent hardcover releases include two books by Jacques Vallee, REVELATIONS and UFO CHRONICLES OF THE SOVIET UNION (both from Ballantine), Dr. David Jacobs' SECRET LIFE (Simon & Schuster), Jerome Clark's Volume 2 of his UFO Encyclopedia project, THE EMERGENCE OF A PHENOMENON (Omnigraphics) and Mark Carlotto's THE MARTIAN ENIGMAS (North Atlantic Books). Other forthcoming books from North Atlantic Books include a re- vised edition of Richard Hoagland's THE MONUMENTS OF MARS (April) and yet another Vallee book, FORBID- DEN SCIENCE. The latter title is Vallee's personal journal for the years 1957-1969.

If you've forgotten just how strange (and long) a trip ufology has been, this encyclopedic survey will remind you right from the open- ing entry (Adamski, George) to the closing one (Williamson, George Hunt, aka Michael d'Obrenovic). And, in fact, these are almost two of the more normal characters in a cast of hundreds that make up the often strange menagerie of modern ufology. Not that Clark doesn't give considerable coverage to UFO \"straight\" types like Capt. Edward Rup- pelt (former head of Project Blue Book and the author of The Report of Unidentified Flying Objects, one of the field's few legitimate classics), the Lorenzens (Jim and Coral, founders of APRO), Maj. Donald Keyhoe (of NICAP), Isabel Davis and others; it's just that they have a hard time competing with the colorful likes of the Howard Mengers, Ray Palmers, Richard Shavers, Otis T. Carrs, George Van Tassels and Gray Barkers of ufology. Like it or not, contemporary ufologists are stuck with a past that includes more than its fair share of crackpots, semi- charlatans (did I mention Carlos Allende?) and, on occasion apparently, outright criminals. But don't get the impression that Emergence is little more than a glorified biographical Who's-Who of ufology, past and present; this is a monumental work of sustained dedication that should be as wel- comed by the historical scholar and the student of both science and human nature, as by the average ufologist curious about his or her roots and the phenomenon itself. The only drawback is that the average ufologist may not be able to afford the $85 cover price. There are 113 individual listings here, all but two authored by Clark himself, a former editor of Fate Magazine, now vice-president of the J. Allen Hynek Center for UFO Studies, and current editor of that organization's International UFO Reporter. Thomas E. Bullard, Ph. D., contributes a lengthy essay on pre-1800 aerial anomalies, and Bill Chalker covers UFOs in both Australia and New Zealand. There are nearly 300,000 words in its 433 pages, including a cross-referenced index and scattered art and photographs. For a work of this kind, Emergence is eminently readable, a tribute to Clark's straight-ahead no-nonsense style, and, I must admit, to the subject matter itself, which is almost endlessly fascinating. Aside from the personality, publication and organization entries, readers are treated to a smorgasbord of events and specific cases that have shaped this nearly unmanageable field, from the ghost rockets of 1946, the Maury Island Hoax, the Flatwoods Monster of West Virginia, the Mantel! Incident, the Villas-Boas CE3 case, the Lakenheath-Bentwaters Radar/Visual sighting, the CIA-sponsored Robertson Panel, Green Fireballs, the Gorman encounter, the Kelly-Hopkinsville CE3, Hollow Earth theories, the Levelland sightings and many, many more. I envy anyone just coming across much of this material for the first time.

In the main, Clark marshalls this mountain of material as objectively as any academic historian. In at least two instances where he could have given way to paranoid suspicions or bruitings (namely, the infamous second edition of Ruppelt's Report, and in the demise of NICAP), Clark simply lets the available known facts speak for themselves. His treatment of the many personalities and organiza- tions appears equally even-handed, although I'm sure some readers are bound to complain that their particular shibboleths or sacred cows have been stepped on or mistreated. From here it appears that Clark has managed to pull off the almost monumen- tally impossible: as a dedicated insider, he has managed to put together a volume of UFO history that reads as if it had been written by an impartial outsider. One may not always agree with all the opi- nions Clark expresses in his voluminous writings, but one has to appreciate the achievement that is Emergence and stand in awe of the sheer amount of work that has gone into it. It's daunting enough just to read, without even thinking about what must have gone into the writing. As a reviewer, in fact, I'm suitably daunted.

It stopped almost directly overhead and the group of men watched it perform wild gyrations for several minutes. They said the object, after having approached in a straight line, began to move erratically in wide circles. All this time it reflected light, like metal, but intermittently, as though the angle of reflection might be changing from time to time. The men estimated its height at 1000 feet. For nearly 20 minutes they watched it climb, dive, reverse its flight course, and final- ly move off into the wind in a westerly direction. At no time did anyone hear any noise. The witnesses were interviewed by representatives of the 15th Air Force headquarters who identified the objects as possibly birds. (Report on the UFO Wave of 1947, by Ted Bloecher) • In the last week of May, Dr. Golden R. Battey, a physi- cian in Augusta, Georgia, was fishing ten miles off St. Helena Sound, near Beaufort, South Carolina. About 11:00 a.m. he noticed a formation of four disc-like objects flying overhead in a southeasterly direction at a terrific rate of speed. The discs appeared to be spinning on their axes and were at an estimated altitude of about 20,000 feet. They were silvery and appeared highly polished. No sound was heard as they flew overhead. On their undersides, Dr. Battey noticed a circular rim, or projection, about one-quarter of the way in from the edge. The objects sped out of view in less than 20 seconds. (The Report on the UFO Wave of 1947) • About the middle of the month, Byron Savage, a businessman and private pilot, spotted a strange object over Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. He described the object as be- ing a shiny, silvery color, and very large. It was perfectly round and flat and made no noise. (Report on the UFO Wave of 1947) May 1952 • Two Brazilian reporters, Ed Keffel and Joac Martins, had been sent by their editor to a place called Ilha dos Amores (Isle of the Lovers), in the district of Barra de Tijuca, Brazil, on work in connection with their magazine. On the seventh, Keffel had his camera loaded and ready to start work. The time was nearing 4 p.m. when Martins drew his attention to what he thought to be a strange-looking air- craft coming in from the sea. At first they thought it to be a head-on view of a distant airplane, but were puzzled because the thing was traveling sideways and at considerable speed. After a few seconds Keffel started to take photographs and by now both men had realized that the object was in fact a circular disc moving soundlessly without a sign of vapor trail. They observed that the disc was blue-grey in color. It was not glowing, but metallic in appearance. After completing a semicircle over the Tijuca woods, it ceased its rush and started to slip in \"pendulum fashion,\" losing height just like a falling leaf from a tree. It then accelerated at a terrific rate and disappeared the way it had come, out to sea. Keffel was able to take five pictures in all. Later these were shown to Sir Miles Thomas, chairman of BOAC, who commented: \"I think it is the wheel-cover of the DC-3 or DC-4.\" But a com- parison of the Brazilian pictures with DC-4 wheels revealed no such similarity. The reporters were certain the object was large, \"twice the size of an airplane.\" (The Express, San An- tonio, TX 8/15/55) • About 1 a.m. on the eighth, a Pan American Airlines DC-4 was flying south toward Puerto Rico, about 600 miles off Jacksonville, Florida. They had just been advised by radio that there were no other airplanes in the area when the co- pilot noticed a light up ahead which looked like a tail-light of another aircraft. The co-pilot reached over and slapped the pilot on the shoulder and pointed. Just at that instant the light began to get bigger and bigger until it was ten times the size of a landing light of an airplane. It continued to close in and with a flash it streaked by the DC-4's left wing. Before the crew could react and say anything, two more smaller balls of fire flashed by. Both pilots later said that they sat in their seats for several seconds with sweat trickling down their backs. After being interviewed by an Air Force officer, the two pilots concluded that, \"We always thought these people who reported flying saucers were crazy, but now we don't know.\" (The Report On Unidentified Flying Objects by Edward Ruppelt) May 1957 • On the fourth, radio commentator Henry J. Taylor, President Eisenhower's nominee for ambassador to Switzerland, said that about 10 percent of UFO reports are \"very disturbing\" and must be taken seriously. Taylor was questioned earlier at a closed-door hearing by members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee who later approved his nomination by voice vote without a record ballot. His testimony was also made public on the fourth. In response to questions about his oft-expressed belief in UFOs, Taylor said: \"Nine out often cases are either ridiculous or publici- ty seekers, or misconceptions, optical illusions and a hun- dred different reasons, but there is a tenth one that is very disturbing.\" He said this tenth case has to be taken seriously because it \"has been seen by too many sober-minded peo- ple, with photographic and other evidence.\" In his discussion of UFOs, Taylor told the Senators that: \"I haven't the faintest idea what is happening. I just don't know, and I don't know anybody else who knows.\" But, he added, \"It is very difficult to deny that something is happening around us that we just don't quite understand ... I just don't think that we know all the secrets of the universe yet.\" (S.P.A.C.E.

Campeadore said he heard a strange, loud hum- ming sound and at first thought it was a truck trying to pass so he moved over, but he could not see any lights in his rear view mirror. He then stopped the car and jumped out. The UFO, which he estimated to be 40-50 feet in diameter was hovering over his head at an altitude of 25-35 feet. Campeadore, thoroughly frightened, reached into his car, got his .25 caliber pistol, injected a clip of ammunition and began firing. He said he heard the bullets hit and ricochet as if they had struck metal. At this point the object accelerated and left at high speed. (The A.P.R.O. Bulletin, May-June 1967) May 1972 • Four youngsters, residents of Canterbury, New Hampshire, were sleeping out beside a barn on the edge of a large open field on the 13th. Their father had checked on the boys around 9:30 p.m., found them to be safe, and left. About 10 minutes later one of the boys, who was observing stars, suddenly shouted to his companions that one of the stars appeared to be on fire and heading toward them. The other boys looked up and saw a very bright light source descending slowly toward the field. Concurrently they began hearing a sound apparently coming from the object. They jumped out of their sleeping bags and ran to the edge of the' field to get a better view of what they thought was a helicopter coming down. One of the youngsters used his flashlight and aimed it at the approaching object. Then, according to the youngsters, the UFO did something very strange: it suddenly and yet very smoothly, like a fall- ing, floating balloon, descended in a sideways, zig-zag, man- ner. The boys, asked individually to describe the object they had reported, said it looked like an octahedron-shaped craft that appeared to be tilted at a 45-degree angle as it moved across the open field. It had four pipe-like legs with round pads affixed to the end of each leg. A bright white light on its forward moving side seemed to turn on them, and, accord- ing to the witnesses, lit up the chicken coop and the sur- rounding area. A fiery 10-foot-long exhaust appeared beneath the object which seemed to switch from one color to another. The witnesses also observed a number of bright, silver, in- verted U-shaped cable-like things sticking into the top of the object. As the object passed directly over them the boys estimated the altitude at about 150 feet, and the size of the UFO to be between one and two car-lengths in both height and width. (UFO Investigator, July 1972) May 1977 • Two astronomers considering the possible pay- off of radio searches for life elsewhere say it appears most likely our galaxy either is essentially empty of other civiliza- tions o'r is extensively colonized. Drs. Thomas Kuiper and Mark Morris of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory and the Califor- nia Institute of Technology, said in the May 6th issue of the journal Science, that if the galaxy has been colonized there are some interesting implications: That a galactic communi- ty would exist in which civilizations communicate with each other and that Earth is within the sphere of influence of one or more extraterrestrial civilizations; that our solar system would probably have been visited; and that an advanced civilization probably would have representatives somewhere in the solar neighborhood, and may already have sent an un- manned probe into the solar system to contact us when we reach some developmental threshold. (The Telegraph, Nashua, NH 5/11/77; Science magazine, 5/6/77) • An awesome triangular-shaped UFO, big as a football field and lighted like a flying Christmas tree, was observed soar- ing over Memphis, Tennessee by five police officers, all members of that city's SWAT team. The officers watched the gigantic metallic craft for up to three minutes before it blazed across the clear night sky at astounding speed and disappeared. \"It was approximately as long as a football field and 50 to 75 yards wide,\" Patrolman Troy L. Todd said. \"I believe what I saw was some aircraft not of this world.\" Todd first spotted the eerie UFO about 3:30 a.m. on the 17th, hovering over some high-tension wires. Moments later he and his partner, Patrolman Jerry W. Jeter, observed it hovering 500 feet above a golf course. They got out of their van and watched it for two or three minutes. \"It was a triangular-shaped object with white, red and green lights, and awhile glow around the silhouette itself,\" Todd said. \"We were not directly under it, but at a slight angle, about two blocks away, and we could see the whole belly of the craft,\" Jeter said. \"Two red lights came on at the rear and it just shot out of sight.\" Todd said the huge craft made no noise as it zipped across the sky and vanished over the horizon. Three other members of the SWAT team, Patrolman Michael L. Davidson, John R. Birdsong, and Forrest E. Bartlett, had seen the same craft four and a half hours earlier, while they were in a police substation parking lot.

The girls said they were playing in the wooded area when they heard a strange humming sound. They investigated and saw a long cylindrical object, about 30 feet in length, with a dome on top and with a red rotating band around it. Standing beside the object was what appeared to be a man dressed all in silver. The girls ran off, and when they turned around they saw the object taking off in jerky movements before streaking skywards at a tremendous speed.

Thirty seconds later, said the three boys, they had watched in amazement as a bluish-green conical-shaped object rose rapidly from a tall gum tree in a group of trees 20 meters to their right. Alex Medaras, 14, said the object had made a noise similar to the muffled sound of a jet taking off. \"It was a low-pitched vroom sort of noise,\" Alex said. The object, which ascended from the trees, had sped off in a different direction from the original beam of light, which came from overhead. The beam, about three meters in diameter, had surrounded three bicycles the boys had put down in the clearing while they had lain on the grass about 10 meters away. \"The bikes gave off a metallic glow while the beam was on them,\" Alex said. Clark said he had raced forward when the beam had first appeared, thinking he could put his hand through it. Seconds later he found himself lying on the ground.

Tilly Believe it or not, there are still lots of people out there who don't know about MUFON, let alone have facts about UFOs and abductions. As Director of Public Education I would like to initiate two projects to assist us in an out-reach program to help inform the public. First, don't forget National UFO Information Week is August 9-15, 1992! Hopefully everyone is aware that MUFON has an annual National UFO Information Week. For eight years members have been encouraged to engage in a number of activities during this specially designated week to help develop a well-informed understanding in the general popula- tion about this phenomenon. This program was initiated in 1984 by Marge Christensen. Many state groups, as well as many individuals, have pro- moted National UFO Information Weeks in the past. It is time to put the best of those ideas together. Therefore I am en- couraging all State and Provincial Directors and anyone else with a good idea to send them to us. Then we will put together the best suggestions and make them available for anyone who is interested. This will be especially helpful for states just starting to become active, or for anyone looking for some new approaches to informing the public. UFO Courses/Classes In recent years several MUFON members have taught classes about UFOS. We know that John Salter conducts such a course at the University of North Dakota. I have held classes in community education programs. Others may have taught in high school, gifted elementary classes, or other special programs. This, then, is a plea for all instructors no matter at what level to share a course outline or syllabus (and any other helpful information) with us. We would like to put them together in some format for other members to use in their states or local areas. This is an excellent method of helping to educate the people on this subject and there is always a lot of interest, too. All information for either National UFO Information Week or on education courses should be sent to Virginia M. Tilly, 73 Borman, Flushing, MI 48433. ABDUCTEE PERSONALITY ASSESSMENT Personality assessment researcher and writer, Anne Car- doza, M.A. (author of 33 books) is giving the Form J Myers- Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) to all survivors of UFO ab- ductions who wish to take this test for a research project to determine whether there is any correlation between Jungian / Myers Briggs Personality Type and the fact that the person complains of bodily abduction and tampering by UFO aliens. If you're a psychologist, hypnotherapist, or counselor who is treating patients for prior or continuing abuse and post traumatic stress syndrome after complaining of contacts or abductions by UFO aliens or similar extraterrestrial entities not related to any religious experience, please give your clients the Form J TDI / EAR MBTI and send the scored answer sheet to Anne Cardoza, keeping a photocopy for your client. Or Anne Cardoza will administer the Form J MBTI to anyone from the general public who complains of being con- tinuously abducted by UFO aliens. The test is scored by Con- sulting Psychologists Press Scoring Service in Palo Alto and returned to Anne Cardoza, who will return a photocopy of the scored MBTI to the client or therapist. The original scored MBTI will be turned over to the research division of the Center for Applications of Psychological Type in Gainesville, Florida when 75 to 100 scored Form J MBTIs (TM) are collected. To take the Form J, 290-question MBTI, send $10 (to pay for the purchase of the type indicator from CPP and postage, handling and research by Anne Cardoza) and a 10\" x 13\" large Manila self-addressed, stamped (with two 29-cent stamps) envelope to: Anne Cardoza, M.A., Personality Assessment Communication, P.O.

Webb June 1992 • Bright Planets (Evening Sky): Jupiter (magnitude -1.9), in Leo, is well up in the SW at dusk. Saturn (0.5), in Capricornus, rises in the E about 11:30 PM in mid-Ju;ie. • Bright Planets (Morning Sky): Mars (0.9), moving from Pisces into Aries during the month, rises about 2:30 in midmonth and lies low above the E horizon at dawn. Jupiter sets in the W about 12:30 in mid-June, before mid- night by month's end. Saturn proceeds westward in the southern sky, arriving at a point low in the S at dawn. • Partial Lunar Eclipse: On the night of June 14-15, weather permitting, observers throughout North America (except Alaska) will see most of a 69% partial eclipse of the Moon. (The eastern half of the U.S. can view the entire event, while in the North- west the Moon rises just after the dark umbral phase of the eclipse has begun.) At 11:27 PM (EDT) the northern edge of the full moon enters the Earth's central shadow (um- bra). A maximum of 69% of the Moon's diameter is hid- den at 12:57 AM. Umbral eclipse ends at 2:27. • Moon Phases: First quarter — June 7 Full moon — June 15 Last quarter — June 23 New Moon — June 30 • The Stars: After the long evening twilight ends, the stellar trio that forms the Summer Triangle advances up the eastern sky. Each star making up that geometrical figure resides in its own constellation — Vega in Lyra the Harp, Deneb in Cygnus the Swan, and Altair in Aquila the Eagle. This spring a star flared up 8° N of Deneb, the first naked- eye nova since 1975. Unlike a supernova explosion, a nova is believed to occur when one star in a two-member system draws off hydrogen gas from its neighbor, ultimately resulting in an explosion in the attracting starts outer at- mosphere. Nova Cygni 1992 is not far from the site of the much brighter 1975 nova. The spring groups — Leo the Lion (accompanied by Jupiter), Bootes the Herdsman, and Virgo the Maiden — have slid past the meridian into the west. The Big Dipper begins its downward swing in the NW. Be aware of an IFO culprit, the bright star Capella, which skirts the northern horizon at this time of the year. MESSAGE, Continued current MUFON I.D. card is entitled to one vote. The award plaque and monetary prize will be presented on July 12, 1992, at the MUFON 1992 International UFO Symposium in Albuquerque, New Mexico, or mailed to the awardee if he/she is not present to accept in person. Entity Bust The cover photo on the October 1990 issue number 270 of the MUFON UFO Journal featured a plaster of paris com- posite bust of an entity frequently reported by witnesses. This photo has been reproduced in UFO publications in numerous foreign countries. Due to the popularity of this 8'/2 inch high white bust with prominent black eyes, the artist, Robert A. Taylor, is making them available commercially. For details, please send a self-addressed stamp envelope (U.S.A.) to Taylor Studio, P.O. Box 9761, Fort Wayne, IN 46899. THE UFO PRESS, Continued not quite so daunted as not to quibble. Unlike its predeccesor, UFOs in the 1980s, Emergence does have illustrations throughout, but they are rarely of such a quality as to make art directors sit up and take notice. And rare as statistical analyses in this field might be, Emergence would also benefit from the inclusion of what reliable charts and graphics (if any) are available. The type and layout are certainly legible, and the acid-free paper insures that the book will be around longer than most people who read it. A t any rate, these quibbles rarely detract from what is almost certain to become a classic in the field, both as history and reference source. Anyone else out there con- templating a competing UFO encyclopedia is best advised to fold up shop and save their time and money. Clark may not have been \"firstest\" (two other single-volume en- cyclopedias by Story and Sachs, both long out of print, have been produced over the years), but he has certainly arrived on a now unlevel playing field with the \"mostest.\" Moreover, a third volume is in the works, also from Omnigraphics. There is at least some speculation that all three volumes of the UFO Encyclopedia will eventually be collected into a single paperback volume (presumbly about the size of the Manhattan telephone directory). But if I were you I'd bite the bullet and buy now, even if you have to take on a second job to be able to afford it. Very highly recommended.

Tilly, Director of Public Education, has an- nouced that MUFON's annual UFO Information Week is scheduled for August 9 through 16, 1992. In order to secure space at shopping malls, libraries, and public facilities, we have found that it is essential to make arrangements and reser- vations now. Shopping malls, in particular, normally need six months advance notice to plan their advertising and sales promotions. Computerization of UFO File Dan Wright has advised that he has entered 132 UFO cases into the database as of April 9, 1992, that were evaluated as complete for 1990 from the Form 2's submitted with the reports. Short UFO case summaries for publication in the Journal have been received from only one Regional Direc- tor. Another Director submitted a summary report, which had to be returned for revisions to comply with the format in- stituted by Dan Wright and followed by Donald M. Ware. MUFON's Special States In the U.S. Senate every state is representated by two senators regardless of that state's population; conversely, in the House of Representatives each state is represented pro- portionately to its population. Each of our states has a State Director, however if each had an Assistant State Director, as recommended, this would be comparable to the U.S. Senate. One of MUFON's major objectives is to have a State Sec- tion Director assigned to every county in each state. Even if the number of members in each state was a proportionate ratio to the population this would leave wide open spaces in geographically large states such as Alaska, Montana, Utah and Wyoming. Obviously, UFO sightings do occur in these states, but it would be difficult for the witnesses to locate an investigator in such sparsely populated areas. What can be done to eliminate this handicap? It offers an exceptional challenge to the State Director and his/her team to not only locate competent State Section directors, but to recruit new field investigators. Without a doubt, the states having a relatively small square mile area, such as Rhode Island, Vermont, Puerto Rico and Maine, have an advantage in communications, advertising and training of new in- vestigators. This month we are emphasizing the special states that need attention, starting with the states having the smallest number of members. They are North Dakota 5, Alaska 6, Wyoming 6, Vermont 7, Puerto Rico 8, Montana 10, West Virginia 11, Idaho 11, Rhode Island 11, Utah 11, Maine 12 and South Dakota 13. Davina M. Ryszka, State Director for South Dakota, is a fine example of what can be done to revitalize her in- vestigative team in the past year. They have also been involved in crop circles and animal mutilation cases. State Directors that need help in building up their team should not hesitate to contact their Regional Director or MUFON headquarters in Seguin for assistance. Your MUFON Field Investigator's Manual has some ideas and procedures that are helpful. Good luck and best wishes. MUFON Annual UFO Award The following candidates have been nominated by members of the MUFON Board of Directors to be awarded a plaque honoring the person deemed most instrumental in advancing the science of Ufology.
