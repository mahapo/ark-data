As suggested, we have retained the acronym \"MUFON\" and the organizational concept \"UFO Network.\" The work MUTUAL best des- cribes MUFON ! s dedication to sharing UFO information and research data. Webster's New Collegiate Dictionary defines \"Mutual\" as: \"1, Entertained, proffered, or exerted by each with respect to the other of two, or each of the others of a group: reciprocally given and re- ceived.\" Roget's New Pocket Thesaurus sheds further light on similar words describing \"mutual\" as \"shsred, collective joint (co-operstion); reciprocal, give-and-take, correlative (exchange); dependent, inter- dependent (relationship).\" MUFON ! s international expansion i'urther necessitated a more appropriate name. It is a pleasure to announce thet Henry H. McKay, 40 Beacham Cres- cent, Agincourt, Ontario, Canada, has accepted the position of Provin- cial Director for Ontario.

Reported by Walter H. Andrus. UFO Seen At Hannibal, Mo. Transcript From KHMO Radio Station, June 29, 1973 News Broadcast: Some members of the Hannibal police department, those who were on duty at about 3:20 this morning, have become believers in UFOs. Sightings were reported not only over Hannibal early this morning, but also over St. Louis end southeast Missouri. Hannibal police described the object as larger than an airplane with two bright white beacons on opposite sides and also bearing red and blue lights. Observers said there was no sound as it passed over Hannibal* Police saw the object moving west-northwest at about 3:20 a.m. and observed it for 2 to 3 minutes. They contacted Monroe City police, who also saw the object, and said it appeared to be over Shelbina. Then Monroe City police reported the object had changed direction and was heading northeast, shortly after which Hannibal police-saw the object again, heading toward Quincy, 111., but turning due east. The second observation lasted for 5 minutes or more. It was said to have appeared the same both times and was visible as far as the horizon. In an article in the \"Herald-Whig,\" Quincy, out of Hannibal, Police Detective Kenneth Caldwell said he observed a large-slow moving object with a line of lights on it and a blue light £t the end. Although he couldn't make out the shape of the object in the dark, he said it appeared to be above the clouds and larger than an aircraft. The sighting is being investigated by Joe Brill and Barry Dimmitt. UFQ Sighted in Israel Tel Aviv.—Scientists are unable to explain an unidentified flying object claimed to have been seen in the skies over -Lsrael. J-t was de- scribed as \"glowing like a bright star\" and was said to have moved in a circular directio'n with four or five small shining sattelities at its sides. It wss observed at about 3 p.m. and was visible for only a few seconds. A spokesman at the Mitzpe Ramon observatory in the Negev said the object definitely wts not tne orbiting SKYLAB launched from Cape Kennedy.

Nicholl, of Kansas City, who, with Ted Phillips, of Sedalia, Mo., was co-chairman. Both are to be complimented for the arrangements made for publicity with all the news media and for the smoothly running program which ran from one presentation to the next without a flaw. The Regency ballroom at the Plaza Inn provided comfortable seating for the hundreds in attendance, and many also attended the dinner in the Regency Room East that evening. Space was also provided for var- ious exhibits and UFO literature, with a great deal of interest shown in all. Sales of the book \"MUFON Symposium 1973\" passed all optimistic expectations as did the number of subscriptions to SKYLOOK received. The program, as given in earlier issues of SKYLOOK, proceeded as scheduled, with an attentive audience for each speaker. Walter H. /.ndrus, Director of MUFON, addressed the conference briefly; and the lectures made by John F. Schuessler, Ted Phillips, Adrian Vance, Stanton T. Friedman and Dr. J. Allen Hynek were so ably presented and enthusias- tically received that MUFON now asks, \"What are we going to do next year to top this one?\" The 90-minute UFO documentary film shown was equally well received, and the question and answer session with a panel made of symposium speakers indicated the great interest in the UFO phenomenon as the questions ran over the scheduled time period and finally had to be closed because of the lateness of the hour. .Press coverage was good, with the Kansas City \"Times\" and \"Star\" devoting considersble space in favorable comment and being quoted in Associated Press releases over the United States. Advance publicity was wide spread and MUFON is gr£teful to the co-chairmen and all others, both in and out of the organization, who helped advertise tnis annual event which grows in importance each year, we do not overlook some of the UFO publications which also cooperated in informing their readers of the symposium and sent rep- resentatives to attend and report the proceedings. Your SKYLOOK editor adds a personal word of appreciation to fro- setta Holmes, who was in charge of tne SKYLOOK table, and assistants Carol Armstrong and Lucius Farish. MUFON, which has long outgrown its \"Midwest\" identification, will be known in the future as the Mutual UFO Network—keeping the initials MUFON and recognizing the \"mutual\" spirit of fine cooperation at the same time it covers our expanding global spread. While it may be some time before all refer to us by our new name, our members know that whetter it is \"Midwest\" or \"Mutual\", we are the same in our interests and goals and the letters MUFON covers it all. In closing, we are very pleased to report that Walt Andrus will continue to serve as Director of MUFON. we have the bestl Because we came out early last month, we could not include this report in the July issue.

The story was released through the Herald Africa News Service. Joe Brill, of our staff end International Coordinator for MUFON, wrote to the pilot, Captain Gilberto N. da Costa, and obtained this report from him in a personal letterof May 20th. We quote: \"I have been with Beta Airlines since 1943 and have accomplished a total of 21,000 hours of flying experience accident free. I took my initial jet training at western Airlines in Los Angeles in 1971. \"On the 3th of January, this year, due to technical orders our flight was delayedfrom Nampula to Lourenco Marques with a stop at Beira. The aircraft, a Boeing 737, was registered CR-BAC with Beta. Besides myself, the crew consisted of First Officer Nasi Pereira, Second Officer Teixeira and four hostesses. \"We were airborne from Beira at 02:45 a.m. and had reached an alti- tude of 26,000 feet on a heading of 211 degrees magnetic. About twenty minutes out of Beira, I noticed a light source at more or less ground level, flashing strongly green, red and white. I called by First Officer T s and my Second Officer's attention to this light. It was something I had never seen before on my hundreds of previous flights. \"Suddenly, the light gained altitude, increased its speed, flashing continuously towards our aircraft. Astonished by its speed and its brightness, I reported the sighting to the Beira Flight Information Cen- ter and was informed that there was no known air traffic in our area. \"I called one of the hostesses to the cockpit, so as to corroborate the sighting and we all followed the object until it stood quite close to us and maintained itself parallel to our track and altered its speed to ours. It continued to fltsh red, green and white lights intermittently and appeared to have a diameter of a soccer ball. I switched off the aircrafts* position lights and all other lights so as to avoid this object. To my astonishment the object increased its speed enormously and appeared on our starboard side, increasing and decreasing its speed fre- quently, circled in front of us and followed our aircraft-, at a distance difficult to calculate, for about ten to fifteen minutes, finally chang- ing its course towards the sea and disappeared* \"A complete and most factual report of whst we observed was transmitted on the radio to the Beira Aeronautical Center and, I believe, a tape recording of this was sent to the Military Authorities. \"A report of this sighting was not submitted to the airline 1 s adminis- tration department once there was no danger to the aircraft or the people on board. -Lt was a real surprise to read of this sighting about a month afterwards in the local newspaper. How it got to the press, no one seems to know as we kept this strictly to ourselves, so as to avoid sensationalism or publicity. \"This is the factual, and to the best of my knowledge, the description of wh?t was observed on the flight that night. Please do use this infor- mation if you feel that it may be of interest in helping to solve the UFO phenomenon, considered end believed, by many learned men to be a serious scientific mystery.\" The letter was signed\" Most sincerely yours, Captain Gilberto N. da Costa, DETA Airlines (Mozambique), Lourenco Marques.\" Your editor and all of the SKYLOOK staff extend a warm welcome to the many new subscribers who will begin reeding SKYLOOK with this issue.

This is the latest of the UFO incidents thc.t have had the town talk- ing during the past six months. Mr. Kruger—down to earth and not given to flights of fancy--Scid this week no one had actually seen the UFO, but a strange droning in the night and mysterious \"pad marks\" on his lawn prove his theory. The police were called in, and the District Commandant, Lieut-Col. L. K. Knox, admits he is baffled. Mr. Kruger, who has never taken flying saucers seriously before, said, \"Between J>: 30 and 1+ amm. on Monday my wife end I were woken by a strange droning sound. \"It was the most eerie experiinee 1 have ever had. ue could hear the thing—end a dull light was shining into our bedroom. \"It lasted a little while and tnen disappeared. In all my years I have never had such a weird experience. There T s something unnatural about it; something you can T t explain.\" Mr. Kruger seid ne did not look out of the window \"because the last thing we expected was a UFO on our front\"lawn.\" After the noise and li£;ht disappeared they were not unduly worried. \"The only thing is we could not get back to sleep. Eventually 1 got up and msde some coffee.\" Mr. Kruger went to work as usual and nothing more vies said about the incident. His wife discovered the marks on Monday evening while watering the garden. \"There we saw the four pad marks, or whatever they are. i got such a fright when I looked at them that tne heir on my arms stood on end.\" The marks, coupled with the events the previous night, convinced the Krugers they had been visited by a UFO. \"Something definitely landed there,\" i>.r. Kruger said. \"There are four oval marks, 23cm long and 15cm broed, clearly visible as the grass is dying and turning yellow. Inside each oval the grass is still green. The marks form an area three metres long and 1 1/3 metres wide. (bnd of Article) On May 12, another article appreared in the Press, and this one reported that Bill Dyke, end G. D. Whitehead, interested in UFOs and believing they have seen some, visited the Kruger home. Gerber took his UFO detector, a machine imported from Switzerland, and placed it over one of the pad marks. The machine recorded a negative magnetic field result. But the test for gamma rays proved positive—the first time the machine had given a positive result. The two and Mr. Kruger also found a scorch mark on a black brick porch pillar close to where the UFO landed. This was seen as further proof of a landing.

UeleJce and Dr. Sidney E. Hodges, both of the university ! s physics department, and Dr. James Sage, of the industrial and technical education department. Following a two week investigation during which the team watched and photographed the weird orange balls of lights on several occasions as chey darted across tne sky at great speed, the scientists are yet unable to give an explanation, but \"concluded the lights are real, very in in- tensity and at times appear to exhibit almost intelligent control as they glide silently across the sky.\" Though not discounting any possibility, Rutledge seid he does not believe the lights are conventional aircraft, satellites, weather balloons marsh gas or plasma balls (balls of electrical energy) as theorized by some other scientists who have studied the phenomena. The team has seen the lights, now they must analyze the data and look for possible answers to the puzzling Piedmont UFOs. \"I felt damned foolish when I first sat on a mountain all night and didn't see anything. But 1 don't anymore,\" Rutledge said. Editor ? s Note: toe've had no recent reports from the Piedmont area end hope our subscribers there will write us if more UFOs are seen.

Mr. \"X !t saw the object approaching from the northeast and called his wife* The object, seen head on as it approached, had the appearance of a metallic brown-gray, round object completely surrounded by a brilliant red light.

She said, \"What do you suppose is wrong with that plane?\" Then both realized there was no sound, as the bright li^nt hovered overhead, One of the women went indoors for the binoculars, and hurried back to view the object which was in sight for about 20 minutes. During this period, they became alarmed and called Mr. Alessio to come and watch the strange happenings. The object, which had come out of the north, moved to the south and then hovered about 30 degrees above the horizon. At this time a shaft of light, orange-white in color, shot down from the object and was followed by \"a lighted cord\" after which \"a lighted object popped out, descending a short distance, then another like the first.\" Other lighted objects continued to drop from the object, and f-irs. Alessio reported they were too excited then to count them. Then \"all of a sudden all of the lights went out\" and nothing more was observed.

They thought it was a star until it started to move at a rapid rate of speed to the south. It gained alititude and was lost to view in about 20 seconds. It was a bright yellow- orange, glowing with an unblinking, steady light. The ^ize was estimated to be that of a dime held at arms length. The sky was clear. There was no sound from the objecto The men\"reported the sighting to Donald Campbell, MUFON Field Investigator. On the night of June 9, at 9:45 o 1 clock, Mr. Campbell was at his home, 303 W. Saunders St., Mt. Pleasant la., and was enjoying the view of the clear, star lit sky. Out of the corner of his eye he suddenly became aware of a bright, orange light to the north and rushed around the corner of the house for a better view. The bright, round object which was about 250 feet high and two blocks distant, was about the size of the moon, and moved in less than 15 seconds to disappear over the Skunk River, 6 miles distanto Mr. Campbell got into his car and drove to Oakland Mills on the river, to ask some friends if they had seen the object.

The sky was clear, and it was about dusk when he reached a flat stretch of road with open fields on each side. Suddenly he noticed what he believed to be a helicopter hover- ing above the field to the right. As he came closer, he saw two saucer-shaped objects silhouetted against the western sky, each with a red light directly on top. The shape of each was compered to that of the bell on the check-in desk at a hotel. Shanks stopped his car to watch the objects, which were side by side and gave off no light other than the light on top. It was difficult to judge their aize or distance from the road, he said. \"If one were to hold clenched fists out at arms length, this is approximately how large they appeared,\" he stated. Several cars stopped along the highway, but Mr. Shanks did not speak to any of the drivers and after watxhing the motionless objects for ten minutes, went on his way. He was making a -visit to his father, who had a heart attack later that night. The UFO sighting seemed very unimportant then and was almost forgotten.

They first appeared to be the size of headlights, j or a street light, then gradually diminished as they moved to the east and became small points of light. Neighbors were called to watch the objects, but no one wanted to notify the police at first for fear of ridicule. Baumbach finally summoned Patrolman ^uben Abbington ebout 10 p.m. when the lights were still large. Abbington called the station and soon five more police car s, a motorcycle patrolman and several off-duty policemen rolled up to watch the spectacle. Detective Darrell Tullock received a call reporting the objects at 11:25 and confirmed the sighting. \"They were the weirdest things I T ve seen, \"Tullock said. He described them as veering off at high speeds, hovering and making \"incredible turns.\" At one point one of the lights began following an airplane that had apparently just taken off from Lambert Field, accelerating until it matched the plane f s speed, then flowing along above it until finally shooting upward. Baumbach, who had been a radar operator in the Air Force and had had several pilots report UFOs, said he was concerned by the lights, especially when they appeared to be growing closer, flying low over the rooftops. \"All I know is that there is no aircraft in this country which will accelerate as fast as those things were going,\" he said. Baumbech said that the airport had been notified when the plane was being escorted by the light, but that attempts to track it with radar had been futile.

Mo. - A light sighted by several area resi- l dents Saturday night, July 14, near Hermitage, Mo. remains an unsolved mystery. Witnesses described the object as an extremely bright light that changed to pink, red, green and blue. Sheriff W. V. Kennedy said he received calls about the light about 10 p.m. and he watched it from his home until it disappeared about an hour later, it appeared to be round and moved at varying speeds. It made no sound and was bright enough to light up the ground around the witnesses ! homes. Reported by T e d Phillips.

Mrs. Clough described one as \"big as the bottom of a tea kettle\" and reported, \"Our dogs and all the dogs inthe neigh- borhood were making an awful racket.\" She said the objects moved swiftly but.silently. Coincident to this sighting is the fact that Jerome Eden had set up his Reich Cloudbuster on the shore of Lake Pend Oreille at 7:45 P.M. Friday. Eden had told the Cloughs \"to keep an eye out for UFOs,\" because the Reich Cloudbuster draws upon the Cosmic Orgone energy which UFOs use as their propulsive power. Eden is currently attempt- ing to break the drought in northern Idaho with the Reich Cloudbustero His weather-modification activities are being duly reported to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAAJ of the De- partment of Commerce, under newly instituted federal regulations. \"I am sure the UFOs are alerted each time 1 use the Reich Cloud- buster,\" Eden said. \"This has happened in the past; but this is the first time that so many UFOs were spotted in our area in one evening.\" The Cloughs said they watched the alien craft from about 10:30 p.m. on Friday evening to around 11:30 p. m.

Okay? Corn Rows Mysteriously Cut Down on Iowa Fcrm - We are indebted to Gary Lowenberg, of ^onnellson,Iowa, for a news clipping from the \"Des Moines Register\" (from the week preceding July 2nd)o We quote: Duane Woodruff, who farms in Warren County east of Ackworth, Wednesday examines two rows of corn that were mysteriously cut down. Woodruff said he discovered the damaged corn about 9 a.nu when he went to cul- tivate the field. He said the corn appeared to be \"chopped off,,\" \"I thought at first someone had been in the field with a corn knife,\" ne said. \"But the ground was soft and if someone had been walking they would have left tracks. There were no tracks of any kind. The chopped-off rows continued down into a waterway, turned left and disappeared.\" The photo shows the farmer kneeling by the rows of cut corn, with the row curving off into the distance. It csn be seen the stalks were cut cleanly, each an equal distance from the ground. The fallen stalks fell to the center, filling the space between the two rows. We'd certainly like to get more on this one. And we did I Word to Director Walt Andrus brought results. He inter- viewed the Woodruffs and learned the cut corn was discovered on June 27. Some stalks were cut at an angle, and some straight across, three to four inches above the ground* The stalks were green and crisp when found at 9 a.m. Ro^er Woodruff, age 22, took off his shoes and walked through the area to determine if he left tracks. He did, and they were the only tracks on the dry soil (there had been no rain for several days). The cutting action went down two rows, then jumped (skipped) 11"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"two rows and continued* Marvin Smart, the Warren County Extension Director, investigated the area and could find no tracks and was unable to offer sriy ex- planation for the incident. The farm is 5 miles east of Indianola, Iowa, on Stste Highway 92. The\"Shady Oaks Golf Bourse is directly ecross the highway from the corn field. Neighbors in the area reported seeing nothing unusual and the happening remains a mystery. It was learned there were some hot air balloon races out of Indian- ola, July 25-29) but there appears to be no relation between them and the cut corn, and we mention them only because someone may have seen a balloon in the area and thought it wf s a UFO.

Stuart 0 T Byrne and his wife live on a mountain top near Silver City, and with other amateur astronomers, often hold \"star parties\" with interested star-gazers assembling to study the sky. To quote now directly from the article: \"0 T Byrne determined ikylab would pass over the Lordsburg-Animas area and would be visible in Silver City at 9-15 p.m. Monday, appearing at tbout eight degrees above the horizon in the northwest. Skylab would be entering its sixth orbit. \"But four minutes earlier than planned, a very bright object appear- ed in the proper path. And then more bright objects appeard. No sooner than there were four or five bright objects, and any one of wiiich could have been the space station, there appeared more bright tumbling obj- ects. \"The group followed all the objects as they approacned the moon and disappeared as they entered the earth's shadow. \"J-t seems Skylab h^d a lot more debris and surplus Hardware orbiting with it than had been expected,,\" Mr. Hudson comments: \"Will be interesting to learri from others that might have viewed Skylab in its ecrly orbits to find out if they also saw this display of satellites going over in s bunch. One can speculate that Skylab might have had some ! visitors' looking it over closely, and then departed for parts unknown. -I have observed Skylab twice, but it was alone up there at the time.\" We invite our readers to comment. Military Aircraft or UFO? Military and civilian police took £ flurry of telephone calls eerly the morning of d une 19, 1973 reporting sight- ings of sn unidentified flying object. \"The Lompoc Record\" (Lompoc, Calif.) said the craft was described by witnesses as a pulsating light that moved at £ variety of speeds, hov- ered, derted behind local hills and emerged again, snd reportedly land- ed in Pine Canyon. A team of air police investigated, but found nothing irregular. According to spokesmen at Vandenberg Air Force Base, there were no military helicopters airborne over Vandenberg at the Lime of the sight- ings and no knowledge of civilian craft aloft. On June 20 the \"Lompoc Record\" reported that an EC-131 aircraft out of Edwards Air Force Base was the probable origin of the UFO sightings. The aircraft, on a periodic missile tracking radar test mission, was over the Vandenbtrg area from 9:15 p.m. Monday night until 1:15 a.m. Tuesday morning and carried a bright white tricking light, base spokes- men said. (Continued on next page] 12"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"Atmospheric distortion of the white beacon, carried by the craft at an altitude of 17,000 feet, could have accounted for the reports of a pulsating light and of red and green lights, base spokesmen said, as could the bwin propeller engine aircraft 1 s normal port and starboard running lights. But at least four oi' six observers who watched what they described as \"a very unusual light\" for about two hours Tuesday morning from a crest in Mission Hills still don't believe what they saw could have been £,n aircraft. Two former Air Force wives, who s&id they've resided near tirbases for 12 and 13 years, related seeing a single light that was a brilliant white and the size of a dime et arm's length when it moved but .hovered as a red spot that went out reappeared as a red pin point and then flashed as brilliantly as a missile staging. The women, who refused to b e identified, said that a green light joined the red one only after an hour or so. They doubt that what they saw was an aircraft, they said, because both lights appeared to hover for periods up to 15 minutes, because only the white-red light made sharp zig zag maneuvers, because both appeared to move very fast and because none of the six observers could hear any engine sounds whatso- ever. \"I don't know if what we saw was a UFO,\" one of the women said. \"But what I saw was a very unusual light which I know was not an airplane* We would sure like to know wh£t it was.\" Credit: Mrs. Idabel Epperson, JViUFON Director for Southern California a Missouri Farmer and Wife See Large UFO - A UFO sighting was reported by Terry Stice. on his farm east of Emden, Mo., at 3:30 a.m. Friday, July 13. Stice said he and his wife, Linda, were awakened by the bark- ing of their dog. When Stice went outside to see what was wrong, he saw an oblong object about the size of a car, moving in a northwest direction about 100 feet from the ground. He said it gave off a red- dish-orange glow and stayed in the sky about ten minutes before dis- appearing in the west. He then heard the neighbors 1 dogs barking down the road. He reported the incident to FAA officials at Baldwin Field near Quincy. After reading the report in the Quincy \"Herald-Whig\", Joe Brill of the SKYLOOK staff went to the Emden home to interview the couple and learned they left Friday for California. n e will see them on their return, and we hope to have more details on this sighting in a later issue-of SKYLOOK. Is Mo Mo Still Around? —Our readers who are interested in \"monster\" stories will recall that Mo Mo made the headlines about this time last year, being seen near Louisiana, Mo., and elsewhere in the state* The July 13, 1973 issue of \"The Salem News\" (Sslem, Mo—^e Ed T s old home town) rep'orts \"One tall end skinny beast has been reported to be scavenging for food in a brush covered area near Wayne-Dale Trailer Court. Eunice Sutton, who lives on Roosevelt Street, reported that she was talking with her mother and a friend in their front yard about 11:30 Wednesday evening when they noticed a movement in a nearby field. It appeared to Miss Sutton 1 s mother to be an unusually thin bear. Miss Sutton estimated the height of the animal to be around six feet, and it was covered with hair.

By Lucius Farish Three recent issues of NATIONAL TATTLER have featured UFO articles of varying lengths. The June 24 issue told of sightings over the north- west side of Chicago during hay of this year. A snail article in the July 1 issue dealt with Prof. Eugene Lundholm, librarian at the Univer- sity of Wisconsin, who plans to search for UFOs throughout the summer. His interest was sparked by the experiences of a young V.'isconsin couple who have apparently been the subjects of an intensive study by UFOs. The Aurora, Texas \"crashed airship\" story is featured in the July 9 issue. This is largely re-hash of newspaper stories* The August issue of FATE contains an article telling of a 1947 UFO sighting in the Florida swamps. An apparent inconsistency in the story suggests that the date should perhaps be 1957, instead of 1947; but at any rate, the report is interesting* Aside from John Keel T s monthly column, the August issue of SAGA con- tains no UFO material. I doubt, however, that this indicates a change of the thinking of SAGA ! s editors. Their UFO articles have drawn a great deal of attention and I feel sure they will continue. Whenever books as controversial as Erich von Daniken's come along, they are bound to provoke detractors. This is not to say that the von Daniken books are perfect and beyond criticism—far from it. However, some of the counter arguments put forward by von Daniken 1 s critics leave a great deal to be desired. Such is the case with a recent book by Dr. Clifford Wilson, CRASH GO THE CHARIOTS. As will be obvious from the title, Dr. Wilson hopes to \"crash\" the ongoing popularity of CHARIOTS OF THE GODS? and GODS FROM OUTER SPACE with his refutations. Dr. Wilson, a Biblical scholar and archaeologist, seems most upset with von Daniken's \"interpretations\" of Biblical events, although he also lashes out at a number of other things. Unfortunately, rather than being a reasoned and well-balanced alternative to the theories set forth by von Daniken, tnis is merely another example of the \"it-isn't-true-because-it-can T t-be-true\" sort of thinking. One is tempted to say that Dr. Wilson's rebuttal is also headed for a \"crash\", but actually it can't—it never got off the ground! His book is available from Lancer Books, Inc., 1560 Broadway, N. Y., N. Y. 10036 for $1.25. ~~ Certainly one of the better volumes to come along in quite some time I is FLYING SAUCER REPORT: UFOs UNIDENTIFIED UNDENIABLE by Ro^.er H. Stanway 7 & Anthony R. Pace. Basically, it is an in-depth analysis of the Autumn 1967 I UFO flap in England. The book is crammed full of reports, maps, drawings, j photos, charts and other pertinent data. The edition now available has I been revised slightly to include various Appendices containing correspon- / dence between the authors and the Ministry of Defense relating to some of the UFO reports. The book is available from Newchapel Observatory, V_£toke-on-Trent,- Staffordshire, England for $4.00. Checks should be made payable to \"Newchapel Observatory UFO Report.\" Highly recommended. Many readers may not know that Aime Michel's excellent book FLYING SAUCERS AND THE STRAIGHT-LINE MYSTERY is still available in hardcover. Michel's introduction of \"orthoteny\" into UFO research was certainly a milestone even though the concept seems to have been discounted to a certain extent today. Dr. David Saunders T American studies of orthotenic lines are perhaps bhe best known of the current projects.

I live in the 23rd ward of Bucharest and I was returning home from work.

Walking across the street from the \"Republica\" works 1 sighted direct- ly above the factory (about 45 degrees above the horizon) an object with a blue-greenish color. The color was that of the color of the spark on the power lines of a street car. The curious part was that it had some very shiny thorns, in length about half of the entire object. T s length, and very pointed at the tips^but much thicker at their base, ^-t looked like a hedge-hog*\" Q. Were these beams emitted by the object? A. No, I don't believe so. The thorns had a very clear outline. Q. At what height was this object? A. I can not say precisely. I can only say that it was between the upper layer of clouds on which it was projecting and the lower layer of clouds that it hid behind for a few moments. Q. Could it have been a simple celestial body such as a star? Ao No. The sun was not yet up. Even if I was mistaken about the time within a few minutes, the sun would not have been at such a height at that time in the horizon. The moon was not in that location. There were no stars visible.

A. I had the impression it was moving towards me. Q. Wasn't there anyone else on the street at this hour? A. Oh yes, there were housewives .that were going shopping. It is very probable that more people saw it, but I didn ! t talk with anyone, nor did I stop. Q. Are you sure that you did not have an illusion of some sort? A. My specialization is psychology and I know the meaning and what an optical illusion is. I know it was no optical illusion,, I have never had such an experience and I believe it would be very difficult that one could have an optical illusion for some 15 minutes and see only this one object very distinctly.
