As such, he has been encouraged by such individuals as Dr. Michael Lieb of the University of Illinois, author of C///7- dren ofEzekiel, and Dr. Barry Downing, MUFON consultant in theology and au- thor of the classic book on the topic. The Bible ami Flying Saucers. On the other hand, as Carlisle points out, Biblical scholar Mike Heiser consid- ers the material \"utterly bogus,\" stating that \"there are hundreds of artistic repre- sentations of the merkabah throne from Ezekiel's day (and prior and after), and none look anything like a modern UFO of any type.\" Regardless of whether Carlisle gains acceptance within the overall community of Biblical scholars, it does appear that he has presented a superior description of Ezekiel's \"chariot\" to that of former NASA engineer Josef Blumrich in his book The Spaceships ofEzekiel. While it is desirable to present as much background as possible, there is no way that the Journal can present the exten- sive research assembled by Carlisle, in- cluding the detailed analyses of various passages in numerous sources. However, he is completing a manu- script for a book on this topic, which he expects to be published in March of 2003. In the meantime, he can be contacted at exegetical@email.msn.com by those de- siring additional details. Dr Downing NASA s Joseph Blumrich came up with this concept of the object de- scribed by Ezekiel. Propellers? October 2003 Introduction By Dr. Barry Downing MUFON Theology Consultant Students of UFOs are familiar with the idea that the biblical \"wheels ofEzekiel\" may have been some kind of spaceship, as noted by veteran researcher Walter Webb in the entry on \"Ezekiel's Wheel\" in The Encyclopedia of Extraterrestrial En- counters, edited by Ronald Story. And, of course, NASA scientist Jo- seph Blumrich wrote a book, The Spaceships of Ezekiel that in- cluded a drawing that he believed repre- sented what Ezekiel saw. Hebrew and Semitic scholar Zechariah Sitchin, in his recent book, Divine Encounters, treats the Blumrich study with approval. Some students of the biblical tradition assume that when Ezekiel said he had \"visions of God,\" that this means Ezekiel was involved in more of a psychological experience than a physical one. Thus in The Bible and Flying Saucers, I focused almost exclusively on the Exodus, mak- ing only passing comments on Ezekiel. Likewise, secular scholars such as Michael Lieb, in books such as Children ofEzekiel. focus on the poetic and psy- chological power of the Ezekiel story, see- ing Ezekiel more as religious mystery than as science. But modern students of UFOs know that many UFO close encounters seem to distort reality in the mind of the \"experiencer\" as we sometimes call UFO witnesses. Thus, even if we suppose that Ezekiel had a vision of his famous \"wheels\" in some kind of altered state of consciousness, that still means that it is important to try to understand what Ezekiel believes he saw. Whatever kind of \"reality\" UFOs are, we need to be able to describe that reality as accurately as possible, and if biblical people had these same kinds of encoun- ters, we need to translate what biblical people saw as accurately as. possible. The purpose of Frank Carlisle's article is to give a more careful analysis of chap- ters 1 and 10 of the book ofEzekiel, ex- ploring in particular the possibilities of translating the original Hebrew in a way MUFON UFO Journal Car/isle About the author Frank Carlisle majored in French and had a dual minor in history and English at San Diego State University. His indepen- dent scholarship encompasses eight years of biblical studies. He is proficient in biblical Hebrew and has \"an understanding\" of Koine Greek. Carlisle has a particu- lar interest in the book of Ezekiel, and has also examined the vari- ous early Jewish and Gnostic Christian Ezekiel-related litera- ture, as well as other ancient Near Eastern texts related to the Old Testament. Carlisle is also a specialist in other areas of the biblical text, and plans to write at least four books on di fferent topics, the first of which is a book on Ezekiel, which he expects to be edited and ready for publication by March of 2004. Carlisle has done extensive research in the Dead Sea Scrolls non-biblical texts, such as the two he examines as part of his analysis of the biblical Ezekiel text, and also has \"a keen interest\" in the para- biblical texts, such as the book of 1 Enoch, as well as the other Enochic writings, which includes the Aramaic Enochic text fragments of the Dead Sea Scrolls. that gives us a clearer understanding of what Ezekiel believes he saw. What we will discover is that the best translation indicates that Ezekiel saw something like a double convex-shaped UFO, very much like those we have de- scribed in modern times as flying saucers. This means the design of the UFO is quite different from the one envisioned by Jo- seph Blumrich. The research By Frank Carlisle T he Old Testament abounds with texts that speak of heavenly, angelic chariots, which are de- scribed as \"horses\" and chariots of God, and of the heavenly ascensions of cer- tain of the Old Testament prophets into such angelic vehicles. There are also many references in the biblical text to the chariot in which God Page 3"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"himself came when he visited the earth. The noted biblical scholar Dr. Geza Vermes makes the following statement about God's chariot, which is identified in the early Jewish literature as being a \"Merkabah,\" which, literally translated, means \"throne-chariot.\" The biblical prophet, Ezekiel, describes God's Merkabah as being both a \"throne\" and as \"the Glory of the Lord\" and \"the Glory of the God of Israel.\" Vermes clearly establishes the fact these are references to God's Throne-Chariot. He also estab- lishes the fact that the cherubim are also heavenly chariots: \"The divine Throne-Chariot draws its inspiration from Ezekiel (1-10).. .It depicts the appearance and movement of the Merkabah, the divine chariot supported and drawn by the cherubim, which is at the same time a throne and a vehicle.. .The spirits of the Living God move perpetu- ally with the glory of the chariot.\" The Hebrew word rendered \"glory\" is \"kabod,\" the literal translation of which means \"mass\" or \"substance,\" and is ren- dered by biblical scholars as \"body,\" \"house,\" or \"glory.\" Thus, the Merkabah Glory of the Lord can be interpreted as being a \"construc- tion,\" as a vehicle that has both sub- stance and mass. Many of the early Jewish Merkabah- related writings, as well as the early Griositc Christian writings, have their in- terpretational roots in EzekiePs biblical vision of the Merkabah and the four chari- ots of the cherubim. Both bodies of literature represent Ezekiel's living creatures as heavenly chariots, inside of which were angelic beings. In the section that follows, I will present a wide variety of text sources, all of which represent the Merkabah and Ezekiel's living creatures, wheels within wheels, etc. as wheel-chariots. Of all of the biblical texts that deal with the subject of heavenly chariots, none parallels the description that is found in chapters 1 and 10 of the biblical book of the prophet Ezekiel. In these two chapters Ezekiel de- scribes the physical appearance, opera- tion, and movement of what he describes metaphorically as \"living creatures, burn- ing coals of fire, wheels within wheels, and cherubim,\" all of which are synony- mous terms that describe the \"chariots of God.\" Ezekiel likens the chariots to li ving crea- tures to which he attributes various ana- tomical parts, each of which has a spe- cific anatomical location and associated function. While biblical scholarship has for some time supported an angelic chariot in Ezekiel, and despite the fact that the prophet renders a detailed description of their physical appearance, operation, and movement, scholars have heretofore been unable to render a drawing of its physical appearance that is based on a viable translation of the Hebrew text. One has but to read a few of the vari- ous English bible renderings of Ezekiel Chapter 1 in order to see that each ren- ders various areas of the text differently. One of the reasons for this is that in an- cient Hebrew one word often has mul- tiple meanings that at times differ vastly from each other. As the result of a meticulous examina- tion of the Hebrew text of Ezekiel chap- ters 1 and 10,1 have rendered a new trans- lation of Chapter 1 in which the prophet describes the chariot's physical appear- ance. My new translation allows for a pre- cise drawing of the chariot, revealing it as nothing less than a double-convex sau- cer that is formed by the extension of a connecting upper and lower wing on each of its four quadrants, a composite top- mounted dome, an underside that has rigid, metallic legs, a spinning turbine \"wheel in the middle,\" and a ramp-like en- trance. I will first present Comparative Trans- lations of Ezekiel Chapter 1 and portions of Chapter 10 that represent (1) the King James Version (KJV), or Authorized Ver- sion, and (2) the Revised Standard Ver- sion (NRSV) or Oxford Annotated Bible. I will follow these two English transla- tions with my own translation. The information in these sections will allow the reader to see how various He- brew words are translated differently, and how such renderings bring forth differ- ent interpretations. I will follow the Comparative Transla- tions with a brief interpretive commen- tary. A list of the chariot's anatomical parts, locations, and functions-which will bring my new translation of the chariot's physi- cal appearance, operation, and movement to life-is included as a sidebar on page 7.

Ezekiel Chapter 1 4) And I looked, and, behold, a whirl- wind came out of the north, a great cloud, and a fire infolding itself, and a bright- ness was about it, and out of the midst thereof as the color of amber, out of the midst of the fire. 4) As I looked, a stormy wind came out of the north: a great cloud with bright- ness around it and fire flashing forth con- tinually,\"and in the middle of the fire, some- thing like gleaming amber. 4) And I looked [up into the heavens], and saw a whirlwind come from out of the north; an immense cloud that was sur- rounded by brightness and fire, in the middle of which there was something that looked like [it was made of] gleaming, amber-colored metal. 5) Also out of the midst thereof came the likeness of four living creatures. And this was their appearance; they had the likeness of a man. 5) In the middle of it was something like four living creatures. This was their appearance: they were of human form. 5) And from out of the middle of the fire there came [what looked like] four living creatures. This was their appear- ance; they had the likeness of a man [in- side; 1:10, 20, 21; 10:2; 4Q385, frag. 4:11-12; 4Q405,frags. 6 and 23] 6) And every one had four faces and every one had four wings. 6) Each had four faces, and each of them had four wings. 6) but each of them had four faces and four wings. 7) And their feet were straight feet; and the sole of their feet was like the sole of a calf's foot: and they sparkled like the color of burnished brass. 7) Their legs were straight, and the soles of their feet were like the sole of a calf's foot: and they sparkled like bur- nished bronze. 7) Their legs were rigid, and the soles of their feet were (round and flat] like the sole of a calf's foot: and they sparkled like burnished [amber-colored] brass- [like metal; 1:13,16]. 8) And they had the hands of a man under their wings on their four sides; and they four had their faces and their wings. 8) Under their wings on their four sides, they had human hands. And the four had their faces and their wings thus: 8) They each had manlike hands [that were capable of opening and closing; 10:7,8] under their wings on each of their/our quadrants; and they each had their four faces and their four wings. 9) Their wings were joined one to an- other; they turned not when they went; they went every one straightforward.

Their wings were spread out above; each creature had two wings, each of which touched the wing of another, while two covered their bodies. 11) Such were their faces: [Two of] their [four] wings bisected [horizontally, under the dome; 1:23] from the top; two wings on each [quadrant] fastened to- gether [at the distal point; 1:23], and two wings [extended horizontally, from be- neath; 1:23, and thus], concealed their [hollow, central] bodies. 12) And they went every one straight forward: whither the spirit was to go, they went; and they turned not when they went. 12) Each moved straight ahead; wher- ever the spirit would go, they went, with- out turning as they went. 12) And they moved straight forward: wherever the [living] spirit [located in- side of the wheel; 1:20,21,4Q385 frag. 4:11-12.4Q405 frag. 23] desired to go, the living creatures moved and, [in so doing], they did not turn [their wings from a horizontal position; 1:9,14,17. 10:11]. 13) As for the likeness of the living creatures, their appearance was like burn- ing coals of fire, and like the appearance of lamps: it went up and down among the living creatures: and the fire was bright, and out of the fire went forth lightning. 13) In the middle of the living crea- tures was something that looked like burn- ing coals of fire, like the appearance of torches moving to and fro among the liv- ing creatures; the fire was bright, and lightning issued from the fire. 13) As for the likeness of the living creatures [as I perceived them in the heavens], they looked like |fiery, amber- colored] burning coals of fire that had [spinning] lights within them that moved about randomly [1:16,10:2] and the fire was bright, and from the fire [fiery coals] there came forth [what appeared like] flashes of lightning. 14) The living creatures ran and re- turned as the appearance of a flash of lightning. 14) The living creatures darted to and fro, like a flash of lightning. 14) And the living creatures [chari- ots] darted to and fro [through the heav- ens] like flashes of lightning [maneu- vering with great speed, and abruptly changing their direction; 1:9,14,17], without turning [their wings to either side] as they moved. 15) Now as I beheld the living crea- tures, behold one wheel upon the earth by the living creatures, with his four faces. 15) As I looked at the living creatures. I saw a wheel on the earth beside the liv- ing creatures, one for each of the four of them. 15) And as I looked, one of the living creatures [landed/stood] on the earth, [I then perceived it as being] a wheel [that joined] on the side of the four-faced liv- ing creature [which is to say that it at- tached to the chariot's side, under and around its top-mounted dome, of which the four faces are a composite part]. 16) The appearance of the wheels and their work was like unto the color of a beryl and they four had one likeness: and their appearance and their work was as it were a wheel in the middle of a wheel. 16) As for the appearance of the wheels and their construction; their ap- pearance was like the gleaming of beryl; and the four had the same form, their con- struction being something like a wheel within a wheel. 16) The appearance of the wheels and their construction was like [the spar- kling, amber color of the sparkling, gem- stone] Tarshish; and they each had the same [circular] shape: and their appear- ance and their operation was as if there were a [smaller, spinning; 1:13,10:2,13] wheel in the middle of a [greater] wheel [1:8,9,15]. 17) When they went, they went upon their four sides: and they turned not when they went. 17) When they moved, they moved in any of the four directions without veer- ing as they moved. 17) And when they moved [through the heavens], they moved in any direction, and in so doing, they did not turn their wings [from a horizontal position] as they moved. 18) As for their rings, they were so high that they were dreadful; and their rings were full of eyes round about them four. 18) Their rims were tall and awesome, for the rims of all four were full of eyes all around. 18) As for their [circular, hollow, arched] backs, they were tall and awe- some, and were encircled by [round] eyes. 19) And when the living creatures went, the wheels went by them: and when the living creatures were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up. 19) When the living creatures moved, the wheels moved beside them; and when the living creatures rose from the earth, the wheels rose. 19) And when the living creatures moved, the wheels [which joined to their side] moved beside them. And when the living creatures lifted up from off of the earth, the wheels also lifted up beside them [1:15]. 20) Whithersoever the spirit was to go they went, whither was their spirit to go; and the wheels were lifted up over against them: for the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels. 20) Wherever the spirit would go, they went, and the wheels rose along with them; for the spirit of the living creatures was in the wheels. 20) Wherever the [living, angelic be- ing or spirit] desired to go, and the wheels rose along with them, for there was a liv- ing spirit inside of the wheels [4Q385 frag. 4, and 4Q405 frags. 4,6,23]. 21) When those went, these went; and when those stood, these stood; and when those were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up over against them: for the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels. 21) When they moved, the others moved; and when they stopped, the oth- ers stopped; and when they rose from the earth, the wheels rose along with them. 21) When the living creatures moved, the wheels moved [as they are in the same]; and when the living creatures stood [landed] on the earth, the wheels also stood, because there was a living spirit inside of the wheels [who navigated them]. 22) And the likeness of the firmament upon the heads of the living creature was as the color of the terrible crystal, stretched forth over their heads above. 22) Over the heads of the living crea- Page 6 MUFON UFO Journal October 2003"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"tures there was something like a dome, shining like crystal, spread out above their heads. 22) And there was something that looked like an awesome, [clear] crystal dome that spread out over the head [portion] of the living creatures. 23) And under the firmament were their wings straight, the one towards the other: every one had two, which covered on this side, and every one had two, which covered on that side, their bodies. 23) Under the dome their wings were stretched out straight, one toward another; and each of the living creatures had two wings covering its body. 23) And under the dome, their wings were horizontal, the one [extended at an angle] towards the other [thus, two wings fasten together at the distal point; 1:11; on their four quad- rants; 1:8|; two wings covered their [hollow, central; 10:2,7,8,] bodies on the left side/quadrant and two wings covered their bodies on the right side/quadrant. 24) And when they went I heard the noise of their wings, like the noise of great waters, as the voice of the Almighty, the voice of speech, as the noise of a host: and when they stood, they let down their wings. 24) When they moved, I heard the sound of their wings like the sound of mighty waters, like the thunder of the Almighty, a sound of tumult like the sound of an army; when they stopped, they let down their wings. 24) And when the living creatures [chariots] moved, I heard the sound of their wings [3:13,1 Enoch 57:1-2], like the sound of roaring water, like the voice of the Almighty, the voice of speech, like the tumultuous sound of an army: and when they stood [landed] upon the earth, they ceased their wings [from making the sound they made while in flight].

Interpretive commentary The fact that the chariot is circular is well established in the Location and function of chariot's anatomical parts The Head: The chariot's head-portion consists of a dome that is made of a clear, crystal-like material and occupies the chariot's superior-most position. It is part of the chariot's top-mounted, composite dome, the crys- tal head serving as a rotating, navigational dome. The Four Faces: Three of the four faces are insig- nias that are part of a circular ring-like unit that con- nects superiorly to the clear domed head, occupying the chariot's mid-portion, and inferiorly with station- ary, hollow and arched back. The face identified as \"the face of a man\", or \".human face\", is of the chariot's angelic pilot, who sits in the chariot's navigational dome. The Back (rings/rims): The arched, hollow back occupies the lower part of the chariot's composite dome. It is encircledby eyes, which confirms the fact that it is also circular. The encircling eyes are explained below. The Eyes: The eyes surround the chariot's hollow, arched back. The eyes are round and function as ports for looking out from the chariot's hollow, top-mounted dome. The Wings: The wings give the chariot its overall circular or wheel-like shape. The chariot has two hori- zontal wings on each of its four quadrants that extend at an angle, the one towards the other thus connecting together at the distal point. The wings are for flight.. The wheel in the middle of the wheel: The greater wheel references the chariot's overall shape, which is circular like a wheel. The wheel in the middle of the greater wheel is a spinning, turbine-like wheel, which could function as the chariot's propulsion sys- tem. The Body: The body is the hollow, central portion of the chariot that is concealed by two horizontally-ex- tended, connecting wings that are present on each of the (circular) chariot's four quadrants, and, like the com- posite dome, is an inhabitable part of the chariot. The function of the opening hand that is located \"under their wings on their four quadrants\" is established be- low. The Legs: The legs are straight and unbending, and provide support for the chariot while standing on the ground. Thus, they are incapable of movement or \"walking\" on the ground. The four legs are position underneath the chariot's wings and are attached to the chariot's body-portion which is \"covered\" on all four. quadrants by the \"two covering wings.\" The legs are made of a polished amber-colored metal that are likened to highly polished brass. The Feet: The feet are round and flat, like the sole of a calf's foot, and are made of the same material as the legs. Their round, flat, beveled shape provides the chariot the ability to stand in a level position on the ground. The Hand: The opening and closing hand is located under the chariot's wings and functions as an entrance into its hollow, central body. The Spirit of the Living Creature: This references the angelic spirit(s), inhabitant(s), or living beings that are stated in the biblical text to be located \"inside of the wheel.\" It also references \"the face of the man.\" October 2003 MUFON UFO Journal Page?"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"construction, and also describes the op- eration of the spinning propulsion wheel located in the middle of its underside. The New Jerusalem Bible renders a definitive variant of Ezekiel 1:18, in which it states: \"Their circumference was of awe-inspiring size.\" This rendering, no doubt, reflects the translators' under- standing of verse 16, as I translate and interpret it. While verse 6 states that the chariot has four wings, verse 8 seemingly con- tradicts that reading, as it states that the chariot has wings, in the plural, on its four quadrants. This is why, in Ezekiel 10:21 ,the Greek language Ezekiel translations render a variant (a reading that varies from that of original text) from the Hebrew text (which states that each chariot has four wings), and renders \"eight wings.\" This rendering is one that can only be interpreted as an acknowledgement by the Greek translators of the fact that the circular chariot has two wings on four quadrants. There simply is no other ex- planation for the variant translation. Ezekiel describes two different visual/ descriptive perspectives, one in which he describes two wings on two quadrants, as in verses 11 and 23, and as a spinning wheel within the middle of a (greater) wheel, which is the description of the wings as they extend on all four quad- rants. Thus verses 11 and 23 describe a total of four wings. Verse 23 states that the chariot has two horizontal, connecting wings, as \"two ones covering\" and \"two ones covering.\" The repetition of the phrase denotes the fact that Ezekiel de- scribes two of the chariot's quadrants. The description is of two wings on the left and two wings on the right quadrant, or four wings. , Verse 11 also describes how two wings bisect from the top (under the composite dome of verse 23), as two upper wings, and two wings that covered the chariot s (central) body, which is the description of the chariot's two lower wings. Since verse 23 establishes that all of the chariot's wings extend horizontally, the one towards the other, the wings that are described in verse 11 as covering the body must also be horizontal. While verse 23 describes two on the chariot's left and right quadrants, verse 11 describes two upper and two lower wings, which also represents two quad- rants and four wings. Additionally, the Hebrew word for wings is derived from a root meaning to be level or horizontal and thus the wings are to be seen as such. Verse 15 is one that has been incor- rectly translated in all of the English Bibles that I have examined. The wheel in this verse is one that joins to the side of the chariot, under the four-faced, composite dome. It is the greater wheel of verse 16. The wheel is not beside or next to the chariot, as most English Bibles render a Hebrew word that is derived from a root meaning to join. Thus, the wheel should be seen to join onto the chariot's side, as in my translation of verse 15. Once one understands how the chariot's wings fasten together to form a double-convex saucer, and that the wings extend under a central composite dome, it is easy to conceptualize and discern the rest of the chariot's anatomical parts. The dome of verse 23 is a composite unit, the uppermost part of which con- sists of a rotating, clear, crystal naviga- tional dome. There are several induce- ments with the text to support this trans- lation and interpretation. One lies in the fact that the Hebrew word for head literally means the upper most part, and by analogy can also be rendered as the top. Additionally, the word head is derived from a Hebrew root meaning to shake. Thus, it can be seen to be a head that both occupied the uppermost portion of the dome, but can also be seen as a head that is capable of rotation, as is the nor- mal anatomical function of the head, as it turns in conjunction with the face/s as a composite unit. The Hebrew word for face is one that presents one that is capable of turning. This is why Ezekiel 10:11 states: \"...but to the place (direction) that the face looked (faced), they (the wheel-chariot) followed it; they turned not as they went\" (King James Bible). In verse 18, the Hebrew word that is rendered rings/rims in most English Bibles, is a word that specifically means back/s. Since Ezekiel describes a living creature with various anatomical parts, the reference should be to its back, and not its rings or rim, which is also part of the composite dome. The root of the Hebrew word back means to be hollow or arched. The refer- ence in verse 18 is clearly to a hollow, arched back that is encircled with eyes, which are round viewing ports. The back, therefore, is also circular. The Greek Ezekiel translation renders the word back and, while the King James Bible errantly renders rings in 1:18, it correctly renders backs in Ezekiel 10:12. Three of the chariot's four faces are insignias that are part of the rotational rings that it described in the section on the chariot's anatomical parts, locations, and functions. In his article \"The Wheels of Ezekiel,\" R. Cedric Leonard states, \"All four ve- hicles bore insignias on them which de- noted their universal or 'star ship' sta- tus.\" Biblical scholar Dr. Arnold Murray also holds that the faces were insignias. Verse 24 has also been incorrectly translated in the English Bibles, whereby they state that after the chariot landed on the earth they \"let down\" their wings. Since I have well established the fact that the chariot is a double-convex saucer with fixed wings, one can easily see that the chariot could not lower its wing. The Hebrew word rendered as the col- lective let down, is from a single word that also means to cease. Thus, one can see that after the chariot lands on the ground, it ceases making the noise that it generated while in flight. This is why R. Cedric Leonard states the following: \"It would seem natural that after these vehicles had landed and the glowing cloud of plasma had dissipated and the fiery exhausts and rotating lights had ceased, that Ezekiel could better evaluate the physical appearance of the craft.\" While there is much more that I could say to justify my various translations, the constraints of an article length presenta- tion must, therefore, limit my commentary. The comments herein represent only a small portion of my textual analysis and other related research. I believe that with these interpretive comments, as well as the other material that I have presented, that one will be able to discern whether or not Ezekiel describes a flying saucer.

Alien Conspiracy: Unrav- eling the UFO/Alien Mystery) Most ufologists, today, would agree that the flying saucer mystery began sometime around the mid-Forties. Reports of foo-fighters started to sur- face by the end of WWII. By 1947 public sightings, witnessed by reputable citizens such as Kenneth Arnold, became widely publicized. Soon, the Air Force branch of the War Department engaged in a classified study of the phenomenon while holding the public at bay. However, we find quite a few civilians who were not so patient during this ambiguous time of silence, as reports of sightings only continued. Thus, an emerging grassroots core-group had become persistent on getting the answers. Among them were pilots, retired ser- vicemen, and news reporters. This was a time in American history when expecta- tions toward government openness were much higher-as some felt that, even then, the public was losing more footing in the process of policy making. Civilian advocates such as Marine Maj. Donald Keyhoe and journalist Frank Scully had soon undertaken their own in- vestigations. They interviewed many per- sonal sources and followed-up leads on various reports. After a period of about two years, the bulk of what we now view as the foundational elements of ufology were boldly proclaimed. In 1950, Frank Scully 's Behind the Fly- ing Saucers set the stage for what may be viewed as \"the mother of all alien crash tales.\" He purported to have pierced what he considered was a deliberate veil of secrecy, while drawing his information from a volume of sources. These included eight scientists he re- ferred to collectively as \"Dr. Gee.\" But the veteran journalist soon became a tar- get for those who appeared to be \"tight- ening the lid\" on the UFO issue and its related leaks, and may well have been one of the first ufologists systematically dis- credited by the establishment. What is key to the credibility of Scully's story are the actual details-and in particular, the identity of \"Dr. Gee.\" Toward the end of his book, Scully in- troduced one scientist in the guise of a \"surprise witness,\" much as a cunning attorney might do in hopes of sealing the outcome of his case. Scully claimed that this final witness was a leading scientist of his day-notably, equal in stature to an Albert Einstein. This is the leading sci- entist we intend to reveal. Scully soon unleashed an incredible story, alleging such astounding new rev- elations as recovered crashed-saucers in the American Southwest, small dead aliens, autopsies of their bodies, govern- ment coverups, secret projects, super materials, alien artifacts, hieroglyphic markings, food wafers, dark-blue uni- forms, dematerialization, magnetic propul- sion, magnetic stalling effects on ve- hicles, geomagnetic faults, planetary ori- gins of aliens and beyond. All of these and more can be found in Scully's book, which actually acquired some of its elements well before 1950. Scully was well liked by his contempo- raries, was a good statesman, and took his character assassination personally. It appears that he was set up to look like a fool, in that his sources were said to be two con men, accused of perpetrat- ing a monstrous hoax. Reflecting upon the Maury Island Incident, it may be seen that Frank Scully's circumstance was similar to Kenneth Arnold's. Scully became involved with m-o men who were (in final public opinion) ac- cused of a monstrous hoax-just as Fred Crisman and Harold Dahl were in the Maury Island incident. Chris Evans About the author Chris Evans is the author of Alien Con- spiracy: Unraveling the UFO/Alien Mys- tery (Alarm Clock Publishing, 2003, reviewed in the August, 2003, Journal). His background in- cludes robotic design and engi- neering, as well as \"amateur sci- entist and inven- tor.\" Currently a resident of West Virginia, Evans has done extensive research in the history of UFOs, as well as what abductions may reveal about the Alien agenda(s). When police investigators search for a culprit, they first carefully examine those who tend to have the strongest motive. Judge for yourself who might have had a motive in the Maury Island case. A simi- lar motive could have been aimed at Frank Scully only a couple of years later. At the beginning of Scul ly 's book it is curious to note that he used the preface [nearly five pages] to blast the government's abuse of control and se- crecy in their efforts to debunk UFO mat- ters. It should be emphasized here that Scully reported several UFO incidents (and various other crashes) before, dur- ing, and after the release of his book. The reason for such emphasis is that, later, there were many critics and debunk- ers who seemed to make it a point to men- tion Scully only as one who reported a crash near Aztec, NM. That is a gross understatement considering Scully's unique importance as a key figure in the foundation of ufology and his various articles, testimonies, and cumulative con- tributions to the field. Scully was allegedly told insider sto- ries about recovered, crashed saucers (five in all) that contained small alien oc- cupants, found dead at the scene. Some of those appeared to have been \"charred,\" while those found at other crash sites did not. One of the crashes was considered so violent that there was little of distinction to recover from it—bodies or otherwise. The saucer that was described as being October 2003 MUFON UFO Journal Page 9"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"severely \"cracked up\" might seemingly correspond to the Roswell event, since: (1) the wreckage found at Brazel's ranch was badly \"cracked up,\" and (2) Scully was told that one saucer had \"come down on a ranch.\" Could these and similar elements have served to support claims that there was already a diligent effort underway to con- ceal any possible,knowledge (or further interest) in the Roswell case? Scully's sources claimed to have become involved in post-recovery operations-and studies of alien craft-by 1949. In the early part of his book, Scully argued that there had been an agreement between the press and the Department of Defense to ignore such stories during the two years of the Air Force's official in- vestigation. Thus, we see an early indi- cation that the press had possibly yielded to being controlled, and their further will- ingness to gloss-over the facts when de- livering the news (or a lack of it) regard- ing UFOs. Critics and debunkers tend to focus only on the \"Aztec\" crash scenario, or only on those elements that might be linked to a man named Silas Newton. But Scully developed a heightened interest in the subject of UFOs as early as 1945, and he stayed abreast of matters until his death in 1964. One example of this surfaced during a phone interview with his daughter Nonny. She informed me that Scully sustained a keen interest in the abduction cases of Betty and Barney Hill from the time that their incident first occurred. But his inter- est in hew scientific theories and philoso- phy, and the depth of detail he pursued, may be additional evidence of his discus- sions with that top scientist: the \"surprise witness\" for his defense. The Chief Scientist Take a deep breath. You are about to be introduced to one of the most prolific pundits of the modern era: a scientist, a philosopher; but also a statesman and so- cial figure; truly, a renaissance man of immeasurable talents. .He was born in 1871, but was noted to revolutionize an era before he died, the same year as did JFK, 1963. Some of you who intensely follow certain cutting-edge subjects may recognize his name. Many, on the other hand, will have never heard ofhim. Have you heard such terms as Atomic Theory or Cosmogony? He advanced these at the turn of the last century. Have you heard of Nicola Tesla or Albert Einstein? He was revered as a mentor by these men. Have you heard of the New World Order or even Sacred Geometry, or Zero Point Energy? Universal Wave Theory? He was the punctuate, modern inspi- ration behind originating many such con- cepts, yet some of these have become given over to the interpretations of oth- ers, who later capitalized on his work. Have you heard of the philosophy of Cosmic Consciousness? He is also the one from whom such a term is taken. Have you heard of Global Warming or the dan- gers of Ozone Depletion, or Atomic Sui- cide? (later called Mutually Assured De- struction). What about Superstring Physics or the Apollo 14propulsion system? Amazingly, these feats represent but quite a short list of things he had become the father of, or was involved with. He, along with his wife, who often wrote and assisted him, may likely be the most plagiarized individuals of the mod- ern era! There are many who now pro- mote or appear to take credit for even these few milestones we have mentioned. Still, there are many readers who may yet be wondering, \"Who on earth are you talking about?\" We will get to that. But the main rea- son he is being mentioned here is due to his involvement with issues in the field of ufology-more so with that scenario go- ing back to the Fifties: the scenario that involved Frank Scully and his insider rev- elations about alleged crashed saucers, alien artifacts, alien bodies, and a host of other features that have intrigued the masses, while serving as much of the foundation behind the modern view of ufology. However, while some may still not be certain of the name of our \"mystery sci- entist,\" many others have long forgotten that prolific story (and its finer elements) as told by Frank Scully. ! That brings us to a fleeting term we call \"history,\" and how our true percep- tion of \"what\" and \"who\" has influenced it has come to be formed. And for those who hope to recapture certain important truths about that era of science and history, it becomes impera- tive to take a second look at the claims (and more so, the science, society, and influences) that were covered in Frank Scully's book, Behind the Flying Sau- cers. Since I have treated his story in my book (Alien Conspiracy), I will not, thus, be recapping those elements here. But rather I will merely suggest that those who have the opportunity should attempt to read Scully's book again, and read it care- fully. Even Scully himself was somewhat enigmatic, and was a person who has acted to shape certain parts of history. He was a.secretary and ghost writer for Frank Harris as Scully wrote the majority of Harris' Bernard Shaw, a unauthorized biography. Harris had become ill, and his memories were apparently fading by the end of the Roaring Twenties. Scully did his best to recover Harris' notes and complete this important work in light of the circumstances. Yet this is the same Scully who wrote a book seeking to reveal a multitude of secrets pertaining to \"flying saucers,\" and to a similar degree of magnitude, the higher scientific knowledge and input of another man: the \"mystery scientist\" we began describing above. Briefly, Scully referred to several sci- entific figures while using various terms such as \"chief scientist,\" \"the doctor,\" \"geophysicist,\" \"leading magnetic scien- tist,\" \"director of government projects,\" and other such terms. He had created a fictitious, general caricature that he mostly referred to as \"Dr. Gee\" in order to relate quite a large and complicated body of technical infor- mation and related facts, pertaining to the sightings of UFOs and related rumors of crashes and artifacts. His \"revelations\" were viewed as a disclosure by some, as a \"severe leak\" by others, and ultimately as a \"hoax\" by a large faction of the public who appear to have been duped by a clever ploy. The circumstances have remained clouded in confusion, persisting as a terse subject for schismatic debates ever since. During the later part of 1997 and through part of 1998,1 interviewed and communicated with many of Scully's sur- viving family: his daughters Frani, Pat, Page 10 MUFON UFO Journal October 2003"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"Nonny, Moreen, and also Nonny's close friend, David Hellman. I asked many ques- tions about who Scully had been in con- tact with during those days,_ in light of ' his interests and activities related to \"fly- ing saucers.\" My jaw began to drop as I heard cer- . tain descriptions and circumstances sur- rounding a visit Scully received by an eminent yet humble scientist. The names involved were not entirely recalled by some of the Scully children after so many years. At the time, I was researching the whole debacle that emerged due to his book, and the subsequent shenanigans launched by debunkers, critics, and the .like. For those who have further interest, quite a few of the details.are covered in my book. But I am convinced that Scully .and his wife, Alice, were true to their .prom- ises of secrecy, and had not openly re- vealed 4he names of those providing, in- formation, nor the identity of that great man who \"dropped by the house one day.\" ' ' ' However, I provide the following for those dedicated ufologists who have scoured the data over the years, while I trust that those who are sincere and knowledgeable will have little trouble in connecting the dots, or \"putting two and two together,\" especially after reading the material I am about to provide. Again, I also recommend a re-reading of Scully's book, while carefully noting the nature and origins of the scientific concepts that were described, while not- ing those incredible influences and trends that have arisen from the work of that astounding visionary and trend set- ter of the last century: the disciplined, humble, pervasive genius and member of the Twilight Club who visited Frank Scully in those days.

(Check, MO, or cash, U.S. dollars.) one other than Scully himself, that visitor and mystery scientist was the eminent Dr. WalterRussell.(l 871-1963).  •- - - -A further connection to Russell may come to light upon considering that Henry Holt (publisher of Scully's book) was also a member of the Twilight Club: a group that became formed by various literary pundits, scientists, businessmen, states- men and the like, in pursuit of ethical and gracious precepts toward the future of the country. As I prepared to write this disclosure, I soon became dumbfounded by the enor- mity and extent of Dr. Russell's influence upon so many features of science and philosophy that are in vogue today. But he was always; seemingly, in the back- ground .of the public view. This may be due, in part, to the fact that his beliefs were quite controversial to a society that was predominately fundamental Chris- .tian, and, further, reactionary to the Spiri- tualism movement of the turn of the last century. Russell was, of course, lumped into all of that. Yet possibly one of the greatest testi- monies to his genius is the fact that the brilliant Nicola Tesla is noted to have con- fessed that Russell's theories were \"one hundred years ahead\" of their time. Looking back, we are able to agree with Tesla, as only recently have Russell's concepts become so widespread, and, with the Internet, so widely discussed: world crisis, atomic suicide, the secret of light, global warming, zero point energy, universal wave theory, ozone depletion, loss of atmospheric oxygen, wave dynam- ics and harmonics; even, cosmic con- sciousness and the origin of life. However, it should be emphasized that the only way to. view these in the intrin- sic manner hi which Russell envisioned them is to read and study his books and papers, since, so many spin doctors have attempted to reinterpret and skew them according to their own ideas and pur- poses. Beyond what we have supplied as a feeble background for Russell (in this in- tentionally brief article), we will leave a few links and tell-tale quotes from Scully's book that stand as clues left by Scully regarding at least two of his sources: \"In 1945 Newton told Walter Russell that the. broadcasting of microwaves by his instrumentation never exceeded 32 miles.\" \"Instead of staying home overnight on the desert, we decided to drive back to town, a matter of only two hours and the eminent geophysicist stopped off at our house for a short visit to meet miss Scully and our family.\" I am Daryl Stangl, Assistant State Di- rector of Iowa MUFON. I have been a field investigator since about 1994, and have worked on landing trace cases, mu- tilation cases, sighting cases, and a num- ber of abduction cases. I was trained and certified as a hypnotherapist by Terry Garland and the National Guild of Hypnotists in 1996, and have worked with abductees ever since. I am one of the founders of Bridges— an International support and research group for experiencers founded in 1998. I also run a Midwest support system called the MARSS group (Midwest Abductee Research and Support System). My cases have put me in contact with such people as Nancy Talbott, Linda Howe, Budd Hopkins, and Barbara Bartholic (Rarla Turner's hypno-thera- pist). The case I am currently investigating involves a well respected professional in- dividual in his community who observed an alien type creature come out of his wife's apparently lifeless body about three and a half years ago at approxi- mately 2:30 a.m., look at him, and then walk through the wall. This person the next day told or wrote about 3-4 people about the experience, and then proceeded to forget about it until he attended the 2003 Ozark UFO Confer- ence, where he met a person who re- minded him of the experience. From that point, this professional has learned of the interwoven tapestry of how this creature has infiltrated his life. Now in my portion of the investigation of this case, I have encountered a number of people who have helped me to learn about a \"Reptilian hosting\" program, which would help to explain some of the experi- ences that this person is going through. Dr. Shakundali Modi, who has writ- ten two books, one of which is called Remarkable Healing, is one person who has shared research about this agenda. Barbara Bartholic, too, has studied this phenomenon for 30 years, and has shed much light on my research. However, I am still looking for others who might have information in regards to this case that might help me and the people involved. I would like to have the information written. I feel it would be one way of screening the serious answers from people who might just be flippant enough to send goofy emails without any serious intent.

Filer Director, MUFON Eastern Region George Filer Unless noted, these reports have not been verified by official investigations. Former Air Force Commander of Chile says he chased UFOs Gen. Hernan Gabrielli described his 1978 UFO encounter to Alejandro Guillier, stating: \"We were flying two F-5s, dual training craft, and we were returning to base from Mejillones to Antofagasta. \"I suddenly detected a radar fault and saw a line that ran side to side on the scope, and my stu- dent, Danilo Catalin, also detected the same, and curiously enough the ground radar, which has a large screen, also in- dicated a radar fault. At that time we looked toward [the part of the sky indicated on the radar screen] and we saw that UFO.' \"It was visualized as a smoke-covered, half-deformed banana, that was very large and in plain sight. It was tremendously large and surrounded by a fumarole, which moved in our same direction and at the same speed as our aircraft. \"We approached it carefully. We were heading back from Attack 1, which is a combat tactic involving gun cameras, no cannon, missiles or anything else. So we approached it with caution. The UFO did not go away, so we arrived in an instant at the same altitude, between 30,000 and 35,000. TheF-5 fighter covers 10 nauti- cal miles a minute (20 kilometers a minute).\" Guillier: And this object you saw, how fast did it vanish? Gen. Gabrielli: Unimaginable; in other words, thousands of nautical miles a minute, because it vanished toward the west suddenly and the screen cleared up. In other words, all three radar screens- trie ground radar, mine, and Danilo's- were operating normally. \"It wasn't just a visual experience, but a physical one as well, one that material- ized on the screen. I haven't the slightest idea where they come from. At that time there was also another sighting by a pi- lot near Calama, in a Vampire aircraft. \"Vampires were wooden aircraft, and the fighter climbed to a high altitude, but could see from below that the UFO didn't move. However, as the pilot climbed, he said, he could never reach it. They later sent out a pair of fighters, then an F-5, and nothing, really. They climbed to fifty something thousand feet, and had to turn back, but they never reached it.\" Guillier: \"And by the descriptions you recall, General, was there any similar- ity with the sighting you had in Antofagasta?\" Gen. Gabrielli: \"No, because this one had another shape-it had a shape...in other words, as though looking from be- low upward. The pilots flying at the time said it was triangular. This was 1978, and the latest thing around was the Mach 3, SR-71, U.S. spy plane. This thing did not move.\" Guillier: \"Now, why does the FACH [Chilean Air Force] handle all of this with such secrecy, because it has in fact ap- peared before Congress and before par- liamentarians, and everyone was deathly silent...there were no such things. All they do is create more concern, because one says: 'Well, there must be something aw- ful that the FACH, the senators, and the deputies don't want to discuss,' and in this case they were all quiet.\" Gen. Gabrielli: \"Look, it's not that there's an unwillingness to talk, but since it is an almost intangible piece of informa- tion, it cannot be handled, it cannot be processed.

The body of the craft had a very dim luminescent glow and a small flash- ing light at the left end. The craft was flattish, but with a cur- vature on top, like an upside down din- ner plate. It seemed to be flying near the Brooklyn and Williamsburg bridges. The disc was still there at 11:30 PM, near the JFK Airport. Personnel in the tower and planes should have seen it. The UFO had a flashing rear light and a white light in the top center moving in a circular motion on the crown. There was an orange-reddish color to it, and there was an upward tilt at the front of the craft. It changed shape as it flew back and forth, and had an elongated disk shape to it. Thanks to.

Mandy, a 21-year old, along with her mother, her sister, and one of her friends, saw a huge object off Route 32. Mandy reports that they observed \"a triangular-shaped formation of lights on one large object, with the lights flashing in sequence and simultaneously alternat- ing in color from pinkish-red, blue, white to yellow. There were 4 or 5 lights on the outer edges of the triangle facing down- ward that flashed as a row of lights. \"The flashing effect was vastly differ- ent than the twinkling of a star. The col- ors would change in unison, all red or all yellow, etc., and would flash along the outer edge of the object in a slow se- quence at first, then the flashing se- October 2003 quence escalated in speed after several minutes into the sighting. The UFO was not quite as big as a full moon, and it hovered above Belfast for almost an hour at an elevation less than 45 degrees above the horizon.\" Mandy's mother, who is skeptical about UFOs, decided to have Mandy re- port the object because it seemed to be so unusual.

I am a 40-year-old Mom, and I observed this with my 10-year-old daughter and my 14-year-old son while driving home \"More lights were shining to the west, and it almost looked like a radio tower with the red lights. As we got closer, I observed there was no tower under these lights.' It just hovered in one spot above the trees. The bottom of it looked round, but the front of it looked a little different, and that's where the red lights were. \"I woke up my son to observe this as well. This object was very large and re- minded me of the Star Trek Enterprise Spaceship without the tail (that's the best way I can describe it). We observed this for several minutes. It did not move at any time that we observed it. I wish we had pulled over to sit and watch it, but we were in such shock over seeing this incredible sight.\" Thanks to Peter Dav- enport NUFORC. Lighted object in New Jersey OLD BRIDGE - Sam Sherman writes: \"On Aug. 15, 2003, my wife and I were driving east on Cottrell Road at 8:43 PM, and just as we approached Route 34, my wife noticed an odd lighted object hov- ering over some frees. From the distance it looked like a football-shaped object, self illuminated fully (from within) by what looked like pure white light. MUFON UFO Journal . \"I decided to cross Route 34 and get closer to the object, which apparently was hovering in place. After driving around a few blocks to get a clear view without trees obstructing, I stopped the car and took my monocular from the car trunk. With the monocular, I got a clearer view of the object. \"It had a white strobing light on top and a similar light on the bottom. On the side of the object I saw some darkened pattern, but could not make out what it was. Seeing this pattern gave me the idea that it might have been an advertising blimp, not a true UFO, but there are con- cepts against that. '•• ' \"First, I could see no pilot's cabin or gondola on the bottom of the object, and the bottom white strobing light was right oh the bottom of the object not under such a gondola. Second, if it were an ad- vertising blimp the message (dark part) on the side was impossible to read clearly and would never have been noted by the unaided eye-what would be the purpose of such advertising? \"Third, if there were flashing lights on it to warn planes, it would seem that those should be red, not pure white. Fourth, the object as seen'appeared very similar to a recent British sighting. \"I have gone to the FAA website and downloaded the Official Regulations for AIRSHIPS (BLIMPS). They MUST have a RED and a GREEN LIGHT. They MUST have a light at the FORWARD END and a light at the REAR END. The object we sighted did not meet these regulations. \"My wife and I are leaning to the opin- ion that what we observed was a non- terrestrial craft of unknown origin. It may not have been a football shape, but a len- ticular (lens-shaped) object, such as a fly- ing disk-of which we only saw one side view, making it look from that side as foot- ball shaped.

The witness saw a really strange object and pointed it out to his friends. Due to the object being so low, they wondered if it was attached by a cable, wire, etc. because it sat stationary in one position. At that point, they grabbed a camera, got out of the vehicle, and took three snapshots of it. The UFO was cigar-shaped, solid gray in color, and sitting at 250 feet altitude. The witness said, \"While we stood watch- ing the object, it started to pulsate, then disappeared or blinked out.\" It was also very close, and they watched for about four minutes.

I would haz- ard a guess at 3000 to 4000 feet altitude. \"The object was white, but with a slightly wispy, almost translucent appear- ance which gave it a somewhat indistinct outline, hence my initial reaction that it was a feather. I could, however, just make out a definite structure, that was basically rectangular in overall plan form, and con- sisted of what might have been a lattice of booms, which gave it an appearance rather reminiscent of an old-fashioned TV aerial. \"Seen from a long distance, this would explain why it looked rather vague and wispy. It was moving asymmetrically, that is, set at a slight angle in relation to its direction of travel, which was from west to east. \"It had a steady and purposeful for- ward motion, and remained observable as a white speck receding into the distance for a short time after it had passed over- head. \"Another glider pilot, who that after- noon had landed in a field some 30 miles to the east of my position, reported that he and his retrieve crew had also seen the same object.

The story begins with a family who was camping at St. Marys Lake, which is located approximately 12 miles east of Kimberley, British Columbia, Canada. Around 12:45 a.m. the husband and wife decided to do some star gazing as the children were asleep, and the night was warm and the sky was clear and full of stars. As the couple stood looking into the night sky they observed a very bright, white light heading in a southeast- erly direction. The moon-sized light was witnessed flying low over Bootleg Mountain and across the lake. As it slowed, then picked up speed once again, the witnesses watched the light zig zag slightly, and at times seemed to wobble, moving out of sight. When they arrived back home from their camping trip they contacted the Kimberley Royal Canadian Mounted Po- lice (RCMP) detachment and spoke to a Cpl. Rod Carbonneau to inquire if others had reported seeing the object. Cpl. Carbonneau said the detachment had re- ceived no calls. The Cranbrook Airport was also con- tacted and asked if there were any air- craft in the area of the sighting, but none were reported in the vicinity where the object was observed. For the couple who had watched this amazing sight, not many answers were forthcoming. A couple of area residents did tele- phone the couple who watched the event, telling them what they also saw that night, and another did make a report to the local newspaper. A flood of calls A report was made to Peter Daven- port at the NUFORC in Seattle, Washing- ton, and then the sighting report was for- warded on to me here at HBCC UFO Re- search (Houston, British Columbia) for a follow-up investigation. What I did not realize at this time was just how large this one case was going to be. From a handful of witnesses, the case exploded into a major event where I cur- rently have 157 eyewitnesses to some- thing very mysterious. Two things happened.in the early morning hours that Sunday: a large moon sized object was seen by many area resi- dents, and a beam, or ray, of white light was observed from Kamloops to as far southeast as Jaffray, British Columbia. Those who watched the strange and puzzling event said the white light looked as bright as a florescent tube, and was arced from horizon to horizon as if one were viewing a rainbow. The beam of light sat almost station- ary in this position for approximately an hour before dissipating. Almost everyone who witnessed the beam of white light said they had never seen anything like this before. All said they have watched the northern lights many times, but they commented that this was certainly not the northern lights. Eyewitness accounts A gentleman from Cranbrook, B.C. telephoned me and reported that he and his family were sitting outside and were discussing how bad the forest fires are throughout the southern interior when one of the family members spotted what they thought was an airplane with its land- ing lights on heading in their direction. As the bright white light drew closer to them, the size was growing rapidly, and so was the brightness. Before they knew it, the light/object was upon them. The family was so frightened due to the immense size of the light/object al- most at the edge of their property that the children ran into the house screaming. The mother followed closely behind. The father followed his wife and kids into the home, but stopped to take one last glance at whatever it was, and watched it make a 90-degree turn to the south. When I spoke to the dad he told me that they heard not a sound coming from it. Another report came from a lady who was with a group of people on their holi- day at their cabin on one of the local Kimberley, B.C., lakes. She told me they were sitting outside on the deck when one of the guests pointed towards the northwest. Low over one of the moun- tains came a huge, extremely bright white light traveling slowly in a zig zag pattern heading to the southeast. As it got closer to the resort area, many people became uncomfortable due to how strange the object/light was act- ing. As it passed straight overhead not a sound was heard. Some of the folks who were there said it was like looking at a full moon on a clear night. It was that big. Two men in a pick-up truck traveling north along the highway just south of Wycliffe spotted the large bright object flying south. As they watched it close in on their location they pulled the truck over to the side of the highway and jumped out of the vehicle to get a better look. Due to it being so low, so bright, and passing directly over them, the light from the object lit up the highway and sur- rounding area. Both men stood frozen in their tracks and speechless. Both said it moved quickly in a straight line and made no unusual maneuvers. Again no sound was heard, which is remarkable consider- , ing how close it was to these men. One lady said that what she saw didn't behave like the northern lights, noting that the lights danced across the sky, or looked like a curtain of shimmering light. She initially wondered if the long, dry, hot weather might have something to do with what she was seeing, but her thoughts changed quickly as she watched the light come from the north- west horizon and impale itself on one of the local hills-and that is where it ended, according to this witness. Few answers There is no doubt that something very unusual took place on Sunday, July 28, 2003 in the wee hours that morning, and I have tried to come up with some rea- ' sonable answers. Here is what I know: 157 witnesses watched an amazing event unfold-3 lob- serving the object, and 126 the beam of October 2003 MUFON UFO Journal Page 15"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"light. Some observed both. The Interna- tional Space Station passed over Kimberley, B.C., at 00:24 hrs. on July 27, 2003. A fireball was observed fly ing in a southeasterly direction over the west coast of Canada and the U.S. Most of the witnesses reported the light/object and beam of light running from the northwest to the southeast. There would have been a lot of air traffic in some of these areas due to ef- forts to control the devastating forest fires which raged through some of these areas in the summer of 2003. This is certainly a mystery. After speaking with witnesses, looking at data on astronomical events, checking to see if there were aircraft in these areas at the time of the sighting, I have come up against a brick wall. I have not found any rational expla- nation for what people saw that night. Fireballs, for example, do not, as far as I know, make 90-degree turns to another direction. Also the object was low, trav- eling rather slowly, and not making a sound in many of the reports. Something else I found rather inter- esting, was the fact that reported sightings had dropped in my area here in the Pacific Northwest of British Colum- bia while reports of unusual crafts of ev- ery kind were now being reported by many people in the areas from Kamloops, the Okanagan, and straight through into the Kootenays. Did the more than 800 forest fires attract visitors from above? Missing time three days later two women had a missing time experience in Kelowna, Brit- ish Columbia, and the green lights seen on this night were witnessed by others at different locations, which backed up their incredible story. The story is real, but the names in this report are fictitious for obvious rea- sons. Pat-driver of the car. Linda-passenger and friend. Date: July 31,2003 (Thursday) Time: Between 1 AM & 2 AM On Aug. 18, 2003,1 received a tele- phone call from Pat, who lives in Kelowna, British.Columbia. The lady was very up- set and had a difficult time speaking of the event that took place with her and a close female friend, who was visiting her. She told me that a friend had brought over a* newspaper article which was run in the Kelowna Capital newspaper.. The headline read, \"Seeking Witnesses to UFO,\" which showed up on Aug. 15, 2003. 1 '- She reports that another couple who live in the area watched an aerial craft hovering close to the location where the two ladies had parked their car at the side of the highway, and gave confirmation to the incident, or at least witnessed an ob- ject. Around midnight on July 31,2003, the two ladies were playing on the computer when Linda mentioned that they had not done any star gazing in a long time, so Pat suggested that they go out and do it. They left home at 12:05 AM, heading out to an area where they would get a look at the clear night sky without having lights to interfere with their view. Pat drove to Glenmore, which is north from where she lives, and is on the back road heading to Winfield from Kelowna, B.C. They were driving along and Pat re- ported that there was quite a bit of traffic for that time of night, but after they de- cided to stop just off to the side of the road to look at the sky, the traffic stopped coming.   ; There was not a light from any ve- hicles, nor anything other than a very dark stretch of road. Pat grabbed her flashlight and shined it into the sky, as she has done in the past. Linda had the binoculars on the other side of the car scanning the starry night sky. They were there only a minute or so when Linda remarked that there were three stars in the sky formed into a triangle shape. All three lights at this time were solid white. Both ladies watched as the three white lights started moving, but moving together. Linda remarked that stars don't do that, and Pat agreed, thinking it might be a plane or something. Linda said it was not a plane, as the lights were changing color to a neon green, and the object stopped and hovered just ahead of their car. Pat turned the headlights off, and shone her flashlight down the road in front of her car. They were worrying about ani- mals such as a bear, cougars, etc. being in this isolated area. As she shined the light up the road, both women spotted something which . frightened them. Five sets of eyes about 40 feet away were staring at them. As frightened as they were, their first thoughts were of coyotes or some other wild ani- mal. But it quickly became obvious that these eyes did not belong to animals. Pat describes the creatures as being roughly four feet tall', dark gray shoulders, and coming towards the women, explaining, \"I was so scared I could hardly talk and could hardly breathe.\" She yelled to her friend Linda, \"Get in the car, get in the car.\" Pat said they both scrambled to get back into the vehicle, but she said it was like moving through quicksand, and it felt horrible being so terrified and trying to move as fast as they possibly, could, but feeling as if ev- erything was slowing down around them. Once they were both back in the car, Pat tried to turn the ignition on so she .could get the power windows up, but all the electrics on the car were failing. The dome light and headlights were going off and on, and, as she said, \"Ev- erything was going nuts!\" Finally the car started, and they turned around in the middle of the road and raced off towards home, noticing a fair amount of traffic coming in their direc- tion. (Pat commented to me, \"Where was all the traffic when all this was happen- ing?\") As they drove along the road, Pat said to Linda, \"This is the weirdest thing. My whole body is tingling-just like I was zapped by a charge from a battery.\" When Linda heard this, she said, \"I didn't want to say anything to^you, as you might think I was nuts, but I am feel- ing the same, as if I was hit by an electri- cal charge.\" As Linda was explaining how she felt, she glanced at the clock in the car and said, \"Jesus, Pat, look at the time.\" Pat asked what she was talking about, and Linda reminded her that they had been out of their car for a few minutes at the most, and the time of the car's clock indi- cated an extra 25 minutes of time. As they were just about home, they turned onto Baker Street, which is cov- ered in darkness next to a field. Suddenly they saw a bright, glowing neon green ball low in the sky. The object started moving to the right, then stopping, to the right, then stop- ping, and then starting to move away, but stopping when the ladies'car came to a halt. Before they knew it, the ball of green light started heading towards them at a high rate of speed, stopping and hover- ing high above their car. At this point the ladies just wanted to get to their home and be as far away from whatever it was as possible. The driver sped off quickly again, and they headed into an orchard which was very close by. They thought they would not be seen hiding amongst the trees, and there was no lighting in this area to reveal their po- sition. Pat looked at her friend and said, \"They will never find us here. Both women were trying to get them- . selves together, but Pat said she was los- ing it at this point. A very short time after arriving in the orchard Linda said, \"Pat, you better look out the front windscreen and look up slightly. We don't have just Page 16 MUFON UFO Journal October 2003"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"one green ball of light.\" There were now three glowing green objects in the sky, forming a triangle and moving together. After a short time each of the green lights moved away in different directions. The witnesses told me that each light was about half the size of a full moon. After seeing the lights flying off into different directions, the ladies raced home. Once safe at home, both were shaken, trying to come up with some ex- planation for what had just happened. Later, both turned in for the night, and when they woke up in the morning, Pat discovered a large bruise on her left breast and another on the bottom of her foot. She did not know how they got there, but she did know they were ex- tremely painful. As she sat drinking a cup of coffee, Linda finally got up and was walking down the hall towards the kitchen when she said, \"God, do I feel rough this morn- ing.\" As Linda finished saying that, Pat watched blood suddenly pour from Linda's nose. Linda also complained that she was having a lot of pain in her lower back area. Pat looked and gasped-there was a large circle burned into her skin in the tail bone area. Also, bruises were found on Linda's body as well, some of them looking like finger marks-three of them on each thigh. Linda, who was up visiting from the Abbotsford, ended her holiday and headed back home. Two days after being home she went to consult her family doc- tor, still experiencing the terrible pain which was originating from her lower back. Her doctor said, \"If I didn't know any better I would say you have a. radiation burn,\" referring to the burn mark on Linda's back. The doctor is still trying to heal this mark on her back, as something had burned right through the outer layer of her skin. (HBCC UFO Note: I will be keeping in contact with the witness to this event and hope I may be able to help in some small way). On the night this frightening experi- ence took place, another couple who couldn't sleep decided to go out for a walk on the warm evening. They looked up at times into the night sky, and all of a sudden they noticed a bright glowing neon colored light. The couple reported that the light was moving in a strange way, coming to a complete stop, moving again, stopping, and then moving off very quickly. The light was seen in the same vicin- ity where Pat and Linda had been stopped at the side of the road. The crop circle m Locusi Grove/Serpent Mound, OH. Crop circles keep investigator busy By Roger Sugden Assist. State Director Indiana MUFON I have recently been to eight crop circles in the past two months. Follow- ing is a summary. Mayville, WI I got a call from Jeffrey Wilson in mid- July, 2003, telling me there was a crop circle in Wisconsin which occurred July 4,2003. After hearing there was an eye- witness, 1 was anxious to participate in the investigation. As far as we know, this is the only eyewitness to a crop circle formation in the United States. This was in Mayville, WI, where we went on July 23 and were met by Dr. Charles Lietzau, science consultant for MUFON, who also is helping with the investigations and research of the crop circles. We were fortunate to have assistance by a local resident, who helped us find our way to the crop circle, which was in wheat. Our preliminary findings, which included expulsion cavities, or blown nodes, in the wheat, have led us to say that this was a genuine crop circle. More tests are currently being run on samples taken from the circle, and more information can be found on the internet at cropcirclenews.com. Wilson, Dr. Lietzau, and I interviewed the eyewitness, a retired semi-driver, and found him to be very credible. He was up on a hill on July 4,2003, looking out of his window from his workshop at about 7:40 AM when he noticed the wind pick up, blowing the trees different directions and ripping bark off a tree next to his work- shop. As he looked in the direction of the wheat field, he observed what looked like black holes opening up in the field. After the wind died down, he went to see what it was, and there were three circles in the wheat. I made arrangements to rent a plane at a local airport and photographed it from the air. When I returned from the airport, I noticed a military Huey helicopter fly- ing toward the crop circle, then making several passes over the crop circle. We later identified it as a National Guard heli- copter. Howe, MI Jeffrey Wilson informed me of a crop circle in Howe, MI, not far from where he lives. He, Dr. Lietzau, and I investigated the site and found that there were two circles, a large one and a smaller one, in wheat. I took aerial photographs of the formations. Wilson and I were taking samples when he lifted up the crop from one of the circles and, unknown to us, there were smaller, swirled circles under- neath. As it turned out, there were four small, swirled circles underneath each circle at each compass point, which was unusual Also, there were two paths op- (Continued on Page 19) October 2003 MUFON UFO Journal Page 17"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"PERCEPTIONS By Stanton T. Friedman TV and UFOs When Dr. Herbert Strentz published his PhD thesis \"A Survey of Press Cov-. erage of Unidentified Flying Objects, 1947-1966\" in 1970 at Northwestern Uni- versity, he focused on the inadequacy of the print media, noting, for example, that \"The coverage has been marked by su- perficiality, redun- dancy, silliness, careless reporting and lack of rel- evant informa- tion.\" At that time most people didn't have cable TV, and usually only had access to the three major networks and perhaps NPR S(an , on Friedman and a local sta- tion. Now with almost everybody having access to a host of additional channels and several specialized networks besides the big three, TV has become the major supplier of news and entertainment. Broadcasters finally came to realize that the public was very interested in UFOs, and would watch almost anything on the subject-no matter the quality or accuracy. In addition, as with today's reality pro- gramming, TV shows about UFOs can be very cheap to produce. Very rarely are participants paid, so that it is just travel and production costs. Sometimes the programs are quite ac- curate and fair. Sometimes they are ter- rible. I received many emails complaining about the Sci-Fi Channel's broadcast of \"The Belzer Report\" on Sept. 9, 2003. It was made early in 2002. Karl Pflock and I were both flown to New York, and were supposed to debate about Roswell. A production crew had gone to Roswell and the debate was to be moderated by Belzer with a panel of experts chiming in. I had sent lots of materials and re- sponded to many phoned questions. I made a particular point of providing cop- ies of front page headline stories about the incident from evening papers on July 8, 1947, including the Chicago Daily . News, The Los Angeles Herald Express, The Spokane Chronicle, The Sacra- mento Bee, etc, to demonstrate that it was a major national story, not just a big deal in the small town of Roswell. Nothing went right. I arrived at the air- port to get my ticket and found that it hadn't been paid for, so I had to plunk down my credit card. The people who were picking me up in NY were at the wrong terminal. I then found out that the panel, while it included Jim Marrs, who knows a lot about UFOs, included a couple of come- dians, Al Franken and Janine Gerafalo of Saturday Night Live fame, as well as Ice- T who (with Belzer) is on Law and Order. We met with Belzer and other crew members before filming and had a good discussion. The set arrangement was quite peculiar, with Karl and me standing next to a small table and the panel sitting some distance away-and with Belzer in between, sometimes blocking our view of the panelists. What was supposed to be a serious discussion almost immediately deterio- rated into a quest for laughs by Janine and Franken. They had supposedly been provided with lots of material, but appar- ently considered it beneath them to do any homework. Go for laughs. Franken made an ass out of himself by asking why I hadn't trimmed my eyebrows!! He focused on the Roswell Daily Record July 8 article, and proclaimed that obviously, if it had been a major event, it would have appeared all over the coun- try. Of course it had, and the clippings were there. Both Karl and I and a few others who were there, including Linda Howe and Jim Marrs, thought it was a terrible produc- tion, and hoped it would never run. Sci-Fi held it for well over a year, but then de- cided at a high level that they needed to get a return on their investment, and ran it with lots of hype-and no advance warn- ing to Karl or myself. This experience reminded me that most people are unaware of how TV really works. Here are a few examples. I appeared on NIGHTLINE with Ted Koppel on June 24,1987, to debate with Phil Klass, being in Washington, DC, to present a paper at the MUFON Confer- ence at that time. The focus of the debate was supposed to be the Government cover-up of UFO information. Once at the station, Klass and I were told that we could not bring anything into the studio. I had along the 80% blacked out NSA affidavit justifying withholding 156 of their UFO documents even from the judge. I argued, but lost; nothing could be brought in, though the document cer- tainly establishes a coverup, since the 80% could certainly not be just sources and methods data. Then Klass and I were each told not to look at each other, although we were sitting two feet apart with a small table between us. Each was to look only at his camera. Not easy arguing with somebody so close and not being able to look at each other for all those nonverbal com- munications that are so important. I have no idea where Koppel was, since I could only hear him through a poor earplug, and there was no monitor to look at. The next day people at the MUFON conference asked how things went. \"I don't know.\" \"What do you mean you don't know; you were there.\" \" Yes, but I have no idea what you saw. A tight shot? A far shot? Klass or Koppel reacting to what I said, or Koppel and.I reacting to what Klass said? Was I fidgeting or show- ing other nervous signs?\" I was asked what Koppel was like. I had to say I had no idea, never saw his face. To say the least, it was awkward and also frustrating not being able to show the documents. When I appeared on the Larry King show across from the L'il Alien Inn in tiny Rachel, NV, in the middle of nowhere in 1994, there were two interesting aspects. In the afternoon I asked one of the producers how they would handle phone calls. \"Oh, they are received in Atlanta and then transmitted via satellite to a huge production truck the viewing audience will not see,\" she said. \"We will monitor calls very carefully, because most people don't believe in UFOs.\" I pointed out that the statement was totally false and rattled off some facts from various polls to prove it was wrong. Unfortunately, the damage from this false belief had already been done by shaping who would be asked to provide the various small snippets from Carl Sagan, William Shatner (a real astronaut, of course) etc. Obviously the contribu- Page 18 MUFON UFO Journal October 2003"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"tors were skewed towards the negative, based on the false presumption that that is where the public stood. The show had another aspect. I was asked by a number of people, \"How come you didn't talk about Topic A, or Topic B, or Topic C?\" I had to point out that none of the live panelists, Kevin Randle, Steve Greer,. Glenn Campbell, and myself, had any idea of what was going on. Larry heard over his ear plug when a commercial was due, or a caller was on the line, or a snippet. We didn't. He was in complete control. The only time we got is what we grabbed. Many shows are produced in a way in which each interviewee is talked to sepa- rately and then shown on a program with a number of others. People think we were all together, and sometimes think in terms of guilt by association. I am in at least one show in which Bob Lazar is also interviewed as though he were a scientist, as opposed to a total fraud as described on my website (www.v- j-enterprises.com/sfpage.html) and in TOP SECRET/ MAJIC. We have never met, though we had one telephone conversa- tion. The worst example that comes to mind is a UPN show about a supposed abduc- tion in Minnesota, with the abducted fam- ily supposedly making a video of the ex- perience and the video being found, but not the family. Great story? No; totally a \"creative production.\" I had been called to see if I could come to LA to answer a bunch of questions about abductions for a production being done very soon for Dick Clark Produc- tions. I would get a chance to see my daughter, and the questions should be interesting. I went, was asked very sen- sible questions on film, and did see my daughter. I was never asked about nor shown the abduction video. The people must have liked what I said because they used my comments interspersed throughout the show and even in the advertising. The editing was very creative between what was happening and my comment. An EM effect occurred and they had me talking about EM effects. In a quick pass at the end of the show, which appar- ently left half of the people thinking this was a true story, they listed cast mem- bers who played Alien 1, Alien 2, etc. It was a terrible home video produc- tion. I was lambasted via email and calls for being in it. Kevin Randle said that I should have known better than to be in- volved with a show directed by Bob Kiviat, who did the Alien Autopsy. Kiviat had nothing to do with the show. Nobody complained about anything I October 2003 said. I got so fed up with off-the-wall criticism (If you can't trust Dick Clark, who can you trust?) that 1 went on the Art Bell show to explain. Many producers don't care about the truth and will say anything to get good people on board. Sometimes they can be trusted, such as with the Unsolved Mys- teries Program about Roswell, which I had instigated. Other times, as with Belzer Pre- sents, there was substantial misrepresen- tation. If Karl and I had been told that the idea was not sensible discussion with a knowledgeable panel, but Saturday Night Live Comic routines, we would not have gone on. Stan Friedman fsphvs@rogers.com . Crop circle investigations reported... (Continued from Page 17) posite each other on the larger circle. We determined through preliminary findings that it was genuine. Keekoskee, WI We got a call later from a local resident in Hdricon, WI, that there was something in the wheat that looked like a crop circle. Wilson and I returned to Wisconsin to investigate this, which was in Keekoskee, WI. We located the formation in a wheat field, and determined it was a hoax. Ontario, Canada The next crop circle we heard about was in Ontario, Canada. Since it was just across from Sarnia, MI, Wilson and I de- cided to have a look at it on Aug. 2. The crop circle was formed around July 24. We met with the farmer who owned the land, which was just across from his driveway in a wheat field. It had been found while they were combining the wheat; however, he had left the crop around the formation, which was a picto- gram. The CCCRN had also been there to take a look, and Joann Emery, of CCCRN, had told us she had found some expul- sion cavities. We also found some. The formation was similar to one in England, on an east-west axis. We could not take soil or plant samples or take any radiation readings, as we did not want to take radiation counters over the border into Canada. This formation also was determined to be genuine through our preliminary testing. A local pilot also was kind enough to fly me over the site for aerial photographs. Interestingly, there were thousands of people who went to visit this site. Klyman, WI Wilson and I returned to Wisconsin to investigate several reports of multiple crop circles. We searched the surround- ing areas where there had been reports, but we did not find anything significant. We decided to drive south to visit a friend we met in Wisconsin, and about 10 miles south of Mayville, Jeffrey looked out of the vehicle and spotted what appeared to be a large crop circle in wheat in a field in Klyman, WI. MUFON UFO Journal We then found the landowner and got permission to go into the field to investi- gate this further. What we thought-was one large crop circle turned out to be a very large pictogram with seven circles and multiple pathways. We immediately called out local con- tacts, as this was a large formation, and we needed all the help we could get to obtain samples. As we finished sampling, the combine was cutting the field. The crop circle had been formed some- time around July 4, as far as we could find out, and this was also determined to be a genuine formation from preliminary find- ings. Mayfield, WI The sixth crop circle was brought to our attention by a local Mayville, WI, resi- dent, who told us there was a formation in corn, which I was anxious to see, since formations in corn are more rare. After considerable inspection, the mechanical damage was evident, and we all agreed that this wasa hoax. Locust Grove/Serpent Mound, OH The next crop circle was in soybeans in Locust Grove/Serpent Mound in southern Ohio. It was found Aug. 24, 2003, by a local resident who contacted Wilson through e-mail. With the help of many others, includ- ing Ted Robertson of Indiana, the Knoechelman's of Ohio, and some other local residents, we investigated the site. I took aerial photographs. Through pre- liminary investigation, this has been de- termined to be genuine. Adams County, OH The last formation investigated was brought to our attention by a local resi- dent of Adams County, OH, again in soy- beans. This was determined to have been made around Sept. 6,2003. After taking aerial photographs and inspecting the site, which was in the shape of a peace sign, or Mercedes hood ornament, it was determined that this was, in fact, a hoax. Samples are still pending final results, but current information can be found at cropcirclehews.com and earthfiles.com. Follow-up articles on the crop circles are planned. Page 19"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"By Jenny Randies Bedroom visitors -• The case was an interesting one. It occurred in the Pennine hills, scene of so much strange activ- ity. But what was seen by the young witness was in many respects fairly straightfor- ward. A small, lithe entity in an all over jump suit possess- ing slight angular features, and yet human appearance, Jenny Randies had appeared in- side the house and was watched as it moved from the bedroom down the stairs and out towards the yard. Although no UFO was seen by the witness, there were reports of one from other people in the neighborhood-which is not too surprising, as they are a com- mon occurrence in this area. We never got to the bottom of this sighting in the sense that there was no obvious cause for misidentification, and by all accounts the witness was sincere. However, it stands out to me because it is one of many similar cases that I have in- vestigated that demonstrate the shadowy boundaries that exist between close en- counters. Night visions Two things make this case especially interesting to me. Firstly, its precise loca- tion. This was not a sighting of aliens alongside a spaceship. Rather, the entity was seen inside the bedroom. Secondly, the witness experiencing this was very clearly in some kind of al- tered state of consciousness. She was woken from sleep by the experience, and so was at best not fully awake. This in- troduces all sorts of possibilities as to what might really have been going on during the undoubtedly genuine encoun- ter. This otherwise mundane CE 3 (Close Encounter of the third kind) is what I re- fer to as a bedroom visitor. And the UFO literature is full of them. I have personally investigated dozens with features that are much like this particular example. How- ever, there is an intriguing question that occurs about such night visions made within one's home. How do we determine whether the in- cident should properly be regarded as an alien contact? Might it not have more in common with other paranormal phenom- ena? After all, who decides that the fig- ure seen really was an alien if it is other- wise human in appearance and did not walk into a UFO which promptly flew off into the sky? It would take relatively little to make this case into something other than a CE 3. For instance, what if the being was not dressed much like an entity often seen associated with UFOs? Say that it simply disappeared, or walked into the dresser or through a wall? What if it offered some words of personal advice and comfort to the witness? Would they then choose to interpret the encounter as a meeting with a ghost, or an angel, or a guiding spirit? Boundaries The problem is that we (both the wit- ness and the investigator) place bound- aries around the type of event that we would be interested in following up. We mould and shape the evidence without actually realising what we are about. If a case has certain features, then we may regard it as \"one of ours\" and seek the evidence that we believe must lurk behind its innocent facade. If it lacks these features, then we might well be tempted to pass it on to someone else-a parapsychologist or angel inves- tigator-because they deal with such cases, and it has no relevance to UFOs. The trouble with that is that we are making a selective judgement. For how do we know where to draw up these boundaries that encase these events? There may in truth not be any walls be- tween various types of bedroom visitor experience. Indeed, the hundreds of cases that I have collected for a study of such reports (including quite a few that I have person- ally investigated even when few would have ever treated them as UFO-related) do share much more than you would imag- ine. Indeed, the similarities outweigh the differences, in my opinion. A broader view Unfortunately, as fields such as UFO study have progressed, we have tended to become more narrowly focused. For some time the .study of entity cases has effectively been subsumed into abduc- tion research. It is rare to come upon well docu- mented CE3s now, as opposed to aspects of more complex abductions (CE 4s)-al- though many classic abductions feature nearly all the elements of a bedroom visi- tor episode as some key part of their storyline. Although specialization may in some respects offer advantages, and has shown us fascinating new perspectives about UFOs, there are real dangers as well. If we fail to study large parts of the evidence because we decide that such cases are not relevant to what we per- ceive to be the UFO mystery, then do we not run the risk of making dubious judge- ments and building hypotheses out of fragments of the evidence, rather than the whole picture? The concept of bedroom visitors- where entities that can be (and often are) interpreted in a variety of non-alien con- texts by those who see and study them, is of great interest in its own right. But in many ways it demonstrates something more fundamental about UFOlogy that we maybe ought to re-evaluate. We chose what the limits of our sub- ject are, but in doing so are we defining the evidence or transforming its nature into an image that we want it to possess?

Reviewed by Dwight Connelly The Journal of UFO Studies is con- sistently the best series of f  -~~ scientifically- i JOURNAL OF UFO based ufolog- ' STUDIES ical publications in the world, and this latest vol- ume is an out- standing addi- tion, providing reliable informa- tion that is avail- able nowhere else. In the first presentation, analytical scientist Phyllis Budinger of Frontier Analysis, Ltd., adds significantly to the soil analysis of the Delphos, KS, landing case of 1971. Ably investigated and sampled more than 30 years ago by Ted Phillips, the top traces investigator in the world, the fa- mous glowing ring and surrounding soil has been analysed over the years, most notably by organic chemist Erol Faruk, who provided significant insights regard- ing the residues left by the hovering ob- ject. A special monograph, Delphos: A Close Encounter of the Second Kind, was published by the UFO Coalition last year (see August, 2002, Journal for a review) which included analyses by several labs, suggesting that the residues were indeed anomalous. Mrs. Budinger, using more modern equipment and the expertise of an ana- lytical chemist on the preserved samples, has significantly advanced this research. While not contradicting Faruk's initial observations, she adds significant data in her 25-page presentation, including several tables and graphs. [Mrs. Budinger will present a summary of her investigation of this case in the Novem- ber Journal.} The second presentation in this vol- ume is Richard Haines' \"Analysis of Pho- tograph of a High-speed Ball of Light,\" in which he investigates a color photograph reportedly taken by a pilot in 1956, utiliz- ing photo analysis, the study of aircraft windows, analysis of camera/lens/film, (Continued on Page 22) October 2003 MUFON UFO Journal Page 21"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"Journal of UFO Studies... (Continued from Page 21) and evaluation of witness credibility. His presentation covers 21 pages, and includes photos, diagrams, and charts. The third presentation is by Austra- lian researcher Keith Basterfield, who looks at \"The Implant Motif in UFO Ab- duction Literature,\" covering 84 such ac- counts. He reviews the comments of UFO re- searchers, and attempts to analyse what he terms \"the limited data available.\" This is the best overall study of the implant phenomenon that, has been done, as Basterfield reviews the first three re- ported cases in 1979, describes what ap- pears to be the first laboratory analysis (in 1990-91), and moves into the period of 1992-94, which he describes as \"implants everywhere.\" The 1995-99 period features implants recovered. The presentation includes charts which statistically analyse implants, such as by gender, by time period, by country, and by location in the body. In addition, Basterfield briefly describes 84 separate implant cases in this fascinating 34-page presentation. The fourth presentation is by Dr. Tho- mas E. Bullard of the Life Sciences Library at Indiana University, who discusses \"False Memories and UFO Abductions.\" Bullard, who has completed extensive studies of the abduction phenomenon, discusses whether abduction accounts can be the result of false memories. His 76-page presentation delves into such areas as recovered memories of child sexual abuse and satanic ritual abuse, psychological abnormalities, consistency of witness reports, and sequence of re- ported events. He concludes that there are specific elements of the abduction experience which suggest that it is sepa- rate from false memories. The final section of this impressive volume features book reviews by Alex Wendt and Richard Hall. This 2003 addition to the series is an excellent volume by a. distinguished group of researchers, and should be a part of every serious ufologist's library.

Schuessler MUFON International Director MUFON's Vision and Mission The MUFON Board of Directors has defined MUFON's vision as follows: \"To bring about scientific breakthroughs that .will forever change our planet and its people'for the better, by understanding the UFO mystery.\" To support that vi- sion, the mission of MUFON is defined as \"The scientific study ofUFOs for the benefit of man- kind.\" After decades of UFO investiga- tions, research, and rhetoric, a wealth of documentation has been amassed by individuals, groups and governments. Nevertheless, the mystery has not been solved. Therefore, MUFON continued to build its cadre of Field Investigators, Research Specialists and Consultants in order to seek truth and knowledge through more thorough research and investigations. In order to educate the public and help so- ciety MUFON has undertaken a number of initiatives to collect and disseminate information. The focus of the annual sym- posiums will be on documentation of a broad range of evidence. The pages of the MUFON UFO Jour- nal will continue to contain information about worldwide UFO reports, research done on a variety of topics, and up-to- date organizational information. The MUFON Pandora Project is aimed at translating thousands of pages of archived materials into electronic files that can be used by future researchers, writ- ers, and the public. A long-range goal is to provide electronic access to 35 years of issues of the MUFON UFO Journal and the past 33 issues of the annual MUFON International UFO Symposium Proceedings. Reports coming to the World UFO Database (WUFOD) on the MUFON web site at www.mufon.com are summarized weekly in a series of statistical reports that give a clear picture of what is being reported to MUFON. MUFON documen- tation is already available for sale to mem- bers and the public as a part of our public education effort. The MUFON Field Investigator 's Manual is in the process of being up- dated and enlarged to better support fu- ture investigations. We plan to support all of these initiatives with a continually upgraded web site. While we cannot control the motives and machinations of some individuals in this field, MUFON strives for high integ- rity and excellence in all we do. We see our job as the systematic collection and analysis of UFO data, with the ultimate goal of learning the origin and nature of the UFO phenomena. Out intention is to share the results of that work in a profes- sional manner in every way possible. Accordingly, MUFON does not sup- port ad hominem attacks on individuals, denigrating the character of anyone, or the falsification of UFO information for any reason. Our focus is on the eventual solution of the UFO mystery no matter what direc- tion that solution takes, and I believe this will contain sonic really big surprises along the way.
