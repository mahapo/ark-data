Research T here are plenty of sighting reports of unidenti- fied flying objects, but very few reports of sounds associated with these sightings. This has been the major focus of my research as an indepen- dent investigator over the past few years. My observa- tion that aerial and audio phenomena can be linked together is based on the fact that I was a direct eye and ear witness to the combined phenomena back in the mid 1970's. It was that experience that started my research and it is due to the greater cooperation and interest available in this field that I have pursued this further. I lived in a small, rural town called Orton, in Southern Ontario back then. It was part of an area that experienced a \"flap\" of UFO sightings. My husband at that time had given me a daily journal for Christmas, so I happen to have the events and dates recorded. Starting on March 3, 1975, my neighbours and I began to witness aerial phenomena: brilliant white, red, and green lights would do impossible acrobatic manoeuvres in the night sky, darting about in angular or triangular movements. Sometimes they would band together into one bright light, only to blink out, reap- pear and split again into several more bright lights. One of the more spectacular displays looked like The Star of Bethlehem one night. The rays from this \"star\" took up a good 60 degrees of the horizon, and there was this tiny red light that kept darting in and out of it. My girlfriend Julie and I watched this display for a good two hours. I noted,in my journal we both experi- enced headaches that night afterwards. The sightings always seemed predictable, at least by me; I always seemed to be aware of when they would appear. On the evening of April 26, 1975, I heard a strange, loud, metallic beeping sound coming from the woods behind our home. It sounded mechan- ical, like the pings of submarine sonar, and it had a peculiar rotational quality to it, like a Doppler effect. I even wondered if someone was out in the woods with some type of broadcasting equipment; the sound didn't seem natural and it was too loud to be anything else. You could hear this sound from a quarter mile away and even from inside the house with the doors and windows closed. Upon walking down to the woods to investigate this sound, I noticed my cats had beaten me down there and were sitting on fenceposts facing the sound and listening attentively. I decided to tell my neigh- bours about it. I heard later they were making fun of me; not only was I seeing strange lights in the sky, but now I was hearing strange sounds in the woods. Several weeks later, on the evening of May 19, 1975, my neighbours and I had been sitting around a bonfire in front of our large garden. There was a rest- less excitement in the air: you could feel. Even the animals were reacting to it. At 10:30 p.m. the roosters were crowing, the chickens clucking, and you could hear dogs barking and the pastured cows bawling for miles. I even remember remarking that Orton sounded like the introduction to an old TV series I watched as a child called \"Rawhide,\" starring Clint Eastwood. The program starts off in the middle of a cattle drive. It was that noticeable. We soon ended our conversation and went back to our homes. A couple of hours later, while taking the day's garbage out, I noticed these loud, peculiar beep- ing sounds again and I decided to get my neighbours over to investigate. I called Bob and Lynn Adams from across the street and Cal Stodts, a paramedic who lived next to me. Standing there, we could see red lights in behind the trees while we faced the beep- ing sounds. A ll of a sudden, the beeps stopped and everything got deathly quiet. Just as I pointed to the woods, a bright light rose out of the trees from the brush at the rear of our property and made a right-angle 90 degree turn, and started slowly to approach us in a wide arc. I ran behind a shed to get a better look at it, as our shad- ows were being cast over the yard by our back door spotlights, causing a glare. I could see that it was sil- ver and disc-shaped with a soft white dome on top of it. It appeared to be larger than a long van, approxi- mately 20 to 25 feet in length and maybe 8 to 10 feet wide in the middle. It was very low, not more than 100 feet up, and was coming in over my neighbours' pine tree, about 150 feet from where I was standing. When I could count the several red lights moving about its perimeter counterclockwise, I started to become alarmed, thinking this thing was going to land in my back yard! I ran back to my neighbours who were just as alarmed as I was. We were ready to take shelter, when the craft shifted its flight path and passed slowly off to the east. We were all shaken, but I was exhila- rated too. I noticed my knees felt weak. OTHER LOCAL SIGHTINGS The UFO sightings persisted, along with the beeping sounds, but not necessarily together.

One night, Harry Walker, who lived around the comer from us, had been putting his tractor in his drive shed when a disc-shaped object hovered over him beneath a low cloud ceiling. He hollered for his family to come outside and look at it, but his cries went unheard. His son Patrick came running down to tell me what his Dad had just seen and that he was \"white as a ghost.\" I immediately went down to interview him and was slightly relieved that another resident had seen some- thing similiar to the rest of us. I also talked with Jim Overland, a teenager back then who lived about a half mile from us on the same county road. He claims to have been out ploughing his field one day when a small, silver disc-shaped object came over him and his tractor. I believe he said that it chased him and that he ran into the house. Recently I was sent a clipping from the Letters to the Editor of the Toronto Star from a fellow who lived near me during those years. He requested that \"per- haps someone else residing in Orton could share their experiences with me.\" I have since talked to this fel- low and heard another story of a spectacular close encounter that he and his brother had 18 or 19 years ago. They had a boomerang-shaped craft hover motionless above them. They also saw the \"light shows\" along with their neighbours and-described the aerial phenomena exactly as I remember it. This fel- low plans to go back and interview our old neigh- bours. There will be more to this story as time goes along. The editor of our local newspaper, Bill Doole, had wanted to print my story for some time. I was reluc- tant to let him write up a story for The Erin Advocate because of the ridicule I was getting from the neigh- bours who hadn't seen anything. Finally, a year later, he ran a story on our sightings and was surprised by the number of calls he got from other local residents who had seen various types of craft flying around. Several described these UFOs as shining pencil-thin beams of light on to the ground. These articles caused some alarm and other articles were written trying to \"explain it all away.\" Talking recently with our old post mistress, Evelyn Nevilles, I learned that some of the village people still talk about the old sightings. THE INVESTIGATION I felt these unusual sightings should be documented so I contacted and met with J. Allen Hynek (then the Director of the Center for UFO Studies) and Henry McKay, who was then the MUFON Director of Canada. I invited Chris Purton, then a Professor of Astronomy at York University in Toronto to come over and record the sounds, as he lived not far away PAGE 4 NUMBER 318 OCTOBER 1994"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL The sound also appeared to have a biolog- ical response to your actions.

The opportunity came the evening of June 14, 1975. The beeping sounds were loud and constant. At first, his tape recorder refused to work. Thinking per- haps we were in some type of electromagnetic field that might be affecting the batteries of his recorder, we moved further away from the source of the sound and were able to obtain a two-minute recording. This tape was the catalyst for me to start researching the audio phenomenon and has since proved invaluable to me. Others came out to investigate the sounds and the sights, bringing along with them parabolic micro- phones and infrared cameras. Biologists were called in to try to explain the beeps as a bird call, all to no avail. Through the following year, the sightings continued on an irregular basis and so did the sounds. I was fas- cinated and would notice my heart start to race when- ever I heard the now familiar metallic sounds. I found I could approach the source of the sound. Having had by that time acquired aerial maps of my location, I was able to gauge how far away from me the sound was. I figured that I could get as close as 50 feet, then the sound would stop and instantaneously be in a loca- tion about 200 ft. away. The sound also appeared to have a biological response to your actions. If you approached the source of the sound slowly and talking quietly, the beeps would be low and steady. If, on the other hand, you were loud, excited and moving quickly, the beeps would get louder and faster in direct relation to your excitement. When I wonder about this many years later, I feel the sound was similiar to a biofeedback machine, which I certainly didn't know about then. One night while investigating the sound with friends, Pat Walker claimed he couldn't hear the beeps at a distance of about 200 feet because he thought the batteries in his hearing aid weren't working. Directly in front of this \"wall\" of sound, which was about 50 ft. from us, he claimed he still couldn't hear it, but that he could feel it in his chest. I thought this was a good observation as I had noticed on other occasions that the beeping sound seemed to penetrate the center of my chest as well. My friends then encouraged me to whistle the pitch of the beeps and after some prod- ding I decided to try. Immediately upon whistling the same pitch, we were astonished to experience the beeping sounds speed up and turn into a vibration that shook the ground we were standing on! I tried this several times with the same results until we were all huddled together in amazement and ready to get back to civilization. It was just too much to take. I noticed a compass spun rapidly in my hand when I got back to the house after this event. There were other unusual events happening at that time as well. I saw or- ange, gaseous balls of light in our backyard, drifting slowly along the ground. There was one occasion I re- member of long, gossamer threads of spider webs about 30 ft. long flowing through the town of Orton. Since then, I have read about the \"angel hair\" seen in con- junction with some UFO sightings. After a while, living in Orton began to resemble something out of the \"Twilight Zone.\" THE SEARCH I moved out of the area in 1977 and didn't encounter the phenomena for another 10 years. A series of events led me back into my search for answers. On a return trip to Canada in 1989,1 met with Henry McKay in his home in Toronto, as he said he had a couple of tape recordings of UFO-related beeping sounds that might be similiar to mine. I was very excited when I heard them, as they were the same as the ones I had recorded in my own backyard. I was relieved I wasn't \"alone\" in my experi- ences; someone else was reporting and recording the same phenomena in other locations! The tapes Henry presented to me were from a flap of UFO sightings and audio phenomena that happened in Alberta and British Columbia in the late I960's. For a detailed report on these sightings and the subsequent analysis of the beep- ing sounds, see pages 177 to 206 in the 1979 MUFON Symposium Proceedings. Quietly, I started making contacts and inquiries, looking for more cases. I attended a MUFON confer- ence in New Hampshire in the fall of 1992 to meet with my friends Colin Andrews and Dr. Steven Greer of CSETI to compare notes and update our research. Dr. Greer plays a portion of my beep tape at his lec- tures. Cheryl Powell, then a MUFON investigator, was in the audience and was floored when she heard the recording! She had one just like it, recorded by a New Hampshire family on their camcorder during an encounter with a huge, triangular-shaped craft that flew over their house in the spring of that year. Unfortunately, only the audio came out on the tape, the video part was black. Steven briefly introduced us and I was able to obtain a copy of her tape at a later date. I was stunned when I heard it; the phenomena was still happening! I was really excited by now and wanted to know more.

He filled me in on the UFO flap in the Pacific Northwest that was ac- companied by beeping sounds back in the 60's and 70's. The earlier cases from the 1960's were thoroughly in- vestigated by the Air Force and the Department of Civil Defense. These cases mostly occurred in the states of Washington and Oregon, along the Puget Sound. Ron also introduced me to Dr. Ronald Stearman, an Aerospace professor who was interested in analyzing any recordings that might be UFO-related. Dr. Stearman has some of the most commercially advanced, acoustical analysis software currently avail- able in the field. Now we should be able to get a better picture of how these various tapes from different loca- tions in North America look on paper. T he basic procedure currently employed in analyz- ing these sounds is to sample them with a digital signal analyzer and then obtain a graph of the sound in the frequency domain. Further characteristics of the signals were also determined after filtering. This included variable speed analysis and strip chart time domain studies. The outcome of these preliminary results show that the sounds are remarkably similar! The peaks associated with the beep frequencies all match up at about 1050 HZ with the median beep-fre- quency interval occurring at approximately 1.7 HZ. (The assumption has been made that the Orton tape was recorded at a slower than normal rate due to the electromagnetic influences that initially stopped the recorder. A speed reduction of approximately 18% was made on the Orton sound to bring it into the range of the other tapes. Otherwise, the spectral peak associ- ated with the beeping was found at 1350 HZ.) The beeps are roughly spaced at 0.6 to 0.7 seconds apart. The common spectral peak frequencies of the first four recordings varied only by 7 per cent. This varia- tion was expected due to the various types of recorders and generations of source tapes available for use. The Professor and his students have just finished another 50-page report for me, which I haven't fin- ished absorbing yet. They are using newer, higher- order auto-bicoherence spectrum analysis software in this most recent study. ANOTHER RECORDING Working with Greg Long, who is also interested in the phenomena that acoustics play in the UFO field, I was able to learn about the Yakima Indian Reservation sightings in Washington State that he wrote about in his recent book, Examining the Earthlight Theory â€” The Yakima UFO Microcosm (The J. Allen Hynek Center for UFO Studies, 1990). Beeping sounds were reported there as well, along with other locations in the state. While digging through his files, he found a cassette tape of beeping sounds recorded exactly one week to the day that they started for me in Orton, PAGE 6 NUMBER 318 OCTOBER 1994"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL Ontario, over 2,000 miles away! Recent analysis of this last tape reveals that it is almost identical to the previous four. OWLS 8w CONDON As I stated before, the UFO beeping noise cases from the 1960's caused quite a stir in the Pacific Northwest. The Air Force commissioned the University of Colorado to do a complete investigation and their findings were published in the now famous Condon Report of 1968. They concluded that these beeping sounds were being produced by a Saw-Whet Owl. Professor Stearman ob- tained recordings of the Saw-Whet Owl and did a de- tailed analysis of the owl versus the five beeping record- ings I had given him. His conclusions are completely different. He says we can rule out the Saw-Whet owl. But what the beeps are, or what they represent, is en- tirely up for speculation now. WHERE TO? There are several things I want you investigators to know. Not only do these mechanical beeping sounds occur before and after UFO sightings, but they appear to produce electromagnetic effects as well. Battery and electrical failures have been noted on car radios and engines, flashlights, hearing aids, and indoor lighting. Most astounding of all is that the beeping sounds have been heard being broadcast over AM/FM, CB, long wave and short wave radios. That's a pretty talented owl! In several cases that I have col- lected, those orange globes of light have been reported nearby. The beeps also affect the environment by causing excitement in animals, insects and humans, who report the unusual sounds to the police. Some note the date on their calendars or go out in search of the sound, which usually has no visible source. Others become afraid and return quickly inside because they \"can't stand it.\" The earliest case I have is from 1962 and the most recent case is from 1992â€”that's at least 30 years of this phenomena. While detailing all the locations on a map of North America, I have noticed that crop circles are appearing in clusters within a 50 mile radius of where these beeping sounds have been reported. T his is even more intriguing. I have a reliable group of professionals to help pursue any other cases that might surface. Right now I would like more infor- mation on a case that comes from Bilbao, Spain (UFONS, #170, September, 1987). A family wit- nessed a UFO for 3 hours over their house and got a half-hour tape recording of this strange whistle, \"sim- iliar to the sonar of a ship.\" Apparently it was ana- lyzed by audio frequency experts. This information was published in the Croniga, a newspaper in Buenos Aires, Argentina on March 12, 1983. The exact date of the incident is unknown at this time. Anyone with knowledge of this case or others such as I have described in this article are encouraged to write to me at P.U.R.E. Research, P. O. Box 627, Sebring, FL 33871.

Dr. Barry H. Downing When I published The Bible and Flying Saucers in 1968, the biblical book of Exodus played a central role in my analysis. I saw the \"pillar of cloud and of fire\" (Exodus 13:21,22), as an object that not only is de- scribed like a modern \"cloud-cigar\" type of UFO, but this UFO seemed to be in voice contact with Moses, whether at the burning bush, or at Mt. Sinai delivering the Ten Commandments. I spent about 20 pages ex- plaining the parting of the Red Sea as the probable work of the UFO propulsion system. In an article published in the May-June 1972 issue of Flying Saucer Review entitled, \"Radiation Symptoms in Exodus,\" I further examined some of the physical symp- toms of the UFO presence in Exodus in comparison with modern UFOs. What I did not do in my early research was speculate on the strategy of UFOs, either in the Bible, or now. I was doing UFO research as a Christian pastor and the- ologian. This made the whole enterprise a little tricky. Needless to say, my fellow Presbyterian clergy, as well as many members of my congregation, raised their eye- brows considerably when my book was published. I am in a denomination which gives strict examina- tions to those about to be ordained. Once one is or- dained, getting someone \"unordained\" is difficult. It requires a Presbytery trial. But I thought that for my sur- vival in ministry, I would be wise to express my theo- logical UFO research in problematic terms: I think it highly probable that a UFO parted the Red Sea, but I am not sure. My denomination has not made any threats to try me for heresy up to this point, so in that sense my caution has been rewarded. But if someone had asked me 25 years ago, \"What do you really think UFOs are doing?\" my answer would probably have been this: I think UFOs carry the angels of God. I think we are living in a dangerous time, and our scientific world viewâ€”bringing about the \"death of God theology\" which preceded my bookâ€”all indicate we need help believing that strange stories like the part- ing of the Red Sea, and the visibility of angels, are pos- sible. Once everybody comes to believe UFOs are real, then there will be a revival of faith in the Bible. Renewed faith in the Bible will lead to renewed faith in God, and in divinely designed human purpose. We will get rid of much of the agnostic depression that clouds our scientific generation. I also considered it possible that UFO appearances were a prelude to the Second Coming of Christ, and I brought up this possibility in chapter 6 of The Bible and Flying Saucers, but it did not seem to me that the kind of games UFOs were playing made sense as a pre- lude to the Second Coming. If UFOs want to land and take over, or if Christ wants to return in glory, why not just do it? But at the present time, unlike my views 25 years ago, I am inclined to think that the main purpose of UFOs is more political than religious. And because of that, I see Exodus as a paradigm of modem UFO strategy. CURRENT RELIGIOUS THEORIES As we think about the religious dimension of UFOs, there are three main theories (not counting mine): the \"Myth\" theory, the \"New Age\" theory, and the \"Demonic\" theory. The \"Myth\" theory, advocated by scientists like Carl Sagan, and theologians like Robert Ellwood, follows the lead of psychologist Carl Jung in calling UFOs a modern religious myth (unreal, a cre- ation of the human mind). But hardly anyone will bother belonging to MUFON if they think UFOs are myth. That leaves most MUFON members with a choice between the \"New Age\" theory and the \"Demonic\" the- ory. The first is wildly optimistic, the second wildly pessimistic. Early on, most MUFON members tended to see a New Age view of UFOs as created by air heads like Shirley MacLaine, not to be taken seriously. But lately UFO researchers like Donald Ware and Robert Dean have moved very much in a New Age direction. Richard Thompson has written a very creditable book, linking UFOs and Hindu Vedic literature, entitled Alien Identities. Further, as Timothy H. Heaton has so well pointed out in his review of John Mack's Abduction (MUFON UFO Journal, July 1994), scientific UFO re- searchers are horrified to find Mack has \"linked UFO encounters with all the shady New Age phenomena that the skeptics had always lumped it with, from shamanism to reincarnation.\" However much MUFON members may worry that a New Age interpretation of UFOs muddies our scientific credibility (and it does), nevertheless, New Age people are trying to answer a valid scientific question: What is the purpose of UFO behavior toward the human race? And the New Age answer is UFOs are pushing us to- ward a spiritual transformation of society which will usher in a golden age of peace, spirituality and love. I hope the New Age people are right, but I don't think they are. I think theirs is too optimistic an interpretation. But at the same time, I do not buy the standard con- servative Christian interpretation of UFOs, that they are demonic. The view that UFOs are demonic has long been promoted by writers like Clifford Wilson and John PAGES NUMBER 318 OCTOBER 1994"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL Weldon (Close Encounters: A Better Explanation), al- though neither of these men are UFO researchers. They use UFOs to promote their view of the impending Christian apocalypse, saying these are the end times, UFOs are demons set loose to bring us to repentance, then Christ will return. I.D.E. Thomas, in his recent book The Omega Conspiracy: Satan's Last Assault on God's Kingdom, also takes this approach. He believes UFO abductions, and the sexual activity of aliens, are from the world of fallen angels like those described in Genesis 6:4, that the \"sons of God came in to the daugh- ters of men, and they bore children to them.\" The de- monic theory of UFOs has support from serious UFO re- searchers like John White, and although Budd Hopkins would never align his abduction research with a religious theory, he certainly does not think UFOs are up to any good from our human point of view. Certainly there is much compelling evidence for some kind of demonic theory, whether secular or religious (See my article in The Encyclopedia of UFOs, ed. by Ronald Story, \"Demonic Theory of UFOs.\") But these two theories, the New Age and the Demonic, give us a good news/bad news choice. We can see UFOs as saviors here to bring in the Golden Age, or as tormentors doing us in for whatever reasonsâ€”reli- gious or genetic. At the same time, from a scientific as well as a religious point of view, we have to ask the question, do these theories give us the only choices, or the best choices? PARADIGMS AND SCIENTIFIC REVOLUTIONS In his book Abduction, John Mack refers to the work of his childhood friend Thomas Kuhn, author of the book, The Structure of Scientific Revolutions. It is Mack's view that UFOs are bringing about such a revolution in our time, that we are moving toward a new paradigm or model of scientific and human understanding. Kuhn has shown how new paradigms have arisen in our sci- entific past. In our struggle with UFOs, Mack says we are seeing a new paradigm emerge. I generally agree with this view. The question is: What is this new para- digm? What I want to suggest here is that the biblical book of Exodus may give us our best paradigm to under- stand current UFO strategy. And that paradigm sug- gests that UFOs are neither moving us toward a Golden New Age, nor toward a Demonic final conflict de- scribed in the book of Revelation, but rather, UFOs are simplyâ€”in space rocket termsâ€”giving us a course cor- rection. In one of his shortest parables Jesus said, \"The kingdom of heaven is like leaven which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal, till it was all leav- ened.\" (Matthew 13:33) This means that basic divine strategy is to carry out invisible or deceptively simple actions in human society which have significant long term consequences. Let me state my basic assumptions. My most basic one is that what we now call the UFO alien reality, and what the Bible calls the angelic divine reality, are the same reality, what I will call the alien/angelic reality. As I explained in \"The God Hypothesis\" (MUFON UFO Journal, October 1988), we can no longer simply think of UFOs as ET's, visiting us from another planet. I think Jacques Vallee is correct in seeing UFOs as es- sentially a control mechanism (The Invisible College, Dimensions). When MUFON was first formed, our ob- jectives were to find out where UFOs came from, and how UFOs were propelled. We tended to see UFOs as \"visitors\" from another planet, here to look us over. Perhaps in most ways they would be our equals, but a little more advanced technologically. Maybe they could give us a few technological tips. Some worried they might be here to take us over. But it did not seem to occur to anyone that they do not need to take us overâ€”they created us, and have guided hu- man history from the beginning. Whoever they are, the alien/angelic reality already owns us and controls us. I know of no major religious leader who has spoken the \"God Hypothesis\" out loud. And even among MUFON members, who as a group are more open to all possibil- ities than any other public forum I know about, still, we are not sure how to talk about this. We have tried to keep MUFON basically scientific, with the \"religious\" di- mension on the fringe. So we focus on abduction stories, hearing what \"they\" are doing to us, but having little idea of why. (Genetic manipulation, brain washing?) We are thankful when a scientist like Jack Kasher does a videotape analysis of UFOs taken from a space shuttle. But as brilliant as his analysis.is, it does not give us a clue about why UFOs are doing what they are doing. It is my assumption that the alien/angelic reality was involved in the development of both the Old and New Testaments, as well as perhaps providing stimulation to other religious leaders like Mohammed, or the devel- opment of the Hindu Vedic tradition. More modern re- ligious encounters might include, the Roman Catholic ex- perience at Fatima, and the Mormon experiences of Joseph Smith. But we are decades away from a thorough analysis of the religious traditions of the world in light of UFOs. OPPRESSORS, VICTIMS AND LIBERATORS But it is worth noting the similarities, and the differ- ences, between alien/angelic strategy in the Old Testament, and in the New. In the Exodus Story, and the Jesus Story, there is a triangle involving an oppressor, a victim, and a liberator. In the Exodus, Pharaoh, and the Egyptian political structure are the oppressors; Moses and the Hebrews are the victims, and the alien/angelic reality is the liberator (present in the \"pillar of cloud and of fire\"). OCTOBER 1994 NUMBER 318 PAGE 9"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL In the Jesus Story, the Hebrew religious establishment joins with the Roman political establishment in being the oppressor; Jesus is the victim, and again, the alien/an- gelic reality is the liberator, raising Jesus from the dead (Matthew 28; Luke 24), and converting the Apostle Paul from a \"bright light\" on the road to Damascus (Acts 9). A new community is formed of those who believe in the resurrected Jesus, and they undergo a new \"Exodus,\" driven out from the non-believing Jewish community. The alien/angelic objective in the Exodus was to form a distinct political/ethnic community, the Jewish people. They were given an unforgettable liberation ex- perience, including Passover, the parting of the Red Sea, and the Sinai wilderness journey for 40 years. They were given strict religious laws which set them apart from other nations. They were forbidden to marry out- side their race. To this day, they have maintained a dis- tinct identity, they have been, and are a \"light to the na- tions\" (Isaiah 42:6). I have no idea how we would mea- sure the impact of Jewish culture on Western society. What would modern science be without names like Albert Einstein and Robert Oppenheimer? But the alien/angelic objective in the Jesus Story was to form a community that transcended national bound- aries. The Jesus Story was to be preached to all nations (Matthew 28:19). Consequently, the Christian faith was not involved in an essentially political battle. The alien/angelic reality did not wage a humiliating battle against either the Jewish religious or Roman political es- tablishment. The Old Testament idea of the \"Promised Land\" was transferred to another world, to heaven. The Christian community thus had a minimum investment in what the political powers of this world did, or did not, do. THE EXODUS PARADIGM But this was not the case in Exodus. Exodus is the story of the alien/angelic reality waging a direct war against Pharaoh and the Egyptian political structure. Over a period of time Moses warned Pharaoh of plagues to comeâ€”flies, blood, gnats, frogsâ€”and finally Passover. The alien/angelic reality tells Moses to tell his children that the divine reality has \"made sport of the Egyptians and what signs I have done among them; that you may know that I am the Lord\" (Exodus 10:2). The final plague, the killing of the first-born of Egypt (Exodus 12), seems only too real in light of the ability of the modern alien/angelic reality to enter our homes at night and abduct whomever they want. Killing whomever they want would seem easier. It seems to me that modern alien/angelic strategy has been a direct war against the super powers of the world. George Knapp has returned with evidence from the former Soviet Union (see his article \"What the Russians Know About UFOs\" in the 1994 MUFON Symposium Proceedings), suggesting that UFOs hov- ered over Soviet missile bases, and even interacted with their control centers. We have similar stories in our American files (see Lawrence Fawcett and Barry Greenwood, Clear Intent). UFOs have frightened the su- per powers with their ability to interact with, and master, our technology. This attack on our technology may well have led to the nuclear \"thaw\" we are now enjoying, as well as causing the extreme secrecy in regard to UFOs practiced by the, governments of the world. Our world leaders, like Pharaoh, have been sure it is in their inter- est to deny the alien/angelic presence and power. The abduction phenomenon may be primarily a way for the alien/angelic reality to reveal its power to the public at large, and still keep its basic identity secret. We have all these stories that aliens from UFOs can read people's minds, can take them from their cars or bed- rooms without being stopped by the government or any- one else. Instead of being plagued with flies or frogs, we are being plagued with UFO abductionsâ€”and the broad- casting of their stories. UFOs are making sport of us, and our scientific culture. But at the same time, we do not know who they are. As I said in my article, \"The Rock of Ages Principle\" (MUFON UFO Journal, May 1990), one of the main pieces of strategy of the alien/angelic reality is to keep a curtain or veil between us and them. Moses was hidden in a rock, because no one could see God and live (Exodus 33). John Mack in Abduction makes frequent reference to the veil between us and the alien/angelic re- ality (pp. 32, 49, 327, 391, etc.). Thus on the basis of the biblical witness, the basic strategy of the alien/angelic reality has been to create life on earth, and to guide it according to its own purposes. These purposes include the tolerance of much evil (war, disease, death, even crucifixion, all manner of human de- ception), but with the promise we have been brought out into this wilderness of life to be tested, but the divine re- ality will do us good in the end (Deuteronomy 8:16). On this basis, it seems clear that the alien/angelic reality has made a huge investment in developing life on earth as we know it. Therefore the most likely para- digm for UFO strategy is to continue its objective of keeping human culture evolving, without landing and taking over directly. The cold war, with its threat of nuclear destruction, demanded direct political interven- tion. In the guise of \"space aliens,\" they have given us a political, military and scientific course correction. Up to this point, our religious values have hardly been touched by the alien/angelic presence. The Judaeo- Christian community, if it thinks about UFOs at all, sees them as a scientific problemâ€”just like MUFON. Such religious response as we have seenâ€”the New Age response, and the Demonic responseâ€”are in my opin- ion, overreacting. In regard to the New Age view, I don't think the alien/angelic reality is trying to make life better for us. They like us to suffer. The alien/angelic reality put the PAGE 10 NUMBER 318 OCTOBER 1994"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL Jews through all kinds of trials in the wilderness. The Bible gives the alien/angelic reality credit for killing 14,700 Jews with the plague during Korah's rebellion, not to mention another 250 by fire who were making an unauthorized religious offering (Numbers 16). Jesus encouraged his disciples to take up their cross and follow him. The alien/angelic reality wants us to suffer, they just don't want us to blow up their world with nuclear weapons, or perhaps bring earth to an environmental death. In regard to the Demonic view, the Christian com- munity has long expected the Second Coming of Christ promised in Acts chapter 1. The Jewish community ex- pected the second coming of Elijah (Malachi 4:5; Matthew 11:14; 17:11; 27:49). But it seems to me that either the second coming of Elijah, or the second com- ing of Jesus, would represent the end of the alien/angelic experiment as we have known it. And if the alien/angelic reality has spent thousands, perhaps millions of years, getting us to this point, I suspect their basic strategy is to maintain the system, or give it necessary course correc- tions, but not bring it to an end. It appears the UFO re- ality could land openly any time if it wanted to. Obviously, it does not want to. So I see Exodus as a paradigm of UFO strategy. It has been necessary for UFOs to attack the political, military and scientific structures of our time in order to pre- serve the future of human history. Science and tech- nology in the hands of our political leaders have been the \"oppressor\" of our modern age; all of us living in the shadow of nuclear terror are the \"victims\"; once again the alien/angelic reality has been the \"liberator.\" This does not mean we can count on the alien/angelic reality to save us always from our foolishness. As I have shown, they are not in principle opposed to suffering. But it does mean that we can be thankful the UFO real- ity has an investment in keeping human history on course with occasional course corrections. I suspect we have more trouble up ahead in human history, not a New Age. And I doubt UFOs are a demonic sign that the end of history is near. It seems likely that bringing down the curtain of human history is a choice the alien/angelic reality should make. But what I think we are seeing is Exodus as a paradigm of modern UFO strategy. A few plagues, making sport of our science and technology, signs for our children to wonder about, a course correc- tion. Down the road, as more UFO evidence comes outâ€” as we follow the pillar of cloud and of fire into our wilderness futureâ€”undoubtedly the human race will begin to explore the religious dimension to UFOs. When this happens, almost every world religion will undergo a pretty serious course correction. But right now the UFO leaven in our religious meal is fairly well hidden and will take time to do its work. The UFO reality could decide to speed up the \"un- veiling\" process any time, of course. Some kind of open display, even without direct contact, would finally wake up the religious community. And a display filled with paradox, like a UFO landing on the playing field during a nationally televised Notre Dame football game, would raise religious questions while keeping the \"veil\" in place. But whatever the future holds, I expect the alien/angelic reality to continue to abide by the \"rock of ages principle.\" That will still to be central to the Exodus paradigm in modern UFO strategy.

We do! by T. David Spencer, Deputy Director of Investigations A s most of us know, MUFON Field Investigators arrange their own time to conduct interviews, sometimes travel to remote locations, and some- times generate lengthy reports in order to document cases in which someone has observed or experienced an anomaly that might be associated with flying saucers. The investigator does this without any thoughts of re- ward other than the personal satisfaction of contributing information which might be an aid to UFO studies. There are almost 450 cases now recorded in the MU- FON UFO Report Database, and a total of 222 Field Investigators have taken part in making this possible. Of these contributors, 180 (over 80%) have participated in submitting more than one report. Although having an opportunity to investigate (learning of events to be in- vestigated) is a major reason for their multiple reports, it also takes a great deal of diligence and dedication to both properly investigate and document a reported sight- ing. It is a special honor to MUFON for an investigator to do this multiple times. The 21 who have contributed to five or more reports in the current database are: #1. 42 reports: #2. 40 reports: #3. 19 reports: #4. 12 reports: #5. 11 reports: #6. 10 reports: #7. 9 reports: #8. 8 reports: #9. 7 reports: #10. 6 reports: #11. 5 reports: Rex Salisberry, Florida. Carol Salisberry, Florida. C. Joseph Barron, Florida. Morton Schafer, Maine. Francis Ridge, Indiana. Richard D. Seifried, Oklahoma. Robert Taylor, Indiana. Shirley Coyne, Michigan. Bruce Engstrom, Indiana. Jean Waller-Seifried, Oklahoma. Norma Croda, Indiana. George K. Hoenig, New York. Cheryl Powell, New Hampshire. Robert E. Morgan, Texas. Ethan Rich, Colorado. Donald Worley, Indiana. Arnold Dunning, Maine. Hugh B. Horning, Delaware. K. O. Learner, Indiana, (deceased) Sandy Lepore, Rhode Island. Rex Schrader, Michigan. All of these investigators are to be applauded for their efforts. Without them, there could not be a data- base. I earnestly thank you for what you have accom- plished. There are many MUFON investigators who have followed up on cases without submitting their reports to MUFON and possibly a number of submitted reports sitting on the shelves of MUFON Directors awaiting approval. We are now getting more efficient in processing cases, and I urge you to dust off those reports and send them. Every report received will be carefully considered for inclusion in the database, and it should not be much longer before we have accumu- lated enough data for meaningful analysis. For database entry, current reports are considered first, after which older reports from the files in Seguin are studied, the most recent first. For these older files, I am now involved with reports received in 1988. In the database are five reports received from Canada, two from Brazil, one from Turkey, and one which occurred in Germany. It is much desired for this database to represent MUFON internationally. Although it is difficult to get translations done, we can make an effort on both the sending end and the receiv- ing end. It cannot start without reports being sent. I have heard concerns that reports just fall into a black hole, but let me assure you that no report received by the Deputy Director of Investigations will be disregarded.

The report re- ceived front-page coverage in the Sunday New York- Times (September 18), in USA Today and numerous other media outlets. Accompanying the report was a cover page titled \"Memorandum for Correspondents,\" reprinted here in its entirety. Secretary of the Air Force Sheila E. Widnall today an- nounced the completion of an Air Force study to locate records that would explain an alleged 1947 UFO inci- dent. Pro-UFO researchers claim an extraterrestrial spacecraft and its alien occupants were recovered near Roswell, N.M., in July 1947 and the fact was kept from the public. At the request of Congressman Steven H. Schiff (R- NM), the General Accounting Office in February 1994 initiated an audit to locate all records related to the Roswell incident and to determine if such records were properly handled. The GAO audit entitled \"Records Management Procedures Dealing With Weather Balloon, Unknown Aircraft, and Similar Crash Incidents\" is not yet complete. The GAO audit involved a number of government agencies but focused on the Air Force. In support of the GAO effort, the Air Force initiated a systematic search of current Air Force offices as well as numerous archives and records centers that might help explain the inci- dent. Air Force officials also interviewed a number of persons who might have had knowledge of the events. Prior to the interviews. Secretary Widnall released those persons from any previous security obligations that might have restricted their statements. The Air Force research did not locate or develop any information that the \"Roswell Incident\" was a UFO event nor was there any indication of a \"cover-up\" by the Air Force. Information obtained through exhaus- tive records searches and interviews indicated the ma- terial recovered near Roswell was consistent with a bal- loon device of the type used in a then-classified project. No records indicated or even hinted at the recovery of \"alien\" bodies or extraterrestrial materials. All documentation related to this case is now declas- sified and the information is in the public domain. All documentation has been turned over to the Air Force Historian. The Air Force report without attachments may be obtained by contacting Major [David] Thurston, Air Force Public Affairs, (703) 695-0640. The report with all 33 attachments is available for review in the Pentagon Library in Room 1A518. -END- The Fund for UFO Research responded with a press release titled \"Air Force Still Trivializes UFOs.\" The U.S. Air Force has once again dismissed a major UFO case by ignoring all the evidence which conflicts with its conclusion. In a report issued September 8, the 1947 \"Roswell Incident\" has been blamed on an ex- perimental balloon, despite the testimony of first-hand witnesses who describe totally un-balloonlike materials. The investigation of Air Force handling of the highly controversial case was conducted by the Air Force, as part of an audit by the General Accounting Office, at the request of Rep. Steven Schiff (R, NM). The Congressman had been rebuffed in his attempts to get answers from the Department of Defense, following complaints from constituents of an Air Force cover-up of the 1947 crash in the New Mexico desert. The Air Force report concentrates on bits of descrip- tion that make it sound like the material found on a sheep ranch near Corona, NM, in early July, 1947, could have come from a Project Mogul test balloon. It ig- nores the many statements from witnesses which de- scribe the unusual strength and light weight of what looked like metal foil and structural beams. All this in- formation is contained in a Congressional briefing book prepared by the Fund for UFO Research, from which the Air Force report quotes. According to the late Major Jesse Marcel, intelli- gence officer of Roswell Army Air Field, who was one of the first military people at the crash site, debris was scattered over an area 2/3 of a mile long and several hun- dred feet wide. There is no known way a few small, off- the-shelf balloons could have scattered material over 50 acres, since they were filled with non-explosive helium. By contrast, the remains of the airliner that [recently] crashed near Pittsburgh covered less than two acres. One of the main sources quoted in the report, Prof. Charles Moore, states that the material from such bal- loons, after being in the sun for a few days, would \"almost look like dark grey or black flakes or ashes ...\" How this could have been the \"shiny,\" \"metallic\" and \"indestruc- tible\" materials described by witnesses is hard to fathom. Moreover, it is insulting to highly-trained witnesses such as Major Marcel and his son (now an M.D., National Guard helicopter pilot and aircraft accident investigator) to suggest they could not recognize the materials of ordinary balloons. The Fund for UFO Research challenges the Air Force to produce a balloon of the type flown in early July, 1947, and ask the surviving witnesses if that is what they saw. If the Air Force is confident of its research, this should be accepted enthusiastically.

D.C.â€”U. S. Rep. Steve Schiff, R- N.M., today commended the Secretary of the Air Force for supporting the General Accounting Office's (GAO) audit of the \"1947 Roswell Incident\" by conducting a search of their own records, Schiff's office announced. Schiff, however, is concerned that the Air Force seemed to focus on UFOs and extraterrestrial beings and not the request that the GAO has been acting on since approached by the Congressman. \"My question about the Air Force report is whether it provides a complete accounting of all records dealing with the Roswell incident, regardless of their content. That was my specific request,\" Schiff said. \"At no time did I or the GAO state that my intent was to search for UFOs.\" Schiff has asked the GAO to assist him in finding the existing files that relate to Roswell and report back to him. At this time, the GAO's audit, entitled \"Records Management Procedures Dealing With Weather Balloon, Unknown Aircraft, and Similar Crash Incidents\" is not complete. \"I am hopeful that the Air Force's report will assist the GAO as they continue to work on their compre- hensive audit,\" said Schiff. \"Similarly, I am confident that the professionals at GAO will do their best to pro- vide the American people with a timely and well docu- mented review of their findings.\" CALL FOR ENTRIES 1994 Donald E. Keyhoe Journalism Award The Fund for UFO Research, a non-profit scientific or- ganization based in Washington, D.C., announces cash awards for the best articles or stories published or broad- cast in 1994 concerning the subject of Unidentified Flying Objects. The award was established in 1989 to honor the memory of Major Donald E. Keyhoe, a retired Marine Corps pilot and former director of the National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena. Maj. Keyhoe was an aide to Charles A. Lindbergh after the aviator made the first solo, non-stop flight from New York to Paris in 1927. During the 1930s, Keyhoe was a freelance writer whose work appeared in such publica- tions as The Nation, The Saturday Evening Post and Reader's Digest. He passed away on November 29, 1988. The recipient of the 1993 Donald E. Keyhoe Journalism Award was Ben Helwarth for his article on the UFO \"abduction\" phenomenon, which appeared in the October 19, 1993, edition of the Santa Barbara, CA, News-Press. Mr. Helwarth received a check in the amount of $1,000. Entries receiving Honorable Mention and a cash award of $50 in the competition were: â€¢ Freelance writer George W. Early of Mount Hood, OR, for his opinion piece, \"Facts Dictate Fresh Look at UFOs,\" in the June 24 issue of The Oregonian (Portland, OR); â€¢ Staff reporter Kathy Kemp for her series of articles on cattle mutilations and the UFO phenomenon, appearing in the Birmingham, AL, Post-Herald, February 22, 24, and 26; and â€¢ Bill Krasean, science and health writer for the Kalamazoo, MI, Gazette, for his June 29 article on hu- manoid sightings in conjunction with UFOs. ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS Any journalist working for a newspaper, magazine, radio or television station whose story on UFOs was pub- lished or broadcast between January 1 and December 31, 1994, is eligible to enter the competition. In order to be considered, the story must be submitted with an entry form, signed by the principal author of the story, and a newspaper or magazine clipping, audio cassette or videotape on VHS format. Foreign language stories must be accompanied by an English translation in order to be considered. A winning entry will be one whichâ€”in the opinion of the judgesâ€”makes the most significant contribution to public understanding of the UFO phenomenon. Entries should emphasize scientific research. Possible topics may be, but are not limited to: the U.S. Government's in- volvement in the UFO subject; the phenomenon of UFO \"abduction\" cases; or investigations into eyewitness re- ports of UFO sightings. Awards are made without regard to any particular theory about the source of the UFO phenomenon. Because the award was designed for the \"working press,\" entries from UFO publications will not be considered. The deadline for submissions is February 15, 1995. The panel will make its decision by April 1. Entries should be mailed to: Journalism Award, Fund for UFO Research, P.O. Box 277, Mt.

Fed up with hearing predominantly horror stories about peo- ple who have had negative experiences with Extraterrestrial Life. I am not saying that negative experiences don't happen. However, what about those of us who feel that their experiences have been posi- tive and spiritually uplifting? What about people like me? Yes, I've initially experienced shock, great shock, after seeing blood on my pillow upon awakening in the morning, when I had had no cuts on my face, or nose or ear bleeding. Yes, I was exhausted and frustrated when I couldn't sleep for nights on end because I had the feeling I was being watched or monitored. 1 was even more horri- fied when I would awaken in the middle of the night, paralyzed, with my eyes closed, feeling electric shock waves all over my body and strange whispering voices in my ears, and having my throat chakra hit with some sort of energy beam. Floating out of my window, para- lyzed, and being unable to open my eyes was no day at the beach either. Finally, in December 1989, after returning from the pyramids in the Yucatan peninsula of Mexico and going to bed exhausted, I woke up to find a \"Being\" at the foot of my bed. A \"Being\" with a form-fitting sil- ver jumpsuit, a pear-shaped head and black, wrap- around eyes. A Being that glowed in the dark. There are many days I would awaken from sleep with marks and scars I couldn't account for, and this has been going on for years. By now you're probably saying. Enough already! Where's the positive part of these experiences? Well, two weeks prior to this writing, I had another experience where a syringe-type object was injected into the back of my head, behind the right ear. Again, I was paralyzed and couldn't move. Yet, since these experiences have occurred, my life has become more exciting...no, not all at once, but little by little. I can- not tell you how often people have commented on how I've seemed to change; how peaceful and serene my energy is now; how my limited view of reality has expanded. A certain calmness and confidence has come over me. I am more accepting of myself as well as others, more open to Life and all of its endless possibilities. My psychic abilities have been enhanced, as has my conscious connection to the planet and all that is. In short, I am more loving. Let's avoid Intergalactic Racism. Sure, strange- looking Beings are unsettling at first, but that doesn't mean all are menacing. Let's at least try to keep an open mind and open heart. PS: I'm still having visitations and I'm happier for it. â€”Rev. M.J. Carter, M.S.C. New York, NY ROSWELL ON SHOWTIME I would like to thank you for publishing Larry Lowe's excellent review of \"Roswell\" in the August issue of the MUFON UFO JOURNAL. It's an eloquent and thoughtful article, and I'm happy that it was the basis of MUFON's message to its mem- bers about the film. Incidentally, our 16 share of the na- tional audience on our debut night was the second place all-time record for a Showtime broadcast and is consid- ered very high in the business. Of particular consequence for ufology, I think, is the fact that \"Roswell\" occupied the entire cover of the New York Times weekend TV supplementâ€”unheard of for a UFO fact-based film â€” and received surprise rave reviews in mainstream establishment newspapers such as the Washington Post and the Los Angeles Times, both of which have had generally anti-UFO biases in their news for many years. I'm enclosing for your records some of the more pertinent press clips for MUFON's use and interest. I do have to mention, though, that of some concern to me was the number of unfortunate errors of reporting in Debbie Stock's article in your July issue, which I felt should be called to your attention for correction. The ar- ticle gives an incorrect account of the development of the project because virtually all the dates are wrongâ€” surprising to me because I thought the interview was taped. The corrections are these. I first attempted producing Roswell in 1989, not 1983.1 did not begin this attempt prior to my daylight disc sighting (which was February 25, 1987) but two years afterwards, the sighting having propelled me toward giving the UFO subject serious attention. We did not have a commitment from HBO in 1983 to make the film as reported. And it did not take six years to jumpstart it once HBO pulled out. Our development deal with HBO began around July of 1991 and after putting a great deal into the development, they put it into turnaround (gave it back to me) in about January of 1993. It then took six months, not six years, to gain a commitment from Showtime, which contracted for the movie in July of 1993. Preproduction began by mid-September of last year. The point I made about the importance of the Roswell case was not that \"for the first and only time, the US Army (went) on record that they found some- thing crashed in the desert of New Mexico and they couldn't identify it,\" as I was quoted. The point was that the military officially, for the first and only time, OCTOBER 1994 NUMBER 318 PAGE 15"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL specifically announced the recovery of a downed fly- ing saucer, then retracted it. I do feel that these warrant correction, in the interest of maintaining the accuracy of the Journal. Additional information of note: The film will be re- leased on video by Republic Pictures. Expected time is about February of 1995, but if we are able to obtain a platformed theatrical release in the fall of this year, then video release (and its expected December return to Showtime) will be delayed. Theatrical release is under discussion but is not yet certain. This would follow the precedent set by the film \"Red Rock West\" (starring Dennis Hopper), which was also made for cable but had a subsequent theatrical release, even after its video sale. Again, I thank you for the special attention given to the film and especially for the excellent article by Larry Lowe in the August issue. â€”Paul Davids Los Angeles. CA RELIGIOUS SURVEY I am thankful to see MUFON showing wider interest in UFOs and religion, and the article by Victoria Alexander, \"The Alexander UFO Religious Crisis Survey: The Impact of UFOs and Their Occupants on Religion\" (September. 1994), is a good contribution to this expansion. And I am thankful to see the Bigelow Foundation supporting research of this type. Having said that, I could not help but notice that my name appeared frequently in her article, because, as a MUFON consultant, I have put forward views which, in Ms. Alexander's opinion, are not supported by the evi- dence. She refers to many of my articles, which gener- ally put forward my view that \"On the basis of my own experience, I know formal theology is not ready to begin a dialogue concerning the meaning of UFOsâ€”I have called out, and no one has answered.\" Ms. Alexander sent out 1000 questionnaires to Protestant, Roman Catholic and Jewish leaders, and on the basis of the response, concludes that the vast ma- jority of religious leaders do not see UFO contact as a threat to their faith. But what do we notice about Ms. Alexander's ques- tionnaire? She never uses the term \"UFO\" in her survey, or \"hot wire\" words like \"aliens.\" or \"abductions.\" How can you claim to be doing a UFO survey if you never use the term UFO in your survey? Ms. Alexander comes home from a religious party wearing a NASA dress and says it is obvious to her re- ligious leaders are not afraid of UFOs at allâ€”contrary to . what Barry Downing and others claim. This is not a creditable argument. There is not a question in the sur- vey that NASA might not have asked religious leaders. The survey was designed to be a \"non-threatening\" survey, and that is exactly what it is. So why be surprised that the majority of answers sound confident and un- afraid? The religious leaders were dealing with the science- fiction scenario of extraterrestrial contact, and they knew it. This is shown by the way they answered Alexander's question 7, \"Scientific confirmation of con- tact with an advanced extraterrestrial civilization is probable in our lifetime.\" The answers were basically \"No\" and ''Hell, no.\" Since this was all pretend anyway, religious leaders could paint themselves, and their con- gregations, as broad-minded 20th century folks with an eye turned toward a space age future. The only thing the Alexander survey proves is that religious leaders an- swered her questions the way they did. It proves nothing about religious leaders in relation to UFOs. In 1984 I conducted a UFO survey of American Protestant and Roman Catholic Seminariesâ€”I had a 26% return rate, slightly better than Ms. Alexander's. My first question was, \"Do you believe it is possible some UFOs carry an intelligent reality from another world?\" 1 think people knew right away from the first question, \"This is a UFO survey.\" My third question was, \"Have there been any formal studies of the relation between UFOs and Christian theology in your semi- nary classes? (For instance, has there ever been a sug- gested connection between UFOs and the biblical doc- trine of angels?)\" I don't see anything in the Alexander survey that even comes close to dealing with the reli- gious implications of my third question. And Ms. Alexander, who has obviously read my material care- fully, knows very well how wide ranging, and revolu- tionary, the implications of this question are for the Judeo-Christian tradition. MUFON members may wonder why I sent out my survey in 1984, but did not publish the results until 1988 in my Symposium article, \"UFOs: Four Questions for Theological Seminaries.\" The answer is, I did not do the survey for MUFON, I did it to try to invite the reli- gious and theological community to consider the theo- logical implications of UFOsâ€”exactly what Ms. Alexander wants us to do. After my results were written, I sent the articleâ€”just as MUFON printed itâ€”to seven major theological journals (Protestant and Roman Catholic), including one published by the seminary from which I graduated. My survey article was rejected by every publication. In discouragement, I then turned the article over to MUFON for publication. This does not prove the theological community is negative aboutUFO theology. They may love UFO the- ology, but hate the way I do it. But if that were the case, I should be seeing UFO articles appearing in these journals, written by those whom the editors deem com- petent. I don't see this happening. It is on this basis that I say, \"I have called out, and no one has answered.\" It has been a decade since my survey. Maybe there has been an opening up of the religious community to UFO theology since my survey. But unfortunately, Ms. PAGE 16 NUMBER 318 OCTOBER 1994"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL Alexander's survey gives us no information about UFOs and religion. Beyond that, I reject Ms. Alexander's basic premise, which is, that religious persons have no reason to be afraid of UFO beings because \"mankind could never perceive as a threat a race of beings without genitalia.\" This may be true for Freud, and for Ms. Alexander, but not for me. If UFO beings abduct me, take me on board a UFO, strip me naked, and jab needles into me, I plan to be afraid, whether these beings have genitalia or not. And I plan to be afraid for religious reasons: fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom. â€”Dr. Barry H. Downing Endwell, NY ROSWELL I owe Kevin Randle an apology for the tone of my crit- icism of his and Don Schmitt's approach to presenting evidence and testimony on the Roswell Incident (Julyâ€” not Augustâ€” Journal). As for the substance of that crit- icism and the other issues I raised, I urge your readers to get out their copies of the June, July, and September is- sues, carefully reread what Kevin and I wrote, and judge for themselves which of us has his facts straight and if the matters involved are mere \"little things\" or otherwise. To contribute to this consideration, I offer the fol- lowing: Re Frank Joyce: In his letter in the September Journal, Kevin states Frank Joyce told him in an un- recorded March 1989 interview he \"put Brazel's story on the air\" the evening of Sunday, July 6, and \"he didn't want to get into trouble and lose his job\" when ques- tioned about it by station owner Walt Whitmore, Sr. (This important information is not mentioned in either of Kevin's books about Roswell.) When I interviewed Joyce on November 3, 1992, he told me he \"caught hell\" from Whitmore when the story broke on July 8 and Whitmore learned Joyce knew about it two days be- fore and did nothing with it. Re the press release: In his September letter, Kevin says \"the pseudonymous Steve MacKenzie and Walter Haul have said the press release was part of the cover story.\" In fact, it is only the far from credible Frank Kaufmann (AKA Steve MacKenzie) who makes this claim. Walter Haul has told me more than once (most re- cently on September 14, 1994) he did not have the slightest inkling the press announcement he piit out might have been part of such a scheme. He says he thinks now it may have been, based on what he has heard in recent years from certain Roswell researchers. However, unlike Kaufmann, he claims no personal knowledge of this alleged deception. Re Jason Kellahin and Robin Adair. Kevin avers \"Kellahin has altered his story significantly,\" presumably from that which he told Kevin in January, 1993.1 have viewed Kevin's videotape of that interview, and there is no important difference in Kellahin's account from what he told me in May 1993 and later verified in a signed af- fidavit (see pp. 158-159 in my Roswell in Perspective, available for $28.00, shipping and handling included, from the Fund for UFO Research, PO Box 277, Mount Rainier, MD 20712). As for Adair, Kevin says I re- jected his testimony \"out of hand,\" dismissing it in a footnote in RiP. In fact, I followed up on what Adair told me, and it did not check out. As a matter of courtesy to a very nice old man, I chose not to detail in print what clearly was a flight of fancy, addressing the matter with the following end note reference: \"I also interviewed Robin Adair (audiotaped personal interview, May 25, 1993). He spun an interesting yarn which was so at odds with known facts (including his position and status at AP [Associated Press] in 1947) that I believe it must be discounted entirely\" (RiP, ch. 3, note 43, p. 99). â€”Karl T. Pflock Placitas, NM MORE ON RELIGION The September 1994 article and research reported therein by Victoria Alexander addresses the alleged \"UFO Religious Crisis.\" It makes two points: 1) It as- serts that a majority of surveyed religious leaders did not view \"extraterrestrial\" contact as a threat to Judeo- Christian religion; 2) It also asserts that this contradicts the previously held view by ufologists that there is such a threat, a threat that may help explain the Government lid on UFOs. The purpose of this letter is to show that Assertion #2 does not follow from Assertion #1 because of her survey. That is, Ms. Alexander's survey is fatally flawed both in form of its questions and its recipients. It asked anti- septic questions of ignorant recipients who would not know enough to be afraid of a \"gray\" if one floated into their bedroom. As to the ignorance, she admits re- garding her question No. 8 that the surveyed theologians \"have not been exposed\" to \"reported UFO contacts and alien abductions.\" Hence those theologians clearly are ignorant about what is \"really\" going on. As to the questions themselves, they hardly served to correct their ignorance. By her own words they were all expressly written to exclude \"hot wire\" words like \"abduction,\" \"aliens,\" etc. In other words, they were asked about theoretical contact with \"extraterrestrials\" in a way that envisions human-like starfarers landing peacefully on the White House lawn, asking to see the President. Of course such a contact will not be perceived as a threat to religion. But ask them about a \"worst case\" scenario, and you might get a different answer, one more attuned to the emotions such real contact produces. Please understand, I do not necessarily accept the view that UFO aliens, gray or otherwise, are truly a threat to organized religion. Certainly I for one did not change my religious views as I became informed on this subject. Nor do I see why such aliens cannot fit in OCTOBER 1994 NUMBER 318 PAGE 17"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"MUFON UFO JOURNAL conventionally, e.g., as \"angels\" (good, bad or other- wise). What I do feel needs to be asked of theologians is a more difficult question: \"Assume that you or a loved one has been repeatedly abducted, sexually involved with, and instructed by, nonhuman-looking aliens, the memory of which has been gradually realized. Now do you think such happenings on a wide scale are likely to be a threat to conventional religious establishments?\" That is a much different question than the ones she asked, and more to the point. Perhaps Ms. Alexander can obtain an- other grant to ask these questions. â€” Dana Schmidt Assistant State Director Rochester, NY ..The UFO PRÂ£SS Some items have arrived recently at the MUFON of- fice which we have not yet had time to review fully.

It involved the recovery by the U.S. Military of material alleged to be of ex- traterrestrial origin. The event was announced by the Army Air Force on July 8, 1947 through a press release carried by newspapers throughout the country. Tt was subsequently denied by what is now believed to be a cover story claim- ing the material was nothing more than a weather balloon. It has remained veiled in government secrecy ever since. The press release announcing the unusual event was issued by the Commander of the 509th Bomb Group at Roswell Army Air Field, Colonel William Blanchard, who later went on to become a four-star general and Vice Chief of Staff of the United States Air Force. That the weather balloon story was a cover-up has been confirmed by indi- viduals directly involved, including the late General Thomas DuBose, who took the telephone call from Washington, D.C., ordering the cover-up. Numerous other credible military and civilian witnesses have testified that the original press release was correct and that the Roswell wreck.iije was of extraterrestrial origin. One such individual was Major Jesse Marcel, the Intelligence Officer of the 509ih Bomb Group and one of the first military officers at the scene. On January 12, 1994, United States Congressman Steven Schiff of Albuquerque, New Mexico, announced to the press that he had been stonewalled by the Defense Department when requesting information on the 1947 Roswell event on behalf of constituents and witnesses. Indicating that he was seeking further investigation into the matter, Congressman Schiff called the Defense Department's lack of response \"astounding\" and concluded it was apparently \"another government cover-up.\" History has shown that unsubstantiated official assurances or denials by government are often meaningless. Nevertheless, there is a logical and straightforward way to ensure that the truth about Roswell will emerge: an Executive Order declassifying any information regarding the existence of UFOs or extraterrestrial intelligence. Because this is a unique issue of universal concern, such an action would be appropriate and warranted. To provide positive assurance for all potential witnesses, it would need to be clearly stated and written into law. Such a measure is essentially what presidential candidate Jimmy Carter promised and then failed to deliver to the American people eighteen years ago in 1976. If, as is officially claimed, no information on Roswell, UFOs, or extraterrestrial intelligence is being withheld, an Executive Order declassifying it would be a mere formality, as there would be nothing to disclose. The Order would, however, have the positive effect of setting the record straight once and for all. Years of controversy and suspicion would be ended, both in the eyes of the United States' own citizens and in the eyes of the world. If, on the other hand, the Roswell witnesses are telling the truth and information on extraterrestrial intelligence does exist, it is not something to which a privileged few in the United States Government should have exclusive rights. It is knowledge of profound importance to which all people throughout the world should have an inalienable right. Its release would unquestionably be universally acknowledged as an historic act of honesty and goodwill. / support the request, as outlined above, for an Executive Order declassifying any U.S. Government information regarding the existence of UFOs or extraterrestrial intelligence. Whether such information exists or whether it does not, I feel that the people of the world have a right to know the truth about this issue and that it is time to put an end to the controversy surrounding it.

The ringed giant resumes direct (east- ward) motion on the 9th. Bright Planets (Morning Sky): Venus (-4.4) becomes visible in the ESE dawn sky by mid- month. View its large narrow crescent phase in a small tele- scope or even binoculars. The bright planet lies within about 5Â° of faint orange Mercury from November 12-15. and less than 3Â° from the lunar crescent on the 30th. Mars is high in the S at dawn. Jupiter (-1.7), in Libra, does not reappear until late in the month. At that time it rises about an hour before the Sun. re- maining very low in the ESE. Penumbra! Lunar Eclipse: On the night of November 17-18, the full moon grazes the Earth's shadow. Observers across North America should no- tice a slight darkening of the Moon's upper limb beginning about midnight. Our satellite slides deeper into the Earth's light outer shadow (penumbra), reaching mideclipse at 1:44 AM EST. The Moon exits the shadow at 4:02 AM. Meteor Shower: The South Taurid meteors climax on the moonless night of the 2nd-3rd, achieving a predawn rate of about 10-15 per hour. Though not numerous, the Taurids do produce some bright, slow-moving fireballs. Moon Phases: New moon â€” November 3 First quarterâ€” November 10 Full moon â€” November 18 Last quarter â€” November 26  Cm The Stars: This month places the 6 constellations of the royal family leg- end into prominence â€” the king and queen of Ethiopea, Cepheus and Cassiopeia, their daughter Andromeda, the sea monster Cetus, the warrior Perseus, and his flying horse Pegasus. The intricate story culminates when Perseus, re- turning on Pegasus from his battle with Medusa, rescues Andromeda from the jaws of Cetus. Perseus displays the cut- off Medusa's head whose stare turns the monster to stone! Wintry Orion, Taurus, Auriga, and Gemini show up in the E at 9PM. IN MEMORIUM John Magor 1915-1994 On September 3, 1994, Canada lost yet another of its pioneers in the field of ufology. John Magor observed and reported on the UFO scene from his home in Duncan, British Columbia. He was a MUFON Field Investigator and British Columbia's first Provincial Director for MUFON and served in that capacity for many years. But it is for his writing and reportage that John was best known. John Magor was editor and publisher of the well- known journal, Canadian UFO Report, which had a run of over ten years, a landmark achievement in Canadian publishing for any type of magazine. CUFOR boasted well-known contributors and corre- spondents, and had many subscribers worldwide, and brought countless important â€” and otherwise unknown â€” Canadian UFO cases to a global readership. John was also the author of three excellent books on the UFO phenomenon. His first. Our UFO Visitors, was published in 1977, and was followed by Aliens Above. Always in 1983. His most recent and final work was Pagans in My Blood, published in 1993. John Major was born in Passaic, New Jersey and held a M.S. degree in Journalism. He was an editor for Cavalcade News Magazine in England, a freelance reporter in Washington, D.C., and British United Press parliamentary correspondent in Ottawa. John was also the publisher of the newspapers Prince Rupert Daily News and the Cowichan Leader, both in British Columbia. During World War II, John served for three years in the Royal Canadian Air Force. John Magor's contributions to the field of ufology have had a vast impact on research in Canada and worldwide. He will be sorely missed by his friends and colleagues. John Magor is survived by his wife Lillian, daughter Liz, and sons Don, John and Brad. He is pre- deceased by a son, Bob.

WESTERN REGION DIRECTOR VACANCY Robert J. Cribble (Seattle, WA), Western Regional Director, submitted his resignation effective July 25, 1994. His four-year term would have normally expired in December 1994. MUFON is now actively seeking candidates for this prestigious position on the Board of Directors to fill the vacancy. The Western Region is composed of the following mountain states: Montana, Wyoming, Colorado, New Mexico, and all of the states west of these including Alaska and Hawaii. We are so- liciting individuals who have had previous MUFON leadership positions such as State Director, Assistant State Director, and State Section Director as examples. If you are interested in accepting greater leadership re- sponsibilities, please write to Walt Andrus expressing your desire to fill this role and your qualifications. As of this date, only one candidate has volunteered his ser- vices. Until such time as a new Western Regional Director is elected, all State Directors in the western region of states should send their completed UFO sighting re- ports directly to the Deputy Director Investigations, T. David Spencer, 6700 Woodcrest, Austin, TX 78759. DIRECTOR OF LEGAL AFFAIRS VACANCY The recent resignation of Kenneth A. Wong, J.D. as Director of Legal Affairs has created an opportunity for one of MUFON's 32 Consultants in Law to volun- teer to fill this vacancy on the MUFON Board of Directors. The position is basically to head up and co- ordinate our diversified nation-wide legal staff and pro- vide legal advice to the MUFON Board of Directors upon request. To date, we have received only one ap- plicant. Please give this opportunity your serious con- sideration. We invite interested attorneys to contact Robert H. Bletchman, J.D., 360 E. Center Street, Manchester, CT 06040-4440; telephone (203) 643-2433 or Walter Andrus in Seguin, TX at (210) 379-9216. FIELD INVESTIGATORS MANUAL OUT OF PRINT The third edition of the MUFON Field Investigator's Manual is temporarily out-of-print. It has been removed from the MUFON Publications List. Work is progress- ing very well on publishing an expanded version to be identified as the fourth edition in the near future. Please do not delay conducting Field Investigator training classes due to the absence of the fourth edition. Some sections or chapters of the present manual are only be- ing updated, whereas new sections on abduction inves- tigations, animal mutilations, crop circles, and poly- graph will be added. Explicit instructions on completing Form 1 and Form 2 will also be new. The expanded sec- tion on interviewing witnesses by Dan Wright will be another asset to the new manual. The availability date and price will be announced in the Journal. Please do not back order the new manual since it will be doubled in si/e. and the price has not been determined from the printer. We are very excited about the fourth edition, since it will be a state-of-the-art publication. We are targeting late 1994 for its publishing date. David Spencer T. David Spencer was elected to the MUFON Board of Directors Executive Committee to fill the vacancy created by the untimely passing of Jerold R. Johnson. Mr. Spencer is the UFO Database Administrator and will assume the addi- tional responsibility of Deputy Director - Investigations. David earned a bachelor's degree in physics plus post-graduate studies in physics and operations research at Texas A&M. He took an early retirement from I.B.M. in Austin. Texas, where he was an advisory system analyst. His pri- mary interest in the UFO phenomenon is data- base classification and statistical studies of re- ported phenomena, evidence, and involvement with field investigation. In conjunction with Austin-MUFON. he re- cently published a training guide for instructors teaching field investigator training classes, which will be made available to MUFON members to supplement the MUFON Field Investigator's Manual. (See page 7.) Mr. Spencer is eminently qualified to till the im- portant position of Deputy Director - Investigations. For him to be successful, he will need the support and cooperation of MUFON's entire team of field investigators and state/provin- cial directors.
