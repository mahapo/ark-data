Two minutes later it went away, then came back, went away again and came back a third time. On the third pass it \"bombed\" them, dropping a ball of fire that exploded in their path. For more than 40 years Brazil has been the scene of numerous, frequent and sometimes bizarre UFO incidents and it continues to be a UFO hot spot to this day, with no ap- parent let up in the numbers of sightings and encounters. The \"bombing\" episode was a throwback to the \"bad old days\" of UFOs in northern Brazil that ran roughly from 1975 to 1985. That was a time when UFOs did harmful things to people, often in a crude fashion, at least as humans interpret these events. It was a time when UFO occupants used grappling hooks to try to snatch people off the ground and draw them up into the object, or dropped hot liquids on their arms as they desperately clung to trees or plants to keep from being sucked up into the UFOs by some un- seen force. It was a time when UFOs would suddenly and silently appear just over the head of people walk- ing in the interior at night, explode in a burst of blinding light and then chase them as they fled in terror. And it was a time when a number of people were burned or injured, sometimes leaving them permanently im- paired, and at least half a dozen people dead during or soon after encounters. Whether those days have ended is not certain. UFOs are still being seen, apparently as often as ever, and most close encounters these days usually end without the UFOs inflicting any harm on the witnesses. However, an 8-year-old girl and a 12-year-old girl suffered burns similar to sunburns in separate encounters during a flap that began in April 1991 in northwestern Ceara and is continuing sporadically. In addition, some people feel paralyzed during the initial stages of an encounter, and others report UFOs use spotlights to search for them as they hide in bushes or trees. In virtual- ly all close encounters, the witnesses are terrified. In September, we made a 26-day visit to 30 cities, towns and villages and nearly as many remote rural areas in north and central Brazil. Many of these places can be reached on- ly by driving over bone-jarring roads and rough dirt lanes. We interviewed 38 witnesses who had a total of 42 encounters or sightings, at least four as recently as the week before. One man told us he had seen a \"fogo\" or ball of fire (a typical description of a UFO in much of Brazil) moving slowly above the sand dunes near the coast just the night before. In addition, we heard about several hundred other cases and were given detailed reports on 18 from generous and very hospitable Brazilian researchers. At least 19 investigators in the states of Ceara, Paraiba, Rio Grande do Norte, Rio de Janeiro and Minas Gerais gave up free time to take us to witnesses in some of their best cases and help us in every way possible. (See end note.) Of the 60 cases we investigated or received from local in- vestigators, 20 percent occurred in 1991 and nearly half in the past three years. This was a surprise, because when we began we thought we would get mostly old cases. Many researchers in the U.S., Brazil and other countries believe UFO occupants are kind, benevolent creatures who have come here to help us. But UFOs have a bad reputation in all the areas of Brazil that we visited. Even if no physical harm is done, the witnesses nearly always tell us their encounters were terrifying experi- ences. UFOs have been around for so many years that virtually everyone seems to be aware of them. BURNS Every witness we talked to on this trip believes AND UFOs will take you away if they get the chance. OTHER In the tropical forests and jungles of the states INJURIES of Para and Maranhao, many people call UFOs ARE \"the Chupa-Chupa\" (from the verb chupar, QUITE meaning \"to suck\") and they believe UFOs COMMON suck all the blood from people they abduct. Most encounters occur at night and people some- times get hurt as they flee in panic. In the dark they run into barbed wire fences, holes or other obstacles, or poisonous bushes whose milky sap that flows when branches are broken can blind a person. During a period of frequent sightings and encounters in the Amazon in 1980 and 1981, fishermen stopped fishing at night because when the UFOs came down to hover over them they were forced to run into the jungle and they were afraid of stepping on poisonous snakes. Most of the 60 cases we heard about in our September trip were fascinating because something happened in each Cynthia Newby Luce, MUFON's representative for Eastern Brazil, was born in California. In 1975, she moved to Sao Jose do Vale do Rio Preto, a village in the mountains about 100 miles E/NE of Rio de Janeiro. She speaks fluent Portuguese. Bob Pratt is a former editor of the Mufon UFO Journal and has interviewed some 1600 UFO witnesses in ten countries in the course of his career, many of them during eight visits to Brazil. With Dr. J. Allen Hynek and Philip J. Imbrogno, he co-authored Night Siege: The Hudson Valley UFO Sightings (Ballantine, 1987). MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 285 January 1992"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"that made it more than a \"routine\" sighting or encounter. One man died, several were seriously injured, at least two of them permanently; others were \"persecuted\" by UFOs that used lights to search for their hiding places; three were blinded for three to ten minutes as the UFOs \"exploded\" in massive, silent blasts; one man was \"romanced\" for six months in 1990 by a UFO that waited for him every night he went out on his motorcycle and then followed him until he reached town; and at least four were victims of crude attempts to kidnap them. (The term \"attempted abduction\" doesn't seem ap- propriate in light of the abduction phenomenon that has come to dominate American ufology these days.) However, what impressed us most was the realization that no one has any idea just how great and frequent the UFO activity is in Brazil (or perhaps anywhere else in the world). It is very possible that there are 10,000 to 100,000 times as many sightings and encounters as any of us are aware of. That may sound like a rash statement, but we consider it a con- servative estimate. B razil is huge, as large as the United States, and has more than 150 million people. Yet, there are probably no more than 300 to 400 serious, active investigators, most of them living in the major cities. Like investigators everywhere in the world, they are able to devote only several days a month to investigations, and then usually only on cases that occur near their home cities. Vast areas of most states, and sometimes entire states, have no investigators at all. Much that happens, perhaps most, never comes to the attention of any investigator. In 1977, for example, UFOs were seen virtually every night for four months in and near the city of Pinheiro in the state of Maranhao, and the mayor estimated 50,000 people in his region had seen the UFOs. Many fishermen and farmers said they had been chased and sometimes hurt or burned by the UFOs. Yet Brazilian investigators learned of this only a year and a half later when an American reporter happened to go to Pinheiro. A flap of such magnitude probably would not go unnoticed these days. The population is ever increasing, more paved highways are being built in the interior, electricity is spreading farther into rural areas, satellites now bring TV to even the remotest parts of the country, and Brazilians and the news media are much more aware of the UFO phenomenon today than they were in the 1970s. Furthermore, camcorders are becoming ubiquitous and a number of videotapes of spectacular sightings have been shown on national TV. In May, viewers were shown the video of a dazzling display in the sky above the small city of Casimiro de Abreu, 140 kilometers northeast of Rio de Janeiro. One investigator in Sao Paulo has even developed a sideline col- lecting, copying and selling such videos. Still, we believe many \"mini-flaps\" and most encounters go unrecorded because there are no investigators in so much of the country. Having said all that, we must add that there are enormous regions where there is no electricity or running water, few good roads, the people are quite poor, unsophisticated and have little awareness of the outside world. The point is that no matter where we went in September in towns or the rural areas (we were in more than one home that had dirt floors), we were always able to find someone, and often a number of people, who had had a UFO experience. Altogether we traveled about 4,000 kilometers in northern and central Brazil by car, covering only a tiny part of this MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 285 January 1992"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"huge and beautiful country. We feel any investigator could go into any community in the country and find witnesses. This may also be true in any other country in the world. In the 50 or so areas we visited, 12 encounters occurred in 1991. There were actually many more because of the flap in western Ceara, where UFO investigators had confirmed 25 cases and had a backlog of reports to check out. If the total of 12 cases in 50 areas is any indication, then there could easily have been 25,000 to 35,000 sightings and encounters throughout the country during the first ten months of 1991 because Brazil has more than 100,000 communities and vast, remote rural areas where so many encounters seem to occur. The second most impressive finding was the striking parallels between some of the cases we looked into this time and other cases investigated by Bob Pratt in seven earlier trips to Brazil. Some examples: HOT OIL No. 1 In February 1979, 78-year-old Januncio was interviewed at his 500-hectare cotton ranch 14 kilometers southeast of San- ta Cruz in the state of Rio Grande do Norte. On one evening five weeks earlier he had visited friends five kilometers away and was walking home in the dark between 8 and 9 p.m. About halfway home Januncio lit a cigarette. He resumed walking and seconds later a brightly-lit object shaped like a cylinder, standing upright, suddenly appeared several meters above him. A door opened on the bottom and he could see two people sitting inside. Hot light flooded out, engulfing Januncio, who felt himself being pulled upward by some in- visible force. Terrified, he grabbed a small palm tree and wrapped his arms and legs tightly around the trunk. Three times he was pulled up by the UFO and each time he slid slowly back down the trunk, scraping the skin on his arms and chest. After the third time, the beings dropped something like melted wax or hot oil on his upper arms, burning them. Januncio, fearing for his life and crying, still wouldn't let go. Then the door suddenly closed and the UFO disappeared swiftly into the sky. Januncio was sick for two days with headaches and unable to eat. His arms and chest were almost raw and he had blisters on his arms. He refused go out at night anymore. HOT OIL No. 2 In September, 12 years later, we returned to Santa Cruz, where we heard about a man named Beato. He lives 20 kilometers southeast of Santa Cruz, most of it over narrow dirt lanes and some distance beyond Januncio's farm. Beato, now 51, told us he had been visiting a friend's house one night late in 1979 (in the dry season between August and November is all he remembers) and was walking home be- tween 7 and 8 p.m. He lit a cigarette and seconds later a UFO swooped down and hovered above him. It was round, bluish, had two windows through which he could see two people inside, and it was shining an incredibly bright and hot light down on him. Beato was very frightened as he felt himself being sucked up. He quickly squatted down and grabbed a plant to keep from going any farther. After a short while the occupants dropped something like hot oil on his upper right arm, but Beato still refused to let go of the plant. The UFO then rapid- ly went away. Beato's arm had small blisters but he suffered no other ill effects. However, he wouldn't go outside for a long time and he's still wary of lighting a cigarette outside after dark. HOOK No. 1 In September we also interviewed Hermelindo, whose en- counter is one of the more celebrated cases in Brazilian ufblogy. He lives near the village of Vargem Grande in Vale das Velhas, or the Valley of the Old Women, an hour's drive north of Belo Horizonte in the state of Minas Gerais in central Brazil. About 2 a.m. on September 9, 1976, Hermelindo was walking to his home about 300 meters from the village and was near- ing a small bar he owns when a big light came on just above him. He rah around the end of the bar and tried to unlock the back door. He couldn't get the door open so he decided to run to his home 35 to 40 meters farther on. As he started running, four cables with hooks on them came down from the UFO. At the same time a small being in gray clothes also came down and grabbed Hermelindo. The being was much smaller and they began fighting. Hermelindo was much bigger and he managed to get the creature in a bear hug — he said it was as hard as steel — but almost instantly the creature gave a \"tremor.\" This startled Hermelindo, who relax- ed his grip. In an instant the creature put one of the hooks on Hermelindo's left ankle and he was quickly yanked up toward the UFO with his head down and his arms and other leg flailing. The UFO, then five to eight meters above the ground, moved toward Hermelindo's house, reeling Hermelindo up as it moved. As he neared the opening on the bottom of the UFO, his right leg hit the outside and he was jarred loose from the hook. Hermelindo fell into a large yucca plant and suffered scratches and cuts all over his body. His brother-in-law had watched the whole incident from a window in the house. Hermelindo, who had bruises on his legs, was in shock all night and was sick for several days. HOOK No. 2 Shortly after dark one evening in November 1979, 76-year- old Antonio, recently widowed, was working in a garden one kilometer from Santo Antonio, a small city south of Natal in the state of Rio Grande do Norte and about 60 kilometers east of Januncio's farm. He saw a light flying near him and he started to hurry home. Antonio had gotten only a few steps when the object shined a light down on him. He had heard of flying saucers MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 285 January 1992"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"I/ and immediately lay face down on the ground, hoping that would save him. The light came closer and Antonio sudden- ly found himself yanked about half a meter off the ground. He quickly grabbed a plant and held on tightly to keep from going any farther. As he hung there, he twisted around and saw that a cable with a four-pronged hook had come down from the object, four or five meters above him, and one of the hooks had caught the back of his shirt. The object was brown and cigar-shaped. Through a win- dow he could see two women and a man. The women were \"ugly\" and were wearing yellow dresses and the man had a beard. They were talking. He was very frightened, especially when he heard one of the women say: \"Here is a nice old man we can take with us to our earth.\" After 10 to 15 minutes, Antonio's shirt tore and he fell to the ground. The UFO spun around several times and went away. He was sick for a week and never again went outside at night. There have been a number of cases in which the witness felt he or she was being sucked upward toward a UFO by some unseen force. Some sample cases: ABDUCTION ATTEMPT No. 1 The same day Januncio was interviewed in 1979, we had also talked with a 45-year-old woman named Francisca, who lived 40 kilometers west of his farm. Just three weeks earlier she and her daughter, Josefa, 13, were walking home about 11 o'clock one night when a big light suddenly appeared at the top of the hill beyond her house. Francisca called it \"The Animal.\" To her, it looked like an opened umbrella shining brightly. It quickly grew bigger and brighter. The woman and her daughter were 200 meters from their house. When the light got within 50 to 100 meters, it shined a light down toward them. Francisca told Josefa to run. Josefa begged her mother to run too, but Francisca found herself caught in the light and couldn't move. She started to rise off the ground. Josefa grabbed her and pulled her down, but the force of the light was too strong and Francisca con- tined moving upward. She screamed at Josefa to save herself, and the girl ran. Francisca continued rising and felt as if she was inside a noiseless tornado. She believes she rose 20 meters above the ground and was drawn about 40 meters toward the UFO. Then the silent \"wind\" suddenly stopped and she was lowered to the ground, dazed but not hurt. The object swung back and forth in an arc for several seconds and then went away. Francisca, her body tingling all over, was terrified. She was numb for two days and suffered severe headaches for a week. She was almost hysterical as she told her story. ABDUCTION ATTEMPT No. 2 In September we interviewed Geraldo and his wife Angela, who live near Jequitiba in the Valley of the Old Women in central Brazil. Geraldo, now 38, a farmer, and Angela, 37, were walking home in the dark about 10 p.m. on the night of November 1, 1983. A big light suddenly appeared 300 to 400 meters away, lighting up the area behind them. Geraldo looked back over his shoulder and saw it coming toward them. The light was bluish-white, like a soldering torch. All he could see was a dark form. It came down close and he felt something touch his shoulder. He reached back and felt something like a soft towel. Then he suddenly found himself suspended about 70 centimeters off the ground and carried for about ten meters. Angela grab- bed him and pulled him down, screaming in fright all the while. They then ran into the bushes and hid. Several minutes later the object disappeared and Angela fainted. Geraldo car- ried her the rest of the way home. MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 285 January 1992"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"For months Geraldo suffered from nausea, chest pains and insomnia, and ever since that night has had headaches almost every day. His vision was affected and he couldn't drive for about a year, because he was unable to focus his eyes on anything for long without getting dizzy. It was three years before he would go outside at night. CONCLUSION Many other incidents that occurred between 1975 and 1985 were similarly crude, but there appears to be much less of that type of UFO behavior these days. Still, the terror is ever present, some people still get hurt or burned, and the \"bombing\" of the couple on their motorcycle mentioned at the beginning of this report makes you wonder whether anything has changed at all. Both the husband and wife in the \"bombing\" incident — he is 34, a public employee and owner of a small sidewalk lunch stand, and she is 33 — felt momentarily paralyzed when the UFO first appeared overhead. The motorcycle coughed, sput- tered to a stop and both were scared to death and began panicking. The UFO shined a light down at them for two minutes, but to them it seemed a century. It went away and they got the motor- cycle going again. They drove another kilometer or two farther down the highway when the UFO came back, hovered over them, and again disappeared in seconds. Several kilometers farther on, it came back a third time. This is when it dropped the ball of fire in front of them as it passed overhead. The wife screamed and the husband instantly braked, just as the ball of fire exploded a meter or two in front of them. The explosion was brilliant but made no noise. They believe that if he hadn't put the brakes on when he did they would have been in the midst of the explosion. The next day the wife had blisters on her face but she believes they came from the initial exposure to the UFO and not from the explosion. Whether there have been any more harmful actions on the part of UFO occupants, only further research will tell. One thing is certain, though. UFO activity is always interesting in Brazil and it has never stopped. We wish to express our deep appreciation to all the UFO in- vestigators and researchers in Brazil who so generously helped us. In particular, we want to thank Jean Alencar, Reginaldo de Athayde, Marcos Arsenio and Thynan Salmeito de Melo ofFortaleza, Ceara; Elianildo da Silva Nascimento, Ricardo Lima e Silva, Alberto Rodrigues de Quieira, Manoel de Freitas, Lourinaldo Souza Queiroz, Ronaldo Rodrigues de Farias, Romero Chaves, Marcio Miranda Furtado and Pablo Ramires Sales Nascimento of Campina Grande, Paraiba; Jackson Felix Pereira of Sao Jose do Compestre Rio Grande do Norte; Irene Granchi in Rio de Janeiro; and Hulvio Brant Aleixo, Vitorio Pacaccini and Alberto do Carmo of Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais. Dr. Auxiliadora da Silva Maia of Apodi, Jose Humberto dos Santos of Santo Antonio and Jose Marcelo Pereira of Santa Cruz, all in the state of Rio Grande do Norte, were also extremely helpful in our UFO research. AN OPEN LETTER TO UROLOGISTS From Bob Bletchman MUFON Public Relations Director The breakthrough is near! It's coming! Any day now, the Government will be forced to admit that E.T. is here! Come all ye ufologically faithful! Gather round the official word and rejoice! Maybe this is the year. Or maybe next? Or maybe this decade, but then again '... ? In his new book, Angels and Aliens: UFOs and the Mythic Imagination, author Keith Thompson discovered that ufology's faith in the imminence of an official governmental disclosure has run unabated since Kenneth Arnold's sighting. But, as Thompson concedes, maybe this year they're right. But then again ... ? Well, we can wait for the landing on the White House lawn or our government to trust us with what it has learned. Or perhaps ufologists can be instrumental in setting the agenda. Any UFO case could serve as the catalyst. The recent book, The Gulf Breeze Sightings (which photographically chronicles a series of extraordinary multiple witness sightings), seemed to come tantalizingly close. Tabloid TV, including NBC's \"Unsolved Mysteries,\" and ABC-TV special, \"America's Best Kept Secrets,\" etc, all covered the case. But without any in- depth establishment media attention, neither the general public nor government officials appeared to be much concerned. What would have happened if the book had become a best seller? Which takes me to the point of this letter. A book, to acheive best seller status must have momen- tum going for it. Soon after publication a book is either on its way, or never will be. The film industry's massive com- mitment to advance promotional advertising attests to the same premise: Win early or not at all! A new book on the horizon, working title Cosmic Collision: The U.S. Military Retrieval & Coverup of a UFO, by Stanton T. Friedman and Don Berliner (Paragon 1992) might just do it. It's on the 1947 New Mexico crashes. Two previous Roswell books missed the mark for different reasons. The Roswell Incident, published in hardcover, diluted the important crash/retrieval text with extraneous speculative astronaut material provided by Berlitz. UFO Crash at Roswell was published in paperback. Paperbacks don't command at- tention for starters, and the UFO subject itself has been anathema to the establishment. When the establishment media pays attention, things can change. Witness former N.S.C. of- ficial Gary Sick's NY Times Op-ed piece (April 1991) which has directly led to the opening of a Congressional investiga- tion into the so-called October Surprise. What might similar attention to Cosmic Collision afford? This time, maybe the UFO community could pull together. Maybe this time we can allow that even if all the T's and I's are not correctly crossed or dotted, their basic crash/retrieval cover-up story is the best documented and most profound of any UFO case. The general public, though convinced of UFO reality, is conflicted regarding its nature. When ufologists, (Continued on page 14) MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 285 January 1992"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"PEEKING UNDER THE COVERATURE By Bob Oechsler Bob Oechsler responds to the critical review of Alien Liaison: The Ultimate Secret, Timothy Good's latest UFO report, offered by Jerold Ron Johnson in the Mufon UFO Journal Number 279, July 1991. One thing is for certain: J.R. Johnson did not read the same Alien Liaison that I read. In feet, it occurred to me that perhaps P. KJass had slipped in a sneak attack on the editors of the Mufon UFO Journal. After all, no one by the name of Johnson bothered to even give me a call or drop me a line just to see if Timothy Good had quoted me accurately. Another ques- tion that has troubled me since reading Johnson's review is simply: Did anyone at the Mufon UFO Journal make an ef- fort to read Alien Liaison before publishing Johnson's review? Perhaps MUFON management has been too busy trying to figure out why the IRS does not recognize the Texas Cor- poration as \"non-profit\"! Walt Andrus sent me a post-a-note with a copy of the July Journal asking if I could document any of the claims in Alien Liaison. As a matter of fact, I can document far more than what could feasibly be included in the Mufon UFO Journal. In fact, I doubt that Timothy Good's publisher would have proceeded without such documentation. Nonetheless, and in the interests of the efforts of Mr. Johnson, I will attempt to provide a well documented glimpse of some of the more per- tinent revelations. Not that it should be a terribly important issue, but in spite of Johnson's failings, I did in fact work for NASA at the God- dard Space Flight Center during the mid-Seventies. Although I had a bit more hair at the time, as depicted in the photographic identification card supplied, I still have access to the facilities at Goddard, where I conducted five months of analysis on the December 1987 video taken by Ed Walters in Gulf Breeze, Florida. In the technical aspects of my former work at NASA we were referred to as either Operations Specialists or Mission Specialists. I worked mainly with Technical Mission Directives and was referred to as a Mis- sion Specialist. We had no contact with the Astronaut Corps except through communications monitoring during missions. I was pretty much unaware of the UFO phenomenon during my tenure at NASA and thus consider my employment there as irrelevent to the issue. Johnson claims that I \"doggedly pursued retired Admiral Bobby Ray Inman ... for some years ... hoping to get the Admiral to reveal an association with the 'MAJESTIC TWELVE' group.\" Johnson reveals his limited exposure by suggesting that my assertions are only connections between Inman and UFOs to his knowledge. My interest in researching Admiral Inman did not arise until after I first met him in per- son while on assignment in May of 1988. The reason for in- troducing myself and asking about MJ-12 was as a direct result of my reading the report published by John Lear in 1987, in which Inman was named as a possible current member of MJ-12. (So much for Johnson's limited knowledge.) It was the lack of surprise in Inman's acknowledgement without ques- tion that got me curious about him. Still, it was 14 months before I contacted him again and that was at the request of Timothy Good who was visiting in the United States for the Ozark UFO Conference. That is hardly defined as dogged pursuit in my estimation. Following the incredible revelations in Inman's return telephone call, I still waited for about two years before permitting the contents of the conversation and identity of the caller to be published. After all, the Admiral was kind enough to provide me with some guidance in pur- suit of my prime objective, which was to obtain access to a recovered craft for civilian research, and it seemed more per- tinent to follow through on the leads he provided. The rela- tionship cooled after I invited him to give a keynote address at the Ozark Conference the next year. Since Johnson questions my \"convoluted\" (intricately com- plicated) questioning style, it seems relevant to reflect on my thoughts during the conversation with Inman. The last thing that I wanted to do was make use of inaccurate phraseology and scare the Admiral off, thinking I was some sort of kook. Aliens and ETs and UFOs were off-limits in this vocabulary. For all I knew, if the government did possess nonhuman-made craft, they certainly weren't unidentified. I chose to use terms such as crafts, phenomenon and recovered vehicles, along with phrases such as the 'intelligence behind the crafts.' I at- tempted to appeal to his technological interests in a sort of respectful form of comraderie. I asked for guidance. I got more than I expected. INMAN TRANSCRIPT The following is a transcript of a telephone conversation that took place at 8:00 a.m. EDT on July 20, 1989 between Bob Oechsler and Admiral Bobby Ray Inman. The Admiral was returning a call from the previous Friday made from the home of Bob Oechsler and in the company of Mr. Timothy Good. Tom King accepted the call on behalf of the Admiral as his executive assistant, indicating that the Admiral was on the West Coast and was expected to return on Tuesday, whereupon he would have the Admiral return the call. Bob answered the call on his kitchen phone, saying \"This is Bob Oechsler.\" The caller followed with the acknowledgement \"This is Bob Inman.\" Following a brief greeting, Bob asked to be excused to go to his desk to fetch his notes, and of course flip on his tape recording machine, which had become a MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 285 January 1992"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"matter of common procedure during his research for note- taking purposes. He presumed that the Admiral was unaware of the tape recording of the conversation. Oechsler: Yes, Thank you very much for returning my call. Inman: You're most welcome. Oechsler: Do you remember who I am? Inman: Unfortunately I do not, I apologize. Oechsler: OK, well we met at the University of Science, University of Maryland Science and Technology ... Inman: I do pull out, now, thank you. *** This sudden abrupt recollection is important because it indicates that the Admiral did in fact consider our brief meeting in May of 1988 to be worthy of recollection. It was during that encounter that I asked if he would be good enough to have someone get in touch with me relative to how I could get close to MJ-12, again indicating that MJ-12 meant something to him. If MJ-12 represents anything relative to the UFO phenomenon, then the Admiral is clearly aware of the subject matter pending in this conversation, and of which he was advised by Tom King from my prior call involved a sub- ject matter classified at least SCI (Sensitive Compartmentaliz- ed Information). Oechsler: I wanted to, for one thing, on behalf of myself I was looking for some guidance that I hoped you might be able to afford me ... Inman: OK. Oechsler: ... in giving me some kind of direction in how I can assist in this project. I've been spending a great deal of time researching the phenomenon and technologically I think I might have some very interesting things to offer ... Inman: Uh huh. Oechsler: ... Probably not nearly as much as it was, what you probably already know. But I certainly would like to get some guidance in a number of different areas. It's probably a situation where I would like to at some point get together with you, and get an overview of what direction I might take in which I might be able to help in. On behalf of Admiral Lord Hill-Norton and Mr. Good, the best I can do there is I have no idea what the level of security crossing countries happens to be. And I really don't want to get too much in- volved in that end of it, I'll leave that to your discretion. Inman: What is Peter Hill-Norton doing now? Oechsler: What is he doing right now? Inman: Yeah. *** Obviously I was unprepared for this question and had no idea what Admiral Lord Hill-Norton's first name was nor what activities in which he was currently engaged. Oechsler: As far as I know he is working in the background of things. He has worked extensively with Timothy Good in a publication he has put out, Above Top Secret, which you may or may not be aware of, out by William Morrow out of New York. Inman: I am not, aware of it. Oechsler: OK, in any case he is working, they are more or less working together, Timothy Good as a consultant. Ad- miral Lord Hill-Norton is, as the way he's expressed it to me, quite furious with his inability to gain knowledge on the issues. Inman: (Muffled acknowledgement) *** Important to note that it appears that Admiral Inman with his muffled acknowledgement appears to understand the dilem- ma here and recognized the inferred subject matter. Oechsler: And he in fact sent Timothy Good here on a tour hoping to find out more information. There was a conference in Las Vegas at the end of June (and) the first couple days of July, where he had hoped to pick up some contact infor- mation. And I had suggested to him that the only individual I knew that possibly would be able to help him, if it was in- deed possible to gain any information across country boun- daries would be through you. And I suggested that that con- tact be made. Inman: What is the general area of interest? *** Perhaps the first clue that the Admiral wants confirma- tion of the issues, or perhaps wants to narrow the scope of the inquiry. Oechsler: Two things, one, it's my feeling from my research that there is a dichotomy of sorts, one in which there seems to be an indoctrination program to educate the public to the realities that are involved here. The other must be a problem relating to security measures and the need to know level. I have the ability to control the influence and understanding and acceptability of a great, great mass of the public. I have a nation-wide radio broadcast, regular radio broadcast on the subject matter. I'm well written amongst all of the publica- tions. I am connected with all the major organizations. I've investigated, I spent 18 months investigating, including field investigations involving the Gulf Breeze situation. I know all the internals on that. And I have focused a great deal on the technological end of the technologies, and I've studied a great deal of the things that have been going wrong along in the Chesapeake Bay, in connection with the Electromagnetic Con- tinuity Analysis Center and with the EMP projects. *** Four Important points here.

Inman: All of those are areas in which I am vastly out of date. When I made the decision to retire seven years ago, I made a conscious decision to sever ongoing ties with the U.S. Intelligence Community. I have had some exposure on limited occassions, to some areas of activity over the succeeding seven years when I did the Embassy Security Survey as a consul- tant to the Defense Science Board. But overwhelmingly my efforts in these seven years have been focused on industrial competitiveness ... Oechsler: Right. Inman: ... on the application of science and technology in the commercial world. Oechsler: I am aware of that. Inman: So for many of the things, at least as I sort of infer from the conversation of the interest of Mr. Good and Peter Hill-Norton, they are areas where while I had some exper- tise, it's now, you know, seven years old. *** The Admiral seems to confirm here that the areas he in- fers from the conversation are areas where he at some point had some expertise which he later narrows to a period be- tween 1979 and 1982, when he knew and worked with the Deputy Director of Science and Technology at CIA. He served as NSA director from 1977-1981 and Deputy Director of the CIA from 1981 until he retired in 1982. Oechsler: I see. Inman: And the pace at which things move in that field, the odds of my being accurate are increasingly remote, in understanding those things. *** Again, to recognize the pace at which things move in that field suggests he has no reservations about the subject mat- ter which we are discussing. Oechsler: Is it your understanding that there is a cultural dialogue going on, (long pause) today? Inman: Well I guess I'd have to ask with whom? Between what parties? (Note: Smile can be heard on the tape.) Oechsler: Well, between any of the parties that presumably are behind the technology in the crafts. Inman: I honestly don't know. Have no exposure at all. So I haven't a clue whether there are any ongoing dialogues or not. I'm trying to think who there in the Washington area that is at least much closer to the issues, that might be able to at least give you some guidance. *** His immediate response without pause indicates no con- fusion in the use of the term crafts and suggests again an understanding. His later commentary regarding \"whether time is evolved... they are beginning to become more open to it'' suggests that he understands who is behind the technology in the crafts. Oechsler: That's what I am looking for. I'm not looking to step on any toes. I think I have some things to offer and I would like to participate. And to be frank with you, you are essentially the only one I would feel safe in getting guidance from at this point ... Inman: Uh huh. Oechsler: ... Based on the more I know, ...\" Inman: Yeah Oechsler: ... the more concerned I become with how I should handle what I know. Inman: The Deputy Director for Science and Technology at CIA is named Everett Hineman. He is in fact getting ready to retire in the very near future. That may make him somewhat more willing to have dialogues than he otherwise would have had. When I knew him in the period seven to ten years ago, he was a person of very substantial integrity and just good common sense. So as a place to start he would clearly be high on the list. In the retired community of those who nonetheless were exposed to the intelligence business and stayed reasonably close to it, there is a retired Rear Admiral, a former director of Naval Intelligence, named Sumner Shapiro, who has been a Vice President of BDM. I think he just retired. *** The commentary regarding Hineman suggests that some- one may be willing to publicize the activities which we are discussing. It seems pertinent to reiterate that the Admiral knows he is speaking with a journalist. Oechsler: VDM? Inman: BDM. It's a corporation there in the McLean area. His level of competence again is very high, his integrity is very high. Whether he has any knowledge in the areas you are working on I don't have a clue, because I don't have any ongoing dialogue with him. But those are at least two thoughts for you that are there in the area where you are located. And who have a prospect of still having some currency. I don't know that they do. In my case I don't have any. *** The BDM Corporation was behind the Harrison Schmidt Conference on Cattle Mutilations in 1979. Oechsler: Do you anticipate that any of the recovered vehicles would ever become available for technological research? Out- side of the military circles. Inman: Again, I honestly don't know. Ten years ago the answer would have been no. Whether as time has evolved they are beginning to become more open on it there's a possibili- ty. Again, Mr. Hineman probably would be the best person to put that kind of question to. *** Recovered vehicles, previously referred to as crafts, and researching the phenomenon ten years ago had to have ex- isted in order to have been denied access.

July 20, 1989 T his conversation was followed by a meeting with Everett Hineman at CIA Headquarters on August 10, 1989 which lasted for forty five minutes in which we discussed several proposals, all related to the UFO phenomenon. A follow-up telephone conversation on September 1, 1989 with Hineman revealed that he had ac- cess to some people who were familiar with the Bob Lazar case in Las Vegas, Nevada. Subsequent correspondence with the Admiral revealed by tape message answering device that the Admiral regarded the material subject matter as being covered under \"National Secrecy Laws\" and asked that his name not be used without his permission in regard to these matters. The latter in direct reference to a letter to the Admiral dated March 29, 1990 and so referenced on the tape. In a letter dated August 5, 1991 written in response to a British Researcher's inquiry, Admiral Inman stated \"Having no prior knowledge of Mr. Oechlers (sic) interest, I did not understand until well into his dialogue that his research was about Unidentified Flying Objects.\" That hardly seems like the \"underwater vehicles\" reported in Johnson's review. Perhaps Johnson got his notes mixed up since he only took notes and did not have the luxury of reviewing his interview with Inman from a tape recording. Or maybe the Admiral lied to Johnson. That's not as impossible as one might think. The Admiral indicated through his executive assistant by voice message on my answering machine that these issues were covered under National Secrecy Laws which I presume could compel one to mislead in any manner necessary. We must not forget that when Johnson spoke with Inman and Shapiro, et.al. he made it clear that he was going to publish a review. When I spoke with these people, the issue was guidance and not publication. In order to set matters straight for the record and to re- spond to those who have seen fit to dismiss \"anything Bob Oechsler says,\" I arranged to have Dr. Bruce Maccabee review all of the evidence, including signatures and recordings re- garding the revelations of Admiral Inman, that the U.S. Government does in fact have possession of non-human manufactured crafts. Through an Officially Signed Statement, Maccabee confirms that these revelations were in fact made and that Inman provided me with additional contacts who might be able to provide guidance in gaining access to such craft or vehicles. The confirmed revelations of Admiral Inman that the U.S. government possesses UFO technology may shed some light on another issue of controversy, that of Bob Lazar who has provided some evidence that he may have worked on such craft. When I last spoke with Everett Hineman, my impres- sion was that the Bob Lazar claims may indeed be valid, if not misinterpreted by ufologists. Whatever manipulation might be involved with the Bob Lazar scenario, we should all con- sider the enclosed letter written to Mr. Klass (Name and ad- dress blocked out) on Department of the Air Force stationery, Office of the Secretary. My research indicated that the signatory, Thomas Shively Maj. USAF, is not on record with the Air Force and is probably a pseudonym. As for the many other questioned claims, misquoted references and page numbers, as well as the extremely inac- curate, slanted and shameful distortions of Cosmic Journey and Alien Liaison in general, I can only feel disgust for the manner in which as ufologists we present ourselves through the pages-of this journal. If we can't even recognize that we are dealing with a coverup, how can we expect to learn anything about our objectives. Did Johnson really expect to confirm any of these issues by using the Klassic method of investigation? If he really wanted to prove the issues in Alien Liaison, he should have at least gone to the original source, after all, I wasn't the author but I sure could have given him some ammunition and maybe even some needed guidance. As a final note for those who are interested, several re- searchers have contributed greatly to the validation of the microgravity chamber that I visited outside the Houston area. Lucius Parish was told by a reliable individual about such microgravity projects over ten years ago. And Ron Madeley of Houston is working with an individual who has an exten- sive background in the development of a facility such as the one I visited. Details of the latter to be published soon by Len Stringfield. For those such as Melaine King, who were unjustly discredited by J.R. Johnson, please accept my apologies for the total misrepresentation of the facts. For those of you who have not yet done so, I encourage you to read Alien Liaison. For J.R. Johnson I hope he finds a new pair of glasses and re-reads this classic work by Timothy Good. \"KLASS\"LETTER The following letter accompanied Mr. Oechsler's remarks. It was received anonymously in the mail, and Mr. Oechsler believes it was addressed to Philip Klass. It is dated December 19, 1990, and appears on a simple Department of the Air Force letterhead with a seal from the Office of Secretary in the up- per left hand corner.

Maccabee, Ph.D. \"Having reviewed a conversation and verbatim transcript (the former of which was recorded for notational purposes on July 20, 1989), I can verify the following as a true and correct representation. The tape recording is an accurate repre- sentation of a conversation where Mr. Oechsler is seeking guidance in getting access to a recovered vehicle or craft. B. R. Inman indirectly acknowledges U.S. Government possession of such craft and provides the names of individuals for Mr. Oechsler to contact who might be able to provide additional guidance in gaining access to such craft or vehicles. \"I have also reviewed a series of correspondence bearing the signature of B.

AND A FEW EDITORIAL NOTES The opinions expressed above are of course those of Mr. Oechsler and associates, just as the ones to follow are those of the Journal editor. To address each and every issue under discussion would require an article of equal length. Since I'm also presently working on an article about the same subject for Omni Magazine, I am somewhat limited in what I can say here. Briefly, however, in answer to Mr. Oechsler's first para- graph, yes, someone at the Journal read Timothy Good's Alien Liaison, or at least the concluding \"Cosmic Journey\" chapter which was the primary focus of Mr. Johnson's review (See \"The UFO Press,\" No. 279, July 1991, pp. 13-16.). In the same paragraph Mr. Oechsler wonders why the reviewer failed to contact him to see if Mr. Good had pro- perly quoted him, and then goes on to muse about MUFON's tax-exempt status, as if the two had anything to do with one another. For the record, we wondered, too, why MUFON didn't show up on the State Comptroller's list of non-profit organizations. And we did just what Mr. Oechsler recom- mended: Walt Andrus put in a call, once we were aware of the omission. Would you believe computer error? The Comp- troller assures us that MUFON will show up on its next of- ficial listing. In the meantime, we'd like to know why Mr. Oechsler didn't call the Comptroller himself and confirm the error, rather than raising such a trivial side-issue in a suspicious light? Or perhaps MUFON is supposed to be a part of the conspiratorial cover-up as well? More importantly, was Mr. Oechsler misquoted in Alien Liaisons or not? If so, he certainly doesn't offer any correc- tions in his refutation of Mr. Johnson's review. In subsequent conversations, Mr. Oechsler has suggested that he was \"mis- quoted\" to the extent that Mr. Good made the Cosmic Journey project appear somewhat less commercial and more government-connected than it actually was. While we are happy to have the transcript of his conversa- tion with (Retired) Admiral Bobby Ray Inman for the record, we must also point out that it was illegally recorded without the Admiral's knowledge or permission, and that MUFON in no way recommends or supports such activities. Interesting as it is, however, we also feel that it is open to a number MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 285 January 1992"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"of subjective interpretations, including the one put forth by Admiral Inman himself that he had no idea what Mr. Oechsler was talking about or trying to get at. Certainly UFOs themselves are never mentioned by name. Mr. Oechsler explains this lack of precise technology by saying that he wanted to appeal to the Admiral's technological in- terests and didn't want to be perceived as a kook. Fine and well, but one still wonders why the references are so obscure as to be almost meaningless? Why are words like aliens, ET and UFOs off-limits in this regard, if he has already been invited, or at least admitted, into MJ-12's 'inner sanctum' as Mr. Oechsler seems to imply? For that matter, if MJ-12 were as tight-fisted, security wise, as its proponents charge, why would Admiral Inman \"spill the beans,\" so to speak, without saying something like, \"uh, OK, what was your name again?\" and \"thanks, I'll get back to you later,\" allowing him time to make a security check and confirm that Mr. Oechsler was indeed who he said he was? There are also some inconsistencies in Mr. Oechsler's own interpretations of why Admiral Inman would say what and when and to whom. For example, when Inman denied know- ing what he (Oechsler) was talking about when called by Mr. Johnson, Mr. Oechsler attributes this statement to Inrnan's knowledge that he was talking to a journalist (Johnson). \"When I spoke with these people (Inman, et al),\" says Oechsler, \"the issue was guidance and not publication.\" Yet earlier, when reading Admiral Inman's mind, Mr. Oechsler says \"it seems pertinent to reiterate that the Admiral knows he is speaking with a journalist,\" i.e., Oechlser himself. At the very least, then, Mr. Oechsler has presented himself as a journalist seeking guidance, by his own admission. Presumably, Mr. Johnson's conversation with Admiral Inman can be seen in the same light, except that he was asking for guidance about Mr. Oechsler's interpretation of events. Needless to say, the subjective interpretations of each and every word in the Inman transcript could go on forever without two individual interpreters ever agreeing to agree on what was really meant. In fact, Mr. Oechsler's own interpretation that the Inman conversation took place in the context of UFOs is based on the meaning of a single word used in a letter In- man wrote English researcher Dr. Armen Victorian. That sentence, with the relevant word in italics, reads as follows: \"Having no prior knowledge of Mr. Oechsler's interest, I did not understand until well into his dialogue that his research was about Unidentified Flying Objects.\" Both Dr. Maccabee and Mr. Oechsler view this as an open admission on Admiral Inman's part that the subject was indeed UFOs and Inman knew as much. But Dr. Victorian, arguably, had already supplied the UFO context in his original letter of inquiry. Admiral Inman now claims that he first learned the subject was UFOs when Rear Admiral Sumner Shapiro (one of the people he mentioned to Oechsler) called him, after his own interview or confron- tation with Mr. Oechsler, and asked, in effect, \"Who was that?\" Also interesting are the two sentences that sandwich the one quoted above. The preceding sentence from Admiral In- man's letter to Dr. Victorian for example, reads as follows: \"I have never heard of any organization called MJ12 nor did I have any understanding from Mr. Oechsler about his seek- ing information on a specific organization. His use of Ad- miral Lord Peter Hill-Norton's name was the principal fac- tor in my having a conversation at all with Mr. Oechsler.\" The following sentence is: \"Throughout 22 years of ser- vice in the intelligence community, I never encountered any credible evidence of the existence of extraterrestrial or in- terplanetary entities, individuals, crafts, vehicles or persons. I do not believe any credible evidence of such activity exists.\" Was his use of the word \"dialogue\" a Freudian slip on the part of Admiral Inman or not? He claims that \"dialogue\" refers not to just his own conversation with Mr. Oechsler, but to the totality of talks carried out over time with the people he had mentioned to Mr. Oechsler. Again, it seems, one could quibble about these \"occult,\" or hidden, meanings endlessly without ever reaching a con- sensus. One simply pays one's money and takes one's choice, probably depending on prior perceptions of UFOs and the government's involvement. B ut this is hardly the only, or even the main, issue raised by Mr. Johnson in his review. Most, in fact, have to do with Mr. Oechsler's own claimed \"Cosmic Journey,\" during the course of which he not only visited an alleged microgravity chamber outside Houston and offshore NORAD platform in the Gulf of Mexico, but apparently traveled between the two in a supersonic-speed \"silent\" helicopter. One hates to be seen as siding with the skeptics in this par- ticular case, but Mr. Oechsler really has made some extra- ordinary first-person claims in Alien Liaison, and basic com- mon sense dictates that at least some ordinary proof be sup- plied to substantiate same. Gravity, for instance, is treated as if it were nothing more complex or involved than tap water, something that can be turned on and off at will, rather than a condition, or consequence, of matter itself. Presumably, this is possible as a result of technology acquired from recovered ASCs, or \"Alternative Spacecraft.\" Yet the only outside proof Mr. Oechsler provides for such an anti-gravity chamber other than his own statements, are the following comments: \"Lucius Parish was told by a reliable individual about such microgravity projects over ten years ago. And Ron Madeley of Houston is working with an individual who has an extensive background in the development of a facility such as the one I visited. Details of the latter to be published soon by Leonard Stringfield.\" Apologies to those gentleman mentioned above, but this hardly constitutes the ability to overcome gravity at will and whim, whether based on earthbound or extraterrestrial technology. Mr. Oechsler has upped the UFO ante con- siderably with his \"Cosmic Journey\" revelations, and it seems only fair that the burden of proof, ordinary or extraordinary, should rest on his shoulders. Whatever Admiral Inman meant MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 285 January 1992"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"or didn't in his taped conversation, none of it can be inter- preted as supporting the notion or existence of an anti-gravity chamber outside Houston, etc. Finally, there is the matter of the \"Klass\" letter. Some peo- ple attach more meaning and significance to anonymous evidence received in the mail than does this reader. Everyone is welcome to their own opinion, but it strikes me as just as a little \"too good to be true,\" without additional data to sup- port its authenticity. It not only \"demonizes\" Mr. Klass, but manages to touch all the seemingly meaningful and current UFO bases in the meantime. Or perhaps its true \"target\" is Mr. Cooper? Who can say? What can be said is that it could be fairly easily hoaxed by anyone with a typewriter (or a computer and laser printer) and the time and inclination, for reasons of their own, to do so. It seems a little too neatly \"conspiratorial\" to me, like a wink, wink and a nudge, nudge out of a Monty Python skit. It also seems just a little too clever, like a letter designed to set up, say, the Pope by telling a story about finding a woman in his sleeping quarters, and then signing off with \"Oh, by the way, Merry Christmas!\" Is this, one wonders, how the Grand Air Force UFO Cover-up Conspiracy really works? If so, why use a pseudonym? We do agree on one thing with Mr. Oechsler, however: Everyone should read Alien Liaison and decide for themselves the overall plausibility (and gravity) of his and Mr. Good's claims. — Dennis Stacy The Ultimate Secret OPEN LETTER, Continued ostensibly speaking for our discipline, angrily denounce one another's position, the poor timorous public throws up their hands and walks away from the case.

LETTERS Dear Editor: The editorial in the November Journal was refreshing. I wholeheartedly agree that any forum seeking to maintain credibility cannot lend itself to personality confrontations, per- sonal beliefs or the distortion of facts due to either of these two pervasive problems. You are 100 percent correct in insisting that \"we follow the facts wherever they lead.\" To me this means don't form an opinion yet, keep an open mind and, most importantly, continue gathering the facts. In our desire and desperation to finally discover the truth about UFOs, we tend to form premature opinions. We should not do this. If we continue on this course we leave ourselves vulnerable to all sorts of manipulation, particularly disinformation. If MUFON needs a motto, it should be: \"Stick to the facts, please (and if they aren't facts, then we don't want to hear about them).\" This is more of a necessity than ever before, given the ever-changing and complicated world in which we live. Again, thank you for an excellent editorial, which I fully appreciate and support. — Alexa Cameron Clinton, MD Letters of comment should be neatly typed and doublespaced.

(See our article, \"Brazil Still UFO Hot Spot,\" elsewhere in this issue.) On the map, Paraiba looks like an undulating amoeba-like mass that runs east to west. It is about 285 miles from the coast to the westernmost part of the state and 35 to 70 miles deep north to south. In 1990, the members of ICU initiated Project Sonde to canvas the entire state, starting in Campina Grande and work- ing their way out in all directions. They have marked a map with concentric circles every 20 kilometers out from the center of Campina Grande. The aim is to visit two or three houses in every block of every street of every municipality within each circle, as well as the rural areas, to find out whether any occupants, friends, neighbors or acquaintances have had any UFO experiences. At the same time, they are attempting to build a network of informants who will notify them of any new sightings. Once every community within 20 kilometers of Campina Grande has been surveyed, the group will then begin work- ing in communities located 20 to 40 kilometers out of Cam- pina Grande, and continue moving further out until the en- tire state has been covered. Since they began in 1990, they have surveyed ten municipalities and have found at least one sighting or en- counter in each town or village. Ricardo Lima e Silva, director of Project Sonde, estimates it will take at least eight years to complete the job. Ricardo, an electronic engineering stu- dent, trained all the other field investigators. Ricardo, Elianildo and seven other members of ICU spent the weekend of September 6-8 showing us the area and tak- ing us to witnesses in three of their cases. One case involved a 41-year-old teacher who was escort- ing nine children ages 8 to 12 home from school one night in 1982. (In much of Brazil, especially in farm areas, children work during the day and go to school at night.) A yellowish- red light about half a meter wide and with a big black round form behind it came toward them. It moved fast and soon passed slowly 10 to 15 meters above their heads and lighting up the whole area. It then circled the group, all now very afraid, and slowly went away. The second case involved a farmer who was walking home from work just before midnight one night in 1971. He stopped to relieve himself and a big ball of light suddenly appeared nearby. He ran and it chased him for about 125 MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 285 January 1992"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"meters. He then had to run across the top of a 150-meter- long dam with a guard rail on only one side. As he did, the object passed close overhead before going away. The third case occurred in daylight on a morning in 1964 when a woman, then 22, was washing clothes in a pond on a farm. She heard a noise coming toward her, looked up and saw a disc-shaped object. She became frightened and hid in the bushes. The object landed, a ramp came down and two small, \"very ugly\" creatures got out. They spent about half an hour gathering soil and plant samples. They then re-entered the object. It spun around several times and left with a whir- ring noise.

A fter studying \"Crop Circles\" since 1985 and collecting and analysing plant stems from incidents up to 150 miles apart, traces of High Frequency Radiation believed to be in the low GHZ waveband have now been identified in the plant samples. During a seven year period of investigating Crop Circles and Pictograms, one common denominator emerged. This was the discovery of single standing stems, with top sections bent over at a height of 55cm (22\") in an otherwise flattened circle of wheat and barley. It has also been discovered that, the single stems, apart from being bent at 55cm, show a number of other common features. These are small \"crease\" and burn marks at similar points on the crop stems. It is believed that the 55cm stem measurement is indicative of a H/F wavelength in the lower GHZ order. The \"crease\" marks and small burnt areas on the stems could be consis- tent with microwave action during the formation of a crop circle. It is common knowledge that microwaves in the low GHZ frequency can be beamed thousands of miles to within an ac- curacy of only a few millimeters. They can also be pro- grammed to transmit a \"footprint\" of almost any required pattern to its destination. By these means, a microwave beam programmed with either a Pictogram of Circular pattern could be directed to the target area. This theory does not pertain to the reason behind the for- mation of crop circles, only as to the possible means. It could however, answer a number of questions that have been puzzl- ing researchers for some time: (1) What force, normally invisible, is capable of such ac- tion within such a short duration of time (possibly 20 seconds)? (2) What can account for the \"Plasma Balls\" photographed by Japanese and British scientists over the wheatfields in England, where crop circles have later been discovered? (3) How can crop circles occur either during the day or night, and with or without any wind, for instance in a mist at night? e.g. Wiltshire, July 1991. (4) What could account for a \"mist\" often seen shortly after the formation of a crop circle? If a microwave beam is responsible for the formation of crop circles, the outstanding question must be, who or what is sending it and for what purpose? — Omar Fowler Ilkeston, Derbys, England IN OTHERS' WORDS/Lucius Parish W hat is it really like to be a UFO researcher? \"Costly and stressful,\" say some of those involved in this pur- suit.

The December 1991 cover story in Popular Mechanics is entitled \"Top Secret: Reshaping the Look of America's Air Power\" (pp. 32-35, 109). By Gregory T. Pope, it is essen- tially a reprise of an article which appeared in Aviation Week & Space Technology in October of the previous year, along with a lot of interesting (and hypothetical) color and line art by Mark McCandish and a few additional eyewitness accounts. Thanks to Steve Lewis of San Antonio for bring- ing it to my attention. \"Top Secret\" deals with nocturnal aircraft activity in the vicinity of California's Antelope Valley, home to Edwards AFB and Air Force Plant #42, and not far from the test- flight paths of nearby China Lake Naval Weapons Center and Nellis Air Range, just over the state line in Nevada. The latter, of course, is near Groom Lake, site of S-4 and Area 51, the much-rumored \"Dreamland,\" where recovered, captured or bartered-for UFOs are supposedly studied and/or test flown by U.S. military personnel in an ongoing covert program aimed at unlocking the secrets of extraterrestrial technology. In general, three basic types of aerial devices are reported, all roughly triangular in configuration. The first appears to have a wingspan somewhere between 60 and 160 feet across; the second \"black budget\" device is seen only as a high- flying orange or yellow light accompanied by a loud, puls- ing roar; while the third phantom device is described as a black boomerang, a staggering 600 to 800 feet from wingtip to wingtip, reportedly capable of surprising acrobatics at airspeeds of less than 50 m.p.h. T he smaller of these triangular phantoms may be the reputed TR-3A from Northrop, a super-sophisticated tactical reconnaisance platform that appears to work in tandem with the F-117A stealth fighter, and which may have even been operational during the recent Gulf War. Best guesstimates (see illustration above) put the TR-3A's dimen- sions at 42 feet long by 60-65 feet wide. A slightly larger craft with an approximate wingspan of some 150 feet has also been reported. The high-altitude \"pulse-jet\" may be the so-called \"Aurora,\" an experimental proto-type which achieves high-speed flight via an external combustion engine. Ejected fuel combustion actually takes place outside the air- craft, in a cone formed by the supersonic shock wave boun- dary and part of the aeroform's trailing fuselage. Even less is known about the third, giant triangular platform, except that it seems to be capable of extremely unusual aerial manuevers. For related information, see the November 18, 1991 issue of U.S. News & World Report, with its specula- tions about the performance of the Stealth fighter during Operation Desert Storm. (\"The Myth of the Lone Gun- slinger,\" p. 52.) All this hardware comes at considerable cost. According to Popular Mechanics, quoting figures obtained from the Northrop's TR-3A according to Popular Mechanics Defense Budget Project, a non-profit Washington, D.C., organization, the Air Force alone budgeted some $46 billion over the last five years on classified weapons projects, along with another $20 billion in classified research and develop- ment. Not exactly small change by anyone's standards. And remember, that's only the Air Force side of our black ar- mory's ledger. What does all this have to do with UFOs? Some of ufology's more conspiracy-oriented researchers have long argued that much of our own hi-tech, space age technology stems, in fact, from \"captured\" flying saucers. Such a scenario, however, begs more questions than it answers. One of the more obvious examples of alien technology, for ex- ample, is supposed to be the ability of some aircraft to avoid detection by radar — the so-called Stealth technology. Yet at one time, radar returns of some UFOs were thought to be conclusive physical proof of the existence of solid, ex- traterrestrial UFOs. Most recently, \"solid\" radar returns figured prominently in the Belgian flap. Similarly, many UFOs were said to be as silent as ghosts; in fact, it was their major characteristic at one time. Again, it's hard to reconcile the stealthy silence of the \"average\" UFO with the ear and sky-splitting, pulsed roar of the alleged Aurora aircraft. Perhaps the latest generation of Air Force superjets is somehow \"evidence\" of captured UFO technology. At the same time one has to wonder, if only hypothetically: what would we have achieved on our own, in the absence of UFOs? — Dennis Stacy MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 285 January 1992"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"Looking Back Bob Gribble January 1952 • On the night of the first, an orange-red disc appeared over North Bay, Ontario, Canada, where the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) had a new jet fighter base. For eight minutes, flying at a high altitude and supersonic speed, the craft circled, dived and zig-zagged over the field. When the report was published, RCAF Intelligence refused to comment. Then a second UFO was reported, again over North Bay. Approaching from the southwest, it stopped directly above the base. After hovering for a moment, it swiftly reversed direction. Climbing at an angle of 30-degrees, it disappeared at tremendous speed. Meantime, other disturbing reports had reached the RCAF. Until then, many top officers, taking their cue from the American Pentagon debunking, had laughed off the sightings. But after the second North Bay case, a high-level conference was held at Ottawa. Four days later RCAF Intelligence publicly admitted it was starting a serious in- vestigation. At the same time the Defense Research Board announced a new secret project. \"We are carefully studying the information,\" said Dr. O.M. Solandt, chairman of the Board. \"At the moment we are as mystified as anyone else.\" Another official statement was given out by Dr. J.C. Mackenzie, chairman of the Atomic Energy Control Board and formerly president of the National Research Council. \"It seemed fantastic that there could be any such thing,\" said Dr. Mackenzie. \"At first the temptation was to say it was all nonsense, a series of optical illusions. But there have been so many reports from responsible observers that they cannot be ignored. It seems hardly possible that all these reports could be due to optical illu- sions.\" Dr. Peter Millman, a famous Dominion astrophysicist, also admitted he was baffled after studying the sighting reports. \"It is no good just laughing at these reports. We can't discover any conventional explanation which would cover the reported maneuvers of these objects.\" (Flying Saucers From Outer Space, by Donald Keyhoe) H An Air Force spokesman, in a special news release, disclosed that ob- jects resembling \"flying discs\" were sighted over Korea by crew members of two U.S. bombers on the 29th. The spokesman indicated that several were sighted, but did not give the number. The first report reached Air Force in- telligence officers from two crew members of a B-29 Superfortress who said they saw the craft flying parallel to their plane about midnight. The air- craft was over Wonsan, Korea, at the time. This report might have been dis- counted as over-imaginative. But on the same night, a B-29 from a different squadron was returning to its base after a flight over Sunchon, a considerable distance from Wonsan. Two crew members told intelligence officers that they had seen \"flying discs\" moving parallel to their plane at a high altitude. They fixed the time at about midnight. \"The UFOs remained with the B-29 over Wonsan for five minutes and with the B-29 over Sunchon for one minute,\" the Air Force said. (The Mail Tribune, Medford, OR, 2/19/52) 1957 • On the 16th, retired Rear Ad- miral Delmer S. Fahrney, once head of the Navy's guided missile program, made the following statement at a news conference in Washington, D.C.: \"Reliable reports indicate that there are objects coming into our atmosphere at very high speeds. No agency in this country or Russia is able to duplicate at this time the speeds and accelerations which radars and observers indicate these flying objects are able to achieve. There are signs that an intelligence guides these objects because of the way they fly. The way they change position in formations and override each other would indicate that their motion is directed. The Air Force is collecting factual data on which to base an opi- nion, but time is required to sift and correlate the material...\" (Most of the major papers and wire services carried the above statement at the time.) • About a week later, another startl- ing announcement received national news coverage. Clyde W. Tombaugh, discoverer of the planet Pluto, said, \"Unidentified Flying Objects seen in recent years may be coming from out- side our own solar system.\" Tombaugh, research professor at New Mexico A. and M. College in Las Cruces, New Mexico, said there may be many worlds besides our own which could sustain life. \"When we consider the extreme- ly rapid tapping of new energies we have seen in the past ten years, we can imagine what a head start a race would have which passed our present point of progress a million years, or only a thou- sand years, before us.\" Tombaugh said that he has seen celestial phenomena which he could not explain, but that he takes neither the cynical nor the en- thusiastic view with regard to their nature or origin. \"These things, which do appear to be directed, are unlike any other phenomena I ever observed,\" Tombaugh declared. \"Their apparent lack of obedience to the ordinary laws of celestial motion gives credence.\" (A.P.R.G.

(UFO In- vestigator, Aug/Sept 1962) 1967 • Writing in the January- February edition of \"Midland Schools,\" official publication of the Iowa State Education Association, a university professor called on fellow educators to face the possibility that UFOs are real, and they will have to be explaining them in the classrooms. Dr. D.H. Bragg, associate professor of education at Drake University, said his purpose is \"to alert the teaching profession to the fact that there is a strong possibility that the UFO controversy is about to enter the classrooms as a social, scientific, and perhaps political and cultural prob- lem of major implications in our world.\" Bragg said some experts have presented \"what appears to be documentary and convincing evidence\" that UFOs are real. (The Post, Houston, TX, 1/22/67; Dr. Bragg is a MUFON Consultant and Assistant State Direc- tor for Iowa.) I Mysterious men dressed in Air Force uniforms or bearing impressive credentials from government agencies have been \"silencing\" UFO witnesses, according to Col. George Freeman, Pentagon spokesman for Project Bluebook. \"We have checked a number of these cases,\" Freeman said in an in- terview on the 25th, \"and these men are not connected with the Air Force in any way.\" He cited one case in which the police officers and other witnesses at UFO sightings in Wanaque, New Jersey, were collected together by a man wearing an Air Force uniform. They were told that they \"hadn't seen anything\" and that they shouldn't discuss the incident. \"We checked with the local Air Force Base,\" Freeman declared, \"and discovered that no one connected with the Air Force had visited Wanaque on the date in question.\" A man claiming to represent \"a government agency so secret that he couldn't give its name\" appeared in a school in Norwalk, Connecticut, and grilled two 12-year-old boys for two hours about the disc-shaped object which they said had pursued them at ground level in April 1966. \"We haven't been able to find out anything about these men,\" Freeman admitted. \"By posing as Air Force officers and government agents they are committing a federal offense. We would sure like to catch one. Unfortunately, the trail is always too cold by the time we hear about these cases. But we're still try- ing.\" (The Sentinel, Orlando, FL, 2/3/67; North American Newspaper Alliance teletype story) 1972 • Norman R. Chastain, 62, was out fishing in the Saint Johns River, near Jacksonville, Florida, on the 26th. At 3 a.m., he was sitting at anchor in a slack tide about 50 feet from shore when he noticed \"several orange and blue lights.\" At first he thought it was a mosquito control or police helicopter. He heard no sound. \"After a few minutes, the lights came directly towards my boat and I could make out the outline of something like a half of a ball with lights flashing and chang- ing colors about every minute,\" he said. He said the UFO was about 150 feet in the air directly over his boat. He snapped off the lights on his boat and the lights moved slowly away. His boat had run aground by this time and he went ashore. Chastain said he went looking for a lever to pry his boat free, found a piece of 2-by-6 wood and was carrying it back when he stopped to rest, 75 feet from his boat. \"I raised my spotlight to see if my boat was still in the muck and, in the edges of the bushes, I saw the darndest-looking human-like being one could every imagine.\" He said he dropped the timber and immediately was hit by a \"brilliant white light.\" It made him dizzy and he lay down on the grass. His arms and legs became numb and tingled, but he stayed on the ground, praying, until daybreak. He then crawled farther inland and stayed until about noon, when his strength returned. He swam out to his boat, which had drifted about 50 feet from shore. He noticed an \"overpowering stench\" in his clothes and hair that was not present until he met the strange be- ing. When Chastain arrived home his wife commented that he didn't look right and asked if he were all right. He said he told her he got seasick. (The Journal, Jacksonville, FL, 1/28/74) 1977 • An expedition of journalists was scheduled to set out for the Amazon area of Eastern Peru to check claims by a youth that he was saved from drowning there by four scaly lit- tle beings of human appearance who had three fingers on each hand. Jorge Alvarez, 20, a university student told a radio program called \"Interplanetary Contacts\" that he was heading for a river in Huanuco province, 260 miles east of Lima, to fetch water when he fell into a bog and sank rapidly. \"In spite of my struggles I was unable to get out and had given up all hope when suddenly four little men appeared, and grunting and gesticulating, extended several branches with which they pulled me to dry land.\" Alvarez said he then dropped with exhaustion and by the time he recovered the beings had disap- peared. \"They were less than three feet tall, they were covered with green scales and their hands which had three fingers each were cold and clammy.\" (The Herald, Buenos Aires, Argentina, 1/12/77, Reuters News Service) • Martha Cantu of Harrah, Wash- ington, said if her son ever tells her again to \"come and look,\" she'll be sure to do it. On the 19th, her agitated nine- year-old son, Jose, woke his mother at about 6:30 a.m., asking her to explain the little \"man\" he saw outside. She discounted his story and settled down to catch up on the sleep she'd lost the night before with a fussy baby. Jose, who had been in the middle of prepar- ing his breakfast, wasn't put off so easily. He went outside to check for himself and came back with an amaz- ing story. He told his mother he had seen two greenish beings about three MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 285 January 1992"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"feet tall, who rotated on a base instead of having feet, and two \"steely\" craft in which two other beings were sitting. He claimed that one craft rested in the backyard and the other on a flat sec- tion of the roof of the house. He told her he had hidden behind a washing machine stored outside next to a shed. From that vantage point, he saw the two creatures join the other two in their craft. He added that the vehicles were brilliantly lighted inside, had \"straight stairs\" (much like a ramp) and a door that opened in \"two parts, like a cross\" to reveal the interior which contained two chairs with very tall bases. Jose said the craft ascended and disappeared into something that resembled a cloud, steam or smoke. When she heard the story, Jose's mother did what any mother might do in the same circum- stances: She sent him to school. At the Harrah Grade School, Jose repeated the story to Diane Gomez, an aide. During the 10:10 recess time, Gomez and another aide accompanied Jose to his home. There he showed them the places where he said the two beings had been standing. In one loca- tion, where Jose said one being had rotated on his base, Gomez said she saw two round marks in the gravel. At another place, where the beings stood there were two sets of three indenta- tions. Later, Mrs. Cantu and her neighbor, Irene Sanchez, examined the backyard and found in the long grass a circular impression about 10 feet in diameter in which the grass in the mid- dle was swirled up. (The Review, Top- penish, WA, 1/26/77) 1982 • Frank Burke, a pastrycook in Nowra, NSW, Australia, said a light beam from an \"immense\" UFO melted his cassette recorder and seared the skin on his left leg. He was driving home from work through Kangaroo Valley, about 150 kilometers south of Sidney, about 10:30 p.m. when his car was sud- denly engulfed in blazing light. \"It lit up everything in a radius of 25 feet or more,\" he said. \"The glare was so in- tense I could have read the fine print in a newspaper or counted the ants at the roadside. The cassette recorder on the seat next to me stopped playing as soon as the light came one. Frankly I was terrified, mainly because a dead silence had settled over everything. Although the car kept going I couldn't hear a sound from the engine. \"At one stage I stopped because I could see flames licking around the wheels but I wasn't game to get out. The light ... followed me right up the mountain and only disappeared when another car came into sight.\" The next morning Burke noticed that his leg was extremely sore. The flesh was blistered and puckered. He was also suffering from double vision and his fingernails had begun to flake and fall off. \"But the biggest shock came when I got in- to the car,\" Burke said. \"My recorder's cassette carriage had been melted and buckled.\" Nowra police received several other reports of strange incidents in Kangaroo Valley. Three hunters returning from a shooting expedition were suddenly con- fronted by a human-like figure about two metres tall. When one of the men shot at the being it vanished, leaving behind what all three described as a \"powerful, horrible smell.\" One hunter was so overcome by the stench that he was sick for several hours. A local bus driver, George Sampson, was driving 40 pensioners from Yass to Nowra when a huge, brilliantly-lit ob- ject suddenly appeared above the coach. As everyone aboard watched, astounded, the intruder paced the coach for seven minutes, before vanishing up a shaft of light into the clouds.

To start with, he says that in his judgment there is little that is scientific about my vortex theory as the explanation for the circles effect. Fortunately, there are plenty of pro- fessors in physics and other scientific disciplines in the U.S.A., Britain, Japan, Germany, etc. who agree with me, and who for several years have proceeded to extend the ideas I initiated. So let us take a look at the matters which worry Mr. Wingfield. I maintain that a common cause of circle formation is the downward breakdown of what begins as an upspinning eddy- vortex formation in the lee of an obstacle like a hill (a hill is not an essential requirement, because atmospheric vor- tices can form in other ways too, but hill-induced vortices are comparatively common). As the \"bulge\" in the breakdown vortex reaches the ground it spins out the cir- cle, and eventually exhausts itself. Eyewitnesses have seen genuine circles forming this way in cereal crops, and several are well described in my books (cf, Circles From the Sky, The Circles Effect and Its Mysteries). Eddy vortices are real- ly quite common, but in turbulent air they die out so rapid- ly that they do not reach the ground upon which traces can be left. The origin of this spinning air is a large-scale windfield which upon encountering an obstacle creates the eddy. If this fresh, rising wind arrives at the obstacle, and divides and flows over it and around it at a time when the pre- existing air is quiet or perhaps calm, the eddy spins in what remains of this more sheltered air. In this event the breakdown vortex succeeds in reaching the ground because the air is not sufficiently turbulent to disrupt the votex. The effect is easily watched in water. Whirlpools form in the slightly quieter water downstream of the pier of a bridge, but they die out fairly quickly because of the overall degree of turbulence. However a person rowing on a lake creates whirlpools which have a much longer lifetime due to the near-stillness of the lakewater. Whence comes the energy to make the whirlpool? No marks for getting the answer to that one. But Mr. Wingfield is at a loss to know where the energy comes from in my hypothesis about crop-circle making, so he chooses to sensationalise his difficulty by claiming that the law of Conservation of Angular Momen- tum is infringed. Cannot he see that there is an enormous reservoir of energy in the invading windfield as it butts against and flows around the hill, and that a small fraction of this gets concentrated into the narrow core of the vortex? No laws are broken here. The next red herring is Mr. Wingfield's introduction of the Second Law of Ther- modynamics which, furthermore, he in- completely cites. He omits to say that it LETTERS is for a closed system that \"the entropy of a system either remains constant or increases.\" As the system must be viewed as a whole, the invading windfield is part of it. The so-called problem then disappears. Of course it is possible for a part of a system to have its degree of order temporarily raised, but that happens at the expense of increased disorder elsewhere; if not, one might pretend to wonder how a tor- nadic vortex could ever form in the presence of the chaotic winds of the thundercloud. Even the conventional summer whirlwind is able to split and reform itself into multiple, lesser whirlwinds — and this despite whatever the winds- of-the-day are. So, again, no laws are broken; nor are they in the circles-effect vortices of course. In fact, George's series of erroneous statements help to show how intrinsically anti-scientific his stance is. He even looks to be invoking the supernatural when writing of circles being produced by a non-human intelligence, for this implies something that is quite alien to human activity. Lastly, he cites the huge increase in circle numbers, cir- cle complexities and even circle revisitations (the so-called \"touch ups\"), as evidence to support his point of view and reject mine. Yet these very ideas are not in his favor anyway, for it is highly probable that these factors are the result of hoaxing, except that there is a part-contribution regarding increased circle numbers arising from the public's improved awareness of the phenomenon. Jenny Randies and Paul Fuller were correct to conclude that the whole area of UFO research now has the potential of being explained using my plasma-vortex meteorological link, because for a large number of events involving low-level, colored or pulsating UFO lights combined with ground traces, car stops, etc., there is a remarkable concordance between the location of the sighting and wind and weather details. The marvelous thing about this approach is that one can complete the analysis retrospectively for very old as well as for recent cases, as Randies, Fuller and I have shown, especially for cases which unknowingly happened to be downwind of hills. In short, the generalised plasma vortex theory is well, and getting healthier with each year that passes. Professor Ohtuski has demonstrated that spinning plasma is able to make circular marks on flat surfaces and elliptical marks on inclined surfaces just as I predicted. Professor Tokio Kikuchi has shown by computer calculations and simula- tions that descending vortices can create ringed as well as plain circles when striking a transverse plate. And I have shown that the Britons of the Neolithic and Bronze Ages made use of crop circles for their sacred Goddess rituals and built stone circles and burial mounds on top of them (The Goddess of the Stones). The spiral centre equates sym- bolically with the womb-opening of the Goddess and give rise to the idea that burial at such a place is equivalent to interring a corpse in the womb of the Goddess — and this is the perfect place for undergoing re- birth. Hence I succeed at decoding dozens of ancient stone carvings from Britain and Ireland which had defied the attentions MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 285 January 1991"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"of everyone previously. Moreover, the analysis has the advan- tage of explaining the long-standing conundrum of Alexander Thorn, as to how the ancient peoples could lay out ground plans that were egg-shaped or elliptical, in addition to the purely cir- cular ones. In fact I maintain that the rate of occurrence of genuine crop- circles is really quite low, anything from none to just a few each year, and that probably all the complex ones of the 1980's and 1990-1 which attract so much attention from the majority of people are simply fakes. This low fre- quency explains why few true circles had been seen prior to 1980, the year when I began this research, and why none chance to have been spotted earlier by aerial archaeologists. — Terence Meaden CERES, Circles Effect Research Bradford-on-Avon, Wiltshire, U.K. LETTERS, Continued Dear Editor: I enjoyed the November Journal, especially \"The Editor's Page.\" MUFON can be proud of this high quality periodical, and also of the pro- fessional caliber of its staff, directors and consultants. I feel proud to be a member. John Carpenter's article ('Another 'Interrupted Journey' \") was particular- ly intriguing and impressive. It certainly whetted my interest in finding out more details of this abduction story. How about a follow-up story going into a step-by-step scenario of the experience of Susan and Jennifer? I would like to hear what they felt and communicated during their contact with the aliens. The parts about \"genetic coding,\" \"mutual advancement of both races,\" and \"telepathic link\" deserve a great deal of amplification. Also, the previous encounter Susan experienced is a very important factor. The Night Sky Walter N. Webb February 1992 Bright Planets: (Evening Sky) Jupiter, near opposition in Leo, dominates the sky all month. Shining bright- ly, the giant planet rises in the E an hour after the sun early in February and moves westward during the night. By the 28th, it is opposite the Sun and at its brightest (magnitude -2.5), rising at sunset and remaining visible all night. Jupiter lies near the full moon on the night of February 18-19. Bright Planets: (Morning Sky) Four planets mass together low in the SE at dawn. On the 1st Venus (-4.0), rising shortly before twilight begins, is 9° to the upper right of Mars (1.3). The red planet is some 130 times fainter than our nearest planet neighbor. The same morning the lunar crescent lies only about 1° above Mars. Two telescopic planets also are nearby — Uranus (5.8) 2° W of Mars and Neptune (8.0) 1.5° N of the red planet. Later, on the 19th, Venus has closed to within 1° of Mars. Moon Phases: New moon — February 3 First quarter — February 11 Full moon — February 18 Last quarter — February 25 The Stars: O The brilliant star Sirius, in Canis Major the big Dog, appears due S at 9 PM and thus is at its highest altitude above the horizon. It is one of the bright luminaries composing the Winter Circle. Moving clockwise from Sirius, one can easily pick out the other members of the circle — Procyon in the con- stellation Canis Minor the Little Dog, Pollux and Castor in Gemini the Twins, Capella in Auriga the Charioteer, Aldebaran in Taurus the Bull, and Rigel in Orion the Hunter. The two brightest nocturnal stars lie one above the other separated by 37°. The lower star, Canopus, second brightest after Sirius, can be seen in the U.S. only from southern latitudes at this time of the year. In the NE the Big Dipper is once again clearly visible as it stands on its handle. A hint that spring is not that far off, Leo the Lion has risen above the E horizon by midevening. Look for his famous sickle-shaped head and chest. Jupiter is the dazzling interloper below the Sickle. Was any effort made through hypnosis to determine if the women have a history of multiple abductions, as is so commonly reported? Perhaps there is enough material for a book, per the Barney and Betty Hill episode. But at least we need further information in future issues of the Journal. Keep up the good work! — Joe Dundovic Minneapolis, MN MUFON UFO JOURNAL No. 285 January W92"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"MESSAGE, Continued the Doubletree Hotel in downtown Albuquerque, New Mexico. Hosted by New Mexico MUFON, Teresa Brito- Asenap is both the chairperson and State Director. The major meetings will take place in the attached Convention Center with enclosed walkways from the hotel. Two-hundred rooms have been blocked for July 10 and 11, and 60 rooms for July 9 and 12. The special group rates for the symposium are single or double occupancy at $60 per night. Reservations are now being ac- cepted by calling the Doubletree Hotel at (503) 247-3344 and advising the reservations desk that you will be at- tending the MUFON 1992 UFO Sym- posium in order to obtain the group rate. Speakers already confirmed are Stanton T. Friedman (Canada), Philippe Piet van Putten (Brazil), Richard F. Haines, Ph.D., J. Antonio Huneeus, and Richard M. Neal, M.D. Pavel Popovich, President of the Soviet UFO Association, pilot-cosmonaut of the USSR is interested in bringing five of their representatives to Albuquerque for the symposium. Your Director and Program Chairman has invited two of the members from Moscow to speak. Mr. Popovich has the responsibility to select two speakers and provide a translator if necessary. Field Investigator's Exam All Field Investigator Trainees are in- vited and encouraged to take the MUFON Field Investigator's Exam as a step in upgrading to Field Investigator. This is an open-book exam that is ad- ministered after the trainee studies the MUFON Field Investigator's Manual and reviews a high school physics book. It is a 100 multiple choice with a few true-false questions exam. A satisfac- tory grade must be received before the State Director will recommend promo- tion to Field Investigator. If you have complied with the above study program and feel that you are ready to take the exam, please contact your State/Provin- cial Director or MUFON in Seguin, Texas for a copy of the exam and answer sheet. The answer sheet is mailed to Shirley A. Coyne, Director for Field Investigator Training, per the enclosed instructions. All State Directors and State Section Directors should plan Field Investigator Training Courses to prepare their members to qualify for the exam. Since MUFON is basically an investigative and research organization, training field investigators is a prime responsibility of our state organizations. The Top Ten With the advent of 1992 and MUFON's 23rd anniversary, a few statistics clearly indicate where out- standing leadership in relation to state population has been significant. Last month Hugh B. Homing's Delaware group received accolades for their growth achievement in one year. In California where two population centers and geographical size dictates, MUFON has two state directors. Even though California has the largest state population in the U.S.A, the total number of members at 376 is significantly higher than Texas at 257, Florida with 235, New York coming in at 158 and Illinois close behind at 148. Massachusetts is in sixth place with 101. These statistics were taken from our November 27, 1991 computer listing that is mailed to all state and assistant state directors. Paul C. Cerny was recently presented a plaque from MUFON recognizing his 25 years of dedication to Ufology in California. Commenda- tions must also be extended to Charles D. Flannigan, Florida State Director and Thomas P. Stults, State Director for Illinois for their leadership and re- cent statewide growth. Other states in the top ten in membership are Penn- sylvania at 99, Virginia with 91, Washington growing rapidly to 89 and followed by New Jersey at 75. 3305 copies of the December 1991 issue of the MUFON UFO Journal were mailed to members/subscribers worldwide. As we enter the new year, it is not only enlightening, but a source of pride to review MUFON's consistent growth and to honor outstanding leadership. UFOs, MJ-12 and the Government Grant Cameron and T. Scott Crain's new book UFOs, MJ-12 and the Government: A Report on Government Involvement in the UFO Crash Retrievals (113 pages), published by the Mutual UFO Network, Inc. is another view of the intrigue and people associated with this controversial issue. This well written and documented book is essential to the library of everyone interested in the UFO crash/retrieval syndrome. It may be purchased from MUFON for $19 plus $1.50 postage and handling.
