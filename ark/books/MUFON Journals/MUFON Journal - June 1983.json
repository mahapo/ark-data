FROM THE EDITOR The summer doldrums apparently have set in, and current sightings of substance are somewhat rare. We do have word of new reports from the South and Southwest, and we will be reporting cases when summaries are received from investigators. For now, conferences and a flurry of newly forming multinational organizations dominate the scene. In the next few\" months we will have coverage of the Pasadena, Calif., MUFON symposium and the MUFON-N.C. Conference in Winston-Salem, among others, along with news of the new organizations.

Fenwick (Co-Director, Canadian UFO Research Network) (Note: The van incident occurred on Oct. 16, 1971 while the group was returning from a party in Vineland Station). Those present in the van were Jack, Calvin Stoddard, Sam J., Tom Irving, a teenager who was being given a ride back to St. Catharines, and possibly Sam J.'s girl friend and Ann Marie, Tom's wife. They were driving west along the North Service Road just 50 feet north of a main highway, the Queen Elizabeth Way. Tom was driving Jack's van. Torn spoke up as they reached the vicinity of Charles Daley Park. \"It looks like there's an accident ahead.\" Jack looked over Tom's shoulder and saw lights ahead across the road. Tom stopped the van at the roadside. He said \"You'd better take a look at this. You're not going to believe it.\" Jack said to the doctor: \"I saw a flying saucer on the road with lights panning back and forth all over the road. Blue lights came from the bottom and scanned the road like searchlights. There were portholes. There were little red lights around the perimeter and a dome shape on top.\" The object appeared to be gray but at night it was hard to say what color it actually was. The group collectively decided to turn back and get out of the area while they could. Calvin started to make a U-turn in the middle of the road but the steering wheel would not work.\" \"We started going towards the thing. Sam said Tom, what are you doing?' Tom replied: 'I haven't got any more control over the van.' The,UFO was pulling the van toward it. It was weird. He had his foot ,on the brake pedal trying to stop it, but the van kept moving towards the thing very slowly. You didn't feel any bumps like you would if you were driving. Then the van settled on the shoulder of the road and stopped maybe 20 feet away from the UFO. And you heard all these sounds coming out of it, like a street sweeper makes, or pneumatic air pressure being released with a hissing sound. Things like that. It looked hot. There was heat around it.\" \"Then Sam said to Tom: 'Do you see that?' Tom said, 'Yes.' He told him to be quiet. At this point, I was trying to see over the seat without being noticed, Sam kept telling me to get down. I said: 'What's going on?' He said: There's somebody coming out of it.' I could hear footsteps going alongside the van. We'd all decided to keep completely still and not make any sound. I heard them trying the door — Tom's door. I could see that' he was afraid. I could almost feel it, but he just kept looking straight ahead without moving. He didn't look at the alien at all, or whoever was trying the,door. \"I couldn't see any, face in the window, but the window right behind that was where I could see the top of the head and eyes go by — really dark, dark eyes, black pupils. A really strange looking head, bigger than ours. As it went by, it floated very evenly. There was no bobbing up and down like it was taking steps. It just floated by. And then it started rattling the doors at the back of the van. This guy that was in the van that we picked up — they must/have been working on him telepathically or something because, for some reason, he leaned over to the back of the door and I thought he was checking to see if it was locked, but instead he opened it. Both doors opened and I saw four aliens standing outside.\"., \"One — I'm trying to remember if he jumped or climbed or what. I don't remember how he got into the van, but I guess he stepped up into the van. At this point, we were in a lot of fear. We were thinking about trying to find something to fight them with, as if we were being attacked, but the alien came in. He put our minds at ease about an attack. It felt like he was communicating through his eyes more than his mouth. His mouth didn't seem to be moving. When he'd look at somebody else, the volume seemed to decrease, but I could still hear what he was saying. \"When he looked directly at me, I could understand him perfectly. He was telling us that they had no intention of hurting us or being hostile, that we would be unable to move or speak and that he was doing that to us because he was afraid for his safety and the safety of his crew. He knew we were thinking about harming them. He told us that all that they wanted to do was run a few tests on some of us.\" Jack said the humanoids had no eyebrows, the head was very large in proportion to their bodies, and the mouth was small and slit-like. Jack continued: \"At this point, I don't know how, but he tripped over the drum stand and knocked over one drum. It rolled out of the van. One of the two aliens who were standing outside the van picked up the drum and looked at it. I went out carrying my bag with my recorders in it. Hooked at the drum and took it from the alien. He asked me what it was. I told him and pointed to Sam, the drummer and I said, 'He plays the drums.' Tom walked out of the van and saw me holding the drum at the back of the van. The alien asked me if the drum was damaged. I said it was all right. The alien tried to put the drum back on the drum stand in the van. He gave up and put it on the van's floor. The alien looked at my bag and asked what was in it. I took out one of my recorders. He asked me what it was. I didn't want to answer him. I showed him how it was played. I brought the alien back into the van. \"The alien told us that he couldn't test all of us because they didn't have the equipment for it or the time. So he wanted to do three of us. He said that he'd bring us back and we could go on our way when they'd finished. So he (continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Canada, continued started to look around. I had gotten my fear under control. He picked Calvin and Sam and me. \"I followed the alien and entered the UFO. I noticed the wall inside the door. It was cold inside and black. But the wall curved and one part of the inside was lit up. There were two aliens there. One of them told me to take off my.shirt, which I did. I still had one of my recorders with me. I was worried about what the aliens would do to me. They put me on the floor. There was a cot at the far end. They took Calvin, the bass man, out of the room. Sam argued. He didn't want to disrobe. I laughed at Sam's attempt to refuse. \"There was another cot near where I was and it had instruments on it, like dental instruments, as if they were used for doing examinations/One of the aliens picked up one which looked like the handle of a Contempra telephone. It was all black. He tried to demonstrate it to me. He placed it against his arm which was covered by his sleeves. I could see through the sleeve and into his arm. All I could see was the faint outline of what looked like a bone. There was a light coming from the entire side of the tool which seemed to act like an X-ray. Then he shone it against my right arm. There was no pain. I could see my muscles and veins and I could see what my pulse was like as the blood pumped into the veins. The alien told me to lie down. They shone a big light on my head. It looked like a neon light and was attached to a big arm-like machine. The beam was silvery and moved around. I got my hand in the way then and it hurt my hand a bit. They made a cut near my ear. \"The machine itself looked like a dentist's machine, as it moved over the top of me. It was metallic. When the thing pointed down, it looked like a drill or knife. It had all kinds of arms on it with different devices. All the aliens were examining me with parts of the thing. Checking me over. The room seemed to acquire a sense of business. Everybody seemed to be serious about what they were doing. They were all 'hustling about. Everybody was doing their job — different jobs. It was like an 4 operating room. ThSre'wer^ all these instruments on me. There were wires. They were pressing down on me on certain parts of my skin.\" \"I don't know if there was another part after that or not, but they definitely seemed to have collected the information. They had little bags that contained samples that they had taken from me, such as hair. This machine — they took it away somehow. I don't know if they wheeled it away or if it just folded up and went into the galley. They sat me up. They may have made me look at that writing. They wheeled me over to another part of the ship, back to where my clothes were. They had a table there that had instruments inside. They were folding them up in white cloth and putting them away.\" A Question On Religion \"They asked us if we wanted to ask them any questions, that this was the time to do it. So Sam — Calvin, I don't think asked any — seemed kind of curious. He asked them where they come from. They told him it was a long ways away. It wasn't part of our solar system, and that he wouldn't understand if they told him. Then I decided to ask them a question because, for some reason, this idea came into my head that these beings could have been angels. I don't want to tell them that that's what I thought, but I asked them what the correct religion on Earth was. They seemed surprised. They stopped what they were doing. Two of them looked at me. They said: 'Why did you ask that?,' I said: 'Because I feel that you people are more advanced than we are in all kinds of ways, not just telepathically, but socially and probably more spiritually advanced than we are, and, if anyone would know what the correct religion would be, it would be you.' \"He said: 'Are you a member of a religion now?' I said: 'No, but I used to be. I was brought up in a religion.' He asked me what it was and I said: 'I was brought up as a Jehovah's Witness, but I don't follow the path anymore. I don't believe in it. Is that the correct religion?' He said: 'No.' I said: 'Well, what is?' He said: There is no correct religion on Earth.' Then he cut me off at that point. I wanted to ask him more, but he wouldn't get into that subject with me. I kept picking up their thoughts, but he didn't want to interfere with my judgment on religious matters. They wanted to leave that up to me. They just wanted to ask me some run of the mill questions. But I wanted to catch them off guard.\" Dr. Clamar asked: \"How did you know which one was their leader?\" Jack said: \"He was the more dominant one of them all. He was the one who made all of the major moves and did all of the dirty work like coming into the van, putting us under a spell, or whatever. The other guys just sort of stood in the background and waited. He seemed to be directing everything. He had the crew trained very well. They didn't question him. They knew exactly what to do. They were exremely efficient. \"After I put my clothes on, I was standing there talking to him for a while. I could see more of what he looked like at that point. I had my recorders with me. He'd already sent Calvin back. I wasn't sure at that time whether he had or not, but when I got back to the van, Calvin was there. Sam seemed to be more relaxed and now he was smiling and he said goodbye. They thanked him for coming along. So he walked back to the van. I didn't go with him. I wanted to talk to them a little more. I didn't want the experience to end. It had been very interesting for me to go through something like that. \"The leader was standing there by the door. He started to tell me things that touched me. Things about myself and my life. He knew there was some kind of affinity between me and him. Almost like he was a member of the family. I felt very close to him. Just this feeling alone made me feel sad. It was like a love. The kind of love you feel for a best friend, or someone you really care for. I think this was where I started crying. I wasn't crying loud,, but it was just that it brought tears to my eyes. A Musical Souvenir \"He told me that he'd see me again and that there was lots of work yet to be (continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Canada, Continued done, and that I'd been a very good subject. He said that he was going to give me a purpose and I would be of great help to my friends and people around me. The things that he said to me really made me feel good. He left me with a feeling of usefulness — that I'd really helped them. He was grateful and he said — I was so emotionally tied up with wht he was saying that it's really with what he was saying that it's really hurt me deeply — he had decided to break the tension by asking me if there was something that I wanted to show him now. I didn't want the tension to be broken at that point. I was still thinking about what he had said. I broke it off and I remembered that I wanted to show him my recorders. So I said: 'I've got some musical instruments in here that I'd like to show you,' and he said: 'Could I see them?' So I handed him the bag by the string. He took it by the bottom of the string, below it. He lifted it off my hand and started to look at them. \"I had three or four recorders in there. The tenor, I think, the largest of the recorders, was in two pieces. I had taken it apart so it would fit better in the bag. I asked him if I could put it together to show him what it's supposed to look like. He said: 'Yes.' I walked over to him and I opened up the bag and I took the tenor out and put the mouthpiece on top of the other part. Then I showed it to him. He said 'How do you play these?' I played a couple of notes on it and I said: 'You play it be blowing air into it and covering the holes.' So he looked at it. He took the other one out — the alto — and said: 'What is this one? How is it different?' And I said 'It plays a little higher key than the other one. The notes are a little higher, but it works basically the same.' \"And there was the smallest one that I took out and showed him that one and I played a little on each one for him to show him the difference. He seemed very interested and then I started thinking about the little one — that maybe I should give it to him as a gift. So I asked him. I took the bag back off him, I had the little one in my hand and asked him if he'd like to take it back with him as a souvenir. He said: That would be s u- -- •• • i • The Recorder Bag fine.' So I handed it to him. Then he reached out to take it from me and I saw his hand. It was really a strange-looking hand. It was really rough-looking skin, the thumb was wide and black. The fingers — the ends of them were wide. They seemed to taper a little, but there was a bit of fold on the ends of them. I was really amazed looking at his hand. \"As Sam was walking out the door, he was talking to one of the aliens. I could hear their conversation in my mind. Sam asked them if they had any bases in our solar system. The alien said that they had a few, and that they had some on planets in other solar systems, as well as some here on Earth. In fact, he said, pointing toward Lake Ontario, we have one there.\" The 1976 incident involved his ex- wife and himself and was not an abduction case. It was a CE3. Due to his emotional attachment to her, Jack wants no details released. Bill T. told Harry and Joe of a theory he had formulated over the years since the Owen Sound automobile incident. He feels the aliens want to eliminate \"corrupt\" blood if it exists in the \"family tree.\" The \"corruption\" is the genetic inheritance of diseases such as cancer or a history of family members having had heart trouble. The humanoids would cut off these unwanted strains from the male genes by preventing third generations of those they abduct from having male heirs. This is done by mental manipulation. Abductees are programmed to avoid marriage, or if they do marry, it is one whose family history shows mostly female offspring. If abductees do have male children, these may be the second or the third and final generation of males in the family, unless there is absolutely no history of males in the family having serious genetically-inherited diseases. Only then.are exceptions made. CUFORN has, a list of abductees who have no male heirs and who may have fulfilled the humanoids' purpose. These may be either first, second, or third generation abductees. Jack told CUFORN that the humanoids told him that they travel from their home planet to other places in the universe instantly. This amounts to instant transference, so that time and distance pose no barrier. Dr. Schulman summarized the case by saying that hypnosis alone could f not determine whether the individual was telling the truth, although she felt that Jack believed that what he was saying was the truth. She also felt that, on the negative side, the more detail Jack gave under hypnosis, the less believable, (i.e., the more chance of fantasizing to fill in holes in the story). Again, on the negative side, Jack had read Missing Time and sought out the author, Budd Hopkins. On the positive side was the fact that CUFORN had to urge Jack to pursue the case further. The doctor detected no unconscious motivation such as publicity or grandiose illusions. She said that perhaps this whole thing was something beyond our comprehension. In speculating, she suggested that the mental blocks we met actually have been inserted by good forces and we are playing with fire and may hurt something or someone. Dr. R. Leo Sprinkle, psychologist and UFOlogist, wrote to Harry Tokarz on November 23,1982: \"I am impressed with the observations which you and your colleagues have noted in the on- going investigation. I am familiar with these types of observations, although the comment about \"interference (continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"'MISSING TIME\" AS MISSING LINK A COMMENTARY By Dana M. Schmidt (MUFON New York State Section Director) The key question aroused by the UFO phenomena may now have been answered. That question, of course, is why? Most particularly, why have humans been abducted by the pilots of UFOs? (I assume here that the reports are accurate.) It is not hard to guess that we are being observed, if indeed the UFOs have observers. But the kind of high strangeness reported by abductees goes beyond mere observation and raises this nagging \"why.\" In Budd Hopkins' 1982 book, Missing Time, Mr. Hopkins may have found the answer. Although his work does not supply enough details on each reported abduction to allow a correlation study of the phenomena, something which I offer to undertake if I can get the data, he does give a hint that may answer the \"why.\" Specifically, in Chapter 9 in discussing Virginia Hprton's double abduction he suggests that the purpose for her abduction was to make a clone of her, and that this was successful. What Mr. Hopkins does not expressly state is the logical extension of this conclusion. Given the apparent interest of abductors in taking human sperm from males (viz, the Carl Higdon abduction), and eggs from females (viz., Betty Hill), and now, a cell to clone Canada, Continued through the women\" was fascinating to me. I agree with the notion that the phenomenon fosters belief (and action), but does not yield to logical analysis: As you know, my feeling is that the best principle is to follow the three steps: become aware, accept, and acknowledge .the presence of the intelligent beings in our lives; then we can find out what our mission or task or project may be. \"I offer you my best wishes for your continued investigation and I'll be glad to correspond with you about further comments or questions.\" 6 Virginia Horton, what is it \"they\" are up to? It must only be, to produce humans in captivity. One can even imagine this scenario: The earlier abductions of Betty Hill and Carl Higdon were intended to collect human egg and sperm, respectively, to create human life ex vivo. Talk about test tube babies, this would have been the real thing. But for some reason, it did not work, so with Virginia (and apparently, others in 1950), they tried cloning. Budd Hopkins points to the celebration scene in Virginia Horton's second abduction as evidence of success in raising humans, but within the UFO society, whatever that might be. But the logical extension (mine, not Budd's) goes even farther. Why would they want to raise humans in captivity? At the risk of being too anthropomorphic, the answer would seem to be obvious from our own experience: To preserve an earth-like habitat in case the real thing is destroyed. That is what humans do if, destroyed. That is what we humans do if, say, a portion of Africa's rain forest is threatened as a habitat for a species — we try to raise the species in an artificial environment to preserve it. Is there any evidence that preservation against destruction of the real thing is the ultimate purpose? Budd Hopkins points to one telling piece of evidence, the apparent love or interest of Virginia's abductor to preserve the variety of all species, about which love Virginia had much to report. I would point to another piece — the apparent propensity of UFO occupants to take other animal, and vegetable, specimens as well. Frankly, I am alarmed by this \"ultimate purpose,\" if indeed this is it. Do \"they\" know something we do not, and is it that we are closer to Armageddon than we think? Or are \"they\" assigned the task of setting up duplicates of all inhabited planets, to hedge the bet against accidental as well as deliberate destruction? Such questions may prove to be the most difficult of all to answer. There is, however, one thing that I have suggested to Budd that he verify: To check his clone theory, he should have Virginia hypnotized one more time (or check his tapes of the previous sessions) to ask: Was in fact the bouncy young female that Virginia visited aboard the UFO the second time, a human or an alien? This was not clear. If an alien, then the clone theory fails, as do my speculations. Finally, if other researchers have evidence bearing on the preservation.of the species as the raison d'etre for the UFO abductions, I suggest they contact Budd, MUFON headquarters, or myself. SUPPORT MUFON MUFON needs a larger membership/readership in order to be more effective in pursuing our goals of UFO research and public education. We suggest that State MUFON organizations, and individual members as well, consider gift subscriptions of the Journal, for friends, relatives, libraries, or your doctor or dentist for waiting room reading material. State organizations should encourage their members and consultants to take out additional subscriptions as a means of supporting MUFON and disseminating information. Also, if you know someone who may be interested in becoming a member or subscriber, send us their name and address and we will mail them a complimentary copy of the Journal along with information about the goals and purposes of MUFON.

Lcming At this writing, facts are still being gathered to lend support to the theory that the typical, if indeed you can call them typical, contactee/abductee is in fact a very normal person that is caught up in very \"abnormal\" circumstances. I am going to try, with the help of this article, to set a few things straight — or at least make the results a little more understandable to those people ,who haven't got the beginnings of an idea as to how to deal with the same situation, were the tables turned. Names like Walton, Andreasson- Luca, Hill, Higdon, and Moody do not ring true to those who do not study the annals of UFOlogy. They could be Roger Penske's pit crew, or the back-up girls for the Rockettes. But in fact they are the names of perfectly normal people that have been given a \"guilt trip\" the size of the moon to carry with them ONLY because what they are trying to relate to others is not acceptable to the conformists' point of view. If these people could only tellhow their entire concept of life has been changed, without sounding like they were trying to change the world through mass revelations given them by the \"space brothers.\" I don't think that enough is being said about the people in general. .Granted there have been some who were, shall we say, \"wrapped a little too tightly\" and these unfortunates were the ones always saddled by the press. I personally would be more interested in how these particular people are currently dealing with everyday decisions and how their outlook on certain topics has changed. This, I think, will say more about the event than any \"hidden message\" ever could. It all comes back to a very important statement that Ted Phillips made some time ago concerning the \"double standard\" in UFO investigation. I can't quote him exactly but the gist was, \"Should a person witness a crime such as murder or robbery, their testimony alone could be sufficient evidence to convict another human being and remove him or her from society for a long period of time. And the very same individual could report a sighting and all of a sudden his or her testimony is invalid? Why? The witness's mind is still the same.\" I have a very good illustrating point to share that .was related to me first- hand as a personal experience. This particular individual had a contactee/abductee, experience that is still under investigation and facts are still being correlated. The basic story deals with lingering dreams that tried to tell this person that something specific was expected to be done. It was like having a house that was half finished and trying to live in it. You know right away that something is missing, but you are at a loss as to how to correct the problem. Its a feeling that nags at you until you actually begin to question the fact that you had a UFO experience at all! You cannot appreciate the implications until you are in the> same situation. Your mind is going a million miles an hour, and you are desperately trying not tdtake yourself too seriously only because you are trying to keep your sanity. Its a pretty empty, lonely feeling that comes over you. Your spouse notices a change but tries to remain supportive throughout the ordeal. It is a shallow comfort at best. I would like to pass along some personal advice if I might; should you happen to run across a possible contactee/ abuctee in your particular area of investigation, DON'T ask what happened aboard the ship. Ask, \"What are you feeling that is different than before? How are you relating to the changes that have come about since the incident?\" Whether or not the person was given a \"message\" is really not that important. Passing on this point of information will help the interviewee relax. Trying not to sound like \"Scoop\" Nebroski of the National Enquirer will aid in uncovering some facts that would under other circumstances remain hidden. People that have been contacted have such a swelling of their capacity to understand that quick, pointed questions like, \"What did they look like?\" or, \"Was the inside of their ship blue?\" carries with it no real meaning or significance. Why would you care what the inside looked like when you were just given the key to the universe? With all due respect, knowing how the inside of a ship works is better left to the people who understand such things. There are some who question the mechanics of a blackboard eraser, so how are they able to help? Because they cannot explain what they have seen, does this mean that they could not possibly possess any worthwhile knowledge? All I want people to do is get past the ends of their collective noses and look at the real article. How has this person been changed? (A/hy does this person feel that no one understands? (and very rarely does anybody understand). Just think for a minute. . . . You are an abductee. How do you tell someone without being snickered at? You know what happened; why can't they see it? You have several minutes or possibly hours missing from your life that no one seems to care about. These alternatives await the most sincere abductee. So when you stop and figure out that a contactee has an even slimmer chance^ of getting through, should it be , a wonder that most instances go unreported? It's up to us — the investigators — to ease people in volatile surroundings into discussing the possible reasons that he or she was chosen. And, if in fact, these people were chosen, we have the makings of world History, so we better be prepared to accept alternative paths to follow.^"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"ML ON YAKIMA INDIAN RESERVATION By Greg Long (Staff Writer) On September 9, 1982, a family of three and a fire lookout on a fire station - on a high peak on the Yakima Indian Reservation in south-central Washington State observed a nocturnal light (NL) over the Reservation, traveling slowly in a westerly to easterly direction. At 10:25 p.m., the lookout alerted the father, during a radio conversation with him, of the presence of a bright light over the Medicine Valley area of the Reservation. Two members of the family rushed outside with a telescope and a pair of binoculars, while the father remained inside and confirmed the continuous presence of the NL to the lookout during the ensuing events. When first alerted, the father stepped to the front window of the house and saw a bright, yellowish- orange light about the size of a pea situated slightly above Ahtanum Ridge to the northwest. He visually \"held\" the light at the edge of one of the crossbars of the window and judged that the light was motionless. The father believes that the lookout saw the light appear. He stated: \"It just came on. . . there it was.\" After about 30 seconds, the father returned to the radio and continued his conversation with the lookout. The light, he told me, was not sharp-edged or well-defined, but definitely was not a star. The rest of the family (the mother and son) watched the light through, respectively, the binoculars and the telescope. (Note that the mother wears corrective lenses, and she took these off while looking through the binoculars.) The son attached the telescope to the mirror of the family vehicle (parked a short distance from the house), and the mother propped her elbows on the same vehicle and observed the light through the binoculars. The night was clear with a few clouds. Through the telescope, the son observed two very bright, pale-orange 8 lights the color of amber warning lights common on rough-roadway signs. The lights were in a horizontal configuration. A very faint bluish light (a star?) was positioned on the \"trailing edge,\" (i.e., to the left and slightly down). The mother, with her glasses off, observed through binoculars two lights running together, forming an oval-shaped light. She also saw a third, faint light to the left. the light(s) traveled southeasterly in a series of slow \"stop-go\" motions, and gradually turned to the east in a broad arc. During the sighting, an aircraft (most likely propeller-driven) flew over Toppenish Ridge from the south. The family estimated the distance of the plane at 2.5 to 3.5 miles. When the plane approached the light, the UFO dimmed down and was not visible to the naked eye. However, through the aid of the glasses, the witnesses saw two orangeish lights (apparently the original two lights) and a string of smaller, dimmer lights aligned horizontally to the left, forming an apparent configuration of \"windows\" — although the mother and son admitted that the \"windows\" were not square and were at best only point sources. In fact, neither mother nor son could recall the exact number of these smaller lights; estimates ranged from five to a dozen. The two original lights were, the son said, a \"tad bit\" brighter than the point sources. The aircraft passed either under or west of the light. About a minute later, the original light \"came back on.\" This action was observed with the naked eye. However, the mother and son now observed three additional lights that may have come on at the same instant although neither witnessed their appearances. These lights had the same size and were as bright as the primary light. The lights may not have been arranged in any indentifiable geometric configuration (triangle, trapezoid, etc.) since neither witness could adequately describe the exact location of each light in relation to the other. For example, contradictory statements were made that the lights were \"lined up\" and that they weren't. The four lights traveled easterly and were finally lost from view in the distance. Conclusions The father estimated that the original light was at an altitude of 4,000 to 5,000 feet when he first observed it. He determined this elevation by relating the position of the light to the lookout peak and by noting that the NL was barely above the mountains when he first saw it. The NL definitely had low angular elevation, he said. Curiously, at the beginning of the sighting, the son noted through the telescope something without discernible shape or size passing periodically (about one pass per second) in front of the light. He attempted fruitlessly to determine the source of the obscuring object, which eventually vanished before the other major events transpired. It is also interesting to note that during my interivew with the family, the mother and son attempted to relate the two lights and the additional string of lights to concepts such as \"front\" and \"back,\" \"craft,\" \"fuselage,\" and \"headlights.\" Although no body was observed related to the lights, these concepts could very well be accurate attempts to formulate a true picture, although the danger lies that the witnesses were drawing upon preset notions of what \"spacecraft\" look like. Except for the dimming action, the NLs never flickered, changed shape or size, or performed erratic behavior during the entire sighting.

To cope with this plethora of esoteric hypotheses, we tend to develop. some method . to quickly discredit and dismiss any new one that comes along. Take the Persinger theory, for instance. We've heard it says something about earth stress causing UFOs. Oho, we answer, that's obviously absurd because a lot of UFOs are reported in places where there aren't any earthquakes. And we hear too that Persinger says those earth stresses affect the brain, causing people to make up and believe \"abductibn\"- type stories; we easily toss that one aside along with such exotica as the one claiming UFOs come out of a hole in the earth near the North Pole. But let's take a closer look at Persinger's theory. Part of it has impressive statistical support, although the physical operation is not entirely clear. And even his more extreme suggestion, of the electromagnetic effect on the brain, presents an interesting theory, though a harder one to demonstrate quantitatively. First, some background. Michael A. Persinger is a professor of psychology and neurobiology and head of the Neuroscience Laboratory Yakima, Continued and the string of lights is indeed puzzling. The sighting lasted between 15 and 25 minutes as the witnesses can best determine. The father noted the exact time the sighting began when in the kitchen talking qn the radio, but did not note the end. When available, the lookout's report of the event will supplement this one. I consider the family, whom I have interviewed before, to be reliable and composed of good observers. at Laurentian University in Sudbury, Ontario. His interest in UFOs and the paranormal goes back to the mid- 1960's, when he began an analysis of a large number of paranormal cases, taken from Fate magazine and other sources, seeking patterns of occurrence such as time of day and time of year, and noting the problems of selective memory, distortion, and self- fulfilling prophecy that affected the reports. His two-volume report The Paranormal (1974) appears to include his first speculation which he developed into his theories; he suggests that high- voltage fields might be responsible for some UFOs, and that the mechanism which produces the glow might also distort a person's interpretation of what he sees (The Paranormal, Part I}, pg. 186-187).'' 1 By 1967, when he was in graduate school, he came to realize the inadequacy of the Fate material — much of it was recorded 10 years or more after it happened, any many of the events involved some sort of personal crisis that may distort the memory. He moved his focus, therefore, to the work of Charles Fort, which not only presented clearer data but posed a problem that science had not approached seriously: the problem of localized and transient phenomena, particularly infrequent ones. Traditional science, as Persinger points out, works on the capability of replication and the similarity of sampling (i.e., two chemicals, when mixed, will react the same way anywhere), but the kind of space-time transients Fort discussed challenged \" these assumptions. Persinger reasoned that one way around this problem was to expand the space and time frame — to deal with a very large number of reports over as much territory as possible. Consequently, he gathered data from the Fort books, from various scientific journals, from newspaper clippings, from Fate magazine, and much from William Corliss' collections. From this massive data base he was able to project patterns in space and time for many kinds of unusual events. In his 1977 book Space-Time Transients and Unusual Events 2 (with his assistant Gyslaine F. Lafreniere as co-author) he reports on such Fortean events as ice falls (which nowadays follow a different pattern than before, presumably because of high-altitude jet airplanes), animal falls from the sky (43% of which , happen in the summer), and what he terms UFORs — UFO Reports, where he quite properly adds the word \"report\" to call attention to the fact that any individual UFO report may involve only a single person's perception lasting only a few seconds, of \"something\" that might not necessarily be what \"we consider an \"object.\" He found that UFO reports peaked in April, then hit a higher and more rounded peak in July, August, and September, a pattern which showed in both American reports and those from other parts of the world. He mapped the location of UFORs and of non-UFO strange events in the United States, and found that these maps overlap with major population centers, reflecting the greater number of observers. But there were some deviations from what was expected, particularly iii the Midwest. Another pattern he discovered was the correlation between UFORs (as well as other unusual or Fortean events) and areas of seismic activity. This is not just a matter of \"earthquake lights,\" a phenomenon linown for hundreds of years of glowing lights at or around the time of an earthquake. Persinger finds increased UFOR acitvity in these regions at other times as well; in general, increases in UFORs in the 2 years before low-intensity earthquakes, and up to 4 years before (continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"Pcrsingcr Theory, Continued major quakes. He suggested in the 1977 book that pressure forces pushing on rock crystals in a large area may produce an electric field, which could ionize in a local area into visible \"luminosities,\" and might cause other Fortean activity, such as precipitation of water vapor, rock movement, and even attract animals. Later studies indicate some other possible scenarios for these lights. Persinger emphasizes that this connection of UFORs and seismic activity is an empirical observation, not just a theory, and it holds with data from England, Europe, and the United States, and for the early part of the century when Fort was collecting material, as well as currently. A particularly valuable documen- tation of the theory comes from his study and analysis of luminosities and other Fortean events for a 30-year period (1943-1973) in the New Madrid seismic area, which extends from southernmost Illinois and Indiana through southeast Missouri and into northeast Arkansas, including parts of westernmost Kentucky and Tennessee. He showed a strong correlation of numbers of low-intensity earthquakes with UFOR numbers of the previous 2 year period, and also a connection between seismic activity and Fortean events such as poltergeists, animal mutilations, and other unusual activities. 5 Now, on to Persinger's theory. It involves three separable matters. While I presume Persinger sees all three aspects as inevitably flowing together, it's possible, if you wish, to reject one part of the theory while accepting another. The first element is a matter of definition, and as such is not in dispute (although it is part of the widespread misunderstanding of his work). Persinger is talking only about a certain kind of documented luminous events. He is not talking about those rare types known as earthquake lights, or those known as ball lightning. His theory deals specifically with the traditional category of \"luminosities,\" the term used in the last century for some of what are called UFOs now. His theory 10 does not deal with the many other kinds of events that are popularly subsumed in what he terms \"the overinclusive label UFO.\" The second element stems from the large-scale space/time patterns he has traced that demonstrate both present and past relationships between reports of luminosities and of tectonic strain as measured by seismic activity. He has extensively documented this correlation in a continuing series of technical articles in the journal Perceptual and Motor Skills* For the technical side of how this effect occurs, he works with Dr. Brian Brady, a physicist with the U.S. Bureau of Mines in Denver. Persinger believes that the effect may come from a special electricity-generating property of quartz under compression. Brady and his associates have reproduced this effect in the laboratory. 7 Recently Brady reports a significant breakthrough to a funda- mentally different kind of phenomenon, and he and his co-workers believe they have duplicated all the major field characteristics of these luminosities, including spin, color change, ejection of materials, and others. His estimates of the core magnetic field intensities of the luminous ball appear to match favorably with the type of intensities required to alter automotive engine and electrical systems, an effect often noted in UFO reports. (Ed. Note: Having consulted with many physical scientists about E-M effects, I believe this paragraph contains highly questionable information. Comments from qualified scientists invited.) The third element of Persinger's theory holds that certain types of elctromagnetic fields can distort the elctromagnetic events within and between neurons in the brain. Furthermore, once this distortion occurs, the sequence of these EM signals may be permanently coded, giving a person a \"real memory\" that does not represent an actual event, he holds that coming close to a luminosity would affect the temporal lobe, which is heavily involved with memory as well as with dreaming, anxiety, and deperson- alization. He emphasizes that the person so affected would believe their experiences to be real. Persinger's interpretation of the Travis Walton event demonstrates the sweep of his theory: he believes Walton and his six co-workers saw a huge luminosity associated with a massive electrical discharge. Walton was struck down by a \"bolt\" from it as he approached it, serving as a conductor much like a single tall tree on a flat plain draws lightning in a thunderstorm. The effect was powerful enough to knock him unconscious, or at least put him in a \"trance\" or into \"sleepwalking.\" He developed a typical dreamlike experience — a composite of fantasy, previous associations with unusual events, and the actual details. Persinger thinks Walton should not be considered psychotic or deluded; his behavior was \"normal\" in the context of the intense physical stimulus. 3 (Persinger used the Walton case as an illustration of his theory; he does not speculate on the details of where Walton was during the 5 days he was missing and the object of an intensive search.) Persinger insists that his analyses of luminosities are based on clear, routine statistical procedures, using contemporary analytical tools with a testable hypothesis. \"At present,\" he adds, \"UFO research is loaded by the old school of researchers, such as Rogo and Coleman, who are quite effective at first order evaluation and descriptive procedures. Their types of data collection are important during the earlier stage of any science.\" He believes, however, that the present UFO problem — or at least the luminosity part of the problem — requires the kind of analysis he has done. Persinger's model, at its simplest, declares that UFO luminosity phenomena are generated by processes, yet to be specified, associated with tectonic strain. Persinger's data shows UFORs weeks to years before earthquakes, but there appears to be an optimal strain condition since most UFORs occur during the 6 months before increases in low magnitude quakes. The greater the imminent quake activity, the more intense the UFORs. Yet to be (confinued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"Persinger Theory, Continued determined is whether one can predict the magnitude of the coming earthquake by the number of luminosity reports or by the duration/size of the average one. The other part of Persinger's theory, about the EM effect of a luminosity/UFO on the brain, is of course hard to prove. Neurosurgeons have observed such effects during brain surgery, but for obvious ethical reasons cannot experiment, although the- effects he postulates are consistent with known neurofunction. Persinger remarks: The truly ironic aspect of all this is that when a ward patient with a temporal lobe disorder reports a \"close encounter\" experience, due to a transient seizure within the brain, the details are dismissed as rubbish. But when a person on a deserted road approaches a source that would induce a similar seizure within his brain, and reports a similar experience, it is believed immediately!\" The toughest problem facing the Persinger theory is a public relations one, that of acceptance. We all resist change, and people in the UFO movement who have been espousing an extraterrestrial or other theory are not about to give up their strongly-held beliefs, particularly when they are based on long personal investigation and speculation on UFOs. Harley Rutledge, a professor of physics at Southeast Missouri State University, conducted .a 6 year-long project to record and photograph UFOs in his region — which happens to be right in the middle of the New Madrid fault area. I happened to read Rutledge's book Project Identification,* describing his work, immediately after reading Persinger's book, and was impressed by what seemed to me a considerable correlation. When I asked Rutledge about this, he replied that he had not read Persinger's book prior to writing his, but had read it since, and commented only that it seemed \"quite scholarly.\" He said: At this time, I choose not to enter into controversy. Neverthless, I won't accept any explanation for the phenomena we observed until WORLD UFOLOGICAL ASSOCIATION By Willy Smith, PhD (MUFON Georgia State Director) Further steps toward structuring the WORLD UFOLOGICAL ASSOCIATION (WUA) were taken during the Second International Congress of UFOlogy, which took place in Brasilia, Brazil, April 17-21, 1983. The matter was discussed extensively by UFOlogists of different countries attending the Congress, and in agreement with the resolutions taken in Rosario, Argentina, in December 1982, tentative Bylaws and Regulations were proposed by members from Argentina. According to those Bylaws, the new association will have a Board of Directors composed of seven members from different parts of the world, to.be appointed by Dr. J. Allen Hynek, who was elected as temporary chairman. It was emphasized that the WUA is made up of individuals, not organizations or country representatives. When interviewed by the JORNAL DE BRASILIA, Dr. Hynek indicated his hopes that the WUA will be functioning within two years, assuming responsibility for the dissemination of all information related to the UFO phenomenon, such as reports of incidents and case studies. Dr. Hynek explained that the major difficulty will be to find honest, highly responsible individuals of integrity, wishing to work for the success of the WUA. He suggested that those suitable persons should have a long involvement with the phenomenon, perhaps with years of field experience, and possess a good theoretical knowledge of the subject. Dr. Hynek and Mrs. Cynthia Hind, from South Africa, were appointed to present the news of the creation of the WUA during the Provisional International Committee for UFO Research (PICUR) meeting, to take place in London in August of this year, and remarked that the WUA, as an organization of individuals, does not conflict with, but rather complements, the objectives of PICUR. it is proved beyond a doubt. Not to worry. There's not much of anything in the UFO field that can be proved beyond a doubt. I can understand Rutledge's feeling: he's put 6 years of his life into his UFO project, spending long chilly hours atop some mountain watching for anomalous lights, and directing the work of 620 observers from 159 different stations. In discussing in his book possible causes of the UFOs he and his co-workers saw, he does suggest that UFOs may have an \"affinity\" for the New Madrid earthquake fault. For me, sitting here reading these books, it's easy to make the jump from \"affinity\" to \"partial cause and effect\" (Persinger's theory would fit only some of the UFOs that Rutledge's group saw). For Rutledge, after his considerable investment of time and effort in his long investigation, and with his preference for the more conventional wisdom of the UFO movement, such a jump is understandably much more difficult. With all due respects to Dr. Rutledge, that's the tough road Persinger's theory faces. NOTES & REFERENCES 1.

Many MUFON members in the 'Southern California area (and some up North as well) have been busy for the past several months planning the 14th Annual MUFON Symposium which will be.held in Pasadena, Calif., \"the city of the roses,\" and we have not had much time to devote to other tasks. Pasadena has been my home for 26 years. It is a lovely city. To the west the San Rafael hills rise low and green. To the north, the San Gabriel Mountains jut into the sky. Beyond the San Gabriels, to the east and north of Pasadena, are the vast reaches of the Mohave Desert. Here lie archeplogical treasures beneath its sands, as well as mysterious, long- disused sacred sites of the numerous 1 Indian tribes which once roamed here , free. Some of these sites are in the Los Angeles area, as well. .  : , At this Symposium, I will speak on Southern California sightings, as well as doing my bit on the arrangements committee. Following our theme, \"UFOs: A Scientific Challenge,\" '\\ seized the opportunity to' present' Southland close encounters within the context of orthoteny, or, as Aime Michel first called it, \"the Straight-Line. Mystery.\" Researchers since 1954 have been UFO SIGHTING BY JOHN & DAVID DEHERRERA INFORMATION REQUESTED In the Fall of 1956 or 1957, there was an interesting UFO sighting in Colorado. Several people driving between Pueblo and Walsenberg observed this unidentified flying object traveling parallel to Highway 180. Approximately 80 miles further south, my younger brother and I also saw an unidentified flying object, possibly within a few minutes of the other sighting. It approached and crossed the highway directly over the pickup I was driving. It was daylight and the object was less than 100 feet away at the closest point. Now, 27 years later, I am trying to obtain a newspaper article that mentioned the Pueblo/Walsenberg sighting by several motorists. If anyone has a copy of this article, please contact me at the following address: John Deherrera, 417 N. Orange, Fullerton, CA 92633 12 , observing in different parts of the world, that UFO sightings occur along straight line patterns;' that is, the locations where UFOs are reported above or on the earth can, in many instances, be • connected by drawing, a straight line through those sites when plotted on maps. In the case of sightings far apart, these series of sighting locations can be connected by \"great circle\" segments, since a straight line drawn along a sphere becomes a segment of a circle arid not a true straight line. The . first known Southern California straight line was discovered accidentally in the 1970s during a totally .unrelated research study. The Symposium gave me a chance to research the straight-line phenomenon in depth; with quite interesting results. I am not a physical scientist but approached the subject with an objective attitude and honest sets of criteria and protocol. But the problem of the \"straight lines\" presents a special difficulty to some physical scientists, for close encounter cases are, mostly, anecdotal. In this area, we do not have a large number of landing trace cases, for example, such as exist in some states and other countries. So the data used in the study, except for two probably genuine photo cases, was subjective in every sense of the word. The problem of subjective vs. objective data has been hotly disputed since the beginnings of UFOlogy. Recently the question has been'boldly, approached in the pages of this Journal by such writers as Bill Leet. The crux of the problem is — how can subjective data fit into a \"hard science.\" Physical scientists are forced, by their very definition, to think that' UFOlogy must develop eventually into a hard science if it is ever to be accepted in academia. But the problem remains: (coninued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"California Report, Continued there is little hard data in UFOlogy. It is time to present some straight talk about the problem of subjective vs. objective data, for it affects the validity or non-validity of the \"straight-line\" phenomenon in Southern California. Sixteen straight lines were found in my study, lines which comprise 57 UFO-related events. In addition, there are 35 other sites, providing three comparison groups: ancient Indian ritual sites, paranormal incidents, and IFOs where the object sighted was in close proximity to the witness. All but one of these comparison sites lay along straight lines, giving an additional seven lines to the original sixteen. Why these 91 sites, related to such different types of incidents, can be connected by straight lines on the transverse mercator projection map of Southern California used in the study I cannot fathom. Perhaps other, more learned, minds can discover why, if any be intrigued enough to study the problem further. But these 23 straight lines constitute a confrontation between those who believe that only objective data is valid in UFOlogy and those who accept that subjective data is useful and valid, provided it comes from rational, honest witnesses. Some scientists can accept subjective anecdotal data as valid if it is both .quantitative and qualitatively significant, but cannot accept anecdotal data of paranormal events. They shy away from any suggestion that UFO events are often accompanied by paranormal incidents. Why, then, do the plotted paranormal events lie along the Southern California, \"straight lines\"? They had been expected to fall in random patterns. Except for three incidents which had occurred at the same site where UFO events also occurred, though on different dates, the content of all these paranormal cases was totally devoid of any UFOlogical significance. The field of psychic research, in the opinion of many scientists, is totally outside the realm of science. Yet groups like the Mobius Society and Stanford Research Institute are using scientific methodologies, utilizing psychically derived data, and are obtaining objective, verifiable results. Many UFO researchers are beginning to suspect that Truth may not be observable only on the physical level, that is, monitorable by instruments, but may also be observable on the mental and intuitional levels as well. Perhaps intuitional observations may be the means of grasping whole Truths. Scientists such as Edison and Einstein at times worked intuitionally and were later able to verify and demonstrate their work on a physical plane. Are UFOs manifesting (and contacting witnesses) on the mental and psychical planes as well as on the physical plane? If they are a teaching device, guiding mankind toward higher evolution, as researchers such as Vallee, Creighton, and Michel have suggested, then logically the evolution they are guiding would not be merely physical evolution but would be evolvement on the (higher) mental and (still higher) psychical planes. Most persons, scientists and non- scientists alike, inwardly accept that man is more than a material being living in a physical world. The true essence of a human being seems to be his/her mind, which cannot truly be measured by present-day instruments, and beyond mind, a life force which psychic researchers call elan vital. The elan vital of a human being seems to be able to perceive data beyond the confines of the physical space-time in which we live, as demonstrated by abilities such as telepathy, precogriition, and clairvoyance. It is possible for intuitional perceptions to be verified on an analytical, physical plane. The psychics utilized by Mobius, for instance, have their psychic input proven after the fact, when their predictions are verified by field investigation. In conclusion, I present for your consideration a psychic prediction which, according to internationally- known clairvoyant, Hamilton Farmer, will occur in conjunction with the 14th Annual Symposium. Hamilton and his wife Norma moved from Belfast, N. Ireland to Los Angeles last year, and he has been active in applied parapsychology projects in our Southland area. His following prediction is put in print as a challenge to those who do not believe that subjective or psychic data can be relied upon: On the evening of July 1,1983, around 10:00 o'clock in the evening, a Saturn-shaped object will hover over a portion of Los Angeles County and will be viewed by persons attending the MUFON Symposium social on that Friday evening at the Huntington-Sheraton Hotel. The object's apparent size will approximate the size of the full moon, and it will be seen for several minutes. It can be photographed and otherwise documented. Coincidentally, the Pasadena Huntington-Sheraton hotel is about midway between two junctions (multiple intersections) of the majority of straight lines in my study. One of these \"junctions\" is at an ancient sacred site, Eagle Rock, which rises majestically on the western edge of Pasadena. Farmer's unexpected prediction adds a bit of spice to our plans. It can also be regarded as a challenge to science. In the event the prediction is fulfilled, how will that affect the objective-subjective controversy? Could it serve to demonstrate to a significant number of UFOlogists that valid data (verified after the fact) can be derived from subjective and even psychic sources?

What are UFOs, and where do they come from? Sounds like a simple question, but it doesn't have a simple answer. When we are asked a \"what?\" question, our first tendency is to answer , with a dictionary-type definition. So, we would say, UFO, stands for unidentified flying object. .But that's not much help. Unidentified flying object is a confusing term for many reasons: 1. The word \"object\" makes it sound like a solid definite nuts-and- bolts kind of thing. But this eliminates from consideration meteorological and electromagnetic and other events that may look like solid objects, and that may account for some UFO reports. 2. \"Flying\" suggests that it's moving through the sky. But many UFOs are stationary, and some are oh or close to the ground. Also, \"flying\" seems to imply that the whatever-it-is is under conscious control, again making it more difficult to understand UFOs that may be natural events. 3. \"Unidentified\" refers to lack of information by the observer; it does not refer to any characteristic of the whatever-it-is. The original concept of \"unidentified flying object\" implied the accompanying idea of \"identified flying object\" — but this aspect seems to have disappeared from the common meaning. (Note I'm talking about how most people use the term, not about how someone thinks a word \"should\" be defined.) If you saw something in the sky you could not identify, and then learned later that what you saw was the planet Venus, you might at one time have said that you saw a UFO but later learned it was an IFO, Venus. In actual current usage, you would continue to term what you saw a UFO; people still say \"President Carter saw a UFO\" even though it has been pretty well 14 established that what he saw must have been Venus. Thus the term UFO, originally used . for those mysterious \"flying .saucers\" and \"discs\" seen in the sky, currently is used to label or describe a wide variety of events, unidentified as. well as known. The 'range ' of meaning in the . popular mind'is illustrated,by the huge difference in evaluation of UFOs in the library arid in the bookstore. In the library's. Dewey Decimal System, UFOs are seemingly solid, reputable objects — UFOs are in 629.279 along with aircraft, with the same number applied to.both, and books about UFOs and about airplanes intermingled. But in the bookstore (at least the ones I see) UFOs are down in the Occult section, along with past lives, the Bermuda Triangle, and similar exotica. Another curious categorization: UFOs are listed in both the New York Times index and in the major magazine index, but the new National Newspaper Index (a computerized listing of the NY Times, Wall Street Journal, and Christian Science Monitor), we are told under UFO to \"see Flying Saucers.\" I noted another interesting aspect of definition in Willard Nelson's article in the April MUFON Journal. He referred to something called a \"real UFO.\" I gather from the context he \"uses UFO in the broad sense discussed above, and uses \"real UFO\" to eliminate from consideration not only hoaxes, hallucinations, planets, weather balloons, and other such IFO- type events, but also any kind of natural/Persinger/Corliss sort of electromagnetic/meteorological/what- ever type of event that some observer might experience and classify as a UFO. This seems to jibe with the popular meaning of the term: it is possible for an opinion researcher to ask the question \"Do you believe in UFOs?\" and apparently get a yes or no answer from most people. The popular impression of that question seems (to my ( ear) something like \"Do you believe that there are some mysterious unknown objects flying around out there, possibly from outer space?\" (At least that's my impression; 'let me know if you understand a different popular meaning.) After having sufficiently muddied the question \"What are UFOs?,\" let me go on to the next .question: Where do they come from? : Since there is little in the UFO field that can be definitely proved or disproved, the differences of opinion are essentially differences of what probability each of us would assign to a particular phenomenon or event. The conventional wisdom of the UFO movement sees extraterrestrial spacecraft as a high probability. In recent years, with the continuing lack of specific hard evidence for the ETH, some have moved on to other and more exotic theories. The skeptical position on UFOs seems to be that they would all be explainable in conventional terms if only sufficient and clearer data were available; the Condon .report, for example, made this basic assumption and curtly dismissed its unexplained cases. Or, skeptics seem to hold, a substantial number of unexplained cases are simply hoaxes or hallucinations. My position between those extremes goes something like this: I tend to believe what people say they saw (watching out, of course, for ob- vious hoaxes and questionable claims) although not necessarily to agree with their interpretation of what they saw, and to seek out a natural explanation (continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"Critic's Corner, Continued rather than an extremely unlikely extraterrestrial one. This viewpoint, I think, is consistent with the basic rule of philosophy called the Principle of Parsimony, or Occam's Razor: that one should seek the simplest explanation that covers the facts. What sort of answer, then, do I propse to the question of solving the UFO enigma? An important part of the problem, I think, is right there in talking about \"the\" UFO enigma or \"the\" UFO problem. This sort of talk leads us to seek or presume a single explanation for all UFOs. But as I see it, there are many different sorts of events that are collected under the umbrella term UFO. Two main categories: 1. We assume that our knowledge of electricity and the weather and other events in the sky around us is sufficient. But I look to the Corliss collections, to the work on earth stress of Persinger and Brady, and to other such sources, to develop explanations for some of the events we term \"UFO.\" 2. We tend to believe what we see, or what we think we see; we tend to interpret something we've never seen before in terms of our experience, even though the events we're seeing now don't fit the earlier pattern. So I suspect that some \"UFOs\" involve problems of perception and interpretation. My emphasis on how we interpret what we see leads me, for example, to be wary of reports of \"lighted objects\" in the form of some common shape, \"cigar-shaped\" objects that have \"portholes,\" and any such sighting that exhibits a regularity and thus reflects what we expect. These sightings often cover only a few seconds, and in the surprise and shock of it we tend to not perceive as accurately as we would under more normal conditions. So I suspect some of those \"triangles\" and \"portholes\" and other such that people report are merely suggestive of such shapes and probably are irregular events that our perception process makes more regular. So part of my answer to \"Where do UFOs come from?\" is to point to my head, and to yours, and to suggest that we all inevitably create a reality in there SKEPTICISM ' Syndicated columnist George F. Will (Washington Posf, May 15, 1983) devoted a column to skepticism about the Loch Ness \"monster\" which applies equally well to UFOs. After briefly reviewing scientific ideas that we accept (particle and wave theories of matter, floating continents, the DNA code...) he notes: \"But it is generally considered beneath serious consideration that a large creature lives in Loch Ness.\" Will cites the Nessie observations, photographic and sonar evidence, and conclusions by reputable scientists that Nessie may be real. He then concludes, in part: \"Perhaps [the evidence] can be explained (as has been suggested) in terms of mass suggestion, or a sunken Viking ship, or clouds of gas bubbles, or floating trash, or a decaying stag's head. \"But it is curious the amount of faith sometimes needed, and sometimes forthcoming, to maintain a particular skepticism.... the number of ideas people are willing to entertain in order to avoid entertaining one idea that is considered naive or otherwise out of place in polite society.\" No great philosophies or theories will be undone if it turns out that Nessie is real, he observes, \"But many persons close their minds against -many thoughts in order to avoid being thought insufficiently skeptical.... skepticism can be a kind of dogmatic slumber, and the world has much to lose from an atrophied capacity for wonder and surprise. Certainly the history of science in this century should serve as a warning against a narrow notion of the possible.\" ' The analogy to attitudes about UFOs is imperfect in that certain philosophies and theories might be shaken by final proof that UFOs are real — depending ori what they turn out to be. But the skepticism itself is of exactly the same kind as that shown toward Nessie and is no more justified in application to UFOs. Will seems to have put his finger on which sometimes reflects partly what's already in there rather than just what's going on around us. at least part of the dynamics of scientific skepticism toward \"popular mysteries\": the mysteries are popular, and no self-respecting scientist wants to be considered naive or \"insufficiently skeptical,\" so he/she debunks even the most convincing of observational and scientific evidence as being only part of a \"popular fad.\" And so, UFO reports are written off as \"mass suggestion,\" \"gas bubbles\" (!), and geological lights conveniently endowed with the ability to \"cloud men's minds\" (a la the Shadow of radio fame) in order to account for the Travis Walton \"abduction\" case and, by implication, other cases involving \"unacceptable\" story content. Oh; the ideas that skeptics are willing to entertain to avoid being out of step with \"Science.\" - Editor. MUFON 103 OLDTOWNE RD.

Mallove, Sc. D. (MUFON Consultant) The existence of advanced extra- terrestrial, civilizations somewhere in our Milky Way galaxy is taken almost as a given' by the scientific community today. There is, however, not a shred of widely accepted scientific evidence to confirm this opinion. Plausible train of arguments leading to a populated galaxy, yes — hard evidence of extraterrestrials, no. Unlikely as this seems, we just might be the only civilization in the galaxy, if not in fact in the entire universe. The only way to prove' that we are not alone is to produce indisputable evidence of extra- terrestrials. We live on a relatively young planet, roughly 5 billion years old, in a universe that may be 20 billion years old. This fact gives room for speculation that civilizations having arisen much earlier in the universe would by ,now possess a technology so advanced that it would border on \"magical.\" The argument made by some is that certainly these societies would long since have colonized or visited every cosmic neighborhood. In short, there should be some compelling evidence of an extraterrestrial presence here and now. Or should there be? A few members of the scientific community have concluded that since there is no clear evidence of alien life on or. near earth, perhaps humanity is alone in the universe. The argument is that \"absence of evidence is evidence of absence.\" Of course, the many dedicated technical and lay people who study reports of unidentified flying objects (UFOs) would be the first to disagree. To them, there is at least a chance that in the tangled morass of bizarre UFO case histories lurks the signal amidst the noise to tell us that aliens are here and flitting about in strange spacecraft. Assuming that advanced technical societies exist somewhere .beyond Earth, the key to whether they were, are, or will be here has to do with 16 overcoming the vast distances between the stars. Interstellar distances are typically trillions of miles and our puny chemically propelled rockets would take tens to hundreds of thousands of years just to reach the nearer, stars. Even now we can propose technology based on known physical principles which would reduce interstellar travel times to only tens or hundreds of years. Some of these advanced starship designs rely on thermonuclear reactions, the fire of stars, while other designs 1 envision microthin metal sails. which are blown by starlight pressure alone from star, to star. It is clear that if we wish to go to the stars \"slowly,\" the technology to do so is just around the corner. Think of how much faster very advanced civilizations may be able to accomplish interstellar transport if we primitives already have the slow boat! It is hard for any scientist to envision starships that could violate the speed of light barrier of relativity theory — this wall is not likely to be breached because its position in the pyramid of physics is basic and secure. So starships from any culture will be limited to speeds below 186,000 miles per second, or several years between typical stars. The faster starships travel, also the more energy required to accelerate them and then to decelerate . at the destination. To travel anywhere close to light speed, or even at substantial fractions of light speed, requires vast expenditure of energy. Though it can be done it might be extravagant use of resources even for advanced civilizations in command of vast stores of energy. Since the energy barrier of light speed does constrain casual interstellar flight at high speed, perhaps we shouldn't expect to see aliens all over the place. Quite frankly they may just not care to physically explore every nook and cranny of the universe. Alien societies may be introverted, quite content to keep to themselves after some initial testing of the interstellar waters. Ift they : have any interest in exploring the cosmos beyond their local stellar neighborhood, they may do so by signalling their 1 presence with radio or microwave beacons, hoping to receive messages on conditions elsewhere. It has been shown theoretically time and again that signalling by electromagnetic radiation is by far the least expensive form of interstellar contact — given that cooperative receiving societies exist. Microwave communication between advanced societies may have led to a \"galactic club\" of communicating societies which we may soon join. Even now sensitive radio telescopes on Earth combined with computers to scan many frequency channels at once, peer out at the universe in an attempt to listen for our cosmic kin. It may be a long search for precisely the correct direction and frequency, but if deliberately beamed signals are coming from afar, a persistent search will eventually recognize them. We should not expect to see alien starships in our skies, nice as it would be to find them. This does not rule out that UFOs are some manifestation of alien civilization. The bizarre, intangible character of the UFO show may be the extraterrestrials' way of beginning their dialogue with us. On the other hand the UFO phenomenon may be nothing more than misinterpretation of known or yet unknown physical events, unguided by alien minds. Research into UFO cases is worthwhile if only to find out why normal people report strange things. Perhaps the residue of good cases, high in strangeness and resistant to conventional explanation, will yield insight into new natural phenomena or even the hoped for contact with aliens. On a parallel front, radio- astronomers are beginning in earnest (continued on page 18)"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"Director's Message, from p. 20 at the popularity of the program and the vast listening audience. Since it was not feasible for everyone to attend the 1983 MUFON UFO Symposium, we will publicize the dates and locations of up-coming conferences that may be more convenient to our members because of transportation costs. Dan Lowenski, Host Chairman, and Peter Mazzola, International Director, have announced their forthcoming 1983 SBI UFO Symposium to be held August 12, 13, and 14, at the Ramada Inn, 1228 Western Avenue, Albany, NY 12203, telephone (518) 489-2981. Hotel reservations should be made directly with the Ramada Inn. The special group rate is $32.00 per day for single occupancy and $37.00 per day for double occupancy. Individual admission to each of the five sessions is $6.00; however, a special package price for the entire symposium is $25.00. All advanced ticket payments should be mailed to The SBI, P.O.

Michael Sinclair, International Coordinator, will be MUFON's representative to the PICUR session. The following nations are now affiliated or associated with PICUR: Belgium, Germany, Norway, Switzerland, Canada (UFOCAN), Italy, Portugal, United Kingdom, Denmark, Korea, Spain, France, Netherlands, Sweden, USA (CUFOS & MUFON), and Yugoslavia. The Mutual UFO Network will co sponsor with the University of Nebraska in Lincoln a three-day conference on the subject of \"Exploring Unexplained Phenomena\" in Lincoln, Nebraska, on November 11,12, and 13, 1983. Confirmed speakers are John F. Schuessler, Dr. J. Allen Hynek, Budd Hopkins, Larry Fawcett, Linda Moulton Howe, Tom Adams, Roy Mackal, Loren Coleman, and Larry Arnold. Tentative admission price for the three days has been set at $50.00. Ray W. Boeche, MUFON State Director for Nebraska, is the chairperson for the conference. On May 12, 13, and 14, we were honored to have Dipl.-Phys. Illobrand von Ludwiger, Director (Coordinator) for the Mutual UFO Network - Central European Section (MUFON-CES) from Feldkirchen-Westerham (near Munich), Germany, as our guest. It was a distinct pleasure to share UFO experiences with Illobrand and to personally obtain a greater insight into the goals, objectives, and philosophy of the scientists, engineers, and academics who are member of this elite group. Each year they also sponsor a UFO conference with attendance by invitation and publish their papers in the German language. They are now preparing their MUFONCES Report No. 9 with contributions by the following researchers with subject titles: \"The Handling of UFO Reports by Science Journalists and the Hidden Facts of UFOs\" by I.

Their next UFO Conference will be held in October 1983 in Munich, Germany. During his visit to the United States, Illobrand had the opportunity to see the sights of Los Angeles, San Francisco, and San Antonio. On May 22nd, a telephone conference call between the members of the North American UFO Federation (NAUFOF) Steering Committee was conducted to resolve details in the proposed bylaws, answer questions, and to complete tabulation of the votes for the people nominated for the initial Board of Directors by the members of the steering committee. The candidates were later contacted by telephone to obtain a written commitment .if they agreed to be one of the nine board members. The people with the most votes were contacted first, followed by those with fewer votes, until the nine positions were filled. At the initial Board of Directors meeting in Pasadena, Calif., on July 4th, the directors will be publicly announced, officers elected, and bylaws approved for establishing this 18 cooperative nonprofit federation of UFO groups in North America! The cooperation displayed and the positive attitudes reflected by the steering committee members is substantial evidence that the NAUFOF will be successful and signals a giant step forward in unification of groups with.., many divergent ideologies. John Schuessler must be commended for his leadership as chairmamof the steering . committee and his diplomacy in resolving difficult problems. Berthold E. Schwartz, M.D., a MUFON Consultant in Psychiatry, has authored a set of two deluxe trade, soft-. cover books titled UFO Dynamics, Book I and Book II with the sub-title ( Psychiatric and Psychic Aspects of the UFO Syndrome (first edition May 1983).

Mark Langford, United Press International (UPI) Bureau Chief in San Antonio, Texas, released an interview with Walter Andrus, dateline Seguin, Texas, to their wire services in North America on April 24, 1983, to be used on May 1st or thereafter. It was published verbatim in many newspapers except with a customized headline. Several newspapers called for telephone interviews, not only to supplement the story with additional material, but also to incorporate local MUFON people and UFO sightings. To date we have clippings of the published news release from the following newspapers: Albuquerque Tribune (New Mexico), San Francisco Examiner and Chronicle (California), Bay City Times (Michigan), Seattle Post-Intelligencer (Washington), Reading Eagle (Pennsylvania), Houston Chronicle (Texas), Albuquerque Journal (New Mexico), Texarkana Gazette (Texas and Arkansas), and several with multiple articles after personal interviews. Inquiries have been received from coast to coast by interested people after reading the articles in their local newspaper. Ms. Kristin Gazley, Bureau Chief for Associated Press (AP) in San Antonio, also plans to conduct an interview and subsequent news release to their worldwide outlets. The widespread publication of the UPI interview additionally sparked radio talk shows on CFPL in London, Ontario, Canada with Wayne McClain; KTOK in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma moderated by Bill Fountain; and WOAI in San Antonio, Texas hosted by Alan Dale.
