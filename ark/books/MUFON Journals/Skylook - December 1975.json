Short Editor-Publisher Emeritus Editor's Column A tentative meeting which the Cen- ter for UFO Studies is attempting to set up in April, reportedly in an effort to assess \"the state of UFO research,\" has had some very undesirable side effects. The basic problem is a list of 138 persons selected for what Dr. J. Allen Hynek now says is only the first of what is hoped to be a series of such meetings for qualified persons. What are the criteria laid down by Dr. Hynek for participation? Says Dr. Hynek, the meeting is to be \"attended only by persons with an established record of serious work conducted with an open minded scien- tific attitude. To be more explicit, this should include only those who have seriously investigated and re- ported on many UFO cases in the field, and those who have written seriously on the subject, again, in an unprejudiced manner.\" For those selected, there must be at least a temporary feeling of honor. For those omitted from the magic list there is bound to be disappoint- ment and hurt feelings. Most people who investigate and write about UFOs like to feel that they are ser- ious and unprejudiced—yet many \"regulars\" have been left off the list. While Dr. Hynek did leave the door open a bit for additions to his initial list, he said that \"in making such suggestions I would ask that you hold firmly in mind the strict criteria for inclusion, i.e. that attendees have a demonstrated track record.\" The implication and expectation is that the person with a demonstrated track record would already be known—and included. Besides, no one wants to be a second round choice. The actual criteria used by Dr. Hynek remains a mystery when one looks at the strange mixture of back- grounds and levels of expertise of those on the list. Since sending out the list, Dr. Hynek has informed me that he has had some second thoughts concerning who should have been included and excluded. Both the list and the meeting were meant to be secret, but the list and other information was sent to all 138 persons on the invitation list. It is unbelievably naive for Dr. Hynek to believe that he can send out 138 letters and expect either the meeting or the list of participants to remain secret, as he requested. Al- ready, copies of his letter are being Xeroxed and passed around. It is, quite naturally, big news when the best-known name in UFOs selects 138 individuals for his personal, secret UFO conference. What can we in the field learn from this? First, if a select group of scientists or investigators or whatever are to be brought together, more care should be exercised in drawing up the list of participants. Secondly, it is quite possible to have a private meeting without attempting to make it secret. In a field where investigators and organizations are almost paranoid in their suspicions of each other, attempted secrecy only makes matters worse. Perhaps a meeting to ascertain \"the state of UFO research\" is not needed. Possibly the question has al- ready been answered. The state of UFO research is obviously in a mess when the best-known person in the field cannot come up with a reason- able list of participants to discuss the question.

WITNESSES: Seven forestry work- ers. TYPE OF CASE: lighted object, light beam, abduction. CONDITIONS: clear sky, excellent visibility, no unusual weather condi- tions, temperature of 50 degrees, rela- tive humidity of 12%, dusk, moon not visible, sun setting in west, Jupiter visible. The alleged sighting of a UFO by seven forestry workers and the claimed abduction of one of them, Travis Walton, 22, from a national forest near Heber, AZ, on Nov. 5 is accepted as factual by some UFO researchers, but others are some- what skeptical. Early in the case, Bill Spaulding of MUFON and Ground Saucer Watch was quoted as saying, \"We found some interesting things up there. If it is a hoax it's one of the best\" I've ever seen.\" Later, however, Spaulding indicated that lack of cooperation from Walton and other factors caused him to question at least some aspects, of the case. Ray Jordan, investigator for NICAP, was quoted in the Nov. 11 ARIZONA REPUBLIC as saying, \"I haven't found anything in their stories to indicate a hoax. The young men I've interviewed so far are all visibly shaken by the experience. I'm in- clined to believe they're telling the truth.\" Coral Lorenzen of APRO, who is reportedly preparing another book on humanoids, is quoted by the Chicago Tribune as saying, \"From the evi- dence at hand we don't see how any hoax could have been perpetrated. We are convinced that something quite bizarre happened to Travis.\" She added that details provided by Walton under hypnosis \"match unpublished descriptions we have received from other persons who have had similar experiences.\" HcbeK R Xv^Lt«>x kP-e.SeHrtl'llftY The X indicates where Travis Walton was allegedly struck by a blue ray of light from a UFO in view of six other forestry workers. The Sighting ; According to the Knight News Wire, Walton and six fellow forestry work- ers were traveling in a double cab truck (four in the back seat, three in the front seat) when they first saw the object. Michael Rogers, 28, fore- man of the group, is quoted as saying that they \"spotted this thing in a clearing about 25 yards from the road. It looked like two pie pans, one upside down, hovering about 15 feet above the ground.\" Rogers reportedly said that the object \"was about 15 feet in diameter, about 8 feet high, and it had some markings, but they were too compli- cated to describe. It was glowing all over—a yellowish white. It was twi- light when we saw it, and it seemed to light up the area. I'd never seen any- thing like it before.\" Another of the witnesses, Duane Smith, 19, is quoted as saying that the object was a bright silver and seemed to glow. Rogers said Walton jumped from the truck and ran toward the UFO when a bluish light shot from the UFO and Walton fell. At that point, said Rogers, \"We all panicked and drove off. When we came back about 15 minutes later, Travis was gone and there was no sign of the UFO.\" Spaulding's Nov. 13 preliminary report of the incident included de- scriptions similar to those quoted by the Knight News Service. In Spauld- ing's report, which is based on infor- mation from Walton and all six wit- nesses, the object is described as a solid metallic disc which was bright- er than the moon or brightest star, hovering 20-22 feet above the ground, illuminated as brilliant white—then a blue flash. Sound coming from the object was described as \"electrical- high and low pitch.\" Spaulding's report notes that the object was not observed moving dur- ing the sighting, did not change shape, did not change coloring (exceot for the blue light), did not leave vapor or smoke, did not disappear and re- appear, did not rotate, did not flutter or vibrate, but did wobble. No landing was observed by the witnesses. The observers were traveling due west at 3-5 mph when the object was observed about 90-100 feet to the nrserved about 90-100 feet to the north, hovering over a wood pile. It is not known whether there were air- craft in the vicinity at the time of the sighting. The blue flash which purportedly hit Walton was 18-24 inches wide, ac-"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"A Sketch by Duane Smith, one of the witnesses to the UFO sighting. cording to the witnesses who alleged- ly saw it (Smith is quoted in one newspaper as saying he did not actually see the blue light, but.only heard one of the others say, \"It got him.\") Walton was reportedly 10-15 feet short of being under the object when hit by the blue beam of light. One of the witnesses, Kenneth Peter- son, 25, was quoted by the Associated Press as saying that the light beam \"kind of lifted him up off the ground. His arms were outstretched and he was knocked to the ground.\" The Disappearance The .six forestry workers reported- ly could not find Walton when they returned .to the scene of the sighting after .overcoming their initial fears. Navajo County Sheriff Marlin Gilles- pie was notified, and a ground search, aided by a helicopter, was conducted without Walton being located. - All six of the witnesses to Walton's disappearance voluntarily took lie detector (polygraph) tests conducted by the Arizona Department of Public Safety. It indicated that five of the witnesses .(Rogers, Smith, Steve Pierce, John Goulette, and Peterson) were telling the truth, according to Sheriff Gil'lespie. The test on the sixth witness (Allen Dalis, 21) was termed inconclusive because the witness was extremely agitated. The polygraph operator has been quoted in the ARIZONA REPUBLIC as saying that the lie detector is 97 percent accurate and that it is im- possible for that, many people to be lying. . :. Undersheriff Kenneth Coplan noted, however, that Walton and the other forestry workers had seen the Oct. 20 NBC special, \"The UFO Incident\" which described Betty and Barney Hill being taken aboard a UFO, and suggested that some aspects of the two cases were similar. Sheriff Gillespie initially said that the witnesses were consistent in their __ accounts of the experience, and that he was convinced that they had not .used intoxicants or drugs on the night of'the alleged sighting. Mrs. Lorenzen said the witnesses were asked to draw pictures of the craft independently \"and all the pictures match.\" Five days after the apparent abduc- tion, and prior to the return of Walton, his mother, Mrs. Mary Kellett, was quoted by anoother son, Duane, as say- ing that she believed her son was taken on board the craft and that further searching for her son would j be pointless. Mrs. Kellett reportedly had a reputation in Snowflake, AZ, where she resides, as an outspoken believer in UFO's. The Reappearance Travis Walton reappeared on Nov. 10, five days after the initial sighting. The Arizona Republic reported that Travis called his brother-in-law, Grant Neff. about midnight on Nov. 10 from a phone booth, according to Duane's wife Carol. Travis reportedly told Neff that he had been returned to Earth outside of Heber and said, \"I need help and I'm hurting. Get Duane down here.\" Neff reportedly then contacted _ Duane, who was staying with his mother, .Mrs. Kellett. Neff and Duane then went to pick up Travis. Travis reportedly looked exhausted, was confused, and had a heavy growth of beard when he was found in the - phone booth. He complained of \"tre- mendous pain\" in the chest and head, attributing this to tests performed on him while he was on board theJJFO. Duane and Carol drove Travis to > their home in Glendale, where Travis ate some cottage cheese, but then said he felt ill. Travis reportedly ex- j pressed surprise when told he had been missing for five days, saying he had been conscious only about two hours of the time he had been gone. Duane said, according to the Ari- zona Republic, that he took Travis to a private hospital in Tucson, where Travis was given a thorough physical exam, including a brain wave test, a blood test, and urinalysis. The results of these tests are apparently not available. Carol Walton reported that Travis had a pin-prick wound on his arm 4"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Travis Walton before his alleged '.f experience with 3/'a.UFO. resembling the mark' left by an injec- tion, but Duane said Carol was mis- taken and that Travis had no marks of any kind oh his body. Duane said Travis was in good health. Undersheriff Coplan reported on Nov. 12 that Sheriff Gillespie had talked with-Travis at an, undisclosed location in Phoenix and .that Travis , had told the sheriff that he had been examined by a doctor, but had not entered a hospital as previously re- ported. Sheriff Gillespie also reported that Travis had told him he did not remember the blue light which re- portedly came from the UFO, and that he thought he had been hit on-the head at the time of \"the alleged abduc- tion! Aboard a UFO? . Travis reportedly told Sheriff Gil- lespie that he had awakened on an examination table aboard the UFO, and that he was checked by three weird-looking beings. According to an .Associated Press story, Duane had quoted Travis as saying he had seen \"two humanoids and others who were hot human\" aboard the craft. Duane is-quoted in the Nov. 12 ' Phoenix Gazette as saying . that Travis \"encountered two kinds of creatures, one human, one almost human. He saw four different kinds of craft.\" The Chicago Tribune quoted Travis as sgyirig he had been examined by hairless beings in tight-fitting blue. clothing in a white room. The Knight News Service quoted Travis as saying \"several\" strange-looking creatures examined him. , . Deputy Sheriff Ken Nolan, who obtained his information from Sheriff Gillespie, gave this version to The Arizona Republic: Travis was ex- amined on board the UFO by strange- looking occupants in what appeared to be a hospital. The people who ex- aminee him were dressed in tight- fitting blue coveralls. They had no visible hair. Travis tried unsuccess- fully to converse with the occupants, but the occupants made no - sound. When he tried to get up the occupants tried to hold him down and he '.'took- a swing\" at one of them. The crea- tures then left the room. Walton then got up, according to Nolan, and went into another room, which contained a chair. He sat in the chair and pushed buttons on the arms of the chair. The ceiling slid back and he could see stars going by. A crea- ture entered the room wearing a hel- met that looked, like an upside down fish bowl. The occupant smiled, but said nothing, escorting him by the arm to a large auditorium-like room where he saw a spacecraft parked. A device like an oxygen mask was. then placed on Travis' face by people who had long hair, according to Nolan, and the next thing Travis re- membered was lying on the pavement '/i mile from Heber on the Payson- Heber highway. Travis reportedly said .a device which had been placed on his chest during the examination was knocked - to the floor when he struggled to get up. Sheriff Gillespie reportedly came away from his interview with Travis \"less convinced than before\" that the story -was authentic. . Undersheriff Coplan said he \"move than ever\" be- lieves the abduction is a hoax. \"It's just too much, to buy,\" said Coplan. t Famed psychic Peter Hurkos. was quoted in -the Phoenix Gazette as say- ing, \"It's a hoax. I believe thefe are unidentified flying objects; in fact; the government is aware of these. But this. one is a hoax. Someone's fantasy.\" 7 . The Investigation '. Spaulding's Ground Saucer Watch personnel interviewed-Travis on Nov. 11 at GSW headquarters for GSW and MUFON and reportedly found some discrepencies in the story. Spaiilding said Duane took his brother away from GSW and \"accused us of being negative after we- questioned him about a couple of holes in the story. In the first place, this is not the way abduction victims go about things. We have, many studies of past abductions and this doesn't f9llow.\"  : '~ Spaiilding, who found \"high residual magnetism\" at the location'-of the alleged sighting, was qupted in the Nov. 12 Phoeniz Gazette as : saying he believed the seven witnesses did see a UFO. He said, however, that \"there are some questions related to the so-"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"called abduction.\" Duane reacted sharply to Spauld- ing's doubts, calling Spaulding a publicity seeker. A scheduled Inter- view of Travis by Dr. J. Allen Hynek, of the Center for UFO Studies, ar- ranged by Spaulding, was cancelled BY THE \\Yaltons, reportedly because Travis ..was \"not ready yet.\" Travis also failed to show for a police poly- graph test scheduled for Nov. 14. However, investigators ,and con- sultants from APRQ who examined Travis are quoted by the Knight News Service as saying they are convinced the story is not a hoax. An APRO physhiatrist, Dr. Gene Rosenbaum, says he and others performed \"a com- prehensive battery of psychiatric and medical exams\" on Travis. Dr. Rosen- baum said in a press release that \"our conclusion, which was absolute, is* that this young man is not lying, that there is no collusion involved. The results of psychiatric tests and hypno- sis show he really believes these things, that he is not lying.\" Dr. James Harder, APRO's research director from the University of California, who has experience in hypnosis, also examined Travis. According to Rosenbaum, urinaly- sis and blood tests indicated that Travis was not a drug user. Characters Travis and Duane Walton were out- spoken believers in UFOs prior to the sighting, as was their mother, Mrs. Kellett. Duane is quoted in the Nov. 12 Arizona Republic as saying that in the past 12 years he and .Travis have seen 12 to 14 UFOs and that \"five or six were just as definite as anything you could imagine.\" Duane said that he and Travis had talked a number of times about UFOs and once formed a pact that if one of them was taken aboard a UFO that he would try to return for the other. Duane said, However, that there had been no contact of any kind between him and Travis while Travis was on board the UFO.  : Duane, who shoes horses and at- tends college, reportedly told an Ari- zona Republic reporter just prior to Travis' reappearance that he was not concerned about the fate of his broth- er. \"He's having the experience of a lifetime,\" said Duane, who added that his mother was also convinced Travis had been taken aborad a UFO. At one point, however, Duane criticized one of the UFO investigators for saying, prior to Travis' reappearance, that abductions usually do not last very long. \"That sure didn't help my mother any,\" said Diiane. Also prior to the reappearance of Travis, Deputy Glen Flake expressed doubts concerning the story. \"Our gen- eral feeling is that they're making up a big story,\" said Flake, noting that the six witnesses had discussed UFOs with Travis earlier, and that Travis had reportedly expressed a desire \"to make contact\" with a craft. Conclusions Because of inconsistent factors, it is impossible to determine whether the case is authentic or a hoax.

Director, Ground Saucer Watch (GSW) Western Division . At 10:23 p.m. on Aug. 17, 1975, a Joint Use Area Patrol officer in Keams Canyon, AZ, (60 miles north of Holbrook) observed a brilliant white light, from behind his patrol vehicle, that completely enveloped his immediate area. Immediately the witness slowed his vehicle and turned to see a red and green rotating light on an obscured dark shape. The bright white spot light was also visible. Getting out of the patrol van, all three lights went out and there was total darkness. The officer, who wishes anonymity, continued on his patrol. After driving for 3 to 4 minutes, his vehicle, a 1970 Ford Bronco, exper- ienced total EME (electro magnetic effects). The patrol van lost its lights, engine and even the communications. The-loss of all the Bronco's electrical systems lasted approximately thirty to forty seconds. Then suddenly the vehicle's lights came on and the engine started. The officer reported the experience to headquarters, which is part of the official police record. This was not the only UFO encount- er that evening. Approximately thirty miles to the north, another patrol spotted six unidentified flying objects exactly 25 minutes after the EME en- counter. Three officers reported two similar appearing objects, with rotat- ing red and green lights and a bright white spot light in the middle. The UFOs were transversing at a low altitude, and streaked away with- in a few minutes. Then suddenly four additional objects were sighted hover- ing in a rectangular formation, sep- arated by 12 to 15 celestial degrees. The objects, flashing red, green and white, were flying at 5000 feet and were visible in the direction of the initial EME encounter. Later that evening in Tuba City, AZ additional UFOs were reported by both concerned citizens and police officers. Two separate incidents in- volved brilliant colored objects trav-"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"eling at tremendous speeds. Investigations GSW was initially contacted by the 26th Air Division of NORAD regard- ing the sighting, then the officers from Keams Canyon. Due to the.dis- tance, 300 miles one way, a com- pounded problem of half of our Arizo- na FI's were on vacation and the numerous other UFO sightings occur- ring, in the southwest, the investiga- tion was not conducted until Aug. 23. 1975. A four-member team headed by David Bates, conducted a five-hour investigation which included inter- viewing the prime witnesses, survey- ing the vehicle with magnometers and gauss equipment, and collecting soil samples by a suspect GM (ground marking) area. The EME survey report reveals higher residual magnetic readings near the back and roof of the Bronco, supporting strongly the officer's re- port. Our FI's completely checked the engine and its supporting electrical system and found no evidence of burnt wires, loose connections, nor a single \"failed\" or faulty component. The EME experienced could not be attributed to a normal breakdown. The GM area revealed strange- appearing burnt scrub/trees. A con- trol and test sample was taken and is currently being analyzed by an independent laboratory. The results are pending. The witnesses were extremely articulate and considered trained observers. Additionally they were very knowledgable of the area. Results A complete check was made with the AFB's: Luke in Arizona and Hoi- loman in New Mexico. They both re- ported to GSW and the Joint Use Area Patrol that no aircraft or special aerial missions were in progress that evening. The profile of the sightings does not lend itself to natural or celestrial . phenomena! Additionally ruled out were weather balloons, birds, space decay, objects, or any White Sands rocket launchings. GSW fully believes all the officers experienced bonafied UFO sightings, and as our testing data is processed it is expected that this will sub- stantiate this belief. Wisconsin sightings reported These photos were reportedly taken by a sheriff's deputy near Fennimore, Wl, on Nov. 4, 1975. The photos are allegedly of a large bright light seen in the sky at the west edge of the city. Lee Mehciz, an investigator for the Center for UFO Studies, is quoted as saying that the photos show a \"typical UFO flying pattern, banking from side to side.\" However, the photos have not yet been analyzed. This reported sighting was one of several in Grant County, Wl. Farmer Harold Fasten of Patch Grove reported a \"ball of fire\" hover- ing on top of a hill, lighting up an entire valley about 8 p.m. on Nov. 6. Following this report, other alleged witnesses said they, had also seen unidentifiable lights near Posten's farm. On the morning of Nov. 4 a 500-pound Holstein was found near Patch Grove with its left ear and tongue cut off by a sharp instrument. A veterinarian said the cow had died of pneumonia and \"the cuts were probably made after death, because there wasn't much blood around it.\" The .vet said something may have frightened the cow and caused it to run \"an it developed emphysema in its lung.\" Al- though cattle mutilations and UFO sightings are sometimes reported in the same general areas and in the same general time periods, most UFO investigators feel at this time that no definite connection has been established."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"California report NOTE: In this issue, SKYLOOK be- gins a continuing column from South- ern California. The authors, both MUFON investigators and members of SKYNET, a UFO filter and-track- ing system, are in touch with many other MU- FON personnel in that area. The sheer volume of sighting reports from California provides a rich field for corre- lative reporting. Ann Druffel has been actively en- gaged in UFO research and field in- vestigation for eighteen years. Her specialization is correlative research from varied sources. She has been Project Coordinator of SKYNET since its beginnings in 1965. Richard Zimmerman is an editor and free-lance writer. He has re- searched UFOs for the past five years. Specializing in correlative material, at present he is studying possible patterns in UFO sightings in the Los Angeles Basin. By Ann Druffel When the Air Force slammed shut the doors of Project Blue Book in December, 1969, it advised the public to report UFO sightings to their local police. Although Blue Book's demise was no great loss to the field, re- searchers groaned inwardly at the advice to \"report to the police.\" Experienced UFO investigators were aware that local law enforcement of- ficials, in general, had neither the time nor the ability to separate UFO \"wheat\" from \"chaff.\" Police and UFOs For several years following the 1969 AF suggestion, UFO witnesses tried repeatedly to refer their sight- ings to their local police and sheriff Police and UFOs stations. Their reports were invari- ably met with ridicule or disinterest. It was not until the organization of Dr. J. Allen Hynek's CUFOS that police departments throughout the country became fully aware.of ways in which sighting reports could be effectively handled. Even before CUFOS' entry into the research field, individual policemen throughout Southern California, and in other states, had begun tentative cooperation with local UFO groups. An effective link was set up with MUFON's Southern California track- ing arm, SKYNET, on January 28, 1974. It linked the Van Nuys Police Emergency Board, which covers the vast San Fernando Valley, with trained MUFON investigative per- sonnel. The San Fernando Valley, part of Los Angeles proper, is a giant, heavily settled complex covering more than 250 square miles. Its law enforcement needs are mainly served by the Los Angeles Police Depart- ment. Through the instigation of Offi- cer Maurice Allen of LAPD, SKYNET became the recipient of UFO reports direct from Valley citizens. Rick Zimmerman, in particular, has given of his energy and talents in receiving this influx of calls. Re- searchers desiring to collect data in this manner should be warned that the volume of reports, especially in the early A.M., can try the patience of the most avid investigator! A New Attitude Contrasting this cooperative police attitude with former days, we can see a vast difference. During an im- portant and intriguing series of events on Feb. 5-6,1960, several mem- bers of the LAPD were witnesses to a dramatic sighting. Although indi- vidual policemen willingly gave state- ments to veteran researchers Idabel Epperson and Marilyn Epperson, at police headquarters they were met with an official cold and cautious atti- tude. Nowadays the opposite situation exists. Individual LAPD helicopter pilots have indicated that puzzling, long-lived sightings might be checked out by their surveillance craft. < Some policemen, too, have come ' forward in recent months to report personal sightings to MUFON. One ., particular case concerned Jack Thompson, member of the LAPD, and Mrs. Thompson. In the summer of 1968, date un- certain, the couple were traveling north along Highway 99 on their way to a fishing trip in Oregon. About mid- night they passed through the tiny Northern California community of Ripon, about 75 miles southeast of San Francisco. Three bright white lights were viewed pacing their camper, periodically appearing and disappearing. Presently only one light was in view. It suddenly \"turned around\" and headed toward them. A huge shape loomed into view, sending a steady, bluish-green beam toward the ground. The off-duty policeman leaped from his camper as the lighted object con- tinued toward them. Deliberately, with an odd, whistling sound, a huge, tri-shaped object passed the camper not more than 100 feet behind and at an estimated 200-300 feet altitude. It J was about 55 degrees up from the horizon, moving from east to west. . The object's bulk subtended an arc :» of 20-30 degrees. Thompson estimated it to be 40-50 feet long, \"like a DC-10 going over practically overhead.\" A Beam of Light It was shooting out a sharply defined beam of bright, bluish-green light which reached the ground, cov- ering an area of 30-40 feet diameter. The cone-shaped beam was emanat- ing from a distinct aperture in the bottom of the craft. Thompson's sketch and verbal statement describes an object with a 8"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"central cigar-shaped \"fuselage,\" with two \"nacelles\" on either side, also cigar-shaped. He saw no connecting links between the central part and the smaller complementary objects — no wings or tail. Since the vivid light beam did not light up the solid por- tions above it, the details of their shapes were not sharply defined. It is possible that the \"craft\" could have been three individual'pbjects, remem- bering the three lights which had paced the T's camper for several minutes before the dramatic sweep across the highway. After crossing the road, the ob- jects) abruptly disappeared by turn- ing out the : central bluish-green beam. Duration of the close-encounter phase of the .sighting was about two min- utes. No interference with the camp- er's electrical system was noticed, nor any,, physical effects reported by the Thompsons. Puzzled, they, continued their jour- ney, contacting residents of the area on the\" camper's CB radio. None of the persons contacted had any knowledge of the mysterious craft. By 2:00 a.m. the couple reached Roseville, some eighty miles north, and pulled off into an isolated rest stop north of town. Sometime after 2:45 a.m., Mrs. Thompson was awak- ened by a loud whirring-whistling noise, seemingly coming from out- side. She opened the camper's roof vent, recognizing the same peculiar sound which had accompanied the object's low pass some hours earlier. An Indistinct Shape There was only darkness in the sky above, as seen through the vent, but Mrs. T. had. an eerie impression that the object had returned and was hov- ering low over the camper. She roused her husband from a deep sleep, and when he realized what was happening, he hurried out the rear door. He saw an indistinct shape traveling away into the southerly sky. He also recognized the sound emanat- ing from it as identical with the,tri- shaped object -with the vivid light beam. It was about one-half mile away, slpwly proceeding into the dis- tance, and the size of a quarter at arm's length. Estimated duration of this visual sighting was approximate- ly one minute.  ; The Thompsons remained quiet about these odd events; upon their return home they shared them only with Officer Maurice Allen. Due to Thompson's position as ang lapd law enforcement..officer, .he' did not want to publicly reveal his experience. Tt is a tribute bot^ to the mature public attit. 1 \"!;, Loward UFOs at the present time, and to the Thompsons them- selves, that this case has at last come to light. At the time of MUFON's interview with the Thompsons, he was still on active duty instructing police re- cruits in the use of firearms at the L. A. Police Academy. Both witnesses were careful-in their statements and entirely free from any tendency to embellish details. They have no par- ticular interest in UFOs and have preferred over the years to think that the object/was an experimental air : craft of terrestrial design. However, they state that the sound emitted was definitely not that of any ordinary aircraft. They remain puzzled to this day why.an \"experimental aircraft\" should have been,.performing, sur- veillance of this type. A Mathematical Analysis Following the writer's investiga- tion of the Thompson report, Donald Weitzel, a Southern California engin- eer, contributed a painstaking mathe- matical analysis based on the dis- tances, sizes and angles provided by the witnesses. His figures show that Mr. Thompson was more than con- servative in his estimate ,of 40;56 feet for the object's length. Weitzel states that the object's length was on the order of 190 feet, oddly correlative of Thompson's statement that the object was \"like a DC-10 going over prac- tically overhead.\" The entire.text of the MUFON investigation and the subsequent mathematical analysis are on file at MUFON headquarters and at SKYLOOK off ices. The growing tendency of UFOs to show themselves to law enforcement officers might well.be deliberate attempts on the part ,of UFO entities to be viewed by responsible authori- ties. Concerning this,, it is well to remember the case of Patrolman Herbert Schirmer of Ashland, Nebr., who experienced a strange encounter with an alien craft and its occupants on Dec. 1, 1967. The opening question fired at Schirmer by the longheaded, grayskinried entity was, \"Are you the watchman over this place?\" Pennsylvania Sightings Continue By Stan Gordon Pennsylvania Center for UFO Research UFO sightings since July of .this . year have been coming into the Pennsylvania Center'on.an average . of- two sightings per day. Sjghtlngs. of Jupiter, Venus, and bther natural occurrences, have been responsible for many of these sightings. However, a number of unexplained aerial vis- itors apparentlyare still about.' For example during the first two. weeks of July, numerous witnesses in about a five-mile radius of Latrobe observed a 'large .metallic;, cigar shaped object hovering at .tree top level. At the, same time,: numerous reports 6f' metallic .appearing, discs, ' some in formation, were also being seen.  •. '' , . On the night of July 10,\"-UFO sight- ings were reported throughout many points in the state. Near Chambers- burg, a young woman reported that her -vehicle was chased by a thirty- foot diameter disc ; for several miles, while the object remained only inches above .the roof of her car. Several other witnesses in tthe.area also re- . ported similar sightings simul- taneously. On July. 27, near Butler, a woman reported that a round similar object with red flashing lights and., legs :at the bottom hovered outside of her window, and just seemed to float on the air.  , On Augusts, at approximately .4:50 p.m., a group- of .witnesses near Greensburg , repqrtedly .; observed three flat, siver discs hover about 100 feet in altitude then ascend toward the east. A few second later, three more similar objects flew past them- heading in the same direction. • We have received dozens of reports of bright, orange spheres making erratic movements in the night skies, and at times dropping flaming sparks. The reports do not seem to fall into the hot air balloon category, due to the unusual movements of these lights."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"Cult of'The Two' composed of five elements Editor's Note: -Dr. Downing is a Presbyterian minister and the author of the\" well-known book THE BIBLE AND FLYING SAUCERS. His aca- demic background represents a com\"- bination of science and religion. A SKYLOOK stafi: member since 1974, he has: contributed several articles and book reviews. By Barry H. Downing Most Skylook readers have prob- ably beenlqllqwirig the national news headlines concerning the Oregon cult whose members are. waiting to . be taken off to heaven, or another planet, in a UFO. (A news summary appeared in the October issue of. SKYLOOK.) Most serious students of UFO's undoubtedly regret the exist, ence of such groups — they just in : crease the ridiqule that must be borne by serious UFO students. The cult made for good news cov- erage because of several strange aspects. It was founded by a man and woman who never attended.the pro- motional meetings, according to the newspaper accounts available, Even- tually it was discovered that the leadv ers were Marshall Herff Applewhite and Bonnie Lu Trusdale Nettles. The cult taught that eventually Jesus and his space brothers would be corning to earth in a UFO to take the \"true believers\" to heaven; this \"second coming\" of Christ happens only once every 2000 years, so that those who miss this flight are in trouble. The true believers must, give up everything—family, money, jobs, sex — and concentrate on meditating, this process will bring a person's mind and body to \"100% perfection.\" As one disciple said, \"99% perfect will not do.\" Those less than perfect will not make the heavenly \"flight. One added element of \"strangeness\" is the teaching ^that each person has a spirit or guardian angel to help him in his meditating process. Good Newspaper Copy All this made for good newspaper copy, together with the \"disappear- ance\" of about 30 people who joined the cult, with the possibility that they had already \"gone to heaven.\" It seems to me there are five major 10 elements which taken together have produced the Oregon UFO cult: li The general emotional strain of living in the 1970's. 2) Christian teaching, 3) the space age mentality and UFOs in particular, 4) influence of Eastern religions, including mtovements like Transcendental Meditation and 5) Spiritualism. Thus if we examine the group and divide it into these five familiar elements; we will discover \"the Anatomy of .a UFO Cult.\" Emotional Strain 1) The emotional strain of living through this decade is evident to all. If it isn't Watergate, or the probable financial disaster of New York City, it is the Middle East. This has given many people the feeling of impending - doom: . In this context there are many peo- ple willing to listen to any plan for salvation — anything to get us out of this world before it blows up. In.the meantime, Marshall Herff Apple- white is going through his own emo- tional crisis. Applewhite is.a.Presbyterian min- ister's son who has a master's degree in music, and is an assistant professor of music at the University of St. Thomas in Houston, Texas. He also sings in the Houston Opera, and for all appearances, is hard driving and suc- cessful. But suddenly he is given a year's leave of absence, according to University . records, because of \"health, problems of.-an emotional nature.\" •'•\"-'.;  • Applewhite goes to New York, meets a soul-mate, Bonnie Lu Trus- dale Nettles, who then returns to Texas with Applewhite to open an occult study center. What are the elements of the \"world view\" or religion they develop? / Christian Traditions 2) It is clear from some of the teachings of the UFO Cult group that some of the Christian traditions are maintained, especially three ele- ments. . a) The group believes in the second coming of Christ, which they have tied in with the UFO concept—UFOs providing the vehicle for Christ's second coming and return to heaven. This idea is not so hew — I suggested this in my book The Bible and Flying Saucers in 1968, as a possibility. b) .The' second link between the UFO cult and Christianity is its ob- vious emp'hasis on faith. If you do not believe the teachings of the cult, you cannot be \"saved.\". Perfection As A Virtue c) The third emphasis of the group is on perfection. This.is riot new to American Protestant Christianity. In the 1820s, communities and groups such as Zoar, Oneida, Amana, Shakers and Transcendentalists developed, many aiming at \"perfectipn.\" Newspapers noted that the Oregon Cult required its members to sell all they had, in order to become perfect. This was probably based on the teach- ing of Jesus who said to the Rich Young Ruler who asked Jesus what he must do to be perfect. Jesus said, \"If you would be perfect, go, sell what you possess and give, to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me\" (Matthew 19:21). The group emphasized the idea that believers must be perfect in order to be ready to be transformed and taken on board the UFO on the appointed day. From my personal religious .point of view, it is here that I reject the teachings of the Cult. The emphasis of the group is really"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"selfish — self perfection. Jesus did not teach self perfection as an end in itself. Rather he taught that love of God and love of neighbor is the way to self perfection. The emphasis of Christianity is on love, not on self perfection. Thus the Apostle Paul in his famous hymn on love said, \"If I give away all I have, and if I deliver my body to be burned, but have not love,-I gain nothing\" (1 Corinthians 13:3). I have seen little, in fact nothing, in published reports to indicate a call to go out and serve the world in this cult group. In fact, the group is main- ly withdrawing from the world to try to save its own neck, as it were, and too bad about everybody else. But in any case, some of the teachings of Christianity are used, and since Applewhite is a Presbyterian minis- ter's son, it is not surprising he uses some Christian teachings. One thing to note about the per- fectionist teaching. If something goes wrong, if the UFO does not arrive on schedule to take true believers on their, heavenly ride, the leaders can say, \"The reason we failed is that you did not obey us and become perfect.\" The Bible teaches we are saved not by our own perfection, but rather by God's grace, by the forgiveness of a loving heavenly- Father. In my opin- ion, religion that teaches we can only be saved.by our own perfection is not good news, and it is not Christianity either. UFO Image 3) ; Another element of the UFO Cult obviously is that it has drawn on the UFO image as part of its plan of salvation. UFOs provide a link with the- universe, something Christianity has lost in the past century. Even though Jesus said he came from heaven — from the outer Universe — the age of science found this hard to believe. If UFOs are there, we can again believe — in the name of truth and science — that heavenly beings are looking out for us. Most scientists find that the re- ligious aspect, of the UFO problem just muddies the scientific UFO water. I can sympathize with the frus- trations of men like Dr. J. Allen Hynek is trying to deal with the UFO \"religious nut fringe,\" of which I am undoubtedly, a part in the. eyes of many. Dr. Edward Condon in his Colorado Scientific Study of Uniden- tified Flying Objects, much to the dis- may of serious UFO students, paid close attention to the \"nut fringe.\" Dr. Carl Sagan of Cornell .Univer- sity has said-he believes most people are interested in UFOs 'to fill re- ligious needs. There is no denying there is much truth to this view. How- ever, it is a false logic which con- cludes too soon that just because peo- ple have a religious hunger that they have created UFOs. : any more than we can say that people have created food because they have physical hun- ger.- The existence of food and our need for food happen to match up. Maybe there is both a religious hun- ger, and a religious match up, in the UFO area.  ' • • ,- Eastern Religions 4) A further element in the cult is the influence of Eastern religions, seen in the emphasis of the group on reincarnation, and on meditation. As most., people know, there has been widespread interest in Transcenden-. tal. Meditation. The group has un- doubtedly drawn from this move- ment. Again, science has said that meditation . affects the chemical makeup of the body. The Oregon Cult group teaches that through self denial and meditation the body will be trans- formed so that it can be taken aboard the UFO when it comes. . The group also teaches reincarna- tion. In fact, it is taught that if people do not get on board this \"Second Coming\" of Christ, they.will have to.. be reincarnated for another 2000 years before they get another chance to get out of this world. -They, teach it is 2000 years \"between heavenly UFO.trips. j 5) The final element in the teaching of the cult is spiritualism. Applewhite taught that he was in contact with spirits, in particular \"Brother Fran- cis,\" a monk who died in Greece in- 1818. They .teach, that every person who joins their cult group has a guardian angel or spirit who will guide them to perfection in their meditation.  •-• .- • This whole process of waiting for the coming of Jesus with : his UFO, perfection through self denial and meditation, is-called \"Human Indi- vidual Metamorphosis.\" or -HIM. When -you reach perfection; you are ready for your heavenly UFO ride. Coffee, Tea, or Milk? Thus, when we separate the indi- vidual parts of the Oregon UF.O Cult, we discover that most of the teach- ings are familiar to many people in their separate forms. What is not familiar is the synthesis. . It is like being offered a glass, of soft drink which is orange, Coke, and root beer combined. If we -did .not know .what was in the glass, it would probably taste very strange. Once-we know the contents, the taste, is not so surprising. Still, it is not a drink most of us are likely to come to love. Neither is the. Oregon UFO Cult likely to become a favorite religious movement in. the United States. \"Hoaxed again!

Warren and Joseph Accetta Los Alamos UFO Study Group MUFON state director for New Mexico and MUFON state director'for Los Alamos County A Mr. Tillapaugh reported an object which allegedly fell from the sky in the morning hours of January 12, 1975 on his farm in Schoharie County, New York near the town of Carlisle. (May, 1975,SKYLOOK,page8.) According to Mr. Tillapaugh, the object crashed through some trees, glanced off his tractor, bounced to the ground and landed on a patch of ice, where it produced a small cloud of steam and melted its way to the earth. The object, which weighed ap- proximately one pound, appeared to be a piece of metal with a brownish : coating. The local sheriff was unable to iden- tify the object and was put in contact with Mr. Ernest Jahn of NIGAP, who subsequently requested help in identi- fication from J. Alan Hynek of the Center for UFO Studies. Professor Hynek had some chemical and metallographic analysis of the object carried out by Chicago Spectro Ser- vice Laboratory and students of Pro- fessor Meshii of Northwestern Uni- versity. The preliminary analysis in- ; dicated that the object contains iron, has a rust coloration, is magnetic, and has experienced extreme thermal shock. The object found its way to Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory early in September for further analysis. The portion of the object which was received from Prof. Hynek was sub- jected to several tests in order to try to determine its history. Its residual radioactivity was mea- sured in a low background counter. It was x-rayed, to look for gross in- ternal structures such as voids or cracks. X-ray fluorescence was used to determine some of its chemical constituents. A 4-mm section was sliced from the object parallel to face created by a section made by North-- western investigators; This section was subjected to metallographic ex- amination. The section'• was s'ubse- quently examined using x-ray fluor- escence, electron microprobe and ion probe analysis. Whereas electron microprobe is sensitive to the lighter chemical elements, the ion probe is better for determining the presence of heavier elements. Basically, the analysis done at Los Alamos verified many of the chem- ical findings of Northwestern Uni- versity investigators, but disagreed with some of the interpretation of their metallographic analysis. The object showed no residual radio- activity. Conspicuously absent was radiation from Mns4 which has a half- life of 312 days. In 1962, Los Alamos examined a piece of a Russian space capsule which fell in Wisconsin. The presence of Mn54was easily detected. From this we would have to conclude that the object has not recently been sub- jected to cosmic rays from outer space. It is unlikely that it is a piece of space junk. X-ray examination showed no.sig- nificant voids or cracks. X-ray fluor- escence studies reveal the main con- stituent to be iron with varying amounts of aluminum, silicon, man- ganese, zinc, copper, molybdenum, bromine, tin and lead, but no nickel. The absence of nickel would tend to eliminate its origin as meteoric. The brownish coating on the outside con- tained large amounts of lead and sul- fur, with iron manganese, zinc, cop- per, molybdenum, and bromine also being observed. The chemical compo- sition of the main portion of the object are consistent with known compositions of common cast iron, or socalled gray iron. Metallographic examination also concludes that the object is basically an oxidized gray cast iron with a lead based partial surface coating. There is not evidence to conclude that the object did not originate on earth. The extensive oxidation immediate- ly under the surface coating suggests post heating of .the iron after it was cast.  . - - The presence of the rosette pattern of cast iron plus the fact that there is a lead-based surface coating sug- gests that the post heating was not extreme, in contradiction to the con- clusions drawn by the Northwestern investigators. The oxidation probably occurred over a long period of time, certainly it would not have occurred as a result of falling through the earth's atmosphere from outer space. The ion probe revealed that the bro- mine is probably a surface contami- nant. The lead isotope ratios were measured and compared with a stand- ard sample. The ratios are the same and once again point to an earthly origin of the object In conclusion, our studies lead us to believe that the object is of earthly origin and probably of human manu- facture, although like the sheriff of Schoharie County, we are. unable to identify its functional origin or ex- . plain why Mr. Tillapaugh observed it to fall from the sky and melt ice. If one sets aside Mr. Tellapaugh's observations for the moment, it might be suggested that the object was part of an old manufactured piece such as a container for casting or refining lead, or a lead coated bearing sur- face for a moving piece of machin- ery. If the object had been buried in the earth some time, it might have acquired the sulfide coating to the lead, but that is not obviously true. It should be noted that a quick check at the New York Historical Association in Cooperstown (about 50km from Carlisle) reveals no his- tory of iron smelting in Schoharie County, but does record the establish- ment of a foundry in 1846 to produce plows. The object has been returned to NICAP and a full report acknowledg- ing the efforts will be compiled with- in the next month.

Looking up, he saw in the NE sky a silvery-gray egg-shaped object travel- ing east in a straight line. It stopped to the east of him for a few seconds, then rose vertically until it was lost to sight. The sighting lasted about a minute. The sky was clear, no clouds, no wind. No sound was heard and the UFO left no trail. Dec. 13, 1974, at about 11 p.m. a woman in .Ainslie, Canberra, was in her bedroom when she noticed a bright circle of white light on the bedspread. Looking out the window she saw a vivid red sphere with cones or spikes of lighter red projecting from it. The woman went into the kitchen to inform her husband, and together they watched the object move slowly westward through an arc of about 20 degrees. Then it suddenly changed color to brilliant white and acceler- ated away almost instantaneously to the southeast. The night was calm and clear. A summary of 1974 reports in Tas- mania indicates a total of 133 reports, 37 of which were considered \"Un- known.\" Astronomical objects, satel- lites, and aircraft are indicated to be the cause of most mistaken re- ports.  , . .. ... ..

Allen Hynek of the Center for UFO Studies (CUFOS) would like to remind MUFON investigators that the UFO Central telephone is not for their use. Says Hynek: \"Apparently, the use of UFO CEN- TRAL is not clear to some investi- gators. We have received calls from •• investigators, telling of cases in their area. Also, we have received mes- sages irom investigators. This is not the purpose of UFO CENTRAL. \"UFO CENTRAL should never be used by investigators, since we as- sume they are already investigating the case. It is primarily for reports which need immediate investigation, where no investigator is available or aware of the report. Since we must pay for each of those calls, and all of us in the UFO field are well aware of the lack of funds syndrome, I hope that possibly through SKYLOOK, a better understanding can be reached. \"We attempt to answer all investi- gators letters as soon as possible, and to reply to reports submitted. I certainly want to thank ai! of the MUFON people who have generously cooperated with the Center. \"So, though we hope all investi- gators would let their local law agencies know about UFO CENTRAL and supply them with the number, we hope it can be made clear that this number should not be used to report cases which are under investi- gation.\" Registry hotline available A toll-free 24-hour UFO hotline has reportedly been established by the International UFO Registry, P.O.

Date: 25 November, 1973. Place: Smedjebacken, a small com- munity about 10 km east of the town of Ludvika, in the central part of Sweden. The approximate geograph- ical position of Smedjebacken would be longitude 16 degrees east, latitude 60 degrees, 50 minutes north. Narrative: It was at 1:25 a.m. in the morning of Nov. 25, 1973, that Mr. H. and Miss S. happened to look out of the window. Then they saw a bril- liant white-yellowish light, seemingly originating from the ground and widening upwards into conical shape, formed like a searchlight beam. They opened the window in order to hear any engine sounds (none men- tioned). They observed a dense fog, restricted to the light cone. After a few minutes, they discovered a simi- lar light cone in bearing northwest. Some 4-5 minutes later, a third ob- ject came (flying) straight through the fog from the west (obviously they had earlier observed .two objects al- though none is mentioned in the re- port). The object decelerated, stopped seemingly in the first light cone, and again accelerated in an easterly di- rection. Shortly afterwards, they saw a third light cone to the east, in shape like the two first ones. The distances between the lights were about two kilometers. After a time space of about 5 minutes, all three (objects) started to vibrate simultaneously, alight from the ground, and slowly drift east. The fog remained awhile, and then dissolved slowly. The whole sequence contact the International Director of MUFON to schedule this set for your meetings at no cost except for post- age. A UFO slide/tape recorded lec- ture with 160 slides has been prepared by the MUFON/Nebraska Section, and is also available from MUFON by advanced reservation for postage costs. of events took about 20 minutes. The objects were round in shape and seemed to be of light-grey color. Their diameter was estimated to be 10-12 meters. No sounds could be heard. The weather was clear and fine (the witnesses mention that the stars could be seen). There is another observation by two other witnesses that ties in with the above observation. I relate it below. Observers: Mr. Gunnar Eriksson, and Miss Linda Skalberg. Date: 25 November, 1973, and 24 April, 1973. Place: Grangesberg (Grangesberg is a small mining community, located approximately 20 kilometers west and 8 kilometers south of Smedje- backen). Narrative: The witnesses were seated at the kitchen table when through the window they noticed a brilliantly lit object. The time of ob- servation was from 1 a.m. to 1:30 a.m. A brilliant light, greenish-blue, moved in an arc away towards the horizon. The light returned, seemed to circle, then to disappear in an easter- ly direction. At times, a fixed (sta- tionary) point could be observed that seemed to be a \"source\" of the light. The distance to the light (object) could not be estimated. Mr. Hellberg and Miss Segelstrom next observed something on April 24, 1974. The place of observation was the same as at the first sighting. Narrative: They could see the ob- jects for 15 minutes, between 4:15 a.m. and 4:35 a.m., as it passed from northeast towards southwest. It had a light, lead-grey surface, about 12 meters in diameter. The shape was disc-like. A cuplike protusion was vis- ible on the upper surface, and a simi- lar one below, although larger. The object seemed to shimmer, as if it had been very hot (the word aura is used in the description). Estimated distance 1100 meters, estimated ground height 900 meters. At the same time, a weather bal- loon was found in the vicinity. How- ever, (the witnesses could see no con- nection between the balloon and their observation, since the (observed) object had a very strange shape, and in addition seemed to emit some sort of radiation. **** Comment: It seems likely, that all four witnesses observed the same object on Nov. 25, 1973. The story is similar to that reported in the June 1975 issue of SKYLOOK.

A feature common to the Oct. 7, 1975, Ontario UFO and humanoid report, the Nov. 5 Arizona abduction case, the March 1966 \"swamp gas\" case, and many others that come to mind is the \"irregular and crinkled\" surface. Words like \"waffled,\" \"faceted,\" and \"cross-hatched\" have been used to describe textured surfaces, as opposed to the stereotyped \"smooth, shiny\" surface of the classic \"fly- ing saucer.\" It would be a good project for someone to compile a cat- alogue of UFOs with textured surfaces, since this is a feature not easy to account for in terms of conventional objects, a feature that im- plies close-range observation (if not optical illusion), and a feature of interest aerodynamically. ******* My friend Ann Druffel has done a superb job of checking out and reporting a typical \"light in the sky\" case and of illustrating the essential weakness of such cases. The lesson here is that unless the witnesses show evidence of having made ele- mentary checks (lining up the object with a landmark such as a pole and timing its mo- tion, noting whether it moves in relation to the star back- ground, etc.), such data are totally worthless. A duration of several hours for a \"UFO\" sighting is almost an abso- lute guarantee that it was a planet, bright star, or bal- loon. Dvight Connelly's account of the Ft. Smith UFO confer- ence is a good summary of \"where we are\" in UFO re- search. The question is, where are we going? I do not think cooperation between major UFO groups can, prag- matically, take the form of dividing up types of cases for \"major emphasis.\" However, I see no reason why there couldn't be cooper- ation on fundamentals. As two examples of \"fundamentals,\" major groups ought to be able to cooperate (1) in pooling data to compile catalogues of types of UFO reports and (2) in sharing data on known phe- nomena and conventional events that are causing false UFO reports. Both of these CUFOS selects 138 for tentative meeting The Center for UFO Studies is ten- tatively considering the advisability of scheduling a meeting in the spring, possibly April 15, to bring together a selected group of qualified persons to look at \"the state of UFO research.\" A list of 138 persons invited to the meeting was circulated in late No- vember. According to Dr. J. Allen Hy- nek, director of the Center, it is ex- pected that no more than one-fourth would be able to attend. Dr. Hynek told SKYLOOK that the list represents only a portion of per- sons in the field who meet the criteria established for participants: \"those who have seriously investigated and reported on many UFO cases in the field, and those who have written ser- iously on the subject ... in an un- prejudiced manner.\" would be in the common in- terest of all concerned,. Another possible means of beginning some cooperation might be a monthly or bi- monthly scheduled exchange of basic data among CUFOS, APK0, MUFON, and NICAP. This data might include number and' types of reports received,; statistics on geographical distribution, and similar inS formation. The fact of doing this routinely, and gradually ex- panding the scope -of the ex- change, would be a riefnthreat- eniiig approach to cooperation for a common cause. At a time' when international coopera\"- tion seems vitally important, one would hope that ^e could get it together domeS't'i,eally.
