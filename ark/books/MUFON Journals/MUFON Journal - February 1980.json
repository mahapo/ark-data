POSTMASTER: Send form 3579 to advise change of address to The MUFON UFO JOURNAL, 103 Oldtowne Rd., Seguin, Texas 78155 FROM THE EDITOR As a UFO activist of 25 years' standing, I am an interested observer of the latest trends and fashions of so-called \"ufology\" as we enter the 1980's. Extraterrestrial \"nuts and bolts\" are \"out.\" Other dimensions and mind manipulators are \"in.\" Large UFO groups are (mostly) \"out.\" Numerous scattered study groups are- \"in.\" Shy, evasive humanoids are \"out.\" Abductions, medical examinations, and \"messages\" are \"in.\" While not all of the changes are bad, some sound suspiciously like impatience to have some final answers so that subjective and rationalistic approaches are being substituted for empirical science. The truth — whatever it is — will not be found without a concerted, cooperative effort among all those with relevant skills to offer. We may be impatient for answers, but unless the \"source\" provides them it is unlikely they will be found except by the painstaking methods of science. Since \"weekend warriors\" can only do so much, a primary goal should be to enlist the aid of professionals so that meaningful analyses are conducted in CE-II and CE-III & IV cases. Science and the intelligent public will respond to well-documented evidence. Personal or subjective truths, no matter how impressive or gratifying to an individual, are no substitute for measurable, mutually verifiable facts. In this issue INTERVIEW WITH ARTHUR C.

LUNDAHL By Patrick Huyghe In December 1978, the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency released more than 900 pages of UFO-related documents that attest to the Agency's interest and involvement in UFOs over the past 30 years. Among the CIA's UFO papers were documents written by, concerned with, or addressed to Arthur C. Lundahl, the former director of the CIA's National Phtographic Interpretation Center (NPIC). Lundahl joined the CIA in 1953 and served as NPIC director from 1963 to 1973, the year he retired. In the course of doing an extensive article on the government's scrutiny of the UFO phenomenon for The New York Times Sunday Magazine (published on Oct. 14, 1979), I interviewed Lundahl at length about the CIA's 1953 Robertson Panel Report, Edward Condon's Colorado UFO project in 1967, the CIA's involvment in UFOs, as well as his own interest in the phenomenon. Question: What kind of help did the CIA provide the Condon UFO project? Didn't the Air Force contact you in February 1967 to help Condon? Arthur Lundahl: Yes, that's correct. But I really couldn't provide any real help in the substantive sense because I don't know anything about UFOs at all. You see, Dr. Condon had been away from Washington for some time and he was unwitting perhaps of the status of technology in the photogrammetry field. You know there are all kinds of esoteric hardware, new kinds of photographic techniques for enhancing images and things like that. Since at the time I was director of NPIC, the Air Force asked me if I would have Dr. Condon and two of his assistants over to talk about the state of the art in the photogrammetry field. He was a very nice man and a brilliant, well- known scientist. We had a nice visit and I think he came back another time. But as far as any substance, any additions, or suggestions going into the report, I claim none of those whatsoever. Q: In a CIA memo dated February 7, 1967, you state that you wanted to \"preserve a CIA window\" on the Condon UFO project. What did you mean by that? AL: That, in the parlance of the trade, means just a seat like a mouse in the comer to hear what's going on. It involves no responsibilities, only curiosity. I, the little mouse in the corner, was interested because I was responsible for interpreting any kind of picture that the United States might have at its disposal, whether it be Cuban missiles or anything else, so I sure wanted to know a little bit about the phenomenon involved. If there was something worthwhile coming out of the Condon project that would aid in the interpretation of subsequent pictures, I thought it would be good for the national welfare to know what those characteristics were — what they found. Q: Other CIA memos in 1967 mention such things as \"the second UFO project assigned\" and \"UFO Mensuration Support project.\" What do they refer to? AL: Well, mensuration is frequently used alternately with photogrammetry. But I didn't have any UFO project. I think it may be a vagary of the text. I don't know the answer but I'll offer a guess that Condon may have said \"I've got this thing here in my briefcase\" and passed some pictures over and asked us to give him a dimension on the object. You probably know, but I should mention, that photogrammetry is the science of extracting quantitative information on the real world from measurements off of pictures. As I dig back in my memory, it seems that instead of being called a project the better word would have been \"task.\"(*) Q: The CIA memos also show that you advised Condon not to make any reference to the Agency's help in his UFO project. Why? AL: The phenomenon is a fulminating subject, you see. There are lots of wild- eyed nuts in this field who sit on mountaintops doing drugs and waiting for the sunrise. There are guys with psychic phenomena pouring out of their ears. There are weird people all over. And of course, the CIA is a kind of exciting enough name in itself. And if you mix fire and kerosene together, you get the whole place excited. I wanted to be careful and not imply that we were substantially involved. I was hoping he wouldn't make a big case about the fact that the CIA was in the project. Q: Were you satisfied with the conclusions of the Condon project? AL: I really don't think they did a very good job as scientists. Speaking as a geologist, I really don't think of the Condon project as a detached, cold- - blooded view of the subject. Some of the staffers realized that they were part of a big sham; that it wasn't going to be an even-handed treatment of the matter. They found that Condon would just produce a great big kind of document that was going to sweep it all under the rug. The biggest whitewash of all was when the National Academy of Sciences put some kind of foreword on the book. I don't think they even read the damn thing. Q: Did you join the CIA before or after the CIA produced the Robertson Panel Report in 1953? AL: I joined the CIA just afterwards. But I knew a little bit about the Robertson Panel because at that time I had been working for the U.S. Navy Photo Interpretation Laboratory (in Anacostia, D.C.), where I was assistant chief engineer. Some naval (continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"(Interview, Continued) officer named Newhouse had taken some pictures out in Utah in a place called Tremonton. He had turned them over to the Air Force, and they had scanned them and did whatever they were going to do with them. Then the Air Force passed them over to us. I was in the front office handling budget and finance at the time, so I didn't do any analysis of the film. But I had a couple of men who worked on it. They spent quite a few hours looking at the images. While we were studying the photos somebody called up from the CIA, I think it was General Phil Strong. .He was the executive secretary of the arranging committee for the Robertson . Panel, I think. He explained that they had these noteworthy scientists coming together and could someone from our organization bring this film over and have it projected and stand by to answer whatever questions they could. Robert Neasham and Harry Woo showed the film to the panel many times and told them what analysis they had done on it. The problem was that they didn't have a single number to go on: they didn't know how big the things were or how far away they were. As Archimedes said: \"Give me a place to stand, and I will move the earth.\" Well, we needed one number to get the other. So they had blocked out a hypothetical matrix of possibilities .and presented them to the panel. The panel was polite, interested, and respectful and thanked the men for coming over. My men were dismissed, and that was all there was to it. But I found out years later when I was reading paperbacks on the episode that the Robertson Panel pretty much thought the images were high-flying birds.(*) Q: Did that upset your men, who had spent 1,000 hours analyzing the film? AL: No, I don't think it upset them. We didn't know what it was we were looking at. The images were not sharply resolved; there was no clear cut geometry that anybody could see. There were objects up there, but none of us knew anything about migratory birds. Although it had seemed to us that migratory birds at that height, whatever height it was, would not have been able to make a good target on the film. Q: Was the CIA officially interested in UFOs? AL: I don't know what the CIA's interest was. I never found an official version or opinion of any CIA position on the matter. In fact, I found a gross lack of interest as far as any of the people I talked to were concerned. The people that I talked to didn't seem to have any interest. Now, there may have been other people in large numbers working on this that I knew nothing about. Maybe I shouldn't say a gross lack of interest; it's simply an exciting subject. But there was no official pushing attitude on UFOs. Gen. Strong followed it. He was in the Office of Scientific Intelligence (OSI), and we were just friends. Q: What was Gen. Strong's interest in UFOs? AL: What I remember best of Strong and the Robertson Panel in the 1950's was the concern over the welter of UFO reports coming in on various channels that might clog the North American defense pattern. Had there been some kind of real attack or threat of some kind, it might have gotten lost in the shuffle of confusing information. I think Phil Strong's main interest was to make sure that communications would not be done in by this thing, illusory or real or whatever it was. That's the main thing that got the CIA and the Robertson people together in the first place. Q: Was anyone else in the CIA interested in UFOs while you were there? AL: I remember another CIA man named Al Moore in OSI who was very interested in this subject in 1953-54. We were both Naval reserve officers. Moore was just wrapped around the axle full of interest in the UFO phenomenon. As I looked at his face and listened to his words I formed a feeling that this guy was more enthusiastic about the subject than Phil Strong ever was. He eventually left the CIA and opened up a patent law office in Mississippi. He was of the opinion that UFOs were something very real and that the extraterrestrial hypothesis was probably the least unacceptable one. That was his personal belief. Nothing official. Q: Did the CIA have an active UFO project while you were there? AL: I had a job which got me ' involved with everybody's business. A picture can be made of anything, and ipso facto I was involved with everybody and everything. It seems to me that had there been some real ongoing UFO project I would have known something about it. If they had any pictoral evidence they would have had to bring it to my place for analysis. They knew I was trustworthy and not a crackpot. It seems to me that I would have had a fair chance of knowing. But I never heard of a single project, a single funded endeavor of any kind dedicated to finding out some kind of answer to the UFO enigma.(*) Whatever I knew about it was entirely coincidental. I read paperbacks on the subject. But some outside observer might look at my job, which was very important, and notice my Tremonton background and my meetings with Condon, and they'd believe that I had a huge bunch of projects going on, analyzing pictures, reporting them to the President just like Cuban missiles, and keeping all this from the public. Well, I can assure you that nothing is further from the truth. The interest in UFOs may well have randomized among its employees, as it did with me. But I used to go to budget review functions, I used to listen to mission summations; and no where along the line did I ever gather the impression that this was a real ongoing effort with the CIA. Q: Within the past year or so the National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena (NICAP) in Washington, D.C., has undergone a reorganization. Were you not offered the position of NICAP director? AL: I really wasn't offered the position. Somebody called me up about a year or two ago but I had no idea if he was calling from the Defense Department or NICAP. He sounded off his name as if he were familiar to me, but I never did figure out who had called me. Anyway he started telling me about NICAP's financial problems and change of command. At one point he said there would be someone new to take over at NICAP. Then as an aside he said: \"Hey, Art, that might be a good (continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"(Interview, Continued) job for you in retirement. You're not doing anything now.\" I said: \"Are you crazy? If I were starving I wouldn't take a job like that.\" And he asked me why not. I said: \"Do you realize with the background I have in CIA, if I suddenly showed up at NICAP, I couldn't even hold the front portals until the 4:30 whistles blew. There'd be more crazy people in there than you could shake a stick at with allegations I could never cope with — wild!\" He said: \"Yeah, I didn't think of it that way. I guess it would be a fiery mixture.\" You bet your boots, I said. If you call that a job offer, that's what happened. Q: How do you feel about your employment with the CIA? AL: I don't have any slings and arrows to throw at the CIA. I found them to be an excellent employer. I thought they were wonderful, .dedicated people. I've had tremendous experiences there, meeting people, and dealing with big issues. I don't know'of . any job I could have had that I would have enjoyed more. I guess the only way to top it would have been to have a great big fat UFO land out there on the monument grounds and we'd covered it from three sides with metric cameras with all -kinds of things including magnetic spin recorders and then we got it all measured up and we went on NBC live at 8 o'clock Sunday night and told the world what was there. I guess that would have been a topper, but we never had a shot at that. EDITORIAL COMMENT These notes correspond to sections of the interview marked with an asterisk. The question of whether Art Lundahl and the CIA are or were \"officially\" involved with UFO investigations is an important one. Lundahl has always denied it, and has often professed great ignorance of the subject. However, it is known from private sources that during the early 1960's the Air Force routinely referred movie films of UFOs (from gun cameras and other sources) to NPIC for analysis, while Lundahl was NPIC Director. Also, Lundahl had another \"window\" on the Colorado Project through a friend at Raytheon Corporation who did some photo- analysis for the Condon Committee. The Navy photo-analysis lab did have \"numbers\" to go on in analyzing the Newhouse film, and Lundahl must have known that. They had lens resolution data . and someone in government had frames of the film showing one of the UFOs disappearing over the horizon . (frames that were missing when the Air Force returned the film to Newhouse). Ex-Major Dewey Fournet, Project Blue Book Monitor in the Pentagon, told NICAP that the Navy analysis specifically ruled out birds, \"...it would be necessary to conclude that Newhouse was lying in many. of his statements in order to conlcude that the Tremonton objects were birds,\" Fournet said, and the intelligence officers considered him to be \"completely sincere and somewhat reserved.\" (See The UFO Evidence, p. 112.) The evidence indicates that both the CIA Office of Scientific Intelligence and NPIC, under Art Lundahl, have had a long-standing and official interest in UFOs and that Lundahl probably knows more about the nature and performance of UFOs, as determined by photoanalysis, than anyone in the world. He is also part of an informal Washington UFO \"underground\" that includes Robert C. Durant (writer of the 1953 CIA panel report) and Dr. Charles Sheldon, expert on Russian missiles and rockets at the Library of Congress, among others. By making disarming public statements and professions of ignorance, Lundahl has served as a CIA \"cover\" to conceal from the public the extent of the CIA's scientific data and top-level awareness of UFOs.-Richard Hall MUFON personnel who have not already done so are invited to submit photographs of themselves, and of any special equipment or facilities used for UFO investigation or research. If you are part of a group that meets regularly, group photographs also would be welcome.

Tyrodc 1 This affair took place at the beginning of the year 1956, at 1 a.m. The witnesses were two gendarmes on duty, now both retired — M. Barboule at Huchaud (Card) and M. Simon at Saint-Die (Voages). The village of Barre-des- Cevennes, which has 240 inhabitants, is constituted by an uninterrupted row of houses bordering route N.583 for several hundred meters and a few small streets that are difficult to negotiate. This configuration is due to its situation on the slope of a mountain, which extends to the NE, parallel to the road, and peaks at 1015 m. The mountain falls almost precipitously to the village, and the slope continues toward the NW. On that evening early in the year, M. Barboule and M. Simon were coming back from their tours of duty at Cassagnac, heading through the mountain gap in the direction of Barre, pushing their bicycles by hand. It was a routine evening; they had encountered no one on the road. They were about to arrive at the summit of the hill and saw before them the dark mass of the Castelai, on whose slope rests the village Barre'-des-Cevennes. Beside the road was a barn. When they arrived at this barn they suddenly heard a great noise, which they thought was the motor of a truck climbing the hill. They leaned their bicycles against the barn wall while waiting for the truck to pass. Then they realized their error; the noise was coming from the opposite direction, i.e., from Florae. In a few seconds the sound increased intensely and was now a deafening racket, and it seemed now that the noise came from above their heads. Suddenly, opposite them, a few meters from the ground, about 50 meters away, an enormous engiri appeared. It was a sort of black mass which may have been about 10 meters in diameter (assuming that it was circular) and 1.2 m high. At least that was the first impression, but there immediately appeared to them, at the base of the engin, about 60 cm from the ground, something like fluepipes (fuyeres) from which emerged short reddish flames. They were arranged all around the object at its base. The two witnesses also spoke of \"red mouths\" when referring to these. At the same time as this strange vision, a strong hot wind struck them in the face, pushing them against the bam wall. Between the moment when the noise was noticed and when the engin was seen, about 1 minute elapsed. The object continued on toward a flat surface between two hedges, with the barn at one corner and the base about 100 m, and 150 m opposite. When the object passed in front of the two witnesses, they noticed that the reddish openings gave an impression of something heated that was cooling down, \"red-hot iron which was blackening as it cooled.\" The object was then about 50 meters from them, and they noticed that their trousers were whipped by the wind given off by it.   • The object arrived at the platform and landed. In about a minute, the flue- pipes became nearly dark. A sort of cupola on top of the object became illuminated an opaque ivory-white. This cupola was not visible previously. The luminosity seemed to come from the interior. Immediately, between the base of this cupola and the upper surface of the black object, emerged rays of various colors — green, yellow, and blue, blinding like an electric bulb. The rays went off in all directions, but some were more blinding than others. After the appearance of the rays, the witnesses saw the cupola change its shape, or rather an object protruded from it. A kind of \"white balloon\" (nearly round protuberance) detached itself from between the cupola and the black part, from the same region whence the colored rays were emitted, because it seemed illuminated by these rays. The \"balloon\" was itself luminous, but not blinding, and one could easily look at it, as they realized once it had moved obliquely to their left. Its color was matte, ivory-white, of the same color as the cupola. After a short oblique trajectory, the \"balloon\" went off in a straight line in the direction of Castelai, then it seemed to follow along the slope. Its speed was slow, about that of a bicycle. On arriving near the peak, on the right slope as seen by the observers, it disappeared behind the crest. It reappeared on the left slope, and continued on around the hill. It went around it twice in the same way, then returned slightly toward the landed UFO, passing within 50 meters of the two gendarmes. Meanwhile, during the flight of the \"balloon,\" the witnesses had noticed that \"personages\" were moving around the UFO. There may have been four of them. They appeared in the night as shadows moving on the ground. They had the silhouettes and stature of men and moved around the UFO several times, illuminated by the light emanating from the cupola. In the night, in spite of the light of the UFO, it was difficult for the witnesses to see detail, other than to note that they had a human aspect. Two minutes after the balloon departed, it returned. The beings were still passing around their vehicle. The balloon landed on the cupola, or re- entered the interior — the witnesses 1. From Lumieres Dans la Nuit No. 116, 2/72. Translated by Lex Mebane and edited by Ann Druffel."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"(Landing, Continued) could not with certainty say which — the beings re-entered the object, it is not known how. The only thing certain is that the gendarmes no longer saw them. What were the beings doing during the flight of the balloon? The witnesses suppose they must have been inspecting their vehicle. The humanoids remained upright all the time. They seem to be fairly large and walked slowly, like a person who is looking for something. Then the luminous rays disappeared, the cupola light extinguished, and the violent warm wind began to blow again. The \"pipes\" that had been seen as red at the time of arrival did not glow again. A deafening noise was produced and the UFO rose vertically from the ground. The gendarmes had only the time to lift their eyes to see it disappear in the night. Commentaries by the Witnesses When the beings made their appearance, the gendarmes were very much afraid. M. Simon instinctively put his hand on his revolver, saying between his teeth, \"If a rombier comes here, I'll 'dry' him!\" M. Barboule did not understand at first what his colleague was saying. His attention was concentrated on the scene taking place before him. Both had trembling legs and felt paralyzed. During the whole duration of the observation, they did not speak a word to each other, except when they saw the UFO arrive, they said \"It's a saucer!\" They stated later that fear, but also the rays, was paralyzing them, and are incapable of analyzing their state of mind at that moment. M. Barboule Had previously had occasion to feel fear, for example during bombardments, but this fear was different. He has afraid of finding himself faced with a powerful enemy against whom nothing could be done — fear of the unknown, of being taken away or destroyed. Both of them found these moments extremely long, though they lasted only about 5 minutes. At one point, when the hot wind blew on them, they thought that they would be grilled like sausages. M. Simon could at no time take his hand away from his revolver holster, and he thought that the beings were paralyzing him. Once the object had disappeared, they both noticed muscular pains, due perhaps to tenseness during the observation. They had no other after-effects. According to them, they were clearly seen by the occupants of the UFO, who did not trouble themselves otherwise about them. For them the object was really an object; they imagine it to be of metal with a plastic cupola. The light seemed to come from the interior through a translucent layer that did not permit one to see what was happening inside it. When the rays were directed toward them, they appeared as bright as an arc welder's light.. When the UFO had gone, the witnesses' fears were not dissipated. When they remounted their bicycles the two gendarmes were trembling almost as much as when the beings were there. M. Barboule had a \"Lip\" watch which he had bought in 1955. From the day of this observation it no longer kept good time. He took it to a watch repairman in St-Andre-de-Valborgne. This man, after examining it, asked if he had not passed an X-ray machine with the watch in his hand. He replied that it was possible, and M. Valmalle, the repairman, told him: \"If it continues to run badly, bring it back to me.\" It never ran properly, and M. Barboule put it in a drawer where, several years later, his children found it and took it apart. Official Investigation The two gendarmes related their observation in a report addressed to their commanding officer, who reported it to Lt. Guillaume, in charge of the Florae company. Guillaume went to the site. Although at first he was much surprised by the story, he ended up crediting it. One fact militated in favor of the two gendarmes. Several persons in Barre-des-Cevennes that night had been awakened by a very loud noise that seemed to be just above their heads. They did not get out of bed to investigate, but they were much intrigued. Some of them theorized that it might be a secret experiment at the Rhone factories, which proved to be false. Persons came from Marseille to study the phenomenon, but the gendarmes were not made aware of the results. The two witnesses indicated to me that the noise they heard was like that of a caterpillar tractor or a chain-pump, or a clacking like. several hundred motorized tumblers (cu/buteurs de moteurs) all going at once. M. Barboule reproduced the sketch he had made at the time, both of the landing site and of the form of the engin which he and M. Simon had the occasion to observe. POLICY STATEMENT Beginning immediately, the Journal will not publish lengthy articles on abduction stories or alleged humanoid encounters unless they contain' clear-cut evidence of critical investigation by the reporter or original investigator. Only brief \"news story\" reports will be included, until information is available about the character and personality of the claimant, the accuracy and veracity of his/her checkable statements, and the nature and evaluation of any supporting evidence. Preliminary reports that contain much or most of the possible investigation results will be acceptable, provided that they show an effort to obtain complete and objective information. For example, the \"Possible Abduction in New York State\" reported by Budd Hopkins in the July 1979 (No. 137) issue meets these criteria. Once some meaningful investigation has been accomplished, the results — pro or con — will be reported.

According to -him, the object was hovering in the sky for nearly 20 minutes before ft News of the lighting is spreading through the town although many people are still doubtful that it was a UFO. 8"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"REPORTS FROM NORWAY (Submitted by Anton Lidstrom, Norsk UFO Center, 7882 Nordli, Norway) The farmer Oskar Kvetangen and his wife, resident in Nordli, .Nord- Trondelag, had at 06.30 in the morning on October 2, 1976, a strange observation, seen from the windows of their bedroom on the first floor. Kvetangen describes it: \"The weather was bright and clear. My wife had just risen, and looking out of the westward window, she cried; \"Look, what is this!\" I ran to the window, and although I did not see the first phase of the incident, I at length got sight of the square, shining object highest up in the valley. It moved in a north-westerly direction and disappeared in the forest. The distance I estimated to about 12 km. \"At the moment my wife observed the object it was, however, much nearer. The object moved southward, coming from the.riorth, and she clearly could see it in front of a tree-covered hillside, away. A moment afterwards, the object came gliding toward the north again. The speed was about 150- 200 km/h. It continued at that rate up the valley, but I did not get sight of it until the object made the last zig-zag- turn. We could not see how the object turned, but the whole time the square shape was clear with distinct outlines. \"The 'thickness' of the rectangle we could not find out as it seemed the foreside was toward us the whole time. The breadth we estimated to the half part of its length. The color was yellowish and reminded us of the light from a big star. Immediately before the object disappeared, it passed the lower part of a snow drift up in the mountain. We believe that the object passed very near to it. The snow drift was by one of my neighbors estimated to be 50-60 meters long and about 15-20 meters broad. The object seemed to cover one- third of the snow drift. The observation time was 3 minutes.\" From late August until mid- September, 1976, there was a UFO wave in Norway. Saturday, August 21. About noon Helge Evensen was basking on the lawn at his home in Nordbygda (Hedmark). Suddenly he heard a hissing sound and discovered a black object with form and size like that of a disk. The object rushed straight beyond the roof of his house and continued down the field. Sunday, August 22. Between 09- 09.30 a bright cylinder-shaped object was observed above Ringsaker church. The object was quite noiseless, had no wings arid there was no smoke to be seen. It moved in a westerly direction. The elevation was about 70 degrees and the angle extension was 4 cm measured with stretched arm (about 8 times the diameter of the moon). Thursday, August 26. One or more shining objects were seen by a number of persons in Trondheim and both of the Trondelag counties. Among the witnesses was a police sergeant and two traffic pilots. In Nordli, Nord- Trondelag, several people reported they had seen a shining globe-formed object, on one occasion ascending from the ground only about 40 meters from the witnesses, two young girls driving in a car. The object was yellowish of color, but the light from it was much stronger than ordinary moonshine. The size of the globe they estimated to about 25-30 cm. The girls were very scared when the object suddenly rushed up from the bushes, and they were on the point of driving into the ditch. Effects on Car Friday, August 28. At Malsjoen, the guard, Steinar Langeland, was sitting in his car waiting for his hunting companion. The motor was going, but when he was about to start, it began to make trouble. This had never happened to his Mazda before, and he wondered what it could be. As he got out of the car, he observed a shining, square object coming over the hill. The object sank down the mountain side, straight above the tree-tops, keeping the same distance to the ground all the time. The object passed only about 30 meters from the witness, and Langeland says that the light was like a square window and he suspected the outlines of a big, dark object around it. There was no sound, but when the object passed, he heard a crack from the motor of the car. As Langeland examined the motor, he found that two of the sparkplugs were broken across. (They have later been examined at NUFOC, and it is ascertained that the breaches have come up in an inexplicable way.) Several people observed strange, shining objects in Stryn, Olden, Hornindal, and Nordfjord. At Skredestranda a shining globe came close upon the road in front of a lorry. The driver, Jan Rasmussen from Nordfjord, says that the globe was not more than 10-15 meters away from the car and moved to and fro on the road. It made for a way-mark near by where it hovered for a while at the same height as the mark. Then it disappeared into the bushes. Sunday, September 19. A shining object was seen above Olden in Sogn, and on Sunday, October 3 a luminous object lifted from Bispeveien at Tonsberg, only 20 meters in front of a car. Investigations were made at the place by NUFOC.

My wife saw it (continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"(Norway, Continued) first, and then both of us observed the shining globe above the tree-tops. It moved towards the left, and neared before it landed on the meadow, some 40 m. from the house, and then it disappeared. In fact it was like putting out a parafin lamp, and when I came oustide, there was nothing to be seen. The next day I saw the print in the grass, and the burn marks on the ground. I am 72 years old, but I never saw anything like that.\" Thus Georg Teige related the experience he and his wife had Saturday night July 29, 1978, at one o'clock. He reported the incident to the newspapers \"D.T.\" and \"B.B.\" because a great deal had been written previously about rings in the grass. The diameter of the ring was about 40 cm., and around half of the circle, the grass was burnt. \"There was much dew, and that must be the reason why the grass did not catch fire,\" they said. It was the wife who first woke up from the strong light. She aroused her x husband, who brushed it off with — \"It is nothing but the moon.\" But soon he changed his opinion, and after having tried to stare toward the light, he put on his clothes and shoes in a hurry, and ran to investiate at the landing place.' There was nothing. During the whole event,, the weather was calm. The married couple scarcely dare mention the word \"UFO,\" but they do not really know what to think about the strange episode. Additional informations from the Investigation Section: Mrs. Teige awoke suddenly at 1:00 o'clock on Saturday night. She did not know why, because at this time she used to sleep like a log. She rose, went into the kitchen, and there she saw that the whole kitchen together with the whole courtyard was illuminated. She called her husband and told him about the dreadful light over the courtyard. She describes the light as being like the lamp of a car, and thinks there probably was an indication of some red in the light, outside of the intense white. When she at first discovered the object, it moved about as fast as a cyclist from northeast to northwest, and it also passed behind some trees. The distance to one of the witnesses was now perhaps 60-70 meters. When 10 the husband joined, her, the object came fronv NW in an even course towards the house, as if it took aim at this, and the speed was gradually reduced. The light was now the whole time constant, until it stood about iy 2 meters above the ground and some 25 meters from the house. Then the strength of the light decreased. Then the object landed, and as it hit the ground, the light diminished and made a jump like a feather as it glowed and landed once more, and now 6 meters nearer to the house. About 5 seconds after the jump, the man ran out to see what that could be, but there was nothing. Next morning they both went out to look for marks on the ground, finding that two circles of about 35 cm. in diameter were singed down into the mossy and grass-covered ground. The witnesses remarked that the prints had an oily smell, but this decreased gradually. The prints had no clear/clean outlines, as the object probably did'not stand there for a long time, even though it had a violent radiation of heat. As the witnesses were completely dazzled during the observation, they cannot describe the shape of the object, but they believed that it was round, and that the object had a diameter of about 40 cm., which agree with the prints. Georg adds that the object made a limber landing, and it seemed as if due to conscious behaviour, under control the whole time. There was, no sound during the observation. They had a dog at the farm, but he did not notice the incident: The NUFOC Investigation Section arrived at the place on Monday, July 31, and took soil samples, made measurements, and so on. The incident was not reported to public authorities. Measurings of the samples on August 1, carrried out by means of geiger counter and metal detector, gave negative results. Measuring with geiger counter on August 2 at the spot in question was negative too.

It was a flying object coming from the north and it's shape became clearer as it approached. The object landed on a newly plowed field close by the sports ground, about 100 meters'from the school. Ten seconds later the object rose from the field and left behind three marked tracks in the ground. The object was light green with windows, and behind one of the windows a man was seen by the two boys. They were not able to describe his human-like body in detail, but no doubt about it: There was a humanoid onboard that vehicle. The trustworthiness of the two boys cannot be doubted. In addition to the two boys, one of the attendants at the school also had seen a shining object at the same place, and military authorities confirmed that something (continued on page 15)"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"PLANE DISAPPEARANCE CASE STILL OPEN (The Danish Scandinavian UFO Information organization received the following letter from the Australian Department of Transport in regard to the disappearance of pilot Frederick Valentich in 1978. Reprinted from SUFOINEWS 79/1, Box 6, DK-2820 Gentofte, Denmark. See MUFON UFO Journal No. 129, August 1978.) To begin with, I must apologise for the delay in answering your letter regarding the flight of the Cessna aircraft VII-DSJ which disappeared over Bass Strait on Saturday, 21 October 1978. Firstly, the pilot of the Cessna held an unrestricted private pilot's licence with a night V.M.C. (visual meteorological conditions) endorse- ment. This permitted him to operate at night in conditions which enabled him to have constant reference to the . ground. On 21 October, the pilot filed a carefully prepared flight plan with the Briefing Officer at Moorabbin Airport for a private night VMC (visual meteorological conditions) operation to King Island - and return. The flight was to be conducted outside controlled airspace. He planned his course direct from Moorabbin, Victoria's main general aviation airport, across Port Phillip Bay, to Cape Otway, which is the turning and reporting point for light aircraft about to cross Bass Strait to King Island and Tasmania. The pilot left Moorabbin at 6.19 pm on 21 October and operations to Cape Otway were normal. At .7 pm the pilot reported to Melbourne Flight Service, at Melbourne Airport, Tullamarine, which was working the flight, that he was over Cape Otway. In the absence of any other comment, it must be assumed that nothing untoward was happening to either the aircraft or the pilot at that time. The first indication the pilot gave of any unusual circumstance was at 7.06 when he requested information on any known traffic below 5000 feet in his area. It must be remembered thai the flight, was being made outside controlled airspace and, therefore, as is normal, no radar watch was maintained on it. In any event, the pilot subsequently reported his altitude at 4,500 ft, which at the distance he was from the Melbourne Route Surveillance Radar head at Melbourne Airport (more than 90 miles) he was below the radar scan. When the pilot reported unusual aerial phenomena, the Flight Service Supervisor immediately requested Air Traffic Control to make a particular radar sweep to see whether either the aircraft or the phenomena could be tracked. The night of 21 October was warm and still and temperature inversion was experienced in the Cape Otway area. Additionally, the Otway Ranges hampered the radar scan, as a result, no identifiable return could be seen. Communication with the aircraft was maintained from the time it left Moorabbin until 7.12:28 .(ESST) when unidentifiable noises described subsequently as 'metallic' were heard through the open aircraft microphone and the pilot failed to respond to further calls. At this time, the Search and Rescue distress phase was declared, the Rescue Co-ordination Centre at Melbourne Airport was activated arid arrangements were made to launch a search and rescue mission immediately. A night search by a light aircraft was made covering the last known position of VH-DSJ but nothing further was seen or heard. Subsequent appeals to the public, by radio and the other media for sighting and hearing reports of the aircraft yielded no information relevant to VH-DSJ or the phenomena. The resulting publicity, however, did generate some public response to the newspapers and the Department from people remote from Cape Otway about 'objects in the sky' over Port Phillip Bay and along the bayside. Two independent groups camping near the Cape Otway light did report hearing a light aircraft in their area at 'about the time' but as neither of the groups had a watch they could not determine the exact time. Neither of these groups noticed any unusual aerial activity at the time. While the Department, is still investigating the 'incident' — as no wreckage has been found it is not classified as 'accident' — naturally it has no official comment on the probable cause of the disappearance. Unofficially, however, and I must stress that this is my personal opinion and not, repeat not, that of the Department — the pilot, 20 years old was not an experienced pilot. He had about 150-200 hours total flying time. He had not long held the night VMC rating; his night flying was extremely limited and this was his first night flight over water. His flight plan, according to the Briefing Officer at Moorabbin was very carefully prepared for a two way flight to King Island. However, by design, or inexperience, he did not arrange to have the King Island aerodrome lights turned on for his arrival. He had an ETA at King Island of 7.28 pm. The Department's file on the missing aircraft is still open and, because no wreckage has been found, (continued on page 15) 11"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"UFO SECRECY UPDATE: THE UFO PAPER CHASE By Larry W. Bryant Back in the sixties, when the Federal Government's UFO- investigation program was swimming in a sea of indecision/foulup/coverup, an occasionally enterprising reporter or other journalist would raise the periscope enough to get a clear view of things. One such observer, Mort Young (author of UFO: Top Secret, published in 1967 by Essandess Special Editions, NYC), observed: Flying saucers have presented us with an ideal reason to explore the misty realms of Government. Because all UFO material is supposedly available to the public, the field of inquiry is open to every citizen of the United States. Yet when the Government is contacted and asked about UFO's, the knowledge gained is not about UFO's but about how the Government really operates day to day. Unfortunately, what was an astute appraisal 13 years ago applies even today. Despite the qualified success of the freedom-of-information lawsuit of Ground Saucer Watch, Inc. Vs. U.S. Central Intelligence Agency — by which the UFOlogy community again can say, \"See, you are so withholding vital UFO-related records!\" — despite that picked-over, censored, and otherwise suspect package of several hundred documents released pursuant to the suit, we're still cloutless when it comes to making the Government accountable for what it's done, doing, and laid plans to do in the UFO- research arena. A battle has been won, so to speak; but the war continues. Amidst the skirmishing and the noting of casualties, we now have a report from the front line. It comes to us in the form of a press release, based on more-or-less ineffectual press conference held at the Bronx, N.Y., offices of GSW's counsel, Peter A. Gersten, on October 25, 1979. It was ineffectual not because Gersten had 12 failed to do his homework for the documentation shpw-and-tell. Its weakness, rather, was, that its total message amounted to ho-hum news — a tired old record being played by a new disco-jockey. Flashy, yes; juicy, no. As a result, there was a modicum of media presence at the conference. An NYC TV news reporter was there to seek a new angle, I understand. But in general the audience consisted of UFO- oriented writers who had been alerted via the grapevine. In effect, Gersten ended up delivering his message within a play-back mode. That brings to mind the reason why publisher Ralph Ginzberg abandoned his lively magazine FACT: \"We found in our readership surveys that we are writing to ourselves, and thus were a terminal audience\" — or words to that effect. Anyway, for the benefit of you who weren't present at the conference to snap up copies of the 6-page press release and its accompanying \"press kit\" of key official leaked/released documents, I'll try to summarize them here. Citing the aggregate of 3,000 pages of UFO-related documents acquired in a year's time from the Departments of State/Army/Navy/Air Force, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Central Intelligence Agency, the National Security Agency, and the Defense Intelligence.Agency, Gersten's press release credits the now dormant public-interest group Citizens Against UFO Secrecy (CAUS) with a continuing analysis of the documentation. In Gersten's words, \"CAUS can now report that the documents expose the policy of this government to debunk reports of UFO sightings by the public and of thereby succeeding in minimizing their significance.\" This and other accusations in the press release are keyed to the documents reproduced via the press .kit. (See the accompanying table for listing of documents.) According to the press release, the CIA and NSA currently \"admit to withholding 57 and 18 UFO documents, respectively. Furthermore, the CIA refuses to acknowledge at least 200 other UFO documents that were in its possession, while NSA refuses to acknowledge the existence of any of its UFO documents. Presently the Air Force is withholding all information relating to 'unknown tracks,' its latest synonym for UFO's.\" In dealing with this official intransigence, the press release announces Gersten's plans, under the CAUS commitment, to pursue freedom-of-information litigation against the ;NSA and USAF. \"Futhermore,\" says Gersten, \"within 30 days, as part of the Ground Saucer Watch lawsuit against CIA, I will be asking the U.S. District Court in Washington to enjoin the CIA from withholding the 57 documents it refuses to release.\" The press release concludes by calling upon Congress \"to exercise its oversight powers and launch a full-scale inquiry into whether the Government has thoroughly investigated the threat to national security that some UFO's may pose.\" It asks that the Federal Government respond positively to the following demands, which CAUS considers will be echoed by the general public: • Reverse the official position that further scientific investigation of UFO's is unwarranted • Immediately declassify and release . all official UFO documents that do not legitimately affect national security (continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"(Secrecy, Continued) • Unconditionally waive all search and copying fees for UFO documents. As to the public's role in this protracted UFO paper chase, the press release calls upon the American people \"to come forward with any information concerning UFO's and this government's suppression of UFO evidence.\" With this milestone in the politics of UFOIogy, can we predict that the new decade of the eighties will be known as the Age of UFO Enlightenment? Perhaps... especially if CAUS/Gersten can acquire the financial backing and public support that the ongoing and planned litigation demands. And especially if we can diminish this truism expressed by Mort Young in his book UFO: Top Secret: Government-sponsored studies pertaining to extraterrestrial life have shown that UFO's are extremely bad politics. Their effects can be damaging: so severe, in fact, that more than one government would topple. Political stability cannot be guaranteed if these ridiculous-seeming flying saucers are actually journeying from another world; even to admit the possibility is tantamount to political suicide. Consider: Would you vote for a Presidential candidate who had as a platform plank the promise to get to the bottom of the UFO mystery, who stated he would employ the Army, Navy, and Air Force as UFO hunters when and where necessary? No political party could survive the nomination of such a candidate. Who would dare vote for a maniac?

Made available apparently in a lapse of forethought to researcher Robert Todd, this curious, 7-page survey of the philosophical side of official UFOIogy bears no author's by-line and, in this rough-draft form, contains no references to any other NSA-produced literature on UFOIogy. Bearing the subject \"Summary of Observations of Aerial Phenomena in the New Mexico Area, December 1948 - May 1950,\" this formerly CONFIDENTIAL, 3-page letter (minus 4 inclosures) contains possible leads to as-yet-unreleased UFO documentation. One of these might be RAND Corporation Report EHO-41 (25 July 1951), titled \"Report of Aerial Phenomena, Holloman AFB, 21 February 1950 through 31 April 1951,\" by Edward T. Doty. (Efforts are underway to acquire a copy of the RAND document, and if any reader knows its whereabouts, (s)he is encouraged to contact this column.) In addition to exposing the U.S. intelligence community's behind-the-scenes concern about the ostensible myth of flying saucers, this classic factor in the evolution of the politics of UFOIogy also confirms the veiled CIA references contained in the 1956 book The Report on Unidentified Flying Objects, by former USAF Project Blue Book chief Capt. Edward J. Ruppelt. Among the recipients of this telegram about Algerian UFO sightings were the U.S. Commander-in-Chief, Europe; the Commander-in-Chief, U.S. Navy, Europe; and the Commander, U.S. Navy Sixth Fleet. It is not known whether any of these addressees bothered to respond to the embassy's plea for a \"serious reply\" by which to explain to Algerian officials the origin of the reported strange \"machines.\" This and the five associated documents listed below formed the basis for the serious interest shown by The Washington Post and The New York Times in the late-1975 \"unknown air activity\" over/near U.S. military installations.

On November 2 pictures were taken and samples of the soil sent to the laboratory to find if they contained radioactivity. After the samples had been taken, the Norwegian UFO expert Dag Heim was convinced that something unusual must have landed on the field. One of the reasons is that the grade of acidity in the soil is much higher than the surrounding ground (soil). This must be because of the landing, and is by the way not unusual on these landing prints, rather a rule. A Swedish UFO expert, Karl Karlson Backman, who also has visited the place and made investigations, is convinced that the boys must have seen a real UFO. Dag Heim has sent a report to Ringerike police office. On the basis of this report it will be decided whether the War Defence ought to be involved in the case. The UFO case has aroused a great commotion in Ringerike and lots of people have been visiting the place. Gypsum casts were taken of the landing print, and these were comparatively usable. The samples show that the foot-formed print is caused by an object with a curved bottom — i.e., the print is slightly U- shaped. The length of the gypsum cast is 36 cm in the longest dimension, about 14.5 at the broadest and about 7 cm at the narrowest. The height is 10cm. The narrowest side points toward the center which is common to all the prints. (Secrecy, Continued) CIA letter to Peter A.

Box 615, Sedalia, MO 65301. Periodic reports will be submitted to MUFON for publication. These reports will include cases in general and analysis results to keep you informed. The Research Group will provide a means for analysis of UFO related traces. Members of the Group will receive information on sampling techniques and a copy of the Ten Year Report. Ten Year Physical Trace Report Since the trace catalog (TraCat) was initiated 10 years ago, the author has gathered 1,525 reports from 52 countries. A study of reports from TraCat is nearly complete and should be released in early January, 1980. A number of significant statistical facts are obvious in the preliminary study. Physical trace reports show a marked increase beginning in 1964. Since then such cases have increased at a constant rate. During the 10-year period 1950-1959, cases averaged 17.7 a year; from 1960-1969 they increased to 45.6 per year. From 1970-1979, cases averaged 63.5 yearly. Most physical trace reports occur in October, followed by July and September. The UFOs involved were most often observed between 9 and 10 p.m. 49 per cent of the events took place between 8 p.m. and midnight. The UFO emitted sound in 8.4% of the reports, most often described as a humming or whistling sound. Light beams have been reported, projecting from the object to the ground before or after a landing. Humanoids were observed in 14.3% of the events; 71% of the humanoids were less than normal in height. Effects (animal, human, electrical) were reported in 14.1% of the reports. 39.2% of the reports involve two or more witnesses. 25.7% of the multiple witness events involve several witnesses. 39% of the witnesses were within 50 feet of the landed or nearly landed object. 64.6% of the witnesses were within 250 feet of the UFO. 43% reported an observation of from 1 to 5 minutes while 8.6% observed the object for 30 minutes to 1 hour. 65% of the witnesses were male, 35% female. Witnesses occupations: police officers, military officers, priests, farmers, professional engineers, airline pilots, and physics professors. 74% of the UFOs were described as being disc-shaped. 34% were metallic in color. Outstanding UFO features were ports or windows, domed upper section, external lights, light beams, vapor or smoke, and high speed vertical ascent. There is a definite indication that two major types of objects are being seen. Type One has a diameter of 8 to 12 feet; Type Two has a diameter of 30 to 35 feet. The first type is generally described as having a brightly glowing surface and does not make ground contact. The Type One event does not involve humanoids. The second type is the typical disc with a metallic surface, slightly domed top, flattened base. External lights are seen along with openings or vents. Many of the descriptions include a three or four- legged landing gear. 77% of the landing sites were circular with diameters from 4 to 45 feet. These areas are described as burnt (49%), depressed (33%) or dehydrated (18%). Perhaps the most interesting cases are the dehydrated sites. Many of the sites would not absorb water for up to one year after the reported event. The sites were most often found to be either 5 to 15 feet or 30 to 35 feet in diamter. In many cases, the central area shows no change, creating a ring. 10% of the sites also have imprints arranged in a triangle (61%) or , rectangle (39%). In conjunction with the primary effects, fluid, footprints, and tree damage are frequently reported. The midwestern section of the United States has been found to be quite active. In reviewing the distribution of physical trace landing cases in this country, it was found that the leading states are Missouri, Iowa, California, Ohio, Kansas, and New York, in that order. Landing sites have been reported in 47 states to date. The 72 high strangeness reports from this catalog have been discussed in a separate article. 16"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"NET NEWS By David L. Dobbs, K8NQN MUFON AMATEURK RADIO SSB NETS: SATURDAY 7237 KHz 1300 UTC N1JS 3975KHz 1400 UTC WA9ARG The holiday season brought joy to the heart and a multitude of amateur radio operators to their microphones. QRM (interference from other stations) was at a high level. Despite the continued lull in UFO sightings, with perseverance some .interesting traffic was passed on the MUFON sets. PY2UAW is a young man named Hilton in Sao Paulo, Brazil. A contact on 15 meter CW (code) early last year resulted in correspondence about UFOs. In a recent letter, Hilton reported on the First International Congress of Ufology which was held in Brasilia from October 26 to 30. Walt Andrus, you will recall, mentioned this event in the September issue. Translating from Folha de Sao Paulo, Hilton wrote that the congress was attended by more than 800 people including Dr. J. Allen Hynek from the United States. A highlight of the presentations involved an incident confirmed by the Brazilian Air Force. Clocked by flight controllers at 3900 km/hr, a UFO literally flew circles around an Air Force jet. After being joined by .three other objects, the UFOs moved around the plane, appearing first on one side, then the other, then in front. The flight was en route from Brasilia to Sao Paulo. The article translated by PY2UAW concluded with an intriguing remark by one of the speakers, Sanches Bueno from Spain. He was quoted as saying, \"The government of the United States doesn't give any information about UFOs because they want to capture a UFO and with its technology dominate the world!\" Hilton's communication was reported to the 40 meter net on November 10. We enjoyed an unusual check-in by W9EQT, Dan McKee of Decatur, Illinois. Dan has been experimenting with techniques for recording mysterious voices using an open microphone and background of white noise. When one of the voices advised him to \"use single sideband,\" he succeeded in capturing statements purporting to originate from orbiting space ships. Strangely, the voices were clearly audible when the tapes were played backward. Following the net on November 24th, Dan broadcast a portion of one of his tapes for some of us. Intelligible words were loud and clear. Dan told us that the voices don't answer questions directly, but only with another question. Consequently little useful information has been obtained so far. Hopefully W9EQT will update us on his experiments in the future, which some will recognize as an extension of the Raudive method for recording \"voices of the dead.\" (Or a leg-pull.--Editor) Bill Armstrong, WONC, reported his impressions of the new book, UFO Contact with the Pleiades, Vol. 1. It contains many color photos of UFOs of undocumented origin, and its price will discourage the casually curious. Relayed by WONC, WA5CTJ kept the net informed about the new group in San Antonio. Bill also described an investigation conducted by the group, having received a copy of the report from Elmer. On the last net of the old year, Bill abstracted some interesting clippings he had received from Joe Brill. The Christchurch, New Zealand press on December 5 reported an apparent abduction which occurred in France. In a small town northwest of Paris, some friends were packing their car to leave on a trip before dawn on November 26. A bright object of tennis-ball size approached the car and came to rest on the hood. One man ran into the house to get his camera. When he returned, his friend who had remained in the car had disappeared. The friend reappeared a week later, but thought that only 5 minutes had elapsed! So far net members have seen no other reports on this fascinating incident. (MUFON . has received clippings indicating that authorities suspect a hoax. We are monitoring the situation.- -Editor) Dr. Armstrong, who is a member of the National Enquirer Award Panel, told the net that the panel would be meeting in Las Vegas, probably on March 15-16, to select the UFO case of the year for 1979. He also reported that his lecture on UFOs to top business leaders of St. Louis at the Missouri Athletic Club had been very well received on December 28. A new UFO net was born on January 5 in the ten meter band. At 2000 UTC (3 PM EST), propagation was so good that heavy activity around 28.8 MHz forced the net down to 28.790 to find a clear frequency. With two other Cincinnati stations on hand, net control KA8BVO and 'K8NQN were pleased to hear WA5RON check in from Austin, Texas. \"RON\" is Jerry (Continued on page 19) 17"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"THREE BOYS FOUND UFO NEAR CATTLE SHED (Translation from Bintang Timur, Penang, Malaysia, 30 May 1979, submitted by Ahmad Jamaludin.) KULIM, Tues. — Two adults and three boys in Kampung Naga Lilit, 17 miles from here claimed to have seen an unidentified object (UFO) recently. (May 26, 1979--Editor.) The object was round as a tray with three legs and emitting rays of various colors when seen near a cattle shed in this village last Saturday. When observed the object, about IY 2 feet above the ground, was moving slowly pace by pace in a hovering fashion. Those who claimed to have seen the object were two students of the Padang Serai National Secondary School, a pupil of the National Tamil School near the village and two adults, A. Muniandy, 27, and Raja Kumar, 41, who works as cowherd and milker. The boys, Vijaya Kumaran, 14, A. Kumar, 15, and K. Kumarlinggam, 10, claimed that the object glowed very brightly which made their vision temporarily darkened. Vijaya Kumaran said they sighted the unidenified object while they were playing near the cattle shed. \"While we were playing we saw an unidentified object moving slowly about 1% feet from the ground. The object emitted rays in various colors which shone into the eyes, had three landing gears but all three legs of the object did not touch the ground.\" According to him, he approached the object and tried to touch it but suddenly a beam of intense light shot out from the outer rim of the object and hit his eyes and as a result he felt his vision darkened. Both his friends also tried to touch the object but the object released the identical beam which hit both their eyes. According to Vijaya Kumaran, immediately after that they cried for help and it happened at that time A. Muniandy and Raja Kumar were nearby and rushed to the scene. After listening to the story from the students, Raja Kumar went to the mentioned site about 50 feet from the cattle shed and he managed to see the object. According to Raja Kumar when he approached he saw an object a little smaller than a tray moving slowly into the jungle nearby. \"I was afraid to follow the object into the jungle after hearing the story from the students,\" he said.

From the author of the book \"Science, the Public and the UFO\" (1967), we now have Arthur Bray's latest — \"The UFO Connection\" (1979) published by Jupiter Publishing, P.O. Box 5528, Postal Station F, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada K2C SMI. This well- documepted book on the status of UFO research in Canada in particular and the remainder of the world represents 32 years of investigative work conducted by Mr. Bray. Arthur Bray is one.of the pioneers in UFO research in Canada and presents a considerable amount of information on the research accomplished by Wilbert B. Smith. Mr. Bray has subscribed to the MUFON UFO Journal since 1978, however, he does not quote any references from this publication in his book. It is recommended reading for the serious UFO investigator. The quality softback is available for $8.50. 18 \"The Roswell Incident\" by Charles Berlitz and William L. Moore is more on the UFO Crash/Retrieval Syndrome, but relates primarily to one event occurring in Roswell, N.M., in July 1947 of an alleged UFO crash landing. It has been published by Grosset and Dunn, however, I have not had the pleasure of seeing an advanced copy. As related earlier in this message, Bill Moore is a MUFON State Section Director. I did have an opportunity to visit with him, at length, at \"UFO 79\" and found that he has been \"doing his homework\" on \"The Philadelphia Experiment\" and \"The Roswell Incident\". In the June 1979 issue of the Journal, the featured article covered the important segments of the Parlimentary Debates before the British House of Lords on Unidentified Flying Objects. This UFO debate initiated by the Earl of Clancarty (Brinsley Le Pouer Trench) fills about 70 pages of the House of Lords \"Official Report.\" The entire report may now be purchased for £3.25p including post and packing from Pentacle Books, 6 Perry Road, Bristol 1, England. If you enjoyed the paper presented by David Stupple, Ph.D., entitled \"Contactees, Cults, and Cultures\" at the 1979 MUFON UFO Symposium, you will find the small paperback \"The UFO Cults\" by Weldon Burge of further interest. It may be secured from Pamphlet Publications, 10857 Reading Road, P.O. Box 41372A, Cincinnati, Ohio 45241 for $2.20. Tom Adams, MUFON authority on animal mutilations, has advised that his publication STIGMATA will be a quarterly publication in 1980, beginning with the next issue, No. 8 (Spring 1980) with a price increase to $5.00 for the four 1980 issues. You may subscribe by writing to Project Stigma, P.O. Box 1094, Paris, TX 75460 U.S.A. There definitely appears to be a relationship between UFO sightings and some animal mutilations, therefore people interested in this aspect will find STIGMATA intriguing reading."},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"Lucius Farish In Others' Words Chilean Air Force jet pilots have had various encounters with UFOs, according to an article in the December 25 NATIONAL ENQUIRER. A photograph of one huge triangular UFO accompanies the article. A 1978 UFO abduction case from West Germany is detailed in the January 8 ENQUIRER. Italian security guard Fortunate Zanfretta now claims to have been abducted by UFO beings on four separate occasions, according to the ENQUIRER'S January 15 issue. This issue also contains the opinions of Erich von Daniken and Charles Hapgood concerning ancient advanced civilizations. A fireball UFO with intense magnetic power was responsible for considerable damage to buildings in Islampur, India; full details are presented in the January 22 ENQUIRER issue. The December issue of AMERICAN HERITAGE has been an interesting summary of the \"airship\" report from California in November and December, 1896. Drawings from contemporary newspapers are included, along with editorial cartoons. James Oberg's \"UFO Update\" column in February OMNI deals with the various scientific opinions regarding extraterrestrial life (or the lack of it) and how such views bear on speculations of UFO origins. The February issue of GALLERY has an interesting article by Art Gatti on the various CIA, Air Force, Department of Defense, and other official documents which relate to UFOs and which have now been released to the public. A new 2-album record set, \"UFO Encounters,\" presents an interesting selection of testimonies and opinions by UFO witnesses and researchers. Contributors to the album include Kenneth Arnold, Colonel Robert Friend (former Project Blue. Book Director), Bill Pecha, Ted Phillips, Travis Walton, Father William Gill, Herbert Schirmer, former Air Force Major Paul A. Duich, Louise Smith, Leonard Stringfield, Dr. R. Leo Sprinkle, Betty Hill, Marjorie Fish, Stanton Friedman, former astronaut Gordon Cooper, Jacques Vallee, David Saunders, and others. An additional bonus is President Carter's personal recounting of his 1969 UFO sighting. A special section inside the album cover contains 6 pages of UFO photographs, plus photos of most of the persons heard in the records. Some of the material relating to \"crashed saucer\" stories seem questionable, but all in all, this is a good selection of recorded UFO material.

(New News, Continued) Johnson, MUFON's amateur radio director for Texas as~ well .as?:/a consultant for South America. We enjoyed talking to Jerry again, having had the pleasure of meeting him at the 1978 MUFON symposium in Dayton. Socorro, New Mexcio! From that portentious QTH (location) KA5CNE advised the Saturday Afternoon UFO Net and Roundtable that local activity was currently limited to cattle mutilations. Paul, who worked for a radio station in Alamosa, Colorado, at the time of the first publicized animal mutilation, participated in the investigation. Remember Snippy, the horse, back in 1967? Paul told us that the famous UFO landing of April 24, 1964, remains a topic of conversation in the Socorro area. Lonnie Zamora, the chief witness, still lives in Socorro but is no longer with the police force. Paul is a technician at the VLA (Very Large Array), the world's largest radio telescope now nearing completion. He promised to keep the net advised of future developments in his area. Following net operations, W7TLA, who had been monitoring, gave me a call from Great Falls, Montana. Orv reported that cattle mutilations continue to be a major problem in that area as well. A number of recent sasquatch sightings along the Missouri River have caused some concern, he said. Future sessions of this independent net will be held on or around 28.795 MHz on Saturdays at 2000 UTC. It is hoped that more of the stations who were listening will check in, with or without UFO traffic. California amateurs are particularly invited. Information of merit will be reported to the MUFON nets the following week, and in this column, n CORRECTION A letter from Joe Santangelo, MUFON State Director for Massachusetts, supplements and corrects the story of the Massachusetts sighting published in the October Journal (case report MA 79-7). He says that the exact location of the event is significant. It occurred on Martha's Vineyard in Duke County, which is an island just off the coast of Massachusetts. Although, as State Director, Santangelo submitted the story to the Journal, he says that credit for the investigation goes to Joe Nyman, a member of MUFON's Norfolk County team, who traveled to the scene by ferry and carried on the investigation at his personal expense. The name of the witness is Wesley Grunden, not Gruman as reported in the Journal.--Mildred Biesele 19"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"DIRECTOR'S MESSAGE by Walt Andrus Illobrand von Ludwiger, Director of MUFON-CES, and Michael Sinclair, International Coordinator, are elated to announce that the eminent Theodore Auerbach, Ph.D., Staldenstr. 7, CH- 5412 Gebenstorf, Switzerland is our new Representative for Switzerland. Dr. Auerbach, a professor of physics at the university in Zurich, has devoted his UFO research to the application of physics, and Burkhard Heim's theory in particular, to UFO propulsion. Recognized worldwide, Dr. Auerbach has been a frequent speaker at the annual MUFON-CES UFO symposium in West Germany. William L. Moore, P.O. Box 189, Dewey, AZ 86327, a former State Section Director in Minnesota, has been appointed to the same responsibility for Yavapai County in Arizona. Bill is probably best known as a co-author with Charles Berlitz of \"The Philadelphia Experiment\" and \"The Roswell Incident.\" He has traveled extensively throughout the U.S.A. assimilating information for his books. Hal Starr, 312 W. Frier Drive, Phoenix, AZ 85021 has volunteered his services as a Research Specialist in Public Education. Hal, a radio-TV writer and performer, organized the recent successful \"UFO 79\" conference in San Diego, Calif. John F. Schuessler, Deputy Director of Administration for the Mutual UFO Network and Chairman for the 1980 MUFON UFO Symposium on June 7 and 8 in Houston (Clear Lake City, Texas) has confirmed the following speakers for this international event: R.

Montieth, Ph.D., Albuquerque, N.M.; Richard Niemtzow, M.D., Houston, Texas; and James Oberg, Dickinson, Texas. Each of the presented papers will be oriented to the theme of the symposium, \"Technology and the UFO.\" Stan Friedman has appropriately titled his paper, \"Flying Saucer Technology.\" All speeches will be delivered on Saturday, June 7th at the spacious Clear Lake High School on Bay Area Blvd. Beautiful hotel and motel accomodations are available across the street from the NASA L.B. Johnson Space Center on NASA Road ttl where the symposium headquarters will be set up. The Annual MUFON Corporate Meeting, Sunday morning June 8th, and the tour of the Space Center on Sunday afternoon will originate from the hotel complex. The tour of NASA's largest and newest research and development facility will include movies in the Exhibit Area; Mission Control; and Mission Simulation and Training. Participants will be able to view a Saturn V rocket, all 3 stages; a Redstone rocket with a mockup of the Mercury Capsule, and a Little Joe II rocket with an Apollo command module and service module topped off by the launch escape system. The nucleus of the members of VISIT (Vehicular Internal Systems Investigative Team), the host group for this symposium, are all employed and work at the Space Center, so anticipate a personalized tour. Under the direction of Raymond E. Fowler, MUFON is in the process of up- dating and revising the material for the third edition of the \"Field Investigator's Manual.\" Many of the original consultants who prepared complete sections on their area of expertise have been invited to submit their revisions so the manual may reflect the \"state-of-the -art\" as of 1980. Several new sections will be added to include new techniques, tools, and methods for investigation that have been developed within the past 5 years. As a guideline for those individuals who have been invited to update their present material and to the others who plan to write new sections, a deadline for submission of material has been established for September 1, 1980. Since we have an adequate supply of the present Field Investigator's Manuals, the third edition will not be published until early in 1981. Please submit your papers directly to MUFON in Seguin, Texas, and they will be forwarded to Mr. Fowler, MUFON Director of Investigations. Due to popular demand, the July and August 1978 issues of the MUFON UFO Journal, which contained Leonard Stringfield's two-part article \"Retrievals of the Third Kind,\" are now out of supply. MUFON still has an adequate supply of the 1978 MUFON UFO Symposium Proceedings that includes Mr. Stringfield's original paper on this subject for $6.00 in the U.S.A. and $7.00 in all other countries. After interviewing numerous first party witnesses to crashed UFOs and recovering of small bodies now in government possession, Leonard Stringfield has written a new booklet titled \"The UFO Crash/Retrieval Syndrome\" — Satus Report II: New Sources, New Data, published by the Mutual UFO Network, Inc. Since the booklet has been typeset and is now in the proofreading stage as of January 21, 1980, we confidently expect it to be available for sale by March 1,1980. The Table of Contents follows. Part I: The Firsthand Witness Report: A Study of Humanoids and the Anonymous Human Factor; Part II: New Support Data; Part III: Statistical Analysis of UFO Crash/Retrieval Events; Epilogue; and Attachments: Drawing of Humanoid Based on Medical Data, 1979; Drawing of Humanoid Head, 1978; Concepts of Human Physiology by Tom Deuley; etc. You may secure a copy of Mr. Stringfield's diligent and patient research into one of our government's most closely guarded secrets by sending a money order, (continued on page 18)"}]
