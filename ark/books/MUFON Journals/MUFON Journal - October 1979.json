FROM THE EDITOR The Journal is not — and will not be under my editorship — a \"Bible for believers.\" We are not convinced that reported abductions are real, that hypnosis is a reliable tool for establishing the truth, that the psychological stress cvaluator or the polygraph (\"lie detector\") are unquestionably reliable instruments, that computer enhancement of UFO photographs can : often establish their validity, or that there is any simple short-cut to truth anywhere. The burden of proof is on those who make such extravagant claims or who by their actions clearly make such assumptions. The road to truth is a difficult one involving dialogue, dissent, logic, hypotheses, and empirical facts. We welcome critiques of any articles or reports published here, for we are not reporting dogma. Theories based on structures of sand, particularly, deserve criticism. The vagaries of human psychology and the known unreliability of hypnosis as a guarantor of truth combine to make abduction reports a knotty problem for investigation. Those who accept them as valid presently must be considered supremely naive. That is not to say that all are false, but simply that, if true, proof will be very difficult. So far all we have are mutually contradictory stories without proof. In this issue DELEGATES FROM J.S.P.S.

The delegation was headed by Shinichiro Namiki, President of J.S.P.S. The following men spent a few hours visiting with the International Director, making group photographs, and purchasing back issues of SKYLOOK and MUFON UFO Symposium Pro- ceedings for 1973, 1975, 1976, 1977, 1978 and 1979: Hiroshi Kitajima (employed by INTEL Japan K.K.), Niwa Kozo, Satoshi Ohtsuki, and Tadashi Kosaku. All of these men live in Tokyo except Niwa Kozo who resides in Aichi-Ken. Since all five of them are currently subscibers to the MUFON UFO JOURNAL, they were very interested in obtaining copies of SKYLOOK prior to June 1976 when the name of our monthly magazine was changed to better reflect the organization's name and professional caliber of the contents. The enthusiasm which these gentlemen expressed during their visit was far beyond my expectations. They feel that the United States is more advanced in UFO research than Japan, therefore they are anxious to read as much of our scientific data as possible. After being guests of MUFON, the group drove to Austin, Texas to visit Project Starlight International, hosted by Ray Stanford, the Director, on ' Sunday afternoon. As the interpreter for the group, Peter Tomikawa translated their individual statements when they enthusiastically said 'Visiting MUFON was a dream coming true.\" It was an honor to have these gentlemen visit our office in Seguin, Texas, although they had previously viewed portions of it on a Japanese TV network program in October 1978. Both the 1978 and 1979 MUFON symposiums have been featured in the leading Japanese news stand magazine \"UFOs and Space\", therefore their comment was \"Everybody knows about MUFON in Japan.\" Peter Tomikawa is to be congratulated for providing color photographs and a review of the speakers' presentations to the Magazine in Japan. Twelve pages were devoted to the 1978 MUFON symposium in Dayton, Ohio. The cover page for the article was a reproduction of the 1978 MUFON Symposium Proceedings cover designed by Donald Tucker, depicting close encounters of the first, second, third, and fourth kinds. MUFON's Sectional Director for the southern Japanese islands, Mr. Takao Ikeda, also a member of J.S.P.S., was unable to make this visit therefore their President, Mr. Namiki spoke for him and relayed his personal greeting from MUFON-Japan. MUFON AUTOMOBILE LICENSE PLATES By Walt Andrus In the states of Texas, California and several others, special auto license plates may be obtained 'with any combination of six letters and numbers so as to personalize the identification. Starting in 1953 when Illinois first permitted amateur radio call letters on license plates, your director always had plates with his F.C.C. assigned call' letters \"W9KRC\". Since moving to Texas in 1975 and receiving new amateur call letters -- W5VRN, I elected to take advantage of the personalized privileges in Texas and requested -- what else \"MUFON\", feeling that this was far more significant as a means of identification. Other MUFON members in Texas could request MUFON \"1 through 9\" if they so desired for their automobiles giving greater flexibility and range. John F. Schuessler, Deputy Director, has the personalized license plates \"UFO-NUT\" which creates considerable conversation at the NASA Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center where he works. At the 1979 MUFON Symposium in Burlingame, Calif., your director noted a vehicle parked in front of the Airport Marina Hotel with California license plates \"MUFON\", but I was unable to identify the owner, (probably one of our State Section Directors). Marvin E. Taylor, Assistant State Director for Northern California combined the study of the phenomena with his initials and has \"UFO-MET\", however this has caused filling station operators to ask him \"when he met a UFO?\" Victor Johnston, formerly living near Oklahoma City, had the Oklahoma license plates \"UFO\", but now has conventional plates after moving to Mineral Wells, Texas. Our Japanese visitors always take pictures of my license plates as a momento of their visit to MUFON. Yu \"Masaru\" Mori, MUFON Sectional Director for Northern Japan, was our first visitor to take photographs back to Japan. Personally, I am proud to be identified with MUFON -- how about you?"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"CANARY ISLANDS SIGHTING: CYLINDRICAL OBJECT PHOTOGRAPHED By William G. Hinrichsen (MUFON Continental Coordinator for South America) (The following account of a sighting over the Canary Islands, was told to Mr. Hinrichsen by Mr. Guillermo N. Lijtmaer on August 8, 1979, during a personal interview in Laguna Niguel, Calif. Whether or not the phenomenon was UFO related remains to be determined. A rocket or missile firing cannot be ruled out at this stage.-- Editor) ' , Mr. Guillermo N; Lijtrnaer, a professional photographer from Buenos Aires, Argentina, had been traveling through Europe with his wife and two small daughters since November 1978. On March 5,1979, he was in.the Canary Islands; on the west coast of Tenerife, to be precise. , That evening, Mr. Lijtrnaer was on the, roof -of the apartment, building where he was staying, taking pictures of an extraordinary display of colors in the sky. 1 All the colors of the spectrum could be observed which had formed a pattern of concentric spirals (elliptical shape). This display lasted for about 45 minutes in the black sky, since the sun had .already disappeared below the horizon. Mr. Lijtrnaer took a total of five pictures of the lights; one each time that the pattern seemed to change in shape and intensity. It was close to 7:30 PM when he decided to come down from the roof. On the way to his apartment he was met by one of the residents of the apartment complex who asked him to come in and watch the UFO from his window. Mr. Lijtrnaer responded, \"What UFO? Those are just lights in the sky.\" The neighbor told him to wait and that he would be able to see a UFO. He said that he knew this because he had seen the same phenomenon a few years before in another country. By this time the colors in the sky had started to dissipate, diminishing in.intensity. .

This might possible corroborate the statement made to the National Enquirer (July 24,1979) by airline pilot Eufronio Garcia Monforto, who was climbing out of 8,700 feet from Grand Canary bound for Mauritania, Africa. \"It was on a collision course with us, but it suddenly changed heading and began to climb at fantastic speed.\" He saw it. as \"cigar-shaped (and) metallic.\" (continued on next page)"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"MINDALORE CASE FOLLOW-UP By Cynthia Hind (MUFON Field Investigator) (This South African landing case was reported in Journal No. 134, Mar.-Apr. 1979--Editor) You will recall that in the Meagan and Andre Quezet case at Mindalore, near Krugersdorp, South Africa, on the night of January 3/4 of this year, Meagan's story was discredited by Frank Morton, NICAP investigator in South Africa. Morton gave several . reasons: (a) The neighbors (I have been unable to find out if only one neighbor was involved, or several) reported that Meagan was \"highly imaginative.\" (b) She did not immediately wake her husband Paul to tell him of her experience. (I have already explained that Paul was not a well man and an insomniac. I also feel that rapport between husband and wife'is not too good.) (c) There were no physical marks left on the tarmac where the craft was supposed to have landed. (d) Morton said Meagan would (Canary Islands, Continued) was heard before, during, or after the sighting. Mr. Lijtmaer did not have a chance to fully see the spectacle because he was busy setting up the camera on the tripod and taking pictures. He was able to obtain three photographs before it vanished. Mr. Lijtmaer used a Nikon EL camera with automatic exposure, and Fuji film ASA 100. Preliminary Spanish investigations placed the event, which had been seen from four different islands, at a distance of approximately 200 km. not take a lie-detector test. (This is not true. She agreed to this when I saw her on the llth January.) (e) Morton said Meagan would not undergo hypnosis. (This ' was true at the time as she believed it would prove harmful. I did not try and persuade her; I merely pointed out the benefits and assured her she would come to no harm. After some,thought, she agreed but wanted me to be there.) I live in Zimbabwe-Rhodesia 1,250 kms from Johannesburg, and it is not easy to fly down there at a moment's notice. However, I was invited to do a UFO documentary with the S.A. Broadcasting Corporation in Durban and I found that I could fly via Johannesburg at no extra cost. I managed to contact Dr. Bernard Levinson, an eminent psychiatrist, who, at the request of the NATIONAL ENQUIRER, had worked with the four boys involved in the Groendal Reserve case. (See Journal No. 131, Oct. 1978.) He agreed to regress Megan during the 24 hours I would be in Johannesburg. I met Meagan on the morning of the 21st June and at 11 a.m. we arrived at Dr. Levinson's office. The actual regression was taped, and I am giving you a full transcript of this. As the case progressed, I realized that Meagan was often repeating words that were addressed to her. To clarify this position, I am underlining these par- ticular words. I must also point out that I have not interrupted Meagan's speech with questions from the psychiatrist where I have felt this was not necessary. It would only spoil the continuity. I would also like you to bear in mind that Dr. Levinson is not involved in the UFO question and knows very little about it. There were many questions which could have been asked and I want to try and have a follow-up to this initial regression. Also, I would like to persuade Meagan to allow Dr. Levinson to regress Andre, but I doubt if she will allow that. Meagan: There's a strange light. I'm walking towards it with Andre.

Dr. Levinson agreed to record his conclusions on tape and I quote him verbatim: I must say this is a strange recording. The impression I have is that this is an hysterical fantasy. The hypnosis seems to have spun her into a kind of disassociated state in which she could allow her fantasy complete rein, . even to the extent of the rather sad thought that her husband wouldn't miss her but the children might miss her. You'll recall that when 1 kept the Galvanic skin response on her fingers, it was impossible to have a base- reading, there was a lot of anxiety and • tension and there is no doubt that this is a highly strung woman. But the impression I have and certainly, watching her under hynosis, and listening to her, and the material that she then produced, was very fanciful. My feeling here is that we are barking up the wrong tree. I felt that this was just an hysteric with a very vivid fantasy. Deeply influenced by the film she saw. It's hard to know about the child Andre, whether he enters into this with her as a kind of \"folie a Deux,\" whether, they are playing a fantasy game and they see what they want to see and hear what they want to hear. This is certainly possible. But I must confess that I'm not very impressed by this particular recall of hers. Of course, I'm not denigrating Dr. Levinson's conclusions; nevertheless, as a UFO researcher of many years standing, I ,also cannot accept them. Let's look at some of the facts. If indeed, Andre was involved with Meagan in a dual fantasy, then surely he would have seen exactly the same things as she did. But when the man bent down at the other side of the craft, although Meagan was aware of this, she did not see them lift the sand from the ground in their hands and let it filter through their fingers. She was also aware that when the man bowed to her, he said something, but she did not know what it was, although it was a \"strange language, high-pitched and sing-song.\" Andre, on the other hand, heard the man very clearly and was able to tell me that the word he said, unrecognizable to him, was a three-syllable word. Meagan was aware of a \"bright pink glow\" about the craft, but did not know exactly where the light was emanating from. Andre told me immediately it had a bright pink light at the top and one on either side of the door. Meagan and I first arrived at the doctor's offices, she was very nervous and frightened of the hypnosis. No wonder her response on the Galvanic machine did not allow a base reading. I also feel a great deal of information was lost by the correct questions not being asked. Although I appreciate that leading questions would have given less credence to Meagan's story, I still feel that when she says \"it has a funny light on top....odd light,\" Dr. Levinson could have established in which way this was \"funny\" or \"odd.\" She says again \"He's got dark skin, but he's funnily dressed.\" Here again, he could have delved a little deeper into her rather nebulous descriptions. When she says, \"It looks a bit like an egg,\" he should have enlarged on this. There were many other features to the craft not even mentioned under regression. I would have asked why it was necessary to \"look into his eyes.\" Surely this was a command that needed a great deal of explanation? Meagan says, \"He's talking in English\" and then \"Why can't he talk in English?\" One assumes that he is addressing the rest of the men in their own language but this should have been established. Meagan's description of the interior of the craft was very meager. She saw chairs — what sort of chairs? Were they sitting-room chairs, lecture-room chairs, or what? The table in the centre of the room — what was this like? There were panels around the sides, there were \"funny lights\" — what were they really like? In analysis, the most significant portion of the tape was when the \"Commander\" asks Meagan to look into his. eyes and when he told her something they wanted her to forget. This was glossed over too quickly. Perhaps Meagan was not hypnotized deeply enough — perhaps this could have been induced? In his summing up, it was obvious that Dr. Levinson had read very little about regressive hypnosis in relation to UFO experiences. He found the recording strange and yet related it in normal, everyday terms; There is nothing normal about UFO close encounter experiences. He also mentions the film Meagan saw — Close Encounters of the Third. Kind. Did the psychiatrist see the film? If so, where were the egg-shaped craft, the dark skinned humanoids? One could pick out a great number of incidents, none of which even remotely resembles Meagan's descriptions. In conclusion, I cannot help but feel that Meagan's experience was real. She has a rather limited vocabulary and therefore her descriptions are hardly evocative. Nevertheless, with encouragement and patience and the co-operation of Dr. Levinson, I am quite sure we can get to the bottom of this fascinating experience."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"THE RALLY INCIDENT: A TELEPORTATION? By Guillermo C. Roncoroni (Director of Servicio de Investigaciones Ufologicas, Buenos Aires, Argentina) (The following article was published by S.I.U. - U.F.O. Press, Volume III, Number 9, October 1978, Page 32. TVans/af/on by William G. Hinrichsen, Continental Coordinator for South America. A brief newspaper account of the incident was reported in Journal No. 130, Sept. 1978.--Editor) The months of August, September, and October 1978, had been characterized by an unusual increase in UFO activity throughout the Argentine territory. During the month of August, this activity was especially preponderant in the western area (along the Andes), in the provinces of San Juan, Mendoza and Neuquen, with isolated manifestations in Chile, along the same geographic latitude. During the last week of August, and the first two weeks of September, the epicenter of the manifestations moved to the south of the province of Buenos Aires (Pedro Luro, Medanos, Bahia Blanca, Coronel Dorrego, and Necochea), which brought about the first CE-I cases for this period. Finally, beginning September 20th, a series of important sightings occurred in the province of Tucuman, and in Rosario, Melincue, and Casilda, in the province of Santa Fe.... Of all the UFO sightings during the August/October period, the incident \"Acevedo/Moya\" is, without a doubt, the most important, not only because of its wide coverage by the news media, but for its many unusual character- istics. The Incident On August 17, 1978, Carlos Acevedo and Hugo Prambs, left the city of Buenos Aires in a Citroen GS 1220, #102, on the first leg of the South American Rally, organized by the Argentina Automobile Club and the Regional Interchange Bank. The 8 competition in which they were participating was going to be extremely exhausting. A real test of endurance of , man as well as machines, extending well over a'month's rime, joining Buenos Aires with Caracas (Venezuela), and returning again through the Pacific Coast. The crew of car #102 suffered many problems, especially in the final legs of the rally, which caused them to abandon the competition. Because of Acevedo's determination, and other contestants' assistance, they were able to continue, after making official their quitting the competition, with the objective of completing all the legs of the rally. On September 16, in the city of Bariloche, Hugo Prambs left because of personal problems, being replaced by Miguel Angel Moya. In the early hours of September 23, Acevado and Moya were traveling the last 1,000 km. Approximately at 2:00 a.m., they stopped at a gas station in Viedma (province of Rio Negro) where they filled up the 50-liter tank, and a reserve one containing an additional 40 liters. After having some coffee and conversing with other contestants, they left at 2:30 a.m. heading for Bahia Blanca, after crossing the Rio Negro river, and passing through the city of Carmen de Patagones. Around 3:00 a.m., after going through the intersection of Route 3 and the road to Cardenal Cagliero, they were close to Salitral del Algarrobo and Salina de Piedra, about 30 km north of the city of Carmen de Patagones (approximately 40° 29' South Latitude, 62° 49' West Longitude). Carlos Acevedo was driving the Citroen. Suddenly he observed through the rear-view mirror a very bright light. It seemed to be very dense, and it's color was yellow. At first it was only a point in the distance, increasing in size as it got closer. Acevedo and Moya were traveling at that time at about 100 km per hour. In spite of this fact, the light seemed to be approaching at very high speed which made Acevedo think that they were the headlights of one of the high- performance cars participating in the rally (Citroen 2400 or Mercedes Benz). They decided to slow down and keep the car to the extreme right of the road, in order to facilitate the passing of what they supposed to be another contestant. The light was now occupying the entire rear-view mirror and continued approaching at high speed. Suddenly the interior of the Citroen was filled with light. \"The light flooded the interior completely, and I couldn't see any farther than the hood of the car. It was very dense and bright, and its color was yellowish with a violet tint. At that moment the car seemed to be out of control. I looked through the window and saw that we were about two meters off the ground. I immediately thought that we had hit something, flying into the air, and started getting ready for the moment when the car would hit the road again,\" said Acevedo. The car, instead of descending, seemed to continue its ascent out of control. \"After a few seconds, perhaps 5 or 10, I realized that all that was completely abnormal.

The witnesses discovered this fact when checking the odometer at their arrival at Pedro Luro (corroborated by Mr. Forchesatto). It is also worth mentioning that this lack of registering was not caused by a malfunction of the car's instruments, since the same distance was measured by additional precision instruments carried by the crews participating in this type of competition.

Acevedo stated that, after the incident, his legs no intention of competing with UFO groups; to the contrary, it expects to financially support research and educational projects by members of existing groups.

Wesley Gruman, 19, was driving north towards Oak Bluff, Mass., about eight o'clock when he noticed a green glow shining from behind the sand dunes between him and the shore. As he approached the glow, which he assumed at first was coming from \"light sticks\" on the beach, he noticed that his AM car radio picked up a low frequency hum. When he reached a point on the road where he had an unobstructed view of the shore, he saw that the glow emanated from a luminous yellow- green cylinder that was apparently floating in the water about 200 feet away. Stopping his car to examine it more closely, he observed that it was about 30 feet long, was rounded at both ends, and had no visible openings or protrusions. When he stopped, the object began slowly and silently to rise out of the water. As it emerged he could see that the action of the water was as through a boat or any other large physical object were being lifted. From the driver's-seat he watched it go up until the top of^the^window cut off his , and then he openfea'the\"caV<febr and stepped out on the road, leaving the lights on and the motor running.

All these facts contributed even more to the witnesses' confusion who, seized by increasing apprehension, decided to inform the Pedro Luro Police Department. There they met inspector Daniel Osimi, who was informed in detail of all the events, and was asked 'by the witnesses to provide them with an escort to the city of Bahia Blanca. Inspector Osimi, realizing the desperation, of the two men, commissioned Corporal J. Garcia to 'accompany the witnesses to Bahia Blanca, departing a few minutes later, and arriving at the destination around 8:30 a.m. The Witnesses ; Carlos Acevedo is 38 years old. His parents are from Chile, but he was born in Argentina. He has been living in Chile since 1960. In the capital, Santiago, he has two elegant shoe stores located in the most sophisticated part of town. He has two children from a previous marriage, and a 5-year-old child with his -/present wife Cecilia. Acevedo is in a very good financial situation (as evidenced by his participation in the rally for which he had to spend more :thah $20,000). He is an extrovert and :easy to get along with. Miguel Angel Moya is 28 years old. He was born and raised in Santiago, Chife. He is a mechanic (one of the best, according to Acevedo). He is kind.of shy and quiet. He seems to have been affected by the incident in.which he participated. Both witnesses give a very good impression. Their respective accounts of the incident are very coherent. They did not contradict each other, and responded to all questions without .hesitation. There are no reasons to doubt their testimony. Other Testimony Inspector Daniel Osimi: He stated that the witnesses, while in the Pedro Luro Police Dept., were in complete control of their mental faculties, although they still showed signs of nervousness caused by the incident. Osimi verified the absence of any breakage or leaks in the reserve gas tank; the disappearance of 40 liters of fuel has no explanation. Corporal J. Garcia: He noticed that the witnesses were very nervous. 10 They practically exchanged no words during the trip to Pedro Luro, Bahia Blanca. In one instance, Acevedo was visibly startled when a car, traveling behind them, turned oh his high beams. Hector Forchesatto (service station attendant): He was the first one to have any contact with the witnesses right after the incident. He also noticed how nervous they were, especially Moya. He remembered having heard them discuss the problem about the mileage and the disappearance of gasoline. In his opinion, the witnesses seemed sincerely concerned and their state of restlessness and confoundment was impossible to fake. Besides, Forchesatto assured us that, between 4:30 a.m. and 4:45 a.m., neighbors in the city of Ascasubi observed the fast displacement of a powerful yellowish light heading west (we haven't been able to confirm this statement). Comments As in many other UFO cases, we must base our investigation on the witnesses' report. There are no physical traces or other evidence that could corroborate our conclusions, therefore, the general reliability of the incident will depend, exclusively, in the trust that the witnesses deserve. In the opinion of all those who interviewed Acevedo and Moya (reporters, police, and myself), the witnesses deserve that trust. They have been willing to subject themselves .to an open and unconditional interrogatory without objections. Their statements have been coherent, ordinate, without con- tradictions, and I consider that the element of trust be placed at a high j level. The characteristics of the incidentl itself, its notorious oddity, deserve aj detailed analysis. The loss of time factor: Thos^ who had investigated the incident up to now had overlooked an element that, ill my opinion, requires closer attention the time factor. Acevedo and Me leave behind Carmen de Patagor approximately 2:50 a.m. minutes later, after covering bet 25 to 30 km, they see the yellowish \\i{ for the first time. Thus, between a.m. and 3:05 a.m., the ment events take place. Afterwards, th themselves on the embankment od opposite side of the road, on «fo u t e 3 and after a couple of minu£ es th e j continue the trip to Bahia Bl^^ At 5:10 they arrive at P^dro L uro (this fact corroborated by tf^ service station attendant, Mr. Fothesatto) which means that they cfyeref th^ distance between Ca men de Patagones/Pedro Luro in aiproximate^ T~ ly 2:20 hours. Supposing tHjt they.had- covered that distanQ without^ inconvenience, and travjjng a t an average speed of 100 knuh., it would= have taken 75 to 80 nhutes at most, leaving approximiely 60 minutes unaccounted for.

Negotiation is under way for the CAUS/Just Cause mailing list to be absorbed by MUFONrwith prorating of outstanding subscriptions to be filled by the MUFON Journal. Mr. Bryant emphasizes that the decision to cease publishing Just Cause is due to lack of broad public support, limited operating funds, and the inability of such a specialized organization as CAUS to reach a wide enough Audience for its message.

On September 19, 1979, in Room 12 of the courthouse building of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, the two sides met before Judge John H. Pratt to act on the defendant's recent motion for a summary judgment. After a full year of litigation, it's not surprising to hear a note or two of frustration emanating from all parties concerned — •On the part \"of the Central Intelligence Agency, represented by its own counsel and by a spokesman from the Justice Department, in its effort to play up the relatively unimportant assortment of UFO papers thus far released. •On the part of the judge, now in the winter of his career and visibly impatient with the litigants' wrangling over the minutiae of document-search dates/places/findings, in his Condonesque attempt to give UFOlogy a measure of respectability while at the same time bending over backwards to afford the Government relief from the interminable burden of justifying its role in UFO research. •On the part of the plaintiff, Ground Saucer Watch of Phoenix, Ariz., represented by New York attorney Peter A. Gersten, in its effort to show that the released CIA documents constitute not merely the tip of a paper iceberg but also confirmation that past UFO policy/practices of the Agency are alive and well at CIA headquarters in Langley, Va. — viz., deception, circumlocution^ of the- issues, subterfuge, and stonewalling. , Where will it all end? And when? Well, after some questioning of both sides by the judge (in which he characterized Gersten as a \"vigorous advocate\" whose choice of language in referring to the \"lies\" of the defendant was too strong \"down here\" in Washington, D.C.), the judge agreed to allow the plaintiff 60 days in which to provide a written response to the CIA motion for summary judgment. Maybe by Christmas, as the expression goes, we'll leam just how far the plaintiff has prevailed in this case — and just how- long the Agency will be able to retain its web of secrecy around a body of UFO data that has yet to see the light of public exposure. KENTUCKY UFO CHASE By Mildred Biesele (Investigated by George Baker) When George Baker, a MUFON Research Specialist who lives in Crawfordsville, Indiana, read in the Richmond, Kentucky, Register that a car had been chased down a local rural (Kentucky Chase, Continued) road by a flashing UFO, he and his wife drove the 300 miles to Richmond to investigate. At the Richmond police station they were directed to the home of the widow Asie Legar, about 15 miles from town on Log Cabin Road, the scene of the chase. After some difficulty getting through the gate, up the driveway and past the dogs, they arrived to find Mrs. Legar to be a reluctant witness. However, she overcame her hesitation to confide in strangers and told the following story. She said that her daughter Lise Legar, her son Phillip Wayne, and her brother Leo Vanlinkey came home about 9:30 on the night of November 29 \"scared to death.\" When their car drove up to the house all three jumped out onto the porch, leaving the lights on and the engine running, they had been followed, they explained, for about a mile by something that was shining a blue-white light down on them. At one time it shot a \"sort of flame\" out of the front; they thought that was when the car stalled and the lights went off. Asie said that standing on the porch they watched the thing circle the house and the surrounding fields several times, climbing and diving, swooping, she estimated, from about 100 to about 300 feet above the ground. It appeared to be cigar shaped and about the size of the Goodyear blimp,, which she had once seen. It had a dull red glow except for the time on Log Cabin Road when it flew low over the car, then it brightened to white. Finally it began to fade as it sped away over the mountain to.the north. The family called the state police, but by the time a patrol car arrived there was nothing for the officers to see except four very frightened people. At the state police post in Richmond, the Bakers were permitted to examine the log for November 29. In addition to the notation concerning the Legar incident, it recorded calls from other excited citizens who reported seeing lights in the sky. The log suggests that \"a meteorite must have exploded over the entire area\"; however, the log also adds that no evidence has been found to support that contention. 13"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"By Ann Druffei UFO SIGHTINGS BY UFO RESEARCHERS: THE \"INACCESSIBLE CASES\" — Part II For many years I have tried to find conventional explanations for the bright, yellowish daytime object which I saw traverse 15-20 degrees of sky in about an hour and a half in late June or July 1945. The idea that it might have been a Japanese balloon occurred to me a .few years ago. It is now a known fact that the Japanese released a number of large balloons from the Pacific theater of war ^and some traveled in high windstreams toward the American continent, landing as far\" east as some midwest states. Could the 1945 object seen from Long Beach, California, by my mother and myself have been a Japanese balloon? It seems highly unlikely, for the winds which carried these propaganda devices traveled from west to east. The 1945 object traveled generally from east to west. If the object was in a true orbital position high above earth's atmosphere, its angular speed would match nicely with this, provided that it had a means of propulsion and could regulate its own flight. It was not in free orbital flight, for satellites (nonpolar) travel in westerly to easterly directions. However, the object seemed to behave as though it were stationary above the earth, with an apparent angular speed caused by the rotation of the earth. It traveled 15-20 degrees\" in somewhat more than an hour, and the stars, sun, etc. appear to move at about 15 degrees an hour, likewise from east to west. Was the object, then, stationary above the earth? Carrier craft UFOs are almost always observed to be stationary when releasing, or receiving back, their satellite discs. At 5:30 a.m. on a cloudy dawn, on July 16, 1945, the first experimental bomb was exploded on the desert near Alamagordo, New Mexico. Had my sighting occurred on or immediately 14 after this date? Had a huge, extraterrestrial craft been drawn to the scene to investigate this sign that the inhabitants of Earth had entered into the atomic age? Had it slowly moved from east to west, deciding to launch scout ships before sunset to explore below? The general path of the object was from the direction of Alamagordo, New Mexico, toward Long Beach, California, but of course the altitude at which it hovered is unknown, so precise calculations cannot be made at this time. The accompa'nying map shows the relationship of the atomic testing ground to Long Beach. The direction of the object's movement and the relationship between the two earth locations tally fairly well. In an attempt to recover the exact date of my 1945 sighting, W.C. McCall, M.D. used hypnotic regression techniques on June 15, 1977. Dr. McCall is a Southern California researcher with 20 years experience in clinical hypnosis. Also present at the session were other Southland researchers, Dr. Alvin Lawson and John de Herrera. The session in some ways was successful, but less satisfactory in other aspects. I relived the awe and fear of seeing the inexplicable light and its \"pieces\" which traveled out and away'from it. The general time span was confirmed. It was summer of 1945, but the exact date was not retrievable; it seemed that it was near the end of the month of either June or July. However, in view of my conscious memory that the Hiroshima bomb fell shortly after the sighting, it seemed logical to assume that the sighting was made during the last half of July. The date of the Hiroshima bombing was August 6, 1945. Sample descriptions from the session's transcript point up the awe felt while viewing the object: 1 \"I think it's too high for a balloon.-...I've never seen anything like it. It's not what a balloon would look like. Just, just weird. It just—moves so slowly. It doesn't do anything it should. It shouldn't ibe up there....It's not supposed to be up there....I'm watching a long time/, It moves toward the northwest, real high....\" McCall then used an hypnotic technique which is employed occasionally iri clinical situations where information is not easily obtainable by the subject because he is not in appropriate proximity to an event and therefore cannot make an adequate value-judgment about it.

However, considering the scientific validity of remote-viewing, as proven at Stanford Research Institute by the experiments of Puthoff and Targ, 2 we might be permitted to speculate here that the hypnotic technique described above was a remote-viewing experience of a sort and perhaps yielded reliable information. Puthoff and Targ demonstrated that ordinary persons with no particular psychic abilities can produce reliable precognitive information as well as clairvoyant information in the current time-frame. Why, then, could not \"remote viewing\" — which seems enchanced in the hypnotic state 3 — produce reliable information when applied to incidents in the past? Dr. McCall has obligingly tried the identical technique in other UFO cases in which hypnotic regression has been used. In the case of Emily Gronin, 4 she and a friend, Jan Whitley, experienced . paralysis and amnesia during an incident involving a bright light of unknown source which approached their car as they were sleeping in a rest- stop on a heavily-traveled mountain road in Northern California. They had pulled off to allow the thick nighttime truck traffic to clear before proceeding on their own journey home. Neither woman could remember any specific details of what might have produced their paralysis and time-lapse. In regressing Emily Cronin, Dr. McCall used the same hypnotic suggestions as described above. MC: \"....Now what I'd like to have you do is detach your mind from your body so you can kind of float around over the top of the car. Let your mind float around, just kind of watch what happens. I want you to tell me every detail, everything that happens while you're sleeping in the car....\" EC: \"....I'm so high....I can't see....oh! that's beautiful (referring to truck lights winding around the mountain).... 5 \" MC: \"Let's go down a little closer now to the car where your body's parked....\" EC: \"....the top of the car.,..and there's light around it and we're asleep....behind it....the light came in the back window....people, a couple of people....dark....Tall! There were two of them here (near the light source).... and there was another one back there (looking in the back window of her car)....He doesn't know who I am. He's fascinated. He doesn't know what that little person is (referring to Emily's 6- year-old son asleep on the back seat)....He doesn't know why that's such a little person....the other two are coming toward him. He's looking in the side window....They, want to leave. They want him to gp. He doesn't want to go, but they say they have to go. It's like, it's like a mistake*. That's what they said....dark clothes on, and he's dark....their faces are elongated, or very long. They're kind of flat, but they're elongated.\" Here again we have the question — is the information which surfaced real or imaginary? There is a strong probability Emily Cronin's mind was manufacturing detail in response to the hypnotist's request. But there is also a possibility that she was remote-viewing accurate facts! One factor in this case which leads me to wonder whether Emily was, in fact, retrieving realistic details lies in the following: Three years earlier, in 1953, Jan Whitley and another young woman, Sara Shaw, had an apparent abduction experience in Tujunga, California, but the event was almost totally blocked out by amnesia. In hypnotic regression sessions in 1975, Sara described the UFO entities almost precisely as Emily described the creatures near her car. Yet Sara's information was carefully guarded from Jan, who was never successfully regressed, either for the 1953 or the later 1956 experience with Emily. Emily likewise did not know how Sara described her abductors. Other subtle, but logical, correlations were found between the two encounters. It is for this reason that I feel that Emily's information obtained during her \"mind travel\" or remote-viewing was valid. Likewise, the \"close-up view\" I obtained of the object hovering over Long Beach in 1945 might possibly be valid. Note the description of the \"door\" in the bottom of the object, which is verbalized as a \"bomb bay.\" It LINES RESEMBLING ''' ..  „., • BOMB-BAY DOOR  ' '•••\"•'•>' _-. , BOTTOM VIEW rigure 1 was described in terms familiar' to a witness during World War II. Also, the fuzziness oh the edges of the object was not only a visual impression. It gave me a sensory impression during hypnosis as well, which is not described in the transcript. It was as if I could not approach closer, due to some sort of force — the same force which seemed to produce the \"fuzzy\" edges. I present the facts and speculation above for one reason only — it may be worthwhile for other UFO researchers. to come forward and present their own UFO experiences. We must not be fearful of ridicule. With a phenomenon as weird and elusive as UFOs, our minds must be inventive and open to any technique which holds any promise at all of yielding usable information. NOTES 1.

Schuessler UFO investigators and reseachers are continually searching for new tools that may be applied to the never-ending quest for truth. The police polygraph machine has been used in a number of incidents and with some small measure of success. Perhaps, one of the best known and most controversial polygraph cases is the Travis Walton incident. The use of that particular tool demonstrated a very real need for additional tools. Supplementing the polygraph in a number of abduction cases is the use of regressive hypnosis. Drs. Sprinkle and Harder have done much to demonstrate the usefulness of hypnosis. Even so, the question still remains — \"Is the witness telling the truth?\" A more accurate, but costly, technique is the Psychological Stress Evaluator (PSE). The NATIONAL ENQUIRER makes extensive use of this tool, and with excellent results. Because of the cost, however, few investigators can afford to apply the PSE in their work. What is needed is a low-cost....portable unit suitable for screening UFO incidents. Then, only those cases showing high credibility would need to be subjected to the more costly techniques. Several commercial firms — Hogarth Corp., Dektor, Law Enforcement Associates, and Communication Control Systems — have been very active in refining the old police polygraph machine to make it available to a wider market. Hogarth has a mock-up of a stress monitor, or lie detector, small enough to fit in a fountain pen. Communication Control Systems is working on a unit to fit in a wrist watch. Psycho-Science, Inc., of Mobile, Alabama, has marketed a lie detector as small as a transistor radio, selling for around .$250. Their unit, the SA-X, measures stress through voice analysis. It electronically picks up voice micro- tremors which are otherwise inaudible and determines if stress is present. It has no printouts, but depends upon flashing green, yellow, and red lights. The $29.95 units are still sometime in the future, not now. In the meantime we must make the most of the existing tools. HILL RADAR-UFO CONNECTION WEAK In the July MUFON UFO Journal (No. 137) some comments about a radar sighting apparently coinciding with the famous 1961 Hill abduction case in New Hampshire were excerpted from a longer article by Patricia McMahon. Ms. McMahon reported that the Project Blue Book files contained a reference to the radar sighting, but not the full report. David Webb has since informed the Journal that in 1970 Betty Hill obtained copies of the Air Force intelligence reports on the radar incident and made copies available to the Massachusetts investigators. Dave forwarded copies of these, plus internal investigation reports by Walter Webb (May 29, 1972) and John Oswald (January 1976) indicating that the radar track and Hill incident, despite the coincidence in time, probably were unrelated. The Journal was unaware of 16 By Richard Hall these reports and regrets perpetuating the story that the UFO in the Hill case may have been tracked on radar. No evidence for this has been found. The Air Force report, dated 20 September 1961, reads as follows: 0614 (Z?) OBSERVED UNIDENTIFIED A/C COME ON PAR (PRECISION APPROACH RADAR AT PEASE AFB--ED.) 4 MILES OUT. A/C MADE APPROACH AND PULLED UP AT % MILE. SHORTLY AFTER OBSERVED WEAK TARGET ON DOWNWIND, THEN RADAR CTC (CONTACT-ED.) LOST. TWR (TOWER-- ED.) WAS ADVISED OF THE A/C WHEN IT WAS ON FINAL, THEN WHEN IT MADE LOW APPROACH. TWR UNABLE TO SEE ANY A/C AT ANY TIME. Oswald's report illustrates the runways and approach patterns at the Air Force base. The report indicates that some unidentified \"aircraft\" (possibly a UFO, but doing nothing extraordinary) was detected by radar in the Pease AFB landing pattern. However, this was at low level some 80 miles away from the \"abduction\" site and is not even a strong radar case, so that any link with the Hill incident is purely conjectural. Assertions by Betty Hill that several radar sets tracked a UFO and that Air Force pilots chased it are based purely on her memory of verbal statements by acquaintances, and no documentation exists in support of them. The radar sighting at Pease AFB is not even clearly a UFO nor is it clearly connected with the Hill incident, and no other documentation is known at the present time.

'  (MUFON Representative for England) On Sunday, August 26, and Monday, August 27, 1979, the first international UFO congress ever to be held in Britain was staged at Grand Metropolitan's sumptuous Mount Royal Hotel in London. The organizers were the British Unidentified Flying Objects ^Research Association (BUFORA), their principal collabo- rators being Contact International (UK). The congress was a resounding success, with ufologists arriving from many parts of the world, and filling the large auditorium to capacity (standing room only for most of the time). This report records the aims of the congress, its activities, and what it appears to have-achieved. Essentially, the aims of this event were twofold. Firstly, it endeavored to provide an opportunity for the many active ufologists scattered throughout Europe to meet not only each other but respected colleagues from further afield. In this it was enormously successful. Secondly, the congress acted as a forum for the interchange of opinions relating to the formulation of an internationally agreed code of field investigation, case classification, and data storage/retrieval system. In this, the congress was partially successful. Among the most prominent delegates and speakers were Dr. J. Allen Hynek, Dr. Leo Sprinkle (both of the U.S.A.); Mr. David Haisell (Canada); Prof. Antonio • Ribeira and Vincente-Juan Ballester Olmos (both of Spain); Dr. Erol Faruk (UK); Dr. Roberto Pinotti, Edoardo Russo, and Francesco Izzo (all of Italy); Per Anderson (Denmark); Knut Aashein (Norway); Bertil Kuhlemann (Sweden); Rudy de Groote, (Belgium); Douwe Bosga (Netherlands); Alain Esterle (France); Anthony Pace, Peter Hill, Lionel Beer, Timothy O'Brien, Lawrence Dale, and Robert Digby (all of BUFORA); that doyen of British ufology Graham Knewstub; and myself (Contact International (UK) and MUFON's representative in the UK). Other noteworthy individuals included Dr. Andreas Achillides (Cyprus), B. Biffier (Switzerland), Dr. Mahmoud Prasad' (India), Ananda Sirisena (SrlLanka), Philippe Scheyder (France); Paolo di Girolarho (Italy), Edna Smith (Republic of South Africa), Derek Mansell (Contact UK), Edgar Hatvany and Charles Lockwood (BUFORA), Jenny Randies (NUFON), and John Rimmer (MUFOB). Many other delegates attended too numerous to name here. It was a truly international gathering. The congress opened on Sunday at 9:30 a.m., when a goodly number of delegates had already arrived and who inspected a large bookstall displaying a comprehensive range of UFO literature and an extensive exhibition which concentrated upon investigative methodology and the results of recent research. A series of new full-color world maps of UFO landings and occupant sightings were exhibited for the first time anywhere and excited considerable interest. These had been prepared by the Data Research unit of Contact International (UK) at Oxford. A copy of the MUFON investigators' handbook, which is also used by Contact International (UK) field investigators, was also in evidence. The formal opening of the congress took place at 11:25 a.m., and was undertaken most effectively by Timothy O'Brien, BUFORA's President. Thereafter the program ran as follows: 11:45 a.m. Lawrence Dale, FRAS.-- . \"Current BUFORA Investigations.\" 12:30 p.m. Break for lunch (many valuable informal meetings and conversations occurr- ed during this period, and at subsequent breaks for refreshments). 14:10 p.m. Dr. Leo Sprinkle--\"Models of UFO Evidence:\" ' 15:10 p.m. Peter - Hill, AMR, FMS, FSS. - \"From Data to Information.\" 15:50 p.m. Break for tea. 16.20 p.m. Edoardo Russo - \"The - Italian UFO Wave of 1978.\" 17.20 p.m. Roberto Pinotti--\"Moreon the Italian UFO Wave of 1978.\" 17:40 p.m. Graham Knewstub -- \"UFOs\". 18:15 p.m. Close of afternoon session. 19:00 p.m. Special Congress Dinner. 21:00 p.m. Documentary film \"UFOs, Past, Present, and Future.\" On Monday, the program followe'd the format described below. 09:30 a.m. Visit to the ' London Planetarium. 10:45 a.m. Break for coffee: 11:15 a.m. J.

From the foregoing it can be seen that a wide range of ufological matters came .under the congress's scrutiny. The \"working party,\" just alluded to, functioned for most of the entire congress in a separate room, participating delegates coming and going as papers and other matters of interest to them occurred in the auditorium. The \"working-party\" was chaired by Peter Hill. Few definite results could be reported as a mere 2 days, or parts thereof, proved to be •quite insufficient to agree on acceptable solutions to the matters listed on its agenda. However, much preliminary progress was made, and all those present concurred that subsequent \"working parties\" (of which more will be arranged in the future) should be able to operate effectively and more speedily now that so many initial items had been discussed. MUFON will be represented (via-this writer) at future \"working- parties,\" the dates and venues of which will be announced in due course. Almost without exception all delegates felt that the congress was very worthwhile, and expressed the hope that another would be staged without delay. It is to be hoped that, on the basis of the obvious success of the present congress, that even more ufological colleagues from abroad will attend future UFO gatherings of this sort in London.

All current indications are that the photograph is valid. The September 4 issue reports a recent poll conducted by INDUSTRIAL RESEARCH/ DEVELOPMENT magazine, indicating that 61% of the scientists questioned were of the opinion that UFOs \"probably\" exist. A highly suspect story of UFOs being involved in the Apollo 11 lunar landing is presented in the September 11 issue. While there may well have been astronaut/UFO encounters which have not been made public, this particular article smacks of .the totally fictional \"transcripts\" of astronauts' conversations from the Moon which received so much undeserved publicity a few years ago. Another article in this issue suggests that the descriptions of Venus, based on information from U.S. and Soviet space probes, are virtually identical to the Biblical picture of Hell. Dr. Irwin Ginsburgh, author of FIRST, MAN. THEN, ADAM!, suggests that ancient space visitors gave a description of Venus to primitive Earthman, accounting for the \"fire and brimstone\" stories of Hell. The September 18 issue tells of an abduction case which allegedly occurred near Tyler, Texas, on January 24,1979, and which is being investigated by the Houston-based \"Project Visit\" research group. THE STAR for August 28 repeats some of the UFO reports and rumors from the Soviet Union, including one scientist's opinion that UFOs are really bands of \"cold radiation\" in the atmosphere. The September 18 issue reports on the recent Minnesota incident in which a deputy sheriff was injured and his patrol car damaged by a UFO. James Oberg's \"UFO Update\" column in the September issue of OMNI is largely devoted to the Bill Pecha sighting near Colusa, California, in 1976. Oberg concludes that \"there was a UFO over Colusa County that night,\" but \"the dispute still rages over what, if anything, it proved.\" Shirley Hoffman's article in the October issue of FATE tells of a 1978 case from near Union, Missouri, in which a car was allegedly lifted partially off the road- by a low-flying UFO. Physical evidence, in the form of indentations, was found on the car's trunk. The November issue of UFO REPORT contains articles by Stanton T. Friedman, John Charles Seely, Jim Miles, William L. Moore, James Oberg, and others. The contributions by Seely and Moore are of particular interest, as is Friedman's exposition of his views on the UFO phenomenon. The #5 issue of UFO UPDATE, while containing a few items of interest, is largely rehash of familiar material. More warmed-over material is served up in the #15 issue of TRUE UFOs & OUTER SPACE, including reprints from older issues of TRUE. The #8 issue of IDEAL'S UFO MAGAZINE, with its usual mixture of fiction and rehash, is now on the stands. Enough said!

Venus — Venus, which was unfavorably placed in the morning sky until August, is now unfavorably placed in the evening sky. Although technically an evening \"star\", 10 to 18 degrees east of the sun, it is too close to the horizon to be seen.

Since all of us are volunteers, we invite present members who are now serving as Field Investigators, Research Specialists, or Field Investigator Trainees to upgrade their status based upon their education, training, and experience by writing to your International Director signifying your desires. This is especially applicable in states such as Nevada, Utah, Washington, Idaho, Wyoming, North and South Dakota, Vermont, Rhode Island, Puerto Rico, Alaska, and Hawaii where our coverage is not adequate. We also invite Journal subscribers to take a more active role, if they are so inclined, and become a part of the solution to the UFO phenomenon by expanding their knowledge as Field Investigators or Field Investigator Trainees. Two definite steps have been taken at the recommendations of the former State Directors to bolster the leadership by the following appoint- ments. Robert E. Engberg, formerly a State Section Director, has been elevated to the position of State Director for Minnesota. A Professional Engineer, Bob may be contacted at P.O. Box 80143, St. Paul, MN 55108 or by telephone at (612) 646-7331. Gerald K. Ginnings, Ph.D., formerly State Director for Tennessee, has suggested that someone from the Oak Ridge (ORION) group become the State Director since ORION personnel have become the hub of activity in their state. David K. Hackett, M.S. has volunteered to serve as State Director for Tennessee. David is currently the Director of ORION and is employed at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory. Dave and his wife Nancy reside at 6500 Trousdale Road, Knoxville, TN 37921 and may be contacted by telephone at (615) 584-6547. Dave and Nancy attended the 1978 MUFON UFO Symposium in Dayton, Ohio, where we had the privilege of meeting them personally. Dr. Ginning's relationship with MUFON goes back to 1973 when he attended our symposium in Kansas City, Mo. Nancy is a Research Specialist in Psychology to MUFON. An example of an individual who accepted our invitation to take a leadership role in MUFON is Don Mason, who is the new State Section Director in Idaho for Ada, Gem, Payette, Canyon, Boise, and Elmore counties. Don resides at 113 East 45th Space 8 in Boise, ID 83704 and telephone (208) 376-4374. The Second Edition of the MUFON \"Field Investigator's Manual,\" edited by Raymond E. Fowler, Director of Investigations, was published in June 1975. Planning is now underway to publish the third edition by June of 1980, since we only have 300 copies of the second edition available for distribution. Considering the rapid strides being made in the scientific investigation of the UFO phenomenon, a revised and updated edition is urgently needed so the very latest techniques may be utilized. As Director of Investigations, Ray will edit the third edition with MUFON Consultants, Researchers, and Investigators adding their particular fields of expertise to individual specialized chapters as in the past. The following gentlemen have been invited to prepare either entirely new chapters or update their current subject based upon the state-of-the-art: Dr. Bruce Maccabee - Photographic Evidence; Dr. Richard F. .Haines - Visual Identification and Recognition; Ted Phillips - Investigations of Alleged UFO Landing Sites; Wayne Laporte - Chart on object sizes; Ted Bloecher and David Webb - Investigation of Entity Cases; Ron Westrum and Bob Stinson - Reliability Assessment of Evewitness Testimony; and J. Allen Hynek, Ph. D. - Interface with the Center for UFO Studies. An entirely new chapter will be prepared by Walt Andrus concerning the duties and responsibilities of each of the membership categories in the Mutual UFO Network. In addition to Ray Fowler's instructions in the preparation of the nine MUFON UFO Sighting Report Forms, we have asked Richard H. Hall, Editor of the MUFON UFO Journal, to write a section dwelling upon the narrative style of reporting suitable for publication in the Journal. Since we still have a good supply of the nine specialized UFO sighting report forms, they will continue to be used for at least another 5 years. Ray Fowler and his colleagues in Massachusetts did such an exceptionally fine job on the report forms, there is no need to revise them. At this time Ray Fowler and Walt Andrus invite contributions not only from our Consultants, but also from all MUFON members for specialized material that should be considered a part of the Field Investigator's Manual. A color chart that is commercially available in an 8% x 11 inch format is a necessity. Other suggested areas dealing directly with the specialized reporting forms are Electrical/Mag- netic, Animal Effects, Radar, Psycho- togical/Physiological, and Landing/ Traces/Artifacts are vitally needed from people qualified in these fields. It is conceivable that Leonard H. Stringfield may be able to add considerable information to the entity chapter in co- operation with Ted Bloecher. No deadlines for material to be submitted have been established, since this is the first membership notification for papers. We need basic scientific guidelines for UFO investigations for the manual, not theoretical or (continued on page 18)"}]
