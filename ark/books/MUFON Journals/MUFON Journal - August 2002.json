Betty Hill, now past 80 years of age, seemed as fiesty as ever as she recounted her experiences, showed slides, and answered questions. Representing international ufologists were Timothy Good of the UK, Esen Sekerkara of Turkey, Don Ledger of Canada, and Chris Styles of Canada. Hosting the symposium were New York State Director James Bouck, Jr., New York Assistant State Director Robert Long, and their New York MUFON team. This year's theme is \"Unity in Ufology/Connccting with the Scientific Community.\" Chris Styles: UFOs and Reality Transformation Chris Styles, a Canadian UFO researcher, is perhaps best known for his work on the 1967 Shag Harbour, Nova Scotia, inci- dent. He is the co-author with Don Ledger of a book about the case, Dark Object. A grant from the Fund for UFO Research (FUFOR), assisted his research. •••ajp.. ,.. Styles' presentation looked at the BKC^tSJBff ,| way events, such as being part of a multiple-witness UFO sighting, can transform a person's reality in some way. He said there are two types Chris Styles of Reality Transformation (RT): consistent (RT1) or in- consistent (RT2). Styles demonstrated how Reality Trans- formation works by looking at witnesses to two UFO cases: The Smith Encounter of Nov. 25, 1970 (RT1), and The Webster Sighting of Oct. 16-27, 1976 (RT2). William Birnes: The Day After Corso William Birnes, who assisted Col. Philip Corso with The Day After Roswell, is also an author of true-crime books, publisher of UFO Maga- zine, and editor-in-chief of UFO Encyclopedia. Birnes provided background in- formation on Col. Corso, including his military experiences, his state- ments regarding the investigation of the JFK assassination, and the technology which Col. Corso claimed he developed from a crashed UFO at Roswell, NM. Birnes indicated that there were some errors in Col. Corso's book, caused by the rush to get it written and printed in time for the 50 th anniversary of the reported crash at Roswell. August 2002 William Birnes He said that Col. Corso wanted to correct those errors for later printings of the book, but-that his deteriorating health prevented this. Birnes discussed the disagreements between Col. Corso and the motion picture company which had licensed his life story rights, and noted other aspects of the contro- versies surrounding Col. Corso, including a statement that UFOs are time machines, that Col. Corso saw a strange alien in a New Mexico cave, and that in the 1950's he had touched a metallic UFO in the desert. Col. Corso wanted to write another book, according to Birnes, entitled The Day After Dallas, which would re- count his experiences as Sen. Richard Russell's chief in- vestigator. This book, said Birnes, \"drew a straight line connecting the murders of JFK, Bobby Kennedy, the Rev- erend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., and Iran/Contra.\" Birnes concluded that \"Critics and detractors may quibble over the details, but the Philip Corso vision of what happened at Roswell and the impact that alien cultures might have had on our own, even from the dawn of hu- man history, might some day be as substantiated with fact as the colonel's statement that President Lyndon Johnson knew for a fact that the assassination of his predecessor in office was not the act of a crazed lone gunman, but an out-and-out conspiracy that his own Warren commission was established to cover up.\" . Jeff Sainio: Scientific Connections in Photo/Video Ufology Jeff Sainio, MUFON Staff Photoanalyst for still pho- tos and videotapes, is recognized throughout the world for his work with UFO photographs and videos. Sainio covered the principles of scientific analysis of photos and videotapes, showing nu- merous illustrations of apparently le- gitimate UFO photos and videos, as well as examples of fakes. He noted some of the difficulties he of- ten faces in trying to determine if the photos or videos are legitimate, such as no reference points, poor im- age quality, lack of information con- cerning the camera and setting, and single-witness events. He discussed in detail what char- acteristics of the photos could be tested, as well as what theories could be tested. He noted that \"pseudoscientists... abuse science\" by (1) failing to per- form control measurements, (2) failure to perform any measurements or experiments at all, (3) leaping tall build- ings to conclusions, (4) using science that they are insuf- ficiently trained in, combined with a failure to verify their conclusions with somebody who is, (5) misusing of the . . aimo MUFON UFO Journal Page 3"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"reducto ad absurdum method of logic, (6) lumping inde- pendent cases together, (7) uttering nonlogic, such as use of emotion rather than logic, and (8) in the field of video/ photoanalysis, using inappropriate.\"enhancements\" or blowups, as often done on TV shows. In analyzing photos scientifically, where there is enough information to do so, Sainio says the following steps are involved: (1) Observe the UFO video/photo in a measur- able, usually numeric, way; (2) Observe conventional ob- jects in the same manner, if possible; (3) Compare the UFO measurements with the conventional measurements; (4) If the UFO's characteristics are conventional or im- possible, there is probably a conventional explanation; (5) If the characteristics are unconventional, are they better explained by a \"fact\" or a \"faked\" explanation? (6) If any- thing interesting is learned, make the results public (sub- ject to witness privacy) and with months or years for other cases to corroborate or contradict. Sainio noted that \"some non-optical, not-precisely-sci- entific guidelines are useful: (1) The higher the number of witnesses, the lower the chance the case is a fraud; (2) Humans are imperfect witnesses, but the camera or camcorder has its own imperfections; (3) Photos are easy to fake, but videos are hard to fake. Richard Dolan: The Limits of Science in UFO Research Richard Dolan is the author of UFOs and the National Security* State, which covers the period from 1941 to 1973, and provides a thorough historical analysis of the national security dimensions of the UFO phenomenon. Dolan, who first got involved with the UFO phe- nomenon in 1994, assembled more than 300 documented military en- counters with UFOs, as well as the activities of more than fifty Air Force, Navy, and Army bases involving UFOs. In his talk, Dolan questioned both the meaning and value of unity in UFO research, as well as the desire for ufology to be more scientific. He reviewed the national security as- pects of UFOs, which he sees as \"a problem of intelligence, or counter-intelligence.\" He noted that \"beyond any question\" the military takes UFOs very seriously. Dolan suggested that there is 'probably a great deal of scientific research being done, but \"it's probably classified.\" He said he does not think current disclosure efforts will succeed, and points to the lack of success of Dr. Steven Greer, who launched a disclosure project a year ago. Dolan said, \"I do have a certain fear about calls for unity, and calls for connecting with the scientific commu- nity. I fear that moving in such a direction could well make our field excessively conservative. There is already a tendency among some UFO researchers to overcom- pensate because of the 'far out' nature of our topic.\" He Richard Dolan added, \"When we deal with UFOs, I have become con- vinced that the reality is far more radical than we-are.\" He notes that \"most well established fields lack unity of some sort. Would you want the field of modern history to have 'unity,' with everyone interpreting events the same way?\" In looking at the scientific study of UFOs, Dolan noted that \"this isn't something that you can replicate in a labo- ratory under controlled conditions. We have a real phe- nomenon that evades study.\" He says, however, that \"this is not to disparage the importance of being scien- tific in analyzing UFOs. Quite the contrary, we must be as scientific and objective as we can be.\" But looking to universities for answers is fruitless, he said. \"For all intents and purposes, UFO research is forbidden in academia.. ..It is well known how academia works: it's an intellectual bureaucracy, and an established hierarchy.. ..No one is qualified-orwilling-to sponsor new research in the field. Therefore nothing gets done in that world. As a result, the professional academic world breeds a cycle of ignorance about UFOs.\" Dolan also questioned the value of \"peer review,\" which he says has had \"more to do with enforcing social control than with maintaining intellectual standards.. ..In my field of history, I am all too familiar with examples of conservative-dominated elites stifling discourse within the ranks.\"    • In discussing the limits of science, Dolan noted that the famous Condon Committee Report was supposed to be a scientific analysis of UFOs—a detached, objective, analytic study. \"There are some good individual analy- ses, quite a few conclusions that do not match the data, a lot of good cases that should have been analyzed and weren't; many cases that were poor bets to begin with, as far as obtaining useful scientific data, and of course you find a director of the project who knew nothing about the topic, didn't want to know anything about it, could never take it seriously, and who was bent from the be- ginning on a negative conclusion. And yet the Condon Committee Report was reviewed by the American Acad- emy of Sciences and approved.\" In looking at what the UFOs and entities might repre- sent, Dolan says he has reached the tentative conclusion that they may represent artificial intelligence—advanced machine intelligence, vastly outstripping our own biologi- cal intelligence. He concludes, \"There seem to be two futures available to us. Either a modification of human biology, which would then be merged with advanced machine intelligence, or more simply, machine intelligence becomes so dominant as to be incomprehensible to us... .Could it be that such a progression is a normal one, not just here on Earth, but elsewhere in the universe where intelligent life may have evolved?\" Bill Hamilton: In Search of EBEs- ^;3 • :; : - Astrobiology, SETI, and Ufology William F. Hamilton III, the author of numerous ar- ticles and several books, is Executive Director of Page 4 MUFON UFO Journal August 2002"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Bill Hamilton Skywatch International. He has served MUFON in sev- eral positions, and presented a paper at the 1980 MUFON International UFO Symposium in Houston on the electrogravity theory of spacecraft propulsion. Hamilton explained how new findings in planetary sci- ence, as well as new findings and theories in biology, have a bearing on UFO studies, and suggested that a convergence of knowledge is indi- cated by all of these studies. He discussed the approach of SET! (Search for Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence) and described some of their activities, noting that SETI does not collaborate with scientists and re- searchers engaged in UFO studies. Hamilton pointed out how astrobi- ology-the study of the origin, evolu- tion, and distribution of life in the universe-is becoming more and more important in UFO studies, and described intriguing information provided by recent NASA probes, as well as discoveries made possible by more powerful telescopes. He also noted that laboratory experiments have resulted in the creation of \"some of the chemicals essential for life in an environment similar to that found in deep space.\" Hamilton also dealt with the question of whether space travel is possible, and the role that time dilation might play, as well as other theories of non-conventional space travel, such as reactionless drives, reduced gravitation, direct gravitational gradientSj indirect gravitational gradients, and wormholes. He concludes, \"The supporting evidence for extrater- restrial life is growing stronger with each new scientific discovery and each unexplained UFO incursion. The in- tertwining of information should be taken advantage of, and some group formed with the task of liaison for analy- sis of evidence.\" Timothy Good: Conflicting Interests in the Con- trol of Extraterrestrial Intelligence Timothy Good, who lives in the UK, is the author of several books on UFOs, the latest being Unearthly Disclosure (2000). A professional violinist, he played for 14 years with the London Symphony Orchestra. He first became interested in ufology in 1955, and has made numerous key contacts throughout the world over the past four decades. Good noted that Earth has at- tracted \"several alien species,\" and that \"some are here for purposes of exploitation, such as hybridization, leading to a conflict of interests at both a terrestrial and extraterrestrial level.\" He discussed the COMETA report (UFOs and Defense: Timothy Good What Must We Be Prepared For?), compiled by former high-ranking auditors at the French Institute of Higher Studies for National Defence (IHEDN), \"which con- cluded that the physical reality of UFOs, under the con- trol of intelligent beings, is 'almost certain,'\" and that the U.S. Government has denied access to technological in- formation \"of incalculable importance.\" Good also touched on the Roswell incident, noting that Brig. Gen. Thomas DuBose, chief of staff to Maj. Gen. Roger Ramey at the time, had admitted to a reporter that a \"containment strategy\" had been ordered by Gen. Clements McMullen, deputy commander of the Strate : gic Air Command.  ' , . Good recounted the'claims of a \"Dr. Cris,\" described as a Polish biophysicist \"who in 1974, on contract to NASA with an international team of scientists, was given some extraordinary fragments of odd metallic and plas- tic-like materials to analyze. The melting point of the 'metal' was above 2000C.\" Good adds, \"In 1977, at NASA's Jet Propulsion Labo- ratory in Pasadena, CA, the team met agaih,;-ahd Dr. Cris and four other scientists were taken to a restricted facility three floors below ground level where they were shown two plexiglass containers. In one could be seen what looked like the hip bone of a child; in the other, about one-third of a skull: 'The head was about as big as that of an elderly child,' reported Dr. Cris. 'It looked human-like, but derived neither from a child nor an ape...part of the skull protecting the brain was much thinner than a human's skull. There was even a short, small explanation: From the first and second incidents in New Mexico.'\" Good continued, \"Dr. Cris later learned that at least two spaceships, with at least three crew members, had crashed in 1947, and that one member of the second crew had survived. 'As I learned from biologists, their blood is similar to ours, but.. .shows an entirely different reaction toward oxygen; so inside the spaceship they must breathe a mixture of helium and oxygen, since nitrogen.. .is really not good for them.'\" Good discussed several other cases which are included in one or more of his books, including underwater UFOs, contactees, aerial displacement, the controversial photos of a \"creature\" taken by Italian painter and ceramics artisan Filiberto Caponi, and the reported capture of alien creatures in Varginha, Brazil, in 1996. He concluded his talk with an account which he received indirectly from \"a senior Air Force officer who worked in the USAF Air Staff and Joint Staff at the Pentagon.\" This account said that \"the aliens posed a threat to the envirpnmenrbecause they were 'messing around with tectonic plates,' and the presence of their craft was con- tributing to a 'warming of the waters.'\" It was also contended that \"bases in the continental U.S.-supposedly constructed by the aliens using their craft as 'boring' machines and with some assistance from the military-were said to have been located in Alaska, New Mexico, and West Virginia, and were periodically vacated then reactivated.\" In addition, \"The craft use a form of electromagnetic propulsion and are capable of August 2002 MUFON UFO Journal PageS"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"faster-than-light travel. The aliens were sharing some of their technology with us.\" Don Ledger: Air Traffic Control Zones, Pilots, Aircraft, and UFOs-Some Myths & Truths Don Ledger is the author of three books, the latest being Dark Object, co-authored with Chris Styles, which deals with the alleged crash of an object at Shag Harbour, Nova Scotia, in 1967.

He dis- Don Ledger cussed some of the \"ludicrous\" and \"irresponsible\" solutions to UFO encounters put out by debunkers arid others who do not understand aviation. He pointed out, for example, the limitations of ultra-light aircraft, which have been blamed by some debunkers for some night sightings, as well as the limitations on flying in controlled air space by any pilot. Speaking specifically of La Guardia, Kennedy, Teterboro, and Newark air spaces, Ledger said, \"This is not airspace to be entered by the faint hearted, not during the day, and especially not at night.\" Also discussed in some detail were Military Op- erations Areas (MOA), the characteristics of flares, and the maneuverabilty and vulnerability of the modern air- liner. Budd Hopkins: The Abduction Phenomenon- Where We Are Now Budd Hopkins, perhaps the world's best-known ab- duction researcher, is the. author of several books, as well as numerous articles and pa- pers. One of his best known books is Witnessed-The True Story of the Brooklyn Bridge UFO Abduction, which tells the story of \"Linda Cortile.\" He notes that two additional witnesses have recently come for- ward in that case. His latest book is Sight Unseen, which is co-authored with his wife, Carol Rainey. An artist by trade, Hopkins founded The Intruders Foundation (IF), a not-for-profit organization devoted to research and public education concerning the abduction phenomenon, in 1989. Although not part of his formal presentation, Hopkins provided an interesting account of an ongoing investiga- tion involving a team of physicians. The case involves a Budd Hopkins man who holds two doctorates who has been plagued for many years by incomplete memories of what seemed to be abductions. He refused hypnotic, regression because he did not want to relive the experiences, as he was al- ready frightened enough. His fear resulted in, among other things, almost compulsive concerns about having sufficient security devices around his home. :, ' •\"•<':' The situation came to a head in March of. this year when he was on his way to visit a friend. feHe backed out, of his garage, but then seemed to be coming back into his garage, as though he had forgotten something. He felt very strange, and went back into his home. After entering the kitchen, he collapsed. His wife, noticing blood on his.face and clothing, called 911. After regaining consciousness in the hospital emergency room, he discovered that he had lost several hours that he could not account for. The blood on his face had come from his nostrils, and there was scar tissue in the nostrils. The blood on his clothing was from bleeding from the bladder. In addition, there was semen in the bladder, which puzzled the doctors treating him. The man could not re- call what had happened. His personal physician, whom he had known for 38 years, had previously been informed of some of the man's experiences, including waking up one morning as a youngster with three raised circular red spots on an arm and a leg. The physician compared notes with some other physi- cians, who also had patients claiming or indicating the possibility of abductions. The man mentioned that Hopkins had been working with him, so the physicians met with Hopkins to see if he could assist. Hopkins told the doc- tors that he had four cases in his files of bleeding from the bladder after apparent abductions, including an individual in Israel, a policeman, and even a physician. He noted, however, that there may be more such cases, since he did not routinely inquire about bleeding bladders. ' Some of the doctors were working on a drug for alzheimer patients which was designed to help restore memory, and they wondered if it would help the man re- call what had happened. He agreed to try the experi- ment, and was able to provide an abduction account. As a result of this case the doctors formed a panel for the purpose of conducting a serious investigation of their patients who may have had abduction experiences. The doctors plan to document the in-depth study, based pri- marily on physical evidence, in a paper. Hopkins concluded that \"this case could be a turning point when doctors see that there are specific patterns in abductions.\" Specific details regarding the individual and. the doctors involved are not being released, since Hopkins does not want to interfere with the independent nature of the study. » - Turning to his main topic, he reviewed the history of abductions, including the Betty and Barney Hill case, not- ing that modern science has now caught up with one of the key descriptions of the medical exam which Betty Hill provided. In 1966, when Betty told of having a needle inserted in her navel as a pregnancy test, this procedure seemed to have nothing to do with pregnancy tests. \"But then\" said Hopkins, \"some years later along came a widely Page 6. MUFON UFO Journal August 2002"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"used real-world procedure called amniocentesis in which a needle is inserted through the navel of a pregnant woman to extract amniotic fluid for analysis of the state of the pregnancy.\" He adds, \"And, of course, since then thousands of fe- male abductees throughout the world have reported the same needle-in-the-navel procedure, just as male abductees have reported humiliating and often painful sperm-sampling procedures such as the one Barney suf- fered.\" Hopkins noted that later male abductees could not have copied from Barney's account, since this was omitted from The Interrupted Journey for reasons of taste. Hopkins said that \"virtually all of the scientific discov- eries of the past forty years which in any way bear on the UFO and abduction phenomena help support the plausi- bility of these phenomena, rather than contradicting them.\" He backed up this statement with examples from as- tronomy and space research, as well as discoveries re- garding genetics. Hopkins wrote about the hybridization phenomenon in his second book, Intruders (1987), as a theory explaining the sexual aspects of abductions, as well as multiple ab- ductions of the same individual. \"Many scientists had a fit,\" he explained, \"even some scientists within the UFO research community who otherwise accepted the reality of abductions. Hybridization, in the sense of mixing an alien sperm cell with a human ovum and successfully pro- ducing viable offspring, was impossible, they said. Impos- sible!\" However, observes Hopkins, \"The supposedly unbreachable wall between species now seems as po- rous as our defenses against suicidal terrorists. A gene from a salmon has been successfully folded into the ge- netic makeup of a tomato in order to make that fruit more impervious to cold weather. A gene from a jellyfish has been inserted into a rabbit, which now, we are told, some- times glows in the dark. I shudder to think of the uproar I would have caused had I described the possibility of genetic manipulations such as these in my 1987 book.\" Hopkins adds, \"Just because my data have stood the test of time, and many of the genetic theories have not, I am not claiming any special wisdom or prescience. What I am claiming is that careful, conservative investigation and judicious weighing of personal testimony have always given UFO investigators the edge in our long-term battles with the fixed theoretical positions of fundamentalist sci- ence. Even such an article of faith as the speed of light as an absolute-the highest speed anything can reach-is now under critical fire by some theoretical physicists.\" In his new book, Sight Unseen, he and co-author (and wife) Carol Rainey discuss \"the present state of transgenics in context with case material dealing with new aspects of the alien reproductive program that I have un- covered. Such a complex topic naturally requires more time and space than I have at my disposal here, so I will not be able to carry it any farther.\" While looking at some of the theories that seem to be legitimate, Hopkins also noted some theories which have not been borne out by abduction research. He says that (1) The aliens presence on Earth is not going to warn us to take better care of our planet; (2) the abduction phe- nomenon is not a quasi-military operation being carried out by soldiers of the 82 nd Airborne Division or by Colin Powell or by squads of CIA agents in scary black cars; and (3) A third false belief about the abduction phenom- enon promulgated by the late Lt. Col. Philip Corso in The Day After Roswell is that it essentially ceased decades ago....It should not be a surprise to learn that the last three abduction cases I've begun to investigate happened within the last six months.\" Peter Robbins: An American in Suffolk- Reflections, Observations, and Updates on a Decade's Research Into Britain's Rendlesham Forest UFO Incident Peter Robbins, Editor-in-Chief of the website UFOcity.com, also writes a column for UFO Magazine called \"Webwatch.\" He has been involved in ufology for many years, has created and produced TV programs deal- ing with UFOs, and serves as Ex- ecutive Assistant for the Intruders Foundation. He was a contributing artist to Alien Encounters in the Mys- teries of the Unknown series of Time-Life Books. Robbins presented background information on his ten-year (1987- 1997) investigation of the 1980 (RAF) Bentwaters-Woodbridge UFO incident, also known as the Rendlesham Forest Incident, which eventually led to co-authoring a book on the case with Larry Warren called Left at East Gate (1997). Robbins gives a great deal of credit for the suc- cess of the investigation leading to the writing of the book to co-author Warren, noting his respect for the sometimes controversial ufologist. \"The Bentwaters incident straddles almost every known area of specialty study known to ufology,\" said Robbins: \"multiple eyewitness testimony (both military and civil- ian) confirming the reality of the incidents and their cover- up; fully authentic military reports and memoirs under- scoring how seriously officials took the incident and its implications; historic evidence in the form of previously documented UFO incidents in the same locations; confir- mations of ongoing, pre-December 1980 UFO incidents in the same locations; ground-to-air confirmations of the historic and primary events; RAF radar reports and pho- tographic evidence of the areas in question; physical evi- dence in the form of affected vs. unaffected soil samples, unusual/unexplained impression in the soil with an unusu- ally high background radiation count in the impressions themselves, and unusual or unexplained health complica- tions for at least several of the eyewitnesses and an origi- nal Air Force paperwork confirming this in Larry's case. I do not know of any other event in UFO history that can make the same claims.\" /M Peter Robbins August 2002 MUFON UFO Journal Page?"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"Robbins says that despite the features outlined above, as well as the involvement of the U.S. military, the only American book dealing with the case is Left at East Gate. He blames this on \"a kind of innately American chauvin- ism, i.e., if it didn't happen here, how important can it be? After all, we've got Roswell.\" His work on the case took its toll, he explains: \"As the months of work melted into years, my obsession with the case became more entrenched. My generally above-av- erage social skills began to wane, as did my normally out- standing sense of humor. I had bouts of what I would now characterize as paranoia, and my personal and pro- fessional life both suffered. For several of these years I held all but my family and closest friends at arm's length and became quite reclusive. \"Ironically, the one area of my life that continued to function in a relatively 'normal' way was to continue working as a writer. The mechanism that kept driving me to complete my part of the book and get it into print was a combination of stubbornness, idealism, fascination, and anger; pretty much the same factors that were so effec- tively driving my co-author.\" In looking at whether their book made a difference, Robbins pointed out that Georgina Bruni was given a copy, and she later did her own book on the case, You Can't Tell the People, which \"has helped to keep public and official attention focused on the events of December 1980....There is no question that Georgina's many offi- cial and unofficial connections and investigative experi- ence allowed her to make contact with numerous princi- pal and supporting players in this drama that I wasn't even able to get close to.\" But he adds, \"I am as sure as I can be that there would not have been a You Can't Tell the People without a Left at East Gate preceding it.\" Betty Hill: Miracles Betty Hill, of course, is the female participant in the most famous-and one of the earliest-abduction cases, along with husband Barney. She is the author of A Common Sense Ap- proach to UFOs. John Fuller's book, The Interrupted Journey, and the television movie, \"The UFO Incident\" described the Hill encounter. Betty opened her talk by looking at \"miracles\" she has experienced, including electricity, airplanes, satel- lites, and \"meeting astronauts from another planet.\" She then described the encounter which she and Barney experienced in September of 1961. Betty mentioned a point concerning their dog, Delsey that is not generally included in the Betty and Barney Hill story. Although Delsey's fear during the encounter has been described many times, Betty explained that the dog also developed a severe skin rash. \"The vet did not rec- ognize it,\" said Betty, \"but it was the beginning of ap- Betty Hill proximately two years of bouts with multiple kinds of rashes. When Delsey developed these rashes we recog- nized that we had taken long showers, but we had not bathed the dog.\" Barney, of course, had developed a circle of warts around his groin area four months after the incident. The Hills' second sighting of a UFO came in 1965 as she and Barney were leaving her parents' home in Kingston, NH. \"As we were leaving their street to go onto the main highway, we saw our second UFO,\" she explained. \"It was directly in front of us, just above tree top level, and rocking back and forth. Then it went to our left, came back, and to the left again. Then it went down.\" She said, \"We had the feeling it wanted us to follow them. Instead, we went back to my parents' home where my mother and my sister, Janet, decided to come with us as we followed it, because they knew the area. We drove down a narrow back road, but could not go to the area where we saw this craft go down, which was in the middle of a swamp. From that night on, whenever we went out at night we were paced by two or more UFOs. Both the homes of my parents and of Janet became centers of UFO activity.\" Betty said that she and Barney \"became a focal point of sightings by others\" after The Interrupted Journey was released. She said there had been daylight sightings in Exeter and Hillsboro in 1932, 1934, 1936, and 1938, with even more sightings after World War II began. Betty noted that after \"The UFO Incident\" was shown on TV in 1975, \"I became a focal point of those who thought they might have been abducted. I used Dr. Simon's formula in working with them. After we ruled out hallu- cinations, delusions, dreams, fantasies, and recall of some- thing seen, heard, or read, we considered that it might be a real experience.\" She says that \"the real abductions usually occurred in a rural, isolated area between dusk and 4 AM. Most involved two persons, some with three people, and occasionally one.\" Betty found that most people involved in abductions \"went to the police, the military, or both almost immedi- ately afterward to report a sighting. They remembered the events before they went on board and when they left. From my sample, approximately 50 percent were seen in the emergency room at the local hospital for breathing difficulties, loss of sense of balance, eyes that failed to focus, upset stomachs, eye infections, feelings of shaki- ness, and strange discolorations of their skin.\" She observed that \"each abduction was unique, as though the aliens were seeking some kind of specific in- formation. They showed no sexual interest in the abductee. No one had a second abduction, although they may see UFOs frequently. All considered their experience as posi- tive, with no need for therapy.\" Richard Thieme: Are There UFOs on Mars?

His article, \"Stalking the UFO Meme on the Internet,\" is taught in universities in Europe, Canada, Australia, and the U.S. His online column, \"Island in the Clickstream,\" is read around the world. Thieme, like many ufologists, said he became convinced that UFOs are not only real, but known well by our government, when he had the per- sonal experience of talking with an Air Force pilot about UFOs in 1978. Thieme said to the fighter pilot, who was the senior lay officer of Thieme's parish in Clearfield, UT, near Hill Air Force Base, \"You guys in your fastest fighters chase these things and can't catch them.\" Thieme says the pilot frowned and said, \"You're right. We chase the damned things and we can't catch them.\" \"Prior to 1978,\" said Thieme, \"I had been immersed in textual and other media accounts of UFOs, but it took that face-to-face conversation with someone I knew to cause a contextual shift. It made the subject real in a different way.\" He noted that \"it is often suggested that people who have had UFO experiences want publicity or notoriety, but my experience is the opposite.\" Thieme quoted an analyst with an intelligence organi- zation, who does not want his name used, as saying, \"Something that's funny in America is not funny every- where. Something that's funny for one year is not funny for fifty. And when over those fifty years, reports from all over the world agree in the small details.. .it suggests that it's real.\" That analyst's criteria for determining if something is genuine includes (1) It is international, (2) it is long term, and (3) the small details must be congruent. Among the accounts he has received from people was the experience of two teens who were fishing in a small Wisconsin lake just before dawn. One star caught their attention when it seemed to grow larger and brighter, be- coming a disk-shaped luminous object which descended toward the lake. It slowed as it approached the water, tilted up, and very slowly entered the water. There was a diffused glow in the otherwise dark water. After awhile it slowly came up out of the lake, and the water came off of it as if there was something on the surface instead of the surface itself. The object then accelerated rapidly, climbing high until it again looked like a star. Thieme also discussed the SETI (Search for Extrater- restrial Intelligence) project, and the fact that Dr. Jill Tarter, director for SETI, rejects all UFO reports as unworthy of scientific attention, saying that she fears their project, which is currently seeking to establish an endowment of $200 million so the work can continue in perpetuity, would be tarnished by association with a discredited field. She even stated that debunker Phillip Klass \"knows the foibles, lack of rigor, and downright lies that the majority of people in this field perpetrate.'.Thieme's appraisal of Klass was somewhat different: \"The sheer intensity of the negativ- ity of a committed 'debunker' like Klass... corroborated my priestly observation that atheists are often just as pas- sionately and blindly committee to NO as true believers are to YES. They believe in not believing with a fervor bordering on fanaticism, which undermines an objective appraisal of the data.\" Thieme concluded, \"When I reflect on ...conversa- tions with Edgar Mitchell, Richard Haines, John Schuessler, Peter Sturrock, Russ Estes, Mark Rodigher, friends, colleagues, and many others, it is difficult not to agree with Rodigher, who said, 'It's difficult to avoid the conclusion that some UFOs are non-terrestrial intelligently piloted vehicles. Whether they are interdimensional, alien, or something more bizarre than that, we can't tell.'\" Dr. David Jacobs: Building a Professional Community Dr. David M.

His latest book-and his first edited volume-is UFOs and Abductions: Chal- lenging the Borders of Knowledge, published by the University Press of Kansas. Although Dr. Jacobs normally discusses abduction cases and theories in his talks,.this year he dealt with the prob- lems and possibilities of bringing to- gether a community of scholars in- terested in ufology.  ..., : Looking back, Jacobs noted that at a MUFON conference in 1975 he had discussed the issue of why sci- entists have not paid attention to the UFO phenomenon. \"Obviously, it is a complicated issue, and there are many reasons why scientists have not engaged with UFOs,\" he said. \"And, as Stuart Appelle has so rightly pointed out, without the 'validation' inherent in academic support, it is doomed to exist outside of established sci- ence in the realm of pseudoscience and popular culture.\" Jacobs notes that \"without university support, funding for the phenomenon is virtually nonexistent through nor- mal channels. Apart from the enormous difficulties in- herent in the UFO phenomenon itself, the lack of funding causes scientists to ignore and dismiss it. For many uni- versity-based scientists, the ability to receive grants dic- tates their salary, national reputation, and advancement in their  field.\"  .  . Because of the unusual, almost unbelievable nature of ufology, most scientists and academics neither understand it nor want to understand it, he said, noting that his own specialty^-abductions-represents \"another level of disbe- lief that academics are asked to overcome.

The idea that space aliens are kidnapping people in se- cret, taking them through walls and windows, running re- David Jacobs August 2002 MUFON UFO Journal Page 9"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"productively-oriented procedures on them, and then re- turning the abductees complete with amnesia is not a con- cept that one can agree with because it.'sounds right.'\" Another barrier, said Jacobs, is \"the old contactee idea of benevolent, loving, human-centered aliens [which] has re-entered UFO and abduction lore.\" Jacobs also decried the activities of \"self-promoters, self-aggrandizers, con-men, mentally disturbed individu- als, publicity seekers, and other disreputable individuals, all of whom have garnered faithful believers willing to follow them anywhere while aggressively challenging any criticism of their opinions. Some are adept at gaining press attention, and much to serious UFO researchers' sorrow, they have, to a degree, succeeded in placing them- selves at the center of the UFO world-at least as far as the media is concerned.\" Because of this somewhat dismal situation with main- stream scientists and academics, said Jacobs, \"the UFO community early on tried to build its own research com- munity.\" APRO (Aerial Phenomena Research Organi- zation), NICAP (National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena), and MUFON recruited a number of professional scientists and academics as members of their boards and as consultants. \"I decided to attempt a rough approximation of the number of scholars, academics, scientists, and profession- als actually interested enough in the phenomenon to lend their name as a consultant to an organization, to give a paper at a UFO conference, or to contribute a chapter to a book,\" explained Jacobs. \"I was interested only in those people who were sympathetic to the subject and not de- bunkers.\" After combing through the various publications of the major organizations, he said, \"To my surprise, I found that especially since the early 1970s, over 750 academics, sci- entists, scholars, physicians, attorneys, arid other profes- sionals have lent their names to the UFO cause. This is an astonishingly high number considering the barriers to interest under which the UFO phenomenon has suffered over the years.\" All of these held doctorate degrees or the equivalent. He noted that \"the largest concentrations are in law, medicine, and psychotherapy. But, in fact, the profes- sionals cover virtually all the major fields within a tradi- tional university. These include the physical sciences, the biological sciences, earth sciences, social sciences, hu- manities, education, engineering, communication, and so on. These fields can be further compartmentalized into chemistry, physics, history, astronomy, English, linguistics, anthropology, etc. The extent of the interest accurately mirrors the interdisciplinary nature of the UFO and ab- duction phenomenon, and it is exactly the kind of commu- nity that is so necessary for our field. Each discipline has a role in UFO research. Doctors of veterinary medicine, dentists, engineers, and others can play an important role in studying this subject.\" Jacobs observed that \"if each professional who came forward publicly to lend their names to studying the UFO phenomenon represents the opinion of just ten, or even only five, others who remain private, then it is obvious Page 10 MUFON UFO Journal that there is a large reservoir of untapped professionals who have been interested in the subject over the years- and who still are.\" He pointed out that \"the lists are riot the only indication that professional interest is widespread. When Budd Hopkins, John Carpenter, John Mack, and I gave a series of free workshops about the abduction phenomenon to members of the mental health community in Los Ange- les, Chicago, Atlanta, San Francisco, New York, and Ann Arbor, over 500 therapists attended the conference, and over 100 left their names as people who wanted to be on a mailing list to help abductees. Another 100 or so have written us with the same request.\" Jacobs added, \"Although I have paid the most atten- tion to the doctorates, the number of people with master's degrees who have lent their name to the subject is an- other large pool of potentially talented individuals. MUFON's 'research specialists' list numbered over 520 names. Familiar names dot the list, and it goes without saying that a doctorate is not a prerequisite for solid re- search and contribution to the field.\" He observed that \"like those of the doctorates, the dis- ciplines and professions that these individuals represent are varied and extensive. Of critical importance are the Certified Social Workers, Licensed Clinical Social Work- ers, and other members of the mental health community who do the bulk of mental health work in the United States. We must make every effort to enlist their aid.\" In concluding his presentation, Dr. Jacobs pointed out that \"publishing lists of names is not enough. A strategy of usage must be worked out to employ the intellectual power that these lists represent. It should be a two-way street: researchers must have access to them, and they must have access to the researchers and the data. I have a few preliminary suggestions: \"1. Members of all UFO organizations and private UFO researchers should identify the qualified professionals'in their states.... \"2. The email and state residences of every qualified scholar and professional should be published so that in- vestigators can have access to them.... \"3. Conferences of scholars, professionals, and others should take place in order to exchange data and to assign investigative and analytical responsibilities.... \"4. At least one new scholar or professional should be urged to give a paper at every MUFON symposium-na- tional or regional-and/or publish a paper in the MUFON UFO Journal or other publications.\" [Note: the details of Dr. Jacobs' presentation, includ- ing the names of professionals who have lent their names to ufological research, are included in this year's Sympo- sium Proceedings, available from MUFON, as are the papers of all of the other speakers described above.] Dan Wright: Five Themes on UFO Abductions Dan Wright, who joined MUFON in 1978 as a State Section Director, has served as State Director for Michi- gan, as well as MUFON Deputy Director in charge of North American investigations.

Out of a meeting at the Massachusetts Institute of Tech- nology a decade ago came the Abduction Transcription Project, which Wright devised and managed. Financed by MUFON, it began in 1992 and ended in 1997. The project was the subject of Wright's presentation at the 1997 MUFON International Symposium, as well as at this year's symposium (as a substitute presenter). The presentation is in the 1997MUFON Symposium Proceedings, and is not included in the 2002 Proceedings. The Abduction Transcription Project involved the transcription by more than 80 transcribers of more than 900 audio tapes of mostly hyp- nosis sessions, involving 254 abduc- tion cases. \"This was a difficult task, as you can imagine,\" said Wright, who then organized the transcribed material. Of the 254 cases, \"only Dan Wn S ht about half had good, solid value as far as the project was concerned,\" he noted. So, in effect, the project repre- sents about 125 cases. Out of these cases emerged several different groups of entities. Those abductees who had multiple experi- ences were more likely to meet more types of entities. Wright listed the groups as: Flight attendants^those who took and returned the abductees, but did little else; Doctor-trie entity who seemed to be clearly in charge; Technicians-the entities who did the routine procedures; Female-the entity who calmed the abductees; Familiar being-the entity that the abductee had seen or known prior to the current abduction; Nordics-human-like, one group being especially attrac- tive, and another group with a high forehead; Ancient one-very old, respected by the other entities; Reptoids-tended to be the mean ones. Five themes emerged from the project: (1) human sexu- ality and reproduction, (2) an alien connection outside the current life, (3) a mission for the future, (4) an impending catastrophe for the Earth, and (5) U.S. Government in- volvement with the aliens. The human sexuality and reproduction theme was present in 110 of the cases. For women this typically involved removal of an egg, impregnation with an embryo (possibly a hybrid), and abortion after two to three months of pregnancy. For males it typically involved the removal of sperm by a special mechanical device. However, there were also instances of rape involving both male and fe- male abductees. During a later abduction, babies may be shown to the abductees. The alien connection theme was present in 70 cases, and seemed to involve a feeling oh the part of the abductee that the abductee had been involved with the aliens out- side the conscious life, perhaps in a previous lifetime-and perhaps had even given permission for the abductions. The mission for the future theme was present in 79 cases. Although the mission was never clear, prepara- tion nught involve the acquisition of special skills, psychic or healing ability. The impending catastrophe theme was present in 37 of the cases, and shown to the abductees through the use of telepathy, through a movie or TV screen-like device, or through mental imaging. Wright noted that the catas- trophes seemed to be tailored to fit particular time peri- ods: during the time when nuclear energy was a wide- spread fear, a nuclear disaster might be the catastrophe suggested. At other times it might be fire, volcanoes, or earthquakes. More recently the theme seems to be glo- bal warming or other environmental concerns. \"Is this idea of catastrophes only a ruse to gain mental control over the abductees, as if only the entities can save us?\" asked Wright. \"I wonder.\" The involvement of the U.S. Government with entities theme was present in 42 of the cases. This usually in- volved scenes showing the military and the aliens work- ing together, suggesting a liaison between our govemment- or at least some part of our government-with one or more alien groups. However, some of the cases indicated that at least some of the alien groups did not have a connec- tion with our government. Harassment of abductees fol- lowing abductions by what appeared to be military per- sonnel or aircraft was also reported. Some of the \"commonalities\" reported by Wright in- cluded such details as the strapping down of children dur- ing examinations, but the use of paralysis on older abductees. There also seemed to be different levels of control, Wright concluded. Children were controlled less while on board (despite the strapping during exams), had more awareness, and were more likely to be given a tour. Women were more restrained than children, but were still aware of their surroundings. Men were restrained by the entities, and seemed to have only a dull awareness of their surroundings. The use of touch by the aliens was also commonly reported, whether to calm the abductee, relieve pain, or even to put the abductee to sleep. The common means of communication was telepathy, and when the entities communicated among themselves, the sounds made no sense to the abductees. Wright looked at the possible implications of the project findings: Is there a program of reproduction of quasi-hu- man beings? Did abductees give prior permission for the abductions? What will the promised missions be? If cur- rent abductees are to carry out missions, is some major event just around the corner? Will Earth be destroyed? Is the government involved with aliens; if so, is it one group or several groups, and what does this mean? If the government is involved with aliens, does the President know? In looking at what the project says about abductees, Wright classified them into three groups: Victims-abductees who experience frequent and sub- stantial pain, feel humiliation, do not understand the pur- pose of the abductions, feel no connection with the enti- ties, have no mission to perform, tell only a few people about their abductions, and strongly feel they should be left alone.

Evangelists- Experiencers who have more awareness, have more freedom on board, accept that they have a mission, feel a connection with the enti- ties, are given new abilities, and want to publicize their experience. Several specific shared details emerged from the project, Wright observed, \"that argue for commonal- ity among cases. Many have only rarely or never at all been published or aired on television.\" These include (1) Par- ticles within a beam of light or nausea/dizziness from be- ing levitated; (2) A ship's pink interior lighting, hallway benches, or large tank of liquid; (3) Ingestion of a syrupy fluid; (4) The near-paper quality of a sheet over the prone subject; (5) Entities showing confusion or surprise; (6) Lab-type coats worn only by authority figures; (7) A flex- ible instrument with a peculiar tip used to extract ova; (8) Gowns worn by children, always white and of simple de- sign; (8) Imagery of an oversized snowy owl; and many more. Wright cautioned that testimony coming through hyp- nosis is not infallible, and that even if the abductees are accurately reporting their experiences, there is no guar- antee that the entities are being honest. This project is an attempt to organize the testimony of a large number of abductees in order to look at major themes and common- alities. \"It provides evidence, not proof,\" said Wright. Esen Sekerkara: Turkish UFO Investigations Ms. Esen Sekerkara, a graduate of Istanbul University, Turkey, got in- volved with ufology in 1998 with the opening of the Sirius UFO Space Sci- ences Research Center (SUSSRC), where she served as vice-president. It is the first center for collecting and researching ufological data through- out Turkey, and has organized three international UFO symposiums. She is also one of the three founders of the International UFO Museum, which opened Jan. 18 in Istanbul. Ms. Skekerkara discussed several aspects of UFO activity and research in Turkey, including photo evidence, videos, a close encounter, and abductions. She noted that Esen Sekerkara MUFON International Director John Schuessler presented special certifi- cates of appreciation to New York Assistant State Director Bob Long and State Director Jim Bouck for their efforts in hosting this year's Symposium. official secrecy seems to be lessening at times, but that the government is still not forthcoming with information or access to military witnesses. Ms. Skekerkara said that there were numerous sightings prior to a major earth- quake in Turkey which killed 17,000 people, and that the sightings were in the areas hardest hit by the quakes. She presented several photos and videos of what were reported to be UFOs, as well as videos of witness inter- views. One 1996 case involved two men who were hik- ing when they observed a daylight UFO and took clear photos of it. Six months later they were in the same area and again photographed a UFO in daylight. \"They did not report the photos until four years later,\" said Ms. Skekerkara, \"for fear of ridicule.\" The photos were analyzed by the head of a university photography department, who said they were not hoaxed. A similar finding was made by a Kodak lab in Istanbul, she said. Another case involved what a newspaper described as a \"dog fight\" between a Turkish Air Force jet and an unidentified object, which moved around and flew beside the training jet. The official explanation was a weather balloon, despite the fact that there were none in the area. Ms. Sekerkara told about a close encounter between villagers and a robot-like entity, with one man getting within 6 feet of it. The entity seemed to float just above the ground, have no arms, and have legs connected. Strange lights glowed from \"head\" and \"abdomen.\" The \"eyes\" seemed painted on. The entity rose and disappeared. An abduction case involved a friend of Ms. Sekerkara. The woman felt sadness each time she saw young girls, and hypnotic regression by Budd Hopkins and John Mack, who were in Turkey for a symposium, indicated that the woman had a child-apparently a female hybrid. Ms. Skekerkara said there are many UFO incidents being reported in Turkey, and that the mass media were eager to report on them. Page 12 MUFON UFO Journal August 2002"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"Comets and UFO crashes: Part 2 Did a UFO Crash at Aurora, Texas? By Chris Aubeck ©2002 A newspaper report from 1897 claimed that a space- craft and its otherworldly pilot had crashed in Aurora, TX, a peaceful hamlet just 45 miles north of Dallas. The story would be ignored for 70 years, but did eventually become one of the most debated topics in ufology. The original article, published in the Dallas Morning News, the Dallas Times Herald and in the Fort Worth Register, ran as follows: Aurora, Wise Co., Tex., April 17. - (To the News) - About 6 o'clock this morning, the early risers of Aurora were astonished at the sudden appearance of the airship which has been seen sailing through the country. It was travelling due north, and much nearer the earth than ever before. Evidently some of the machinery was out of or- der, for it was making a speed of only ten or twelve miles an hour and gradually settling toward the earth. It sailed directly over the public square, and when it reached the north part of town collided with the tower of Judge Proctor's windmill and went to pieces with a ter- rific explosion, scattering debris over several acres of ground, wrecking the windmill and water tank, and de- stroying the judge's flower garden. The pilot of the ship is supposed to have been the only one on board, and while his remains are badly disfigured, enough of the original has been picked up to show that he was not an inhabitant of this world. Mr T. J. Weems, the United States signals service officer at this place and an authority on astronomy, gives it as his opinion that he was a native of Mars. Papers found on his person-evidently the records of his travels-are written in some unknown hieroglyphics, and cannot be deciphered. The ship was too badly wrecked to form any conclu- sions as to its construction or motive power. It was built of an unknown metal, resembling somewhat a mixture of aluminium and silver, and it must have weighed several tons. The town is full of people today who are viewing the wreck and gathering pieces of the strange metal from the debris. The pilot's funeral will take place at noon to- morrow. S. E. HAYDON. The three newspapers in which the story was pub- lished described the event with the same details, except the Fort Worth Register, which did not mention the hi- eroglyphics. As exciting as the prospect of finding an extraterres- trial spacecraft should have been, there is no evidence to show that the dispatch was taken seriously by anybody at the time. There was no contemporary follow-up of the event, and no academic body offered to carry out an au- topsy of the corpse or an analysis of the debris. No sketches were made, and no photographs were taken of what would surely have been an astounding event and a revolutionary moment in science. It took over seventy years for anybody to take a seri- ous look at the story. During an important UFO flap in the United States, journalist Frank Tolbert decided to make some inquiries for himself to see whether there was any truth to S. E. Haydon's article. Tolbert, himself a writer for the Daily Morning News, had long been interested in the wave of airship sightings that had swept America in the 1890s, and he realized that the spectacular nature of the Aurora crash would make it the easiest of the cases to substantiate, if it were true. Upon interviewing the retired men and women who had been living in Aurora since the end of the nineteenth century, however, he was told that the whole episode had been a hoax perpetrated by radio operators and was merely a piece of entertainment, no different from any of the other spoofs published at the time. When his conclu- sions were published in Flying Saucer Review in 1973 in an article entitled \"Aurora Spaceman - RIP?\" it seemed to most ufologists that there was little more to say on the matter. In fact, as early as 1966 Dr. J. Allen Hynek had sent a researcher to the site to probe a little further and learned that there had never been a windmill on Proctor's farm and that T. J. Weems, said to have been a signals officer in the article, had actually been a blacksmith. He was also informed that S. E. Haydon (or \"E.E. Haydon\"), a local cotton-buyer and a writer, had probably invented the tale to attract tourism to the little town. This would have been the end of the line for \"the Au- rora incident\" if separate investigations had not shed en- tirely different light on the affair. William Case, aviation writer for the Dallas Times Herald, was alerted to the story by Hay den Hewes of the International UFO Bu- reau in the spring of 1973. Another journalist, Jim Marrs, then an aerospace/aviation writer at the Fort Worth Star- Telegram, also became interested, and soon both men were actively involved in the search for the ultimate an- swer. Case had spoken to some of the oldest residents in Aurora and was convinced that something had indeed crashed on Proctor's farm. He had learned that there were only four people in Aurora old enough to have any recollection of the events, and three of them supported the reality of the story. One of these was Etta Oates. Brawley and Etta Oakes purchased Judge Proctor's farm in 1945 and lived there for many years. Although Brawley died just before inter- est in the incident was renewed, Mrs Oakes was able to tell the researchers that she \"had heard the story for years. Nothing grew for years in that one spot in the field where that spaceship is supposed to have hit.\" As Jim Marrs points out in his 1997 book Alien Agenda, the Oates fam- ily had been plagued by serious medical problems through- out the time they lived on the property, including cysts and August 2002 MUFON UFO Journal Page 13"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"goiters (a swelling of the thyroid gland in the neck). This was blamed on the water they took from the well. \"I've been told it's radioactive,\" Mrs Oakes told Marrs. Charlie C. Stephens was another old-timer who re- called the events with a clear mind, despite being 83 years old at the time of the interview. Although at first he \"didn't want to get involved,\" Marrs was eventually able to coax him into giving his version of the story. Stephens explained that he had been less than ten years old when he and his father, out in the pasture with some cattle, saw an illuminated cigar-shaped object pass over- head in the direction of Aurora. They heard an explosion and the sky seemed to light up with fire for several min- utes. The boy wanted to rush off to town to see what was going on, but his father \"said we had to finish our chores.\" The next day, the elder Mr. Stephens paid a visit to the town, where he saw a \"a mass of torn metal and. burned rubble.\" He did not mention to his family seeing a dead pilot, which is logical enough if the being had been buried on the day of the crash. \"During the years I was growing up he told me the story many times,\" said Charlie Stephens. G. C. Curley, a 98-year-old man then residing in a nurs- ing home in Lewisville, told the researchers that two of his friends had galloped off to Aurora to see the wreck of the spaceship: \"They told me the airship had been seen coming from the direction of Dallas the day before and had been sighted in the area. But no one knew what it was. They said it hit something near Judge Proctor's well. The airship was destroyed and the pilot in it was badly torn up. My friends said ther£ was a big crowd of sight- seers who were picking up pieces of the exploded air- ship. But no one could identify the metal it was made of. We didn't have metal like that in America at that time. And they said it was difficult to describe the pilot. They saw only a torn up body. They didn't say people were frightened by the crash. They just couldn't understand what it was.\" The only other witness found by Case and Marrs was a ninety-one-year-old woman called Mary Evans. She told the researchers: \"I was only fifteen at the time and had all but forgotten the incident until it appeared in the papers recently. We were living in Aurora at the time, but my mother and father wouldn't let me go with them when they went up to the crash site at Judge Proctor's well. When they returned home they told me how the airship had exploded. The pilot was torn up and killed in the crash. The men of the town who gathered his remains said he was a 'small man' and buried him that same day in Au- rora cemetery. That crash certainly caused a lot of ex- citement. Many people were frightened. They didn't know what to expect. That was years before we had any regu- lar airplanes or other kinds of airships.\" Did some anomalous vehicle crash on a farm in Au- rora in April 1897 or not? Strictly speaking, the \"Aurora crash\" cannot be considered an outright hoax, based on the information we currently possess. Sceptics cite Wise County historian Etta Pegues, who was sure that Haydon's article was \"a beautiful piece of fiction.\" She said, \"I have talked to people who were alive then. They, all said Judge Proctor had no windmill.\" There are three problems with this statement. First, it is not true that none of the older generation believed in the Aurora crash, as revealed by the witness testimonies reproduced above. Secondly, far too much has been read into the reference to \"Proctor's windmill.\" None of the witness testimonies refer to a windmill in their descrip- tions of the crash, only to the old well. Haydon may have been misinformed about this point, just as he could have got the name of the military officer wrong. The third point to bear in mind is that Etta Pegues' main source of information was Robbie Reynolds Hanson, who told her that the story was a hoax. Hanson had been twelve years old in 1897 and was living outside Aurora with her parents. There are two reasons why the Aurora incident has been dismissed by modern researchers. The first is that the whole case has become something of a circus, full of claims and counter-claims that have generally led nowhere. An effort to locate the \"small man's\" grave only suc- ceeded in angering the locals. Foreseeing the intentions of Case and Marrs, a band of Aurora residents kept a tight control on access to the cemetery, just in case any- one started digging up coffins without authorization, and threatened to seek restraining orders against trespassers. The city marshal, the sheriff and two deputies patrolled the site for two weeks while two UFO organizations com- peted to be the first to exhume the body. Meanwhile Case believed he had traced the pilot's resting place, a small grave marked only by broken headstone. The only thing carved into it was a \"<\" shape containing three small circles, and when Case passed his metal detector over the grave it detected at least three large pieces of metal buried underneath. Unfortunately, the headstone fragment disappeared the night after the marshal called off the patrols, and the mys- terious metal was stolen not long after this. A similar state of affairs surrounded the search for metal pieces at Judge Proctor's farm. The first serious attempt was in 1967 when Alfred Kraus of West Texas State University brought in a metal detector. However the only metallic items he found were old stove lids and other domestic litter. Then, in 1973, Case reported that Brawley Gates had come across some silvery pieces of metal while cleaning out the well. A laboratory analysis carried out by physi- cist Dr. Tom Gray of the North Texas State University revealed the metal to be aluminium alloy, a material used in the 1920s to make kitchen utensils. In 1974 Bill Case tried to arrange for a subsurface radar scan of the grave, but died before this could be carried out. Since then no further developments in the case have come about, and the entire issue is treated with utmost scepticism. Not surprisingly the Aurora incident has been described by a writer for Fortean Times as \"Roswell's stillborn twin.\" The second reason to doubt the authenticity of the Aurora incident is the historical context in which it emerged. It must be borne in mind that UFO crashes were a popular newspaper-selling gimmick in the final years of the nineteenth century.

The first-time-ever presentation was made by Larry Landsman, Director of Special Projects for the SciFi Channel. The 10-night series, which begins Dec. 1, tells the story of three families over multiple generations as they dear with the abduction phe- nomenon in various ways. \"Not only does Steven Spielberg serve as Executive Pro- ducer,\" said Landsman, \"but he has also brought his vision to the project in a hands-on fashion as a key editor on the series. Further- more, the story of our three fami- lies is Steven's brainchild along with writer Les Bohem, whose shared vision has brought the saga to life.\" Landsman provided some background on Spielberg, ex- plaining, \"When he was 17 years old, Steven's first fea- ture-length movie was called 'Firelight,' and, believe it or not, it was about UFOs abducting humans. The movie premiered on March 24, 1964, at the Phoenix Little The- atre. Now remember, this was well before the phenom- enon was made public. Incidentally, Steven eventually spent over two years developing this early teenage film 'Fire- light' into a major motion picture which some of you may have heard of-it was called 'Close Encounters of the Third Kind.'\" The upcoming mini-series \"Taken\" begins with Russell Keys, an American World WWII pilot who is dying of a bullet wound while his plane spirals toward enemy terri- tory. Blue lights on the horizon interrupt his plane's de- scent-and sometime later he and his squadron find them- selves mysteriously whole and healed on safe ground, with no memory of how they got there. Only years later, as each member of the squadron dies inexplicably, does Keys understand that his life has been forever altered by his first extraterrestrial encounter. Haunted, he searches for answers to his unfolding memories, only to realize that he is pbwerless to prevent his son and subsequent genera- tions from also becoming abductees. When the 1947 crash of a UFO at Roswell occurs a few years after Keys' first encounter, U.S. military man Owen Crawford leverages his knowledge of the event to become a major player in the subsequent cover-up. Shortly after the 1947 crash, a chance encounter with a wounded man nearby sets off its own strange chain of events. Sally Clarke is a lonely woman who unexpectedly finds love in the arms of a stranger. Despite her conviction that she has interacted with something not of this world, the other members of the Clarke family are unconvinced. The story of the three families is told through the voice of Allie Keyes, Russell Keyes' 10-year-old great-grand- daughter. Following the showing, Landsman announced that \"be- cause of the years of research that went into 'Taken,' research made possible through the pioneering efforts of men like Budd Hopkins, David Jacobs, and John Mack, just to mention a few, and because of what that research brought to light, our network, with support from its parent company, Vivendi Universal, is now poised to take an unprecedented public position designed to draw to the nation's attention the considerable and overwhelming evi- dence pointing to the existence of an ongoing, systematic incursion by an unknown intelligence.\"   ' Black helicopters spotted in strange locations Question: What has six rotors, is colored camoflauged grey with stripes, and flies at treetop level in Rehoboth, MA (population 7,600)? Answer: The newest breed of \"black helicopters\" which were active in the USA just before and after the Fourth of July national holiday. On Thursday, June 20, 2002, a woman living in a sub- urb of Minneapolis, MN, reported, \"My husband, neigh- bor, and I were out in the backyard last weekend in the late afternoon when we suddenly became aware of the sound of an approaching helicopter. We don't live too far from a hospital with a helicopter landing pad, so we as- sumed that was what it was. But the sound grew louder and louder with two low-flying, totally-black helicopters that flew right overhead, heading towards downtown Minneapolis. I had always thought the black helicopters were a myth...until now.\" On Friday, June 28,2002, Gwendolyn D. spotted \"black helicopters at night, flying without navigation lights, going from north to south at low altitude over the Genesee River\" in Gates, N. Y. (population 29,275), about 5 miles west of Rochester. \"One or two had spotlights aimed at the ground,\" Gwen added. Beginning on Tuesday, June 25, 2002, UFO Roundup correspondent Mary Lou Jones-Drown began hearing \"very loud helicopter noise\" in Rehoboth, MA. From in- terviewing witnesses, she learned that mysterious heli- copters, black and otherwise, \"equipped with spotlights,\" were seen flying over the Palmer River School on the north side of Route 44, just west of Rehoboth Village. \"I heard helicopter noise in the early morning, and looked up, but did not see any helicopters.\" A farm owner in South Rehoboth told Mary Lou that \"two black helicop- ters with spotlights were flying in formation above the trees. The choppers came from the southeast, from Mount Hope Bay in Swansea (MA).\" -UFO Roundup August 2002 MUFON UFO Journal Page 15"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"Filer's Files. By George A.

Asteroid barely misses Earth The Earth narrowly missed be- ing struck by an asteroid the size of a football field on June 14. Astrono- mers apparently failed to spot the asteroid that missed Earth by only 75,000 miles until three days after it flew past. This is a comparatively close miss that could have caused major damage on Earth. If the asteroid hit Earth in a populated area the explo- sion could have caused major damage. It is not known if classified military satellites had picked up the object, which passed by Earth at less than a third of the distance to the moon.  : If the asteroid had hit in a populated area it could have caused considerable loss of life similar to a nuclear explo- sion. Hitting the ocean, the asteroid would have likely caused damaging tidal waves. The asteroid, provisionally named 2002 MN, was trav- eling at more than 23,000 mph when it-was spotted. NASA concentrates its' efforts on bodies bigger than one kilome- ter across. Asteroids of this size could potentially destroy civilization as we know it. Comparatively small amounts of money are spent to spot and protect Earth from incoming visitors. Currently, there is no dedicated program searching for objects of 2002-MN's size, although Britain is testing telescopes on the Spanish Island of La Palma that might eventually spot smaller asteroids. New Jersey object FREEHOLD — The witness was driving back from her boyfriend's house at around 10:45 PM when she no- ticed bright lights hovering in the sky. \"I thought it had to be a helicopter, since I have never seen any other aircraft hover that way, but as I drew closer I realized it was much too large,\" she says. \"I came up to a stop sign and watched as the now evidently enormous aircraft hovered for awhile longer before gliding off over the trees. It had many bright lights and looked like a spacecraft right out of ET. Not all the lights were white but I can't clearly remember the colors of the others; maybe red and green?\" Thanks to Peter Davenport Director, NUFORC http:// .www.filersfiles.com Close sighting in Kansas WICHITA — The witness reports, \"Two of us were lying in the pool watching a large cumulus cloud at 9 PM and noticed a UFO flying due north at 100-200 mph. The shape was an inverted cone about four feet in diameter at approximately 400 feet altitude, with no sound. It was gone in approximately one minute. It was probably 3 feet in diameter on the top and 5 feet in diameter at the bot- tom. \"When it flew over, it was circular from the bottom. It flew over the Wichita airport, but did not make any noise, and it wasn't a bird, balloon, or plane. I have a science education, and have worked for two aerospace firms.

The mystery in Argentina grows with a wild boar added the list of cows, horses, guanaco, and sheep being muti- lated. The wild boar is highly distrustful and detects- through their sharp olfactory system-the presence of strangers, but an eight-month-old boar was found muti- lated. The mutilation count is now reaching 170, and the cases recorded extend to nine Argentinean provinces. This is the sixth species found with mutilations, lack of blood, with geometrically perfect incisions, and missing the anus, tongue and jaw.. To the surprise of the rancher and his farmhand, the animal was still soft in spite of the- 14 C temperature. \"It's impossible that an animal could remain in this condition after being dead and after the cold,\" said the rancher.    ;, A mysterious situation also occurred to the north of the Pampan town of Rancul at the \"Los Caldenes\" ranch, where a cow had died of natural causes in the afternoon only to be found with incisions on its jaw: and missing its tongue the next day. The province of Entre Rios has also experienced these events: in a field, a rancher found a 170 kg heifer and a 500 kg., milk cow some 800 meters from each other, both presenting the notorious incision marks. Strange dwarf-like midgets have been reported wan- dering the backyards of many neighborhoods in General Acha. A short, green entity which runs away with haste when detected has been reported.

The stories have been reported in the news and on radio stations. Red intense lights, as though from a laser, mov- ing very quickly across the countryside are being reported. Veterinarian Omar Fernando Lopez also observed a new case that involved a pregnant cow found in the fields of Juan Carlos Robilotte, showing the same incisions, with the difference that the cow was about to give birth. There was a circle [on the left flank, above the udder] through which half of the calf's body was protruding. A racehorse of the Quarter Horse breed, belonging to stables near the town of Choele Choel, was found dead with strange mutilations. \"It was as though it had been hollowed out from within,\" reported police sources in de- scribing the stud horse, of considerable economic value. Veterinarian Carlos Montobbio, who certified the case, reported that the horse was missing an eye and tongue, but no incisions on the maxillary had been performed. It had also been castrated and a significant part of its small intestine and rectum had been removed. CARHUE — Several residents claimed to have seen strange lights related to the presence of UFOs. The para- discuss@yahoogroups.com reported a letter from Argen- tina stating, \"We have great fields and a lot of cattle in Patagonia. In April, gauchos found some cows dead with perfect mutilations, with eyes, jugular vein, nipples and genitals removed. Virtually the same parts were cut and cauterized in a perfect way. The mutilated animals seem to be dropped from the air. Cults were ruled out because the bodies do not have any cult marks or symbols. There are no footprints and carrion do not eat the dead body. Perhaps even more astounding is the sudden disappearance of water from reservoirs and tanks during the night. Frogs were found dead in reservoirs where one hun- dred thousand liters of water disappeared over night. Obviously frogs can live for long periods without water, so their death may be a clue to the mystery. Argentina does not have sophisticated tools or advanced equipment to do research. Manuel Alesso and Raul Blengio, two rural cattlemen owning property in the Paraje Cilley area saw lights be- tween 7:30 and 8 PM. \"I was touring the fields of Arroyo Venado when I saw two lights to the northeast,\" said Alesso. He added that he stopped his pickup truck and flashed his headlights at the lights. \"The lights began to shine even brighter and seemed to descend, which is why I went over to where Raul Blengio was planting and told him to look. The lights were white, round, and gave off a sort of haze,\" adding that \"behind the light there was another, less shiny one.\" Raul Blengio stated that the lights moved slowly. A third witness ac- companying them also saw the lights. \"I'm certain they have something to do with the cattle mutilations,\" he added. RIO CUARTO — Researchers at the Universidad Nacional De Rio Cuarto reiterated that the calf found mutilated in Berrotaran presented \"clean incisions\" in its hide, thus discarding any attacks by predators. They ad- mitted \"in principle, the conclusions applied by SENASA cannot be applied,\" referring to the University of Tandil's report which fingered the red-muzzled mouse (oxymycterus rufus) as the principal culprit in the cattle mutilations. Jaime Polop, a specialist in Rodent Ecology for 24 years with the National University of Rio Cuarto, stated that the presence of this type of mouse is \"mini- mal\" in the southern provinces, and expressed doubts re- garding the possibility that this animal is the key to un- locking the nationwide mystery. He declared that while the red-muzzle mouse is om- nivorous and feeds on vegetable and animal organic mat- ter, it is \"very rare\" that it should consume carrion and the information from the University of Tandil is the first we've received regarding this type of behavior by oxymycterus.\" He said, \"The oxymycterus has chisel-shaped teeth, and it is impossible for that type of dentition to produce clean cuts on animal hides. Its bite is similar to any mouse chewing, which would never be mistaken for a surgical implement.\" He also noted that the muzzled mouse \"is not a preda- tor; normally, when a predator such as a fox begins [by eating] the entrails, it continues to feed from the same open wound. To find lesions on the mouth, abdomen, and anus, and to see this pattern repeating itself, draws my attention considerably,\" added Polop. Mutilation of sheep in Mexico JUAREZ — The Grupo Juarense de Investigacion Ovni is investigating the mysterious mutilations of sheep in that region, possibly the first since 1996-1997.

Thanks to Scott Corrales, Institute of Hispanic Ufology First cattle mutilation report from Uruguay The discovery of a dead cow on June 24,2002, whose tongue, eyes and genitals were extracted in a livestock region of the Uruguayan interior has raised concern in the country.

Mayor Carmelo Vidallin tried to cool down rumors by saying that \"we must await the expert's verdict,\" refer- ring to the Ministry of Livestock and Agriculture, which is working at the site. The mayor said, \" No signs of blood or a struggle be- tween the animal and its victim were found.\" Obscure esoteric practices at work has not been rejected, since they are common throughout the country.

Reviewed by Dwight Connelly This is the long awaited detailed report on what is per- haps the best known-and certainly the most studied-physi- cal traces case in the world. Ted Phillips, who has spe- cialized in physical trace studies for more than three de- cades, has studied this particular case for 29 years. This UFO event dates back to Nov. 2, 1971, when 16-year-old Ronald Johnson went out to the sheep pen on the Johnson farm near Delphos, KS, around 6:45 p.m. to do his chores. With Ron was his dog, Snowball. At about 7 p.m. Ron's mother, Erma Johnson, called to him that sup- per was ready, and he acknowl- edged the call. His father, Durel, was also inside the house. Ron immediately heard a rum- bling noise and stepped out from a small shed to observe a brightly-illuminated object about 75 feet away. It was hovering two to five feet above the ground along the edge of a tree shelter belt. The object was illuminated from top to bottom by multi-colored lights-a mass of blue, red, and orange colors over the entire surface. Ron could not make out any individual lights. It appeared that a shimmering material was falling from the object, and there was a bright glow between the base of the object and the ground. Ron estimated the object to have been about eight feet wide, and that the top was about ten feet above the ground. He could not see the surface of the object because of the glare of the lights, which illuminated nearby trees and hurt his eyes, but could make out a general shape. It appeared to be slightly domed at the top, with a bulge at the center of the display. Snowball stood very still and did not bark, but the nearby sheep were bleating, apparently disturbed by the noise or the lights, or both. Later, Mr. Johnson would report that the sheep would jump from the pen each evening for a week following the incident. Apparently the noise and the lights were related, since Ron was sure he would have seen the object before hear- ing the noise if it had already been illuminated. He said the noise was like an old washing machine out of bal- ance. After several minutes the object brightened at the base, tipped slightly toward the west, and began to move to the east, accelerating rapidly, clearing a hog shed by about four feet. As it cleared the shed the sound changed to a high-pitched sound like a jet aircraft. As the sound changed, Ron was unable to see any- thing-even spots before his eyes. After what seemed several minutes, he regained his vision, and could see a bright circular light beyond his house in the southern sky. He called to his parents, and all three observed the light, which was at that point half the size of a full moon, the color of an arc welder, and brighter than an auto headlight at 100 feet. The object gradually became smaller as it moved away. At about the same time, Lester Ernsbarger, a reserve police officer in Minneapolis, KS (about 10 miles south of Delphos) called in to report a circular, bright light in the sky to the north toward Delphos, moving south. As the Johnsons examined the area where Ron had seen the object, they noticed a circle which seemed to be glowing a bright gray-white color. Portions of nearby trees also seemed to glow. Durel and Erma touched the soil, which had a cool, glass-like feel. Erma then smelled her hand and noticed an unfamiliar odor. Her hand and finger became numb, and when she wiped her hand against her leg it also became numb (a condition which appar- ently persisted at least until 1998).   ; Durel also reported numbness in his hand. Erma went into the house, got a Polaroid camera, and shot the last picture on the roll. The glowing ring was clearly shown in the photo, although a flash was not used and the film had an ASA rating of only 75. In addition to the glowing circle, a dead tree had been knocked down, and a limb of a live tree had been broken, apparently by the object. With no law enforcement available in Delphos, Durel went to the local newspaper office less than a mile away and reported the encounter to editor Willard Critchfield, who was hard at work and declined to visit the site, say- ing he would send a reporter out the next morning. Want- ing someone else to see the ring before it disappeared, the Johnsons picked up their daughter-in-law, her friend, and the friend's 10-year-old son, all of whom viewed the ring. Local reporer Thaddia Smith did visit the next morning and photographed the circle. Law enforcement officials visited the site the same afternoon and took photos. Alerted by Dr. J. Allen Hynek, who saw a news re- port, Phillips arrived on the scene on Dec. 4, accompa- nied by Sheriff Ralph Enlow, who gave Phillips a sample of the soil he had collected the day after the encounter. The sheriff also gave a positive report on the honesty and credibility of the Johnson family. Phillips interviewed the witnesses and photographed and measured the site, then took samples within the circle, along the reported path of the object, and at other locations as control samples. The ring still contained a high concentration of white material, which was evident in all of the ring soil that Phillips ex- posed. He and Sheriff Enlow specifically looked for indi- cations of a hoax, but found no evidence suggesting this. The dog, Snowball, showed unusual erratic behavior in the days following the event, including running into the side of a building and a fence-with the sheriff and under- sheriff present.. The dog also refused to go into the ring.

This section was assigned to an isolated overnight ob- servation post in the h.irren hills which contained only mountains and villages The primary witness (PW) and his mates sacked oui in rhe GammaGoat, leaving a sentry awake and on duty 10 observe. After dark (appx. 11 PM), the sentry awoke everyone, telling them to get out- side fast and come \"look.\" They did. Observed was a perfectly cylindrical beam of soft pale white light, stationary, extending down from the sky to the ground, about 100-150 meters in height, 20- 25 meters wide, about 200 meters distant from their out- post and toward the side of a hill. Nothing could be ob- served at the top of the beam. They watched for 5-8 seconds, then the be.im receded back toward its top and vanished. -They begun u> walk out to where this occurred when suddenly (hree more column-like beams exactly like the first appeared in the same vicinity. These beams did not just appear, but they deployed (flowed) down to the ground, top to bottom over the period of about a second or so. The three beams were about 30 meters apart, and they too remained about 5-8 seconds before receding back up to the top to vanish (again flowing). Again, nothing solid or illuminated was seen at the top. Within 2-3 seconds there was a bright flash and a quick streak from the loca- tion of the vanished beams to the other side of a moun- tain, which was about 1/2 mile away. (Secondary wit- ness below described the initial arrival of the beams as being similar to this departure). Within 5-10 seconds the whole backside of the moun- tain lit up with a flash, making the sky glow, then it went out. No smells, sounds or other effects were noticed; the weather was COLD. PW indicated that the beams were precise, straight line beams, not dispersed like car lights. He saw nothing moving up or down within the beams, and added that they \"flowed\" down, then back up, taking a second or so to do that. He also added they were in a pretty remote outpost, and he doubted if any other U.S. forces would have been close enough to observe it. (You can just about take the size and distances de- scribed by the PW as the gospel mortar personnel are trained observers, able to judge distance, size, width, etc. very quickly and accurately, it's part of theirjob skills). Later, their platoon sergeant drove to their location, checking outposts as is normally done. They reported it, but it was not received very well by their PUSgt. Later, after daylight, the PW and his fellow soldiers went down to check the terrain the beams had hit. They found nu- merous BURIAL MOUNDS in that vicinity. When asked, the PW stated that the graves appeared undisturbed, being older graves, nicely grassed over. (It should be noted that graveyards dot the areas in which Korean villages are located). I made an effort to locate the other soldiers across the USA, but the only one found was living in north Georgia and by coincidence was a Sheets. He was the sentry on duty who first saw the approach and alerted his mates to wake up and come outside. He indicated that the first signs of the incident was a moving light that seemed to approach the area at the \"speed of light,\" then a flash, and the first column or beam of light appeared. His description of the subsequent ac- tions, which by then were jointly observed, closely matched that of the primary witness. -Tom Sheets, MUFON State Director, Georgia UFO Press... (Continued from Page 18) There are many other details reported in the book re- garding the investigation at the site, including numerous photos and verbatim interviews with the witnesses. The latter part of the book includes actual reports from such laboratories as Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Waksman Institute of Microbiology at Rutgers University, and the Soils Laboratory at Utah State University. A detailed ar- ticle from the Journal of UFO Studies by Erol A. Faruk, a chemist from Great Britain who analyzed the soil samples, is included in the book. Details on Faruk's back- ground are, unfortunately, not provided. Also included was an article by Michael Swords sum- marizing his interpretation of the tests that were done of the soil samples. The results of the many tests over a period of many years suggests that the circle is not a hoax, and cannot be adequately explained by natural fac- tors or conventional human activities. Swords tentatively suggests that the white material at the site might be oxalic acid, which would show white- ness, be very reflective, irritate and numb the skin, and sterilize the soil. If oxalic acid is involved, it appears that there is no likely conventional explanation as to how it got there. While Swords apparently feels the circle reflected the full moon present that night, Phillips provides evidence that the ring was itself producing the glow. For those interested in a very complete look at one of the most puzzling cases in ufology, this is an excellent book. The cover, while attractive and well done, is mis- leading, as it shows the object looking like a white mush- room, rather than as the multi-colored object described by the witness. Apparently the use of color for the cover was seen as too expensive, but it might have been better to have chosen something that more accurately reflects the facts. A helpful index is missing, but the witness tes- timony, detailed analyses, numerous photos, and detailed drawings make this the best documentation of a physical traces case ever printed. August 2002 MUFON UFO Journal Page 19"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"View from Britain By Jenny Randies Jciui) Randies Analysis of a window area As noted in my column last month, I have recently engaged in a research study of Britain's major window area-the Pennine Hills-a range that stretches.north-south down the middle of the country. The results of this analy- sis and many case histories are reported in my book Su- pernatural Pennines (Robert Hale, London, 2002). But since it seems unlikely to be given a US edition (it is rather too parochial for that, I imag- ine), T thought that I would re- veal some of the findings here. Historical Basis These moorlands-espe- cially the real center of activ- ity roughly in a triangle bounded by the outer suburbs of Manchester, Sheffield and Leeds-have generated a vast range of strange phenomena, from apparitions and time slips to sky falls and extensive pol- tergeist activity. T strongly sus- pect these are part of a continuum all linked to whatever eneruy source is powering the window area at such pro- digious levels. This hyperactivity is not a modern phenomenon. In- deed the Pennines has produced strange sightings right back into history. What today are reported to be glowing lights in the sky were seen in almost identical fashion centuries ago as being the eyes on a phantom beast or the result of the demonic actions of a \"boggart,\" as the local elemental beings are still known in some parts. You can even see the lasting consequence of this all over the region with place names such as Hob Tor (hob being an old name forthe devil, as in hob goblin), Devil's Elbow, and many more illustrating how the legends pep- per the landscape with supernatural connotations. It would not amaze me if 500 years from now future historians reflect on why certain locations have attracted neo- mythological names such as \"Alien's Lair\"! Facts and figures Although many odd things are happening in the Pennines, this analysis concentrates on UFO activity, which these days is by far the most prevalent anyhow. I calculated the number of UFO sightings over the past 40 years as related to the population density. Put simply this revealed that twelve times as many UFO sightings occur within the Pennine window as is the average for the UK. But the results go further. Some 93% of UK sightings are regarded as explained, leaving 7% (in fact 761 cases) considered unsolved. When you work out a similar figure for Pennine cases there are only 88% of cases solved, meaning that the level of unsolved cases in this region is nearly twice the national average. So, stranger cases are more likely to occur in this window area than they are out ofit. This trend is emphasised further when you look purely at close encounters (which I define as a case that has some actual effect on the environment-that is, it is not merely a sighting made geographically at close quarters). Nationally 2.8 % of cases qualify for that status, but in the Pennines it comes to a much greater 10.1 %. In other words close encounters are far more common within this window than they are outside of it.    =  '. The same is true when encounters with aliens are stud- ied. The UK figure is 107 (just over 1% of all sightings), but there are four times as many cases as this average within the Pennines. Indeed almost half of all British alien contacts have apparently happened there! Hot spots The study also broke down sightings according to the part of the window being studied. This revealed localized hotspots where activity is most intense. The real center of activity was clearly indicated as being on the moors between the Rossendale Valley of Lancashire (near Bacup) and the Calder Valley of West Yorkshire (around Todmorden). Although mostly a rural area with few large settle- ments and much desolate moor, this is way ahead in terms of the number of sightings. Indeed almost 10% of Pennine sightings occurred in this small area. Moreover, fully one quarter of all British alien contacts took place here, mak- ing it without much doubt the most likely concentrated area in the UK in which to be abducted-quite possibly in Europe. This is a tourist opportunity being missed! If anywhere, was crying out to be the home of some sort of permanent UFO monitoring site-or indeed the location of a UFO museum-it probably should be here. Whilst this fact is little known, it is the Scottish settlement of Bonnybridge applying to be twinned with Roswell, NM (a wonderful, if rather inappropriate, gimmick!) But I suggest that Bacup or Todmorden ought to apply to be twinned with the Twi- light Zone. Conclusions My analysis goes much deeper than this, also looking at such things as when sightings are most often made and assessing the way in which outbreaks of activity build up, expend themselves, and then die away (possible to do, given the wealth of strange activity being reported).

However, what is desperately needed is a serious in- vestigation of this window. Unlike many around the world, it is incredibly localized and well sited-within 40 miles of three major cities and within half an hour's drive of at least five universities. Much of it can be \"staked out\" with a minimum of effort. With a properly coordinated exercise involving the right equipment and goodwill on the parts of both science and the UFO community, a genu- inely positive initiative could be set in motion. This has already been code named \"Project Pennine,\" but the whole subject of UFOs remains shrouded in ridi- cule in the UK, preventing any direct action from occur- ring amongst the scientific community, to whom such an idea is little short of lunacy. Somehow we have to overcome this barrier, because I am absolutely convinced that if we can mobilize resources in this fortunately accessible and extraordinary active win- dow area, then we could come up with definitive evi- dence that really might make a difference in the battle to understand the UFO mystery. I see the Pennine window as one of the great missed opportunities of UFOlogy. It is high time that we took steps to persuade those who can make a difference that the time to do so has arrived. The chance of doing some- thing meaningful in this way is infinitely better than bad- gering Congress to \"come clean,\" or seeking evidential smoking guns through some indirect means. Here is the chance to be UFOlogically proactive in the best possible way, and we are squandering that opportu- nity.

September 2002 Bright Planets (Evening Sky): Venus, seen near the star Spica, can be glimpsed by northern observers only early in the month very low in the WSW at dusk. It sets about 8:45 on the 1st. Southern observers can continue to view the blazing planet much longer in the month. Venus achieves its maximum bril- liancy September 26 ai mj^mrude -4.6. Saturn (magnitude 0.0), in Orion, rises in the NE about 11:30PM in mid-month. Bright Planets (Morning Sky): Mars (1.8), in Leo, emerges in the morning sky late in. September, our ruddy neighbor then rises in the E soon after 5 AM. Jupiter (-1.9), in Cancer, improves its position, rising in the ENE about 2:30 AM in mid-month. Saturn stands high in the S at dawn. The ringed world lies 30 below the quarter Moon on Sept. 28. Moon Phases: New moon-Sept. 6 First quarter-Sept. 13 Full moon-Sept. 21 Harvest Moon Last quarter-Sept. 29 The Stars: During the mid-evening hours in mid-September the sky is evenly split between the summer stars in the west- ern half and the autumn constellations in the eastern half. The fall season's celestial symbol, the Great Square of Pegasus, is easi ly visible in the E, whi le the summer sym- bol, the Summer Triangle, remains high in the SW. For rural skywatchers, the Milky Way now passes di- rectly overhead from NE to SW, its best evening appear- ance of the year.

Friedman Absence of Evidence In their new book Shockingly Close to the Truth: Confessions of a Grave Robbing Ufologist, (Prometheus Press) James W. Moseley and Karl T. Pflock express their disdain for what they describe as \"a ufological mantra coined by Roswell crash advocate Stan Friedman: Absence of evidence is not evidence of ab- sence. While ihi-? is literally true, the real me^iue conveyed with body language and a knowing nod, is subliminal. Therefore evidence really does exist-Roswell crashed saucer parts, alien cadavers, 'smoking-gun' documents, you name it. This bit of Saucer Logic is more subtle than most, making the spoken words seem to mean much more than they actually mean. In truth the absence of evidence after a thorough inves- tigation is a strong clue that what was not found does not exist or did not happen, and common sense says go with that until contrary clues show up.\" The above is a great perversion of my approach to ufology. First of all I maintain a large \"Gray Basket\" con- taining those notions for which I don't have enough evi- dence to reach a conclusion. Secondly, with regard to Roswell, there is plenty of evidence, as reported, for example, in Crash at Corona: The Definitive Study of the Roswell Incident by Don Berliner and myself. Certainly eyewitness testimony is considered evidence by all judges. With regard to smok- ing gun documents, 1 discussed these in detail in my book TOP SECRET/MA JIC, in my 108 page \"Final Report on Operation Majestic 12,\" and in my MUFON 2000 paper \"Roswell and the Majestic 12 Documents in the New Millennium,\" among others. That 1 don't have a piece of a saucer and an alien body does not mean they don't exist, especially when one con- siders the obvious national security implications of them. Perhaps most important is that 1 have had great difficulty finding these so called \"thorough investigations\" on the part of debunkers. What I keep finding are proclama- tions, NOT investigations. There are many examples. Philip Klass challenged me about the pica type used in the June 14, 1954, memo about MJ-12 from Robert Cut- ler, Ike's National Security advisor, to General Nathan Twining, MJ-12 member, and USAF Chief of Staff. He proclaimed that the White House-based NSC used the smaller elite type and provided 9 samples to \"prove\" it. He offered me $100 for each genuine NSC document Page 22 using the same size and style pica type from the right time frame and that met certain criteria. Unfortunately, he set a limit of only $1000. He had not ever been to the Ike Library, which has 250,000 pages of NSC material, many of which were then still classified. 1 provided him with more than 20 examples (having spent weeks there), and he sent me a check for $1000. A copy is in my Final Report. Absence of evidence in his hands was NOT Evidence of absence. Also, it is hardly rational to claim that one can generalize from a mere 9 of 250,000 documents. Dr. Joe Nickel!, full time Senior Research Fellow for the self anointed \"Committee for the Scientific Investiga- tion of Claims of the Paranormal\" and, apparently, heir to Klass' UFO debunker throne, claimed years ago that the date format\" 18 November, 1952\" (note the comma) vio- lates the Government Style manual and, therefore, the Eisenhower Briefing Document is a fraud. His three degrees are in English, which as a physicist, I had not thought of as a science. He did not provide a copy of the style manual for 1952 and seemed to be to- tally unaware that genuine documents, especially limited distribution classified ones, have all kinds of date formats, usually depending on who is doing the typing. One file folder for the Office of the Secretary of Defense had seven different date formats. 1 found many examples of the day, month, comma, year format, including some by two of the MJ-12 members, both having been Directors of Central Intelligence: Roscoe Hillenkoetter, the briefing officer, and Walter B. Smith, his successor as DCI. I had published three short items from DCI Allan Dulles (Smith's successor) to General Goodpastor in Ike's Office, written within two weeks of each other, and each with a different date format, in my Final Report on Op. MJ-12. Absence of evidence in Nickell's hands was NOT evi- dence of absence. He had made a proclamation NOT an investigation. One can only wonder how much effort he made, if any, to check date formats. Many debunkers claimed that the Cutler-Twining memo was clearly fraudulent because the classification marking, \"Top Secret Restricted,\" was supposedly not used by the US government before President Nixon's time in 1968.1 had found examples of Confidential Restricted and Secret Restricted, but had not found any marked Top Secret Restricted. That certainly didn't mean there were no such items. First, we must recognize that Secret info cannot be included in Confidential documents, that Top Secret info cannot be included in Secret documents, and that TOP SECRET Code Word (sometimes referred to as SCl-Spe- cial Compartmented Information) data cannot be included in Top Secret Documents. We do know that there is TOP SECRET UMBRA (other code words might include Ul- MUFON UFO Journal August 2002"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"tra or Majic) UFO information because the National Se- curity Agency, in 1996, finally \"released\" 156 UFO docu- ments, previously withheld, which had that designation. None of the 19 archives I have visited have provided any TOP SECRET Code word documents that had been de- classified. Does this absence in my hands of TSR documents mean there weren't any? NO. The General Accounting Office group searching for Roswell-related classified documents all over the country noted (on page 80 of the GAO packet it sends out in response to FOIA requests about its Roswell work): \"December 7, 1994....reviewed records pertaining to the Air Forces atomic energy projects and certain mission and weapons requirements. These files were classified up to and including TOP SECRET. The period covered by these records was from 1948 to 1956. There was no mention of the Roswell Incident. No information pertaining to the assignment was obtained. In several instances we noticed the classification Top Se- cret Restricted, used on several documents. This is men- tioned because in past references to this classification (Majestic 12) we were told that it was not used during this period.\" I spoke with three GAO people. They could not pro- vide me copies of these TSR documents because they were still classified. Absence of evidence is NOT evi- dence of absence. In 1980, in response to a court-ordered search for their UFO documents, because the CIA had found 18 NSA UFO documents in its \"thorough\" search, the NSA found 156 NSA UFO documents, besides 23 CIA UFO docu- ments, not found by the CIA. The 21 legal page affidavit to a federal court judge justifying the withholding of these 156 NSA UFO documents was itself TOP SECRET (Code word-UMBRA-found out later). The affidavit was 75% censored when we obtained a copy under FOIA. In 1996 the NSA, in response to a new Presidential Executive Order, relaxed a little, and the new version of the affidavit was only 20% blacked out. They also claimed to have released the 156 NSA UFO Documents. Many people, such as Dr. Kevin Randle, hailed this decision as indicating there was no coverup- only classified information about intelligence sources and methods. Such a claim is truly amazing in that more than 90% of each page was censored using \"white-out\" rather than heavy black ink as in the originally-released, very heavily censored documents that have played so well for me on TV. I know of nobody who can read the text under the white-out. In addition, how could it be possible that more than 90% of each page mentioning a UFO deals with sources and methods information, and less than 5% deals with UFOs? There are still those saying nothing is being covered up. Sorry but absence of evidence is NOT evidence of absence. The CIA added its own misrepresentation. Though they had supposedly done a thorough court-ordered search for UFO documents, they had found only 18 of NSA's 156, and somehow had not managed to find any of the 23 CIA UFO documents which the NSA had later found (but could not release). It took me two years to get 9 of these, which were Eastern European newspaper articles which had not been classified, and another three years to get tiny portions of 4 (of 14) highly classified CIA ones on appeal. Three pages had 10 or fewer visible words. But we know from the proclamations of the debunkers that there is nothing being withheld, and that the blacked out material is all sources and methods information. Surely this is nonsense. Pflock, in his book Roswell: Inconvenient Facts and the Will to Believe (The third anti-Roswell book pub- lished by Prometheus) claimed there was no Roswell crashed saucer event, because it wasn't noted in any of a number of USAF UFO documents. Once again, none of these were classified TOP SECRET Codeword. They couldn't have contained TOP SECRET UMBRA infor- mation. These would not have been noted in any listing of lower classification. Pflock certainly knows this from his time at the CIA and as Assistant Deputy Director of Defense. He is well aware of the need-to-know principle so important for ac- cess to highly classified documents and projects. Finally, there are the outrageous claims that there is no evidence of sightings over big cities, no sightings by more than one witness, no radar cases, no sightings by meteorologists, or astronomers or pilots. So there is no evidence! All UFOs have prosaic explanations, and no people are taller than 7'! The fact is that one can find many examples in each of the above sighting categories, in such sources as Dr. James E. MacDonald's 71 -page testimony to the US Con- gress on July 29, 1969. This has 41 outstanding cases he personally investigated. It is available from UFORI, POB 958, Houlton, ME 04730-0958 for only $10.00, including postage. Ted Phillips has collected more than 5000 physical trace cases. Let us just pretend they don't exist, because they are absent from evidence in the hands of the UFO de- bunkers. To repeat my mantra, \"Absence of evidence is defi- nitely not evidence of absence.\" I will add another. \"Re- search by proclamation is NOT the same as research by investigation.\" Sept. 21-Pennsylvania Bigfoot Society 4th Annual East Coast Bigfoot Conference/Expo, Jeannette, PA www.pabigfootsociety@lycos.com. www.pabigfootsociery.com Sept. 28-National UFO Conference, 2002.

Schuessler MUFON International Director Successful 2002 UFO Symposium It is a pleasure to congratulate Jim Bouck and Bob Long and their New York MUFON team for hosting the very successful 2002 MUFON International UFO Sym- posium at the Hyatt Regency Hotel in Rochester, New York. The weekend event started early with a fabulous July 4 fireworks display, claimed to be the largest display in western New York. The annual MUFON State Director's meeting was an all-day event on Friday. Concurrently, the press conference was well attended and professionally conducted. It was a chance for the press to meet and inter- view the speakers. In addition, former MUFON Director of Investigations Dan Wright conducted a Field Investigator's Training session that was videotaped for use at future training sessions. The speakers' presentations on Saturday and Sunday were fresh and intriguing. The in- ternational scope of the UFO mystery was clearly demonstrated by speakers from across the United States, Canada, England and Turkey. In addition to the excellent speaker line-up, symposium attendees were treated to an introduction to the forth- coming SciFi Channel mini series \"Taken,\" presented by Director of Special Projects Larry Landsman. His pre- sentation included a special premiere showing excerpts from the series. Needless to say, no one left the audito- rium until it was over. Keeping with the tradition started by Walt Andrus many years ago, we continue to publish the Symposium Proceedings each year. The 2002 book is available from MUFON Headquarters, RO. Box 369, Morrison, CO 80465-0369, for $27.50 postage paid to U.S. addresses. For addresses outside the USA, please add $4.00 addi- tional for postage. Each year we dedicate the Proceed- ings book to a significant contributor in the UFO field. This year the dedication went to Betty Hill for her per- sonal lifetime of involvement, starting with her own ab- duction experience more than 40 years ago. MUFON Under Cyber Attack I think it is important for MUFON members to know that for the past couple of months the MUFON email site and webmaster have received an inordinate number of virus-laden messages. This has been a directed attack on John Schuessler MUFON by as of yet unknown criminals. Following the virus attacks, several MUFON addresses have been used via spoofing techniques by these criminals to send mes- sages carrying perverted attachments. You may be assured that if you receive one of these messages that it was not actually sent by MUFON, and we would like to hear about it. Whatever you do, do not forward any such messages to anyone. Instead, notify your email service provider's security representative and request assistance. New Field Investigators Kathleen Marden, Director for Field Investigator Training, has announced that the following Field Investi- gator Trainees have completed the Field Investigator's Exam and are now MUFON Field Investigators: Philip Dybala, Burr Ridge, IL; Sharon K. Jones, Hotchkiss, CO; Jeffrey M. Roy, Halifax, Nova Scotia; Nancy Smoot, Las Vegas, NV; Rein hold Stettner, Decatur, IL; and Edward Wayne Williams, Silver Springs, NV. Field Investigator Trainees are urged to study the MUFON Field Investigator's Manual and take the exam. The exam is provided free of charge by MUFON Headquarters. The price for the MUFON Field Investigator's Manual is $25 + $3.50 p&h. Position Announcements We are pleased to announce the appointment of two new MUFON State Section Directors.
